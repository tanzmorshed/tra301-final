"Brambo","10","857","1255","11 September 2004"," Review: Ensemble cast delivers top-notch performances in reflective drama
","In a drama strikingly reminiscent in style and tone of P.T. Anderson's film Magnolia (1999), the narrative in Crash shifts between 5 or 6 different groups of seemingly unconnected characters, whose relationships to each other are only revealed in the end.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with the David Cronenberg feature of the same name, this Crash is the feature-length, studio-released directorial debut of veteran Canadian TV writer/producer/director and two-time Emmy-winner Paul Haggis. An in-depth exploration on the themes of racism and prejudice, cause and effect, chance and coincidence, and tragedy, ""crash"" is a metaphor for the collisions between strangers in the course of day-to-day existence. Set over a 24-hour period in contemporary L.A., it is a social commentary on the interconnectedness of life in the big city.<br/><br/>Crash features a top-notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics.<br/><br/>Centering around two disturbing car accidents, a carjacking, vicious workplace vandalism, and the suspicious shooting death of one police officer by another, the drama is set against the backdrop of a racist LAPD and Los Angeles justice system. Action shifts between the various characters, whose lives collide with each other in unpredictable ways as each faces their own moral dilemma, and tries to cope with the consequences of their resulting decision made or action taken. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking, common conclusion, which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling.<br/><br/>Crash is backed by a solid and varied, original soundtrack and excellent cinematography. Sweeping, wider shots alternate with disjointed camera angles which convey the chaos and confusion of the characters and the unpredictability of life. Occasional lingering close-ups -- on occasion without sound -- capture the actors' facial expressions, which suitably detail key moments of the characters' aching pain, fear, anger, bitter anguish, remorse or grief, far better than any dialogue could.<br/><br/>This breathtaking film is destined to be a critical smash and box-office hit. Five stars."
"mercybell","10","667","985","13 May 2005"," Volatile Redemption
","""Crash"" is a complex movie with a simple premise: set in Los Angeles it follows 8 main characters (and many, many more supporting) from all walks of life and races whose lives intersect at some point during one 24 hour period. These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode.<br/><br/>The complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. Haggis' screenplay is so intricate and delicately written I couldn't begin to try to summarize the actual plot line (which destines this article to be kind of vague), but everyone meets everyone else at some point in the film (and there are a whole lot of characters). Sufficed to say these meetings are variably intense, casual, fleeting, dangerous, but they all effect the participants in profound and provocative ways, causing lives to find enlightenment or swerve violently, and watching it all unfold is mesmerizing because Paul Haggis (Oscar Nominated writer of Million Dollar Baby) made the film meaty with messy characters and topics and stories to chew and hurtle along with.<br/><br/>The all-encompassing theme of the film is racism, and it is dealt with bluntly, honestly, and without reservation. Every single character participates in the perpetuation of the ugly cycle but also suffers because of it. Where racism makes for an interesting enough subject for an already provoking and fairly experimental film (I was surprised to see this get wide release), it's only the catalyst for a deeper, resounding story of redemption and the universality of our lonely situation which the movie becomes during its second hour (what you could call Act II). It switches from a somewhat depressing contemplative amalgamation of moments about racism in everyday life and how destructive it is, to a throbbing, intense web of choices and consequences -- life and death, vivifying or soul killing -- and the chance at redemption.<br/><br/>Following their actions in Act I, everyone meets a fork in the road or is given a second chance of some sort. Some take it, some don't, but regardless, by the end of the movie everyone has changed. This is what gives the movie wings during its second hour, makes it interesting, keeps you guessing and on knife's-edge. It also gives the characters depth and souls and shows that despite perceived and upheld differences, when it comes down to it we aren't different (which we see in a shattering scene between Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate after Tate notices that he and Philippe have the same St. Christopher statue), in fact we desperately need each other. It's one of the few films I've seen where everyone is at fault somehow and yet there are no villains. It makes it hopeful, particularly with something as ugly as racism: everyone's fallible, but everyone has the capacity for good and nobility. That said, each of these character's inner struggles makes for all the conflict and resolution you need.<br/><br/>A talented ensemble drives the film, sharing almost equal amounts of screen time, but the folks who really stood out and had my full attention each time were Terrence Howard (plays a TV director), Matt Dillon (as a patrol cop), Sandra Bullock (a rich housewife), , Don Cheadle (a detective), and Michael Peña (a locksmith). These five gave deeply, deeply felt performances portraying a wide range of emotions and personal situations, giving souls -- alone, yearning, and searching in a world that doesn't seem to care -- to shells of imperfect people. But the actors triumph in little moments of human contact: a glance, an embrace, a pause, a smile, a wince, things that breath the film to life and with simple visuals give it profundity. This is beautifully illustrated in a small scene between the downward spiraling Jean (Sandra Bullock) and her maid after she's begun to realize all her problems may not be about the two black guys who car jacked her, but her own life.<br/><br/>Some closing notes: it's obvious it's a debut. At times the dialogue and acting can be stilted and unnatural; some of the initial ""racial"" situations seem forced; certain scenes could have used some editing or fine tuning, but by the end I didn't care. It also may be helpful to know that the first hour spends its time setting everything up for Act II, although it will seem more like a photo essay on racism than a setup. But by the time Act I ends you're ready for something substantial to happen, and at the perfect moment, stuff happens. I was entirely satisfied with this movie, I couldn't have asked for anything more. Still it's impressive, with his debut Haggis made a film that magically maintains a storytelling balancing act about people's lives that almost seamlessly flows, takes an honest look at racism with an understanding of mankind, a belief in redemption, and even hope. As I walked out of the theater into the rainy night it resonated with me and colored my thoughts as I made my way through the crowds of unknown fellow people filling the cinema. That's about all I can ask for in a film."
"Vitarai","10","676","1028","1 May 2005"," Roller-coaster of emotions
","Like Altman's classic Short Cuts, and Anderson's Magnolia, Crash, by writer/director Paul Haggis weaves a tale of multiple characters through the web of streets we have come to know as Los Angeles. Unlike those other two films this one has a very specific theme to explore. From the opening line uttered by Don Cheadle we know this is to be a film about how people relate, and from the interchange that follows between Jennifer Esposito and Alexis Rhee (pretty sure she plays the Korean female driver who rear-ended her) how people relate tends to be ruled by first impressions or prejudice.<br/><br/>Race is paramount in this film, and all our preconceptions of who people are get twisted and turned through the intricate plot. With each new additional character we find another assumption, another stereotype, and then watch as that preconception is obliterated as the character develops. It is a credit to the deftly written script, tight direction and exceptional acting talent that every one of these many characters is fully realized on screen without ever feeling one-dimensional.<br/><br/>I would love to discuss some of the details of what happens to explain how well it is done, but part of the magic of this film is allowing yourself to be taken on this ride. Mind you, this isn't a ride of pleasure. The first half of this film is unrelentingly in its ferociousness. I could literally feel my rage at some of the characters forming to a fever pitch. The fear and hatred I was confronting wasn't just on the screen, but in the pit of my stomach. And in one absolutely brilliant moment I was literally sobbing at the expectation of horror unfolding, only to be cathartically released in a most unexpected way.<br/><br/>Mr. Haggis was in attendance at the screening I saw and explained that the idea for this film came to him one night sometime after 9/11 at about 2a.m. when his own memories of a car- jacking experience from 10 years before wouldn't leave him alone. Clearly this film was his way of relieving those demons of memory, using the catharsis of his art to unleash them and in doing so has given to all viewers of cinema an opportunity to examine our own preconceptions about race relations and how we treat each other and think of ourselves. He mentioned in the discussion after-wards that he likes to make films that force people to confront difficult issues. Films that ask people to think after the film has ended and not just leave saying: ""that was a nice film"".<br/><br/>This isn't a ""nice"" film, and I would expect that it will provoke many a discussion in the ensuing weeks when it opens nation-wide. It's a discussion long overdue for this country, and it took a Canadian to bring the issue to the fore in this brilliant, thought provoking film."
"heymikey1981","4","182","266","7 March 2006"," Great acting ensemble but the movie left a bad taste in my mouth
","THE GOOD: The acting were great especially Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. Terrence Howard should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor instead of Matt Dillon.<br/><br/>THE BAD: I'm a visible minority (non-white) and I have experienced some form of racism in my life. BUT despite my life experiences and the movie's subject matter, I would definitely NOT say that this movie is the best of the year, in fact, it's FAR from it. I have problems with this movie both from a moviegoer's perspective and from a visible minority's perspective. Some of my problems with this movie are:<br/><br/>(1) Poor character development (or none at all). Just because we saw extremes in a character, for example, Matt Dillon being a racist cop and being a good caregiver to his ailing father, that does not mean in any way that the character is well-developed. Yes, I admit that in a big cast ensemble like in this movie, it is quite difficult for every character to be well-developed, BUT that does not mean that at none of the characters should be like that.<br/><br/>(2) The dialogue seems really contrived to the point that I'm really surprised this movie won for Best Original Screenplay. They should show this movie in a screenplay writing class NOT because it's good but to show students and future screenplay writers what NOT to do. I just felt like I've been hit by the head over and over again how bad racism is. I get it.<br/><br/>(3) The plot seems so coincidental, it is laughable. What are the chances of a black car robber running over an Asian guy who also happens to be a human trafficker while entering his van, and that same black car robber ended up carjacking that Asian guy's van several hours later after he brought him the hospital, only to find out that the several Asians being trafficked inside the van just to show you that the black car robber has a good side after all? Or, what about that scene where a prejudiced upper-class white woman who fell down the stairs and all her prejudice and hatred vanished into thin air? If it was THAT simple, why don't we throw every racist in America down the stairs so they will have a change of heart?<br/><br/>(4) I think my biggest misgivings about this movie is the unrealistic view of racism. As someone who has experienced racism in my life, the realistic view of racism is that it is hidden rather than in your face. I've been refused to enter a supermarket because I'm not white. Did the store owner said because I was not white? No, he said the store was closing even though there were a lot of people shopping inside. Did he yell racial slurs? No. Racism in America is more hidden. Some cab drivers probably won't stop to pick you up because you're non-white but that does not mean that they will try to run you over or get out and say racial slurs. If a Chinese woman rear-ended me, I won't be saying ""blake! blake! Learn some English bitch!"". On the other hand, if I was a Chinese woman and I accidentally rear-ended a Mexican woman, I won't say ""Mexicans are bad drivers"" in front of her face. That's not how things work. Instead, I would give out my insurance info, say sorry, and go home and tell my fellow Chinese friends and family that Mexicans are poor drivers and make fun of them behind their backs. That is the real racism. It's hidden and not in your face.<br/><br/>Anyway, Crash is not original unlike what some people may say. The interlocking and interweaving story lines, plots, and characters have been done before. ""Magnolia"" is a movie that does this much better than Crash did and yet, it was never nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars. It had a stellar cast -- Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman (who won best Actor recently), Tom Cruise, etc. It really boggles my mind how Crash was even nominated for Best Picture."

","There is good and bad in all of us. This movie explores this like no other. It will make you think about the nature of bigotry and stereotypes. The characters switch from heavy to hero in a way that is deeply moving and exhilarating. It is TV drama style writing where several different groups of characters and plots interweave (Paul Haggis) but with none of the limits of TV, it reminded me of ""Hill Street Blues"" which from me is a big compliment. I am a Don Cheadle fan and he captures the role. Sandra Bullock plays against character and pulls it off with ease. The most impressive performance to me was Ryan Phillippe's. Almost every nationality in LA was represented and they all were interesting and realistic. The ensemble cast and various plots blend together and keep your interest. Cast is great, music is haunting, writing is superb. Go see this movie."
"billkwando","1","383","629","19 October 2005"," Insults intelligence and cheapens the message, if there is one.
","I saw this ""movie"" partly because of the sheer number of good reviews at Netflix, and from it I leaned a valuable lesson. Not a lesson about ethnic diversity however...the lesson I learned is ""Don't trust reviews"".<br/><br/>Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but the people who actually need to see this movie are going to be the ones who are the least drawn to it and least affected by it if they DO see it. The only reason that I can think of for the number of good reviews is that it's being reviewed by people who aren't used to thinking, or who've seen their first thought-provoking movie and somehow think that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called ""Racism For Dummies"", as emotionally wrenching as possible, seemingly to give people who don't spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they've discovered some fundamental truth that's never been covered in a film before. Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintanence it's not... An after-school special for the unthinking masses, cut into bite-sized overwrought ham-fisted pieces to make it easier to swallow without too much introspection.<br/><br/>It's as if they portrayed everyone as being the worst possible extreme, simply to make us happy that we're such good people because we don't identify with the characters. Let's face it people. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). It's well acted (even if the dialog is atrocious) and cleverly executed, so much that you don't think to ask ""where's the beef?"" until you can tell the film is winding down. The flaming car scene was well executed, like much of the movie, but went nowhere in the end. <br/><br/>The messages are very heavy-handed, and from the ""behind the scenes"" blurb, the producers were clearly watching a different movie, because there is very little to laugh about in this movie, even during the intended funny parts. I have to stress that this is NOT entertainment, more like a high school diversity lesson...call it the ""Blood on the Highway"" of racism. They could even show this in high schools if it weren't for the ""side-nude"" shot of Jennifer Esposito.<br/><br/>In this film, everyone's a jerk and everyone learns a lesson (except for Michael Pena who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline).<br/><br/>This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.<br/><br/>Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things."
"tclark-5","1","564","941","2 May 2005"," Was I watching a different movie?
","I get the impression that I was watching a different movie to the majority of other people I know who have seen this film. It's not really that I found the film offensive or anything - just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it. I really respected Paul Haggis' work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was. It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the 'racism' version of Traffic, but I don't think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place. <br/><br/>The worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly spoon-feeds its audience. Does Haggisreally think we are so dumb as to require a shot of the blanks? Do wereally need to see the phone book sitting on Farhad's dashboard, withthe address circled in black texta? Can we not be left to make someleaps in logic for ourselves? <br/><br/>I also had a major problem with the dialogue which was so 'on the nose'. I have heard one critic say that the quality of dialogue is deceptively high, because even though people may not speak this way, they certainly do think this way. That is irrelevant. It is the job of a script like this to utilise dialogue in a way that helps add to the characterisations and believability of the (in this case highly implausible) situations that are set up. These characters all speak using the same voice and all they ever talk about is racism. <br/><br/>Surely the purpose of a film like this should be to promote the fact that race should not really be an issue in these situations, but by making it the sole focus of every scene, doesn't it become innately racist itself? Characters walk around spouting their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're regurgitating extracts from the research essay they've just written. It's utterly unconvincing and obvious. <br/><br/>A film should reveal its meaning gradually, not slap us in the face with it in the opening scenes and then never let up. I can see that Haggis' intentions with this film were honorable, but dare I suggest that by directing his own script he has not been able to identify and, therefore, overcome its flaws. I really hope that writer/directors will be really careful in future when approaching this 'mosaic' style of narrative. It has been done well a number of times, but getting the balance between the personal and the political right is very difficult. And Robert Altman will not be outdone in that department."
"WriterDave","9","427","737","7 May 2005"," Bold and Compelling Treatise on Racism in Modern Society
","Take the pop-cultured infused socio-political discourse of a Spike Lee movie, the glossy grit of a Michael Mann LA crime story, and the compelling mosaic story-telling technique of a Paul Thomas Anderson film, and you'll get the ""feel"" for Paul Haggis' stunning directorial debut. To boil a film like ""Crash"" down to such terms, however, would do it severe injustice. Powerful and thought provoking, this is the most accomplished and compelling film since ""21 Grams"" premiered back at the end of 2003.<br/><br/>""Crash"" brilliantly shows through intertwining vignettes, that are often blazingly funny in their brutal honesty and fascinatingly gut-wrenching in their melodrama, how subtle racism (often guised in nervous humor) and overt prejudice (often exasperated by sudden irrational violence and an overabundance of readily available firearms) completely permeate our culture and everyday interactions within society. A hyper intelligent script showcases not characters, but brilliant representations of real people, people we know and pass in the street every day, people not unlike us. People who at first seem to be lost causes in the war against racism (witnessed in Matt Dillon's harried beat cop and Sandra Bulluck's spoiled District Attorney's wife) can often become the most unlikely solutions to the problem, while people who ride in on their high horse (witnessed in Ryan Phillipe's noble young police officer) can turn against the tide in the blink of an eye. No one is immune to it no matter how hard they try to rise above it (witnessed in Don Cheadle's quietly tragic detective).<br/><br/>In the end, everyone is flawed, the racism is inescapable, and the audience feels a twinge of sympathy for just about everyone. Perhaps that is what Haggis is hinting at to be our answer. Showing empathy and being able to relate even on the most remote level to every human being out there is the first step to that true brotherhood of man. Because the film offers no real solution, the discussion and discourse it creates in the minds of the viewers is the first step in solving society's ills. We can't tackle everything at once, but we can open a dialogue, and hopefully, one person conversing with another will be the first step to our salvation. It takes a bold film to raise such questions, and an even greater one to compel an audience to talk about the potential answers, and that is exactly what ""Crash"" accomplishes."
"cofemug","1","167","278","27 February 2006"," ...And Burn
","I wrote this as a two part review. Part two has spoilers.<br/><br/>Part 1: <br/><br/>No, this isn't that one about the sex with car accidents. This is the one about racism in L.A. You know, the one where everybody is a racist, and race is the topic on everybody's mind at all times. Race.<br/><br/>Its like the movie has a form of turrets syndrome where race is the constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Race Relations. Relay race.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis made a movie which took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnect of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into a 1'53"" mental vomit about racism in America. RACE. In the 24 hour period we have 7 stories running parallel all connected and about race. The first hour, people say ridiculous stuff and do absurd things in an effort to be real about racism in America.<br/><br/>For example, the story with Ludicrous and Larenz Tate provides the comic relief. Too bad, the first half of their story is lifted straight from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction. RACISM. Their section is the Quentin Tarantino section where, instead of being cool and talking about foot massages and religion, the characters talk about race and racism. CONSTANTLY. <br/><br/>The other good thing about it is the Mexican story when the Mexican guy is talking to his daughter. He gives her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her from bullets. Decent writing, but that's only because the writers have had daughters and know what they would say in his place.<br/><br/>The rest of the stories are extremely ludicrous. The Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene where he's trying to get the lock fixed and the Mexican tells him he needs a new door is abbreviated and stupid. Why would anybody act like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the convenience store clerk from The Doom Generation. ""Six Dollar Sixty Six Cents girly."" If i ever watch the second half of the movie, I hope his head is shot off and his bodiless head starts coughing up relish.<br/><br/>I haven't mentioned race in over a paragraph. RACE. RACISM. RACE FOR THE SUN. Better. Then, there is the black guy who wants to be white, Matt Dillon who has a chip on his shoulder against blacks, Ryan Phillippe who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors acting badly with bad dialog. When Matt Dillon molests the black producers wife, could I help it if I was cracking up? When Philippe is second guessing his writing up of his partner for racism, can I help but crack up? The movie is so funny when it is being racist. Racist. RACIST I tell you.<br/><br/>Now, mind you, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and Best Editing, besides a nod to Matt Dillon who actually did attempt to do a decent job. Who was paid off for that one, I have no clue.<br/><br/>Don't see it unless you feel like being preached at about the racism in society through a bad and unrealistic script from 2 white men over fifty who have no semblance of reality or interaction with real society in any way shape or form.<br/><br/>D- <br/><br/>Part 2:<br/><br/>The second half of Crash takes any and all story lines in the first half...and spews them back out in a sort of redemptive, conclusionary, the world is a big coincidence kind of way. And it is in fact one of the worst ways to do it.<br/><br/>Take 1999's Magnolia. People weren't conveniently tied together over and over again. They were just connected in a strange way that happens more often than you think. You know somebody who knows somebody who did something that you knew somebody else was also involved in. Crash takes this wrapping into a serious extreme.<br/><br/>The stories are lined up so everybody meets again. Are there only 5 on the LAPD force? Aren't these people working weird shifts? Dillon and Philippe were a late shift then an early one the next day? And, why did Tate have to be the murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't it have had more emotional tension, as well as realism, if it had been somebody we had not been following all day long? Like Phillippe just picks up a random hitchhiker and then freaks out. Everybody'd be freaking out.<br/><br/>Eventually, in the second half, the touching invisible cloak scene is used to get the Hindi to shoot the daughter. It ticked me off and made me feel dirty. Not that the Hindi shot the daughter, but that they created a beautiful touching scene and then had it be the direct cause of people tearing up. It really ticked me off. At the writers, not the scene.<br/><br/>The whole movie is fake and totally uncalled for. The coincidences are far too many and they require an extreme suspension of disbelief. Unlike Magnolia which was connected mildly, this had connections upon connections upon connections which were just so over-the-top. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock falls down the stairs. She doesn't die though. She should have. I cheered when she fell.<br/><br/>The worst part about the movie is it pulls a Magnolia. Not just in structure, but it has a montage over the song In the Deep where you see everybody being depressed. Magnolia took this and had post-modern commentary on it by having all of the characters singing along to Aimee Mann's Wise Up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to make commentary on a movie which won't be made for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow.<br/><br/>Utter waste of my time.<br/><br/>First half: D-; Second half: lowest grade ever; Overall: F---"
"sweeneyle-internet","1","271","464","23 July 2005"," Disturbing
","I agree with what so many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of this film's examination of racism. It is baffling to me that so many people seem to have been fooled by its pretentiousness. I want to comment on the Matt Dillon character as an example of what's most infuriating about this movie. Here we have a man who -- contrasted with the film's underlying message that ""we're all a LITTLE racist"" -- effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliating her husband and deliberately goading him to make a move that, as he well knows, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does all this after pulling the couple over without any legal cause but because, as we come to understand, they are black and wealthy and he is a hurt little boy who is now the police and can therefore do as he pleases. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is evil. It is disturbing to me that this extreme of racism is held up next to another character's behavior -- spouting her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence -- to illustrate that everybody's a LITTLE racist. Later, we're spoon-fed some tripe about Dillon's poor old dad and how black folks drove him into the poor house. Is this supposed to explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? And is Dillon's character meant to redeem himself by committing the utterly unmotivated and unbelievable, laughably coincidental act of saving the woman he sexually assaulted the very night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some kind of self-congratulatory admiration for this film makes me feel sad about the shallowness of our understanding of racism, and our apparent lack of commitment to condemning and ending it."

It isn't. It lacks any subtlety.<br/><br/>Everything that happens is telegraphed and then gone over again in case you missed the explanation.<br/><br/>For a film like this to convince and move the audience it has to be represent the ambiguity of the characters and their motivation and actions; not simply present it as a series of 180 degree changes in each character's actions.<br/><br/>Half way through I really wanted to waste no more time on it, but I thought I would stick with it in case it improved; big mistake I should have stopped then - it simply got worse."

","The film's tagline is ""You think you know who you are. You have no idea."" I reject both the suggested idea that I have no idea who I am and the inferred suggestion that this film tells me who people truly are. If people in real life are really like this, then man, we're screwed.<br/><br/>A bilious film that I walked into late and left prematurely. A film which is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming The Race Film of All Time that it loses sight of the very tools a film must use.<br/><br/>The rules of Hollywood are such: if you show something in the first half, it must be used in the second half. Thus the gun that the daughter worries about her father buying will somehow find its way into the story in the second half. The rules of Hollywood are to make dialog 'real' - a concept which changes with every decade. Is this 'real dialog' somehow less ludicrous than the 'real dialog' of Kevin Smith ten years ago? The rules of Hollywood state that we set the scene, and as action rises, the camera moves in closer to the faces - in this film primarily so we can see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame-rate slows down, and our heart is meant to break.<br/><br/>This film is as crassly manipulative as it is vapid. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I freely admit, so to combat this prejudice I will not say that this is a natural situation stemming from the location, but rather probably from the author and director. The writer, Paul Haggis, already showed a taste for polemics over humanity in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make the vision of the film bring out the best of a script's ideas. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera it becomes obvious that not only does he not know how to write true, natural human drama, he does not know how to photograph or direct it as well. Paul Haggis comes from the land of TV, let us not forget: the land of diminished expectations.<br/><br/>Everything is as obvious as a TV-movie, simply presented for simple minds - Haggis drills into us, over and over again, that while on the surface people may seem to be awful, they have secret pains hidden. This is a nice idea, but so hamfistedly presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad/good has an amateurish feel. Structurally the film is broken up, in the tradition of Magnolia and other earlier films. The editing is as typical and conventionally ""cinematic"" as could be - if there is a dramatic movement, such as a door opening or a car driving past between the subject and camera, the editors use that extreme movement to give the cut that occurs there a more kinetic quality. The problem is that other than the drive to keep things moving, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is kept by the books. Not only are the puppets of this hideous racial punch and judy show ineptly handled, but even the curtains are lowered and raised with incompetence.<br/><br/>The film tries desperately to present reality, but there's just no talent whatsoever. Some of the actors are good, some of the actors are bad, and all of the performance get muddied together, brought down by the low, low aesthetics of the film. We have cinematography which is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear understanding of what is happening. However, not only is the cinematography unremarkable, but it is thoughtless camera-work and framing which believes that it actually is inspired. The result is little stylistic flourishes which one recognizes but do not actually add anything to the drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - as a father holds his dying child (the father might be shot too, I didn't stick around to find out) the camera sees his face and gives us the famous Vertigo track/zoom. The Vertigo shot!!! It was at this point that the film became hysterical and I just had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I left because I was in the middle of a crowded theater, and I wanted to express to the audience that I was sick of emptyheaded Hollywood 'art' which is full of sound and fury, yet signifying nothing (in the Bard's own words). I hate to waste such good Shakespearian references on something this remarkably bad."

","I can not believe the positive reaction to this movie. I had great expectations for it and was disappointed. First of all, they used every cheesy racism cliché in the book. It was so predictable. For instance, from the second the young Latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a gangbanger. Matt Dillon's character has been played a million times, a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie. The predictability hardly ended with those characters. A phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script. The morals of the story were PC to the max. There were a few clever twists but not nearly enough. The dialouge was embarrassing at times. It wasn't all bad.I just can't believe this movies high score so far. It was somewhat entertaining, just a little insulting to ones intelligence. I admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short."

","After seeing this movie, I was able to really understand what ""Six Degrees of Separation"" means. There is a thread that weaves its way through the landscape of life connecting, influencing, and defining all. This movie is certainly thought-provoking, one cannot watch it without feeling either privileged to have become part of the fabric, or like a fly on the wall - seeing, yet unable to influence or guide. There is almost a sense of frustration at ones inability to be no more than an observer in this movie since it compels you to want to shout in warning, gasp in shock, cry in sorrow, and hold in comfort. ""Crash"" is definitely not a movie to use as a venue to escape life for a couple of hours, but it is a movie that certainly makes you take a second and third look at who you are within yourself. The actors are surprising not only for their depth of performance, but also because they do not play characters you think you know. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes drama, action, comedic relief, or just an appreciation for a well-thought out movie."

"mdmc-1","1","81","136","12 March 2006"," The Worst Best Picture
","""Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away (Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (1986))?"" Or have I crossed over into some alternative ""Twilight Zone"" universe where ugly is beautiful and bad is good? On March 5, 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did something so inexplicable that my head is still spinning. The Academy voted one of the worst films ever made, ""Best Picture."" You heard me right, ""Crash"" is one of the worst films ever made. No, ""Crash"" isn't bad in the way of ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" ""Crash"" is bad because it thinks it is so good and that its message is so important that it bears repeating over and over and over again until everyone gets it. But what is the message of ""Crash?"" There seems to be some confusion about this aspect of the film which I will clear up for you. In its simplest form, the message of ""Crash"" is, people can be categorized into racial stereotypes and it is understandable that we are prejudiced towards them. For example, the film shows us that all young black men are carjackers and criminals and it is perfectly justified for white women to fear them. All Asians, but especially Asian women, are bad drivers and talk funny. Another example is that all white cops are prejudiced against blacks. Even white cops that appear to be good on the outside are all racists. When the least bit frustrated white cops will molest black women instead of kicking the dog, and white cops will shoot young black men in the blink of an eye for simply reaching in their pocket. Rich, white women all hate Hispanics and treat their Hispanic maids like dirt. Black women are all drug addicts on welfare or have funny names. Okay, maybe that's only one of the messages of the film. I guess another message of ""Crash"" is that everyone is prejudiced towards some race and that includes the writer, director, and producer. Well, to be fair, the writers (Haggis and Moresco, director (Haggis), and the many producers are just prejudiced toward blacks, Asians, and Persians; they have no problem with Hispanics. Hispanics are the only good people in the film and have no prejudices. Oh, I forgot! Hispanics are prejudiced against bad driving, funny talking Asian women. Another ""Crash"" message is that, if you're having a bad day, if you're father is having health problems, of course you're going to be a racist. After all, isn't everyone? I know you're confused now because you and so many others were tricked by the film into believing that it was against racism. Don't feel bad because the writers and director of ""Crash"" use every trick in the book to manipulate you into thinking that, because they had some noble cause for making the film it is appropriate to use racial stereotypes. After all, the Academy had no problem with it so why should you.<br/><br/>Okay, so the message of ""Crash"" is that racial stereotypes exist and everyone is prejudiced is kind of disgusting, but does that in itself make it one of the worst films? No, there are countless other flaws with the screenplay that make this film one of the worst. The only positive thing I can say about the script is that it is going to be a great teaching tool to show students what not to do when writing a screenplay. For example, in the very first scene of the film, Don Cheadle and his partner, Jennifer Esposito, get into a minor car accident. Cheadle then says the following, ""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" Can anyone explain to me why the Academy awarded this ""Best Original Screenplay?"" It's like it was written by some pretentious high school student trying to show off to the teacher.<br/><br/>Besides the clunky, pretentious dialog, the screenwriters overuse irony to a degree I can't remember seeing in any other film. It's like they are going to hit us over the head with irony until we just know what great writers they are. After this film, Congress should pass a law limiting impossible ironic coincidences and ironic twists to no more than two per film. Hefty fines should be levied for each one over the limit. By my count, there are a minimum of 15 ironic coincidences or twists in ""Crash."" How many can you come up with? Maybe this could be a fun party game like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.<br/><br/>I want to give one more specific example of the many problems with screenplay, but I'm hard pressed to talk about just one. Maybe it should be the carjackers, or maybe the invisible cloak or the second car crash. I just can't decide. Well, I'll just end with snow. On at least a few occasions, different characters in the film mention that the weather calls for possibility of snow in Los Angeles (the last time it snowed in LA was 1962). At the end of the film, white flakes fall from the sky, but they are the ashes from a burning car which was the site of a racially motivated murder. I'm not sure what the screenwriters had in mind with this scene, but I'm sure it was another heavy-handed allusion to something very deep. Maybe it was the ashes of racial hatred raining down on the city? And again, the Academy voted this Best Picture."

"roninred","Null","57","94","2 March 2006"," Crash is a non-LA persons view of LA.
","I've lived in LA for 13 years of my young adult life, on the Westside and also in depressed neighborhoods near downtown (Echo Park, home of the Rampart Division scandal and previously the precinct with the highest murder rate in the US) and I have to say that this is not the LA that I know. In watching the film it looks like some non-Californian's, non-LA person's perspective on race relations in LA. The characters are exaggerations, the overwhelming focus on black/white relations obscures the multi-racial fabric of the LA landscape, and the Asian characters (eg. one is smuggling Chinese illegal aliens, and another is screaming racial epithets) are the worst kind of stereotyping. The only portrayal in the film that is accurate is of the corrupt cops, which as anyone who lived through the Rodney King years 1992 will tell you are all too real. But then the film turned around and offered redemption for that bastard cop by allowing him to rescue the same woman he molested/raped? What kind of crap is this! That's not even counting the stylistic choices made in the film to try to make LA look like Chicago and New York, with people wearing scarves and such and having it snow in the city (as if that would ever happen!). People in LA rarely ever wear scarves, because it is rarely that cold, and the way they made the characters do this shows that this film is made about other cities in the US, and only used LA as the background because of the controversial nature of the 1992 riots.<br/><br/>I would have to say that based on my experiences in LA I have seldom seen people engage in outright racial slurs, because they know they will get beat down pretty quickly. Additionally, for Angelenos who have grown up in local multiracial high schools, the mere fact that people grow up living next to and learning with people of many different types encourages greater understanding of difference. If there are racial issues at certain local high schools, they are more often caused by gang conflict over turf issues than by internal prejudice. Maybe the racial dynamics mentioned in the film hold for people in other cities, but they're not walking the same streets, riding the same buses, and talking to the same people in the community as I have. In fact, I would argue that the biggest problems are caused by all the starry eyed hillbillies that move to LA from places outside of California and bring their prejudices with them. This movie is terrible, and the fact that people have made a big fuss about it is evidence of how out of touch people are with LA."
"awalter1","3","58","96","28 February 2006"," aesthetically and intellectually offensive
","Contrived, self-conscious, obvious, repetitive, manipulative, heavy-handed, pretentious--apparently these qualities do not count against a film today, at least as far as critics and major awards organizations are concerned. Roger Ebert called ""Crash"" his favorite film of 2005, and the Academy Awards gave the film more recognition than I would have thought possible--even considering the large quotient of lowbrows in Hollywood today. To put it as kindly as possible, ""Crash"" presents us with a shockingly manipulative story and treats delicate social issues with all the subtlety of sledgehammer blows. In essence, it is a bad knock-off of John Sayles, and you would do much better treating yourself to a very fine film like the criminally-neglected ""City of Hope"" (1991) or ""The Sunshine State"" (2002).<br/><br/>I should make it clear I wasn't disappointed at all in the performances or the look of the film. No, the trouble is something a bit deeper than that. As far as plot goes, there's this strange obsession in ""Crash"" with making every character experience a major ""reversal."" Good cop becomes bad cop; bad cop becomes good cop; innocent, victimized Middle Easterner becomes a perpetrator of violence--etc. And you can see all of this coming a mile away. Can Hollywood get any more heavy-handed and contrived than this? Well, let's hope not. Additionally, the movie seemed to be telling us that everyone in L.A. is a super-charged racist forever on the edge, ready to blow his or her top at any moment. Messages like this only serve to simplify social issues in a disastrous manner.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""Crash"" is classic kitsch: It shows you something for which you, as a product of liberal modernity, have a pre-loaded response. It makes you feel good about not being a racist and about deploring violence. It requires you to do zero intellectual work and then pats you on the back for having the correct ethical orientation toward the subject matter.<br/><br/>Personally, I don't think there's ever a good reason for talking down to your audience, and ""Crash"" is full of that. This type of story is every bit as bad as, on the other hand, elitist art that is only trying to communicate with a minute, intellectual clique. The ideal situation, I think, is for artists to treat their audience as thoughtful adults, and for the audience, in turn, to behave like thoughtful adults. Throughout ""Crash,"" I felt Haggis was treating me like, at best, an adolescent who can only be impressed by broad strokes and the most obvious, belabored themes. In his book ""The Art of Fiction,"" John Gardner talks about the bad storyteller being like a playwright who wants to run on stage every few minutes during a performance of his play and point out how every story development and technique is operating--and that is Haggis all over. He constantly shows his ""puppeteer's hand.""<br/><br/>Finally, I'm just getting exhausted by seeing people beating that dead horse of racism, over and over and over, in the media... For my money, a movie director is going to have to come up with a deeper, more ingenious approach if he wants me to listen to more of these preaching-to-the-choir sermons. Thankfully, there are directors like John Sayles who still have the talent to pull it off, and with panache."

Those of us familiar with LA will recognize the icons of the city and the mix of cultures.

","This is a good movie if you are the type of person who needs everything spelled out for you, be taught moral lessons and have political statements preached to you. Obnoxiously slapping the audience in the face with its self-righteousness in every scene, Crash manages to be become the only film to which I have 'awarded' the lowest score to on IMDb: 2/10. I can't even believe how terrible this film is. I don't even know what the 2 is for because no redeeming aspects come to mind as I write this.<br/><br/>The content is racism, if that wasn't clear enough. The events in the film are all shadowed by racial prejudice. The characters are all of different races. All people ever talk about in the film is racism. They do not talk about it casually as a means to make the dialog believable or accessible but whatever is said are readily-made, perfectly-crafted speeches on racist issues that sound like they've been taken from an opinion column in a political magazine. <br/><br/>So Crash drills these things into your head at all times, thereby cheapening its message -- which is, essentially, that racism is bad and that we stereotype based on race (0/10 for originality!). Ironically, what is most disturbing about the film is not the racial stereotypes that are present, but that American audiences NEED to be told these things and need such obvious morals to be spelled out for them and need a guy like Haggis shaking their finger at them telling you that is bad behaviour. This fills me with concern for the intelligence of the average movie-goer. After all, how can you applaud a film that states the obvious?<br/><br/>The icing of the cake of a dreadful film for me was the scene in which the little cutesy Latina girl is 'shot', trying to protect her father (Hispanic guy whose name I cannot recall as the only thing that is put forward in Crash is a person's race). As she jumps in front of her father to take the bullet for him there is THE cheesiest most ""sorrowful"" score imaginable playing loudly and the American flag blowing in the wind in the background of the shot. This scene is one of the worst, cheapest in film history. Who can honestly sit and watch that with a straight face?<br/><br/>I can only assume that the big budget of Crash was spent on late night taco-runs as nothing of substance is presented to us. Offensively poor writing, contrived performances, endless clichés make this simply an unwatchable film. To call it manipulative is giving it too much credit as that implies the clever disguise of intentions and messages and Crash does not even try to disguise anything -- it just preaches. <br/><br/>2/10"

","Devoid of any subtlety whatsoever, CRASH purports to portray the state of race relations in Los Angeles. Well, if CRASH were indeed accurate with respect to its depiction of race relations in Los Angeles, with which the Academy voters seem to agree, then I sure am glad I live in New York City.<br/><br/>Extremely didactic and bombastic, CRASH has reduced racial politics into diluted, mind numbing stereotypes and extremely broadly written characters that are nothing more than caricatures. CRASH takes the easy way out, does not, and indeed cannot, with its large number of players on its canvas, delve into character complexities or at least try to mimic, if not actually depict, the way real people deal with racism. Among its embarrassment of extremely unrealistic scenes (and the film is replete with them), a rich, well-mannered white woman (of the noblesse oblige variety) hurled insults at a Latino locksmith who is changing the lock of her front door and, within his earshot, accused him of planning to sell the key as soon as he gets the opportunity to do so. What instead would have been realistic was for this character to express her concerns to her white husband a couple of rooms away in their large luxury home with no one else in the room.<br/><br/>Such white woman is somehow redeemable from this faux pas with the Latino locksmith because cheap redemptions abound in this movie: this rich white woman later slips down the stairs and, lo and behold, the only one who tended to her injuries was her Latina maid. And just like that, the rich white woman declared that her Latina maid, whose services were paid for by her and her husband, was her ""best friend."" Presto! Her earlier treatment of the locksmith is forgiven.<br/><br/>The film also places up front and center a white racist cop who also happens to be his father's caretaker. He treats black people like 3rd class citizens, but Paul Haggis would almost make it seem that this character's racist attitudes were balanced out by his having to care for his father. I would further argue that Haggis posits that racism is excusable when one has other personal concerns in his or her life, and that is simply indefensible. Racism cannot be excused by one's family duties, no matter how overwhelming they may be. And, as with the white woman mentioned above, a cheap redemption also awaits this white racist cop. A black woman he earlier molests in front of her black husband is caught in a car about to explode. And who comes to this woman's rescue, well it's none other than this racist-molesting cop! And at the end of this sequence, we are supposed to feel sympathy for this cop, when arguably it is a combination of his duty as a cop as well as his instinct of self-preservation (after all he was in the car that was about to explode with the black woman he earlier molested) that truly motivated his ""heroic"" efforts.<br/><br/>Racism is not reducible to mere black and white. Racist cops are nothing novel: just recall the Rodney King case, the Abner Louima scandal and the Amadou Diallo news stories. Racism in the real world, or at least the world that is outside the bubble that is Los Angeles, however, festers beneath the surface, is much more subtle and covert. It's when I used to walk around the malls as a teenager and was constantly followed by the security guards and sales staff asking me if I needed assistance, while white kids roamed about the store free from the prying eyes and intrusive conduct of store management. They are comments passed seemingly innocuously by people who tell me that they could never tell between Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos and other Southeast Asians because they all look the same. It's when people assume that no black person who works as a secretary or receptionist could ever speak non-broken English.<br/><br/>And subtleties like these are what CRASH is glaringly missing. In this day and age, if there is one thing we do with respect to this most sensitive of topics, we DO NOT vocalize our misconceptions/beliefs toward certain races and minorities absent heated confrontations or inebriated/altered states, and, more importantly, shout out these beliefs within the presence or earshot of members of the aforementioned groups.<br/><br/>CRASH would have us believe that everyone walks around so wound up and ready to lash out a racial epithet to anyone and everyone whose skin color and/or cultural background happen to be different from yours: be it your girlfriend, someone you got into a car accident with, your hired help, and policemen in the guise of performing their civic and professional duties. And if Haggis really wanted to portray ""duality"" in that everyone has good and bad within them, then why did he carve out exceptions for Asians, as exemplified by the film's Asian male character and his wife, who the film deemed as the ONLY irredeemable characters in the its throughline? CRASH has dumbed down racism to the point that if someone tells me they feel like they learned something about themselves from viewing the film, I feel nothing but pity for them because they obviously have not experienced racism and they either live in an extremely homogeneous society or not in the real world at all. There is nothing novel about CRASH, and there are no lessons to be learned from it that are not self-evident when one just steps outside one's home.<br/><br/>CRASH fails in every way possible to show accurately racism and the true evil it is. Racism is complicated and for a project this ambitious, CRASH should not have been rewarded with the Best Picture Oscar especially when it failed in all respects--artistically, technically and otherwise--from achieving its, admittedly, lofty goals."

","I just watched Crash. This movie was way over the top and let me know almost right away it was not deserving of best picture. I was engladdened at first because it seemed like it might be another Magnolia type movie, but in the end the only comparison to Magnolia was the neat hippie music and the lack of resolution in many (try every one) of the story lines. Racism was a central theme, but as it pertained to this story it was a seemingly desultory, random element that was artificially injected at random points. The racism was extremely unnatural and forced and out of place in many instances. The result was that the movie came across not as being edgy and truthful like people are pretending this movie is, but rather ignorant and contrived at best. For example, the crack by Cheadle about ""all those cultures getting together and deciding to park their cars on their lawns"" was from left field and artificially inflammatory coming from a character who previously and thereafter gave us no racist indicators at all. There were no clues up to that point or after that he was racist or capable of such a statement (it was out of place in the conversation too), and the line had no place in his character or in the movie. And no, saying ""everyone is racist and that's why he said it"" is not true and not acceptable. The line was out of character, out of place, and therefore without taste. Some of the stories were good, but only up until race was artificially inseminated all over the screen. Additionally the whole movie was highly predictable. The scenes with the shopkeeper, the gun, the dead kid at the beginning of the movie, etc. - all predicted easily by me (and if I can predict events in a movie that is not a good thing at all). The clincher though that was the bizarre late night country music ""I feel like picking up a random black youth in an apparent act of kindness and then ignorantly and confrontationally stereotyping him to his face even though it is out of my character and it was in fact my partner who was the racist one, not me"" scene with Ryan Pillippie's character (who also presented no pre or post incident racist tendencies). What the heck was that? That should have been a deleted scene. On top of all this, the movie needed another 30 minutes at least to at least bring one or two more stories to conclusion. The Phillippe thing and the Cheadle Latino crack really bothered me the most though. I mean, I could buy the Sandra Bullock snooty rich white lady thing, but the rest was way too much. I think the fact that someone wrote a movie that says all people are racist says quite a lot about the writers and all the people involved, but says nothing about society as the movie had no realism whatsoever. The movie was almost complete in it's failure, but for Hollywood to admit that would mean so much more than just pretending it makes some kind of awe-inspiring statement about race. I hate to tell them and all of Hollywood that hailed this movie, but this has already been done and with more success (although still flawed) in the movie Grand Canyon. It is a far superior movie with race as the central theme. It was challenging and in your face and honest in the way Crash wishes it was, but with an inferior cast and far far less hype. If Hollywood really wanted to embrace racism being pushed to the forefront and being examined, then Bamboozled would have won best picture the year it came out (or at least been nominated)."

","Well, my friends, I finally got up the gumption to see ""Crash"" this week so I could decide for myself. I really did want to believe that it had best picture quality. And putting it succinctly, it was a revelation. And the revelation was how to make a totally unbelievable set of circumstances such that it leaves the audience no opportunity to interpret anything at all. The film started about 7:50 and by 9 I was practically shouting at the screen, ""Are we supposed to be taking this seriously?"" GIVE ME A BREAK! Then when the scene where the Iranian man fired the gun at the locksmith, I just completely lost it. I told my partner very forcefully, ""I'm leaving."" He pleaded for me not to, that it was almost over. I repeated, ""I'm leaving,"" and I marched out of the theater, threw my leftover popcorn and soda into the garbage (where I believe the film should be thrown), sat down in the lobby and cried for five minutes with my face in my hands, I was SO upset. How any thinking person could have selected that piece of garbage for a Best Picture Oscar -- completely unbelievable situations, contrived and manipulative dialog, amateurish camera work not even good enough for an SVU episode, and the feeling that I had been repeatedly bashed over the head with hate by means of a sledgehammer? I don't have time for that kind of anti-artistic expression in the remaining years of my life. I might also point out that of the 70 some odd speaking roles in the film, there was not a single gay character portrayed. Talk about unrealistic for the city of Los Angeles! The only thing that could have improved the film would have been a top-flight director and not the writer. Let me compare ""Crash"" to the 2003 British film ""Love Actually,"" which also has multiple diverse plot lines coming together at the end.

"the_Poppuns","1","61","103","22 March 2006"," Wacky Comedy about La La Land
","And I mean to say it's about a fantasy world. I've never been to LA but I can't believe a major metropolis like the one in this movie exists in this universe or even in an evil parallel universe. The reason I describe it as a comedy is that it became that for me. Because very early in the film there are several moments that are so nonsensical that it kept taking me out of the movie. And once you begin to look at this movie sideways the whole thing becomes funny.<br/><br/>The first instance that I'm speaking about involves Brendan Fraser's character. (By the way, there is no way I'm going to use the character names because you don't get to know them enough to ever remember them. At best this movie is a '100 most racially motivated moments' countdown). So Brendan is some kind of politician and he's speaking to his handlers about how to spin something that has happened to him. He makes a suggestion and within the same minute finds that it is a bad suggestion, and tells his underling to 'give himself a raise for that one' as if he wasn't the one who made the suggestion in the first place. No one does that. Bosses blame their workers for all kinds of mistakes that they make but not something that he just said within the same minute. I must have missed the next 3 lines of dialogue because I was thinking about how silly that was.<br/><br/>Later there is a scene with Matt Dillon and Loretta Divine. I've seen bits and pieces of it on TV shows as a promotional clip. In context, it's awful. Matt is being very friendly with her as he's hoping to find a solution with her to his father's medical/insurance problems. And then he suddenly turns on a dime and starts spouting his issues with Affirmative Action. I'm not even sure if he took a breath. Nobody does that. Ever.<br/><br/>Ludicrous and Larenz Tate. First off Larenz Tate is one of the better journeyman actors in this movie and the fact that he had to take a role where he basically plays sounding board meant solely to respond to Ludicrous, who up until now has been a rap artist, and to eventually be a bull's-eye, makes me sad. After being in the business for as long as he has he should have the Ludicrous role. But he didn't have the instant fanbase that Ludicrous has, I guess. So anyway, the ""China-man"" under the car. What was that? ""China-man"" sounds like a superhero who saves expensive dishware. That scene played as though it was meant to be comedic. Scary.<br/><br/>It all ended for me with the scene involving Don Cheadle and William Fichtner. Fichtner begins and ends a conversation with Don Cheadle with the question ""--expletive-- black people, huh?"" Yes, that expletive. And from there on in, I couldn't stop laughing. No one talks like that. Ever. I don't know how he got it out. He knows he'd never say that to a black person. And he knows he's never met anyone who would do that. And between the bookend questions he used the word ""black"" about 89 times. Ridiculous. One day in the future Don Cheadle is going to sit down and watch this movie and see how racist it really is. Not that it's showing us racist people, that it is racist. <br/><br/>So then wackiness ensues as Terrence Howard winds up in a car chase and does probably the stupidest thing any character in any movie has ever done, when he gets out of the car packing a gun and screaming insanities at a cop who is trying to stop him from getting shot. None of that makes any sense either but the moment when I fell out of my chair involves a Persian guy who hates buying doors and a little girl with a magic cloak. Remember in Pulp Fiction when God changed Coke to Pepsi? Well He's up to His Old Tricks again. Which I guess was an attempt to make the most predictable shooting in movie history unpredictable at the last minute. Awful.<br/><br/>The piece de resistance. When that women started running into the hospital screaming ""Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!"" I thought to myself ""oh please let 'China-man' be her husband, Larenz Tate being Don Cheadle's baby brother wasn't poetic enough"" Wouldn't you know it? The gods of cinema fulfilled my request. *tear* And the best part? Her name was Kim Lee. KIM LEE. Amazing.<br/><br/>This movie was bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. I did my best to give it a fair shake, but it wouldn't let me. It was unrealistic, the dialogue was atrocious, and a lot of the acting was sub par. And the final scenes were blatantly mooning the makers of Magnolia. Saying ""Look, we made a really bad version of your movie and we're going to prove how unoriginal we are by doing our own sad version of the ""Wise Up"" scene but to play off that we're not, our actors won't sing. :P And the best part is we attached racism to it, so it'll get all kinds of praise it doesn't deserve."" <br/><br/>As I said before at the very best it's a wacky comedy, at the very worst it's Best Picture as deemed by AMPAS. I don't know what they were thinking, if they were thinking. All I can do is laugh about the whole thing. But I do recommend that everyone see it, just to have their own opinion of it. I would never expect anyone to believe a review this one-sided, so please see it for yourself. But I promise you, these were my honest thoughts while watching this movie."
"jh2109","1","40","65","12 April 2006"," this won an award??
","I saw this movie a few weeks back and was very disappointed. I had seen all the nominated films for the BEST PICTURE academy award but had not seen CRASH because it wasn't in theaters very long and I missed it. AFter it became the Academy's BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR it was re-released to theaters and I went to see it right away.<br/><br/>What a disappointment! While I definitely agree that there is much discrimination in our world today, I felt that the script was poorly written because, in real life, people wouldn't say some of those things out loud. An example: after Sandra Bullock and her husband experience a car-jacking, the return home and immediately have all their house locks changed. Ms. Bullock's character starts screaming that she want to have all the locks changed again in the morning because she believes the hispanic man changing the locks is going to sell the keys of the locks that he just installed to his hispanic friends. Ms. bullock's character is an intelligent, sophisticated woman who, even if she did believe that it was necessary to have the locks changed again, she would whisper this to her husband OR express her thoughts after the hispanic man left her house. But, there's no way she would scream and yell that she wants the locks changed again because she doesn't trust the hispanic man who is currently in her house! The film is full of scenes that do not match reality. When the two black men are stopped after a chase and Matt Dillon's partner convinces his fellow officers to 'let them go with a warning', they never looked inside the car; they didn't even approach the vehicle. In real life, there's no way this would have happened and they would have seen the other occupants of the car.<br/><br/>So, this film might be a little entertaining but it says little because it does not match what would actually happen in the real world. 'Crash' is REAL trash!"

"MovieAddict2016","5","184","337","16 March 2006"," A Rusty Sledgehammer.
","Alas, here is a film mired by its excesses; one that comes so curiously close to moments of cinematic brilliance that all but embody the captivating possibilities of film-making, before disappointingly devolving backwards into a predictable, hammy and unbelievable preaching session.<br/><br/>Predictable because it follows standards  and doesn't dare to take enough risks. Hammy because it is stiff, simple and suspiciously empty. Unbelievable because a woman is saved from an exploding car on a jam-packed LA freeway and booked into a hospital and the cop who saved her goes back to work minutes afterward and, apparently, her husband is never even notified of her accident (and, if he had been, wouldn't he have been concerned with her welfare and perhaps at least left work early to attend to her?). Later that day he is involved in a high-speed chase; the conclusion of this incident wants to impress us with its irony and depth, but the problem is that there is none. Irony is not irony when it is commanded to be so; these characters do not realistically bounce off each other as they do in Akira Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" or Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction""  Paul Haggis' screenplay is contrived, and every time their paths cross, it isn't so much because they could cross (as in ""Pulp Fiction"")  it is because they must cross ways to service the furthering of the plot. It was irony in ""Fiction"" that the watch given to Butch was his father's saving grace and alternatively the cause of his own near-death. When the cop who sexually probed the woman ends up being her savior in ""Crash,"" it isn't irony. It's a gimmick.<br/><br/>The film wants to challenge us, spiritually, intellectually, and emotionally  it wants to be on the edge  and it even thinks it is challenging  but in all actuality, it's very light, and the Academy's choice of awarding it Best Picture substantiates this. ""Crash"" plays it safe, too often and frustratingly so. It wants to force us into second-guessing our mentality  but this only makes it feel heavy-handed and manipulative. It proposes that people today (especially in areas such as Los Angeles) are racist  and extends this theory by proving their apparent racism through actions and dialogue  but this only works as a tool for awareness, not resolution. It worked with ""Uncle Tom's Cabin""  it opened doors for new racial policies  but that was at a time when people's eyes needed to be open. It is now the twenty-first century, and bigots and racists know who they are and embrace this fact. We don't need a warning, anymore  we need a solution, and ""Crash"" provides no solid answers.<br/><br/>But it does have its moments  few and far between  that are stunning. (The rescue sequence, for example.) Matt Dillon gives a stellar performance, rich with depth and brimming with angst and hatred. Don Cheadle, in a similarly small role (from a cast of seemingly dozens), manages to convey exactly what the film needs in the form of a very human (and therefore very flawed) man from a shaky background who is struggling to maintain his image whilst dealing with a turbulent family situation  all of which comes to a breathtaking finale that doubles back on itself to the very beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Yet, for a movie with the gall to proclaim it is firmly rooted in humanity and wants to expose our inherent flaws, and wants to tell us we ""don't know"" who we really are, it does little to connect with its audience  even on the most basic level. The movie is simply too silly to take seriously. There are the aforementioned moments that actually start to amount to something, and begin to captivate  but are unfortunately dragged to a halting stop whenever Haggis tries to nail the point with a sledgehammer. An example of this: Everyone is constantly referring to racism in the script; one character is a conspiracy nut that thinks windows are put on buses to showcase the blacks ""too poor"" to afford anything other than public transportation. One character to the next is having an argument dealing with racial issues  a black car thief claiming all whites are racist; a white woman ranting about blacks and Latinos; a light-skinned black woman calling her husband racial epithets; it's just one after the next, over and over; Haggis didn't need to do this. We didn't need to have the woman's feelings explained to us, explicitly, after she is unjustly probed by the bigoted police officer. Her face says it all  it elicits fear, pain, hatred, and ultimately, deep upset over her husband's fragility and lack of manhood; the actions (or lack thereof) fulfilled by a man so utterly crippled by a fear of his own ethnicity that he denies himself the most basic human rights; peer respect at the cost of humility and debasement.<br/><br/>A better director would have stopped here. The face says it all. We don't need the rusty sledgehammer to drive the point in. Sometimes, all we need is the nail, and we can carry out the rest on our own.<br/><br/>Note: I give this film seven stars out of ten because some of its better moments outweigh the bad. I reserve giving it a higher rating due to the reasons above, but I do want to make it clear that some parts of the film were very good, and it's a real pity that Haggis was so inconsistent with the movie and couldn't have extended the better parts into a perfect whole."

","I hate to spoil the lovefest for CRASH but I have seen it twice and I don't understand how this is rated any higher than just mediocre. SPOILERS!!! I think I might have liked it a little better if Roger (Payola) Ebert had not called it the Best Picture of the Year. There is no question that CRASH had a few good moments but those can't compensate for the utter nonsense that contaminates this Grand Canyon-Magnolia rip off. First of all--I live in L.A. I find it hard to believe that writer/director Paul Haggis has ever been here. THere are race problems but it's not the only thing we think about 24/7. How convenient that all of Haggis' unconvincing characters do. I can't remember so many repulsive people in one film. The silly drunk wife who emasculates her husband because he didn't take a bullet to defend her honor when Matt Dillon fondles her was such a contrived nauseating character. What did she expect her husband to do? She didn't love the guy so their subsequent kiss & makeup was nauseating too. And Sandra Bullock needs to let her pathetic, shrinking career just slither away. Don't try drama sweetie. You stink. As for the blanks in the gun and the subsequent events. Give me a break!!!! The persian man shot a child in the back and he's home spouting gibberish about how his angel saved him. The SAINTLY locksmith had every reason to kill that man on the spot. But like MILLION DOLLAR BABY (another Haggis disaster), there are no consequences for people's criminal activity. Clint pulls the plug on Hillary and there's no investigation. He's free to open a diner while Morgan Freeman drones on with his insipid narration. Hillary is clocked in the head by a criminal act but no one gets in any trouble. But back to CRAP, I mean CRASH. How did Paul Haggis pitch this garbage? ""Let's make a movie about L.A. and its isolated population where everyone talks about race problems in a preachy unrealistic manner to each other and at each other. And everyone that appears to be a bad guy, will do something good. And everyone that appears to be a good guy will do something bad except the Hispanic locksmith--he's a virtual SAINT who just stares out the window. I could go on about the nonsense when the cops pull over the film director who is at the end of his rope because of the aforementioned fondling and a Tony Danza confrontation. Haggis knows nothing about the LAPD. That guy was a threatening menace and he would have likely been shot on the spot. And the idea that the other guy is hiding in the passenger seat with his gun is beyond laughable. Our cops would never let anyone leave like that without at least looking in the car--for their own safety. I don't have time to list the other hundred things that are wrong with this film."

Issues are isolated and blown out of proportion just to give an immediate emotional intensity. There is a lack of reality, intelligence, craft and creativity about the whole thing. And I found the racist, sex abusing cop's back story of being a dutiful son and then being a dramatic hero somewhat hard to swallow - after the event. Yeah, sure, at the time it felt like there was some significance there, but on reflection you see that it was just a dramatic scene in a Hollywood movie. And any suggestion that even a racist can also be nice to his mom is not worth making, except by racists to excuse and justify racist behaviour.<br/><br/>The confusions you feel at the time are the result of some blunt emotional exploitation by the movie makers.

"ThisGuyLovesMovies","1","13","18","6 July 2012"," Crass, soulless, and offensive to anything considered human
","Crash is a film about racism and race relations across the span of 2 days in Los Angeles. It stars Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Sasuke, Pinkie, Brain, John, Ringo, Twilight Sparkle...get the idea. It stars a lot of people who for lack of a better explanation; do nothing but shout racial slurs and accusations centered around racial profiling.<br/><br/>It starts with a car crash involving detective Don Cheadle and his partner a Mexican lady whose name escapes me, and an Asian lady whose name I don't believe was given. The two exit the car with Cheadle going to check out a recent crime scene that just so HAPPENED to be nearby, while his partner decides to berate the ladies poor English by saying ""brake light"" with the ls and rs switched. Because....well this pretty much happens throughout the movie you might as well TRY getting used to it.<br/><br/>Cut back to yesterday and were introduced to a Persian shop owner, Farhad, and his daughter trying to buy a gun. Farhad gets mad at the man for some plot contrived reason which he responds with 9/11 and terrorist slur. This pawn owner is one of the many MANY characters you will only remember as being as racist as a human possibly can.<br/><br/>Later that night we see Ludicrous and Larenz Tate walking out of a coffee shop, Luda being unsatisfied with his service claiming racism. (BTW Ludicrous does this CONSTANTLY during the film) They see D.A Brendan Fraser and pampered wife Sandra Bullock turn away to their car. Ludicrous accuses Sandra of turning away in blind fear thinking she would be carjacked. I thought ""Huh, your kinda right. I think she did.""....up until the two carjack the Fraser and Bullock. So he brought up a racist query and then in a massive act of hypocrisy DID THE EXACT SAME THING HE ACCUSED BULLOCK OF BEING AFRAID OF!!!. Now i'm a person who thinks just because someone is a hypocrite doesn't make them wrong in what they're saying but their message is muddled incredibly when they ARE being a hypocrite.<br/><br/>Back at the DAs house, locksmith Michael Pena is changing the lock to the house and Sandra complains about having ""one of their gang members"" is changing the locks because......she's racist....very racist. 12 minutes into the film and we are still introducing characters, we see Officers Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe going on their patrol hearing about the carjacking; seeing a similar black Navigator and with Matt Dillon again being a racist they pull over Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. There under the pretense of a pat-down Dillon molests Thandie Newton....why?! WHY?! I wish i could answer that.<br/><br/>Crash is a film that I completely and utterly despise. The whole movie is nothing more than racial slurs for no reason whatsoever. It has no redeemable characters and is full of an unbelievable amount of pretentious god-awful writing. It believes its saying something powerful but it just comes off as pretentious. Along with irredeemable characters, the film also has useless and just plain strange plot elements. There's an investigation involving Don Cheadle and his partner that seems unnecessary to the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>There are 2 plot points that are both stupid and make no sense the most. At one moment Ludicrous accidentally runs over an Asian man standing next to his van. After ""a change of conscience"" he decides to take the van finding a good 20 chained, dirty, and most likely homeless Asian people in the back. Why were there a bunch of Asian people in the back of the van? Why didn't the Asian people not notice nothing was happening? The van was sitting in that same spot for a good day in a half. Ludicrous releases them in the middle of Chinatown. This is shown as a act of good will and possible redemption, but if you release a bunch of chained homeless people into the streets: you are getting arrested. No questions. Then there is a plot line of Farhad getting upset at Michael Pena because.....the plot called for it, which ultimately results in him pointing a gun at his face. Pena's 5 year old daughter; after her father tells her a story of his ""invisible impenetrable cloak"" that i guess is called ""foreshadowing"", leaps into his arms just as the gun goes off...but everyone is unharmed. It turns out that the gun just so HAPPENED to have blank bullets. And I guess it just so HAPPENED that Farhad had a change of heart after that. So an entirely irredeemable person is ""redeemed"" through a so called act of God or coincidence. But this character isn't redeemed because it's an act of plot contrivance. Seriously, what the hell kind of writing is this?<br/><br/>How can a movie like Crash get made. Or hell, even green lit?!How can a movie like Crash get such critical backing? How could a movie like Crash be Best Picture, when literally EVERY OTHER CHOICE IS BETTER?!?! Its a horribly written, horribly contrived, horribly pretentious piece of cinematic trash; that I wish never to experience again."

","This was a pretty bad film. To be fair, I thought it was better than the one-star rating I gave it here, but I felt morally compelled to vote it thusly just to counter-balance the staggeringly incomprehensible positive votes that it received. That this mess won Best Picture is horrific.<br/><br/>Indeed, its winning of Best Picture was the only reason I saw it. I had low expectations going in, expecting it to be heavy-handed and preachy; perhaps for this reason I wasn't so offended by its copious heavy-handed preachiness. It managed to hold my attention for the most part. But there is an awful lot to throw darts at here. I will confine myself to what I consider the most egregious problem, which was the contrived nature of the whole thing.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, most of the characters just flat-out don't work. That is to say, the end up doing or saying things that make NO SENSE within the context of what we already know about the character. This is because the relentless point-of-view of this film is supposed to be that EVERYBODY is both good and bad, so that every racist character has to be shown to have a good side, and every good character has to be shown to have a racist side. But with dogged determination to shove every character through this cookie-cutter, very little effort is expended to actually *develop* the characters in such a way as to make both sides of them seem credible. So we get such out-of-the-blue nonsense as having the otherwise-perfectly-unracist detective spout a bit of anti-Hispanic bigotry at the woman he's sleeping with-- with nothing before or after to make that make sense. Same with the ""good cop"" guy, who has very consistently shown to abhor racism and be a good guy-- until suddenly he gets all worked up over nothing and shoots the black guy for nothing. And it works the other way. The bitchy racist DA's wife, in the end *preposterously* decides that the Hispanic maid is actually her best friend??? With *hugs*?? You don't even get the sense that she hugs her *husband* with that much affection. How did *that* fit the character??? The answer, in all cases, is that it DOESN'T fit the character; the movie makers simply felt that all they had to do to show that even good people are racists is to show us good people and then have them, for no reason, act racist for a little while. It's like trying to prove a point by simply asserting it over and over again, rather than bringing in any logic or facts to the argument. I could make a great film demonstrating how, really, EVERYBODY likes strawberry ice cream, by simply showing a lot of people eating and enjoying strawberry ice cream-- even those who claim they don't like strawberry ice cream. But that would hardly convince anyone of my premise, would it?"
"jimstarkcal","Null","32","51","26 September 2005"," Way to taint a good Cronenberg title
","This is not a particularly subtle movie. And I'm not such a particularly big fan of subtlety either. Of course, when the lack of subtlety is not a choice but feels more like lack of confidence, lack of experience in envisioning a movie or even plain lack of smarts, it begins to annoy me. When Crash started, I was fairly interested on it. About 20 minutes in, Paul Haggis had killed any sort of appeal his so-called characters and so-called film-making resources could've had, and I was bored. An hour later, it had become unintentional comedy. Fortunately, I was with a friend, so we got a chance to have some whispered laughs.<br/><br/>Haggis is telling a choral story driving about twenty so-called characters through the streets of L.A. While I frankly don't know much about the movies of people like Altman and P.T. Anderson (I've only seen M.A.S.H., Gosford Park and Punch-drunk love), I can see why people bring up their names while talking about Crash. In particular, there's a way of using music tracks and editing to connect different characters, dramatic situations and ways of living that's a desperate effort to resemble those more talented directors.<br/><br/>The movie shoves these characters around, telling us snippets of their lives, which are 24/7 dedicated to discriminating people from other races or discussing their views on race. There's a black cop played by Don Cheadle, a white politician played by Brendan Fraser with a white and very very racist wife played by Sandra Bullock, a proud-to-be-black black sitcom actress played by Thandie Newton and some other people. All in all, as I said, they're about twenty, I think, and they keep bumping into each other so often that I think none else lives on L.A. apart from them. And they all really really hate each other.<br/><br/>What does it all amount to? Well, at the beginning of the movie, Don Cheadle (who does the best acting in the movie and has the only remotely interesting role, everything has to be said) says ""In LA, nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something"". I think that pretty much summarizes everything. Well, that, and the comfortable and supposedly meaningful dogma that everyone has a good and a bad side. So, every character in the movie will do one very very nasty thing and one very very good thing. A cop who's offended by the racism of his partner will shoot a black dude because he assumes he's about to pull a gun. The racist cop that's not above pulling a wealthy black/black couple, probably thinking it's a black/white one (Thandie Newton has kinda light skin) will be a good boy to his father who can't pee and save the same woman's life later. It's all really really contrived, really really reiterative and really really lame. On the positive side, Crash is shorter than you probably expect it to be. If you'd like to see a social drama done wrong, just for the fun of it, it almost works as a textbook example and you don't waste much time.<br/><br/>Let me get this straight, before I get accused of something myself  I get what Crash is trying to say, that racism on all of its forms still survives in modern society, concealed as it might be, and that everyone, even not all that bad people, might be guilty of it at any given time. I even agree with it. I just think Haggis did such a poor job of conveying his message that it might even be interpreted wrong. Some of the more supposedly affecting or tough scenes in the movie are so clumsily made and lack so many different kinds of build-up and motivation that you'll pretty likely laugh your ass off at them. Osama guy shooting the little girl with fake bullets and the staring at the gun for a really really long time? Sandra Bullock falling through the stairs? THAI SLAVES COMING OUT OF A TRUCK? Come on, man. It's funnier than every chapter in the last 5 Simpsons seasons."

There was Matt Dillon, who played a policeman who felt a woman up during a traffic stop, and somehow getting her HUSBAND to apologize. And, later, he insulted a woman who wouldn't process an insurance claim the way he wanted by telling her that there had to have been five white men more qualified for her position than she was.

For the record I'm not some inbred hick that hates any movie that deals with racism. I respect every movie that dealt with racism prior to this movie.<br/><br/>Crash received all its hype because the Academy Awards did not want to see Brokeback Mountain. There I said it. Its no secret that the Academy Awards are paid bandwagoneers. If there is money involved they will oversell any movie to death. If you recognize that fact and still give them the benefit of the doubt then you need to get your head checked.<br/><br/>Crash plays like a glorified, PC to the extreme, TV movie on race. The main thing that made better movies on race relations in the past great is that the characters in them are realistic. Look at Mississippi Burning and American History X. Are the people in those movies realistic? Yes. Now look at Crash. Are the people in Crash realistic? Of course not. These people talk about race 100% of the time. I'm sorry but even the most of hardcore racist will not talk about race 100% of the time nor would they do the stupid things the people in this movie do.<br/><br/>With the exception of Ryan Phillipe, Terrence Howard and Michael Pena, the performances were laughable and weak. Matt Dillon should have been perfect as the racist cop John Ryan but to say he was unbelievable is putting it nicely. When he groped Thandie Newton's butt in a traffic stop I had to hold back laughter. I was waiting for her to pass gas to give this scene the hilarity it deserves. Did the writers think that was supposed to be an effective scene? Please. Show him zapping her with a taser gun or beating her down and then you would have a more accurate description of what a racist cop would do and a more effective scene. Sandra Bullock was equally unbelievable in her role. I laughed my a** off when she fell down those flights of stairs.<br/><br/>Ludicrous's character fails big time because we all know he has no depth to his character. Just listen to his albums. Larenz Tate is slumming in his performance and Don Cheadle phones it in. The writing stinks too because as I said earlier the people are unrealistic as well as the situations they are in. I cant believe for one second that John Ryan would rescue Christine from a car accident after he fondled her buttocks in front of her husband and neither should you.<br/><br/>The thing that sad the most about Crash is that after its done you are left wondering what the hell you just watched. The best movies on race leave the viewer with something they will never forget. This movie leaves you with nothing but unitentional humor. There are better movies out there that deserve a spot on the top 250. Why is this movie still here?<br/><br/>Better movies on racism: Magnolia, America History X, Do The Right Thing, Bamboozled, and Mississippi Burning. Hell I'll even take Higher Learning any day over this garbage movie."

","In Crash, Director Paul Haggis goes Altmanesque with this garbled attempt to discuss bigotry in contemporary LA. Overall it lacks Altman's energy and offers up gross cliché characters instead of quirky originals. Crash begins to go into its spin right after Detective Weathers (Don Cheadle) sums up the ""City of Angels"" populace in the first line of the film. ""In LA nobody touches you. We're all behind glass and metal. Sometimes I think we crash into each other just so we can feel something."" We are then introduced to a full cast of impatient, ill tempered Angelinos of all stripe and persuasion connected in some way to make life miserable for each other. There's the bigoted cop, the successful ""Uncle Tom"" black, the Asian trafficking in human cargo, the hard working Latino, the misunderstood Persian and gang banger of principle. It's LA as a microcosm of the world, Hollywood style.<br/><br/>The enemy is ourselves seems to be the message as Crash's one dimensional characters snarl at each other from start to finish with occasional moments of insight and exposed vulnerability as they spend scene after scene reciting well worn bigoted archaisms that have been around for decades. When Haggis runs out of these he goes into music video mode with a solemn track playing over a montage of Crash's hapless citizens looking dutifully glum.<br/><br/>Serious as it attempts to be Crash is a rather vapid message picture with a couple of incendiary scenes connected by preposterous coincidence that patronizes its token cast when its not busy spitting stilted racist venom. It's a five car pile-up."

"kaz1488","3","17","25","25 November 2005"," Definitely a Lethal Crash
","Okay, lets all get a few things straight about this movie. This movie was good to people who usually watch *beep* obvious films that have absolutely no original arc to them. People would come out saying, ""Wow, I can't believe how much this film connected!"". Give me a break. If you want true art that's like this watch Magnolia. Here are my problems with Crash... <br/><br/>1. The character development was terrible. Yeah, bad things are happening to these characters, but did they do anything that should make me feel for them and be able to identify? No. I've got Matt Dillon the racist, Terrence Howard the director who speeds away from the police for no logical reason, Brandon Fraiser who is the most pussy whipped man on earth. Sandra Bullock who's a one note bitch the whole time. Where do I look to find sympathy for these people? I mean when Bullock hugs her maid at the end, who gives a *beep* She's in so much pain from falling down the stairs and has a realization. ""Oh no, I'm a bitch. Now let me embrace the first person who puts up with me...even though they work for my money..."". None of these people were believable either. Cheadle's mother would have NEVER asked for his little brother to come home in real life. Real life junkies don't give a *beep* about that stuff because they're too fried after all the drugs they've done. They don't have any real feelings left. And come on with the Iranian family. The father is an *beep* and I'm supposed to care that he thinks god came down and stopped his bullet from killing some little girl. It's a blank, it's not hard to figure out, especially since your daughter left the box in your store that says in huge letters BLANKS on it. *beep* morons. <br/><br/>2. The extreme push that everyone HAS TO BE racist against someone. Just take a concept and jam it down my throat why don't you? The first thing is about how Asians can't drive. Then there's the Osama comment in the gun store. Then the black car jacker who hates people who think black people jack cars. This whole thing is just showing how stereotypical you have to be to get people to notice you. <br/><br/>3. The characters time on screen were so short lived that I couldn't give a *beep* what happened to them. <br/><br/>4. The writing style was very contrived and not believable. *phone rings* *Cheadle picks it up* ""I can't talk now mom, I'm having sex with a Mexican."" *Cheadle hangs up*. Wow lets not try and stick a racial comment in there to cause a moment of interracial spat between lovers... <br/><br/>5. The direction was self-absorbed and didn't reach out to the audience. Haggis just wanted people to think he's a great director with his exploding cars and people barely escaping and showing their faces full of indifference after they were so hateful. It's RIDICULOUS. <br/><br/>Whomever thinks this film is one of the best films they've ever seen needs to watch more than four movies. I would have to watch only Gigli, Waterworld, and How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days to call this the best film I'd ever seen. This film is for the large audience of people who don't know anything about film. People who think a film is good when the acting is okay across the board and the topic is racism and OH MY LORDDD things actually connect in the end! It's like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia...but with down syndrome! Matt Dillon and Terrernce Howard saved this film. They were both outstanding...as usual. Haggis should get on his knees and thank them for saving his career because without them he'd be stuck with movie called, ""The Acting is Terrible and Everything is a Stereotype."" Instead it's just, ""Everything is a stereotype."" <br/><br/>I hope you think about this next time you watch the film instead of thinking about how cool and unconventional you are for liking a film that's not starring the usual suspects in the romantic comedy scene."
"gridwerk-1","1","26","41","14 November 2005"," This movie was complete junk.
","The film opens with two young black guys who are walking down the street and remarking about how America stereotypes them as criminals and how unfair it is that the world operates that way but just as you are starting to see their point of view they steal an SUV at gunpoint. So now you think the whole speech was satire and if Haggis had written it that way I might have enjoyed the movie a slight bit but instead he manages to make their feelings a constant righteous theme and they are portrayed as the victims. <br/><br/>Matt Dillon is, of course, a racist L.A. cop who dabbles in rape- cause all cops are like that, right? And it's important for Hollywood to perpetuate this image for some reason. Dillon's character has a rookie partner who is not a racist at the start but rather an idealist who doesn't want to be a racist but finds that he cant fight his inherent white programming and, in a bigoted misunderstanding, shoots a black hitchhiker (who is actually the gun-toting carjacker- or ""victim of oppressive white America"" and the kid brother of Don Cheadles character).<br/><br/>Fraser plays the idiotic DA whose character apparently just learned black people were on the planet and asks stupid questions to his adviser referring to them as ""those people""; Bullock is a pill-popping débutante who lords over her Mexican servants like a slave owner and plays the racist to the locksmith who can't understand her fear even though he is dressed and tattooed like a prison inmate and she just got robbed at gunpoint. Of course she still isn't meant to have any sympathy felt for her because she's apparently evil and deserved it, as the movie later reminds you when a fall down the stairs teaches her that racism is wrong. (Huh? You gotta be kidding me, people paid to see this tripe?) <br/><br/>The only other white people in the movie are bumbling, heartless cops and a gun store owner who is (of course) a faucet of racist epitaphs. The last character of note is the gun-mad Arab store owner who is stereotypically nuts and tries to shoot the Mexican locksmith for no other reason than Haggis needed to further vilify another race du jour and with the war going on why not pick the Arabs? <br/><br/>Now, at this point you are wondering who the hero of the movie is. It could be the black Hollywood director who gets pulled over and his wife raped by the racist LAPD or the black HMO representative who gets to enjoy her revenge on all white people by making the Dillon characters father suffer at the hands of prostate cancer- she is also made to be vindicated by the mood of the movie. <br/><br/>I expected better by producer Don Cheadle, a representative of Hollywood I had great respect for but am not surprised by Haggis' inability to capitalize on an opportunity to succeed with a well assembled cast. That is his signature. <br/><br/>My Final Verdict: Don't watch this movie, don't rent it, don't use it to prop your window open. Its crash all right- crash and burn."

","Zero Stars (out of 4) By Aaron Dumont<br/><br/>Among the countless slew and turgid veil of the garishly safe, self-satisfied PC-indulgence fests released within the past years, Crash, a monstrous, clunky culmination of the very, very worst of Altman-wannabes and the most tired and bored of overused conventions, stood among the most confoundingly successful of them all.<br/><br/>In Paul Haggis' Crash, an array of characters live in Los Angeles. Their lives intersect with each other, and they go through an unbearably straightforward series of melodramatic incidents, mainly due to a car crash. The movie as a whole is executed in a pretend-mythical style—astoundingly overused, absurdly glossy spiritual symbols, artificial, indulgent melodramatics instead of genuine humanity and insight. The characters are portrayed as either victimized angels or bigoted demons that repent to become victimized angels.<br/><br/>The movie itself is so clean, manufactured and mass-produced that it feels like a plastic shell. The characters are nothing more than pop abstractions that begin with little-to-none dimension and, paradoxically, lose dimension as they progress. The social and cultural tidbits portrayed here are illustrated in straight, bold, plain lines. Crash's formality feels so out-of-place, so uncomfortable, that even with any redeeming values, it's impossible to forgive.<br/><br/>Now, technically speaking, it's not the worst movie ever made, and it's not the worst of the decade, either. In fact, based on technical guidelines, it's not even the worst movie of 2005. However, in applying the Joe Queenan theory-—that the truly worst movies ever made are the ones that shot for the moon and offshooted; the movies that bugged you; the ones that stuck with you for a long, long time - Crash is really the worst of its year. It is also one of the worst of the decade (only The Village, The Passion of the Christ, Hancock and a few others fare worse). It's wildly visionary approach simply felt like a mammoth-scale failure. It got to me. It bugged me. The whimper this movie got out of such a fruitful idea was simply sad to watch. Any faint merits or respectable attempts for greatness made it seem all the more heartbreakingly terrible—this pretentious, cheap disaster seems so wasted.<br/><br/>The movie is a deformed pastiche of political blindness, soullessness and emptiness. It appeared to me as a lifeless, rushed scam - a movie that feeds off mass consensus of opinion without trying anything revolutionary itself.<br/><br/>Crash is a movie that gives itself the undeserved assertion that it really is revolutionary-—yet it pathetically follows the crowd while it obnoxiously assumes it is leading. This movie could have been so much more—something modest, something in-touch, something relevant--or, at the very least, something tolerable."

"s_cadzow","3","22","34","10 January 2006"," 2005's Biggest Disappointment.
","Crash is a film that is trying much too hard to try and show a part of society that is already painfully obvious. Stop and think... you are in the middle of a public place and someone shouts ""HEY! RACISM EXISTS! AND I'M NOT GOING TO DO A THING ABOUT IT!"" Now imagine how you would feel? What is such an exclamation worth if there is no resolve offered with it? Crash is a collection, for the most part, of absurdly shallow stories with overly clichéd characters. <br/><br/>With the exception of the moving performance delivered by Michael Pena, the acting is significantly flawed and irritating. Most importantly, is the complete lack of depth and progression of the majority of the cast. The words ""cliche"" and ""redundant"" can not be used enough to describe the racial representations in Crash. <br/><br/>The White's (Bullock, Dillon, and Fraser) are incredibly dull, phobic, uneducated and stereotypically shown as the ""we are the dominant race,"" because of course Crash would not be much of a movie without a ""bad guy."" <br/><br/>Next, we have the African Americans, which is an almost embarrassing and degrading representation. We have a ""social intellect"" who as he steals cars, continues on his ""the white man is keeping the black man down"" rants. The blacks also have the over the edge ""black pride"" role of Thandie Newton. While breaking the law and then crying a string of ""this is because i'm black"" proclamations, you can't help but wonder WHY this character was put in this movie, did Paul Haggis WANT us to dislike the blacks in Crash? <br/><br/>The thing i can't understand the most about Crash, is the acclaim that Terrence Howard received for his role. After the blatant ignorance of his wife Newton's character, Howard makes a split from her and carries on the majority of the film conflicted about himself as a man, an African American and a husband. This was the only shot Crash really had at character development, and it failed. Newton's character evolves NONE from start to finish in Crash, and Terrence's character, with whatever revelation he quietly achieves in his own mind, is never shared with the audience, thus making his return to Newton at the end a total waste of whatever change we thought he was building up to. <br/><br/>Another huge disappointment of Crash was the complete irrelevance of the supporting cast (Cheadle, Esposito, Phillippe). There is not a scene involving these characters that furthers the story or enhances the film in any way without just adding to the ever accumulating pile of redundancy. If the complete failure of character structure and advancing plot is not enough to be making you want to hit the stop button, then perhaps the complete lack of innovative camera work is. From the opening scene to the closing credits, Crash fails to deliver anything innovative to film, technique, or the ever pressing battle on racism. <br/><br/>Do we as a society have a serious problem with racism? Yes. Are we as a society aware of this? Yes. Do we need a film that presents no resolution nor challenges the idea of racism to try and drive the point home? Most certainly not. I was thoroughly irritated and disappointed with this film."

","If you are interested in seeing the usual stereotypes peddled to the extreme then this may be a good film for you. Otherwise it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of resolving the issues of all the characters - maybe I'm old-fashioned but I like to see characters at least find some resonance in their moral fibre by the end of the film, i.e. character arc. Was it me or did this film become 'jammed' full of bitter, angry, uncompromising,stubborn, narrowly-focused rugged individuals who only know that revenge and saving your own hide is the best solution of the times. Its very difficult to feel any compassion for these one-dimensional characters. I refuse to agree with this film's attempt to universally sell this idea that it's cathartic to scream, bitch, steal and generally hate the world when a stronger message could have been sent with this premise and with characters with bigger minds and fewer things to just 'say'.<br/><br/>I found it universally verbose and stuck on the non-transcending solution of violence and remaining at the status-quo. The characters and the story did not 'move' me. I guess it did not meet my expectations and I find it quite surprising that it was rated so high. People who like this film probably aren't in touch with the real world - its not all that depressing, deprived and chaotic. This film felt like a grainy little piece of gum stuck to the bottom of my shoe.<br/><br/>Overrated and completely uninspiring. Powerfully annoying."

","When you notice that Frank Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' is the film playing at Westwood's Regent theatre in one of the movie's first scene, you should know you're in for trouble. CRASH is a ""well intentioned"" film and I suspect the IMDb reader base that is praising it does so because of the script's attempts to try and reveal that there is more beneath the surface of human's apparent prejudice. Unfortunately, as a critic for the New York Times explained it, this film shows that there is only the absolute opposite. The characters in this film have no subtlety and no range of human emotions. There isn't a single real character in this movie, only contrivances that are constructed around a writer's technical skill at creating unsupported ironic events (as we see so many times when the introductory actions of a character become their opposite). The movie, basically, has neither a sense or reality nor a skillful sense of artifice. It is, ultimately, a mess with good production values. While I would normally just dismiss it and not write a comment, I am somewhat frightened by the number of rave reviews that this film is receiving in IMDb. I can't understand this. All I can assume is that the general audience is subject to such garbage that anything with a little bit of reversal in the characters comes as a shocking delight that is worthy of praise."

","There were a few exciting, tense vignettes between the characters of ""Crash"" but there were also some tendentious, heavy, hackneyed things that really stood out: Don Cheadle's voice-over, ostensibly deep (the voice of conscience in the film), Sandra Bullock's hugging her maid towards the end of the film and confessing to her that she (the maid) was actually her best friend, the really quite sappy Latino whose gets killed when trying to save her father (the ""red-cloak"" piece of malarkey), the condescending treatment of Asians (especially the atrociously accented Korean woman at the beginning), the long sequence involving Brendan Fraser in the courtroom (it didn't seem relevant and was slow, the Terrence Howard/Thandie Newton confrontation (a lot of sparks but not really that compelling except for the melodrama), and so on. That the Matt Dillon turns to the Ryan Phillipe character when they break-up as a police team, ""You think you know who you are but you don't have any idea, et. al."" is gratuitous. Like so many lines in this film, it comes out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Not subtle, not a work of art, but plenty of adrenaline and action around a hot-button issue. Which is probably why less sophisticated, younger movie-goers (I just can hear them saying ""Really cool, man, it'so SO-O deep"") seem to have gone for this film. Most critics apart from Ebert and a few others were very lukewarm, if not downright very critical about this film. Believe me, it doesn't hold a candle and is definitely not in the same category as ""La Strada,"" ""Gosford Park,""...or last year's exceptional ""Brokeback Mountain."" Three much better films with superior screenplays/plot-lines, and character development are ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Mullholland Drive,"" and ""Chinatown."" <br/><br/>Dialogue clichés, lots of high-speed car chases, clichéd-characters, lots of movie-stars doing uncharacteristically small turns, and Hollywood's favorite liberal subject matter (racism) are a recipe for Hollywood acclaim and middlebrow American audience approval. This film made only about 33% of its receipts from outside the U.S., a pretty weak showing. ""Brokeback Mountain""'s receipts overseas accounted for more than its domestic grosses.<br/><br/>That it won the Oscar is NOT that surprising when such middling fare as ""Beautiful Mind"" (pure schlock except for Russell Crowe's acting). ""Gladiator,"" ""Braveheart,"" etc. won.<br/><br/>(This is definitely the last time I'll even pay attention to the Oscars).<br/><br/>At ""Crash"" at least breaks the stereotype that all African-Americans are an unfairly persecuted, noble minority."

We have a police officer sexually assaulting a black woman, his indignant partner, a pair of carjacking black youths, an Asian man hit by a car, a Persian convenience store owner (how original), and a prosperous white couple who turn out to be rather unsavoury. The movie baits you with these characters, making you wonder what will happen to them and how their behaviour will be repaid.<br/><br/>Then we get to the second half. While the beginning of the movie nicely sets up some scenarios that make us curious, the second half hinges on consequences that are too unbelievable to swallow. The sex offender cops saves the woman he molested. The WASP woman who is ""always angry"" falls down stairs and must be cared for by her Hispanic maid. The good black policeman purgers himself in order to cover up a warrant out for his brother, who coincidentally is shot to death by the idealistic young cop who stood up for his principles. The poor Asian man, hit by a car, turns out to be trafficking Cambodian nationals for a Triad gang. And the car thief finds the van full of Cambodians, steals it, and ends up setting them free after being offered roughly $5000 for them. Right...<br/><br/>***Spoilers End*** Okay, we get it. Good people do bad things, and bad people do good things. Nice premise, but did we need to be hit over the head with it over and over again? And couldn't the writer find less coincidental means of revealing the moral of the story? Perhaps the writer should have spent less time attempting to write a Pulp Fiction morality tale and more time fleshing out his characters in order to make them more believable and less one-sided. Because in the end, no matter what they do, they can still be described in simplistic terms. Racist. Car Thief. WASP. Idealistic Cop. Family Man. And so on."

Films which are no less contrived, no less fictional, no less fantasy, yet dare us to suspend disbelief because they are meant to be perceived as some sort of Brechtian reality. As if a pastiche of LA; the very sediment of America as if it were reduced in some great crucible,is placed before us and we as audience, can participate in seeing (in almost a voyeuristic fashion) what REALLY GOES ON-- WHAT RACE RELATIONS IN America ARE REALLY ALL ABOUT.<br/><br/>No, I am not some right wing nut. Far FAR from it. But this movie is so surreptitious in the manner in which it portrays pure fiction as flesh and blood fact. It is, as I stated in the title, almost propagandistic.

But with ""Crash"" we get to be force fed Paul Haggis' world-view and we are meant to be shocked and disturbed at the cruel, unfair world we live in.

It's a film to be viewed from the comfortable suburbs, with a two-car garage and a hefty mortgage. It is from there that you can really feel the angst and oppression of those who are dispossessed. From that perspective you can be disturbed and see the hardness of this film. From there you can see it all really is true.

Unfortunately, it begins with the first scene, where two carjackers are talking about how they're being viewed as- well, crooks.<br/><br/>The double irony is not what I take issue with. What's incredibly stupid - so stupid that even punk-ass carjackers wouldn't do this -is that they hung out in a diner for an hour in the same neighborhood before committing a felony crime. Thus, collecting dozens of witnesses who'd be able to identify them. I'm no carjacker, but a tiny bit of common sense says you don't want to be noticed before committing a crime. But there it is, because it advances the ""story"". And Big Statement. Once you have something so incredibly stupid jammed into a script that purports to be ""real"" JUST to make your Big Point - folks, that's called hackwork.<br/><br/>Or how about one of the closing scenes, where the director stares at a burning car, then calls his wife on the cell phone? Gee, wasn't it as few hours earlier that his wife nearly got blown to bits in a explosive car wreck? So, does loving husband rush home? No. Guess it made a deeper scene this other way, the way it was shot. Oh, okay. Big Statement. C'MON!! <br/><br/>I mean <br/><br/>C'MON!!! <br/><br/>Too stupid to accept.

The writer had an agenda, rather than any sense of LA's reality and real vibe--and worse, the writer seemed to have no damn common sense whatsoever. Well-meaning try, but not a classic, not even all that good.<br/><br/>Industry folks can sometimes be too much like dogs licking their lowers. It's about LA, it purports itself to be deep and meaningful. Naturally, the Industry loves it, because they want to seem deep and meaningful, too. It's self-important hackwork tripe like this that gives LA its shallow reputation. While it has its moments and some good performances, it deserves to be buried in the discount bin, not lauded.<br/><br/>Disappointment."

One review, which I wholeheartedly agree with, comes from Peter Debruge of the Miami Herald. He writes 'Contrived, obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've confronted the problem of racism head-on.' This was exactly how I felt while watching this movie.

","This film is one of the most laughable attempts to make something similar to a movie I have ever watched. False, fake, and full of stereotypes. This film may have been relevant in 1992, but now it looks and feels really dated. I felt I had seen this film before. This subject has been dealt with in a much more genuine way by other directors. The fact that this film won the best film Oscar this year shows that there really is something wrong with the way the Academy votes. The other nominated films deserved the Oscar for many reasons.

","Wow...what a load of...<br/><br/>My husband, to my shame, purchased the DVD based on the hype and all the Oscar hoopla. I read a few reviews before hand, and was wary. Still, I really wanted to like this movie. As I watched it, it became really hard to do.<br/><br/>I tried on a cinematic, technical level, looking for great camera work, settings, lighting...nope, nothing impressed me. I tried to like it for its proposed ""edgy"" dialog, and its ""daring"", ""noble"", ""eye-opening"" coverage of racism. None of that came across in the movie. It was written almost from the perspective of someone who hasn't experienced tense situations, let alone racism.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, and Terrance Howard did the best they could with their roles. However, ANYONE could have played any of the characters, and it would have been the same movie.<br/><br/>The music was forgettable. The story is mostly an urban folk tale, but there is no urban-styled music. The music is too clean.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was mostly a ""C"" movie, not at all worthy of the awards it received. There is maybe only one truly intense scene...but it is really a cliché in disguise. Just like the rest of the film.<br/><br/>If you have to, absolutely have to watch this, rent it. Or wait for Crash: The Musical.<br/><br/>As an aside: The jacket of the DVD has a picture of Jennifer Esposito on the back...SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STORY. Her character was non-existent, accept for seeing her under Don Cheadle for two seconds. If they were going to put a screen shot of Esposito on the DVD jacket, they could have mentioned Sandra Bullock's collagen bloated upper lip in the end credit thank-you's, since both Esposito and the lip served the same purpose, whatever purpose that was."
"Brakathor","2","15","22","7 May 2008"," A Stereotypical Insult To The Viewers About Racism
","This is without a doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen in it's contrived preachy message and fabricated plot situations. There is absolutely no subtlety to it whatsoever. Almost every conversation in this movie is a direct racial reference.<br/><br/>On top of everything it has an angry and rude Asian woman with a faked Asian accent who crashes into another woman's car, and who says ""blake"" instead of brake, which is the worst extent of this films crass stereotypical way of presenting racial tension. This movie tries to tell us that white women cower in fear when they see black men on the street in a white neighbourhood. It has black men complaining about being treated as thieves and criminals directly before they steal a persons van. How ironic, thanks for clubbing us over the head with it. It has policemen pulling over a black couple for no charge after being radio called to stop a completely different car, then they pervertedly frisk the man's wife, and then let them go when the husband apologises, as if policemen have nothing better to do than show how racist they are and risk their reputation over absolutely no crime committed. It has a racist cop telling his rookie partner ""you may think you have morals but you will find out you have no idea who you are"" as if being a cop predisposes you to be racist.<br/><br/>Later in the movie, the same woman is trapped in a burning vehicle, and the first person who arrives to help her is the same officer who frisked her. She fears his help when he is the only person to save her. How... poetic? I would be surprised if that situation happened even once in north America. Later there is an angry Iranian man who tracks down a Hispanic locksmith, demanding he pay him for ""not properly fixing the lock"" holding a gun to his head, when really he was too stupid to understand the locksmith when he said that the door itself needed replacement. That is as ridiculous as me going to Bell phone company with a gun demanding for a refund on the phone I was returning for which they were giving me a hard time, and the Iranian man is a small business owner with a family, and he would throw his life away for that? At this point the Hispanic mans daughter runs out of the house, and jumps up in her fathers arms just as the Iranian man shoots at point plank range, but she is not shot because her father gave her an invisible bullet proof blanket that a fairy gave to him ""the actual explanation given by the movie"" If this scene does not seem contrived and seems like awesome poignant poetry, then you will like this movie. If not, There are many other such ridiculous scenes, with roughly 5 groups of unconnected people all bumping into each other supposedly at random as plot development, which in addition to the heavy handed preachy dialogue, will annoy you.<br/><br/>Everything about this films message is so ""in your face"" that it doesn't challenge the mind of the viewer whatsoever or leave anything up to perception or opinion. Every single scene is clearly GOOD or BAD. The answer is always ""Yes... That is racist"" there is no context shown behind the racism and no grey line between actual racism and perceived racism. What made directors like Sam Peckinpah great was his ability to invoke emotions and to deal with strong subjects without needing to blatantly state them a dozen times over in his films.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that has a big effect on people who deeply want to feel empathy regardless of realism and plausibility. This movie functions only as an allegory, and the plot situations are so unrealistic that to someone like me it seems almost surreal. My dislike of this movie stems from the fact that i find it difficult to find poignancy in a clearly relevant and troubling subject (racism) when much of the examples in the movie are unrealistic or stereotypes and situations that are very unlikely to happen in real life and act merely as poetry. The fact that this movie has such a high rating seems to prove that ANY movie about racism will get a high rating and is enough to show that it is nothing more than a mediocre piece of cinema. I strongly recommend films such as ""The Liberation Of L. B. Jones"" or ""In The heat of The Night"" over this film."

","There is a real tragedy about this film. No, I'm not talking about the issue of racism in America (or anywhere) which this film feebly tries to address, but rather how a good idea for a movie and an impressive cast were wasted on this overcooked turkey.<br/><br/>This film veers into overkill within the first few lines (Don Cheadle's hideously contrived little monologue about LA) and just keeps going. Haggis has taken the most delicate and sensitive subject in the New American consciousness and slapped his audience across the face with it for two hours. If Haggis had engraved the word ""racism"" onto a five inch nail and hammered it into my skull, it would've been more subtle and less painful than sitting through this film. If it weren't bad enough that he puts his characters in some highly implausible situations (some of which are handled very well from a technical perspective, I must admit) throughout the film, it certainly nails the coffin of believable film-making shut that every single person in this movie is racist to the point where they don't seem to talk about anything else. Every character here seems to have the same dilemma – that their life is wrought with racism and prejudice – but the reasons behind this are never explored. All the characters here are ""connected"" in such a contrived way, one has to wonder if any thought went into it. Beyond this, we are given no reason to try and like or relate to anybody we're introduced to, and the dialogue is so relentlessly obvious and didactic that it almost sounds like it came out of a high school improvised-drama class. Take note, Mr Haggis, we are not as stupid as you seem to think we are. <br/><br/>Because of this, every character soon becomes entirely two dimensional as their prejudice/anger/misery is spelled out for us in almost monosyllabic terms. Presumably the point, not that it could be missed, is that we are all a little racist. Haggis aims to show us this by having all of his characters talk more shamelessly about their views than even the most bigoted people I have ever known. What this film seems utterly devoid of is subtlety. It is subtlety which would have made the story much more realistic, powerful, significant and enjoyable to those of us with more than sub-human emotional intelligence and, by extension, much less insulting to that same fraction of the audience. <br/><br/>The casting is superb and the acting is good (though far from being anybody's best work), but even a group of actors as fine as this couldn't have grounded such fantastically over-the-top characters. Mark Isham's horribly contrived Zimmeresque score does nothing to detract from the brazen theatrics of Haggis' direction either. <br/><br/>In short, this is a grossly overrated, almost child-like fable of urban discontent that aims far higher than it ever reaches and is nowhere near as clever or important as it thinks it is. It would have been far more interesting and far more validating if there was any interest here in trying to understand the cause of racism, but that's not Haggis' agenda. Presumably, the point of this tripe was to highlight something that should need no highlighting to (white, middle class) people who are basically ignorant about it or consider it a myth perpetrated by overtly liberal media or minorities who have a chip of their shoulder.<br/><br/>In other words, this is a movie made BY white people who have no realistic concept of what racism means from the other side (and why should they?) FOR white people who have no realistic concept of what racism means from the other side. If you are one of those people (and you probably don't know it if you are), you might enjoy this pretentious, self indulgent, steaming pile. If you have a modicum of common sense, a hint of social consciousness or the capacity to think for yourself in any way, you're better off looking for a copy of 'White Dog', 'Nothing But a Man', 'Shadows', 'Do The Right Thing' or any number of superior films that address the issue of racism with far more taste, intelligence and subtlety."

","""Crash"" is not the best picture of the year; the Academy got it wrong, which wouldn't be the first time. If you're reading this and have not seen the film ""Crash"" I suggest you stop reading and watch the film so that you, the home viewer, can formulate your own opinion about the film prior to reading this entry. OK now, everybody else ready? Here we go: First and foremost this film is about 12 separate people in present day Los Angeles and their trials and tribulations during a 36-hour period. Though they all have never met before, each will eventually ""crash"" into one another and learn a valuable lesson about life. The overall moral of the film is not to stereotype others and end all racist connotations. So how does the film go about conveying this message? BY MAKING ALL 12 CHARACTERS IN THE FILM A RACIAL STEREOTYPE AND HAVING EACH CHARACTER STEREOTYPE ALL THE OTHER 11 CHARACTERS IN THE FILM!! WHAT KIND OF OXYMORONIC CRAP IS THAT?! This film wants to break down all stereotypes by making everyone in it a stereotype without any explanation of what, why, or how. Does this make any sense at all? None of the characters are decent people in the film (except for one, the Mexican!) due to their negative traits and negative actions. Plus the fact that there are 12 separate stories means the audience member can never understand the rhyme nor reason to each character's traits (which is easy, lazy, despicable writing to say the least). The viewer has no way to empathize with any of the characters in the film. So then why should the audience member give a damn about anything happening on screen? On top of that, there are some technical reasons why this film isn't the best picture of the year, most of which you can read on the ""Goofs"" section of IMDb. Oh, and it won for best editing as well. Way to go Academy! All in all this is a poor film, lazily written, poorly produced, and conveying a message that the messengers themselves don't understand due to the stereotypes that they represent."

There are so many good moments in ""Crash"" that I felt the need to see it again less than 24 hours later. Matt Dillon lead us through his own contradiction with the humanity of someone who knows he carries something rotten inside. The explosive dissatisfaction that permeates Sandra Bullock's life is ferociously real and the frustration of Thandie Newton's character is a first on the screen. We've never seen it quite like that and her performance will stay with me. Larenz Tate personifies both sides of the equation, the one who understands but goes against his instincts, and still there are chilling flashes of innocence in his eyes -- his performance reminded me of the wonderful ""Seeds Of Tragedy"" were his innocence was intact.

Disappointment because I wasted both time and money on this movie, and anger because so many viewers believe in such a contrived, unrealistic portrayal of characters and racism. This film is designed to manipulate viewers into believing that it's a brave and thought provoking story about racism, but it's far from the truth.

Sure, race relations affect everyone and there's a great deal of ambiguity to the issue, but the universe of 'Crash' operates to suggest that we are all victims to our own perceptions on race. It's a tiresome thread that repeats itself ad nauseum and wears out its welcome within the first 30 minutes. I found the outcomes of the characters unsurprising and forced and the film took forever to sputter out and die.

I apprehend that the characters were meant to be stereotypical, so that each of them would represent a general example of each kind of people, but these characters went rather cliché-kind than realistic or objective, especially the nerve-racking goofy black guy one (this goes off pretty bad for this movie, doesn't it?).<br/><br/>You can't even book this movie as constructive, as it focuses on racism so much that it draws away the attention from the presence of hate in general.

Here's a movie that portrays someone shooting someone of another race (out of revenge), but, surprise! no one gets hurt. Here's a movie that manages to cram in almost every racial group into it, but completely steers clear of queers, yes an LA without gays....or gay jokes/slurs. Lots of completely annoying characters angrily spouting off dialog that was clearly written by someone who doesn't have a clue about how people really talk, all in the service of making various racial issues obvious to middle America...and to a completely insipid New Age soundtrack that attempts to keep the audience awake when nothing is happening (and succeeds because of how annoying it is). But, hey, all you need is slick cinematography and a good PR machine and no one will be the wiser, judging from the IMDb rating. ""City of Hope"" did the intertwined story thing first & much better, ""Do The Right Thing"" tackled racism far more subtly than this schlock fest, and ""Falling Down"" did the angry LA racism thing much more believably. ""Crash"" epitomizes everything that is wrong with America: it's unoriginal, it lacks subtlety or believability, it attempts to be all things to all people, and it insists on pronouncing how good it is in spite of its obvious flaws."

","While this film was well done, I am stunned at both the average voter rating on IMDb and it earning the Best Film for 2005. This is a 'tidy' account of racial conditions in the USA, but no more cutting edge than the content found in any 'All In The Family' sitcom from the 70s. There is little character development, with each being one-dimensional regarding their personal discriminations. If this film is supposed to deliver a message, it was lost in my viewing. It appeared that every character's racial subjectivity was influenced and primarily based on the most recent event with that race. In my opinion, racial conditions have improved and evolved in our country further than this film suggests. Personal discriminations in the film are not subtle and are stereotypical to a fault. It was void of subtleties and wit that truly represent an individual's approach and reaction in real life. Comparing this to the other nominees this year, I wonder what criteria the voters based their vote upon to select Crash as the winner. This would be a 'surf-through' movie if you passed over it on the Lifetime Channel (only A-list cameo appearances save it from this deserved placement). This is a 'one-watch' movie and will likely date itself quickly. I am sure the idea for the film came out of a graduate student's thesis and would work well in stage form with an ethnic cross-section of serious undergraduate drama majors."

Regardless of race, this should be done to ANY slut who gives a guy fellatio while driving. The fact that Dillon happens to be a racist – as ALL cops seem to be in Hollywood movies – changes nothing.<br/><br/>Talk about a coincidence plot-device of the DECADE, when Dillon saves the same black woman THE NEXT DAY (no, not a month later, THE NEXT DAY). And as if one such plot-device wasn't enough, we get ANOTHER coincidence not much later, when the black director – yes, the woman's husband – has an encounter with the OTHER cop from the night before, Phillipe. Phillipe is the ""good white cop"". And it is in this scene that we have the dumbest moment in the movie: the director goes berserk when the two car-thief blacks attack him – and then PREACHES to the taller one about being ""an embarrassment"" to him (i.e. the black race) and LETS HIM GO, but not before HANDING HIM HIS GUN BACK!!!!!!! Those two car-thieves. What ridiculous characterization! The way they suddenly assault Fraser/Bullock is something out of a ZAZ comedy. It's as if this scene got accidentally edited into the wrong movie. The two lack credibility. They philosophize like Travolta and Jackson in ""Pulp Fiction"" - except that this is supposed to be a ""deep"" drama, so it comes off all wrong. First the taller one is paranoid about racism, the shorter one making fun of that, and then – inexplicably – they SWITCH PERSONALITIES: the shorter one defends rap music and makes fun of country being racist, while the taller one criticizes hip-hop for being primitive. Ludicrous? Yes: ludicrous. Aside from that, how many young black criminals who look like hip-hop actually CRITICIZE hip-hop?? This is silly and unrealistic.

The way the Persian store-keeper shoots/misses the locksmith's daughter was straight out of the ""Cheap And Overused Plot-Devices Throughout The Ages"" handbook. And then we had the U.S. flag waving in the background as the Persian guy looks helplessly into the distance. It's obvious that the director completed the ""Cheap Movie-Critic-Pleasing Symbolism 101"" movie course. Oh, and Fraser playing a D.A.: not as absurd as Denise Richards playing a scientist, but thereabouts.<br/><br/>Hollywood simply cannot let it go. They HAVE to keep trying and trying to ""solve"" racism in America. But how can a bunch of uneducated, uninformed hypocrites tell us anything intelligent on this subject? You want a lesson in racism? Watch an episode of ""South Park"". Or, if you want some hard, sobering facts, check out Richard Lynn's controversial studies on the subject. The fact that he is despised both by bleeding-heart liberals and the extreme Right should be a recommendation in itself.<br/><br/>The positive sides are that the film isn't boring and I enjoyed the ""rap is crap"" dialog. Also, there is at least a hint that blacks can be just as bigoted as anyone else, which shows that even Hollywood can occasionally wake up and smell the roses. The soundtrack is good – it was just placed in the wrong movie. It evokes scenes from ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, i.e. doesn't fit with L.A. or racism or any of that.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed other crappy Oscar movies, there is no reason you shouldn't enjoy yet more Oscar-winning nonsense.

But in fact, it's just a bunch of coincidences between several characters that connect each other during one day in one of the biggest cities of the world. Who the hell is going to believe that? There are unrealistic situations, one after the other. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latinos, Blacks, and Whites. But the big error relies on a pre-establish racism coming from the writer. Mainly because the White characters in this movie are usually portrait as people with a better social-economical status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor, just like the Asians. And Latinos, as always, are portrait as Housekeepers, police officers, or with a very low profile job like a locksmith. Jesus!!! Don't you guys think it's about time to change these stereotypes? Same with blacks, portrait as gang members, with the exception of a Black TV Director, who was the only fresh character for me. This movie sucks so hard, that makes me so disappointed about the kind of cinema coming out from Hollywood these days. Always with stereotype characters. No realism whatsoever.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","27","44","10 January 2006"," A letdown (spoilers)
","I wasn't the least bit impressed by Crash. It's a film that tackles an important subject (racism) but it's a film that tackles it with two-dimensional characters, contrivances and sentimentality. In the end all it says is that we're all prejudiced in our own way and that prejudice is bad. Well, to anyone with half a brain that's hardly a revelation, but although the message is a little obvious and pap, I would be happy to embrace the film if it were well written and well directed, but it's not.<br/><br/>What disappointed me most about the film was the way the characters weren't characters but mouthpieces instead. It's like Paul Haggis has culled every different opinion and view on race and shoehorned it into his film. At no point does it feel organic. At no point do the people seem like people expressing themselves freely. They always sound like they're reading a magazine article, that someone is putting words in their mouth. Of course this is the case, but good film writing is when you completely forget there's a script.<br/><br/>The worst culprits are the two black carjackers. All they do is discuss the prejudices they face. Sure this may be a subject close to their hearts, but I find it hard to accept that they wouldn't talk about anything else. And yes you may scream that that is what the film is about; prejudice, but I've always thought it much more effective to tackle subjects through themes, rather than have the characters rant about the issue at hand for a couple of hours like they were on Question Time. But then again, subtlety isn't a thing this film is endowed with.<br/><br/>Having said that, though, I do admire the film for at least having a go at tackling racism in an even-handed way. It's a film that acknowledges that racism isn't the sole preserve of whites, that do-gooders do as much harm as bigots and that we're all partly to blame for the current mess. But although these things are touched upon, none of them is investigated in any depth. The film takes a scattershot approach to its subject, rendering it unsatisfactory.<br/><br/>The most interesting segment is the one to do with Don Cheadle's investigation into a shooting involving two policemen. It touches on political spin, the way that shortsighted idiots want to promote people not for their individual merits but for their political value, and the way that pussyfooting around on the issue of race has a negative effect on everyone. But while I think this would make a very interesting film all on it's own, and one that would make more profound comments on race, it's just a brief portion of the film.<br/><br/>Conversely you have a pretty poor segment focusing on an Iranian shopkeeper. The man is like Basil Fawlty without the laughs. He's a complete knob who spends his time ranting and raving and behaving obnoxiously. And he even gets so irate that he tries to kill a Hispanic man who he thinks cheated him (the Hispanic man is the complete opposite of the shopkeeper  he's so saintly it defies belief). But this leads to a syrupy scene where the Hispanic man's daughter intervenes (bathed in ethereal light and accompanied by twinkly music) and inadvertently allows the shopkeeper to rethink his worldview.<br/><br/>And that's another thing that's wrong with the film. All the prejudiced characters in the film have their beliefs adjusted through tumultuous events. I know the film's called Crash and Cheadle at the start says that people are disconnected and only change their views when they collide with other people, but it's not really true. Yeah a traumatic event can change your outlook on life but people's prejudices are more often eroded through time and experience. So while I can accept people changing their views when they crash into other people, it just seems silly when it occurs multiple times like it does in this film. And the way it happens, too, doesn't help.<br/><br/>I've already mentioned the scene with the shopkeeper, but the scene where Bullock embraces her Mexican housekeeper and says that she's her best friend is about as subtle as Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier linking fingers in The Defiant Ones and Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder singing 'Ebony and Ivory'. And then there's the final scene itself. The sassy black car thief frees some Thai people. Wonderful you may think. He's discovered his humanity. But aside from the fact that the scene is saccharine in the extreme, it also makes no sense logically. He frees a bunch of people who can't speak English and who have no money (oh, he gives them $40). They're going to have a good time, aren't they? They can look forward to living on the streets, being spit upon by people in SUVs and, if they're lucky, they might get a job washing dishes. It's the American dream, baby. But then to make the ending even worse, right at the final moment, there's another crash and more racial anger. You see what's the director is saying? The cycle continues. Wow, it's a revelation! <br/><br/>But the thing that infuriated me the most was the idiotic scene where Phillippee shoots Cheadle's brother in his car. It was ridiculous. Philippee picks the bloke up, they behave like children and wind each other up, and then in a tragic mix-up, Cheadle's brother gets killed. The scene is one big contrivance. The director needs a sting in the tail, to again prove that the cycle continues, so you have a big coincidence, an unbelievable argument and a shooting. Yes the races are still uneasy together, yes they're still suspicious and yes the consequences can sometimes be tragic, but by trying to cover all the bases and all the arguments, Haggis spreads himself far too thin. Better to do one thing well than lots of things poorly."

","People are born with good hearts, but they grow up and learn prejudices. ""Crash"" is a movie that brings out bigotry and racial stereotypes. The movie is set in Los Angeles, a city with a cultural mix of every nationality. The story begins when several people are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, we are taken back to the day before the crash, seeing the lives of several characters, and the problems each encounters during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop. A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers. Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways that may surprise you.<br/><br/>This is one movie you must see for yourself, but you can't go to the movie thinking that you will escape life for 2 hours. ""Crash"" forces the viewer to confront racism in the real world. You may take a look at yourself and examine your own preconceptions about race, and see if you are prejudiced.

The screenplay violates one of the simplest but most important rules of writing in ways even a C student in screen writing would be unlikely to do. Ever heard the command to SHOW, NOT TELL? <br/><br/>Since neither Paul Haggis nor his co-conspirators have the talent to show the effects of racism on individuals and society, they tell. And tell. And tell. The actors might as well be reciting a newspaper column, one written way back in the 60s, a decade when this pretentious, self important piece of tripe might have managed to fool even the wisest among us that it had some relevance. Then again, the 60s was the decade of ""In the Heat of the Night,"" not to mention the more obscure ""Pressure Point,"" both of which looked at race relations with unblinking honesty and a knowledge of how people really act, think, and talk. The characters in ""Crash"" are laughable stereotypes who rarely utter one word that sounds like something that would emerge from the mouth of a real human being.<br/><br/>Not since ""Doctor Doolittle"" scored an Oscar nomination for best picture in 1967 (depriving ""In Cold Blood,"" ""Cool Hand Luke,"" and several other better films of that honor) has Oscar made a blunder as bad as giving his top prize to this dim-witted dud."

A series of ludicrous coincidences and right-on messages stack up until I'm left deeply disappointed and wondering what all the fuss is about. Paul Haggis has tackled the subject of race in LA, and that alone seems to have elevated this movie to a new level of interest. Given that most of the Academy voters live in LA and have experienced racism to some extent, this film is sure to have an impact on them.

","***SPOILERS*** One of the worst 'Best Picture' winners in years, and that's saying something. If you want to see a good movie about race, watch 'Do the Right Thing' again (Or if you want something in LA, try 'Falling Down' or 'Colors'). This lame and manipulative set of vignettes is a watered down version of LA long-cast-list films 'Short Cuts', 'Grand Canyon', 'Traffic' or 'magnolia' - take your pick, they're all ripped off here - in support of a not-too-profound thesis: ""You can't judge a book by it's cover"". Not exactly the most thought-provoking take on race relations. Each character is introduced in a situation staged to create one type of perception, and then later contrived circumstances show us that our first impressions were wrong. That's the whole movie, one easy cinematic trick... rinse and repeat. What shocked me most was the many storytelling continuity errors. A cop stumbles across a car-jacking in progress and one of the would-be jackers flees. The jacker is later seen hitch-hiking his way home and is picked up by... the same cop, now off-duty. The car that was getting jacked was being driven by a man presumably going to see his wife, who had earlier been involved in a near-fatal car accident. But his wife's well-being is put on hold while he asserts his rights to the cops who pulled him over, dresses down the other car-jacker after giving him his gun back, and stops to watch a car (that, coincidentally! the cop who pulled him over set fire to after killing the other car jacker... you know, later, when he was off duty) burning. While watching the flames engulf the car, he calls his wife to tell her that she loves him. That's nice honey, are you coming home any time soon? I kind of had a bad day, pinned under a flipped, burning car and all. Did anyone even consider hiring a script editor on this film? It's hard to fault the actors, most of them are quite good. It's easy to imagine a good film in here somewhere, but what wound up on screen is just a sloppy mess which alternates between tragedy and sugar-coated sentiment. Time will not be kind to 'Crash' either - this is NO classic. Unlike, say, Cronenberg's 'Crash'... now THAT was a thought-provoking movie."
"xirzon","6","25","41","14 March 2006"," Poorly constructed morality tale
","The film tells several extraordinary stories happening over the scope of a few days and connects them using implausible coincidences. This makes it difficult to suspend disbelief during the entire film. All the stories share the same motif: There is good and bad in all of us, and racism has complex causes. There is little variation and little originality in the presentation of this theme.<br/><br/>I think the makers of the film were aware of this, and tried to make the film more interesting by arranging it chronologically in such a way that the process of the different pieces of the puzzle coming together is meant to be interesting. Both the film title and the introductory dialogue allude to this, but to me it seemed like a poor excuse not to tell rich, conclusive and well-developed stories.<br/><br/>I do appreciate movies that do not follow a simplistic good/evil pattern; I would have liked to see a more developed and refined story of Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his interaction with Shaniqua and his father, for example. But there are too many plot lines to make any single one stand out, and as a consequence, the characters seem artificial rather than realistic. (As a European, I cannot judge whether the individual subcultures portrayed at all resemble reality.) The movie is not ""trash"" as some reviewers have called it, but it is forgettable and certainly not deserving of an Academy Award. As opposed to ""Brokeback Mountain"", I doubt anyone will talk much about ""Crash"" in 20 years."

"Henry J Sosenite","3","19","30","2 June 2007"," not much here is really of any use to anyone.
","I heard so many great things about Crash. It was one of the best reviewed of the year. actually, I hadn't heard anything bad about it at all. Everyone I talked to loved it. This turned out to be a big mistake on ""everyone's"" part. (I hadn't dug deep enough yet to realize that were plenty of people out there besides ""everyone"" who didn't like it. but that's besides the point of my introduction.)<br/><br/>I think the main problem I had with Crash was that it just wasn't believable, at all. A serious dramatic movie isn't worth crap if it isn't believable. If people really acted like they do in this film, LA would be in a state of war. I know there was the whole Rodney King thing in LA, but that got a LOT of attention. The events in Crash depict racism on a scale ridiculously close to that of the Rodney King incident. I'm never convinced at any point in the film that the events depicted really could happen. In fact, I was just in Los Angeles, and people of various ethnicities seemed to get along with each other just fine. sure, there's racism out there, but Crash is about as accurate on racism as Rambo is on war.<br/><br/>All the dialogue is pretty horrible, too. Totally unconvincing. I couldn't imagine a single character being an actual person in real life. Crash had too many of those oh-so-dramatic scenes where every line is something flowery and deep, and if you actually heard some one say it in real life you would laugh your head off. (Examples- the scene with the gun with blanks, and with Don Cheadle and his mom.) Some scenes were actually moving, like the car wreck, as hard to believe as it was. but these scenes were overshadowed by all the bad scenes.<br/><br/>In the first half of the movie, almost every character was portrayed as a stereotype. I think this was done on purpose... I don't know if the point of that was for them to overcome the stereotypes. Even if they do overcome them, you have an ugly, offensive, and extremely weak first half of the movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like the pretentious and over-used idea of having all the stories interweave. It's been done a lot, but it's never been done this bad. In other movies, the fact that there are coincidences is used to make a point of some sort, but not in Crash. I think this is the main weakness of Crash. they went to all this trouble to put a bunch of chance meetings into this film, and what did it mean that these insane coincidences happened? Nothing. The end.<br/><br/>There's a lot to like under the surface of Crash... sure, lots of characters overcoming their inner demons, and fun stuff like that. but almost nothing on the surface to like. And actually, I didn't really feel as if Crash had anything to say. (One of the impressions I had gotten from other people before I had seen it was that it had a lot to say.) What was the point? Did it really show us anything we don't already know? Was it trying to show us how harmful racism is? Wow, racism is harmful... Who knew. This film certainly didn't change any of my views. Honestly, I can't believe it has ""changed people's lives""- give me a break. In order for it to change your life, I think you would have to knowingly be a racist before you saw it, and seeing it made you change your ways.<br/><br/>Despite all of these problems I had with Crash, I did find some good qualities in it. The music was good. I like Mark Isham. I had high hopes when the movie first started, because the credits had me mesmerized. The music really enhanced certain scenes of the film, too. And, I'll admit that a couple of scenes were moving, although perhaps not genuinely. There was even some pretty strong acting. Ludicrous and Don Cheadle were brilliant. Unfortunately, Crash was still a huge pile of crap. (hah, that's fun to say.) I'd find any John Woo movie to be more believable."

But just to fill the ten lines required, I would say that in ""Crash"", Paul Haggis, writer and director, teach us about racial misunderstanding and wrong human behaviors based on prejudice. The story is about a multiracial group of extremely stereotypical characters passing each other in the night, to predictably meet later at the end in a melodramatic finale. Only in Hollywood (only in the US) it could have happened that such a mediocre movie gets not only good reviews but even an Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the year.

One review, which I wholeheartedly agree with,  comes from Peter Debruge of the Miami Herald. He writes ""Contrived,  obvious and overstated, Crash is basically just one white man's  righteous attempt to make other white people feel as if they've  confronted the problem of racism head-on."" This was exactly how I felt  while watching this movie. The characters were predictable one-trick  ponies, the dialogue was preachy and unrealistic, the situations and  coincidences were preposterous. It seems like it was written by a man  whose only experience with racism comes from what he's read in books  and seen on TV. He has very little in touch with reality! Everything  had an air of melodrama and it felt as if I were watching a theatrical  production (a poorly produced one, at that). For a movie about racism  and stereotypes, most of its main characters and situations were  stereotypes themselves! I found myself saying ""Der!!"" out loud so many  times.  Most of the actors, for what they have to work with, are pretty good,  and there are a couple of scenes that caught my attention and didn't  induce involuntary eye-rolling. But as a woman of color living in Los  Angeles, and having watched this with my best friend (a white male), we  both agree that this movie really hasn't got a clue as to what the real  world is actually like.

","I do not want to do an in-depth analysis of this film. Rather, I'll point out what I consider makes it a very poor effort: the script. The same guy who did the script for CRASH also did the script for MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Both won the Oscar for best picture. I must be pretty out of touch to criticize this guy, but here goes. The main problem is that every character is ""invented"". That is, each character is so obviously the product of a fertile (and I am using that word kindly) imagination. In CRASH the politician and his wife are absolute stereotypes. They speak the most inane lines, like from a comic book or low-grade soap opera. The two cops are similarly contrived. One is a good guy and one is a bad guy. One is an idealist. One is a cynical veteran. I imagine such categories of cops do exist, but to give them life it takes someone who knows the genres, like Joseph Wambaugh. (In fact, to see how really bad CRASH is, just compare it to THE ONION FIELD). We also have the two foul-mouthed gang-banging black youth, hell bent on insanity. Big deal. Anyone can produce such characters. There is the misunderstood, good-guy Mexican plumber, who just happens to love his young daughter oh so much. Etc. Etc. Each character has the depth of a comic-book creation. They all speak in litanies of clichés. The plot too is just a clever manage of intersections. It is so obviously the product of the next cup of coffee or cigarette. It is cleverness without depth or substance. Christ, that this film won best picture just begs belief.<br/><br/>While I am getting in my two cents here, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is the same cliché-riddled mess.

That's bad, right? <br/><br/>The same point could have been made by developing just one of these story lines into something intelligent.

And if that's not ridiculous enough, these characters cross paths all the while.<br/><br/>I know, I know -it's a movie. Okay, then, In the Heat of the Night, A Soldier's Story, Driving Miss Daisy, American History X, To Kill a Mockingbird, Bamboozled, Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing, and the episode of Star Trek with the half-black/half-white faces are all infinitely better efforts delivering the same message without clubbing you in the head and force feeding you morality.<br/><br/>Crash ??

After a while I was not having the ""oh-wow"" reaction that was surely intended... but more like ""oh-good-grief"".

Okay, fine, we get it... people are not ""good"" or ""bad"" but they all have *both* goodness and badness in them... you can stop hammering that point home now! After awhile it just started to ring false... like we were no longer eavesdropping on real-life situations but viewing the work of a biased sociologist who is manipulating the facts to support his thesis. So many scenes just didn't seem very realistic: the Persian man grabbing the gun and going after the locksmith, Ryan Philippe's overwrought reaction to a hitchhiker, even Sandra Bullock's sudden realization of who her ""real friend"" is seemed false. (Aside: we really didn't need to have Sandra's character come out and SAY that her housekeeper was the best friend she's got... the weepy eyes and the the hug was enough, okay? A little more subtlety at times like this would have definitely helped the movie.) And have I mentioned the music yet? Oh please, please, please, make it STOP! That pretentious ""angelic"" score just kept grating on my nerves the more I heard it. The movie is not all bad. Ludicrous's character steals the movie... personally I think they should have just followed him and Larenz Tate around for 2 hours and ejected some of those other subplots. The bedtime scene with the locksmith and his little girl was very sweet and touching in itself but I felt it was enormously cheapened by the later confrontation with the shopkeeper... it was no longer a scene about the characters but merely a ""set-up"" for a (contrived) ""pay-off""."

","Crash is a movie that deals with the structure of society and the racial intolerance that exists within it. I have to say that contrary to popular opinion, I was extremely disappointed with this film and afterwards felt quite frustrated by it.<br/><br/>I found its attempt to provide a commentary on the racial intolerance present in society very fabricated and unnatural. Directors such as Bresson, Dreyer and Tarkovsky have proved that you can achieve accurate emotional responses, without relying solely on melodramatics or manipulative music. Haggis has sold us short and presents deeply complex issues with a series of trite observations that short change the themes of the film. Slow music is played throughout most of the film, providing a symphony for the suffering or pain we see the characters endure on screen. This can be effective in films if used subtly, however in Crash, Haggis has succumbed to the melodrama and pseudo humanist approaches characteristic of soap operas and dramas. A typical example in Crash would be the scene where Matt Dillon rescues Nona Gaye from her burning car. As the action intensifies the music builds and the camera zooms in on the struggling characters within the overturned (and burning) car, and our heart is meant to break. Scenes such as this one frequent the film, but instead of being well portrayed, I found that they were empty and forced. This is because Haggis does not let us form our own emotional responses, and manipulates our feelings and plays to the emotions of its audience.<br/><br/>Crash is as crassly manipulative as it is topically exhausted. The film does not single anyone out and comes to the conclusion that we are all inherently limited in our tolerance of other races, and that we all make rash judgements about people as we try to go about our daily lives. I do not need a whole film to explain this to me - for centuries conflict and oppression has occurred because of political/racial/religious intolerance's, and humans constantly seek to resolve these conflicts wherever possible. Using this principle as the driving theme of the film is pointless and tyring to wring water out of a dry cloth. In an enlightened 21st century where political correctness plagues society, it is insulting to realise that Haggis thinks hes shedding new light on these problems. He does not and indeed he offers no solutions either. I completely reject the idea that this film teaches us about who people truly are  as the films tag line suggests. I struggle to see how anyone closely resembling the characters on screen exists (perhaps with the exception of Sandra Bullocks character). Many of the films characters seem to continually voice their philosophies and conveniently memorised statistics on race relations as though they're recalling extracts from a research essay they've just written. Crash manages to perpetuate the very stereotypes it claims we brand people with."

The real shame is now that Hollywood sees his success, there'll be no end to the offers he receives. Optimistically, at least his film-making skills stand a chance of improving.

Not in quality so much as the sheer moral damage it will do to every strata of this society. To think that the complex problem of racism in America could be examined by throwing a dozen characters together into contrived situations and have their story threads smash into each other (or....crash?) is nothing short of arrogant.<br/><br/>This movie promotes easy answers to this difficult issue. Not that this would be a problem in and of itself, but the fact that it takes itself so seriously when the quality of the piece itself is sub par is what really sets it apart as something unworthy of serious thought.<br/><br/>As far as examining American society, this kind of heavy-handed liberal guilt does nothing but separate us along already testy political lines. Are there any conservatives who are going to sincerely look at this movie and feel something change in their hearts? I doubt it. As far as a movie that examines racism in much more nihilistic and subtle terms, take another look at Night of the Living Dead. As facetious as it may sound, that movie examined American society with a much more critical eye than this batch of liberal tripe could ever hope to achieve.<br/><br/>Between this and Million Dollar Baby, Paul Haggis has shown that he has absolutely no ear for subtlety. And the fact that this current movie features so little actual character development as to have none is reason enough to banish it to the farthest reaches of cinematic hell.<br/><br/>There is absolutely no reason for Thandie Newton to suddenly forgive Matt Dillon's character, there's nothing leading up to Ryan Phillippe's murderous twist.<br/><br/>And the fact that there were so many characters made it impossible to follow all of their stories with the attention that they deserved. This made it necessary for their to be a few too many musical interludes, allowing us the movie to catch up on all the characters and me to catch up on my sleep.<br/><br/>The Academy should be ashamed that they awarded this hooey the coveted Best Picture Oscar when Good Night and Good Luck did so much more with so much less.

Take a close look at how minorities are really portrayed in this movie. Then think of the people we all saw on television following Hurricane Katrina. Does this movie really have anything new to offer that has not been discussed over the last 50 years? No, it is a coop out."

","I normally don't write comments, but after reading the admiration of this film, I was shocked enough to write this review. Crash was a huge disappointment in my eyes. I really like Million Dollar Baby, and seeing how great the cast was, I was expecting a good piece of film. Afterwards my head hurt from the amount of times that the script pounded it's message into my head. I get it, everyone is a little bit racist, even if they don't admit to it. A fine message, but how many times do you have to tell the audience. Every new character that was introduced, I thought to myself, I wonder how this character will be racist. Now, to give the movie some credit, the acting was quite good and some of the scenes by themselves, were pretty entertaining. But on a whole, it was pure drivel. I sat at the Newport Beach film festival cringing for the filmmakers who had been there. And the worst part about it, was the film could have been good. Even with copying Short Cuts and Magnolia. In Short Cuts you had the earthquake that united all the stories, in Magnolia, it was the frogs, and in Crash, it was the snow. It could have been much better, if they took out 2-3 of the story lines, there was just way too much going on, which didn't allow you to connect to most of the characters, even though I really really wanted to. Do not see this movie. Do not waste your time. As for the rest of the reviewers who loved this film, a message is a good thing to have in a film, but there has to be more and you should be ashamed for allowing yourself to be so manipulated by this garbage film."

Whether it's bad acting (Matt Dillon has an emotional range as that of an armchair), bad writing (come on, how many more movies will abuse the idea of this kind of intertwining story lines?), or bad direction (too much slow motion is the most obvious indication of the director's lack of skill and inability to stress the importance of the scene in any other way), or a mix of all of these cinematographic sins - the outcome is truly an Academy Award night 'sensation,' as it is being labeled by media.

A harrowing travail for them, but an impressive thrill for the audience. Equally impressive, perhaps, is the way the large cast quickly and completely inhabit their roles. This film isn't perfect.

Shame on the Academy."
"bliss66","3","53","97","7 March 2006"," Some heart but little humanity
","Though unworthy as a Best Picture Oscar winner by most people's standards, Paul Haggis' Crash does have some heart. But it also lacks credibility as a drama about race, is contrived to the point of trivialising the very issues it appears to want to illuminate and drowns in the bathetic nature of Haggis' script, whose weaknesses as a writer were obviously reigned in by FX Toole's source material for last year's Million Dollar Baby, a film that, unlike Crash, had a director, Clint Eastwood, that knew the power of its story was indelibly linked to his ability to control its emotions. In contrast, Crash is an emotional bubble bath.<br/><br/>Still, the cast far exceeds the requirements of Haggis' thumbnail sketch of a script, at least offering dignified performances where no characters actually exist. Don Cheadle, Loretta Devine, Ludicrous (sic throughout, thanks to IMDb's spell checker) Terrence Howard, Ruby Dee, Brendan Fraser and especially the too little seen Jennifer Esposito; even Sandra Bullock does a fine job compressing the whole of Driving Miss Daisy into about two scenes. Thandie Newton should probably never be hired to play a black woman but I'm pretty sure that was the point of her casting; Matt Dillon as a cuddly faced racist cop is a bit of a stretch but is indicative of the kind of fence-straddling Haggis does throughout. Ryan Phillippe impresses as a gay cop.<br/><br/>But ultimately Crash is too manipulative for any viewer to take seriously. Haggis' dichotomy of human nature is far too simplistic to mark him out as much of an observer much less a sage on issues of multiculturalism. A primary set piece where Haggis sacrifices what little credibility he has for creating a modestly produced, small scale drama about race, is far too contrived and manipulative to engage the viewer furtherat that point, in a scene involving a little girl and some blank ammunition, Haggis reveals precisely his superficial interest in these issues; he merely wants to entertain. Later when he uses a truckload of illegal immigrants as a prop to illuminate yet more triteness about Ludicrous' character, it is precisely thatcompletely ludicrous. That Haggis presents the entirety of human trafficking in a two-minute nutshell is really a shameless, pass the barf bag moment. Crash isn't a film for people with real concerns. That Oprah Winfrey herself compares her experience of not being let in to a Paris branch of Hermes after hours without an appointment to being a ""Crash"" moment completely encapsulates the insincerity and superficiality of this film.<br/><br/>Oscar ignored Do The Right Thing in 1990 and 16 years later they're still not ready for it. That they honoured Robert Altman, whose esteemed and far superior 1993 film Short Cuts is an obvious reference point for the highly derivative, red-headed foster child that is Haggis' Crash, is just one of many ironies that abound in The Academy. Voting Crash for Best Picture would indicate that the majority of academy members have never even seen an Altman film at all. The excellent Hustle & Flow is a far more honest and realistic look at race and culture; despite the presence of two of its stars in Crash (Howard and Ludicrous), you don't see anything approaching the vibrancy or audacity of Three 6 Mafia in Haggis' anodyne Crash.<br/><br/>That said, I think I preferred it when the Australians made it and called it Lantana or, even more so, Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia. Some may wish to check out Lawrence Kasdan's version called Grand Canyon or even the great Michael Haneke's version, the excellent Code Unknown. Even Cronenberg's Crash would be better than Haggis'; though it may lack a heart at least it has some humanity."

The story that followed was a series of soap opera vignettes that I found equally biased and irritating. It is insulting to watch.<br/><br/>References to learning to be black from the Cosby Show and other modern but transitory cultural references always cheapen a script.

","Crash is about thirty-six hours in the lives of various, disparate people in Los Angeles, told as a series of interconnecting vignettes. Some of the people are good, hardworking souls just trying to scrape by, and others are bad people bent on destruction and menacing. By the end, though, some of the good people have done bad things, and some of the bad people have done good things. And they all grew as people as a result.<br/><br/>This wasn't an easy movie to get through. To begin with, nearly every character is despicable in his or her own way. Not so much that one can easily classify them as Bad, no - it's more as if each was being presented as a Good person with Flaws. The downside to that, though, is that it makes rooting for any of the characters is nearly impossible.<br/><br/>Another problem is the writing. Everything is film with such a heavy, hamfisted attitude! Person A has something happen to them, so of COURSE they're going to emerge as a better person as a result. I mean, I'm glad that things don't always turn out like rainbows and unicorns and happy crap like that for our brave characters, but does their redemption (or fall from grace) have to happen so obviously? It's as if the viewer has been hit over the head with a frying pan - BAM! THIS PERSON DID A BAD THING. THEY ARE NOW NOT AS GOOD AS YOU THOUGHT. And then BAM! you get hit again, because the same knucklehead did something else.<br/><br/>I didn't like anybody, and I had a strong sense that if I ran into any of them, anywhere, they sure as heck wouldn't like me, either. What a bunch of miserable, whiny, self-obsessed, self-absorbed twits these people are. Convinced they are right, they haphazardly stomp about the movie, glaring menacingly at people who are different from them, which naturally is supposed to teach us, the unwashed audience, that Different Is Good, and these people Just Don't Get It (Yet).<br/><br/>Paul Haggis wrote, directed, coproduced, and wrote some of the music for the movie. Interestingly enough, the Scottish dish haggis smells just as bad as this movie. What should have been melodramatic was instead uproariously funny; it helps when you've actively decided to dislike the characters. I wished for their deaths, and I bet some of you will, too.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle continues to prove he's a great actor, and Ludicrous was surprisingly convincing, walking away with most of his scenes. But the rest of the gang was dull and trite, doing little with the admittedly awful material with which they had to work. But don't feel too bad for them, folks, because at least they didn't have to listen to the soundtrack, which seemed to consist of one long Enya-like tribute. I suspect it was actually several songs, but it seemed like a continuous stream of overemoting - and inappropriately, at that. You know how in horror films there's this music that'll play that lets the audience know Something Bad Is Gonna Happen? That's what the music here was, only it never stopped."

It was one of those movies I kept watching to see just how bad it was actually going to get. What is meant to be synchronicity is simply ludicrous. What is meant to be a look at racism in LA, (presumably a microcosm of the US) comes off like exploitation. The saddest part is that it seems as if the film maker was actually sincere. The top caliber acting by movie stars (that all must have only read the portion of the script they were in) doesn't' save it. Sandra Bullock comes off the best playing a pathologically angry woman, a departure for her. Having lived in LA for ten years, I also found it to be simply untrue. Over and over I am more often struck by how well so many cultures co habitate here; than by how much anyone hates each other. The entire time I've lived here I can count on one hand the amount of times I've heard a racial epithet cross another persons lips. Real racism tends to play out by omission, by the unsaid, by the slight and by avoidance.

"danielhsf","1","28","48","10 September 2005"," Is this what indie cinema's been reduced to?
","Through its 2-hour running length, Crash charts the emotional anguish of its 10-odd ensemble of characters when faced with the sometimes blatant and sometimes latent forms of racism underlying in American society. That and the emotional anguish of one of its audiences sitting near the front and desperately trying to make sense of what movies have become these days.<br/><br/>The era we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, even the not very enthusiastic flag-waving of post-modernism ideas is always being shot down by what, post-post-modernism that aims to destroy all these ideas, all in no part thanks to the great destructivist ideas of those great 'thinkers'. But I digress. This has nothing much to do with the what the movie is about, but rather what the movie is.<br/><br/>Sure, it seems hard to earn a living in a Hollywood that has to cater to a market that is so post-post-post everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think of whether we like it or not. And so a new studio product is born! Indie films, which once were energetic and idealistic in its defiant experimentalism now seem to be as equally adamant as Hollywood films to sell to indie film markets. An indie film must sell at Sundance before becoming 'acclaimed'. And so nothing is simple anymore. Even what constitutes a good film becomes so murky. Whereas in the past filmmakers just wanted to entertain people and tell a good story--and in these seemingly simplistic attempts the greatest of films are borne--filmmakers nowadays have to make films that are good first and foremost; films have to make people think, have to be meaningful, has to be provocative, raise questions, yadda yadda yadda. What it all boils down to, is a subversion of the Hollywood movie system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formulaic similarity of Hollywood films, the countless ways of differing to essentially be the same product.<br/><br/>And I haven't even begun on the film yet. Maybe I've become too picky on films I see these days. Maybe it's because of my primary need to be entertained, rather than, say, be probed when seeing a movie. But hell, this movie is one big load of crap. And I'm repulsed by this movie not just because it follows the How to Make a Good Movie Good 101 guidebook to the T--characters spout eloquent lines and are sooo witty like they're gifted with the speech of God; it raises issues about racism and life confronting racism in America; it has 'touching' moments where everyone discovers more about themselves and more about other people; not to mention the fact that once you hear the ambient/new age soundtrack of women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you know you're in for all of the above traits.<br/><br/>And something about the aforementioned point--about it raising questions about immediately-compelling issues like racism--pisses me off big time. Like all post-post-post-post-post everything movies, it doesn't contend with just having a message about this issue. Because oh, our audiences are much to intelligent for that these days in this post-post-post-post world. Our audiences want us to make them think, doesn't want us to put things so simplistically, (and then they will go into existentialist crap and say) that's because life itself isn't simplistic. Ha ha ha. What other common drill do we here then the audience need to think about issues rather than have them fed to them. Okay, okay, and okay. So the film makes it a point to pound the audiences with these non-messages and since they're not exactly a message, it's so decidedly subtle and subtle means good right? So we're being hit again and again with this well-written subtlety with the eloquence of rhetorical prose. And as if the irony is not steep enough, we have Ludicrous' character, the only character who seems to not take all these racism discussion bullshit seriously, being 'converted' into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters where he learns something in the end, giving meaningful looks and pauses where audiences are supposed to 'learn something about themselves too'. Um, yeah. How I wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man.<br/><br/>To cut the long bullshit short, I guess I wouldn't have taken issue with the film if it wasn't so bloated in its self-importance. The angst that forms the entire movie felt more like white-boy whining than actual Spike Lee-ish anger. It's so Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the type that wants to wave flags about humanitarianism when the only thing they don't realize is the flag they're waving is their hole-ridden underwear. Plus it's become so trendy in the post-post-post-post world to be completely subtle about it. Nothing is simple any longer. In its best efforts to actually be good, provocative, and ultimately human, it's become neither, imho, just another indie crap from an indie director that wants to make a name out of himself as a credible indie-filmmaker. Now at least Hollywood is more simple and sincere in its manipulativeness."

","Note: SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>""Crash"" is, simply put, the worst film of 2005; a work of such manipulation, condescension and contrivance that it has, naturally, managed to sucker punch everyone into falling for it. A middle school lesson about racism masquerading as a thoughtful examination of today's society, it is foolishly directed and terribly acted. ""Crash's"" worst crime, however, is that it ends up patronizing the very issue that it supposedly indicts. <br/><br/>The plot, if it can be called such, consists of a group of people living in Los Angeles who come into contact with one-another through a series of meaningful coincidences. These people are of various racial and ethnic backgrounds, which cause numerous conflicts between them. <br/><br/>Well, that is one summary. Here is another:there is a group of people in Los Angeles, and each one of them has prejudices; said prejudices may lead to premature assumptions, which in turn can set forth a potentially tragic chain of events. However, when the time comes to put aside their differences and rise to the occasion, suddenly race fails to be a problem. Which summary do you prefer?<br/><br/>Obviously, there is more to my sardonic comments than mere pragmatism. Thing is, there is not a single organic moment in the entire movie. In a ridiculous, self-indulgent and obvious scene, a white woman and her husband get their car stolen by two black men. Of course, this thievery is a result of the white couple crossing the street immediately upon seeing said men (yes, prejudice). Later, when the woman (Sandra Bullock) sees her locks being changed by a Mexican-American locksmith and believes that he will make copies of their keys to give to his fellow gang members, the director sympathizes with her behavior instead of chastising it. <br/><br/>Every scene is like this: pedantic and self-satisfied. I have been told by many that my intense dislike for this film comes about as a result of my unwillingness to submit to a suspension of disbelief. Look, when a film admits at the commencement that it inhabits a world entirely separate from our own, I am all for it, which is why I have no problem with, say, a giant ape fighting three T-Rex's. However, when a film like ""Crash"" tries to portray a societal problem ""as it really is"" but is devoid of a single scene even remotely accurate, I refuse to comply.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie ranges from mediocre to awful. From the former we have Don Cheadle, a phenomenal actor completely underutilized herein, Terrence Howard, for whom the same can be said, and Brendan Fraser, who has a great personality but whom it would not kill to display a slight bit of versatility. <br/><br/>On the latter side, we have Sandra Bullock, who fails to breathe any life into her character, Matt Dillon, who possesses and employs countless blank facial expressions, and Thandie Newton, who is melodramatic in every scene that she appears, overacting beyond all reason. The latter two are involved in a scene that has been praised as one of the year's most powerful, but is really one of the most shallow and far-fetched. <br/><br/>As most of you know, ""Crash"" recently shocked everyone by winning the Academy Award for Best Picture over the heartbreakingly beautiful and complex ""Brokeback Mountain."" Many blamed homophobia for this, which is possible, but I think there is a bigger reason. It is because the Academy bought ""Crash,"" both as a film that explored a crucial issue in our society and as one that will make us better people. <br/><br/>There have been many films made about racial tensions, including Spike Lee's masterpiece ""Do the Right Thing"" and John Singleton's excellent ""Boyz N the Hood."" Those films worked because they were realistic, because each scene got to the very core of the problem it was exploring. ""Crash"" goes in the exact opposite direction, and in the end barely scratches the surface of racism, stereotyping, and prejudice. <br/><br/>In the end, this film will never make us better people, will never lead to tolerance, and will do nothing to eradicate this important problem. It is a contrived, unrealistic drama, full of characters that embody every stereotype imaginable, and its Oscar win is a victory for fabrication over genuine poignancy."

","""Crash"" was completely predictable. The dialogue was wretchedly contrived, and the movie had no point to make except, Racism Is Bad, You Shouldn't Be Racist, Everyone's A Little Bit Racist, Mmmmkay? I'm sorry, but to me, a film should entertain first, and then, if it wants to put a message in there somewhere, that's fine. This is nothing but A Very Special Episode of a cop drama. It's like an Afterschool Special or something. I think the only people who will find this movie 'eye-opening' are white people who have seen people of other races on TV, but haven't actually met any. I'm white myself, but I grew up around people of other races, went to school with non-whites, and have had many non-white friends. This movie pretty much insults everyone's intelligence. The fact that this movie won the Best Picture Oscar tells me that the Academy is comprised of old white people who have no idea what the real world is like. The movie was irretrievably bad, and I was irritated by how easily I was able to predict the plot. Every scene served to set up a really obvious conclusion later in the movie. There were almost no surprises, and what surprises there were felt unrealistic. But then, the whole movie felt unrealistic. I watched this movie with a friend, and I couldn't help but state the obvious message of each scene such as ""This scene is an attempt to humanize the racist cop"" and ""The Integrity poster in the background is meant as an ironic commentary on the lack of integrity being portrayed by the characters"". This movie was a one-note symphony, and missed the point it was trying to make completely. I really wanted to be entertained, but instead I was preached to. This movie so heavy-handedly tries to manipulate the viewer's emotions that it not only fails in the attempt, but causes resentment instead. Sorry, I'm not an idiot. I get that racism's a Bad Thing. I don't need a by-the-numbers piece of Oscar bait to tell me that message. First rule of film-making: entertain your audience. This movie failed to entertain, or enlighten, or do anything but induce eye-rolling and laughter. If this movie were a deadpan comedy, I'd give it 10 stars, but since it's supposed to be a gritty, realistic exploration of the issue of race, I'm giving it 1 star. Self-indulgent Hollywood at its worst."
"The_Void","4","47","86","2 October 2005"," With more cheese than a dairy farm, Crash will repeatedly slap you in the face until you swallow the all too obvious message, sideways. Racial segregation is bad. GOT IT??
","So, what do we need to make a successful movie these days? Racial themes? Check. Lots of names, including Don Cheadle? Check. A message that any idiot can understand? Check. Heavyweight performances? Check. Many intertwined stories? Check. Searing music? Check. A screenwriter with a recent hit already under his belt? Check. So then, I guess Crash is all set for an onslaught of rave reviews - which, of course, it got. Don't be expecting one here though; I'm not fooled. To be honest, I'm sick of average films like this garnering all the credit that should have been saved for real masterpieces. It seems that all you need nowadays is to make people think that you're making them think and you've got an instant hit. The message in 'Crash' isn't portrayed - it's forced. With all the subtleness of a sledgehammer in the face, writer-director Paul Haggis forces the fact that society segregates different races. In fact, despite all his forcing - there actually isn't a message here. There's people helping other races and judging them before knowing them, but never a definite message; thus suggesting that the lecturer doesn't actually know what he's talking about.<br/><br/>Adding to the film's problems is the fact that it's very, very cheesy and the awful music score - which shows how open minded Haggis is by mixing a lot of racial music in - is simply terrible. This film is advertised as a drama, but I would consider it more of a comedy. Haggis probably thinks that utilising sarcasm in his movie will 'make people think', but all it did for me was make me laugh. In fact, it's the moments of comedy - such as the two car thieves' hilarious comedy of errors - that has stopped me from giving this dross bottom marks. Haggis implements these scenes with a Pulp Fiction-like verve, and it's so out of place that it's hard not to laugh. Come to think of it, this Paul Haggis is a bit of a clown - he's got no idea how to make a film, yet he's sitting on a hit and, no doubt, laughed all the way to the bank. I certainly would have been if I were him. Afterall, all he's done here is exploited the way that critics react to racism and 'powerful' scenes set to silly music and made a film out of it. I'll probably be labelled a racist for writing this review; but before you skip down to the 'unhelpful' button, just remember that I'm being honest. Which is more than I can say for Paul Haggis."

","I'm pleased to see that I'm not alone in thinking that this film is a load of twaddle (despite having Don Cheadle in it) and is in the realm of soap. Racism is the lowest of the low, but treating it in this contrived fashion is not entertaining and does no good. The main problem areas are: the use of stereotypes, excessive and unbelievable coincidences, unbelievable changes in character of the protagonists, and trying to get too many strands demonstrating racism into the same plot (if that's what you can call it). <br/><br/>I should have known what to expect with Sandra Bullock in the cast list. On the other hand, my wife thought it was brilliant."
"g--","2","32","56","3 February 2006"," Talks about a lot, but doesn't say anything at all.
","On the positive side, this movie has heart and good intentions, which is more than can be said of most. However any resonance or authenticity is lost in screenplay gimmickry, preachiness and manipulative direction. It's efforts to ""say"" something are simplistic at best. The movie tries to pack in somany issues that all it can do is scratch the surface, hence it is a shallow film populated by one-note characters behaving in mostly unbelievable ways.<br/><br/>There are no quiet moments in the film; it has all the subtly of a dump-truck. Everything is so exaggerated and sensationalized there is no room for imagination and one is left, at the end, with nothing more to think about. The movie does all the thinking for its audience, which personally I find rather insulting.<br/><br/>Also it is hard not to think of ""Magnolia"" when watching this film. ""Crash"" is also a film about an ensemble of characters interconnected by tragic and amazing events over one day in LA. ""Crash"" is derivative at best when compared. I also find it really confusing that Paul Haggis gave his film the same title of another contemporary American (well Canadian really) film, though certainly not widely seen, nonetheless with a very distinctive reputation.<br/><br/>I understand the popularity of the film and all its awards and nominations: people love gimmicky movies. The gimmick in ""Crash"" is the interconnected characters storyline. You've seen it done before in much more original and seamless ways. This movie pushes the envelope to extraordinary limits of ""suspension of disbelief"" to pull off this trick. It is audacious certainly. Some may find it magical; I found it appalling - a storytelling technique standing in for meaning. Hollywood loves this tactic. You could say it is even the very foundation of the Hollywood Narrative. Like political discussions, though tiresome, they keep even the most intelligent minds coming back for more.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, honestly only Terence Howard and Ludicrous (of all people) actually stood out for me. Brendan Fraser continues his reputation as the most inept and laughable actor in American film - how is it possible that someone with so little talent can be cast in ... anything? His agent must be the devil. Most of the performances are so one-note it's hard to be involved with them. Some are even one-scene. William Fichtner - who is he supposed to be? Why isn't this just a scene between Don Cheadle and the DA? Then you could have lost Brendan Fraser, replaced him with William Fichtner, AND this pivotal scene would have actually made sense.<br/><br/>In terms of direction, I can't believe anyone respects this kind of heavy-handed, unfocused work. The use of slo-mo in this film is so gratuitous and unskilled ... I couldn't believe it honestly. Paul Haggis is at the bottom of my list. And he has music playing beneath almost every shot of the film - a sure sign of a lack of confidence behind the camera. Mark Isham's synth-heavy score is pretty cool for a while until the wailing female vocal comes in and it becomes a parody of itself. It sounds like the same wailing woman you've heard in 30 other movies. Then the film ends with two of the worst songs I have heard in a major motion picture. For a movie about diversity, these songs come straight from the collection of a middle-aged white guy who keeps the dial on the easy listening station. Lame, lame stuff.<br/><br/>Nothing amazes me anymore when it comes to the popular tastes of movie-goers, but I am disappointed. If you like your emotions manipulated instead of engaged, and storytelling gimmicks instead of authentic characters, this one's for you. If you appreciate any kind of subtlety in a film, I would not recommend this."
"jdre","3","67","127","5 March 2006"," Didn't explore race relations deeply enough
","Before you ask what I know about race... I was born & raised near East Saint Louis (ever hear of that place?) - in a very racially tense area, many 'displaced' white people who moved out of ESL after the '68 riots. I went to college with classes of 60% students from Chicago's south side. I've been to 32 states, and most major cities in our country, staying in budget to 4 star hotels (mostly budget, though, I'm still a student). I worked with the homeless in STL, and met with racist anti-black-homeless protesters.<br/><br/>Having said that, I've never seen such flat, blatant, open, stereotypical, after-school-special racism in my experiences as were depicted in this ""film"". Racism in the scenarios depicted in the movie (e.g., work) is often hidden, festering inside, and more explicit in structural ways - hiring patterns, public policies, disenfranchising, etc. Or random things yelled from cars or across streets. To me, the movie didn't explore racial issues (beyond the level of ""a very special episode of Full House"") deeply. It showed them in the most basic, flat-affect way possible. Race relations are deeper than ""don't judge a book by its cover"", which is all the insight this movie offers. It's about as sophisticated as saying that the Vietnam War was ""icky"".<br/><br/>Political sociology, economics, African-American history, centuries of oppression, and the psychology of prejudice cannot be summed up by blatantly racist characters saying blatantly racist lines and acting in overtly racist ways. This is the horrible, but superficial side of racism. Race relations run through to the core of culture in America, not just on the surface and in our 'first impressions'.<br/><br/>I'm left with no new understanding - just ""racism is bad"", ""people shouldn't be so racist"". That doesn't impress me. WHY are people racist? WHY are there inequalities in our society? HOW are misconceptions formed so quickly? The movie doesn't care. It just shows us the end product.<br/><br/>As if I wasn't aware there was a lot of racism in America.<br/><br/>That this won best picture and especially best original writing was a joke. This is a 7th grade essay on race relations, and was bogged down by stereotypes when real, round characters would have made a much better point.<br/><br/>I thought that there was more insight in Topher Grace's few lines in ""Traffic"" than there was in this whole film. I think that Dave Chappelle offers more race-relation insight in 5 minutes of standup than this whole film. I think that an episode of ""The Boondocks"" offers more insight, the average true hip-hop album offers more resolution, the average Jet magazine offers more race-relation lessons than this turd of a film."

","'Crash' is about the tensions between various races in Los Angeles. Yes, hardly a topic for a light-hearted romp through the city. You'll probably have to be in the mood for something a lot darker (and at times poignant) which will make you think (just don't think too hard... but I'll get to that).<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice is the wide range of A-list actors on display here. Yes, it's one of those 'ensemble' casts and even those who don't have their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame are definitely also 'recognisable faces' meaning that even those who don't have quite as much screen time as the major stars are all capable of turning in a strong performance.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock may be the 'biggest' star on the cast list, but, in my opinion, it's Matt Dillon who steals the show. What you get is a selection of random - some average, some more privileged - people in L.A. whose lives are all due to 'crash' into each other in one way or another. Yes, that's where the title comes from, but, just in case you miss this meaning, there are also at least a couple of literal car crashes in there as well!<br/><br/>Personally, I loved the film. It shows good and bad people of many different races and gives you a bit of a 'whistle-stop' tour of what it's like to be them. You could be expecting one hell of an epic film with so many people on the cast list. Surprisingly, it's not overly-long and, although this is good that it never drags, many of the characters never really get 'fleshed out' as they probably could have done (had this be made today and given its own Netflix TV series, or something).<br/><br/>I don't see that as a gripe, but those who didn't enjoy 'Crash' as much as me do tend to dwell on how it's all a little too contrived. They ask, 'Would all these life-changing events really happen in such a short space of time?' The answer: probably not. But who cares? Do we stop watching 'Eastenders' because too much happens in such a small area?<br/><br/>It's a film. It's making a point - and quite a brave one. It shows that no one race is all good and always right, possessing the 'correct' way to live their lives. We all have flaws and we all have people of our own 'kind' who are good and bad. I remember it even won some awards when it was first released. I agreed with that decision, but I also recall people disagreeing.

For me, the films relentless jumping from one story to another under-minded any power that an individual story might have. And while the point was to show the relationship between these seemingly unrelated events, in the end it felt like a gimmick. Kudos to the filmmakers for trying to deal with a sensitive and important issue. However, well meaning and ambitious their intentions, it still doesn't make for a good film.

These important men like to believe that Hollywood is still relevant as far as social issues and changing times (which we all know hasn't really been the case since the great American cinema of the 70's). These important men also love paying 'homage' to other films. As others have noted Haggis lifts scenes and ideas directly from earlier films like Pulp Fiction and Magnolia. Truly the mark of someone who isn't very talented.<br/><br/>Although I admit it annoys me terribly that lots of money gets thrown into such bad projects like 'Crash'. What is really insulting and offensive is that there are good filmmakers making beautiful and important films and their work was over- looked so that this piece of idiotshiot could get oodles of nominations (I think it even won a bunch - too depressing for me to look up).<br/><br/>Oh and Academy - please stop trying to bewitch me!

Honestly, racism isn't that interesting on its own, as a constant focus.<br/><br/>However, the movie makes the cardinal flaw of keeping to racism a constant focus with the human story in the background, at least in terms of the way it feels. The characters talk, and they show affection but with a few exceptions (which make up some of the most memorable quiet scenes), their words almost always are about racism in some direct or indirect way. Such as, most blatantly, the articulate gangbanger, who can't help but always philosophize on racial issues. This however was interesting, purely in a pop-conversation way, with the real problem being that the vast majority of the other characters, talk about race in a similar way (based on their context) only not in a Tarantino-like jaunt. The movie is filmed like a character drama of true human context, and so we don't want to see race being the purpose of every conversation, particularly those of more human characters like a Black TV Writer and Assistant DA, who just talk about a singular issue in virtually every single situation they are in.<br/><br/>This is the greatest flaw of the film, but it is not the only significant one. The film is too short, and characters, especially interesting ones like the complex and bigoted cop or the caring father of a locksmith (the one major character who almost completely avoids the issue of race and thus has the best scenes), come off as either underdeveloped or under-seen because we love them so much. This is expounded because the movie relies on coda scenes to wrap up the stories, and a few them, simply do not work. The characters are too underdeveloped for these to have an impact. The final third of the movie also seems to comprised entirely of this, so it gets tiresome, when it feels like the movie just had an ""end movie on this note"" scene literally 10 times prior to the current scene that also feels like an ""end movie on this note"" scene.<br/><br/>However, there is good in the movie. The film, although it can be tiresome and its structural flaws are apparent, never really becomes painful or devoid of entertainment. There are enough interesting elements and good scenes to make the movie a decent viewing experience, however not a particularly worthwhile, satisfying, or greatly entertaining one."

"JetJagMan","6","12","18","18 July 2006"," A poor shell of successful predecessors
","At the time of this writing, this film ranks #92 on IMDb's top 250. The only explanation for this is that most of those voters haven't seen Amores Perros, Thirteen Conversations about One Thing, Magnolia, or several other intersecting-lives movies.<br/><br/>The intersecting-lives template was already played out by the time this movie came along. Why it won Best Picture? Maybe it just sucked the least of the films up for consideration this past year, or maybe the academy didn't want to award it to the gay film Brokeback Mountain, as so many are hyperventilating. I haven't seen BM so I can't say. The Oscar award probably also explains the high IMDb rating, because many simple-minded folk went and saw this due to the controversy of it beating BM to the Oscar, who otherwise would be busy seeing things like Kill Bill or Shrek 2.<br/><br/>It really seems like a clumsy attempt at something beyond its capabilities. When cellular car phones first came out, in the 1980's, I saw a crappy cheap car with a bumper sticker that read ""I love my cellular phone"". I looked in at the front seat and there was a common house phone sitting there, pretending to be a cell phone. A cheap, non-functioning, clumsy attempt at imitation. Another example is ""fusion"" cuisine. Some foofy upscale restaurants develop fusion menus, and suddenly there are walk-up counters in food courts with laser jet printed signs saying ""Fusion food served here!"" So what am I getting on about with these illustrations? Crash is really a poor attempt at the form done very well in Amores Perros, and slightly less so in 13 Conversations and Magnolia. Heck, the American remake of Traffic, also with Don Cheadle, is a better intersecting-lives movie and it doesn't really fit the template! Why isn't Crash so good? Well, if you see the aforementioned, you will see much further developed character arcs and little politics and supermarket checkout stand magazine sentiment. The characters in Crash do everything but cite bibliographic references for the issues they are each assigned. The audience should be trusted to reach some conclusions on its own based on the strength of the movie, rather than have them dictated to them.<br/><br/>And don't forget the musical interlude 3/4 of the way through! You know, where some sappy song is played, and each character is seen looking out the window, presumably contemplating the drama they have just been through, but in actuality probably hoping this movie doesn't sink their careers.<br/><br/>The only reason to see Crash is so you can see the movie that knocked the cowboy lovers out of their saddle."
"marissas75","4","12","18","14 March 2006"," Not so deep
","I admire Paul Haggis's intentions in making ""Crash""--I'm sure he honestly believed his movie provided penetrating insights into urban American race relations. I understand that he wanted to show how people's lives can intersect in fascinating ways, how sometimes it takes a great shock in order to jolt us out of our patterns of thinking and reveal our common humanity. Unfortunately, the methods he uses to get this message across are rarely subtle and never as profound as he thinks they are.<br/><br/>The problem is that ""Crash"" never goes any deeper than pointing out that everyone has the potential to be both a racist and a caring human being. Rarely does it suggest why its characters automatically revert to racist thinking whenever they are stressed or angry. Only Matt Dillon's character is given some motivation: he has a monologue describing his hatred of affirmative action. But we never learn why most of the other characters are so quick to hurl racial slurs at one another--or, for that matter, why the Mexican locksmith is the only character in the film who is not racist, despite living in a community full of bigots.<br/><br/>I've written ""Matt Dillon's character"" or ""the Mexican locksmith"", rather than using the characters' given names, because those names are so unimportant in the script. (For the record, they are ""Officer Ryan"" and ""Daniel,"" respectively.) The characters are blatant types, with a few surface contradictions but little real insight into how race and ethnicity has affected their lives. I would love to know how Don Cheadle's character ended up a successful detective, while his brother is a criminal. Or what prompted the Persian storekeeper to buy a gun in the first place. We learn how the privileged white Jean (Sandra Bullock) feels about her Latina maid--but how does the maid feel about her employer?<br/><br/>""Crash"" is also poorly structured and directed. For me, the best moment in the film is when Officer Ryan rescues Christine (Thandie Newton) from her car: the situation is so emotionally charged, and the direction so simple and powerful, that it works in spite of itself. But this scene, which ought to be the climax of the movie, instead comes about an hour into it. And the impact of a later scene, which could be equally powerful if handled correctly (it involves Daniel, his young daughter, and a man with a gun), is counteracted by Haggis's decision to demonstrate to us that this is an emotional moment, rather than letting us figure it out for ourselves. He goes overboard with ponderous music, slow-motion, and shots of agonized, crying faces. When he later employs the same music and slow motion as Jean falls down her staircase, the effect is so anticlimactic, it's laughable. Haggis also seems not to know how to end the movie: he takes too long tying up the various plot-threads, and strains too hard for a sense of redemption and hope.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, ""Crash"" did keep me continually engaged, even if some of the story lines required me to suspend my disbelief to an absurd degree. The large cast of actors do the best they can with Haggis's superficial script, and the Los Angeles landscapes are nicely filmed in a palette of ambers and blues.<br/><br/>Racism is an issue that society (and the movies) still often refuses to discuss. It's a pity, then, that when a movie about racism does get made, it's as shallow as ""Crash."" Although individual scenes are effective, individual lines are witty, and some of the questions raised are provocative, the overall effect is unsatisfying."

It's the kind of movie where every actor and actress is lining up to be in it like an Altman or Woody Allen movie. But my brain kept firing off throughout the film ""something's wrong. This isn't working."" I suppose the problem was the script and partly the first-time out director. Every character was angry at everyone else in every scene. From psycho cops to paranoid gun-toting store owners to... everybody else. Except Don Cheadle, he just wore this Bob Newhart frown all the time. Maybe cause he realized the movie (he took part in producing and perhaps financing) was turning into a lemon before his eyes.<br/><br/>A few interesting social insights were raised during the film, but as another IMDb'er pointed out, it felt like a bad version of MAGNOLIA (although in my opinion, the original version of MAGNOLIA was lousy). Also reminiscent of SHORT CUTS - which was a much better film.<br/><br/>When the dynamic of a film is constant tension and anger, there's really nowhere for it to go. I am mystified that the diversity of taste of today's film viewers and amateur REviewers places this film anywhere in the IMDb top 250. This list is pretty meaningless. I'm 46.

"thewillt08","3","5","6","4 April 2013"," Way Too Much Going on
","I surf Netflix all the time and put them in my instant queue and I finally go around to watching Crash and it reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction. That is, if Pulp Fiction made no sense had stupid characters and was a little less racist. Yes, that's right, less racist. Crash has a huge list of actors from William Fichtner to Brendan Frasier and even Ludicrous. Oh boy, do I have a lot to say about this movie.<br/><br/>Where do I start? OK, this movie has little to no plot, way too many characters I don't care about, and it is a knock off of one of the best movies ever, Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction was so great because there were a few characters whose lives intertwined perfectly. These characters lives intertwine but when it happens I just didn't care. I was thinking throughout the movie where and when it would end and when it did it felt like nothing even happened. This movie literally could have ended anywhere. The first scene is of a crime scene and you would think it ends there but it doesn't. It ends in possibly the worst way imaginable. I have a 1000 word limit but that isn't enough to explain the disgrace that is, Crash.<br/><br/>Movies have had race problems all the time but this movie is kind of built around it. That isn't really a problem if it works and here it doesn't work. Everybody is racist in this movie. I do like how racism is shown and life can be like this, but this is extremely exaggerated. The police are racist. The Middle Eastern store owner is racist. The poor, black gangsters are racist. The rich, black people are racist. I have seen racism in movie but this was crazy. The first scene with Ludicrous is him and his friend walking out if a restaurant and he is talking about race. This was a really interesting conversation early on in the movie and it really sucked me in. It got me excited to watch the rest of the movie. It reminded me of the diner scene in Pulp Fiction, but it blew it. The movie pushed onto more and more characters and destroyed the potential. There were flashes of brilliance in the movie. Characters stories intertwine and in one of the most disgusting people I have seen on screen has a moment where he is human and I liked that. Crash wasn't a complete disaster but I expected better. Towards the end of the movie there is one scene that caught my attention once again and I thought the movie would improve, but once again I was disappointed. I wanted the disaster to be true because the movie would have been realistic and a stronger message would have been sent. As a new generation emerges, a generation I am a part of, race, sexual preference, hate, is in a decline. I feel the new generation will be more accepting of people and it is people of the older generation that still hangs onto racial tensions. Prejudice and stereotypes will always exist but they will be less offensive and people won't care as much. Anyway, I digress, this movie sends a message of racism and how it can destroy lives and how it affects society. The message and deeper meaning of this movie is good, it was the presentation and delivery that was a disaster. I can't tell you who the main character was, I can't tell you the plot, and I can't tell you why somebody would enjoy this movie. Overall, Crash had potential to be a good movie. It was too disorganized and messy. Each character had good stories but there was too many of them. Ludicrous' story was good. Fichtner's story was good. The rich black family's story was good. The emotional music was good. All these things were good on their own but when you put them all together it is a mess and hard to follow. I almost would have preferred ten different movies diving deep into these characters and having their stories intertwine. Have the racist cop save the woman he abused just the night before in a car accident but maybe have him involved in Ludicrous' story more. Stories need to be cut and intertwined closer and it would have been a lot better. I would like to see this remade in a different style, but I have to give Crash the WillyT Seal of DISapproval. It's a shame because I wanted to enjoy this movie, but the only thing I enjoyed was hating it and awaiting the time I had to write and rant about it. You're welcome."

The script was just crap, jumping from one character's story to the next. I heard that it does that and the movie ties it all together. Aside from the cop and the wife of the Mormon guy, there was really no ""ohmahgosh I see how these lives are intertwined"" moments. It was so poorly executed contrary to all the hype and hubbub. And as far as the casting... for the era the movie came out, names like Cheedle, Bullock, Fraiser, etc etc... their parts were minimal. Brendan Fraiser's character had like 2 scenes; Bullock, 2 lines.

Let me explain:<br/><br/>1. We get it. Racism is bad. Very bad. And what's worse, is that a lot of people are racist in the world. HOWEVER, the smarmy, one-dimensional portrayal of racism in Crash is at best a simplistic cop-out and at worst patently offensive to every race and audience member involved. Crash fails to acknowledge that the vast majority of people living in the world (or at least the ones willing to pay $9 to see a movie about racism) understand that judging people based on skin color is a horrible, despicable thing. And while I know racism lurks in every corner of this so-called society, I am not silly enough to think that hate and prejudice are always the result of active decisions made by spiteful, hateful people. It can be systemic, an exoticization, a fetishization, a categorization or any other number of bigoted acts. Crash however, would have you believe that racism is merely the result of people who are hurting on the inside lashing out at the nearest, most differently-pigmented person they can find. In Crash one gets the idea that every character wakes up in the morning with a to-do list that reads, ""shower, pick up some milk, oppress a honky/darkie/towelhead/spic etc."" One leaves the theater thinking that with all that time spent hating people, making racist comments and waging general race war, Crash's characters probably wouldn't have much time left for hobbies. <br/><br/>2. While some may see in Crash another film in the collagist vein of Magnolia, Short Cuts etc, I see a million moments of utter plagiarism. Need I even discuss the films penultimate 15 minutes in which a song not quite sung by Aimee Mann underscores cross-fading closeups on characters who are not quite singing, as not-quite-frogs (read snowflakes) begin to fall from the sky!?...For those of you have not seen Magnolia and completely missed that reference, I apologize. But seriously, I thought Garden State's cinematic thievery was bad......<br/><br/>3. Tony Danza makes a completely ABSURD cameo appearance. Go get em' Tony. Hi Sandra Bullock, my name is acting, remember me, we met a long long time ago...oh and say hi to Brendan Frazier for me will ya...Enough said.<br/><br/>OK, I'm starting to slam the keys of my computer just thinking about this pedestrian, uninsightful, insulting, vacuum of a film.

Then she screams at her Hispanic maid for not putting away the dishes. Then she sprains her ankle and none of her rich bitch friends come to help her but the Hispanic maid does. She puts her arms around the maid and says, ""you're my BEST friend"". <br/><br/>Then, black carjackers (one nice, one bad) hit a poor/innocent/hardworking ""chinaman"" with Bullock's stolen car as he's getting into his van. Chinaman's wife finds him in the hospital and he tells her to ""cash this check immediately"". It's a paycheck for the slaves still chained in the back of his van - because, you know, slave trafficers are paid by personal checks. <br/><br/>Matt Dillon is racist cop who pulls over rich black couple, Terence Howard and Thandie Newton. Dillon makes them get out of expensive car, spread 'em, cop gropes wife, husband can't do anything about it. White racist cop forces black husband to make humiliating apology in exchange for ""freedom"". At home, drunk black wife screams at black husband for being a coward. <br/><br/>While all this is going on racist cop's white partner, Ryan Phillippe, does nothing. Then asks his black commander for a transfer away from racist cop. Black commander won't grant transfer because he doesn't want to be seen as attacking lower ranking white racist cop. Later, non-racist Phillippe picks up a lone black hitchhiking teenager (the ""nice"" car jacker from above), in the middle of the night because - so many people, cops or otherwise, do that... They get into an argument for no reason. ""Good"" hitchhiker/carjacker reaches into his pocket for St. Christopher statue because lots of black/teen/thugs carry those with them. Non-racist cop thinks he's going for a gun and shoots thug dead. Non-racist cop dumps good/black/carjacker's body on the side of the road. <br/><br/>Persian store owner and daughter buy a gun. White gun shop owner says they're responsible for 911. Persian store owner has Hispanic locksmith (same from Bullock's house) fix lock on his store. Store gets burglarized anyway. Asian insurance adjuster won't cover burglary because door/lock weren't good. Persian guy gets his new gun, hunts down Hispanic locksmith to kill him (btw, Hispanic locksmith speaks perfect English and is best daddy/husband in the world to 5 year old daughter and wife), finds him and confronts him with gun in front of his home. Locksmiths's daughter runs out and jumps into Hispanic daddy's arms to protect him as gun goes off. Hispanic daddy/locksmith screams over shot daughter (long story about magic bullet proof cape she's wearing). Persian killer (not responsible for 911) looks on in horror. But 5 year old isn't shot. Bad/white/gun store owner had sold him blanks to go with gun purchase because, you know, 911. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle is an LA detective with a crack addicted mother and a missing brother, and a ""white"" girlfriend.

Brother turns out to be black/teen/thug/carjacking/hitchhiker who's body is found on the side of the road shot by non-racist cop Phillippe. Cheadle and his crack mother identify brother/son's body. She blames Cheadle for brother's death because he ""didn't find him and bring him home"". Cheadle is sad because crack mother thinks groceries came from thug/carjacking/hitchhiking/missing son and not him...<br/><br/>Racist cop Matt Dillon is actually a ""good"" guy because he cares for ailing father who can't pee. He also saves black/angry/drunk/rich/wife (from earlier ""spread 'em"" traffic stop) by pulling her from fiery crash. Rich/black/""spread 'em""/husband later ends up being car jacked by ""bad carjacker"" from earlier Bullock carjacking. They get into high speed argument, ""I'm taking your car - no you're not"", and end up being pulled over. Rich/black/spread 'em""/speeding/husband decides this is a good time NOT to cooperate with cops. Standoff ensues. Non-racist white cop, Phillippe, happens to be there, intervenes, everyone backs off. Bad carjacker has been hiding in ""semi-carjacked car"" through all of this. Rich/black/husband lets bad/carjacking/thug go but tells him, black to black, he's ashamed of him.

Good/black/teen/carjacking/thug is dead on the side of the road where his brother, Detective Cheadle, finds him during investigation. Sandra Bullock still loves her Hispanic maid. Dillon, the good/son/racist/molesting/cop is now a hero. Un-shot Hispanic locksmith family lives happily ever-after. Persian store owner goes back to store happy he didn't become a murderer. Detective Cheadle just goes on being under-appreciated by crack mother. And then there's another car crash and you don't even care at this point.<br/><br/>This is a mediocre movie with a manipulative screenplay. It makes a pretense to be about interconnectedness but ultimately it's a laundry list of all the racist/racial possibilities in people. And then flips each one on it's head.

Not worthy of an Oscar nomination for best film, let alone winning it. Goes to show that the unfounded and incorrect perceptions about every day Americans extends beyond the makers of this film and ripples throughout the Hollywood industry. Amazing what they can come up with when surrounded by ""yes"" men in their mansions on Mullholland Drv."
"OldAle1","3","8","11","25 November 2008"," Haggis re-defines and expands on the meaning of heavy-handed
","This didn't look all that good to me when it came out; looked like a just-as-obvious only more-black updating of Lawrence Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"" and that seemed unlikely to be something that would win me over. Shocked when it won Best Picture; also shocked that one of my favorite critics loved it, and even more shocked now that I've actually seen it. I knew I was going to be in trouble pretty quickly, the glossy, burnished artificial lighting and restless camera just didn't seem to belong to the rather intimate story Haggis was trying to tell.<br/><br/>Ah, but what's that? Intimate? LA is the world, Haggis wants us to believe, and the world is racist, hateful and violent. All of it. Without exception. This is what was so noxious about the film to me -- every single character is a collection of hatred, fear, suspicion and suspended violence; and every character (of course) has a moment of redemption, and obvious and simplistic choice of whether to do ""evil"" or ""good."" The cardboard, one-dimensional treatment of the ""people"" here is made even worse by the extraordinary and ridiculous set of coincidences that bring them all together, completely Dickensian in scope but completely underserved and unbelievable, because these are not people but types and cut-outs. Asking me to accept all of this in a two-hour film that never fleshes anyone out beyond skin tone and class, and asking me to accept that this is the world we live in....too much, Mr. Haggis. If I believed that ""Crash"" was the world, I'd have killed myself long ago. It's hard to remember a more cynical film with a worse view of humanity, which wouldn't alone make the film worthless -- it's the simpleminded, heavy-handed psychology behind it all that does that. And I saw that as someone who considers himself pretty cynical, and pretty negative in his prognosis for humanity. This is unquestionably the worst Best Picture winner I've seen, and one of the worst films of the 2000s so far. I liked a couple of the actors (Terrence Howard especially) and I have to say I was kept interested -- if only to predict nearly every scene and then to choke up laughing when I was right.<br/><br/>It's a sad, sad commentary on Hollywood that this film and ""Driving Miss Daisy"" are the two most visible, award-winning dramas about race in the past couple of decades, and that two of our most gifted directors (Charles Burnett and Spike Lee), who both happen to be black and have never won Oscars, still have to struggle to get financing on anything that's not white-oriented enough."

","When the lives of an L.A. cop, a half black couple, two black thugs, a rich couple, a black man whose mom favors his son, a middle easter shopkeeper, a Mexican mechanic and his daughter, and a rookie cop collide, there is no stopping the skid marks from appearing. This film was made in the style of one of my favorite films. MAGNOLIA. The different characters and they way they interact with each other just gives off that fresh cinematic feel. The film works very well.<br/><br/>The whole racist theme seems at first to be what holds the character's lives together, but these characters are very human and everyone does know people who behave these ways. The acting is, overall, top-notch. The storyline is generally well crafted, and everything else, from the music score to the filming style and cinematography, is perfect. And yet, I do not like this movie.<br/><br/>It is simply not my kind of movie. I don't really like movies that try to give you meaning and not knowing how to do it. Don't get me wrong, this film has a good message, but the way it is delivered feels too overdone. This film will make you think, and this film does need to be talked about after it is finished, but I just wish the film gave the audience a chance.<br/><br/>Not everyone likes a movie that teaches you or forces you to think. But by giving the film too much of a grim tone set aside by spectacular and inspiring and breathtaking scenes, it just doesn't feel right. And that's where MAGNOLIA gets it right. And that's why this film irritates me. There is a particular scene near the end that i will not ruin suffix to say that the scene throws a completely unfair blow to the audience. It is especially irritating that the circumstances surrounding the scene are completely unlikely.<br/><br/>Overall, i recommend the film and i do feel that there was a great deal of talent working on it. The film had won Best Picture for the Academy Awards of 2005. Do I think it should have won? Hell no. The other four films that were nominated were wonderful films that i felt deserved the Oscar far more than this. This, to me, was okay, as a film, its a step in the right direction.

"suffolkbansheefilms","7","24","41","6 March 2006"," An overdone, melodramatic, emotionally manipulative piece of ""issue"" film-making, clearly not the Best Picture of 2006
","""Crash"" is a perfect example of a preachy, polemical ""issue"" film that takes itself far too seriously. Its almost absurdly overdone message, that racism is bad, that it affects us all regardless of our ethnic background or position in society, but that we all have a chance at redemption by just...trying a little harder...to understand one another...and just get along...; is so extraordinarily simplistic, and yet throughout the piece so force-fed to the audience in great fits and gasps, that at times it makes the intelligent or thoughtful viewer cringe. I was amazed that Crash was even in the Best Picture lineup, along with ""Munich"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"", both of which are far subtler, darker, more genuine pieces of film-making that seemed neither preachy nor polemical. And though it had a clear message of the importance of journalistic integrity and press freedom, ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was a brilliant work of political noir which achieved contemporary relevance without trying to in any way, given its unerring focus on the events of the McCarthy era; again, its bravado and punchiness made it a far more powerful, engaging and meaningful film than ""Crash"". I have not yet seen ""Capote"" but by all accounts it is a masterful work; I find it hard to believe that in light of the accolades it has received, ""Capote"" could be outdone by ""Crash"".<br/><br/>I was even more amazed that ""Crash"" actually won Best Picture in the face of its opposition. Clearly inferior to at least three of the four films it was competing with, I'm just bemused as to why Academy Members chose this movie for the coveted Best Film award. The fact that it was set in Los Angeles, as some commentators have suggested in the last few hours since the ceremony? The fact that it deals with racism, albeit in a remarkably heavy-handed and sometimes clumsy fashion? The fact that it deals with an issue, though perhaps not as contentious an issue as the decades-long repression of gay rights? I think the choice of ""Crash"" should be instructive as to the sorts of films that aspiring Oscar-seekers should try to make in future: ""issue"" films that bludgeon their message home, and more importantly that address the ""issue"" in a manner which, ultimately, most people couldn't help but agree with (after all, who could possibly legitimately challenge the proposition that ""racism is bad""?); that don't really challenge an audience, but instead simply bathes them in ideology - albeit ideology barely concealed behind a thin veil of coincidences, crossed paths and ""learning to be a better person from the misery of the world"" character arcs.<br/><br/>""Brokeback Mountain"" was not an issue film. It was an understated love story that asked a lot of its audience without really asking anything at all. It did not cram the issue of gay rights down the viewer's throat (no pun intended), but instead focused on humanizing the characters to such a profound extent that their plight became real, and the ""issue"" arose of the audience's choosing, not the film-maker's. In dealing with themes of repression and desire that are universal, it struck much more of a chord, certainly with me and with everyone else I know, than the reliant-on-coincidence, parable/fable atmosphere created by ""Crash"", which at times seemed fake, contrived and almost ridiculous.<br/><br/>I have given Crash 7/10 for its performances, which were excellent in the main (Terence Howard and Ryan Phillipe in particular stand out in my mind), and for its technical achievements, which were impressive. The cinematography was quite beautiful in places, with LA afforded a haunting feel, coupled with a score which, though melodramatic and emotionally manipulative, set the film's tone and gave it a sense of wider meaning. But again, ""Crash"" was outshone even as a technical achievement by the gritty urgency of ""Good Night and Good Luck"" or the sweeping, heartfelt and achingly empty landscapes captured so well in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Even ""Munich"", with its grim depictions of Black-September-era violence, to my mind eclipsed ""Crash"" as a technical piece, refusing to shirk from the heavy, mind-dulling impact of its grisly imagery and perfectly capturing the atmosphere of Europe and the Middle East in the 1970's. In the face of such competition, ""Crash"" pales into the background.<br/><br/>To my mind, subtlety, complexity, and allowing an audience to make difficult decisions for themselves are far more powerful mechanisms for both story-telling and argumentative reasoning than establishing a theme or an idea, and literally ravaging your listener/viewer with it. Though in its convoluted story and interconnected, disaffected characters ""Crash"" gives the appearance of employing the former, in reality it employs the latter, berating the audience with its notions of race, mutual respect and tolerance in a quite extraordinary fashion - though these are noble themes, propagandizing them belittles their value to an audience and greatly diminishes the impact of these grand ideals. For these reasons, the decision to name ""Crash"" the ""Best Picture"" of 2006 must, in my opinion, be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism, which must thereby raise difficult questions about what exactly the Oscars are for in this modern age - are they genuine artistic endorsements, or are they merely marketing tools or vehicles for endorsing simplistic, uncontroversial idealism that gives Academy Members a warm, fuzzy feeling without really challenging the established norms of a society? I support the Academy and the Oscars as an institution, but my overall faith in their ability to make good decisions dwindles in the face of such a film taking the most important accolade any film can obtain in the industry, particularly in light of its impressive, and underrated, competition."
"buystuff1_855","6","24","41","19 February 2006"," The Message Mangles the Means
","The message at the heart of Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is admirable and true: as human beings, we are all afflicted with racial biases and a tendency to stereotype those who are different from us, consciously or unconsciously, and this demeans and distorts a great many of our relationships. Thus, we are always ennobled by overcoming our prejudices. I whole-heartedly agree with this message and I believe it is worthy of respect. Unfortunately, in art, no matter how good a message is, it doesn't justify mangling the means used to express it.<br/><br/>The means of a story are character and plot. Strong characters can sometimes save a weak plot, and a compelling plot can sometimes support weak characters, but no story can succeed when both of these elements are dysfunctional. In ""Crash,"" the characters are little more than collections of cultural attitudes: more character types than real human beings. They interact in a highly contrived plot made up of preposterously unlikely coincidences. These coincidences converge in various dramatic scenes which are well performed by excellent actors, and occasionally they even have some good dialogue to work with. But since the characters aren't fully developed, and many of the situations are so pat and improbable, there is no verisimilitude in many of the critical scenes, and thus, no sympathy for the characters, and so, no real drama.<br/><br/>""Crash"" has good intentions. In this case, they paved the road to, if not mediocrity, then a more fashionable suburb close by."

","It had all the modern premier film touches: great shooting, good acting, but a flawed, cheesy script and theme with that annoying ethereal emo music. I was not impressed with the same old racial stereotypes, but they did change them up a bit. Even the black punks in the beginning, who babble on about imaginary racial conspiracies while proving the black negative stereotype correct, felt flat. For instance, the bigoted gun store owner, not a far out stereotype from my experience, would probably put business ahead of bigotry and not tick off his Iranian customers. Though to it's credit it showed everyone being racist to everyone else. There was even a subplot where two undercover cops crash into each other then shoot it out, a dead black the surviving white. The LAPD wants to hang the white survivor out as a scapegoat to the black power mob while the black investigator assigned to the case has serious doubts.One of the saddest scenes was when the black investigator's junkie mother was ranting about how ""his people"" killed her other criminal carjacking son. Well, technically it was true. But if anyone led to her dead criminal son turning out how he did, it was his worthless junkie mom. In a sad way that is so real, the people who do the most complaining cause the most damage.<br/><br/>Basically, this was a B level melodrama that would have been dynamite in the 60's but in the 2000's, it sounds worn out, exploitative and tinny. But it did try to tackle a serious issue and is probably one of the best of its type. I went back to this because of all the racial tensions created by the media and the black power race baiting mob in these days. The latest racial nonsense like the Oscars are too white really grind my gears, not to mention such rubbish as making a total punk lowlife like Michael Brown into an innocent victim, replete with lies about how he was holding his hands up when he was shot. Compared to all the garbage like I mentioned, this movie was almost documentary and objective. AND IT WON THE Oscars, yet the race baiters like Jada Pinkett seem to forget that.

","I had heard and read from several sources that ""Crash"" was a great movie. I whole heartedly disagree with that conclusion. It is entertaining, just as is the television show ""24"". Entertaining, yet completely contrived. The writer/director, Paul Haggis, who also wrote the screenplay for the overrated ""Million Dollar Baby"" leaves little to the imagination and leaves the viewer being spoon fed pablum. Haggis essentially has a cast of characters who, in their own way, portray many of the stereotypical prejudices in American society. The circumstances of the movie are so unrealistic that they are almost a parody of what ""Crash"" seems to be attempting to showplace. Many of the scenes are predictable and the movie comes off as contrived. The characters are, as a whole, very unrealistic, especially the car-jacking duo and their pre-crime dialogue. Many of the characters come across as caricatures. <br/><br/>That some list this movie as the best of 2005 is completely laughable to me. If in order to enjoy a movie you need everything spelled out for you, Haggis' movies will tickle you pink. On the other hand, if you don't need to get hit over the head to understand a point being made, Haggis' writing will strike you as sophomoric. If the dialogue were just a little bit different, ""Crash"" could have been black comedy. If that were the case, I'd give it a higher rating."

What we end up with is a blending of caricatures that fail to evoke sympathy because of their lack of realism. These characters exist simply to be racist and bitter and, with little exception, never show another side of themselves.<br/><br/>The acting is for the most part superb with great performances by Matt Dillon and Terrence Howard which helped to flesh out the shallow roles they were handed.<br/><br/>The plot twists and interaction between the characters were, for the most part, simple and manipulative. The one character we are set up to worry about is painted as saintly with no flaws, just a regular guy trying to do his best while everyone around him is a racist hate machine. There is one child in the film and she serves as a sympathy generating plot device and nothing else; we see no deeper aspect of her other than her fear.<br/><br/>All in all a technically well crafted film with high-quality performances that suffers from a contrived plot and mostly one-dimensional characters. There is nothing particularly striking or innovative in the film's visual style either. It certainly is not worthy of the title of Film of the Year.<br/><br/>If you are looking for films that explore the consequences of human interaction on a deeper level you may want to try 21 Grams which, while relentless and more complicated, is much deeper. You may also want to check out Magnolia, a film that is not only a deeper character study but a greater artistic achievement, both visually and emotionally."

","I tried to ignore the voice in my head not to rent it. I had heard from multiple sources that ""Crash"" was the worst film to ever win Best Picture--worse than even ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" back in 1952. Yet it had won Best Picture, which must mean something. I fished out my rental card.<br/><br/>Minutes into the start of the film, I knew what I was in for: a narcissistic celebration of the city where the film takes place--LA. No, not the LA of reality, where human beings transcend stereotypes and live in a three dimensional world of development and originality. Fact is, LA really has no ""reality."" Norman Mailer once wrote that the city, America's grandest suburb, appears to have been built by some self-perpetuating television studio.<br/><br/>Like the city itself, ""Crash"" is a made-for-TV spectacle filled with character archetypes, gun-crazed hysterics, and clangy car wrecks. It is an accurate depiction of the psychic space many Angelinos are proud to call home--the stupefying, stifling world of television.<br/><br/>Defenders argued that ""Crash"" has one 'fresh' element: it at least acknowledges the fact that we live in this stereotypical, flat world. Yet ""Crash"" does not rebel against this world--it perpetuates it. Instead of challenging its own moviescape, ""Crash"" keeps indulging us with more car bangs, more flat archetypes, more cheap, overt racism. Look out, Fox TV.<br/><br/>In March 2006, on behalf of a society increasingly defined by such pulp, the celebrity class paid its dues: it awarded best picture to this shrill, depressing film. ""We are all racists"" they said, in an attempt to mask their glossy pulp with banal condescension. This film is a great step toward making their generality a reality.<br/><br/>Some critics lamented that Crash's Oscar victory spelled the end of the Academy's ""relevance."" Hardly. The win heralds a new era at the Academy. The Oscars, once a serious, national ceremony celebrating the art of individual expression, has fully succumbed to the televised suburbs. The narcissistic celebrities of LA no doubt toasted their win with martinis. Meanwhile, a nation that used to be known for its individuality, intelligence, and love, continues to lose."
"crazyrabbits","3","14","22","14 March 2006"," Paul Haggis must have sold his soul to the Devil...
","When I watched the film Crash (which, if you haven't seen it already, is about the lives of people who are affected by racism in Los Angeles), I realized something. No, it wasn't that everyone is a racist. No, it wasn't that everyone as a stereotype. And no, it wasn't that the film beats you over the head with it's foolishly simple message. Instead, I realized that this film accomplishes ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. Forget about whether this film has any soul or not, because it doesn't. At the end of this film, the audience is no better off than when they first started watching it.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the characters. For one thing, almost every person in this film is a stereotype of popular cultures. Whether it be the racist white cop, the screaming and incoherent Chinese crash victim, the two African-American men who rob people (and I'll get back to that in a second), the police partner with a heart of gold, the Latino man who everyone mistakes for a gangster, the cop who has to sacrifice his ideals to get ahead, or even the fat Italian mechanic, they are ALL shallow and predictable characters. There is absolutely no one in this film I can relate to. Everyone is a shell.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the plot. Here's an example of the story: two African-American men are eating out at a fancy L.A. diner. They complain about how people are treating them unfairly, that they shouldn't be judged based on their skin color, and then they proceed to rob people at gunpoint. Gee, thanks for setting back race relations hundreds of years, guys. And what about the racist cop who molests an African-American woman for no reason, then proceeds to save her life the next day, and realizes the error of his ways. Would you like me to beat the ""racism is bad"" symbolism into your head some more? How about the cop who is forced to conform to a white person's beliefs to get a promotion at work? Still not enough? And then there's the Persian storekeeper who goes after a person who he supposedly thought robbed his store, and shoots a gun at him in broad daylight? Christ, the plot is so messed up that it's not even funny.<br/><br/>That brings me to another area of the movie: the characters. You tell me, when have you ever seen a white police officer launch into a rant about ""you people"" to an African-American customer service woman? Or when have you ever heard a policemen talk about black people like they are a nuisance? No one in this film talks like a normal person. It's ALL hackneyed dialogue designed to elicit a response from us, the viewers. Even the character behavior is all out of wack. As I said before, who talks about the mistreatment of their race and then proceeds to act in a stereotypical representation of their culture? Who decides to go out in broad daylight to shoot a man in front of many witnesses, and how do you not realize you were firing blanks? Better yet, why would you practically molest a woman in the middle of a crowded street? And there's even the part where a car chase occurs, and no one even bothers to fill out any paperwork or anything. These characters are all hopeless idiots.<br/><br/>And then there's the ending, where we find out one of the carjackers is suddenly Don Cheadle's brother, despite the fact that we haven't seen anything that proved he was even related to Don Cheadle's character, RYan Phillipe's character shoots a man and leaves the scene of the crime even though he is a police officer, the Persian shopkeeper honestly believing he had been saved by ""an angel"" when he shot blanks at a defenseless child (he was really shooting blanks, or was he too stupid to realize this?), people talking while a person is singing in the background(???), Chinese illegal immigrants stuck out in the streets, and hey, just for good measure, we find out that the African-American female receptionist is also a racist. Not to mention that it's SNOWING IN LOS ANGELES. Champ job, guys.<br/><br/>This film is a tired, preachy mess that is designed to pander to the lowest common denominator. Don Cheadle says in the beginning of the film that everyone is disconnected. What a load of bull that is. We only have twelve stereotyped characters making stupid decisions and interacting in idiotic ways.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: This type of issue has been dealt with far more effectively in other (and better) films. Maybe you've heard of a little film called ""Do The Right Thing""? I'm giving this film 3 stars for the acting. Other than that, it's tripe."

","I have no idea why this film got an Oscar, probably because it's about racism and it would be politically incorrect not to give it one, but in my opinion it's badly scripted and petty. Vague complaints about immigration ruining America, a nation built by immigrants flesh out plots about how nothing works out when you're black. It glamourises gang culture and militants and takes a typical 'every police officer is a racist' view. It does nothing new, seems to advocate opinions which were only relevant about 10-20 years ago and patronises the minorities it tries to defend; every black man is apparently a gangster and every Spanish immigrant is a desperate Catholic fanatic. It makes me cringe."

","The story of this movie deals with issues of prejudice and race in a rather crude and unlikely way. Characters are portrayed as ""two-sided"" rather than ""black-or-white"" which might have been a virtue, if it had been done in a half-way believable way. Unfortunately, the screenplay suffers from mediocre writing, and an improbable plot. It's unsubtle, done in a hit-the-viewer- over-the-head style, and betrays the writer's long background in television. Furthermore, the musical soundtrack is highly annoying and distracting. I suppose it's trying to create tension, which the writing fails to do. It's really hard to believe that this movie got a best-picture nomination.

Specifically, that was the dialog between the two men in the stolen SUV. It was so academically wooden. Especially when one is singing that country song and the other is giving a lecture on how hip hop is a white man conspiracy.

","If not for some good actors doing their best with a terrible script, this movie would only get one vote. But my oh my what a terrible script. All I could think is that Haggis went and saw Short Cuts and Magnolia and figured nobody else in the world did. During the snowfall scene I was thinking that he must have ran over-budget and couldn't afford frogs because the scene was so blatantly stolen from Magnolia, down to the Aimee Mann sound-alike playing in the background.<br/><br/>So many different things to hate about this movie, but the most obvious is the simplistic view of race relations in America. Quite frankly, I am amazed Haggis ever lived anywhere near L.A. The movie seemed like it was made by a high school student in North Dakota (no offense to anyone from North Dakota, just saying it's quite a ways, culturally and geographically, from L.A.) who decided to make a movie about race relations in L.A. based on what he learned from watching television."
"RunEba","3","17","28","18 August 2005"," what a depressing vision
","Crash is an uncomfortable film to sit through because the characters either speak, represent, or point out ugly things. Everybody is sad and grievance is connected to racial prejudice, insensitivity or self-centered ignorance, and the film is completely and utterly in your face about those elements that it soon becomes clear that this may be a reflection of mass psychology rather than reality. Ultimately, the film argues, everybody is a victim, and everybody is an aggressor, and that this is arrangement--though the social disconnect that comes with it is horribly depressing--is for the most part inevitable. In the closing shots of the film, as another Crash occurs, the tone is humorous. ""It's the sense of touch--we miss it so much that we Crash to each other just to feel something"" says Don Cheadle's detective. But by the end, formal miscalculation and a fair amount of cheese sort of taint any sense of touch the film may have temporarily accorded us.<br/><br/>For by refusing to deal with any of its threads at length and allowing us to merely glimpse the problem, ""Crash"" becomes merely a crash course in racial dynamics as Haggis sees it.. Everybody has a problem and the question of race is almost always on their mind. As the film opens, two women who get into a little car accident, one Hispanic and the other Asian, hurl racial insults at each other as soon as they step out of the car. This is Spike Lee anger but without the insight into progress. When Monte in The 25th Hour condemned and cursed out his fellow new yorkers in harsh racial terms there was the reminder that he was one of them and had the right to speak of them this way, but the characters in Crash declare their racist remarks in that embarrassing, in your face manner that modern social etiquette declares to be evil. Even full bloodied racists don't speak that way, and the truth is that people are more connected than Crash would have you believe, and when I say connected I don't mean in the 'crisscrossing paths' theme the film ineffectually tries to pull off. I mean it in the sense that people in the real world--of different races--get along or hide their hatreds better than Haggis would have you believe. There's a young Hispanic man in the film who functions solely to act as the victim of Prejudice--from a white woman and an Iranian man. Forget that the woman in question--given her high class pretensions--wouldn't speak that away about a minority in the presence of other people or that the Iranian's anger and racism are inexplicable and contrived. Instead, what you notice is that every moment the Hispanic dude is on the screen the film becomes a pure exercise in cheese and sermonizing.<br/><br/>Tough and uncomfortable questions are posed but, in trying to capture them from every perspective, the film undoes them. It is short but feels stuffed. Just as we're getting the hang of one character we're cut to another to the effect that all we get is an impression of the these people but never full understanding. It's these impressions Haggis is concerned with, the one note characters and the sudden transformations. The film's best and most powerful storyline (which could have served as the basis for a better film)--that involving the sexually molesting/racist cop and the two affluent black couple--is ruined by the clichéd Connected Fate Amongst Strangers theme Haggis insists on. The film has been compared to Magnolia because of this aspect, but whatever its shortcomings, Magnolia was gloriously and awesomely musical and operatic in its flow. Crash in comparison feels clunky. Rarely did I develop any strong attachment to one plot thread or rarely did I long to return to another because there's no respectable sense of flow and rhythm to the scenes. In retrospect more scenes between Matt Dillon'monster cop and Ryan Phillippe's hero would've been nice--in retrospect a closer examination of the racial politics black cops play would've been welcome, or perhaps a look into how the media prefers to portray blacks--but all these elements are raised but grace by, never touching us, and ultimately all Haggis offers is ham-fisted irony. Suddenly the monster cop becomes a hero through a courageous act halfway through the film and the cop we thought a hero becomes a monster through a terrible act. A better one: Ludicrous saving Thai slaves while affectionately referring to them as ""chinamen."" I walked out thinking the title was too apt"
"Voivod-2","2","9","13","26 February 2009"," Just about the most ham-fisted, beat-you-over-the-head-with-unsubtlety movie in history
","I saw Crash the other day. It features Matt Dillon as a corrupt cop who finger f**ks a black woman who he's frisking during an illegal search. Later, he heroically saves the same woman from a fiery death in an overturned automobile. Brilliant. Then there's a touching scene in which Ludicrous, a depraved thug, steals a van only to find out after having driven some distance that there are a dozen Cambodian refugees being smuggled in the back. While barreling down a dingy road in a bad part of town, the previously Machiavellian gangster has a sudden moral epiphany, and realizes what he must do in the name of truth. He cinematically furrows his brows and exhales with a sense of firmness and resolution, stopping the van on a scary LA sidestreet spattered with blood stains and graffiti. He opens the rear van doors to let out the frightened refugees, and with the gusto of a young boy releasing a box of caged pigeons, he gestures excitedly towards the streets as if to say, ""Go, my friends! You are free now, and the world is at your command!"" The huddled mass of refugees and their shivering children cautiously but thankfully exit the van, inhaling the sweet nectar of their newfound freedom, where they are free to roam the dark streets of a large metropolitan city where they have no money, can't speak the language, and have no place to live. Of course, you as the audience member, aren't supposed to think about that. Instead, you are treated to a heartwarming closeup of Ludicrous smiling and nodding his head knowingly. Implicit in this ham-fisted and nonsensical tale is that this hardened criminal now walks the path of righteousness in a city where corruption has otherwise strangled all semblance of humanity.<br/><br/>I was stunned by this ridiculous display, and quickly scanned the audience to determine whether everyone else in the theater was as baffled by this scene as I was. Instead I found many theater patrons fighting back tears. Jesus Christ."

"jordan2240","6","9","13","25 May 2007"," Watched it Twice - Still not Convinced
","I first saw and commented on this film in 2005, before it won the best picture Oscar. I did not think it deserved the high rating it had on this site at the time. While I found it very watchable and never boring, I thought, like many, it had contrived extreme situations in an effort to beat us over the head with the message that racism is bad. The term ""After School Special"" has been used by a number of reviewers, and that's exactly what came to mind upon my first viewing. Some time after it won the Oscar, and after having discussed the film with one of his teachers, my high-school-aged son decided to give ""Crash"" a look, so I decided to watch it with him to validate or rescind my previous opinion. While a second viewing revealed that some of the situations were perhaps not as extreme as initially perceived, I still came away thinking there were too many flaws for this to even be considered a best picture, much less win it.<br/><br/>There is the scene early on where the cops pull over the black couple, and Dillon's character claims he saw them doing a sex act. Uh, is he supercop, with x-ray vision that can see through metal and fabric? He saw nothing other than a woman pop up and appear in the passenger seat. Sure, we know what the implications are, but she could just as easily have been picking something up that she'd dropped on the floor. None of the characters seemed to question this.<br/><br/>If you were making a purchase in a store and the owner insulted you, particularly with racial slurs, are you going to give him your business or get your money back and go elsewhere? Is there only one gun store in LA? The dialog surrounding the first carjacking scene was silly. A black man argues that the body language of white people indicates they perceive danger when in the vicinity of African Americans, then goes on to prove the perception is valid. Later on in a discussion with her husband, Sandra Bullock's character indicates she was in fact afraid that night, then goes on to imply that her husband should have realized that and done something to prevent the carjacking. What should he have done I wonder, say ""hey guys, please don't do anything bad to us, seeing as how you're black and all."" The scene between the locksmith and Turkish store owner where the owner kept insisting the locksmith was trying to cheat him by not replacing his door was something straight out of Monty Python.<br/><br/>And on and on.<br/><br/>Again, a watchable movie, but one with too many flaws to be considered Oscar-worthy. I don't know what picture should have won the best picture Oscar in 2005, but I definitely don't think it was this one."
"ReelReal","Null","9","13","18 April 2007"," contrived, racist melodrama ... with good intentions
","I know that there are many who love ""Crash"", and who would take offense to any discrediting of this film. I'd ask that they take a closer, open-minded look. I believe that the film was so greatly praised and received only because there is a lack of any real in depth discussion about the topic and many people wanted to like and praise this film before they ever saw it. But, let's look at the characters.<br/><br/>The character that stands out the most for a majority of the audience is that of Officer Ryan, played convincingly by Matt Dillon. This character is racist, not only in thought but in action. And, with the power his badge gives him, he is allowed to get away with practicing his racism without immediate consequence. We see him commit the heinous act of sexually abusing a woman. To make the act more deplorable, he uses it to not only hurt and debase the woman, but to emasculate her husband who has to watch, knowing that he could be jailed or even killed were he to step in. The ramifications of something like this are barely touched upon in the film, but I think any reasonable person can agree that this act was deplorable with long reaching effects.<br/><br/>As the film goes on we find out that this man is taking care of an ill father. This is supposed to give the audience a feeling of compassion for this man. Later, in what is one of the most contrived scenes I've seen in a movie that has reached this status, the officer has the chance to save the same woman he victimized from possible death due to a car accident and an impending explosion. He is redeemed.<br/><br/>Wait. A police officer DOES HIS JOB, so he is redeemed for a CRIME that destroys the life and self esteem of this woman. So, a racist of this level, in this position, should be excused because there is good and bad in everyone , and we don't know what this man has to go through in his life at home. Only someone who has never been affected by this sort of racism would dare try to redeem this guy in such a way. (And yes, redemption was the obvious goal.) Lives are changed and destroyed by instances like the one in which he molested this woman. Some communities are in dishevel, in part, because even the majority of the community who are good citizens are more afraid of police abusing their power than they are of the illegal criminals. There are deep issues within these men, and we need to see this character come to terms with them or know that he will continue to destroy lives.<br/><br/>Next, there is Sandra Bullock's character. She represents an upper middle class woman who has an ingrained fear of young black men, as many do. Still, judging by this film, you certainly can't blame her. After all, her fear was confirmed when she was carjacked by the same men she feared. She even had a monologue where she admitted that she was afraid that night, but she didn't want to look like a racist so she said nothing. Then, she's jacked. Message? I won't go through every character, though there is a skewed point of view about every one. But, there is one more character that I must mention.<br/><br/>Ludicrous plays a character named Anthony. This guy was a carjacker. (I'm not complaining about the thug black character because I understand the reason for that character in the film.) What was appalling to me is how this writer/director, who wanted to show redemption in everyone, chose to use the scenario of human trade in the situation of Anthony. Anthony's redemption comes when we see that he doesn't take money, from an obvious scumbag, for a truck load of human beings. What??? What kind of monster is Anthony that we would believe he would have sold human beings to this guy? It was simply human to make the right decision. It's as if the audience was to think so lowly of this young black man as to think he would do such and egregious thing. Nothing in his character showed him to be that kind of person. But being a young black man we were supposed to think him that monstrous.<br/><br/>What's the message? This movie says to me that: racism by white people is either warranted or should be excused, because after all they really are good people; people of color, even professionals, have an uncontrollable rage in them that will cause them to kill (store owner) or lash out until they are killed (Terrence Howard's character) themselves; and yes, young black men may be criminal, but maybe they are not the absolute monsters that some believe ... just watch your stuff.<br/><br/>I've heard Paul Haggis speak on more than one occasion. I believe that he had the best intentions at heart when he made this film, and it was those intentions that likely attracted Don Cheadle as producer and much of the cast. The problem is that Haggis, like most of us, has his own internal racism and preconceived notions. Instead of recognizing that and realizing that he could not likely write a balanced film on the subject by himself, he took on a task too big for most to handle. He should have either written a film that was intentionally from a white man's point of view, or collaborated on the film with writers from varying backgrounds in order to truly get a more balanced view. He had such an opportunity with this film. And unless his goal was the numerous awards bestowed in largest part by other white men with his point of view, he missed the boat."

It will suggest that maybe we need to put ourselves in someone else's shoes before we judge them. It shows us that sometimes good people do bad things and bad people do good things. Oh, and guns are bad, too, mmmkay? All of these sentiments are well and good. However, they are presented in a manipulative, preachy and not very plausible way. I suppose ""Crash"" is thought-provoking if you have never thought about racism before. If your head hasn't been buried in the sand for the past 10-20-100 years, however, you may be bored by the story and the plot twists (many of which you will see coming).

","Goodness knows it's ground that is well trodden - Short Cuts and Magnolia to name but two meandering LA multi-character tales - but it's not far off a remake of Lawrence Kasdan's racially themed Grand Canyon (yes, there's even a movie producer character). So it needs a lot to stand out, but a ludicrously contrived plot and ludicrously contrived characters put paid to that. Least convincing are two black friends who talk in loud passionate political debate (one militant, one reasoned), before pulling out guns on white passers-by. What, in God's name, is THAT all about?

","Haggis' directorial debut is a powerful and thought provoking look at a slice of LA life. In some ways, with its multi strands, it reminded me of some of Altman's ""Nashville"". The film successfully pulls all the strands together to make some pertinent points about different races fearing and misunderstanding each other without resorting to platitude too much.<br/><br/>On the flip side I found it schematic, too reliant on coincidence and frequently implausible (it would seem that there are only 5 cops including Officers Dillon and Phillipe in the whole of LAPD). At some points the film begins to bow under the weight of its own ambition - I would usually say that is a good thing, but here I felt that less incident would have given the characters more space to breath and come alive for the viewer. At times I felt that the characters moved from interesting 3D portrayals to screenwriters mouthpiece and this distanced me from an otherwise powerful film We need intelligent and provocative cinema and, in many ways, Crash delivers but I still think that it has been overrated by an audience desperate for something more than the usual popcorn fare"

However Crash managed to ruin of of this for me. Crash is an exercise in self-righteousness, pretentiousness, and pseudo-liberal elitism that is oh-so-common in Hollywood.<br/><br/>As is common in ensemble casts, Crash involves interconnected story lines as characters weave in and out of each other's lives. However, in Crash, this becomes tired and repetitive very quickly. From the beginning we are shown incident after painful incident of blatant prejudice and racism, perhaps effective the first time or two, but eventually is just disconcerting. In Haggis' world, everyone has extreme racial biases and exhibits then all the time. Yes, we all, to a point, harbor bias, but 99% of us show it in a not so overt and many times subconscious way. Crash is completely lacking in subtlety.<br/><br/>Cliché abounds as we are forced, rather quickly, through the series of events that eventually leads us to a muddled and self-righteous conclusion. I left the theater feeling offended and indignant. Crash was not thought-provoking, it was though-enforcing.<br/><br/>I was very happy with four of the five Best Picture nominations. All but Crash. Why, oh WHY is Crash there, when so many other films are being snubbed in the name of self-satisfaction (The Squid and the Whale)?

It was very predictable, for me at least, especially when the characters are ""forced"" to interact with each other trying to show how they have changed, or not changed for that matter. There were a few interesting developments I did enjoy, but over all I was very disappointed with the movie. That said I am sure many people will like Crash.

I happened to watch 'Crash' twice in the past year and I don't think it's a better movie. If you happen to like sensational, unrealistic racism tension, that's your business. But being a minority myself, I found that movie insulting and stereotyping on every single race it depicts. There is nothing encompassing about it. The story line about the black guy let off a bunch of filthy Asians in the back of a van right in the middle of the Chinatown is so unrealistic to the degree of being ridicule. Is that still how Americans see Asian people today? That we are just some helpless souls need a scum bag loser black person to liberate us for his personal redemption? How am I supposed to react or reflect on a movie in a name of 'takes the discussion of racism in America in a direction it has not gone before in the movies'? And you are wondering why some critics considered it as ""the worst film of the year,""?"

","This film has to be a contender for least deserving Best Picture winner of all time. If only those cowboys in Brokeback Mountain hadn't been so, well, gay...<br/><br/>It tackles the issue of racism in American society with all the insight of a bad high-school essay. Some whites are prejudiced against blacks and think they're all criminals, but then some really are criminals. And some blacks are prejudiced against whites. But then some whites aren't very nice. etc. etc. When the film finished with an incidence of racism between a Latino and a black character, I realised that deep down, inside of us, we really are all the same. Beautiful.<br/><br/>As ever for a Hollywood movie, it can't conceive of political issues outside of the personal. Thus, the racism of Mat Dillon's cop is explained in terms of his own father's experience rather than as an expression of any kind of structural prejudice in American society.<br/><br/>One can only imagine the level of self-congratulation which must have been felt by all those involved. That's racism sorted. Now how about a nice movie showing how much we care about those gays? Just mind that there's no sex between men though. That really kills your Oscar chances."

This film has enough coincidences for 20 movies.<br/><br/>Hardly any of the characters in the film are less than totally despicable. They're all hateful. Matt Dillon's cop is not only a bigot but a sick bigot as well. When he pulls over a couple he needlessly frisks the woman in a manner that is actually an assault Yet the film has the audacity to excuse his behavior, and he is never punished for it, because of some lame explanation about how his father was run out of business because of affirmative action. Somehow the scriptwriter is saying that he's a bigot because of affirmative action and that is okay. What a bunch of hooey. The Persian store owner is also hateful, about as abusive as they come. I found myself wishing these clods would get what was coming to them.<br/><br/>I feel that the screenwriter has violated the well-known principle of ""write what you know."" This man has no idea of the characters he writes about and he has no idea what it's like to be a person of color. His attitude actually seems Uncle Tom'ish and very condescending. <br/><br/>I have nothing against the actors in the film, they were good. But what terrible lines they were given. I feel sorry for them.<br/><br/>I guess the movie folks in L.A. think they did something good by giving this film an Oscar, to somehow show they are not racists.

I wouldn't have minded a movie about racial tension if it wasn't so cheesy and overacted, when watching Crash I thought I was watching that one scene in mystic river where Sean Penn was screaming for his daughter for 2 plus hours (but then again you folks here may have liked that), I think if Robert Altman had seen this movie he may of had a stroke which wouldn't have allowed him to show up at the Oscars for his achievement award.<br/><br/>When Paul Haggis was described as a ""force of nature"" I almost broke my jaw yawning. Million Dollar baby was pretty good but I don't really like womens boxing or Hilary Swank getting her face bashed in...<br/><br/>Anyway I say this impartial to any other Oscar nominated movie...Let's just be honest with ourselves this was just a bad movie that carried a message few have addressed on the silver screen!"

Paul Haggis sat his pompous royal Hollywood butt on a pedestal made of melted gold Oscar statuettes above me and told me: This is how it is, and it is no other way. I see this disturbing trend in films a lot these days (re: Steven Soderbergh, Darren Aronofsky, Alejandro Innaritu), I mean I can feel their perceived superiority over the viewer, instead of engaging them with a serious debate, which each of these films act under the guise of being open to, they closed the argument long ago in their heads.

However, why Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon signed on to this film is beyond me.<br/><br/>This is hack screen writing, straight off prime time network television. Not too surprising when you consider Paul Haggis's resume includes ""Who's the Boss?"", ""The Facts of Life"", and ""Diff'rent Strokes"".

"vmkladylazarus","3","11","17","2 April 2006"," Crash Has Little Impact
","I found Paul Haggis' Crash (no, not the kinky and perverse car wreck fetish film of the same name) to be a routine look at racism and prejudice in Los Angeles with some genuinely touching moments. It had an interesting ensemble cast and reminded me of a patchy Robert Altman film because the story is told in an episodic series of vignettes. Race hate, police brutality, and prejudice has been thoroughly examined in cinema before, more successfully so in Matthieu Kassovitz's La Haine (Hate). Crash just reeks of ""can't we all just get along?"" preachiness. Throughout the entire film, I couldn't help thinking this was a 'message movie,' with all the complexity and character dimension of an after-school special. With its stereotypical cookie cutter characters, Crash tirelessly beats us over the head with its anti-racism themes, as if we hadn't figured it out in the first ten minutes. What's really frustrating is that this movie had the potential to be so much more. Instead of offering any new insight into the diversity of cultures in America's 'melting pot,' it reinforces its stale stereotypes into action, so that they are mere puppets serving to teach us all a lesson. Thandie Newton and Don Cheadle give fine performances, as ever, but they have so little screen time we don't get to care too much about their characters. They're just there to represent their race and then disappear once the script has discarded them. With its depiction of everyone trashing each other and the tag line, ""You think you know who you are. You have no idea,"" what exactly is Crash trying to say? Is it implying that everyone is bigoted, full of hate, and glaring with suspicion at our neighbors? That we'd blame the Middle Eastern grocery clerk if our receipt read wrong? Because I tend to disagree. I think this film came out at just the right time. After 9-11, it's very topical. A lot of people are going to praise it simply because of it's seemingly positive message of tolerance in a world constantly waging war. I was highly surprised when the Academy Award nominations were announced because I considered this a very minor film. I think it could have done better. I do like to give credit where it's due, so I will say Crash had some very winning scenes: the intense moment where bad cop Dillon pulls Newton out of the flaming wreckage of her car and she is forced to entrust her life to him, and the story about the little girl protecting her daddy from the bullet. Other than that, it read like a propaganda pamphlet for an overzealous activist group with no real aim or solution."
"ihash","6","11","17","19 March 2006"," Superficial
","Crash is in essence a glossed up remake of Grand Canyon. The premise is the same: a racially diverse group of people in Los Angeles who live separate lives are thrown together by coincidence. But for these coincidences, their lives would never intersect. Every interaction in Crash is racial in a way that hits the audience over the head with the movie's theme. Racism in Crash is a matter of not being treated with sensitivity. People are meant to endure the ""tryanny"" of being insulted. The people in Crash, like Grand Canyon, live lives of unremitting grimness that seems gratuitous. The movie suggests that if only people would be more racially sensitive, life would not be so grim. The oppression of having to actual endure racial insensitivity is unintentionally juxtaposed with lives that don't seem that bad. I definitely got the impression that the film writer (who can stand in for most of the Hollywood establishment) projects his own personal racial isolation on the world at large. This accounts for the film's superficial take on the subject. People who actually interact with people from other racial and socio-economic backgrounds know that life is not so gratuitously race-obsessed. The Magnolia-like editing of the film means that the characterizations in the film are not nuanced. We see only a sliver of their lives. The one exception is Dillon's character, but none of the other actors did anything remarkable. The film does have some decent plot twists. The film is well done, but is style over substance. A decent film, but not an Oscar-worthy one."
"eme-9","5","11","17","7 March 2006"," Candidate for Most Overrated Movie in History
","First, I had no problem watching Crash, didn't take a bathroom break and forget to first turn off the DVD player (a sure sign I'm not enjoying the feature presentation). I was very impressed with Sandra Bullock's performance especially. Don Cheadle, as always, was also excellent. No actor's performance in Crash, in fact, can be faulted. The problem is: poor ""STORY"". No critic I know of has looked at Crash from the perspective of STORY.<br/><br/>The multiple vignette concept, as seen in Magnolia, Short Cuts, Happiness, and various other efforts, is a way of using, and maximizing fallow fiction material without having to properly develop any single story. As a substitute for a single well-developed story and its appropriate ""subplots"", the vignette movie-writer attempts to ""unify"" the vignettes--for example, the players are all people living in the SAME city, which isn't quite enough, is it? but that's Crash--and this ""unity"" is extremely difficult for the writer to effect without resorting to puerile contrivances, and forced drama -- drama which seems to be controlled, not by the characters' choices, but from ""above"", by a ""deus ex machina"", the Greeks called it, whether it's a chorus of chanting Fates, or splatting frogs, or a writer pushing an agenda and using puppets (characters) to speak for him, the contrivance explains ""everything"". No ""plot"", that is, no story, is necessary.<br/><br/>The various vignettes in Magnolia are ""unified"", finally, when frogs rain down on everyone, no exceptions, in the stories. There's William Macy sitting in his car while frogs splat on the windshield. No absurdist philosophy can justify this BS, this, to quote myself, ""puerile contrivance"" of an ""ending"", which demeaned the rest of the movie. As other posters said, the actors in Magnolia --Cruise, and Phil S-Hoffman--were excellent, and it was just as worthy of winning an award as Crash was, which is to say, neither was.<br/><br/>The ""unifier"" in Crash was ... well, everyone lives in the same city. And, oh yeah, people will sometimes CRASH into one another to get a little ""contact"". That's the Crash agenda. The internal ""logic"" of one vignette, Matt Dillon's, is shoddy, garbage writing, false. It ""just so happens"" the only cop on hand to rescue a woman in her burning SUV is, guess who?--the cop who just ""molested"" her. What a coincidence. Let's teach everybody a lesson in ... melodrama. Set-ups and (moralistic) ""punch-lines"" passed off as plot. Pick any story-line in Crash, Sandra Bullock's, for example, or Matt Dillon's,and imagine it fully developed into one great STORY. <br/><br/>To all but worship Crash as some sort of paean to racial ""truths"", should be a felony. Crash looks and talks ""funky"" enough, but it's loaded with a ""politically correct"" subtext. Speaking of which, I've had my fill of that sanctimonious monomaniac, Oprah, going goo-goo over this movie and the players, read: black players, in it. Gimme a STORY already!"
"omarramonmuniz","5","6","8","17 October 2007"," spoon-fed drama
","Crash is not nearly as good as everyone has hyped it up to be and here's why: The film is filled with drama and it's mostly forced. What I mean is, the film abandons logic so we conveniently find characters facing the most dramatic, heart-wrenching scenarios imaginable. Of course, this ignites emotion out of the audience, but the drama is spoon-fed and the reason is because it doesn't hold true to story and, in some cases, character. In simpler terms, once you discover the film's dramatic pattern, the characters and story mostly feel fake. And consequently, you may realize that what you're watching isn't a true and real story, but an obvious attempt by the filmmakers to bury the audience in drama so they have no choice but to shed a tear. In addition, most of the movie feels like a music video. These filmmakers feel like the only way they can successfully weave together this large cast of characters without confusing the audience is by adding music to most of the film. Camera movements, acting and editing are all dictated by the music. That's when you know you're watching a music video. Plus, the music is not very good. The soundtrack makes you want lay inside an empty bathtub and down a bottle of aspirin tablets. All in all, the movie is full of silly coincidences that audiences mistake for good screen writing. It's a film that banks on America's vulnerability to films on racism. However, with all that said, I don't want to come across as Mr. Negativity. Here are some good qualities about the film that get lost in its desperate attempts to spoon-feed its audience: Performances by Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, and Terence Howard; their characters were the best written of all in the film and, despite having their characters flung into unrealistic situations, they managed to turn in believable performances. Also, keep an eye out for the relationship between Bullock's character and her housekeeper. This portion of the film tends to be overlooked because it's the least tear- jerking, but it may be the best presented. And, despite the films flaws, it attempts an important and somewhat original message. That's more than I can say for most modern-day Hollywood films."

The interpretations were mostly really good also.<br/><br/>But then I think he lost it because he tried to give it too much that tragedy feeling which had no reason to be since the tragedy was already there.. so he did that ridiculous last scene ""à la Magnolia"" with the song playing loud and clear and showing all the characters in their suffering or feeling better about themselves..

","I must admit that I didn't run out to see this film during its cinematic release in Australia, and only ended up viewing it on Cable TV. My main criticism of Crash is that its theme (racism) is too obvious. Subtly is an art form in cinema and difficult to achieve. Crash presents a view of Los Angeles as a city full of racism, but to its credit, examines all of the characters and gives them depth. The racist cop is also represented as a caring son, the 'liberal' minded cop ends up perpetuating all that he hates. However, despite the relatively interesting dichotomies in many of the characters, I still had difficulty with the 'blatent' nature of the theme. There were basically no scenes that didn't re-in force the basic tenet of the film, leaving the viewer with a feeling of being slapped around the face by the end. Maybe this was the aim? Maybe American culture has become so obsessed with racism, that these kinds of representations are necessary in a film of this kind. Despite my hesitations, I still felt that Crash has a lot to offer with a fantastic ensemble cast. I loved the Iranian shop owner and the Latino locksmith and the interplay that racism isn't always white vs everyone else. That racism is a multi-layered reality and, despite its abhorrence, may be easier to understand, just not easier to forgive."

","The performances are really strong especially in the face of dialog that has to remind the actors of Days of Our Lives more than any day in their real lives. <br/><br/>Every single person in every scene is a racist and/or a bad guy. Los Angeles is a very racially tolerant place (if you don't think so, I invite you to travel anywhere else and see how much you know about racial tolerance). You would be considered a nut case for making comments in public the way many of the characters do. Some people may make comments in private to friends, but the friends would consider them outside the mainstream for many of the remarks made in this film. Another example is with LAPD, where officers are thought of as under-supervised and half crooked. But even LAPD is portrayed in an unbelievable way. Leave aside that LAPD wouldn't patrol with 2 guys if they were in the area shown in the movie, it would be one, and they would not be both white if it were two. More to the point, if an LAPD officer were going to grope a girl he had just stopped, it would be anyone but the character in question. Officers would be, if anything, afraid of touching a black female if she were a member of the media especially. A mere accusation from such a person would trigger 3 investigations: internal LAPD, FBI for civil rights violations, and the news media. LAPD officers who have been arrested in the past show a pattern of abuse of power, but it's against gang members and drug dealers who have no interest in calling the police to report that their illegally obtained cash has been stolen along with the drugs they've been selling. If the filmmakers had thought to use that, it would have been more interesting and damning of LAPD than anything they presented. The movie is just asinine and anyone who takes it seriously is being taken for a ride."

The characters are all left with a 'lesson' learnt by the end of the film, and the audience are thus left with something to make them think...or does it? Because we've seen this all before haven't we? the racist resentful cop, the successful black director who doesn't quite 'fit in' with his white counter parts, the intelligent and yet thieving black youths from the 'hood'...lets not forget the overly tattooed Hispanic locksmith.<br/><br/>The racial and cultural stereotypes, are cringe worthy and patronising in equal doses. Whats worse is the way in which they are represented to us in a way which seeks to make us question our own outlook on life.

","Crash (2004) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Various characters in L.A. go through various racial situations before they all ""crash"" in the end. I'm really not sure if I should give this film a BOMB rating or four stars so I'll just settle on a two star rating. There's no denying that there's some truly remarkable stuff in this film but in the end I couldn't help but feel there wasn't any point to this movie. Black people are thugs. White people are scared of blacks for no reason. Foreigners can't speak English. Racist whites molest black women. Blacks are ashamed to be black so they act white. What the hell was all of this suppose to mean in the end? There's no doubt racism is still a thing in this world but good God this film pushes everything to the limit. I'm sitting here typing this and I really don't know what to say. I watched this movie with the girl I mentioned a few posts back and afterwards we went out to get a drink and discuss the film. She didn't know what to say either. As with the screenplay, this write up will probably be all over the place but that's where this film left my mind.<br/><br/>I had a very hard time taking anything in this film too serious because everything is just so over the top. The racial stuff in this film are more make belief than anything we'd see in a science fiction film and I'd say even Planet of the Apes is more realistic than this thing. Writer/director Paul Haggis writes a screenplay that is constantly preaching at the viewer and hitting the viewer over their head with his ""message"", which is a message no one needs to hear. Everyone knows we shouldn't hate just because of the color of our skin. This crap was talked about with various Sidney Poitier films back in the more racist 60's so this film is doing nothing new. It's not saying anything new. Also, unlike those Poitier films, this one here doesn't work because of all the preaching.<br/><br/>Also, I read a few reviews that said the racists are redeemed in the end making this a very positive film but I've got to laugh at this as well. Not once did I feel I was watching a movie with characters but I saw all of these characters being pulled on a string. The screenplay shows us how ugly these racist people are and in the matter of one day they are peaceful and love all races. Again, bullshit. How long has racism been a part of this world? Since Christ walked the streets, right? And now this message film is redeemed because all these racists turn the other way over a day? Another factor that really bothered me is something I hate in a lot of movies. It seems if a movie wants to be cute they get a cute little kid under the age of 5 to say a cuss word. This makes everyone in the crowd smile saying how cute it was to see a cute kid say a bad word. Talk about hypocrites but back to this film. The locksmith has a cute little daughter and the director jerks the viewer by giving her several cute little speeches, daddy tells her a cute story and then the director has us believe something bad happens to the kid. Again, just more preaching.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about the movie is its cast, all of which deserve Oscar nominations (with the exception of Sandra Bullock). Matt Dillon really steals the show as the racist cop and Terrence Howard really caught my eye as well. Of all the redemption stories the one dealing with Dillon is the only one that works because we get to know him the best of the group even though he's one of the worst characters here. The scene with the overturned car was very powerful and the ""message"" here got across very well without having to preach.<br/><br/>I've written the above and so far have taken three smoke breaks because I'm trying to think of more to say but can't. I really, really, really wanted to love this film but it just rubbed me the wrong way. I'm smart enough to know a white cop shouldn't molest a black woman and I don't need a film preaching to me about that. In 2005 we look back at dozens of films from the 1910s-1940s and call them racist in a bad way. I'm curious to know how people are going to look at films like this one in the year 2085."

I don't like having someone else's social ideas jammed down my throat, to be honest.

","As has been stated, there have been many incendiary films made about race and prejudice in America, notably Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing."" There have also been numerous acclaimed pictures about the urban African-American experience made by filmmakers such as John Singleton (""Boyz in the Hood"") and the Hughes Brothers (""Menace II Society""). There have also been numerous films made with large ensemble stories and multiple intersecting characters, especially in the films of Altman (""Nashville"" ""Short Cuts"") and P.T. Anderson (""Magnolia""). And thus, pureeing all of the aforementioned together with some heavy white liberal guilt, you get ""Crash."" ""Crash"" has some outstanding acting and a clever structure, but it's also too tidy and too easy--the stereotypes presented on screen are too often just that: stereotypes. Moreover, the film reduces almost every character to their worst instincts and racist impulses (even when doing so defies rationality), and the film thus sacrifices logic and depth for scenes of emotional confrontation, hysteria, and shrillness. (The film's prejudices, interestingly, revolve almost exclusively around race, and never touch on religion or sexuality.) Worth seeing for some knockout work from Cheadle, Dillon, Newton, Howard, and others, but it's a darn shame that Spike Lee's oeuvre doesn't get the respect it deserves (nor, for that matter, did Altman's--at least not from the Oscars) while those who should know better slobbered over this picture. (Several of my white liberal friends loved it and spoke of it as being ""SO important""; notably, several of my African-American friends hated it.) The highly mixed reviews worldwide that greeted this film when it came out are always going to follow it around like a stain, reminding folks that its bewildering current lionization (and the vitriol often simultaneously directed at ""Brokeback Mountain"") reveal more about prejudice than anything in ""Crash"" truly does. I'd be very interested, in a mirror of the Oscars, how many people really vote FOR ""Crash"" as opposed to voting AGAINST ""Brokeback."""
"DaveDiggler","6","7","10","8 August 2007"," A Burning Mess with a Touch of Beauty
","""Crash"" is a movie that has one character crashing into another. Several questions arise watching the film. I ask, is everyone in the world spewing hate-mongering statements 24/7 and looking at people who are of a different race and nationality as criminals, terrorists, or thugs? The film deals with far too prevalent acts of racism. These acts are not nearly as prevalent as they were 40 and 50 years ago in America, which is probably when this film should take place, but even then there would be one too many racists in this film. Not every person is filled with hate, but we get the impression that we are. ""Crash"" wants to be bold and outgoing on a touchy subject and does a good job in doing that with the actions of the characters, but ultimately it never gets to where it wants to be.<br/><br/>The only person that you get a feel for being 100% racist is Matt Dillon's character. After an inspiring act of humanity and selflessness from Officer Ryan it reaches its climax right then and there, half way through the film, and unfortunately never recovers until the final moments. This will be the first of many occasions where we see some good show through an evil character or some bad show through a good character. Veteran Police Officer Jon Ryan played by Matt Dillon gives an Oscar worthy performance. His performance ends up getting lost in the shuffle of the swinging door of one racist character after another and how we see them redeem themselves. His story along with the black couple that he comes to know on a personal basis like no other relationship you could ever imagine is truly some of the greatest work I have ever seen in film. We see the most volatile in man in one traffic stop from Officer Ryan then we see the most humane, noble, and heroic in an incredibly inspiring, emotional, and beautifully crafted rescue scene.<br/><br/>Each and every character goes through a transformation which is preceded by a crazy and unrealistic event that happens in their lives that gives them a new outlook on life and a new outlook on the people around them. The bad end up good and the good end up bad.<br/><br/>The film really misses on it racial slurs, but hits on all cylinders with its racial actions. The problem is that they didn't take it all that far. In all reality it's really lightweight stuff when you really listen to what they're saying with what they should or could be saying. Watch a Martin Scorsese film and then talk about racism. This movie tries to go all the way, but fails at the end of the day with the tone of the film not matching what we hear. It doesn't match what the characters are saying with what they're doing. They're supposed to be racist, but they speak in politically correct racism. Racism is no holds barred and this film is trapped in a 6X10 steel cage just waiting to explode.<br/><br/>There is just one too many people changing for the good. And one too many people changing for the bad. To symbolize this, it snows at the end (In LA) to show that people can change and that it's possible. That anything is possible; when in these cases virtually none of it is possible. If you can get past all this over the top stuff that really brings the film down you can see what the filmmaker is trying to portray; you realize this film is not about racism like I thought it was after the first time I watched it. It has much more to offer.<br/><br/>The second time I watched this film, the final images really jumped out at me. Maybe I had a better understanding, maybe I was watching closer, but we see all the characters looking out their windows, or out into the dark night, or out upon the city lights. We first see this with the newly resurrected Officer Ryan who is a changed man as he looks at a brightly lit Christmas tree in the city possibly resembling his future, but he still has a look of grief and sorrow for his actions on that same street that could make anyone sick. Then we see Daniel (Michael Pena) looking out his window after he nearly looses a loved one. We see him looking at the beautiful world in which he inhabits and the ugliness that he has seen as he wonders if that bullet from his past is still following him. He appreciates all that he could have lost and fears what he could lose.<br/><br/>We see the DA (Brendan Fraser) looking out his door just after he comes home. He looks out his window wondering if he's safe and questioning his purpose in life. Prior to this scene we see that he has more than just a working relationship with his black secretary, Karen, which his wife(Sandra Bullock) would surly oppose. Finally we see the city of LA as we just witness Anthony (Ludacris) change into a hero and Shaniqua get rear-ended by someone of a different background. She then spews a toned down racial epithet. Here we see the beautiful images of LA where mankind's most vile and heinous acts have been occurring, but we also see its great acts of heroism and humanity. We see that people can change. We also see that people are good hearted and everyone has good and bad buried in them. They just need to examine themselves, step back, take it all in, and just let go. The final message is that, maybe tomorrow everyone can find their way. The final shot reassures us that maybe there is hope amidst all these despicable acts because of all the great acts of humanity that we see from the despicable.<br/><br/>There's a lot to like, but it's just too heavy handed."
"skanemermaid","6","7","10","9 April 2007"," Good execution, but cannot rescue overwrought ideas
","That 'Crash' has earned tremendous stature and audience admiration is a given. To dismiss these accolades -- including the BP Oscar -- may indeed seem hubris. Perhaps the IMDb readers might even see a reactionary review behind all of this, an inability to accept race realities when held up to my face in a very, very large convex mirror. <br/><br/>This isn't the case.<br/><br/>""Crash"" views race through the wrong-end of the telescope: by staring at the business end, everything seems small yet intensely magnified, co-ordinated in microscopic ways in which features and elements all combine together. The crew behind 'Crash' should have flipped the lens around and take a broader picture.<br/><br/>I start by acknowledging the better treatment done on the same subjects by worthier and more inventive films. For example, 'Changing Lanes' covers pretty much the same territory (and could sue for plagiarism on a few counts) . . . chance encounters, released racial intentions, revenge tragedy, class struggle, and so forth. 'Changing Lanes' succeeded by having a more compelling plot and a tighter focus on two primary characters. Samuel L. Jackson's speech in the pub about his idea of a Tiger Woods commercial had more to say about African-Americans than all of 'Crash's' pseudo-meditations on hiphop culture combined. And what about 'Traffic'? Another panorama plot joining together disparate elements in search of a cure for the common cold of prejudice and drugs? Again, a film of wider premise, more nuanced readings of state and society, and a more profound picture of how prejudice connects to the economics of greed and destruction.<br/><br/>'Crash' desperately wants to outdo everything that comes before it. It wants to be 'Magnolia' and 'Mississippi Burning' at the same time, as well as out-spiking Spike Lee. Quite frankly, and I know people will get more annoyed here, but I thought the plot entirely contrived and manipulative. In its quest to be morally correct, it turns the reality of racism into a situational tour de force in which characters aren't people, but prejudices waiting to happen. Car accident. Do you immediately get out and shout racial epithets? Maybe. Maybe not. See Erik Lundegaard MSNBC article about how 'Crash' turns the subtleties of racial aggression into a children's book of cause and effect and turnabout is fair play. And, at the end of the day, racism can just disappear if, like Sandra Bullock, you have a Hispanic maid who's nice to you after you sprain your ankle. Ah, the solution at last!<br/><br/>Let's not get into the racism of this anti-racist movie: apparently Asians are all human smugglers and chow mein eaters. <br/><br/>And let's not question why a movie, so eager to depict the reality of gritty LA bigotry, has to assemble a multimillion dollar cast. Apparently we, as an audience, like our racists to have handsome air-brushed faces. Apparently, in a city as large as LA, the same cops turn up at the same traffic accidents. At least in 'Magnolia', the cinematography invites the audience to suspend belief as the jigsaw puzzle falls into place like tetris blocks. In 'Crash', it's just contrived. Jammed guns and fateful rear-enders.<br/><br/>And why can't we have a movie about racism that doesn't have gun fights, car explosions?<br/><br/>It seems to me that racism is real, and Paul Higgins has much to say about it . . . (do we need to get into a discussion about this all came about because his Porsche was carjacked? There's a study in the reality of class and prejudice right there . . .) Who can fault his intentions? I don't. This is a fine enough movie with plenty to say for itself. It is, however, an act of prejudice in itself that it won BP and displaced worthier, far gritter candidates, such as 'Brokeback Mountain'. But again that's another story . . .<br/><br/>'Crash' falters when it tries so, so hard to succeed . . . as a definitive statement, as a millennial manifesto of American history . . . as an exemplum and moral tale on the Face of Racism. It simply cannot carry its own self-importance, and the delicacies of such a complicated subject must give way. Race relations become situational conundrums, a venting of feelings, an inappropriate choice of words. But the magical weaving of the cinema will teach them all a lesson.<br/><br/>For a movie about the reality of racism, we end up with a mere diorama of bad language and nastiness, all delivered in the typical Hollywood vernacular.<br/><br/>'Crash', you're the Nobel Peace Prize of films, without the impact or a genuine social consciousness of change. You're a guilt-piece of bewilderment and redemption for suburban homes, their DVD players, and Brinks security systems."

I think Los Angeles is an area of 10-15 million and how could this movie so easily intertwine the 10 or so characters in this movie? Hollywood!!! Entertaining, but too much of a morality play. Perhaps a movie of this kind is best shown to an audience in some Podunk town in Alabama where they still think Whites and Blacks should live in separate environments.

","Crash is probably the best recent example of small-minded ""gimme an Oscar!"" Hollywood film-making. Not since watching films from the twenties have I seen such a movie that tries to pass one-note racial caricatures for characters. Ever since this movie came out, kids at my school have talked glowingly of this movie, calling it ""brave"" (believe me boys and girls, there is nothing brave about Hollywood film-making) and ""honest,"" and other phrases that only tell me that someone saw an ""indie"" (HA!) flick with a ""message,"" and, by God, it makes them ""smart."" There really isn't a lot to express in the way of the plot. The story consists of a bunch of intertwining plots about people who are all bigots (except the children, because kids are supposed symbolize innocence folks, it's good screen writing...right?), and they all end up learning their lesson (awwww) or at least experiencing an awakening to their ignorant ways. It's essentially a sloppier version of Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia, with lots and lots of sixties-era racism injected into it. In Paul Haggis' film, people only seem to think about one thing: how much they really, really hate those darn wetbacks, porch-monkeys, crackers, rag-heads, or (enter more racial slurs to your leisure here), and they're gonna let them all know, at every waking opportunity, how much they really despise them. Apparently, no one ever told Paul Haggis that we live in a really, really politically-correct age, and even the biggest bigots are usually forced to figure out other ways to express their racist beliefs, because if you express them the way people do in Crash, you get your ass kicked, and rightfully so. Don Cheadle's gloats on the phone about getting some white-woman action, when the girl he speaks of is right there naked underneath him (Yeah, you read that right). Ludicrous rants to Lawrenz Tate about how they are discriminated against by those black-hating honkies, right before they pull out their guns to rob a white couple of their SUV. Sandra Bullock bitches about how one of those dirty gang-banging no-good Mexicans is changing their lock, and how he's going to give the key to all his ""homies,"" right in front of their Mexican maid. Later, she discovers their maid is her only real friend. Awwww. Gee, that's deep folks. Seriously, it's almost too intentionally ironic and silly to even prove a point. Paul Haggis' film doesn't really reveal anything about race relations in America. Haggis' script uses every two-bit trick in the book to tug at your heartstrings, employing cheap, manipulative gimmicks at every point and turn to get you to squirt some tears. This probably stems from Haggis' background as a writer for TV sitcoms. It's pretty ironic that the guy who wrote for that show that many black people say is ""racist,"" Diff'rent Strokes, is now trying to lecture American audiences about tolerance. Oh, Haggis. Another thing about this movie that really grinds my gears is its complete and utter contempt for the audience, because only someone who thinks that everyone in the theater acts like his contemptible characters would make a film like this. This movie patronizes the audience every chance it gets. Granted, this movie might very well have been relevant...had it come out forty or fifty years ago. But it's a day late (well, several decades, but who's counting?), a dollar short, and more laughable than important. Since this movie won Best Picture at the Razzies, I mean, the Oscars, I've pretty much come to completely disregard anything the Acadamy gives nods to. Giving Best Picture to the Haggis-written (and equally cheap) Million Dollar Baby, but my God, has the Acadamy no shame? I know it's all politics, but when Dakota Fanning is on the board of people who have the final say on who gets what in the biggest film awards ceremony in the world, I'm going to have to just try my best to ignore the bastards."

","Over-hyped soap emotionalizes racial issues to the extreme so that it can reap recognition as an 'important film'. Basically shallow writing filled with implausible coincidences that would even embarrass Dickens. The script is crafted to focus on several intense characters with minimal screen time, thus insuring a bevy of supporting actor nominations. Crash is designed to accommodate consumers mesmerized by TV and its commercials; it caters to those whose minds superficially multitask on a lot while focusing in depth on nothing. No one leaves the film with a better understanding of the genuine understanding of the truth of racism and the realities of its effects.

The scope of Brokeback Mountain is beyond anything I can remember seeing on film - the cinematography, the script, the music, the theme and the acting. The movie still haunts me, though I saw it a month ago. Did you notice the symbolism of the shirts. When Ennis first finds them in the closet in Jake's childhood home Jack's shirt is on top and Ennis's is tucked inside. However, in the last scene when Ennis opens his own closet we see the shirts again but Ennis has reversed the order so that his shirt is on the outside to protect Jack's memory. And the last line.

","For all everyone talks about how remakes and sequels are ruining Hollywood, remakes and sequels are the only thing that kept 2005 from the absolute of the barrel. This is one of my least favorite years in all of film. A bloated and unnecessary King Kong remake is one of my favorite movies of the year. It's all pretty pathetic. I like to consider this year at best a rundown pit stop that people who are watching the Harry Potter, Star Wars, or Batman movies has to get gas in.<br/><br/>The crowning cherry on this disastrous sundae is the Oscars. Now, to their credit, because of their hatred of sequels and remakes, their pool of films this years was pretty small. There were not a lot of good Oscary movies. But come on, people. Crash? Crash?! It's not even a 2005 film. It's a 2004 film, and not even a Fall 2004 film. This was shown at TIFF in early September 2004.<br/><br/>But of course, that's not even getting into the film itself. This film angered me so much that I dropped my plans to finish the Lion King review I've been working on and reviewed this instead.<br/><br/>The premise isn't bad. It's about different people of different races in Los Angeles and how they react when their lives crash together. But a good premise does not a great film make. If it did, The Incredible would not be the only good Fantastic 4 movie we've ever gotten. I've seen films that tackle racial issues with nuance and complexity. This is not one of them.<br/><br/>I am not the only person who doesn't like this movie. Look up any list of Worst Best Picture Winners ever, and this movie will be right there near the top. But I don't think many people hate this movie. They find it boring, underwhelming, and pretentious, but they don't outright hate it. I do.<br/><br/>The only reason this film does not get an even lower score is because it is clear that some talented people worked on it. The acting is solid, and there are good shots. The chanting is a good idea, though it was overused tremendously. And there are some good ideas, though they are sloppily executed. That sideways compliment is the last good thing I'm going to say about the film.<br/><br/>The pacing is horrible. There's a flow, but there is no momentum. I honestly would be more interested in watching CNN for two hours straight. Some story lines could have, and should have, been written out in order to give others more time to develop. The first thing that comes to mind is Sandra Bullock's character. If she was gotten rid of, this film would lose nothing and gain a good deal of coherence and sense.<br/><br/>It sickens me when I read reviews calling this movie 'unflinching' or anything of the sort. I want to run over to all their offices, pick them up by their collars, and shout into their ears, ""You're being played."" This film is a glop of sentimentality disguised as a hard-hitting expose. This isn't racial tension as it really is. This is racial tension as it would be thought of by people who know nothing about it but a bunch of facts they read off the internet. This is like throwing a bunch of fridges off a rock wall and calling it a waterfall.<br/><br/>And I would be okay with all of that if the sentimentality felt in any way earned. There is more than one way to skin a cat, and there is more than one way to make a movie about racial tension. If you wanted to make a sappy movie, fine. There's nothing inherently wrong with that.<br/><br/>But there is something wrong with a movie that does not try in any way to make you connect with its characters. Sure, there's gestures and stories, but so what? CNN can give me that. If you want me to care what happens in your little story, make your characters jump out at me in a captivating way. I'd say the characters here are unlikable, but that would be giving them too much credit. Walter White is unlikeable, but he's one of the greatest characters in all of media. Vito Corleone is unlikable, but he's also one of the greatest characters in all of media. The characters are in this show are like a mishmash of every petty, presumptuous, faux-inspirational character you've ever seen. They're insufferable and so is this film. But don't worry; you won't have to mind it for too long.<br/><br/>Nothing in this movie holds any weight, and so you forget it very easily. After I finish this review, I'm probably never gonna think about it again. Even when I was halfway through the movie, I was struggling to recall what happened earlier because everything is so unremarkable.<br/><br/>If you're watching every Oscar winner, see it. Otherwise, run far away."
"StevePulaski","5","4","5","30 June 2012"," Ham-fisted and heavy-handed, and recites a message that becomes a lecture
","I was looking forward to my long-delayed viewing of Paul Haggis' Crash. I thought it would provide me with an experience along the lines of when I watched Falling Down, a breathtaking portrayal of societal arrogance, where I was riveted and infuriated for much of the film. Instead, Crash is a by-the-numbers film about America being a melting pot of racists, waiting to be set off in a cliché set up, and appears to be more of a stock lecture instead of a truly eye-opening film.<br/><br/>I must give respect and well-earned shock to the film for winning Best Picture, over critic/fan favorite, Brokeback Mountain. Its win was probably one of the biggest stuns next to when Annie Hall bested Star Wars in 1977, or when Forrest Gump stomped both Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption for the same title in 1994. Crash is definitely an interesting piece, setting its sights on the controversial nature of racism and its victims and alarmists, but manages to plod along in its runtime, rarely reaching heights of admirable status, and manages to be questionably exploitative and, dare I say, racist in itself.<br/><br/>The film follows numerous characters in a forty-eight hour period in Los Angeles where they are met with racial confrontations, have their personal outlooks and insights tested, and eventually, have their stories intertwined with one another in some way, shape or form, connected by the central focus; a car crash. Such characters are a black LAPD officer (Don Cheadle) who is long estranged from his mother, a white District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his spoiled-rotten wife (Sandra Bullock) whose car was hijacked by two young black men (Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges and Larenz Tate), a racist white police officer (Matt Dillon), who molests a black woman (Thandie Newton) right in front of her husband (Terrence Howard), a Hispanic locksmith (Michael Pena) trying to keep his family business straight, an uptight Persian immigrant (Shaun Toub), and an optimistic cop (Ryan Phillippe), who works with Matt Dillon's character.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, there are far too many underdeveloped characters here. The way we are greeted with them is awkward, too fast, and lacks much substance. In an ordinary anthology film with intertwining characters, take Adam Rifkin's criminally underrated and near-perfect film, LOOK for example, we spend enough time to get to know the characters, form opinions about them, and actually become intrigued and somewhat astonished at how they meet and engage with one another. Crash breathlessly tries to juggle a dozen loose stories and find creative ways for them to connect with each other that it doesn't have time to adapt its subjects into believable people. It's almost encouraging its own problem by stereotyping its characters.<br/><br/>The film portrays all of its characters as on-the-edge racists triggered by a fairly mild, forgivable, and misunderstood circumstance where every conclusion is jumped to and nobody is smart enough to think something over before acting. Perhaps Crash is trying to show us that that, specifically, is the problem, but it is gone about in such a ham-fisted, heavy-handed way that we know what the film is trying to say, but we simply don't care and are tired of being talked down to for close to two hours.<br/><br/>With that being said, it must too be stated that all the actors here do a wonderful job at, at least, trying to create versatile, believable characters, although few succeed. Sandra Bullock is the standout here, simply giving it her all and showing us true character-acting versatility in not only her role-choices, but her creative and involved performances. Ludicrous isn't as outgunned as I thought he'd be, Don Cheadle does exceptional work, Matt Dillon is great here, and so is the rest of the cast. But inevitably, I'm reminded of the one-dimensional characters they play and the truly vacuous background that plagues each and every one of them. A quick look at other reviewers scattered across the internet show that their shallowness has neglected people to notice the good acting behind them.<br/><br/>The film concludes with one of the lamest, most uncreative Hollywood endings in a blue moon, showing us easily the most schmaltzy, conventional, unbelievable, cringe-inducing ending a film about racism could possible give us. Even with dedicated performances from a barrage of different talents, Crash connects their characters' stories in such a contrived and facile way it's distracting, is plagued by levels of sheer incredulity, and occupies an end scene of complete and total folderol. As a whole, it plays like a heavy-handed lecture by a representative of the ""Why Can't We All Just Get Along?"" committee.<br/><br/>Starring: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Shaun Toub, and Michael Peña.

","Crash is probably the most offensive movie I have seen in my entire life. Based purely on ignorant stereotypes of ethnicities and Los Angeles, it really just dragged on without any constructive ideas. I wouldn't recommend anyone paying to see this movie.

It wasn't just racist to minorities either. The acting was alright, the premise was interesting in theory, but did not play well through the dialogue or plot, editing was fine, the cinematography was pretty good, however there are some shots that were solely for the purpose of ""looking good"" but did not add to the story."

Are we supposed to relate to their inner struggles and personal demons? I just didn't know -- <br/><br/>I mean, just when you started to relate to a character they switched to another story - I honestly can't say that I cared about a single one of them (with the exception of the locksmith and the little girl -- who was unfortunate enough to have possibly the cheesiest scene in the movie ( ""I saved you daddy..."" )) <br/><br/>Why did the director feel the need to 'idiot proof' the movie by showing the box marked blanks? <br/><br/>Why did the Persian girl and her father speak English to each other when they were alone? <br/><br/>Why was it snowing in Los Angeles (at least the frogs in Magnolia offered a genius ending which left the viewer discussing the meaning behind it long after they left the theater.. I mean, when the viewer is wondering how they are going to tie up the movie, frogs just fell from the sky -- genius.) <br/><br/>At least if the little girl would have been killed at the end of the movie there would have been some emotional involvement for the viewer (and then the racism / mayhem that surrounded all of the characters would have caused something truly tragic to happen to someone who was completely innocent. That would have at least made me think rather than just feel like I was being preached to...) <br/><br/>The acting was great - There were some very strong scenes ...

The story was kept tight enough to keep the viewers interested...<br/><br/>Overall however, they tried to be too deep and too political --- <br/><br/>It is unfortunate because it could have been a great movie --- <br/><br/>6/10 -- Not what I expected, but not terrible ... <br/><br/>Let me know what you think ...."

","This film's script, in short, sounded like a high-school senior's writing debut in which they desperately wanted to be provocative, to make their first piece about something that matters, something real. Well, if it HAD been a high-school senior's screenplay, I could have written off how horrendously over-the-top the screenplay is with its sledgehammer style of preaching one long two-hour sermon. Instead, the script came out of the mouths of people long in the industry. What an embarrassment! From opening scene to last credit, this is by far one of the worst films I have seen in a long time, and such a SHAME that it was even MENTIONED at the Academy Awards (which, after last night, was the last straw for me... the AA's are absolutely bogus and driven more by what will bring people to the box office... and perhaps what will get people to buy DVD's). As an aside, the mere fact that the president of the Academy made several attempts (both himself and through others) at encouraging movie fans to GO TO THE THEATRES (translation: ""The box office had a bad year, so stop using Netflix and go out, pay $10, and see the movie on a big screen in a theatre!)... AND the ""Brokeback Mountain"" snub just goes to show that not only is money (no surprise here!) important above all, but if ""Brokeback"" HAD won over ""Crash"", there would have been perchance another bad year at the box office as people incapable of embracing a film such as BM would have, maybe, boycotted Hollywood. God forbid they take a chance! So go with the sledgehammer of a sermon movie. Seriously, I could have accepted ANYTHING winning over this piece of motion picture filth. Pathetic film. Save your time.

"Cardinalnem","1","18","35","15 May 2005"," As Bad As It Gets
","I know of no clearer instance of the folly of a too ambitious director filming his own stories or screenplays than this latest offering from TV writer manque, Paul Haggis. While Haggis, or his cinematographer, may have some talent for the visual,(I have in mind certain of the overhead shots and those wide vistas of Los Angeles), if he has any talent for fresh and effective storytelling, in this film he's done his best to hide it. Except for a few pointed racial wisecracks (think ""All In The Family"") and some vituperative huffing and puffing from a largely wasted Sandra Bullock, Haggis' dialogue along with his imitation, repetitive Kieslowski plot and stale optimistic theme is embarrassingly pedestrian. The film, replete with unconvincing coincidences (the Ryan Phillipe good cop/bad cop sequence is especially annoying), takes as premise the easy idea that we are all basically the same, essentially decent folk when push comes to shove, so it's more the pity, even baffling, that we can't all just get along. Haggis' is paint by numbers screen writing. Now while it might play before an experientially challenged audience in a TV studio or a Hollywood boardroom eager to think well of itself, as a vision of actual human nature or chance as contemporary urban human beings really encounter such, ""Crash"" unforgivably strains credibility and boorishly tires the ear."
"tedg","Null","8","13","29 August 2007"," Off to the Side
","Its an exciting time to be alive because basic notions of narrative are being reinvented. Movies are where it is happening.<br/><br/>Now imagine that you are a writer and you want to do something honest, because honest is affecting and you want to resonate. Suppose you suspect yourself of simple, superficial effects, like that offensive ""Million Dollar Baby"" affair. Suppose you have some money and you really want to escape the feeling that you don't matter. You'll make your own ""important"" movie.<br/><br/>There's a challenge. Essentially no movie today can be honest and direct in the sense of being without modern reflection and what folks (inadequately) call irony. You just cannot escape it, no matter how emotionally pure and connected you wish to be. So the first challenge is to structure the thing so that these elements are shunted off to areas where people won't notice. This fellow knows enough about his craft to do so, and the results are interesting.<br/><br/>Contrast this with one of Altman's multithreaded projects. Or ""Magnolia."" The way they work is that they assume the world flows independently of what we see. The camera jumps from node to node, discovering enough about what is happening for us to make a story out of it. But that story is ours, synthesized in the eye. <br/><br/>This here is different. Everything we see are stories but they are complete stories. We see the beginning and end of each. We know that each isn't a part of a great river but is contained in discrete packages for us. The stories take the place of the world and come from the film to us. We have no say in making them.<br/><br/>Now this, I think is by design. All the modernity, the self-reflective and ironic character we need is shunted off into this cosmological corner, into place where most viewers never look. That allows the stories, and more importantly the actors, the freedom to just work at connecting. Not a complex connection where we get context about the channel, but direct, emotional contact. That's because this whole project is based not on making sense, giving us cleverness, or even mattering in our lives. Its all about connection, contact, soft crash. <br/><br/>Its an engineered risk, because it confounds itself in unexpected ways. The first is that it underscores that matters of race in the US are matters of inherited story. Those templates come to us in life much like the stories in the movie come: whole, encapsulated, apparently immutable. Inescapable. But at the same time, since the boundaries are so solid, the role of will and change and redemption are so remote, all we can do is take it as it comes. So it connects while it comes and is lost after it goes.<br/><br/>I think this writer, Haggis, might actually be able to do something that matters, that folks will count in the future as something forward and not backward. He sure understands the machinery. There's even a mechanical fold about mechanical folding. The most intense story is about a black man and his not-so-black wife. He's a maker of films (actually TeeVee, following Ted's law of layered abstraction). The things he makes are race stories, and his constraints mirror those that Haggis has. You can see Haggis diagramming this.<br/><br/>All in all, the connection didn't work with me. Its too contrived to be real. To judge from the way it is celebrated, most viewers will disagree because to them the mechanics aren't noticed as intended. I may have ruined this for you, which is why I put the spoiler tag on the beginning.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"mstomaso","7","8","13","14 April 2007"," Over-rated? Well, OK...But still good!
","Let me be blunt...Crash won best picture because the Academy did not want to give it to Brokeback Mountain. It's a good film, but not the best of 2004. And the Oscar for the script is also a bit of a stretch. The editing Oscar, however, is well-deserved.<br/><br/>The script and the multiplicity of plots are full of exaggeration. This bothered me at first, but as the interconnected plots began to reveal themselves, I was drawn in. The cinematography and the performances of the ensemble cast are exceptionally good, but the plot - frankly - seems more like a collection of 30 minute TV detective show plots all tied together by a few threads and themes than a post-modern masterpiece. <br/><br/>The theme is primarily racism, and it is exaggerated and overdone (in some of the plots and characters) almost to the extremes of Do The Right Thing. But Crash is no comedy, and in its tragedy, some truths about prejudice in general are revealed. The film also ties together many other themes which are less well examined. The cast of characters have a bewildering array of problems which they must sort through or yield to. <br/><br/>A few of the performances really stand out: Don Cheadle, Michael Pena, Matt Dillon and Karina Annoyave are particularly impressive after my first viewing. The film is really a long string of vignettes which appears to take place over a fairly short period of time (one of the many rather unbelievable aspects of the plot). Each character is followed briefly for the resolution or advancement of the subplots in which they are involved and then it is on to the next. Yet the film does not quite achieve the level of post-modern semi-coherence that, for example, Magnolia, Inland Empire or Slacker did. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes are unforgettable. Matt Dillon's epiphany as he rescues a woman from a flaming car wreck - both cinematographically and in terms of performance - is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I recommend this film. Although the whole film tends to be over-the-top, and the script creates characters that are neither wholly likable nor truly credible, it does a nice job of balancing its nightmare/fantasy elements with the reality of the human condition. It also brow-beats its audience a bit - and then follows up with redemptions, sacrifices, and commitments to humanity. Finally, if you enjoyed Babel, you are likely to enjoy Crash - structurally and dramatically very similar films set in very different places and with very different characters."
"chuante","Null","8","13","12 March 2006"," A waste of good acting.
","As a Mexican-American born and raised in the Los Angeles area, I thought this film was shallow and very small in scope. The message I got was ""everyone in L.A. is racist and corrupt."" The storyline was predictable and contrived -- not far from being a soap-opera. I mean, give me a break -- L.A. has a dense population, and yet these characters seem to keep running into each other in a matter of two-three days? I go weeks -- maybe months -- without bumping into people I know -- go figure! Furthermore, it was not truly representative of the cultural mosaic of Los Angeles; where were the Jewish and gay communities in all of this? They are two extremely large communities, and yet it was as if they didn't exist. Hmmm... what does that say about the person who wrote this screenplay? Interesting. Overall,it was a mediocre film. They could have simply removed the cursing and nude scene and aired it on the LIFETIME channel. Not Oscar worthy, in my opinion."

","Although Crash contains some amazing performances by folks such as Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon, the concept and aspects of the plot have been almost entirely lifted out of two other films: Robert Altman's spectacular 1993 film SHORT CUTS and Alejandro González Iñárritu's 2000 masterpiece, AMORRES PERROS (Love's a Bitch). Both of these films, which precede CRASH, feature characters whose lives intertwine around one singular horrific event. In SHORT CUTS, it's a California earthquake; in AMORRES PERROS, it's a car accident. Both Altman's film (based on Raymond Carver shorts stories) and Inarritu's film are original and innovative in the structure and way in which they ""tell"" the story: nonlinear, unorthodox, and sometimes seemingly random in terms of sequence. Paul Haggis took the best from these two films and made a derivative movie that, although containing some wonderful acting, does not broaden the horizon of film-making or storytelling."
"tnrcooper","4","6","9","8 March 2008"," Overrated, over-simplified look at life through just one lens
","I don't understand why so many people think this film is so insightful. It suggests that people are incapable of seeing past race when other features-socio-economic class, gender, everyday life, shared humanity-make life a lot more complex and richer than would be suggested if one was to take one's impression of what life in Los Angeles is like if one did not know anything about it and viewed only this film. <br/><br/>To suggest that once someone gets in a car crash, as happens at the beginning of the film, between Jennifer Esposito and, I believe Wendy Rhee, a Korean woman, and both women start spewing racial epithets almost immediately, or that Ludicrous, if self-aware enough to appreciate the difficult circumstances into which he is born, as a black man in America, as he does early in the film, but then blindly acts in ways which re-enforce such stereotypes, is ridiculous. To suggest that a racist cop would see the error of his ways so suddenly-or even that a racist cop would so brazenly exemplify this racism in such an ugly manner in his personal life in addition to his racist treatment of people on the job-is ridiculous. If someone has been that racist so unrepentantly for that long, it is difficult to imagine that he would change so quickly simply on account of one interaction with one person-is ridiculous. If the racist cop (played by Matt Dillon) was truly that racist, perhaps he would be racist, but not in the over-the-top, obscene manner in which he is. Even at the LAPD, and certainly in his personal relations, he would not have developed as he did, were he so unevolved. In addition to that, the notion that one cop would have two lengthy encounters with the same person on two consecutive days with such emotional weight, in a city the size of Los Angeles, is ridiculous. The chances of that must be in the billions or trillions. That director Paul Haggis would focus on a wealthy white woman (Sandra Bullock-very good)'s racist attitudes to the exclusion of any other elements of her character, or that we would focus on the racism of Don Cheadle or Jennifer Esposito or any of the other very good actors in this film, to almost complete exclusion of any other considerations-is ridiculous. Another scene which was ridiculous in the film was Ryan Philippe's intervention on behalf of Ludicrous' gangbanging character. The complete disregard for police rules of engagement is simply crazy. Perhaps if only one or two of these elements were the case, the film might be more believable, but Haggis' continuing and unstinting consideration of race as the only issue acting in our lives in Los Angeles is ridiculous. <br/><br/>I understand the desire of people to want to praise this film and the conclusions are interesting. However, it seems the screenplay and idea for the film is enormously simplistic and would require perhaps fewer characters and attention to the effect of factors other than simply race. Haggis' motives, I'm sure, were pure, but this to me, is offensive to the behavior of anyone who attempts to act in stressful situations in a decent, reasonable manner. Many people, millions and billions of times a day, make choices which would refute Haggis' contention that when faced with stressors, humans revert to unevolved prejudices against which, apparently, any reason is helpless. This movie is greatly over-simplified and offensive."

When viewing such movies there is a simple rule that one must apply: 1) In spite of they hype, the movie will NOT be great.<br/><br/>If you doubt this rent ""Blair Witch Project"".<br/><br/>Thus, I started the DVD with low expectations. I expected the usual ""whitey is bad"". To be honest, there was less of that sentiment than I anticipated. It was actually refreshing to see other races portrayed in such a fashion. Upon reflection, it was good to see that all the characters were given the same two-dimensional treatment.<br/><br/>From what I've read here, I understand that we were supposed to be sympathetic to the character that Ludicrous was playing. Just wow! I've not heard such preaching since Laurence Fishburn's diatribes in ""Boys in the Hood"".<br/><br/>Then there is the whole ""guns are bad"" and the ""LAPD is racist LOL"" aspect. Disappointing, but hardly surprising given Hollywood's world-view.<br/><br/>Films, by their very nature ARE manipulative and yes, I guess the whole ""Little Girl"" sub-plot might have been over-the-top, but as the parent of a three-year-old, I found myself engaged with it and was glad to see it ended well. For my tastes, there is just too much garbage and evil that is shown in movies, just for the sake of being shocking. Thus my pleasure at that one syrupy story line.<br/><br/>I guess what surprised me the most was that I expected more to go ""wrong"". The problem was that after a while, the ""twists"" didn't twist and the death of the cop's brother at the end (come on, who didn't see THAT coming) was meaningless.

She is trapped in an overturned car on fire, and he ""heroically"" saves her. She not only forgives him, but looks like she's fallen in love with him, ready to let the ""heroic"" white racist ravage her black body.<br/><br/>So by him performing his job as a cop, he is suddenly shown to not be a ""real"" racist, but a good person at heart.

It is a gimmick for the filmmakers to try to have the audience believe that they themselves have racist or preconceived notions about the characters based on their race, when in fact, the audience has been purposely mislead in order to set up the ""surprise"" endings.<br/><br/>It's the same if say a film spends 90 minutes showing a character who kills everyone he meets, but in the final 5 minutes, this character inexplicably changes his whole behavior and refuses to fight, and ends up getting himself killed from his newfound pacifism.<br/><br/>Is the audience truly challenged or ""exposed"" for their ""preconceptions""? In the case of ""Crash"", absolutely not.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a dishonest, manipulative film that gets cheap laughs off racist jokes and stereotypes, while at the same time, makes ""heros"" out of its racist characters through contrived ""redemption"".<br/><br/>The ending with the black-pride carjacker who ""saves"" the truckload of Asian slaves by releasing them in Chinatown while spewing racial epithets at them wraps up this horrific turkey quite nicely in the absolute most pretentious manner possible.<br/><br/>""Crash"" may indeed not just be the worst film of 2005, but the worst film so far of the century."

I just don't get the point of distributing a film that promotes the origins of stereotypes. Don't we all know where the stereotypes came from? Don't we also know that there are people who continue to believe in those stereotypes? Don't we also know that there are those who fit the stereotypes? As a society, have we not progressed past many of the stereotypes and attitudes portrayed in this film? In large, the stereotypes and attitudes as portrayed in this film are outdated. Being an African American male, living in the south and working in an industry that very few blacks choose as a career, I encounter racism daily. However, it is more sophisticated and not nearly as blatant as what was shown in this film. If attitudes like that still exist in L.A., then that city is far behind the rest of the country in terms of race relations and racial attitudes and behaviors.

Period. It doesn't matter if it won various screenplay awards or not. It's terrible. Screenplay's teachers often say that the dialogs are irrelevant - well, in a commercial point of view, yes; but awards-wise, the story is(or should be) completely other. Crash obviously wasn't nowhere near of having the best screenplay of it's year.<br/><br/>And still, Crash has some of the dullest, forced dialogs that I've ever heard, and often they involved racism. Yes. It was so unrealistic that I couldn't help but laugh. It was hilarious. It was so bad that it makes James Cameron screenplays looks like Shakespeare plays in comparison. Is just ridiculous.<br/><br/>The character development is another thing I strongly disliked. For a film that wants to be so 'emptionally involving', the characters are just pathetic. I couldn't care any less for what was happening, and again, I just observed with a smirk on the face all the hilarious attempts of the film to make emotional contriving situations, because really, It was awful, forced and completely unrealistic. But yes, the music and the flashy editing are two things to be appreciated in the film. Matt Dillon acting is good, actually, and the film's pace isn't bad, the film always goes ahead, so it wasn't a boring experience. The editing, in fact, was the only aspect that truly deserved awards. The rest, forgettable and average at best.<br/><br/>I think this film is not worth of your time at all, certainly one of the worst Oscar winners of all time. 5.9/10"
"Buddy-51","3","11","20","25 April 2006"," Is the Academy kidding with this?
","Like a bad student film with big-name stars in its cast, Paul Haggis' puerile and self-important ""Crash"" is a masterpiece for the easily impressed. Filled with bathos and bombast, and more implausible coincidences than an 800-page novel by Charles Dickens (and no offense meant to Mr. Dickens), ""Crash"" plays less like a movie and more like some underachiever's dissertation for a Sociology course entitled Racism 101. (Racist white cop fondles black woman in front of her husband at routine traffic stoppause projectordiscuss what this scene shows about racism in our societyresume filmsame racist white cop pulls same black woman to safety from burning wreckagepause projectordiscuss what this scene says about the possibility of redemption for every individualetc.). Astonishingly, this piece of mealy mouthed claptrap won the Academy Award for the Best Picture of 2005.<br/><br/>Cribbing its interlocking, multi-character format from ""Short Cuts,"" ""Grand Canyon,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""13 Conversations About One Thing"" and a whole host of other similar but far superior films, Haggis' work purports to tell us that everyone - and I mean EVERYONE - living in Los Angeles is a thoroughgoing racist and bigot and, even more amazingly, spends twenty-four hours a day giving voice to their prejudice. Forget about political correctness; these people talk about race, race and nothing but race for nigh unto two hours in ways that show that Haggis is completely tone deaf when it comes to how people in the real world actually speak. This is a movie devoid of a single plausible moment (you know that verisimilitude is not high on this film's agenda when it starts snowing in Los Angeles!); it's a movie in which characters act completely without reason or motivation and in which every event that happens, no matter how idiotic or ridiculous, does so in the service of the message. On the level of dramaturgy alone, ""Crash"" is an unmitigated disaster and a blueprint for how not to make a movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as ""Crash"" itself begins to crash and burn, an awful lot of fine people wind up getting trapped inside the wreckage. A largely talented cast is wasted on an assortment of poorly written, shallow characters, and Haggis has no idea of how to create either drama or tension in any of the scenes he shows us. The moody score by Mark Isham does its best to make it all seem powerful and important, but the sheer incompetence of the writing and directing rob the film of both those qualities. Indeed, rarely has a movie been as full of itself as ""Crash"" is, and rarely has a movie explored such a serious and important subject in as pretentious and superficial a manner. Perhaps the most insulting aspect of the film is how easily it bestows redemption on even its most wretched characters, as if all of life's problems could be so easily wrapped up in time for the closing credits. As others before me have pointed out, this is indeed a ""feel good"" movie about racism, the very last thing a movie about racism should ever be.<br/><br/>If you can buy a film in which an assortment of whiney, unappealing characters hurl racial invectives at one another for an hour and a half, then turn around and throw themselves into each others' arms in time for the tear-stained finale, then ""Crash"" may be the movie for you. But if you find yourself laughing rather than weeping through the course of the story, don't say you hadn't been warned beforehand.<br/><br/>What could all the fine folk in the Motion Picture Academy have been thinking?"

","I literally love every one of the actors featured in this film and desperately wanted to love this movie however:<br/><br/>From start to finish this film was heavy handed, forced, leading, pretentious, self important, overly sentimental and at times downright corny.<br/><br/>There was too much dialog (show me don't tell me please), and the lines were way to preachy. Each scene was full of forced speeches (instead of natural interchanges and situations) where all the actors screamed and shouted and practically beat you over the head trying to make the directors point (I could almost hear the keys of the his trusty typewriter as I watched this film). It was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Scenes ran on way too long.<br/><br/>I did not care about or connect with any of the characters as none of them were developed. These fine actors were instead used as puppets. Pawns moved around a board at the directors whim to fit into a fake story which relies way too heavily on coincidence to even pass as one.<br/><br/>There were loose ends, and when there was an attempt to bring one of the situations to a conclusion the scenario was so off-the-wall and out of the clear blue it bordered on absurdity. <br/><br/>This director just needed too many things to happen in order to piece this poor excuse for a story together, (and by-god he was going to make those things happen if it killed him), so instead of a nice natural feel and flow (which it paramount to ANY great film) it just felt desperate, overwrought, forced and fake. I mean this guy really whittled those square pegs and there were lots of them.<br/><br/>I submit that if that if a story has to rely that heavily on coincidence, big speeches and over the top situations it's not a story at all but a soapbox for the director to tap dance on top of and that's not what I pay good money to see in a theater. <br/><br/>This is what happens when a director gets caught up trying to make a big-time social statement instead of using the silver screen for the purpose intended: To tell a magnificent story (no matter what the genre) with wonderfully multi-dimensional characters that the audience, good or bad, will connect with. To weave the moral, if you will, invisibly, flawlessly into the story and leave the weight of said moral for each audience member to determine for themselves. <br/><br/>This film is a ruse and a cheat and I'm amazed that so many liked it.<br/><br/>I'll stop now. This comment has taken enough time from my life I can never get back and I already lost two hours on the film itself."

","What a disappointment this film was for me! I attended the Toronto premiere with the cast and filmmaker and found this film to be filled with the worst kinds of racial stereotypes (pick one,it was there.)The filmmaker is Canadian and the presenter introduced this film by saying that it took a Canadian to see and portray The States as honestly as he did. Now I'm no flag-waver, but we're not all as bad as this film would lead you to believe!<br/><br/>With such a noteworthy cast(Don Cheadle,Brendan Fraser,Sandra Bullock,etc.,) I would have expected more,but there was very little for these actors to work with. Very little character development,trite dialogue. Don Cheadle,of course,is wonderful in everything he does,but this type of story has been done much more effectively-think Magnolia,Short Cuts,without the substance."

","I was prepared to like this movie. Critics hailed the film as a modern morality play, a commentary on the rank bigotry with which many of us confront the increasing ethnic diversity of our culture. I expected to be challenged, even provoked. Instead, I found myself wondering which movie the critics reviewed. ""Crash"" is a sophomoric, unrelentingly bleak pageant of disjointed and improbable character sketches. The writing is melodramatic and often illogical, and the characters are surprisingly one-dimensional and unsympathetic, with one notable exception. The film-makers certainly succeeded in demonstrating that no one is above racial and ethnic prejudice. In fact, the audience is bludgeoned repeatedly with this truism. African-Americans, whites, Iranians, and Asians appear to have reached a rather perverse equality: they hate each other equally and are equally capable of brutish behavior. Only a Hispanic character, played with warmth and tenderness by Michael Pena, manages to escape with a semblance of humanity. Most annoying, the entire movie rests on the unlikely premise that in a metropolis the size of Los Angeles characters who were previously unacquainted would encounter each other repeatedly, allowing the writers to tie all of the subplots together in one neat bow. What should have been a sterling cast is simply wasted. Even the great Don Cheadle is reduced to operatic posturing and is forced to deliver lines that are truly ridiculous. What man of any color would tell his mother in such stark terms that he was ""indisposed"" when she called? How could he have been so clueless as to the ethnicity of his paramour? Cheadle wasn't the only victim of the writers' incompetence. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, and Terrence Howard make valiant efforts to breathe life into a lifeless script, but they are doomed to failure. Ludicrous and Larenz Tate manage a mildly comic turn while engaging in the only interesting dialogue in the film. I have no idea why Brendan Fraser or Tony Danza were in the movie at all. Not since Sean Penn's disastrous ""The Crossing Guard"" have writers and a director done so little with so much!"

","Wow, what else can be said. This movie is sheer power not only in language but visuals. Picture life and the world we live in, most people live their lives through their own lives. Thinking their story is the movie being played out. But in fact this movies breaks down that barrier and shoots the the story from so many angles and fills in the wholes with imagery. In a perfect world I am sure we would not look at each other with different views and opinions, but we do not live in a perfect world.<br/><br/>The cuts of racism run deep in our culture and our lives that we automatically assume. The movie was a movie where people are shown the lives of so many people and their views and practically overnight it is radically changed.<br/><br/>""You think you know who you are. You have no idea."" This is the perfect tagline in the movie, and the perfect phrase coming from Matt Dillon.<br/><br/>When we are first introduced to these people we can only see first impressions. But, who they think they are is not truly who they are. This movie speaks wonderful messages and it was shot beautifully.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis did a wonderful job. The cast was also wonderful, and believable in being real people. I say this because people like Don Cheadle take the role and give it to the audience in a way that they would understand it. They would accept and see the social implications it brings within their own life.<br/><br/>The transitions in the movie from beginning to the end gave the movie itself a real credible front. The art of storytelling went beyond telling a story but delved deep into the audiences soul prodding forth some sort of emotional understand of the deep message.<br/><br/>Evil is not always evil, and good and not always good. sometimes it is hard to tell which is which. Or even prove that either really exist.<br/><br/>I hope everyone takes the time to watch this movie but take it for what it truly is. Not entertainment, but a factual and honest take of modern day attitudes and ignorance about racism and stereotypes."
"greg_wilson","5","16","33","9 May 2005"," Much Ado About Nothing
","Much ado about nothing... This is all that's running through my head as I am walking out of the screening of Paul Haggis' directorial debut, Crash. As I am watching this movie, it suddenly occurred to me -- I have seen it before. I saw it when I saw Magnolia, and Traffic, and Grand Canyon, etc. I suddenly realized that formulaic, cookie-cutter plot lines and freeze-dried characters weren't the exclusive domain of the buddy action picture or Adam Sandler movie. It seems that the lack of creativity and voice can, and is, being applied to the message genre as well. In this case the message is racism, but it doesn't matter because the sermon is the same.<br/><br/>The thing is, all of the actors in the ensemble do an amazing job, and each takes these very substantial meaty roles and chews them up. But in the end, there is nothing new to say. Each character has good and bad in them. Each one is racist and each one isn't. They, like we, are colored in shades of gray.<br/><br/>But deep inside the film, there is a better movie trying to get out. There are moments of true questions of abuse of authority that I would have loved to have seen more about. There are moments of tremendous tenderness on every level between a father and son, a wife and husband, between friends, between lovers... There are moments where I wanted to know more about how these very real, well-developed characters got to where they are and how they are managing when they find themselves exposed and vulnerable. These moments -- these relationships may or may not have anything to do with racism, but it has everything to do with being human. These are the moments that I got caught up in and these are the moments that were given no more than a peek of life before the movie moved onto some other contrived opportunity to once again demonstrate a scene of racism.<br/><br/>In the end, the characters of Crash, like society, are filled with shades of gray. Crash seems to have a lot of volume, but not really a lot to say."

","The Academy Awards the movie garnered were probably just Hollywood liberal guilt. Best Picture, Best Supporting actor and Best film! ?? The gods must be crazy! I think what bothered me most about the film was not just the simplistic resolutions of each subplot and the manipulation, but that each character, with the possible exception of the profoundly banal ""princess"" played by Sandra Bullock, could have been the vehicle for a truly authentic examination of character and conflict. <br/><br/>Matt Dillon (Best Supporting) especially offered a lot of completely untapped possibilities. How can a man who molested and humiliated the black couple turn around and risk his life to save the same woman from the inferno of her car. This is real and happens every day. <br/><br/>I don't know if you remember the scandal of the fire truck full of pilfered Gap jeans that was found near ground zero after September 11 that caused such a furor. The best explanation of the decade (and perhaps all time) was offered by a NYFD commander, ""the wind must have blown them into the truck."" How could these heroic firemen, some of whom gave their lives to save their fellow citizens, also be pretty thieves? Amerikan society demands we must always look at people as wholly good or wholly evil, ultimately redeemable, but never as they are  an often non-resolvable mixture of both. <br/><br/>In the case of the Dillon policemen, the situation is even more complex  something the movie seemed willing to present but was unable or afraid of examining authentically. I have had a fair amount of contact with police (Chicago), in both positive and negative situations, and found that many I have met seem to exhibit a kind of compartmentalized dual personality. To people whom they regard as ""the good guys,"" occupants of certain accepted racial or socioeconomic classes or citizens in distress, they can be everything the society expects them to be and even heroically more. Should you fall outside these arbitrary but nevertheless well-defined limits, you can expect little fair or even humane treatment. I have seen officers switch back and forth between these two categories - sometimes even in the same sentence. I think this discernment occurs in the reptilian brain and is not even a part of their conscious higher-brain functioning. That is why you would be surprised to watch how this ""rebel"" behaves in the presence of a ""constable on patrol."" I never show any signs of hostility or belligerence. Only a fool stands on principle with a man, any man, with a gun. I am especially surprised when poor, supposedly street-savvy black people try to give an officer a hard time. Even when completely justified, it is the dumbest thing that a person of color can do in most parts of this country. It must represent a kind of deeply ingrained death-wish. Even though the scene was obscenely over drawn, I was unsympathetic to the molested Thandie Newton. <br/><br/>I thought, for a brief moment, when Matt Dillon removed her from the burning car that we were in for a deeper examination of his character and perhaps an understanding of this schizophrenia that I mentioned. But no, as the final shot of the sequence seemed to imply, we were to be subjected to just another movie-of the-week resolution that denied the essential elements of the real conflict. <br/><br/>I think the most disturbing thing about Crash was the manipulation. Its failure was not accidental/unintentional  it was made well (Big deal. When was the last time you saw even a badly made Adam Sandler film?), but dishonest in a profound way. Propaganda? For whom? The producers deliberately set out to reinforce stereotypes (even in the guise of denying them) as well as creating merely a feel-good resolution to problems that require a far deeper analysis. With solutions like these we don't need any more problems.<br/><br/>Bob Boldt"
"Mr_Baxter","1","11","21","26 April 2006"," a poorly-written, racist, unintelligent, pretentious lecture on racism
","Crash (2004), its a monument to mediocrity. The film, which preaches racial tolerance, is, in of itself, racist. Filled with every single stereotype and cliché known to mankind, this film stumbles through its 1:45 minute run with poorly written dialog and half conceived subplots. This film is nothing new, nor original, in any way shape or form. For every good piece of dialog (Michael Pena's heartwarming scene with his daughter, all though it may have just been the actor) there are about 10x more scenes of awful dialog (the rest of the movie). For every good actor (Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Michael Pena) there are about 10x more bad actors (Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillipe, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Matt Dillon...). The perfect example of this is the scene with Michael Pena, his daughter and the Middle Eastern store owner. You see the little girl running, and you know she's going to die, and your heart is wrenched and you feel awful even though the scene is filmed in the corniest way possible. And then, in the most pathetic way, the girl lives, and the scene loses all of its power and becomes foolish. The movie is almost unbearable to watch, with such favorite lines as ""You think you know who you are, but you don't."" and ""I'm angry all the time, and I don't know why!"" being spouted off at every turn. The worst part of this god-awful movie is Haggis' need to spell out every single situation and emotion for the viewer, instead of letting them do some of the work themselves. That condescension and obviousness turns the film into a racist, unintelligent, pretentious lecture on racism.<br/><br/>Rating: 1/10"

","The movie of the season, rather of the whole year, did not impress me all the while I tried hard to read into its kindergarten narrative to find out what did the jury see into it that I, both as a ""class"" and a ""mass"", could not see. I liked the simplicity of the stories when it began and was awaiting that wondrous Oscar-winning twist and bang and collision and crash that would astound me to reaffirm my belief in the sanctity of the holiest of holies, but sadly it got over before that could happen. Disappointment! big time disappointment. As some other reviewers have aptly pointed out, you simply can't disrespect our intelligence by giving us THIS in the name of good cinema, from an industry that has matured over an era of cinematic gems. Though its not that the academy is doing a great job with the nominations either- I simply find it unfathomable to see films like Munich, Broken Flowers,Syriana, Good Night and Good Luck, Jarhead, The Matador, or even King Kong relegated to some bad-cinema alleys and people like Matt Dillon being nominated. But this is heights of cinematic injustice- to give the Best Picture Award to something like Crash which is pretense and presupposition at its worst. I would like to appeal to people to publicly support this disgust that I and many other movie lovers on and outside IMDb share. We, who hope and wait and cherish and appreciate good cinema, would never digest this bad joke. I am from India where ""Being Bollywood"" is a tag many contemporary film makers are running away from. I am sorry to say but Crash was nothing but Bollywood- remixed. At least you can't expect Indians to buy the supposedly-innovative plot that amused the world(or so what we are made to believe). I do not need to say why I am so disappointed, because many other one-star reviews would tell you a clear picture, but the points where I simply lost it were- a childish stereotypical depiction of racism(you should see Higher Learning, Dangerous Minds, American HistoryX etc to see how ""real"" these depictions can be), the tattooed-""gangbanger""-daughter angle, the predictable ""surprise"" in the end, the ubiquity of cross races all around(correct me if I am wrong, a US friend of mine told me LA is like that but they have simply gone overboard in the name of artistic liberties), minimum or no use of camera-enhancements, the trying-so-hard-to-be-real dialogs, uninspired works of some actors like ...everyone actually.....I could go on... On a lighter note, the only good thing I liked is the scene at the gun-shop(the double-meaning dialog of the shopkeeper!) The film tries hard to be a Geography lesson, as one of the characters point out, but ironically, has created History by presenting yet another glaring example of bastardization of art-meets-life philosophy.<br/><br/>And you thought Indians did injustice by awarding Black the best film!"

Every line just dripped meaning and impact, every bit of film was a money shot of sociopolitical commentary. Oh, and every character was a stark raving bore.<br/><br/>And it's not that I want to come off as some sort of Pat O'Reilly worshipper, because I'm the furthest thing from that - but come on, can we get any more hamfisted and heavy with the social commentary than saying racism and intolerance is bad? If Hagis had thrown in a biting and pointed protest against land mines and rape, he'd have batted a perfect 1000 in the ball game of preaching to the choir.<br/><br/>This movie was incredibly tedious - the cinematic version of confession. And it's not even like the sins committed were all that grotesque. ""Forgive me father, for I have sinned. Today I woke up and I was still rich and white and I just wish I could do something for all of those poor, poor minorities who wish they were like me!"" ""Make a movie my son and bore the living hell out of every viewer out there and all will be forgiven."" Paul Haggis - if you ever read this: Get over yourself.

(And in case you don't get it the first time, this is pointed out again and again in the movie.) The dialogue is exasperating because it comes across as unnatural and lacks any subtlety whatsoever. For example, characters will often launch into preachy, long-winded speeches about their views of race in America during a casual encounter with another character. Characters also have the annoying habit of providing too much information about their personal backgrounds to each other; such self-disclosures ring false because they are tangential to the conversation at hand and seem included mainly to force the viewer into an understanding of the roots of that particular character' s racism. Whatever happened to the notion of show don't tell or allowing viewers to piece together things on their own? The movie is also melodramatic in a bad way, relying heavily on coincidence in order to connect the main characters in the different plot lines. In the end, the movie comes across like the effort of an overly-zealous adolescent who is eager to tackle big issues but lacks the subtlety or maturity to execute it."

","CRASH <br/><br/>Okay, I'm not trying to sound controversial and annoying... but this movie is b.a.d. I certainly won't call it the worst movie of the year, because a truly terrible film does not have redeeming qualities. CRASH has a few moments and aspects that manage to shine despite the overall terribleness of the package.<br/><br/>The Good News...<br/><br/>The Thandie Newton/Matt Dillon car crash scene (the 2nd) was very powerfully constructed and beautifully played by the two actors. This five minute period was the only moment of the film that I felt came together and worked.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard, Ryan Phillipe & Thandie Newton offer good performances (I personally wouldn't nominate them for any awards, but it doesn't irk me to see that some of them are getting recognition).<br/><br/>The Bad News...<br/><br/>Everything else is wrong. I went into this film knowing the debate between people on these boards... some people don't find it preachy... others do. So I though I'd go into it with an open mind.<br/><br/>2 minutes in, from the second they showed Jennifer Esposito (a f*****n' detective) making fun of the way the other woman pronounces brakes ""blakes"" I knew this film was preachy. And then it just got worse and worse and worse. Sandra Bullock yelling and insisting on changing the clocks. Ludicrous' endless rants, shut up. For the entire first half of this movie, every single person is angry and screaming at each other.<br/><br/>Now I know racism exists, and I don't think that not liking CRASH means I don't understand that. I've heard arguments from some critics literally casting off negative reviews of this film saying ""you have no idea what racism is""... well you might be right, but that doesn't make this a good movie.<br/><br/>A movie is far more interesting if it takes a stereotype, and then examines it to make it something very independent... goes beyond the stereotype. This movie never bothers to do that... it tries to convey it's message by slamming stereotype after stereotype in your face. It doesn't take more than 10 minutes for it all to seem relentless.<br/><br/>If this movie were divided up into 8 different movies... and told each story with personal details and development... then I think you would have 8 films telling very unique, and honest stories about racism today. But they are all crammed in to the point where we never see the after-effects these terrible situations have on the victims. Instead, we merely see the incidents happening one after the other... Oh, but I'm sorry... they make it personal through that generic (just like on every F/X drama on the air today) slow-mo montage of the entire cast finding a happier place to some cool acoustic guitar music.<br/><br/>I can't believe this is has been so highly regarded in the Screenplay department. I think if you took that same screenplay, word for word, and didn't frame it with all the ""important movie"" clichés (i.e. slow mos, lots of swearing, money scenes, spiritual music... blah blah blah) this screenplay would obviously be seen as the melodramatic hack that it is.<br/><br/>Bullock, Cheadle, Fraser, Esposito, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, and every other actor in this movie couldn't manage to muster good performances from such dreg. It must have been hard being expected to deliver such campy lines w/o campy portrayals.<br/><br/>Everything is balanced terribly in this movie. My feelings towards this film are hard to capture adequately in a review... so after some reflection I might reword this. But in the end, CRASH deserves no awards this season... at least not in my book.<br/><br/>... F ..."

There's more.<br/><br/>Anyone saying this movie is ""good"" has decided that any art that proposes to depict subtle racism as common in some people's lives. That's fine for them. Not Me. I strongly believe that movies with racism like this should NOT promoted as artistic. They are the same as a slasher film, just put into a different wrapper. Hate mongering, fear-mongering trash.<br/><br/>I feel dirty and angry having watched it. When the film's creators and actors decided to thrust these (depicted) profoundly evil injustices on my psyche, I myself changed for the worse. I cannot go out and regard a person of color in a more fair lite after seeing movies where evil injustices are depicted - THEY PLAY ON MY PREJUDICES, and if I didn't have any before the movie THEY GIVE ME SOME then CRITICIZE ME FOR HAVING THEM. This is profoundly bad movie-making. It pushes prejudice on everyone, puts us in corners, and makes us feel guilty for being the same color as the actors who are portraying the evil it invents.<br/><br/>THIS MOVIE MAKES PEOPLE FEEL MORE HATE NOT LESS. This movie sucks in such a big way that I hope anyone who wants to see it will think twice about what the shape of their soul will be when they turn it off. I hope for a better world. I reject racism where I see it, and I know that every time someone even sees racism, they are converted to its cause, one way or another. This is because racism is built on HATE. Hate is built on FEAR. FEAR MONGERING HATE-FILLED FILMS LIKE THIS deserve no attention from kind people. Continue being a kind person. Reject racism and hate. Reject this freaking movie."

","The acting was very good in this movie. Certainly the number of stars was impressive.<br/><br/>I can't say much about cinematography because it was simply shot on the streets of a city so no luscious grand sunsets etc. I guess what was there didn't distract from the story. The style did fit the story, it's just that the cinematography didn't stand out as it often does in other movies.<br/><br/>I certainly believe all of this goes on in our world. It seems there are prejudices of many kinds. We all can treat each other so poorly. This movie deals with prejudice head on. There was a hint of individual recovery in the movie, but not enough to convince the audience that anyone was making life changes. I just don't understand why it was put together.<br/><br/>I don't really care to have each and every bad personality trait or behavior assembled into a two hour showing. As I said there was a hint that recovery and change might be coming, but at the same time that idea wasn't followed through. There was plenty of misguided things going on even at the end to make someone subject to prejudice to become angry. Which I'm sure wasn't the aim of the story."

","After the latest awards, I was really excited to go rent ""Crash"", which I had missed in the theater, and having recently become interested in the various films that explore the modern demographic fractal of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The story tries to follow 8 main characters that interweave through a day in Los Angeles, and there is some excellent acting, with actors playing against type. Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon all put in fine performances that deserved more publicity, and Ludicrous makes an impressive acting debut. The lighting is great and a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>It's just to bad the story and dialogue are so horrid. Every incident is pulled from a ""racial dynamics 101"" after-school special, with none of the subtlety and tension that underlies the real interplay between race, ethnicity and class in modern America. It comes across as a film about diversity and conflict as written by a white liberal who has never experienced any of these incidents, nor really knows someone who has.<br/><br/>By the middle of the movie, it's lost any sense of surprise, it's an interplay of stereotypes rather than characters, and it leaves no sense of tension. The one surprise for me involved the incident between the Hispanic family and the Persian store owner, and since that was my one surprise, I spoil it for you.<br/><br/>By it's end it was rather tedious, and I can't believe that this film won Best Picture unless the other candidates just stank. It's a real shame that this ones and ""A History of Violence"" (good - not great), wasn't even nominated.<br/><br/>Watch it for curiosity, but don't expect a good movie.

","""Crash"" was one big citadel for disseminated catastrophe! The film, ""Crash"" habitually purported the unnecessarily ruthless aspects to the questions of: ""What about this?"" ""What about that?"" Fatal consequences are incurred just because people find everything around them to be just a little too irksome to stomach! The premise being; ""Make it easier on me, let me hate my neighbor!!"" The penchant for belligerence is very widespread in this movie. The characters in ""Crash"" possess a callousness which is assertively second nature to them. Their attitudes manifest themselves by perpetually saying: ""I'm always angry, why? No real reason!"" The film's racial unrest was so ubiquitous that some seemingly normal individuals would ask this question with a very cavalier disposition: ""Is he black, or is he white? Yeah! It definitely matters!!"" The scenario is situated accordingly whereby all parties concerned perceive money to be everything, and a lack of money to be the only thing!! Such a collage of pejorative proclivities has manufactured a myriad of emotional hang ups with this film. So why did this flick win for best picture? My guess; Because of the film's originality. ""Crash"" was a movie which was comprised of these ingredients: A dash of violence, a pinch of sexually depraved behavior, a bevy of great actors and actresses, (Including Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon) and finally, it was topped off with wonderful directing. Galvanize all of these attributes, and it is not surprising that ""Crash"" was selected to be recipient of the proverbial and extremely coveted Academy Award Oscar for best film, above all other flicks that were competing for this honor in '2005! I personally liked ""Good Night and Good Luck"" better! This film was a runner up academy award nominee which was produced during the same year as ""Crash"" was! While ""Good Night and Good Luck"" was an intensely intellectual film, ""Crash"" however, was a much more elaborate production. The movie, ""Crash"", became the precarious purveyor of non justifiably violent responses which served as a subterfuge for camouflaging grotesque human indulgences. Mannerisms of this nature correlated to the wry vindication of everybody's personal misunderstandings! ""Crash"" can best be categorized as a sagacity for sinners. This film was a creative doggerel that became a reflection of the dark and psychologically unnerving criminal antics which concurrently prevailed! This plethora of felonious atrocities victimized everyone in the film in one way or another! These nefarious escapades eventually snowballed into an onslaught of cumbersome afflictions that wound up burdening the value system by which many typical Americans live! The film ""Crash"" is a demented depiction of how the truth is offensive because the truth is also stubborn, hence, it is simply the truth! Basically being a cunningly creative homogenization for hatred, it stands to reason that ""Crash"" should have won the academy award!! Indeed, ""Crash"" deservedly won for best picture! Okay!! So, what's the bottom line here? We have acquired a painstaking realization of just how deplorable our fixations on discriminating judgment really are!! Are we going to do anything about it? NO!!"
"powerfull_jedi","3","9","17","13 June 2006"," Racial drama tale shoots itself in the foot
","From Million Dollar Baby-scriptwritter Paul Haggis comes a heart-touching story about racial tensions in Los Angeles as he takes you to various small stories between characters and how race is an issue, however I don't know if this Los Angeles exists and can't seem to buy some of the most absurd situations and dialog between said «characters». I'll you this when a supposed hard-hitting drama is making you laugh you know there's something wrong. In this movie, we follow the lives of a rich black couple, two cops(one who is an all-out racist and one who seems to be normal on the surface), an Iranian shop-owner, a Spanish locksmith and the DA and his wife,two carjackers(they must be the dumbest carjackers I've ever seen and their code of honor is a strange one). and an Asian couple(though I don't know what are they doing in the movie) in 24 hours they all crash into each other, one way or another. Unless Los Angeles is some really small town, there's no way these same characters meet over and over again, but they do so as the scripts demands. And talk about dialog, must everything the characters say and do relate to race? You end up feeling more irritated then moved, and intrigued if people actually talk like this. The whole movie feels like a lecture on race and with a moral so cheap, you often question the depth of the characters. Sandra Bullock's and Brendan Fraser's performances are bad and some of the stuff the carjackers spit out sound like it's Chappelle's show(expect that Chappelle's show parodies racial situations). The first part of the story is essentially the encounters between the said characters(some of them are quite far-fetched), most of them of course showing racial tensions between minorities and non-minorities. In the second half of the film, everything fixes itself and everybody's happy in the end, sorta of contradicting the setup of the first half of the movie. It tries to be controversial, but it doesn't offer anything we haven't already seen in various others movies, TV series and crime novels. Once again, about the depth of the characters, some of them are just plain strange, I somehow find it hard to believe an African-American chief of police would turn a blind eye regarding the actions of certain cop of his precinct because ""it would be a lot of hassle"". Hard also to believe that they broke in a shop without taking the gun. Even if the gun had blanks they would still hurt(even though it would be minimal) if shot at that range. The laugh out loud high point of the movie was: when the movie director who's wife was molested by the cop earlier, he didn't do anything then because he was afraid to get shot by the police(yes, the people who enforce the laws and protect citizens, those police officers), decides to stand up for himself and punch out those two carjackers he never met who attempt to rob his SUV at !gunpoint!(yes, carjackers, criminals who rob cars) and when the police arrive, he doesn't turn the carjackers in, oh and he shouts at police too. It'll make you laugh, but it will ultimately leave you preoccupied with the message it conveys. Said carjackers then split up after that failed robbery, they never look for one another again. These are some of the absurd plot-points you will witness in the film. Better save your money on the DVD and rent American History X."

","Contrived, pretentious, and over-rated. Everything magically falls into place in this movie to tell the story, which is ... RACISM is ...BAD ! There are several over-the-top coincidences here. Are there only eight people in all of LA, and do they all happen to meet each other in 24 hours ? I'm sorry, but life doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>There are also various incongruous elements, such as the chop-shop fence not wanting to accept an SUV with a little blood underneath, but fully willing to engage in people-trafficking and slavery, with everything that entails. The scene with the cop stand-off is the most ridiculous. We all know that the black driver, anywhere in the good ole USA would have had about twenty-five bullet holes in him when he disregarded the cops' orders. <br/><br/>Some of the acting is decent, notably Cheadle, Bullock, Ludicrous, Dillon, and the young white ""good"" cop but some of the accents are LOUSY. What's up with the negative stereotyping of Asians ? Why are all the characters so simple and unidimensional ? And the ending, just like the beginning. How neat. Oh, the miracle of snow in LA, it's Christmas folks !. What a perfect piece of Hollywood dribble.<br/><br/>On a positive note, I see that many fellow IMDb reviewers found this movie as bad as I did, and their comments were more insightful than the pro reviewers'. <br/><br/>As alternatives, I recommend ""21 Grams"" or Lee's ""Do the right thing"". If you want a head trip having nothing to do with racism, watch ""Zardoz""."

Crash is ""Do The Right Thing"" without the perspective, infused with ""Six Degrees of Sepparation""'s novelty that our lives are all interconnected somehow, underpinned by a sliced-and-diced time line that's really getting overused these days.<br/><br/>The characters were seemingly ordered from a catalog: you've got your twisted racist veteran cop (Dillon), an idealistic rookie cop (Phillippe), a self-interested DA (Frasier) and his uppity racist socialite wife (Bullock). Each was played per the care tag. And if Queen Latifah has taught us anything, a Real Live Rapper can't hurt. Except in the case of Ludacriss, it does. To his credit Don Cheadle did what he could with his character, but was still required to make his own caustic racist remarks. <br/><br/>That a film like this takes Best Picture speaks more about the dysfunction of the Academy than anything else."

And the fact this won the Oscar for best picture, yet Saving Private Ryan did not, is a monumental wrong doing. This movie was not very good and certainly did not deserve any award nominations. Sure, it is about an important societal issue, racism. But that doesn't mean every movie about racism is good.<br/><br/>This was like a hodge podge of several characters and their stories thrown together and at the end some of the characters overlap stories. We have 2 cops who detain a couple and one cop more or less molests the woman. Later, he saves her life and the other cop has a run in with her husband. We have 2 car jackers, later one runs into the other lady's husband and the other runs into the cop. It turns out he is the brother of another cop that was featured. Another story involves an Arab store owner who goes after a guy who only fixed the lock to his store. His daughter is a dr. who is scene later at the hospital.<br/><br/>Then Sandra Bullock plays this whiny, rich b*tch who I could not stand.

","Crash is the most contrived film I've seen in years. Set in the backdrop of a chilly, snow-forecasted Los Angeles, this movie follows twenty or so people in their everyday lives being miserable to one another and spewing racially-tinged hate at every stressed-out opportunity they have. From the moment Don Cheadle's character tells us that we're all so distant from each other we can only get close if we ""crashed,"" I felt preached to, had my intelligence insulted, and had my suspicions reaffirmed about what's acceptable for Hollywood's Oscar: a ""feel-good"" movie about racism that lets virtually all the characters off the hook, because somehow it's in their nature they will act this way and then another. What a load of baloney.<br/><br/>A basic plot element in film storytelling is that you have a character acting a certain way in act one, a traumatic experience in act two which causes a change in the character in act three. That's standard, expected and completely acceptable. What is not acceptable is repeating this about a dozen times in the same movie with characters who have the depth of a layer of new fallen snow in L.A. It's amazing how shameless this film is in exploiting this point. I found myself laughing derisively through a great deal of this film when characters spout off racial epithets and attitudes at the moment they encounter any amount of stress. And can someone tell me how this film is supposed to be a serious comment on race when the Asian characters are all horribly stereotyped? Dillon's SECOND meeting with the woman he molested and Phillipe's SECOND meeting with her husband both had me howling in laughter (man, they get around. Has L.A. become a small town suddenly?). The sequence with Phillipe's and Tate's characters was the most contrived of all the scenes, contorting itself like a Cirque de Soleil performer to create a tragedy that completely makes no sense except to create the completion of a plot arc that I saw coming from the beginning of the movie. And what is with middle-class Howard's character finding his inner gangsta in an unintentionally hilarious final scene with him? A truly, unbelievably pathetic choice for Best Picture--it doesn't beat the other nominees and doesn't even deserve the Best Original Screenplay Oscar for its Creative Screen writing 101 paper that is its script. No wonder most Hollywood movie writing is sub-par. It's undeserved wins like Crash for Best Picture that are the real reasons why Hollywood is out of touch with mainstream America, not the sex and violence factor."

","I must say that when I heard that a powerful Hollywood drama about racial stereotypes had been released I didn't have high hopes. I've heard it all before quite frankly - 'turns racism on its head', 'really makes you think'. Yeah, whatever. But I read some great reviews so rented it on video. Now this film is not a complete calamity - it's nicely shot for one thing - but quite why people are feting this film as some sort of cinematic masterpiece is extraordinary. But no more extraordinary than the earnest, self-important view that the film sees to have of itself. The absurd life-affirming music at the end would have fitted perfectly a genuine epic where you have seen the characters change and grow. But the problem with Crash is that there are simply too many characters to care about any of them. And they are all so horribly clichéd - the wisecracking, funny blacks, the desperate Arab, the hard working Hispanic, the racist and overworked white - that it makes a mockery of viewing racism in a different way. The more I think about this film the less I like it so I'll stop now and leave my 3 out of 10 before I reconsider and give it a two..."
"brainofj72","3","9","17","25 January 2006"," Heavy-Handed, Self-Righteous Garbage
","Crash. The film that confronts racism in a gut-wrenching and mature manner. The film that makes us take a harsh look at ourselves as a race. The film that is superbly crafted in every way. The film of 2004.<br/><br/>Right? Wrong.<br/><br/>What did I see when I watched Crash? I saw a slew of recycled racial stereotypes. I saw a sophomoric script. I saw direction on par with an episode of whatever television drama is ""in"" right now. I saw the same concept of interweaving L.A. subplots that has been done so many times (and so much better) by other filmmakers. I saw one of the worst films of 2004.<br/><br/>Crash is the story of a handful of Los Angeles residents and how their lives intertwine over a period of time. All coming from various ethnic backgrounds, these characters are confronted with intense racism both directed at and emitted from them.<br/><br/>Having missed the film in theaters, I was inspired to view it after all of the intense debate among critics, some claiming it as an A+ masterpiece, others claiming it as F-grade garbage. I had to decide for myself. While I do not think the film is a complete failure, it certainly is nowhere near even B-grade material, let alone A.<br/><br/>After the first ten minutes, it was already fairly apparent that this film wasn't exactly subtle. We have an altercation in a gun store as a man of middle-eastern descent attempts to purchase a firearm and is berated by the storeowner, who loudly calls him ""Osama."" We see a white cop pulling over a couple that were engaging in a sexual act while driving and feeling up the wife, and afterward, the wife screams at her husband saying that the only reason it happened was because he thought she was a white woman, and he didn't like the idea of her fellating a black man.<br/><br/>If these blatant attempts at affecting us aren't enough, writer/director Paul Haggis also presents us with a pair of young black males. One a sensitive youth, one a rather stereotypical ""gangsta"". As they travel the sidewalks of an upper-class portion of L.A., the former explains to the latter about how all white people hate black people and how this is proved by the fact that they didn't receive as many coffee refills as other people in the restaurant they had just dined at. He spews out some more talk of how horrible it is to be black, and then they pull out pistols and steal an SUV. Wow, that's some real subtle irony right there, Haggis.<br/><br/>Now, I realize Haggis tried to focus in on prejudiced people, but what he does in Crash is just ridiculously over-the-top. This is the twenty-first century, not 1930's Alabama, here. Is all these people ever think or talk about related to race issues? They're not exactly presented as dynamic characters. This also makes it hard to care about anyone in the film. If they're all just a bunch of degenerates, why should I care? And of course, by the end of the film, all of these characters have undergone a miraculous catharsis and have become wonderful human beings.<br/><br/>Yeah. Sure.<br/><br/>And again, as I stated earlier, this technique of interweaving mini-stories in Los Angeles has been far better in the past. Short Cuts, anyone? Magnolia? On top of being insultingly heavy-handed, Crash commits another celluloid sin: it's just plain easy. How hard is it to tug at the audience's heartstrings when you have a cute, innocent little girl being shot? Then all one has to do is cue up some Enya-esquire music, and voila!  you've got something the critics are guaranteed to become rabid over.<br/><br/>Any sophomore in high school, if asked to write a story about racism, could have written a script as simple and obvious as Crash.<br/><br/>Also, as I stated earlier, on top of having severe script problems, Haggis' direction is straight out of a television drama. It's all above-the-shoulder close-ups and shaky hand-held.<br/><br/>However, I do not feel it is fair to give this film an F grade for two factors: the gorgeous cinematography, which results in some great visuals of Los Angeles, and the fabulous cast, which delivers some damn fine performances. Of course, they are utterly wasted on this trash.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the hype, for Crash is a film that does anything but live up to it. Unless of course, you want a film in which all the intricacies of the narrative are spoon-fed to you off a silver platter. Oh wait, in order for that to be the case, the narrative has to be intricate. Nevermind."
"FilmSnobby","3","15","32","22 May 2005"," *Magnolia* without the frogs.
","*Crash*, by Paul Haggis, is one of those slice-of-life, twelve-characters-in-search-of-a-connection sort of thing, and, as is usually this case with these type of movies, is rather poorly done. The movie has many antecedents, but the most obvious has to be P.T. Anderson's *Magnolia*. Both movies share an unearned sense of doom, a gloomy tone, overwrought histrionics, and even apocalyptic stuff falling from the sky in Los Angeles (I won't spoil it, but at least there are no frogs in *Crash*).<br/><br/>While *Magnolia* -- itself cribbed from Altman's *Short Cuts* -- tried to sustain its multi-level storyline with a theme about the interconnectedness of humanity even within the spacious confines of suburban L.A., *Crash* takes as its impetus the daily round of racial antipathy seething under the Superpower sheen of American life. Obviously, the latter is a more vital and inherently interesting topic, which makes *Crash* a more inherently interesting movie, probably (but then, what ISN'T better than *Magnolia*?). The movie certainly gets interesting whenever it deigns to follow either Don Cheadle or Matt Dillon (and we are grateful Dillon has been given a decent role -- it's been a while) within its 24-hour time-frame. Tellingly, both Cheadle and Dillon are in law enforcement: the former being a world-weary detective, the latter being a world-weary, racist beat cop. Which leads one to the conclusion that Haggis should have focused his film on how law enforcement contributes to the racial animosity in this country. The side-story, for instance, about the Iranian shopkeeper is merely post-Iraq-War political posturing (count on it, someone accuses him of waging jihad early in the film when he's buying a pistol at a gun store). Rapper Ludicrous, of all people, inveighing against hip-hop dumbing down African-American culture is the worst sort of didactic pontificating, especially when one considers that these slyly racist remarks are put in his mouth by white filmmakers. (Haggis is a lily-white Canadian.) And then there's Sandra Bullock, a spoiled and pampered wife of the D.A., who must endure getting her car jacked by the aforementioned Ludicrous and getting her locks changed by a Mexican guy with a tattoo. Even worse, her Latina housekeeper leaves the dishes in the dishwasher instead of putting them in the cupboards after they're washed. Just how much listening to Bullock complain about housekeepers will contribute to the audience's internal debate about race relations is anybody's guess.<br/><br/>Ironically, *Crash* gets good whenever the racial issues are rendered secondary by good old-fashioned cinematic values. There are at least two terrifically exciting scenes in the movie: the first involves Dillon rescuing Thandie Newton in an overturned car; the second involves bleeding-heart cop Ryan Phillipe (Dillon's former partner) moderating a standoff between Newton's husband and a group of pistol-brandishing LAPD. These scenes are well-staged and intense . . . but then one recalls the massive amount of coincidences that require two cops -- former partners who had a nasty encounter with this same couple the night before -- to come to the rescue of these individuals in different parts of what is one of the largest cities in the world. I suppose one can blame this on the movie's unfortunate structure, but very little about *Crash* is particularly likely, anyway. In a culture that has relegated talk of race to the psychopathic margins, all the frank discussion going on here is grievously unrealistic. One of Cheadle's white superiors -- one of the movie's ""good guys"", presumably -- even mutters ""Black people!"" under his breath in Cheadle's presence. Uh, fat chance, Haggis. A true movie about race relations in 2005 in the USA would, of course, never mention the color of someone's skin. But wherever shameless didacticism goes, praise from the tasteless must follow, I guess.<br/><br/>3 stars out of 10. P.S.: It's sadly fitting, given the movie under review, that IMDb's spell-checker is changing ""Ludacris"" to ""Ludicrous"". Draw your own conclusions!"

"nycritic","10","11","22","12 April 2006"," Man Against Man, Headed for a Collision Course
","Film as media capturing a snapshot of a given moment in society: this is what Paul Haggis' film CRASH (not to be confused with David Cronenberg's much different film of the same name as it is not a remake) is all about.<br/><br/>How many times have you gone through your everyday activities when suddenly something happens -- a car hits yours, you get mugged, you experience condescension from someone, you have a bad day which only gets worse as the day moves on, or you see even more terrorism occurring through the mirror of television and immediately start eyeballing people of a specific race because they ""look"" like terrorists? I know I have, and have on more than one occasion caught myself holding my mouth before I spoke the damning words because it so happens, when seeing Jennifer Esposito's character Ria, I was reminded of my own Latino ethnicity. Her partner, Graham (played by Don Cheadle) calls her Mexican; she immediately corrects him that she is not, she is El Salvadorean and Puerto Rican. And there is a big difference. It's a little moment, but one that escalates in magnitude when dealing with people on a daily basis.<br/><br/>Such is the story -- and series of stories -- caught in the middle of CRASH. In a city like Los Angeles -- much like in another big city -- there are people from everywhere trying to make life a little better for themselves and their loved ones. Of course, every major city has slums and bad neighborhoods and sometimes things get out of control. Authorities, in trying to maintain order, don't always employ the people they should, and then again, one loose cannon will, in his or her hatred for people who come from a different background as they -- most notably black and/or Hispanic -- step over the lines of appropriate law enforcement while a real crime occurs not blocks away from them. This is what happens to Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), a cop who's been on the business for nearly almost his life and has gone jaded. While the film presents him as the quintessential bad cop, subtle shades of his misplaced anger come through later on. It's again, something that has happened to all of us no matter how politically correct we would like to consider ourselves. In all of us there is the potential to lash out at that one person who has nothing to do with us, who was just there, who was an easy target.<br/><br/>The people whom he lashes out to are the Thayers (Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard), a young black couple who live on Ventura Blvd. In response to the report of a stolen SUV belonging to Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock's characters, stolen by Anthony and Peter (Chris Bridges and Larenz Tate) who also have more up their sleeve than their characters suggest), Ryan and his partner Tom Hanson (Ryan Philippe) tail the vehicle even though it's the wrong one. What sparks the incident is seeing Christine Thayer (a light-skinned black woman) come up from what seems to be a compromising position. Ignoring their story -- that they were coming back from a party and that he is a television director -- her haughtiness prompts Ryan to touch her inappropriately while Cameron Thayer looks on, unable to do anything. Hanson reports the incident, but his boss, who interestingly happens to be black (Keith David) gives him little reassurance because Ryan is a model officer and he's not about to jeopardize his own career.<br/><br/>More incidents of misplaced anger or preconceptions occur. David (Michael Pena), a locksmith, gets the short end of the stick when installing locks not only by the upper class (Bullock), but by a Persian immigrant. Cameron Thayer continues to get ill-treated by life as a television producer (Tony Danza) tells him that a black character ""doesn't sound black enough"" but then again -- Thayer doesn't, either. Bullock berates her Latina maid, and Dillon has another showdown with another black woman (Loretta Devine) because his father is ill and they've already started on the wrong foot when addressing each other. Anthony and Peter run over a Chinese man standing outside his van and throw him at a hospital's door. Later on, Anthony steals the Chinese man's van and finds something surprising in there. It's only when a moment of catharsis occurs that the character's internal crises hit a head, some with good results, some with bad results. Christine, increasingly disillusioned by Cameron, sees her marriage begin to fall apart and drives right into an accident only to have her life changed when Ryan steps in and saves her from certain death. Cameron on the other hand, gets in even worse with the cops when Anthony and Peter steal his vehicle and won't leave. Hanson lets him go, but the wound is there. He's just another black man in a town that sees him as a hood and not a professional.<br/><br/>CRASH doesn't try to settle matters too neatly, though. Even when some story lines end in a better place than they were when the movie begins, some others end in tragedy, but the slice of life look of the movie in which events take place within a two-day time frame demands a realistic approach. We eventually come to realize that many of the less sympathetic characters in CRASH act the way they do because they are either impotent to help their loved ones or because they've allowed the superficialness of life and their own prejudices to take over their outlook. Even so, like David's young daughter who puts herself in harm's way over a misunderstanding between her daddy and his Persian client, CRASH takes a hopeful approach. We as a society are in trouble, but we also have the power and the hope to make them change. It's not a sentimental approach: these things happen every day in the news, the little miracles of life."
"melissa_mansir","5","11","22","12 May 2005"," Crash? How about Trainwreck?
","Perhaps the most striking and jarring stereotype revealed by this film is the filmmaker's own apparent belief that the American public is completely incapable of understanding subtlety. This is not so much a movie as a sledgehammer assault to the head. I was not offended as a white person, or as a woman, or as a resident of Los Angeles, but as an intelligent person capable of comprehending undertone, facial expression, and unforced dialogue.<br/><br/>While Haggis makes the astute observation that our quotidian lives are charged with many levels of racial prejudice and misunderstanding, the words coming from these characters' mouths are as misplaced as the movies that attempt to have modern characters speaking in iambic pentameter. Who are the characters in Crash? Certainly not any of the Angelenos I know. No one spends their entire day pontificating about race, even if the subject is always there, bubbling just under the surface. No one uses these characters' vocabulary, nobody is so one- dimensional. Is it too much to ask that Hollywood create a movie that deals with race without making race itself the only character with any sort of definition and development? Why are we hit over the head with the concept of race but leave the theater wondering who the hell those poor souls were, and on which vacuous studio lot, in whose overly eager brain, we can find them?"
"gregsrants","9","21","48","24 April 2005"," Powerful and Provocative
","It might be too early to being talking about one of the best films of the year, but if the shoe fits, then Paul Haggis' new film Crash feels like that pair of shoes at the back of the closet too comfortable to throw away. Ironically, comfortable is about the last thing you are going to feel by the time the end credits roll.<br/><br/>In the vein of P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, Crash follows multiple characters through various story lines that intercept during the course of two days in Los Angeles. The common thread between all the players is the deep rooted bigotry and racism that each person exhibits. Whether it is the L.A.P.D. cop who's frustration with a black medical center clerk leads him to take out his anger on a black couple during a routine stop or the white socialite who reveals her distrust with the Hispanic locksmith, Haggis weaves an angry tale of people of all races that are have stereotype opinions on nationalities not their own.<br/><br/>Although there is no particular plot line that is at the epicenter of the film, Don Chedale as Detective Graham does get the most screen time. Starting the film investigating the murder of a young man dumped at the side of the road, we follow Graham through his arms length relationship with partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito), his involvement with a white police officer that has shot and killed a corrupt black cop and his rise through the department thanks to the Assistant District Attorney, Rick (Brandon Fraser) who extends an offer of title to Graham more for the color of his skin rather than his achievements in the field.<br/><br/>But maybe most interesting is the storyline with Matt Dillon resurrecting his career as Officer Ryan. Responsible for his aging and ailing father, Ryan follows a path of self destruction and ends up violating the rights of a young black woman (Thandie Newton in one of the many standout performances in the film) only to later have to come to the aide of the same woman after a traffic accident the following day. Ryan is a man in conflict. His lack of understanding why the world could be so unfair leads him to lash out at other cultures. But his duty to serve and protect in the time of need reveals a man who sees no color only a responsibility based on his oath of uniform.<br/><br/>No nationality is really let off easy in Crash. Whites, blacks, Middle Easterners and even Asians are seen as cultures that would seem to prefer to live in a world that consisted only of their own kind. They argue amongst themselves about how they are perceived by different races, and do not relent in their bias towards anything different.<br/><br/>Crash is, in a word, provocative. You can't help but want to talk about the film at its conclusion, and that is probably the best compliment that Paul Haggis would want to receive. As ugly as each character is portrayed for their hatred, each situation is explained without being condoned. Like the black television director that is bombarded with comments on his loss of blackness his wife through to the producer of the show. Of all the characters he has the biggest change of view from beginning to end as he forgoes his own life of harmony mentality to take on the police and other blacks who try to rob him of his dignity.<br/><br/>No easy task for a first time director, but Haggis gets the best out of his ensemble. Sandra Bullock in her small role as the ADA's wife is the best she has ever been and rapper Ludicrous and Larenz Tate as the two car jackers show great range and offer the few lightened moments in a film heavy on theme.<br/><br/>Movies released in the first half of the year, rarely get noticed come golden statue hand-out time, but Crash should follow in the footsteps of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind and at very least get a best screenplay nod.<br/><br/>But in lieu of any formal recognition, one thing is certain. Paul Haggis on the heels of his writing of last years best film Million Dollar Baby and now with Crash in his directing debut, is the new hot ticket in Hollywood and we will be hearing about him for a long time to come.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"
"wes-connors","7","5","8","22 March 2009"," Los Angeles Smacked Upside the Face
","Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is an insulting picture. It seeks to say something meaningful about racism run rampant in Los Angeles. Did somebody put something in the water? Something that only a Los Angeles snowfall could wipe away? Nearly every character in the film is motivated by ignorant, bigoted instincts. Things get started with a car crash and a carjacking - with people of different ethnic groups colliding get it? The first real grabber occurs when two carjackers (Ludacris & Larenz Tate) draw guns and jack a car - not very shocking, but these two don't impress you as carjackers which could be part of the point, or not...<br/><br/>A more shocking scene has two policeman (Matt Dillon & Ryan Phillippe) pulling over a couple for lollipopping in their automobile. The wife (Thandie Newton) who ""went down"" is roughly ""felt up"" by the abusive cop (Dillon), while her husband (Terrence Howard) is forced to watch on, apologetically. Later, the abusive cop is offered ""salvation"", in a laughably conceived scene. Elsewhere, a snooty (Sandra Bullock) socialite finds friendship and redemption in the arms of her housekeeper. A small businessman (Shaun Toub) man feels supernatural forces ""saved"" him from shooting a little girl dead. One of the carjackers becomes a martyr...<br/><br/>The only character with a story worth telling is the locksmith (Michael Peña) seeking a better life for his family; although, you can make out three or four good stories buried in the mix. The film has no focal character (it should have been the role played by Don Cheadle). It is obvious and lacking humor. And, its overdriven theme is outmoded and unfair. ""Crash"" drives a stake through its own heart by failing to realize its story is primarily about social and cultural class, rather than the loathsome thing hoisted up on the screen. So, why a relatively high ranking? The production, direction (Haggis), photography (J. Michael Muro), and performances are often excellent.<br/><br/>******* Crash (9/10/04) Paul Haggis ~ Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard"

","How this pretentious little montage of contrived melodramas ever pulled off a Best Picture Oscar is positively beyond me, particularly considering the infinitely superior films there were to choose from. Credit, or perhaps blame, must be given to writer Paul Haggis, who also wrote Million Dollar Baby, and from whom we might have expected more. Instead, Haggis reaches into a bag of vapid tricks honed through decades of writing pap for the small screen and assembles what is basically an excruciatingly long episode of one of his dreary television soap operas. This is clearly a writer's indulgence; mental masturbation without a shred of human insight.<br/><br/>The performances are game, and not even Robert Altman could have assembled a more impressive pile of talent to pump something into nothing. In the end, Crash has all the subtlety of an Oliver Stone movie, which is to say, none. Thank you Mr. Haggis for this facile diatribe that inartfully delivers nothing more than the painfully obvious; prejudice is bad."

"ironhorse_iv","7","3","4","10 February 2015"," This movie isn't as good as I remember. It kinda crash hard for me. It was just alright.
","After rewatching it, I have to say, it's not Best Picture material as people make it out to be. This movie was a hard sit through with its tough loud and brash language and racist overtones. I found it to be very annoying. A self-described ""passion piece"" for Director Paul Haggis, Crash was inspired by a real-life incident, in which his Porsche was carjacked outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard in 1991 where he saw racism, first handed. The movie tells a fictional story of number of Los Angeles citizens with vastly separate lives colliding with each other in interweaving stories about race, loss and redemption. I like how the film makes it everybody is tied with each other, but the whole interlocking story device isn't really that innovative when Crash come out. Hyperlink cinema has a long history in Hollywood, and in the right hands, could be clever. Films like 1994's Pulp Fiction, 1999's Magnolia and 2000's Traffic were able to do this, very correctly. Crash interlocking story arch felt clunky and unclear of itself. It doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a serious melodrama. The movie has this holier-than-thou attitude that I didn't like, with its story. It's telling the audience that racism is bad in a heavy-handed and preachy way, but yet, the writer for this film, put in funny ethic jokes for the audience to laugh at. They make you laugh at racism joke, and then the film goes all serious, and condemn you for laughing at it, minutes later. The film felt disconnected in that regard. Very hypocritical and very manipulative in the way, the film was edited. Besides that, it's nice to see the filmmakers, showcase, that minorities could also be racists, too. It's nice to see that movie isn't all about 'white guilt'. The film really extremely showcase racism, but fails to bring anything new to the discussion, like how to solve that problem. It seem mostly founded in making the audience feel as guilty as hell or angry for things that they personally didn't do. It is reasons like this movies, that there's still so much racism in society. It's because animosity never goes away. Somebody always trying to stir the pot. We get it, 'racism is bad'. The race card topic is pretty well-worn by 2004. Let racism die down already, Hollywood. Another problem with this film is that it fails to be a story. First off, the movie has no main plot, but a series of sub-plots that often never get resolved. The plot twists often felt cheap. The movie often felt like it was jarring with itself, pacing wise. Lots of slow pace filler scenes to fill in the run-time. This movie has way too many characters to follow, making it hard to remember who they are. None of them are really well-written, because of the little time, spent with each character. They felt like very offensive stereotype caricatures than real people. The film makes it worst, by making them so unlikeable, showing more of their faults, than their goods. Characters like angry white cop, John Ryan (Matt Dillon), idiotic and dangerous shop-owner Farhab (Shaun Toub), the rich, WASP snob bitch, Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock), and the gangsta hoodlum, Anthony (Ludacris) were so unpleasant. They really turn me off from the film to the point that I didn't care about their story arch. For a film with a socially conscious message, it's quite insensitive in how it portrays certain races. Its sucks that the movie doesn't have any strong Asian leads, because most of Asians, portray in this film are treated worse than any other race in this film. The only character, I found myself, rooting for was the hard-working, family-oriented Hispanic, Daniel Ruiz (Michael Pena). I really hate the fact that Farhab call Daniel's daughter, his angel. The movie already makes him look like a psycho. I was actually surprised that such a mediocre firm was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar and won. Crash won the Best Picture Oscar at the 78th Academy Awards, controversially beating the critically favored Brokeback Mountain. It's hard to believe that films like 1998's American History X wasn't nominated for Best Picture, but films like this, were. In my opinion, this film was OK for critical acclaim, but it didn't deserve the Oscar for being the best film of the year. Overall: It was indeed social relevant. It was so popular that in 2008, a 13-episode series titled 'Crash' premiered on the Starz network with a similar concept. Crash does showed depth. It's not that bad of a movie. It showed that everyone can have prejudice, and can still be good in other ways. Crash is an Important Film that something profound to say. Despite all the faults, it has. It's still a semi well-made movie. I just wish, it could had been better."
"Rebel_With_A_Cause_94","6","3","4","1 December 2013"," Not Worthy Of Winning ""Best Picture""
","Out of all the films that didn't deserve to win the title of Best Picture at the Academy Awards, Crash takes the cake for being the most undeserving.<br/><br/>I admired how ambitious it was and the performances are fantastic, but it's so melodramatic that it becomes hard to take serious and at times just frustrating to watch. The subject matter here is interesting, but it's handled in such a preachy and pretentious way. To make matters worse, the film doesn't really go anywhere by the end of it's nearly 2 hour runtime and ultimately feels rather pointless.<br/><br/>It's worth a watch alone for the performances, but how this won (let alone nominated) an Academy Award for Best Picture is beyond me."

","I saw this movie back in 2004 and I remember leaving the movie theater with a bad taste in my mouth. I was completely taken aback by the way that the Korean couple was portrayed in such a complex, dramatic movie where all the other characters have a three dimensional story line in a movie that is essentially about, well, racism. The fact that the director took pains to address this issue but completely mashed in all the stereotypes he could in regards to Koreans (and for all Asians, for that matter), made me sick. Being a Korean-American myself, I was excited to see that Koreans were included in the story line, but I saw how the Korean couple was purely used for comedic relief, showing them as idiotic, evil and one-dimensional as possible. To this day, nine years after watching this movie, I still shake my head when I remember it. I don't think any other film has extracted this reaction from me. My respect for Paul Haggis is ZERO, especially because the movie takes place in LA, city where the largest population of Koreans live outside of Korea. He really could have shown the nuances of one of the most populous races in the city."
"samalden-spector","1","3","4","4 March 2013"," Not Good At All
","Crash is a film about society that embraces stereotypes, yet sustains the moralizing appeal of an after school special. It is an out-of-touch, moralistic parable of race fused with a bad action movie and injected with a lot of casual racism in an attempt to achieve credibility. Very much like the Green Mile, it is a picture that everyone except for hard-core bigots can get behind and feel good watching, because it fails to characterize, identify or address any meaningful race related issue on which there might be any controversy or discomfort. I can't imagine how anyone with any self-reflection could enjoy one minute of this movie."
"bgledhil","2","10","20","25 August 2006"," Crash is a car-wreck of a movie
","Crash strikes me as a movie devised purely as an Oscar-nabbing vehicle. I found the constant onslaught of racist outbursts and histrionics from the various characters just too over-the-top. Having never been to L.A., I can't comment on whether this is an accurate depiction of everyday tension there, however I simply found the situations that director Paul Haggis has concocted overly contrived, tiresome and improbable. Subtle he ain't, and that appears to be his intention. <br/><br/>The intersecting characters/story-lines approach has been done before, and in far-superior films, most notably Robert Altman's ""Shortcuts"". I found two scenes in particular utterly ruined this movie: First, the coincidental nick-of-time arrival of scum-bag cop Matt Dillon to gallantly rescue Thandie Newton, was beyond ""clumsy plot device"" status. It's as if Haggis has taken a cocktail party conversation far too literally: ""Yes, that Matt Dillon character may be a corrupt racist, but given the chance, he wouldn't hesitate to risk his own life to pull a woman from a burning car"". Gosh, wasn't it awfully convenient that there was such a burning car (which happened to have Thandie Newton in it) the very next day to prove this? I felt truly embarrassed for Haggis by this scene. Are we supposed to understand that this is an allegory, is too fantastic to actually occur, and that this is Haggis' ham-fisted way of making a point about people's duality?<br/><br/>The other high cringe factor scene is Terrence Howard as the successful television director who gets pushed too far, and winds up in a stand-off with LA cops. OK, so he's had a frightening and humiliating episode. This is presumably enough to push him over the edge and go from level-headed TV professional one day, to suicidal, gun-brandishing desperado the next? Sorry, I don't buy it. (Terrence Howard is great in other films, such as Hustle and Flow). <br/><br/>To be fair, I think Haggis' subject matter is crucial and definitely requires examination. His intent (other than Oscar-related) is noble; however his sledge-hammer execution is inept and wholly unsatisfying. In the end, I found myself cringing twice - once after sitting through this movie, and again when it won the best picture Oscar."

Not that do people from the US care about a Mexican's opinion, and I'm really from Mexico, not from Puerto Rico nor any other Latin American country.<br/><br/>I almost missed the incredible experience of seeing it on theater. Wow! It's been one of the best cinematographic experiences I've had. And yes, it has its flaws, but I think we all go to the movies to enjoy the experience, not to criticize every scene, every technical detail.<br/><br/>For those who say the film is predictable, well, you were not involved in the movie, then. And it must be boring for you to go to the movies and know what's going next. I pity you.<br/><br/>For those who say all characters are stereotyped, well, think about this. We see stereotypes in people we don't know. Yeah, we have friends who are black, Latin, Asian, or other race, and we know they are not like they are shown in the film. But what about the people we don't know? we refuse to have contact with them, due to the stereotypes we have. Think really about it. That's what the movie is about, how we treat the people we don't know, how we reject them without really knowing them, avoiding contact, and this because of our prejudices.<br/><br/>Too many coincidences? well, it's a movie, it's a fable. it had to be like that. And you're not paying attention to the people around you, but it happens in big cities. People are not that distant from each other.<br/><br/>The music, the editing, the acting, and the writing were simply superb. I really can't understand why some people don't appreciate all of that.<br/><br/>I loved this film! and it really hurts to see how some people treats it like trash... as they surely treat people they don't know similarly.<br/><br/>Crash.... a truly deserving Oscar winner."
"james-pogue","1","10","20","19 March 2006"," Overrated Film
","Upon first glance Crash looks like a brilliant film. Not only did it deal with sensitive issues, but the close to flawless acting made the film seem real. However, this film has some huge flaws, making it one of the worst movies ever to win an Academy Award for best picture.<br/><br/>First, the characterizations where very poor. A film is supposed to make you care about the characters and as a result fell happy or sad about what happens to them. However, this film deals with bigotry and stereotypes in a manipulative way. In this film you aren't angry or upset that a character is hurt/killed/marginalized, you are simply angry or upset at the basic principle of racism or stereotypes. As a result, this movie fails to be character driven, but issue driven, which destroys a lot of the emotional power that could have been there.<br/><br/>Second, the underlying theme surrounding the word ""Crash"" is just stupid. The movie is trying to say that the only way people can get used to each other and jump over hurdles such as racism, is ""crashing"" into each other. This is just a poor reflection on society. We ARE a racist country with fundamental problems, but it is not because we are scared of other races/ethinicites, but because we are tied to the arbitrary meaning of existence."

You can't believe that Cheadle who is the very picture of decency as an actor can have a bad trait in him - when he 'insults' his girlfriend by calling her a Mexian (she's a Puerto Rican-El Salvadorean) you know he doesn't mean it.<br/><br/>Which is what the whole movie is about - none of these people really mean what they say, they are just trying to reach out to each other.

The silliness from the magic clock on the little girl, to the blank bullets and dumping of the Asian immigrants in the middle of Los Angeles left me cringing. The fact that this after school special peppered with profanity won for best picture at the Oscars has left me numb with disbelief. The fact that Crash won over the brilliance of Brokeback Mountain has left me stunned. It really must be true about the rampant homophobia and bigotry of academy voters who wanted anything but Brokeback Mountain to take home best picture.

","I enjoyed Million Dollar Baby very very much, and was very excited to watch Paul Haggis' new work. However I came out frustrated and confused. his movie illustrates Haggis' own prejudice. The Asian Americans in the movie were portrayed as sub-human. Unlike the other racial groups, there was redemption or dignity, no progress in their faults. Asian characters however, were shown in extreme caricature, whether as a belligerent annoying old Asian lady, or as a greedy little guy who sells his own people. As I watched it, I felt like Thandie Newton's character being fondled by the cop--humiliated and not being able to do a damn thing but watch. The time they did spend on Asian Americans were spent portraying them as villains, or as primates in a cage. Why include them only to vilify them?<br/><br/>To say this movie is unauthentic is a total understatement. I live in Los Angeles, and this is total crap. This is just as authentic as Madagascar, which will be a better buy for your buck. <br/><br/>the movie itself had its moments but it is too much of a contrived piece of work, always pretentious in its authenticity (ooooh its so realistic and gritty).

","I really don't know how this movie won an Oscar for best picture. Both ""Capote"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" were far far superior to this film. I even thought ""Matchpoint"" was better and that wasn't even nominated. I felt like I was watching an after-school special, not an Oscar winning Hollywood movie. I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought the characters were thin and unrealistic. I thought the message was ridiculous, if there really was a message. Every white racist I know liked this film because they can relate to the Matt Dillon character. By the way, Matt Dillon isn't an actor, he just plays Matt Dillon in every movie he is in. You would think that someone that has been around as long as he has would eventually improve their acting skills. I think he is just getting worse and worse. I also don't like Sandra Bullock, she is another terrible actress, too bad very talented actors such as Don Cheadle gets wasted in such a terrible movie."

There is no third act, it becomes a music video--which explains part of its popularity--it must be confusing if you grew up on MTV to tell the difference between that and a real movie. The racial issues get very superficial treatment. One well known Los Angeles African-American activist called it ""shallow and dangerous"". I couldn't agree more. This is the limousine liberal view of racism. ""Why cant we all just get along?"" You want to watch a movie about racism, see ""Do the Right Thing"". You wanna see an Altman movie, see ""Short Cuts"". This film stans up to neither."

"evilspaceman","5","9","18","19 May 2005"," A no brains, overly sentimental look at racism in the states
","basically crash is about racism in the states (a worthy subject of analysis). the title ""crash"" probably refers to the clash of ethnic and socio-economic identities and the interpersonal consequences of that collision. i guess at some deeper level i really felt for these ""stereo type anti-stereo-types"" (watch the movie, that's not a typo), but i just couldn't come to grips with how naive this film was; subtle it certainly ain't. is it challenging? well, no. i didn't come outta there thinking: ""boy! did i have American culture figured out all wrong!"" none of my prior held views and opinions were shattered by what this film had to say (in fact it compounded American stereotypes such as insular, environmentally inconsiderate and intolerant). these oil rich imperialists don't like public transport (as one, more poignant moment in the film revealed) or driving around in sensible fuel efficient cars (holla back if u can tell me the make of the black SUV featured in this film!). there's a certain candid innocence about this film that audiences will appreciate particularly as a diversion from an otherwise ridiculous and implausible story (not that it was meant to be 'real' of course). despite this, its nauseatingly sentimental and as for 'social critique' it's about as profound as baked beans on a Friday night watching the footy. it ultimately has no answers to any of the issues it raises and possibly even hinders real social action. ""crash"" consciously steers clear of a political agenda, which a lot of people failed to notice or care much about (or so it seemed from what i heard outside the cinema). throughout the film the audience is kept aloof- above it all- and in this voyeuristic state the connection between economic forces and social imperatives remains subliminal. instead we see a lot of moralistic rhetoric about bad guys who become good and good guys who go bad. sure, lots of melodrama, but is it saying anything? i don't think so. i think it removes racism from its proper macro economic context and rationalises it from a interpersonal/relative/subjective (etc) frame of reference. conscious of this i felt a sense of apathy to these hopelessly clichéd character frauds.<br/><br/>to conclude: don't buy into the hype surrounding this movie. it's not a particularly 'radical' or 'original' take on race issues.yes, people are capable of becoming ""nicer to minorities"" but only if real material redistribution occurs (so less SUV and more public transport). unsurprisingly this was not addressed in the movie. Crash is edgy, its raw, but its covered territory and has about the same intellectual depth as an episode of ER.<br/><br/>19/05/05"

","As an Asian, I found this movie to be highly offensive as Asians were the ONLY minority to not be represented in both a good light and a bad light. Asians are ONLY represented in a bad light in this movie. The take away from this movie is that Asians are: 1) money grubbing, 2) human traffickers, 3) arrogant bigots. Not to say other ethnic groups aren't portrayed in a bad light (the bad cop, the car thieves, the locksmith) but each ethnic group is also then portrayed in a good/redeeming light except for the Asians. the one instance where an attempt was made, still made Asians look like all they cared about was money (hospital scene at the end when the husband, battered and bruised lying in the hospital bed after being run over by his stolen van, tells his wife to hurry and cash the check in the pocket of his clothes."

","This is possibly the most awful movie to ever win the best film Oscar. The film is too dumb to say anything remotely insightful about race relations.<br/><br/>The conversations are implausible, the situations are hysterical, and there was no sense that the writer cared to create three dimensional characters that would actually exist in real life. Each player only exists to serve an easy gimmick: portray each character as an ethnic stereotype and then do a complete character reversal before the end credits. <br/><br/>The whole film is a straw man's argument. It invents a misrepresentation of the real world and then criticizes its own fictitious creation. <br/><br/>Worst of all, with each character so motivated by racial hatred, the audience simply cannot relate or reflect. Real human beings cannot empathize with caricatures. So the film turns the viewers into armchair moralists where we can judge these people on screen without reflecting on our own prejudices, because the viewer is unlikely to go off spewing racial name-calling in the most benign situations like these characters so freely do."

","The film was just average. I think it is such a stretch to conclude that because a movie deals with a tough subject, it is quality. Crash was a series of clichés finely weaved to look like coincidence. In reality, our racial engagements are far more subversive and much more cowardly. Why, because the stakes of misbehavior are so high. This is why racism in public hasn't been dealt with honestly since Rosa Parks sat in the front that bus.<br/><br/>When people ""crash"" racially, we are usually far more bent to the extremes of passive acceptance or a full out class action lawsuit. The actual physical and personal confrontation of racism are usually so powerful you don't need a movie to capture them because they are on the front page of the news. To narrow the realities of the situation to a bunch of predictable comments by pretty actors is just not very respectable."
"bjones","6","8","16","6 March 2006"," What's All the Fuss About?
","After more than the usual hype surrounding a film and after wondering what was so good about this film after it won a few awards I finally broke down and rented it the night before the Academy Awards. I had to rent it because it never aired in theaters in the town where I live. That's not surprising in a place that seems to try and show only kiddie movies. In any event I carried it home with the hope of finding a real gem, after all I had the read the hype.<br/><br/>I have to say that I was more than a little disappointed. I saw nothing at all new here and nothing that was even all that well done with the exception of the construct of coincidence carried to ridiculous levels. The film is a collection of overlapping vignettes (but lacking the requisite subtlety) that purport to describe the condition of racial injustice in society. Instead it comes across like being assaulted by some crazy person getting too close and mumbling tired old clichés at you when you leave a restaurant after a good meal; the delivery is more disturbing than the message. There is nothing here to me that wasn't already old and overwrought in the 1970's.<br/><br/>More unsettling may even be the ineptitude and prejudice of the film-makers. They seem to have one theme in mind and don't mind portraying it even if it's wrong or a bad idea. Take for example the piece concerning the Persian shopkeeper. It begins by showing him illegally buying a firearm in a shop but doesn't expand on his illegality or that of the seller in the manner of the sale. Instead, in a trite twist it later reveals that his daughter bought him a box of blanks for ammunition to go with it. That happens when he tries to shoot a man with it but nothing happens when his daughter accidentally gets in the way. This is just plain irresponsible. Any firearm shooting blanks does in fact expel very dangerous substances from the muzzle at short ranges, enough so to cause serious injury and even death. But they depict it as having no effect whatsoever. That is a great way to mislead naive young people in audiences into believing it and maybe reenacting it with serious injury or death as a result. If you don't think that's true try asking Jon-Erik Hexum, who found out the hard way in 1984. This is just irresponsible to show this in this way.<br/><br/>The rest of the film eschews a muddle of trite old racist stereotypes and shows us examples of what the film makers think are examples of this. The thing was in all the writing I encountered before seeing the film the only place I saw a reference to ""racist"" with regard to the film were references to the Matt Dillon character. As expected, the Matt Dillon character was overtly racist - although it did give some insight to what may have propelled him in that direction. But at least he was openly and unashamedly so. The rest of the characters were more objectionable examples of it. I almost laughed at many of the characters because almost every character in the film was either a ridiculous one-dimensional stereotype or a blatantly one-dimensional racist. For example, the Don Cheadle character was perhaps the worst in the film as he wasn't only racist, but a cop who broke serious laws in accepting bribery from a corrupt city official, who worked for the passively racist Brendan Fraser character - that constituted a conspiracy based on racism; theirs.<br/><br/>No, come to think of it, the most vile character in the film was the Asian man who was buying and selling other Asians. That has to be about as bad as it can get. Those were followed closely by racists such as the characters played by Loretta Devine and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. One of the few characters who were close to ""normal"" was Cameron, played by Terrence Howard, whose performance was worth the rental price along with that of Dillon. Howard even manages to extract a degree of sympathy in a film overflowing with unsympathetic characters.<br/><br/>As for remainder of the film, the overall production quality was better than I expected from a ""low budget"" film. In retrospect I think it was worth the rental price but not the Academy Awards it seemed to steal from a group of much better quality films."
"Aam_Aadmi","5","8","16","5 March 2006"," High-octane drama set in crash-crazy City of Angels
","This film attempts to visually depict what is normally spoken in hushed tones or whispered behind closed doors. In doing so, it uses expletives to the hilt and shoves the R-word down your throat until you choke.<br/><br/>Is that just bad screenplay or poor direction? Perhaps a bit of both as we try to connect all the dots in this puzzling piece. The events in a day on the streets of LA, where a corrupt cop deliberately pulls over and 'whisks' the wrong party, a couple of carjackers steal a Navigator and bump a Chinese pedestrian (but are not caught or pulled over) and a locksmith finishes a couple of door jobs but is unable to fix the real problems behind them, try to build a complex mosaic of activity in this beehive of Corrupt Angels (as per the film-makers).<br/><br/>But the film lacks a uniform voice not so much because the backgrounds or beliefs of the individual characters are radically different. Rather it does not convincingly portray why all these elements happen to be in a particular 'crash scene' at a given moment in time. Mere coincidence? Well, thats left to subjective interpretation. What good is complexity for the sake of complexity? To win awards maybe but not much else.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, its good for one sitting if one can patiently put together all the footprints and tracks into a cohesive whole."
"Quinoa1984","6","8","16","6 November 2005"," well-shot and often well-acted, but it's so subject heavy...
","I had heard so much about Crash over these past months in 2005, seen it pop up repeatedly on top 10 lists, and only heard a couple of reviews from friends or critics saying it was a bad movie. After finally seeing it, I feel like I've seen a film in conflict with itself, which is for better or worse depending on who is watching it. The stories in the film revolve around several characters (ensemble style), including cops, gangsters, foreigners, upper-class types, lower-class types, who get in such conflicts with each other, practically all by racial attitudes and bigotry. It's a tough call for me as a viewer, because I respect the effort that has been put into it, the initial ambition to track the kinds of racial boundaries that make things with people on edge all over America, not just Los Angeles. And performances by the likes of Sandra Bullock (her best since Miss Congeniality 2...just kidding, really top notch), Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton, Matt Dillon, and even Brendan Fraser, go above expectations. The problem I see lies in the script. <br/><br/>Writer/director Paul Haggis, who scored some points for his script of Million Dollar Baby (an adaptation, but one that did have a level of simplicity that helped), sometimes confuses making bold statements by these assorted types as being perfectly modulated alongside the style. The funny thing is, the photography is quite interesting, in its hand-held, quasi-Traffic style, however even under the surface I almost felt there was a kind of TV-movie feel to it that I couldn't shake. Un-like a real masterpiece about racism in America, Do The Right Thing, there aren't many any sidebars (or little details) to the characters really that break up the more tense moments. And it's not just the pile of coincidences that one has to take fully into account, or that many scenes seem like rushed climaxes, but that even when things get dramatically correct and strong (later in the film, when not too melodramatic) it isn't as real as it should be. Maybe I'm missing something, or maybe it's that the movie isn't very subtle, but it's no great film to me. It is good, sometimes provocative, and not in totally in the league of other non-linear films that have come out in the past decade. Grade: B"

","(watched in Toronto)<br/><br/>Paul Haggie's (writer of ""Million Dollar Baby"") directing debut, ""Crash"" is an attempt to be a thought-provoking film about racism. Despite a good cast and good efforts, it succeeds only in showing what racism looks like, but has no in-depth probing into what it really is, not even to the level of the legendary Archie Bunker TV series in the 70s, ""All in the family"", let alone the all time classic ""Guess who is coming to dinner"". (1967)<br/><br/>Quite a few critics condemn the plot for its total lack of common sense credulity – in a city of multi-million population, L.A., the two dozen characters keep bumping into one another as if this were a small rural town. Personally, I do not mind the coincidence, serendipity and all that, looking from the angle of these contrivances being necessary theatrical manipulations to get the ensemble story constructed.<br/><br/>Really lacking is the superficial treatment of the characters, as well as inconsistencies. Haggie wants to show two sides of every human being and there's nothing wrong with that. But take an example in Matt Dillion's character, a racist cop who thinks that Blacks are the cause of everything bad. So far so good. But if you look at his upbringing and if what he says about his father is true, it is totally inconceivable that he would turn out to be the way he is.<br/><br/>The movie is well intentioned, well acted and has some positive messages. Beyond that, however, it does not have much more to offer and is generally overrated.<br/><br/>Finally, just a quick summary of the various interwoven plot lines, using the names of the actors, rather than the characters, for expediency.<br/><br/>1. District attorney Brendan Fraser and wife Sandra Bullock got their car taken form them at gunpoint by two Blacks Ludicrous and Larenz Tate. Bullock's innate prejudice and distrust of minorities is later softened when after slipping and falling down the stairs, she finds that the only help comes from the Latina maid.<br/><br/>2. In danger of being compromised, Fraser forces police officer Don Cheadle to shield him, using as a threat the latter's delinquent brother Ludicrous. Jennifer Esposito is Cheadle's partner at work as well as lover but he never bother to understand her origin, considering ""Mexican"" (which really has nothing to do with her) to be sufficient.<br/><br/>3. Locksmith Michael Pena, after fixing the locks for Bullock's house and earning suspicious glances from her, goes on to work on Iranian Shaun Toub's store. When the store is broken into, not because of the lock be because of the door itself, Toub wants blood and would have killed Rena's 5-year-old daughter had it not been for a lucky mistake in buying the wrong ammunition.<br/><br/>4. Affluent Black couple Terrance Dashon Howard and Thandie Newton encounters racist cop Matt Dillon who molests Newton in a body search at a routine drink-driving check. The couple's relationship stands a severe test as a result of this ordeal. Later, by sheer coincidence, Dillon courageously rescues Newton in an accident when she is trapped in her car that is about to explode.<br/><br/>5. Young cop Ryan Phillippe, Dillon's partner at the same search, cannot stand his bigotry and asks for a new partner. Later, Phillippe courageously diffuses a situation in which innocent Howard is in danger of being shot by police officers. But ironically, Phillippe later picks up hitchhiking Ludicrous and shoots him dead in a misunderstanding.<br/><br/>6. A Korean couple is placed at various junctures, more as Asian tokenism.<br/><br/>That covers most, but not all, of the interwoven plot and characters."

","An Oscar-winner. Of course. What would I expect from the Academy Awards, who's only choice that coincides with mine is 'The Unforgiven'... the rest, in the past 20 years or so, is just a large 'whatever'... (from the nominees to the outfits they wear at the ceremonies...). I guess I am not wired like these people. That's OK, I wouldn't fathom or want to be a part of any 'cinematic' jury, but... OK... this movie, to me, is not a great movie. And even if the other nominated movies weren't that great either, I would have picked any one of them. It isn't a bad movie... It is entertaining, there is action, there is suspense, there is some overtly-manipulative tragedy and a general comic undertone to ease the supposed 'blows', a great little concoction I'd say... for TV! It reminds me of an NBC drama!!! It is void of what I'm looking for in a movie: presence, spontaneity, the fact it searches for an audience and that it isn't just something mass-produced for a prefabricated one. That on the stylistic, narrative side. On the thematic level, I found it simplistic. The treatment of racism... well, it's funny. It feels like the authors are trying to speak about a very complex and difficult, bothersome topic for themselves, but represent it by way of their own stereotypes (first of all), and by way of the relationships, or the racially stunted non-relationships they probably conduct in their short-minded US metropolitan lives, taking as a given that the sheer cosmopolitanism of LA is capable of teaching us (and them) things about racial interaction. It feels autobiographical in a silly way. And lopsided. This is evident in the fact that the better, more developed characters are Matt Dillon and his ex-police partner. It is they who are really being examined, there is a lot of care put into their plots... they are the tragic characters, in a sense, and the black couple is clearly secondary. That would be OK, but there is a pathetic attempt to give them that same importance, and here the film fails miserably. Past these, the rest are just backdrop, (much like in TV where you have a million subplots) they are used for laughs, or for action and suspense, they are pretty much faceless and it feels like they are there to keep all possible age-groups intrigued - so as to 'appeal to all audiences'. I mean, all other character development is sparse, or just plain easy. Once we get to the Persian family... well, there we are really treading on It's-A-Small-World-After-All territory. But see... I wouldn't have mean things to say about this movie if it would have stayed in the format it belongs. But, since it comes out flaunting itself as a gutsy 'film' about racism... it falls prey to its own narrow capsule-minded self. It is unable to tap into the discussion it suggests, it remains hidden in the categories it starts off with. It is childish in this sense. A real film would have been more adventurous. A real + award-worthy film, I mean. <br/><br/>I just think a lot more could have been done. Or perhaps, a lot less. It was sadly crowded with weak plot lines (don't tell me its inspired on Altman... that influence is very much watered down on this one... the direct inspiration would be the much more immediate CSI episodes), 'logorheic' scenes that don't teach us anything, like the ones in the court with Don Cheadle that are supposed to make us despise 'the system' or something. On the other hand, the scene when Dillon is to rescue Tandie Newton... there was something provocative in that, having them look somewhat romantic even, which in my opinion was a touch of grace, probably the best moment in the movie. That was a very intelligent move, and helped the scene a lot... of course, it didn't last (not the moment, but the inspiration in general). In conclusion, I enjoyed it when I saw it. The movie addresses a certain sore that the U.S. has built a whole nation upon, (perhaps all nations do so similarly), something that definitely should be addressed, why not... there were many thoughtful moments. But this to me is a TV film, or a first draft/attempt at something ambitious. And on some level, I feel it was unnecessary to make it about 'racism'. On the other hand, maybe that is what got it the Oscar."

Even worse, the characters criss-cross each other's paths over the course of a day until the whole movie becomes a pretentious bore.<br/><br/>I learned nothing about the nature of racism from this movie other than the fact that the screenwriter(s) and director manipulated the theme to set up a trite and insubstantial vehicle to make money out of the subject. Every character was shown to have a 'dark' and a 'light' side, like the world is black and white. Wouldn't it be great if racism were that simple? I won't pretend that a cheap movie like Crash has any worth outside the world of entertainment."

","I am surprised at the negative review on the opening page. This is a masterpiece by Haggis and worth many repeated views. He does a classic job behind the camera and weaves a gripping tale of inter connected stories. The fact that an action which might seem of little consequence can go on to be pivotal for somebody else is the underlying current of this film.It's not about racial discrimination as some reviews might suggest, though that is a sub plot.You shouldn't look for a hidden social message in this film. But if you are looking for an entertaining story that grips and touches you deeply, this is highly recommended. Very seldom one comes across a movie that's edge of the seat stuff without being an action thriller. This movie certainly is.It's brilliantly directed and makes you feel the emotions each character is going through beautifully. You feel for the characters and empathise with them. The twists, turns and surprises are very, very well done. If you happen to read this review, just go for it. And ignore the opening review, it's not accurate."

","In Paul Haggis's Crash, people are neither good nor evil, but merely stressed-out. The film is a morality play for the era of Dr. Phil; the characters are placed in morally dicey situations by their inability to develop coping skills. In one scene, a racially insensitive cop, played by Matt Dillon (good to know he's still breathing), gets a little too hands-on with the wife (Thandie Newton) of a TV director (Terrence Howard) he's pulled over; his failure to control his impulses at this juncture has something to do with his frustration over his father's illness, and the way he's treated by the secretary at his HMO (the secretary is black, and so are the director and his wife). But this doesn't necessarily make Dillon a bad guy. In a later scene, Dillon rescues Newton from a burning car despite the danger to his own life. Duality of man anyone? <br/><br/>Haggis' point is only-too-obvious: most people are neither good nor bad by nature, but are the product of their circumstances, and are therefore capable of great heroism as well as great ugliness. Dillon takes advantage of Newton because the opportunity presents itself, because being a cop has made him arrogant, because his outrage at being mistreated by a black woman makes him feel justified in taking out his anger at another black woman (such is the essence of racism). But when he climbs inside the crashed car and finds Newton there, a completely different, self-sacrificing impulse overtakes him. At no other time during Crash does the film become so thematically crystalline. We're all in this together, Paul Haggis is saying, whether we want to admit it or not. It makes no difference that we tend to snipe at each other, to be overcome by racial paranoia, to assert ourselves out of a sense of authority or privilege, or just plain everyday pissiness. <br/><br/>The film makes a huge point of humanity's interconnectedness; the plot is essentially a series of unlikely, but thematically necessary, coincidences and chance encounters. Terrence Howard, having been made to feel vulnerable, unmanly and, what's worse, unblack by his wife's mistreatment, is driven to confront a pair of car-jackers, the eminently black Larenz Tate and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, the very same wise-cracking thugs who previously jacked a car belonging to D.A. Brendan Fraser and his frantic wife Sandra Bullock, the latter of whom hires a locksmith, Michael Pena, to install new locks in the house, etc., The result of these narrative acrobatics is a film that can often seem blurry in the short-term, but has a focus, a sense of purpose that asserts itself in the long-run. There are undeveloped characters all over the place, situations that seem like they could be interesting but go nowhere, performances that have no chance to acquire shading, yet the movie rises above these shortcomings. Director Paul Haggis has woven his situations together fluidly, and achieved a sometimes electrifying sense of urgency. The pieces may sometimes seem irrelevant by themselves, but they all fit into the mosaic, and contribute to the sense of building meaning.<br/><br/>That being said, there's still a nagging sense of smallness to the proceedings. Maybe it's just the way the movie is structured; despite Haggis's proficiency, his ability to weave the different threads together, the movie can't quite get past feeling like highlights from a mini-series. Crash is like something that played on HBO once, and they cut it into pieces and stitched them together into a movie. One wishes the story had more room to breathe. What would happen if we got to know more about characters like Fraser's D.A., or Bullock's harried wife-of-the-D.A., or Don Cheadle's police detective? Each character plays their role in the larger drama, but something is lost by the lack of elaboration. Vital material seems missing from Crash, which is why, for all its thematic gravity, its hum, it ends up feeling like an exercise in clever plot mechanics and not an organic piece of storytelling. It's not a morality play in the way a Dardenne Brothers film is; it doesn't achieve the sense of uplift that Rosetta does, or La Promesse. It doesn't have the rawness of a Ken Loach portrayal of small people crushed by forces beyond their control. It's a commercial morality play (even if it's technically an indie). It's plot-heavy, and we're a little overly aware of the stars (it's hard to look at Sandra Bullock and not think, ""Somebody's fishing for indie cred.""). None of this makes the movie bad; in fact, it's pretty good. But it's good in a certain limiting way, a way that doesn't allow tendrils of meaning to branch off from the central conceit, that doesn't encourage a real sense of complexity. It feels like a big-time movie, and has some real dramatic high-points, but it's a little bit of a smoke and mirrors job. There's something to Crash, just not as much as there could've been."

","""Crash"" is certainly the best recent American movie that I have seen for many years. The contemporary story of intolerance, racism, fear and redemption for some characters is disclosed along two days of this important American city through the lives of different ethnical and economical groups, which interacts with the others. The most important, the interface between their lives happens most of the times in an unexpected way.<br/><br/>When I see in IMDb that Paul Haggis wrote also ""Million Dollar Baby"", I include him as one of the best contemporary American writers. In my point of view, it is very difficult to successfully develop several characters along 113 minutes running time through several stories and in a very sensitive way as he did. I felt touched by the story of the Iraquian immigrant that buys a gun to protect his shop and the Latin locksmith that tells a fairytale to his daughter. I confess that I cried when the girl used her invisible mantle to protect her father, and that I jumped over the couch when I saw that the guy actually shot blankets instead of bullets. I can not judge the life of people that lives in Los Angeles, and I do not know whether this movie represents a sample of American society, but honestly it seems to be scary for minorities to live in USA in the present days of intolerance. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Crash  No Limite"" (""Crash  In the Limit"")"

","OK, so I registered with IMDb just to voice my opinion. I regularly use IMDb to decide what movies to see and have never seen ratings this high for such a transparent and contrived movie.<br/><br/>The world portrayed in the film is *NOT* the world that I live in. That is not to say that I am ignorant of the discrimination that exists, it's just that I don't live in fear of being held at gunpoint, robbed, molested, or having the keys to my locks sold. I don't think being rich, being poor, or having a tattoo says anything about an individual except that they have money, don't have money, or have permanent ink on their arm. So I found this movie annoying because it tries to open your eyes to the racist world we live in. I don't live in this world, I'm sorry if you do and I'm even more sorry if you found this movie particularly profound or insightful.<br/><br/>I gave the movie a 6 for good acting and unique cinematography."

The acting in this film hits the spot, with no one member of the cast (including Tony Danza) letting the show down, instead it only helps reinforce the points being made. These points are very hard hitting and so this film should be be rented if you are looking for a good time or a laugh, instead it should be taken to heart. This is a film that should not only be seen by the public, but should be on the receiving end of many an Oscar, Best Picture, Best (supporting)actor/actress, Best Direction, all should be claimed by this film. It leaves the winners over the past 5 years standing, but i fear that this will not be the case, as the topics targeted within this film might be to challenging to win these awards.

"cherryatfsu","Null","6","12","11 December 2006"," Why Crash won Academy Award over Brokeback Mountain
","Brokeback Mountain vs. Crash<br/><br/>In my opinion Crash won the Academy Award instead of Brokeback Mountain because it encompassed social issues that people of different races, ages, and social classes can relate to. As opposed to Brokeback Mountain, the film Crash was able to reach the audience and attain a sense of empathy. The film also allows the viewer to sympathize and connect with the characters, because there are a multitude of social issues to consider under the circumstances the film portrays. Brokeback Mountain strictly focuses on the difficulties that a homosexual couple faces during the early 60's. The time-frame covered in Brokeback Mountain itself poses as a roadblock inhibiting the audience from deeply relating to the film's content because it takes place in a distant setting. This is amplified by the fact that most of its questionable behavior(s) occurs in the mountains away from the general population. Since the early 60's, many American's frame of mind have changed and homosexual advocacy movements have made notable progress. These advances in civil rights for the homosexual community make some of the circumstances portrayed in the film irrelevant to present day and age. Crash displays a more accurate picture of present American society. Crash, successfully makes its main points: racism, prejudices, and stereotypes are still alive in the United States and affect millions daily. More importantly Crash allows the viewer to understand why these behaviors are problematic and especially conflictive for people in minority groups. Crash is a powerful film because you are able to observe the flaws, shortcomings, and weaknesses in the characters; this helps make them more realistic and humanistic. Throughout different scenes in the movie some of the characters are able to validate themselves and correct the error of their ways. This is refreshing because you are comforted by positive features of human nature. At the same time, it is eye opening because it is truthful, sincerely depicted, and believable. Because the conflict in Brokeback Mountain was centered around the hardships that the protagonists face as homosexual men, it is alienating to viewers who cannot relate or do not wish to understand the dramatic psychological, social, and emotional effects resulting from the stigma associated with homosexuality. The fact that the two characters personified rugged, ""gay"", cowboys, I found to be cliché and this made it incredibly hard to relate and understand these characters personally. To make my point I watched the film with a young heterosexual African American male; his reaction to the movie was that of repulse and un-acceptance to the film content and delivery. Like my movie-buddy, many viewers may have found themselves shutting out and away from the message that the film may have tried to deliver because it cannot be universally applied to all groups and their morals/belief systems. With no need for elaborate detail, Crash offered an accurate portrayal of present American society and applicable social issues. On any given day you can watch the news and hear about police brutality or incidents of blatant discriminatory acts and behaviors. One extraordinary example of how Crash accurately reflects American culture is through its use and depiction of Mid-Eastern characters. This is pertinent to current events because this minority group has become extremely susceptible to prejudice and discrimination in the aftermath of 9-11. I did not feel as if Brokeback Mountain was reflective of or applicable to a general population because it dealt only with homosexuality. Also, as noted earlier the plot takes place over four decades ago, making the viewer unable to relate unless they personally lived through that era. After watching both films and reading Annie Proulx's Blood on the red carpet I felt that the 78th Academy Award went to the better movie. I do not think that Brokeback Mountain's loss is attributed to people feeling uneasy about graphic illustrations of homosexual relationships and sex (although that may be a possibility nonetheless). Instead, I think that Crash was picked because it reached a broader audience and raised awareness towards racial and ethnic inequality; which is more commonly experienced and suffered throughout racial and ethnic lines. By exposing common stereotypes and prejudices it conveys the message that mass scale changes are necessary for the progress of our country and all its diverse groups of people."

","This is a terrible film. For shock value, it didn't work. For any racial message, it's been done before and in a better way. For plot, it was confusing and often lengthy and boring. I cannot believe that this film was voted over BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, which was so much more of a statement. And that Hoffman was Best Actor over Heath Ledger's underplayed beautiful performance. Makes you doubt the Academy thinking process and you wonder if the entire awards thing is a put up job.<br/><br/>Back to this sordid and much too long film. Paul Haggis is at the helm with writing, producing and directing this piece. I read all the other comments and it's scary to think they love this film. It's also great to see there are others that weren't bulldozed with it like myself. You can put all the talent you have into a film and that doesn't make it a hit. Sandra Bullock going around being angry, Don Cheadle (an actor I don't get) walking around with one look on his face ""Duh"", Matt Dillon maybe the best performance of the lot, Terrence Howard another overrated actor, Ryan Phillippe, not too bad in this as the rookie cop, Thandie Newton, who was excellent (scene with her and Dillon best in film) and Shaun Toub going around being miserable. There are others I won't go into. Believe me, they were not that imposing in their performances.<br/><br/>I shall always remember this picture not for it's value as a film but as the film that beat out BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and shouldn't have. But, you know, history will tell. Like CITIZEN KANE, which was thumbed down all those years ago, now remains one of the finest. Who remembers HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY? The same will happen with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. CRASH will disappear and the Academy Awards will go down as a big fiasco."
"kkipple","5","6","12","3 April 2006"," Not horrible, but quite shallow.
","Caught this movie the other night, as I was curious to see what Hollywood deems ""Best Picture"" material these days.<br/><br/>Crash is an uneven film. It was mildly engaging, well shot and had an enjoyable musical score. The constant cutting between various characters in dramatic situations kept the film moving along at a brisk pace, and the acting was above average. However, the message Crash tries to convey seems to amount to:<br/><br/>1. The City of LA is filled with racists. 2. Racism is bad. 3. Are you sure you're not racist? Even a little bit?<br/><br/>The dialog was borderline absurd; there was virtually no one in the film who was able to interact with another person without the topic of race immediately entering the situation. In the Crash universe, a typical elevator conversation would play out thusly:<br/><br/>A professionally dressed white man and a black youth with baggy jeans and bling enter an elevator.<br/><br/>Racist white man: ""Hello young black man. I notice you are black. Would you happen to be carrying a handgun?""<br/><br/>Thuggish-looking black man: ""Mr. White man, I am offended! Just because I dress like the gangsters you see on MTV does not qualify me as a gang-banger! You're just perpetuating a damaging stereotype about young black men in America today! You should be ashamed of yourself. But to answer your question, yeah, I'm packing.""<br/><br/>The women in the film are shrill, demanding and hysterical, the men are degraded, bitter and fit their stereotypes a far too well. Oh, and everyone is racist.<br/><br/>I just can't see this as being Best Picture material, but then again, neither could I with ""Chicago"". I suppose in today's culture, any film that broaches the subject of racism, however ham-fistedly, must be considered edgy and bold.<br/><br/>I didn't rate Crash a total disaster, but if I wanted an enlightening look on race in America today, I'd watch Chappelle's Show. So should you."
"mykedee","5","6","12","15 March 2006"," Vingettes weaved together with a common thread of racism and bigotry, but BAD CASTING!!!!!!!
","Nowhere near a best picture in my eyes. The casting is very questionable here. Terrence Howard as a director, hmmm; Cheadle as a love interest of a tall cute Latina detective, hmmmm; Brandon Fraser as a DA, kinda young looking, LOL that was hilarious. Phillippe as a Cop even funnier ---Come on! Even Dillon, who was good, didn't have that look of a tired 17yr veteran of the force. Finally, the annoying Ludicrous (JAR JAR BINKS comes to mind) talking and talking, rattling off phrases and sentences as if he was recalling his lines each and every scene.<br/><br/>Some funny moments of reality. A few real moments when Sandra Bullock and Fraser are changing their locks at home and begin to argue about more racial stereotyping. But for the most part unbelievable story, and bad casting. Who was good? Dillon was decent. Bulluck was very good at playing a bigot with a mouth on her, but not a stretch. Cheadle is always good, but even here I think he played the part short and a bit too safe. He seemed unsure of where it was going, but that was probably because he needed to because of the ending. He is also way to nice of an actor to be bogged down by Esposito, scene after scene.<br/><br/>The dialogue is very questionable with the black youths. I am black, never hopped a ride, not a criminal, but have been around that crowd. Umm, LOL, Luddy and Tate were rated G, as in Goofy compared to real Jackers. Even with a bit of education, a person who is ready to jack a ride, do they speak the words Ludicrous rants off? I will say no way! Real Jackers are hyped and focused on the crime not the racial stereotypes of society. These two guys were a bit too casual to jack cars. Also, black youths in general don't talk the way they were talking when together, and there are no whites around. Even educated young black men don't speak that way when there are only black people around, for the most part. Tate and Luddy were speaking as if white people were listening. And none were. Also, Howard when he gets jacked and hides the carjacker from the cops, so he can teach him a lesson, as well as show some black pride; that scene was totally not believable. And then Phillippe's reaction with the police was not believable.<br/><br/>So after a while when you are watching scene after scene of unreal dialogue, the movie basically becomes unaccessible and not believable. By the time the little girl was shot, I was already convinced the movie was trying to be too stylish with very little substance-- other than the prevailing message being forced upon us, I could not relate to the Hispanic mans pain and anguish. So it was mildly entertaining and there are some moments of reality.<br/><br/>The best thing about CRASH is the movies final song at the end credits. Much better song than ""Its Hard Out Here for A Pimp."""

"bilahn","5","6","12","8 March 2006"," Pedantic and overdrawn - not worthy of Best Picture
","I will admit right off to my bias. I loved Brokeback, and have seen it several times. I am gay and wanted it to win. I would rather see a so-so movie about something I am interested in than an outstanding movie about something I am not. And I think most people (movie critics included, except Roger Ebert who has the unique ability to move outside his own biases, even if I frequently disagree with his conclusions) are pretty much the same way. I have sat thru some pretty mediocre movies just because there was a gay romance in it. But Brokeback Mountain is one of the very best gay subject movies I have ever seen, despite some notable flaws. <br/><br/>With that said, I tired as hard as possible to be objective about Crash. But I found it to be heavy handed, contrived, and drawn in broad stereotypical strokes. It played like one of the better TV dramas. Actually, it seemed more like a diversity training film than a real movie: ""In this section we see how Asians are often perceived as...."" or ""This is what African Americans have to deal with when confronted by city police..."" We have heard it all before, it is not entertaining or fresh. I felt like i was being bludgeoned with the admonishment ""Racism! It's racism! Everything was so obvious and laden with artifice. It just didn't ring true or engaging for me at all. Just about every single line and plot point in this movie is racially motivated. Do these characters do anything else? After about a half hour of this I wanted to scream ""Make it Stop!"" Certainly the issues raised in Crash are extremely important, but this movie is just overdone and without finesse.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there is fine acting and some interesting characters, and the movie is well put together, although nothing struck me as being terribly out of the ordinary. <br/><br/>Bottom line: Crash was boring!<br/><br/>I can only conclude that the Academy was either homophobic, was suffering from Brokeback fatigue, wanted to reward a home town movie, or maybe resented being dictated to about who the winner should be. Also Oscar often parcels out the major awards to several of the leading most deserving movies. That certainly happened this year. <br/><br/>Most likely reason: the heavy marketing strategy of the producers of Crash. It may not have occurred to everyone that not every Academy member sees every movie. It is almost like a political campaign. And i do think some of the more conservative members refused to see Brokeback Mountain. In the end, these awards don't mean a whole lot. <br/><br/>I am not one to play the ""we were robbed"" card, but when a movie has swept thru so many previous awards, and got such an overwhelming critical response (more than Crash), wins 3 Oscars, and then loses Best Picture, you have to wonder why.<br/><br/>There may arguably be a few ""better"" movies than Brokeback Mountain this year, but it should not have lost to Crash."

","I had a strange feeling after the Crash. While everything seemed to be in place, the whole thing didn't deliver to it's promise. It took me days to realize what was wrong.<br/><br/>Most of reviews adore performance by leading actors. Doubt it. Bullock? A few scenes to play a stereotypical heroine. Fraser? Nothing at all. Not their fault. Being so crowded with people, the script left almost no space to act for the most of the cast. The best performance actually comes from those who obtained the air in the script (TV director, his wife, corner shop owner).<br/><br/>The essence of the movie is too simplistic. Good people could turn bad, bad people could still be good. Now try to tell the essence of Magnolia in brief, it will take much more lines and time.<br/><br/>The mentioned conversions in Crash took place in pretty binary manner. Bad cop converts almost at once, which is looking to be not justified properly. Yes, there are reasons behind, but they are too difficult to figure out given with plethora of heroes and stories. Again the movie would have really benefited if the script was less packed. Compare with 21 grams.<br/><br/>The most impressing scene with the child and the gun worked fine (I cried) but this move is not a revelation. Check Shyamalan's Unbreakable, where the same scene delivers to the top thanks to the slow and accurate developing towards it.<br/><br/>Anti-racist face-slapping, personal drama, problem of authority possession, family drama  Haggis packed too many themes in one script. The only thing it probably misses for real is a drop of self-irony. That pre-final scene with the storm of ash heavily reminds of the frog rain from Magnolia, which was that only and necessary drop. Crash is taking itself far more serious, which is not making it wittier.<br/><br/>Too many loose ends. If they followed that 2-minute discussion about Iraqi fireman nomination it wouldn't look so artificial. Did they finally change the locks in attorney house after that 4-minute rumble? Why showing in detail all that facial expressions by his unnecessary black female assistant? If Cambodians in LA was an effort to borrow some ironic finale from Magnolia it didn't work as well.<br/><br/>OK, enough grumbling. Actually I gave 7 stars to Crash, which means I rather liked it.<br/><br/>What's really captivating in Crash is that it deals with sensitive racial issues in sincere and straightforward manner. What others would hide in politically correct wordings Haggis takes naturalistic. For the first 20 minutes (before style flickering starts) Haggis even takes over Manderlay by Von Trier. Some parts are really great piece of screen writing and directing  I'm still under impression of that silent scene with parallel inner conversation by TV director and the shop owner. Episode with body search was really strong and precise. The less worked better again, which unfortunately applies not to the whole movie."

The theme of the film is great: showing modern metropolitan life in present situation, filled with frustration and prejudice against anything that is different, unknown or mostly: foreign. But it is done in such a blatant way, that it irritates me more than that it grabs me. Every character being introduced shouts out something racist at least before their third sentence is finished, so we all know how their character is and that most likely, at the end of the film this will change. And of course, the one being shout at, turns out to be a perfect citizen, while the presumed perfect citizens turn out to have their dark sides as well..... This continues throughout the whole film and every situation: you can really predict (almost) every situation and development, which was very disappointing and annoying as well. In some cases (e.g. without spoiling it: Sandra Bullock and the maid..) you see it coming miles ahead and at first expect something different to happen, cause otherwise it would be too easy, but damn, the most obvious happens!

A freak storm brings all the characters together as does the playing of a single song, both ideas taken from Magnolia. Even the very idea of people crashing into one another to ""feel"" or ""Connect"" was used in a better film with the same title by Cronenberg. I truly do not understand how any intelligent person could not see how one note the performances were and how transparent and elementary the story. Look at Do the Right Thing for a more accurate portrayal of how embedded and covert racism actually is. A true disappointment."

","When ""Brokeback Mountain"" didn't win Best Picture, I sarcastically told a friend the voters would be accused of homophobia.

I won't waste my time commenting on Proulx's idiotic rant, but she was right about ""Crash"", which I finally got to see last night.<br/><br/>The racist cop saves the black woman he assaulted?! The Persian shop keeper shoots point-blank at the Latino locksmith but misses because the locksmith's daughter is his angel?! The shop keeper just happens to be the father of the coroner who has to break the news to the black cop about his punk brother who got offed by the racist cop's partner, who kept the husband of the woman the racist cop assaulted from getting blown away by his trigger-happy cohorts?! The white trophy wife learns her ""best friend"" is the Latina maid she hates?!

"schapers1455","1","7","15","19 March 2006"," Good but not great
","Crash was a good movie that struck a nerve not only with people that live in Los Angeles, but with people I know from the military as well. The movie was a lot like ""Traffic"" in how it took a controversial subject, car jacking and violence, and spread it along 4 or 5 different stories that directly and indirectly intertwine with each other. Each is done well and then the movie abruptly ends after 1 hour and 50 minutes. This left me feeling a little shortchanged because none of the stories lead anywhere. One hour and fifty minutes just isn't long enough to properly develop 5 different stories. Heck it sometimes isn't enough for one. ""Traffic"" is a similar movie (about drugs and violence instead of carjacking) but is superior because its 2 1/2 hours long and properly develops the stories. I'd normally give ""Crash"" about a 7 but I'm giving it a 1 while giving ""Traffic"" a 10 because I feel the ratings should be reversed (Crash has a 8.2 while Traffic has a 7.8). A good movie but one of worst best picture winners in recent memory."

","The first time I viewed the film, ""Crash"" was interesting and dynamic. The performances were strong, consistent, and compelling. However, after repeat viewings, ""Crash"" crashed. The script by Paul Haggis becomes tired and dull, with nothing more important to say than ""racism is bad"". What Haggis misses is that explicit racism is everywhere, and the fact that the movie needlessly spins a web of stories to tell this lesson is over dramatic and obnoxious. It's the covert and implicit racism that needs to be explored, discussed, and challenged. It's Tony Danza's character that is the most compelling in this regard. It is a shame that Haggis doesn't have the guts to really put the issues on the line to challenge viewers. Who knows ... he might have lost the Oscar and instead made a memorable film."

","""When inward life dries up, when feeling decreases and apathy increases, when one cannot affect or even genuinely touch another person, violence flares up as a demonic necessity for contact, a mad drive forcing touch in the most direct way possible. "" - by Rollo May, ""Love and Will"" <br/><br/>The deadliest weapon of all is not a gun, a knife, a bomb, or a poison. They just finish the job, which always starts with the words. We are very creative in choosing the right words that will hurt and infuriate the fellow human being and start the unstoppable nuclear reaction of hatred, intolerance, and violence. ""Crash"" is about such reactions that lead to the collision of races, backgrounds, characters, and cultures - all that big modern American city like L.A. is built of. The lives of Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians are smashed into one another quickly and painfully - in the course of one day that will change these lives forever.<br/><br/>The film is an impressive directorial debut by Paul Haggis; an Oscar nominated screenwriter of ""Million Dollar Baby"". ""Crash"", IMO is much better written than M$B. Acting is superb by all cast (Don Cheaddle, Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock in a small supporting role playing against her usual nice girl image and very good in it, Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillippe and Matt Dillon who is a revelation as an arrogant racist cop who would turn by his different side later on).<br/><br/>I was going to say that the film is not perfect and it depends a bit too much on coincidence - but life is a chain of coincidences, sometimes even more than we can imagine.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","I can't believe the hype over this film- it was such a clumsy exploration of race and racism, it was verging on pantomime. It isn't simply a case of film not matching the (now post-Oscar) hype, it just seemed not to even touch the true depths and subtleties of racism (the factors I personally find most disturbing) and instead boiled things down to a few sound-bites about, I dunno, Hispanic's parking, or white people being deprived of jobs.<br/><br/>In a way the hype over this film perhaps says a lot about how sad the state of the world is. If Sandra Bullock telling her maid that she's the only friend she has is taken as some kind profound and new statement about how ""race really shouldn't matter,"" what does it say about the people watching this thinking ""You know- I never thought about it like that?"" Scary thought huh?"

"pookey56","10","7","15","10 September 2005"," LA Confidential 2
","let's see; corrupt, racist cops, a protagonist who has no idea who he is; a great, ensemble cast; actors playing against type (mostly), the fact that things haven't changed much; Crash is very much like a better movie called LA Confidential, but without the complex story-line and subtlety of the latter. but, having said that, Crash is one of the best films i've ever seen. more than many other films, CRASH changed me in more than just theory but in a tangible way. it showed the good and not so good in all of us; how complex human beings are, how shiny happy people on the surface can be the most lonely and isolated amongst us. i found it to be a poignant, subtle, intricate montage filled with heart-breaking nuances and circumstances and yet held a positive view for our species. desperation, bigotry, anger, helplessness, personal power, luck, courage and cowardice were all there. Paul Haggis' film is a ""million dollar baby"" in a world filled with such complexity and contradiction, and CRASH let our compassion, kindness, and ability to change shine through despite the ugliness in our world, and demonstrated how compassion and beauty can escalate as quickly as violence. this movie is going straight in my collection of favorite films to watch. it was also nice to see how good Thandie Newton and Ryan Philippe can be as actors while solidifying the performance standards of Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle. and how refreshing to see Sandra Bullock play a B**ch! everyone was superb. the cast deserves awards for ensemble cast, and the score was memorable. the screen play was both understated and powerful, a perfect blend. we are imperfect beings, but we are remarkable. as is this film. after reading some of the anti-Canadian commentaries about this film, for you Canadian critics out there, particularly the one who claims we should stick to what we know (hockey); i cant be the only one who sees the irony of these anti-Canadian comments. Haggis being Canadian has nothing to do with this film. the irony made me laugh. they only serve to validate this film even more. Atom Egoyan, Anne Wheeler, Lorne Michaels, Sylvan Chauvet, James Cameron, Denys Arcand, Norman Jewison, David Cronenberg, Arthur Hiller, Claude Jutra, Louis b Mayer and Ivan Reitman, to name a few, have being Canadian in common. although i'm willing to bet most of them have laced up a few pairs of skates, the last time i checked, they weren't on any hockey teams. film as an art form, can be masterpieces. we live in a global community, where bigotry and stereotyped views exist all over the planet. but as Sam-Wise says, there's good in this world too. that's the message i received from this great film. i didn't see it as an indictment on ""americans"" by an outsider. for me it was a comment on the complexity of man, that we're not just labels, and that good and not-so-good exists in All of us, that we are a flawed species and need to continually re-evaluate ourselves. i'm sorry if you felt this was an attack on America. if you think that bigotry of all kinds doesn't exist in Canada, nor anywhere else for that matter, come on up and visit sometime. and don't forget your skates. an American icon named Clint Eastwood chose Haggis to write the screenplay for one of his growing list of consistently amazing films. his work as a director is nothing short of astonishing. that alone says a LOT about both of them. footnote*** i had a chance to ask Terrence Howard two questions:1) ""why do you think people are so divided about Crash?"" Terrence: ""i think it's because it forces people to look at questions about themselves that they haven't answered"" 2)""would you work with Paul Haggis again?"" Terrence:"" are you kidding? i'd mow the man's lawn"". Terrence, i'd watch any film you're in in a new york minute...<br/><br/>i've been doing some ""asking around"" after the best picture win at the Oscars. my preference was BBM, and strongly; but i wasn't surprised that Crash took home the big prize. people say, that Crash was ""too in your face"", too ""preachy"", and too ""obvious"". yeah, it was in your face; yeah, it was obvious. racism, and racial profiling is obvious. but we're not suppose to talk about it. we're expected to know it's all around us, so we don't need to hear about it nor think about it, nor see it. we have to be ""subtle"". Too damn bad that this film may compel you to confront these things. too damn bad it's so in your face...."
"toivomartikainen","10","7","15","11 September 2005"," The most powerful movie of 2005
","Paul Haggis' story of human destinies and cultures colliding in the present-day L.A. is without a doubt the best American drama this year. The way Haggis deals with the most flammable issue, racism, is to be highly respected. Haggis is able to show us that no person is entirely evil, but not completely good, either. The characters develop vastly throughout the movie, and we find out that none of them are really happy with their lives. What makes this movie so great is the intense screenplay. I had to watch this film twice to understand all the small things that eventually make a big difference. Truth be told, Crash would breath much more freely being 15-30 minutes longer, now the audience has too much to deal with in such a small period of time. Should Paul Haggis not receive the Oscar for best screenplay in next February's Academy Awards, I will be completely confused.<br/><br/>Ten out of ten."

","Watching Paul Haggis' CRASH brings to mind Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS, and Lawrence Kasdan's GRAND CANYON. Haggis manages to do them both one better.<br/><br/>With only a little contrivance, Haggis manages to convey the interconnectedness that Altman's film vainly tried to portray, and at the same time he manages to cut Kasdan's film to pieces as naive fantasy.<br/><br/>CRASH is a marvellously ironic, shades-of-gray masterpiece. Nobody gets through unscathed, and yet all are sympathetic to some degree. This is an unusually intelligent Hollywood movie, and definitely worth a watch."

Personally I thought the movie painted a perfect picture. Every scene in that movie played a part in our lives that are lived from day-to-day. <br/><br/>It wasn't only about race it was also about obstacles people are faced with. In some ways it shows that race can be a scapegoat for dealing with the obstacles in ones life. <br/><br/>I've read a number of user comments and they are all different. One person didn't understand the Bullock stair scene or another didn't understand the hitchhiking scene and so on but the only real way someone could understand it is if they do there best to be in the same position. Not as them self though but as the person in the movie. Yes maybe during the hitchhiking scene you may have made a best friend or you may have done things differently but the person in the movie didn't and that is who's being displayed. Try and understand the characters for who they are not for how a movie should display them.<br/><br/>In today's world there are still race battles occurring all over the USA but Crash is a great example of where we are today. Of course it's not going to show all angles because who would want to go see at movie that never ends. I almost guarantee that you will find something in the movie you can relate to. <br/><br/>Great movie!"

"Pedro_Duarte","1","8","18","11 March 2006"," The most overrated film I've seen this year
","Crash is the biggest cliché in movie history to win the Academy Award for the Best Feature Film. Paul Haggis wanted to give a moral lesson about racism so he made a movie which is simply a collection of situations with no plot, inside which are characters acting in a racist way. From the first to the last minute of this movie, the only thing you see is RACISM. It's like there's not even one last not-racist person alive in the U.S.! It seems like the world is lost and everyone hates the guy next to him, who is, in this movie, in the most idiotic way, always a person of a different race! Crash almost hasn't got a single scene with two characters from the same race! Always a black and a Latin, or a white and a black. It's ridiculous and exaggerated. Crash is so moralist! And worst, it calls RACIST (with capital letters because they exaggerate everything) to every person in the audience. Well, I'm an anti-racism activist and what I have to say is that nobody goes to the movies to get moral lesson and to be insulted. Specially by a film - and this is the biggest problem of Crash - which is, itself, a racist picture! The film's characters are horrible cliché caricatures of every race in the world - the white racist cop, the black honorable cop, the black robber, the Latin with tattoos, the Asian guy who practices traffic of Asian woman and children, the Arab shop owner. In Crash, suddenly, all these characters become stupid and start doing ridiculous things just because Paul Haggis needed some simple conflict for which he could, later, find a resolution. By some miracle they all know each other and they all have problems between them. The plot is so obvious! You can find out everything that's going to happen one hour before it happens. When it happens you only feel like laughing, which is not the picture's intent. It's ridiculous to compare this film with Magnolia by Paul Thomas Anderson. Both have lots of characters who have connections between them. But in Magnolia, every character has a very specific job or role in the other person's life that generates the link between them all. In Crash, we have common people that by the most weird as hell coincidences (that is to say: by no reason) deal with each other. Once again we want to stop watching the film when we realize how grotesque and unreal the plot and screenplay are. To say more about the screenplay: the dialogs are absurd! Specially those between the two black young robbers. Nobody talks like that. Something like: ""Don't catch a bus man! Are you crazy? Buses have big windows so that people can humiliate the black people that have no other option but to travel in them""???? WHAT? Another problem of this screenplay is the resolution of the conflicts that happen by no motif. Sandra Bullock stops being racist because she falls of the stairs??? One word about the directing. What is the deal with Slow Motion? Slow motion when Terrence Howard is trowing pieces of junk to a car set on fire? Why? About the sound. That song is horrible. It fits the movie by being such a huge musical cliché! Besides that, the melody has nothing to do with the rest. I couldn't believe when I heard ""Crash"" was the winner of 2006 for Best Feature, Best Screeplay and Best Editing. I hated this movie. From the screenplay to the actors, including the directing and the music. My conclusion is people are compelled to say they liked the film because it deals with racism and everyone likes to think of himself as an anti-racist person."
"gazettewriter","10","8","18","8 March 2006"," Well Deserving Of Oscar
","An outstanding film that grips you from the start, Crash is a riveting story that addresses the polarizing issues of race and separation in modern America. With a wonderful cast, Crash is rich in texture and emotion and adeptly drives home the message of how pervasive racism and prejudice is in America, permeating each of our diverse cultures. Truly a must see film, Crash provides insight into a difficult situation without offering up any cliché commentary, which I believe makes the film all the more potent. Far too often film-makers find themselves compelled to proffer a solution to a political problem when that in fact is often better left for the viewer to pontificate after watching the film. Crash deserves every bit of it's Oscar for Best Picture."

"howard.schumann","9","10","24","5 December 2005"," A thread of common humanity
","There is a process in a consciousness training I took many years ago in which people pretend that they are scared to death of the person sitting beside them. When they discover that that person is scared to death of them, the only thing to do is laugh. Urban society breeds fear, intolerance and lack of trust, especially of strangers of different ethnic backgrounds whom we see as potential threats rather than as people with problems similar to our own. In Crash, Paul Haggis has the vision to see the thread of common humanity that connects us beyond the socially conditioned fear. He has assembled an outstanding ensemble cast that includes Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe and all are first rate.<br/><br/>The film is divided into several episodes and, as it unfolds, seemingly unrelated threads intersect to form a connection. In the opening segment, as a young black man brazenly complains that white people automatically assume that all blacks are criminals, he and his partner incongruously hijack the SUV of a District Attorney Peter (Brendan Fraser) and his young wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). The carjacking by the two African Americans (Ludacris, Larenz Tate) leaves Jean in a racist outrage, demeaning her housekeeper Maria (Yomi Perry) and venting her anger on a locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena), a Mexican-American working in the house. Typical of many, she tells a friend on the phone, ""I'm angry all the time and I don't know why."" In one of the film's most touching episodes, Daniel returns home to provide his frightened young daughter with an invisible vest to protect her from harm. When Daniel tells an Iranian shopkeeper Farhad (Shaun Taub) that his door needs replacing, the shopkeeper becomes visibly upset and directs his anger toward Daniel who is only trying to provide security. When his store is vandalized, he buys a gun and threatens Daniel and his little girl in a heart-pounding scene that leads to a true epiphany. In another thread, TV director Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) are pulled over by a racist cop Ryan (Matt Dillon) who suspects some wrongdoing. His sexual touching of Cameron's wife, however, is humiliating for Christine and she becomes furious with her husband for standing by and letting it happen, irrationally ignoring the potential danger if he resisted.<br/><br/>Taken aback by the ugly incident is Ryan's partner Hansen (Ryan Phillipe) who requests reassignment but soon has to confront his own demons when he gives a ride to a black hitchhiker. Meanwhile, a different side of Ryan is shown as he lovingly takes care of his sick father and rescues a black woman from certain death in a car accident. The final thread has Graham (Don Cheadle), a police detective, dealing with his estranged relationship with his wife Ria (Jennifer Esposito) and his mother who is a drug addict. Though the film is gritty and confrontational, the soothing music by Kathleen ""Bird"" York alleviates some of the shock and nastiness and reminds us that there is a divine melody always playing in the background of our lives. Though flawed by some contrived coincidences, Haggis has given us a crash course in confronting stereotypes and looking beyond outward appearances to see the humanity that people are capable of."

","I was in awe almost from the moment the movie began. When I saw the list of actors that would be in it, I was just a little unsure of how it would turn out. We all know the game, the bigger the actor, the worse off it is. Well, I must say that was totally the opposite for this movie.<br/><br/>All of the actors were brilliant, and in my honest opinion gave the best performances of their careers, except for Clarence Howard due to the fact that I can't decide which he was better in (this or Hustle and Flow).<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock surprised me probably the most due to the fact that all you ever see her in is comedies, and in this, totally different story. She was your upper-class, all-American white snob, and she perfected it. Her last scene in it was priceless and truly touching and bitterly honest.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon was horrifically magnificent as the racist cop who finally gets the big turn-a-round in the scene involving the actual car crash. The moment between him and Thandie Newton almost moved me to tears. Both gave excellent performances.<br/><br/>But the scene that literally seemed to stop my heart was when the older Persian man shot at the young Latino and his daughter jumps in the way. That was probably the most powerful scene in the whole film, and it was just...more than words can describe.<br/><br/>Ludarcis and Ryan Phillipe both gave stellar performances and the latter was just absolute in one of the film-ending twists. Simply amazing. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone, for it is a great learning tool, and an honest look into how society truly performs today. I definitely think this movie will give you a different outlook on life, if not change it.<br/><br/>Ten stars, and kudos to Paul Haggis for another wonderful creation."

","............................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>After seeing CRASH for the first time, in September, 2005, I said "" WOW!...Why haven't I found out about this movie before?"" (Well, maybe it's because it was released in the U.S. just a week before going to Colombia on vacation, on May 14, 2005.) This is the kind of film that you often dream about seeing, but are really lucky if just one of its caliber is released in a year! <br/><br/>Scenes from the Movie seem to have kept swirling around in my brain for weeks! Below, I'm going to explain why: CRASH impacts not so much for its action as, perhaps, its title might imply, nor fantastic scenes utilizing dazzling ""CGI"" effects, but by the undeniable quality and human warmth of the story it tells. <br/><br/>Time and again, CRASH shows us people, whom, at first, seem so easy to decipher, so black and white, and then, in a matter of seconds, disorients us with a chilling dose of unadulterated, hard reality: People are not at all one-dimensional, like in the comics. We are flesh and blood, replete with clandestine simmering passions, occult emotional scars, irrational internal conflict, and oftentimes victims of relentless, implacable, merciless fate! In stark contrast to its title, CRASH impacts for the subtlety that it displays from beginning to end. Boasting a truly majestic cast, CRASH is directed, orchestrated and integrated with inspiration by Paul Haggis, who also demonstrates here his creative genius in the capacity of writer, producer and composer. There is absolutely none of the ""formula"", which so infects almost all Hollywood films, in this independent Lions Gate Films production.<br/><br/>CRASH takes place in my hometown of Los Angeles, which serves, in this case, as a microcosm representative of the entire United States. (Which is really not all that far removed from reality.) That there have been films in the past that have focused on racism or racial prejudice is undeniable. The vast majority of these pontificate on racism as the worst of evils, in a repetitive manner, without any real in-depth perspective. In addition, they almost always focus on one particular ethnic group. (Prejudice against blacks, Jews, Mexicans, etc.) More often than not, in these films the oppressed are all saints and the oppressors are all demons! There is a certain disconnect with reality. In contrast, there is multiracial interaction in CRASH. Whites with blacks, blacks with Asians, Orientals with Latinos, Asians with whites, Arabs with whites, blacks with Latinos, etc.<br/><br/>In its notes about the production, IMDb lists a figure of just 6.5 million as the total cost of production. Absolutely amazing, considering that within the cast there are several actors who probably typically charge 5 to 10 million to perform in just one movie! Sandra Bullock (GRAVITY), Don Cheadle (Ocean 's Twelve, Hotel Rwanda), Matt Dillon (Something About Mary), Brendan Fraser (The Mummy, George of the Jungle) and Ryan Philippe (Cruel Intentions), all in roles that are in stark contrast to the type of role that made them famous, and each portrays a resonating, multi-faceted character who is very credible. CRASH makes it easy to identify with many of its characters, regardless of race, ethnicity or country of origin.<br/><br/>There are no sex scenes or graphic violence in CRASH, but as there are many issues that are aimed at adults, consequently, it doesn't seem that CRASH would be of much interest to those under 12 years of age. Of over 100,000 movies on IMDb, CRASH is ranked at Number 334 and rated a 7.9!<br/><br/>...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!"

","This film has been entirely overrated. Viewing it with high hopes will certainly disappoint.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, and although the performances are quite good, the story itself is so riddled with preposterous racism and negativity, the movie as a whole becomes forced, frustrating, and highly predictable.<br/><br/>Character development is polarized, making each sequence more predictable than the next. Dramatic scenes become almost ridiculous as these polarized characters are forced to clash. Everything to the extreme; in Crash there is no middle ground. While the film intends to shock the audience with the reality of racism and prejudice, it forgets that life itself, be it in LA or Kansas City, is not so divided, and not so grim. Yes, we all live in our separate worlds, with our own history, and our own lives, but we certainly do not throw down the gauntlet when confronted with differences. A world like this would be chaos, and contrary to popular belief we do not live in a world of chaos.<br/><br/>Other outstanding reviews beg the question, do people really think this is the way life is?

","""Crash"" is one of those movies which, for some reason I can't really figure out, is considered by both critics/audiences a masterpiece. It got 3 Academy Awards: Best Picture (the one which should have gone to ""Brokeback Mountain""), Best Editing (Claire Simpson did a much better job in ""The Constant Gardener"") and Best Original Screenplay (well, any other film deserved it more, I guess), among many other prestigious awards.<br/><br/>This is not a bad movie. It has some good moments and a few strong performances (Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton - all the rest of the cast is just okay; Don Roos' ""Happy Endings"" has a much better ensemble, if you ask me). The idea of a film concerning the hatred policy that rules in LA is compelling itself - but Paul Haggis (who wrote ""Million Dollar Baby"") and Bobby Moresco's script is so schematic that ""Crash"" became just a shadow of a great film. The ""In the Deep"" moment shamelessly ripped ""Magnolia""s 'Wise Up' off (the comparison is inevitable). ""Magnolia"", by far the best film of 1999 and possibly the best ensemble drama ever, wasn't even nominated to Best Picture Oscar; but, at least, they awarded another great, daring film (""American Beauty""). Since in 2005 the strongest film was a ""gay cowboy love story"", the Academy puritans were courageous enough to award...""Crash"", which is more like a slightly above the average TV-movie. My vote: 5.5 out of 10."
"jansen-aui","6","5","10","15 June 2006"," It works; but in such a manipulative manner that I couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted
","The directorial debut of Oscar nominated Million Dollar Baby screenwriter Paul Haggis, Crash takes a close-up look at the lives of a dozen or so Los Angeles citizens over one 36- hour span, and how, when ""pushed to the limit"", each of these characters will reveal their suppressed prejudice and racism. It is a picture that would really love to be important. It would really love to preach the good word about racism and tolerance in contemporary times, but sadly, it ultimately fails. In an attempt to assert the importance of Crash's message to the masses, Haggis here has taken himself too seriously and the result is quite the opposite: it's a little laughable.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel like I was being beaten over the head with the film's message every ten minutes; such is the unnatural, repetitive nature of Haggis screenplay. There is a scene mid-way through the film where two policemen are discussing a crime which may have been racially motivated, and the white policeman spurts, ""f**kin' black people, huh?"" which almost makes one throw his hands in the air and give up. It's abrupt, ridiculous, and absolutely not the way anybody would naturally react in such a situation. In another instance, a white woman (Sandra Bullock) begins shouting racial slurs about the untrustworthiness of the Latino locksmith (Michael Pena) who's doing her a service, but - here's the kicker - she chooses to do so in the immediate vicinity of the Latino locksmith. Crash is littered with these contrived moments, seemingly written to force characters into situations of racial tension to remind the audience that the film is, in fact, about racism and tolerance (as if by some god-forsaken chance we'd forget!).<br/><br/>Crash is not without it's positives, however. The majority of the ensemble cast do their earnest best with an average script, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges (whose every second word is something ludicrous about black people being mistreated by white people) aside. Matt Dillon gives probably the film's best performance, capturing the struggle and frustration of his situation with believability and conviction, and opposite him, Thandie Newton was superb.<br/><br/>In addition to the good performances, Crash's second act does have two quite powerful sequences: the first involving a collision, both literal and metaphorical, between Dillon's and Newton's characters and the second involving the 5-year old daughter of the Latino locksmith who apparently has devastated a Persian store owner. Not surprisingly, these two situations are some of the more removed from Haggis' subject matter of race in Crash, dealing instead with issues like sexual harassment and a parent's inherent desire to protect their children. Of Million Dollar Baby's calibre this is not, but while I don't doubt Haggis' good intentions for this film, I do indeed doubt his execution."
"Rathko","4","5","10","15 May 2006"," Curiously Over-Hyped Melodrama
","There are some movies that are 'actor's movies'. They feature characters racked with such anger/guilt/resentment/self-loathing that every sentence of dialogue allows the actor to have a field day with every trick they ever learnt in The Actor's Studio. Filled with such impassioned emoting, these movies convey an initial impression of depth and powerful emotion. It's only on reflection that the viewer realizes that behind the tear-jerking, over-dramatic theatrics are characters and a storyline with all the depth of a birdbath after a spring rain. 'Crash' is one such movie.<br/><br/>The performances are universally outstanding, but the quality of acting is wasted on such poorly developed characters. The denizens of 'Crash' are, with few exceptions, preposterous caricatures, wearing their exaggerated prejudices on their sleeves and fueled by borderline-sociopath bouts of irrational anger. None are particularly likable or sympathetic. These cliché characters wander through a story propelled by increasingly contrived and unbelievable coincidence. After you've predicted the third plot 'twist' fifteen minutes before it arrives, the whole thing becomes quite dull and tedious.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis was a successful TV writer for 20 years; the mind that brought us 'Walker: Texas Ranger' and 'Due South'. Then, with 'Million Dollar Baby', he entered the Oscar-winning Big Time, as if from nowhere. But for all his awards and success, there is little evidence of a talent that goes much beyond the tear-jerking emotionally-manipulation he honed during re-writes of 'Thirtysomething' back in the eighties. This stuff may be thought-provoking to the average High School student, but as a grown adult, it resembles little more than a 21st century version of the domestic melodramas of the 1950's."
"animalmother05","3","5","10","27 March 2006"," It probably meant well
","Perhaps I went in with expectations that were too high, because I liked ""Million Dollar Baby,"" and everybody I spoke to who had seen this movie was in love with it. It is nowhere near as important or complex as it thinks it is, however, and functions as a bizarre kind of escapism. The film flaunts that it is about racism, that it reveals to us that people who don't consider themselves racist contribute to the problem to such an extent that the only people who might be stupid enough not to understand are the characters in the film. The narrative structure (which resembles ""Short Cuts"" or ""Magnolia"" or whichever of those you like) does not add much to the film; I suspect Haggis wanted to illustrate that these seemingly separate problems were systemic, but the screenplay is too calculated to succeed at this, and, by separating screen time between so many characters, they become oversimplified (with the possible exception of Don Cheadle's character, who is at times as simplistic as the other characters, but at times more real). Many seem more like one-dimensional characters with multiple personality disorder than fully developed human beings.<br/><br/>The most irritating thing about ""Crash"" is that its ideas in and of themselves are valid, but Haggis is incapable of using them effectively. It is sadly realistic that a white police officer (or anyone with a gun, for that matter) who does not consider himself racist could shoot an unarmed black man, making the assumption that the black man is armed and dangerous with little evidence other than racial profiling. What is not realistic, however, is that a police officer would pick up a hitchhiker (and if he were a racial profiler, certainly not a black man in a poor neighborhood), and Ryan Phillipe's screen transition is not convincing. It further calculates in a painfully symbolic scene, made even more painful by its use of slow-motion, in which a little girl is believed to be killed, and the sacrifice saves everyone.<br/><br/>What was Haggis thinking with the slow-motion scenes? With the exception of Wong Kar- Wai's ""In the Mood for Love,"" slow-motion should never be used under any circumstances whatsoever. It is almost a signed confession of the calculation of the screenplay.<br/><br/>I think it says something for the significance of this film that discussions around ""Crash"" are debates over the believability of the screenplay, and not in terms of its subject matter, but its dealing with it. I have yet to hear one intelligent debate about modern racism in the United States that this film has inspired."

","This movie has polarised opinion from those who believe it to be a masterful and seminal depiction of petty racism in today's America, and those who believe it is stereotypical, badly scripted nonsense. Really, it cannot be said to be that bad - but is it really 'Best Film' good? I rented Crash after Oscar night because, like most others given its Box-office gross, it had passed me by in the cinema. This was the film smart enough to outrun Brokeback mountain in the final furlong of the awards season. On what basis, has to be asked. Script, performances, message? All of which could be expected from a network special - although Sandra Bullock has not been reduced to doing TVMs yet so is, here, reassuringly dreadful as an L.A. W.A.S.P bitch. Otherwise, it's a mildly diverting set of story strands set in present day L.A expressed in the not wholly original terms of agitated Persian immigrants, poor latinos, misguided youths, alienated whites, corrupted cops and middle class blacks struggling against tacit racism and their own sense of inferiority. All of are markedly familiar, but in the context of 'Crash' put into a stew and stirred up with some dubious coincidences mixed into the plot. There are moments of tension, pathos (admittedly verging on rank sentimentalism) and humour but nothing revelatory or 'pushing the envelope' of racial depiction as some admirers suggest. Nor, indeed is the portmanteau format of interveawing stories in Los Angeles in itself original."

","It is not easy to figure out various characters'personality sharply with even showing time, as there may be a potential risk that hiding the core of the story. However, ""Crash' is not the case.<br/><br/>Even though there are so many main characters in the film, their own personalities and the incidents happened for them were still described in detail, no confusion and insufficient portrayal. It owes on the strange crossover which linked all characters in a proper time and scene. As a result, the showing time will not be over while the content became more attractive because of the interaction between the guys involved.<br/><br/>The core of the story is initiated by the sense of touch which was further developed in a different ways: a crash of the cars; knocking down of the old man; incivil touching to the wife of the director; and even the wrangle between those couples are also regards as conversation touching. How do the sense of touch raised various incidents in a short period of time(just 2 days, it also remind us that there are many unexpected things happened all around the world in every second. The film has shown various occasions with the time-line of 2 days, but which were held in US only), and if the touch is necessary or inevitable, is what the movie would like to point out.<br/><br/>Actually the answer was given at the ending in which the crash was happened again and it just like a cycle for what occurred in the beginning. No one can escape from touching each other in such a crowded city. We look like want to prevent it happen but instead, it make our life to be more diversified and fresh. A meaningful life should be taken in such way."

Nobody goes around as openly racist and bigoted as in this movie. There was some good acting. Sandra Bullock I think is highly overrated, but she was good as a crabby, bigoted woman. Matt Dillon was very good. I liked that he was bigoted in one scene, but then rescued the very woman he had alienated. The movie seemed to go along as a passable film until the last few scenes. Ryan Phillippe, for example, played Officer Tom Hansen. He was alienated by his partner John Ryan's (Matt Dillon) behavior when stopping a black couple. He ended up preventing a shooting situation by calming talking an angry black man whom he was familiar with out of waiving his gun around. Then, Officer Ryan is driving home late at night and picks up a total stranger. No one in L.A. picks up strangers at night. Officer Ryan ends up shooting the black youth passenger, because he falsely believes that he is getting a gun out of his jacket. Then, the youth passenger dies and turns out to be Detective Graham Walters' (Don Cheadles) brother. This made no sense, and Don Cheadles had one of his poorest performances. We never found out much about his character to really have much of any opinion about him, and to justify his poor role as an older brother. So, this movie was entertaining, but the movie became more and more implausible."

I wish this movie really did that important topic justice. But it doesn't. In fact, this movie instead proposes that: 1) People are generally malign and loathsome creatures regardless of race, creed, color or national origin and none of them can take any responsibility for their actions; 2) L.A. is a city filled with these creatures who are especially violent, thoughtless, and hateful -- stay away from Southern California at all costs; 3) There are really only about 21 people in L.A. and they all keep running into each other sort of like a ridiculous version of six degrees of separation; 4) When people occasionally do something good and righteous, it will either precede or be preceded by something equally evil and corrupt; 5) Racial stereotypes are pretty much true: Black women are mean-spirited overly aggressive shrews; white women are whiny, angry, spoiled brats; young black men are dangerous car jackers and white folks who don't know that are fools; immigrants from the middle east are not only angry and impatient, they will grab a gun and shoot you or your child dead if you don't fix their door (no...seriously...I am not exaggerating here); Black guys who get ahead feel guilty for not being a part of the neighborhood; White politicians are only interested in using people of color for their own political gain -- the list goes on; 6) Worst of all -- this movie purports that the world is a vicious and unpredictable environment regardless of any attempts we might make to better it. Better to just give up. For those who see any form of redemption in this movie, I suggest you were looking too hard. In the end the above six points make the movie not only a silly diatribe on a serious topic, but also offensive to the viewer regardless of your ethnicity.

To show us a splice of life, help us to see our ways as a society? If that was the objective, then the filmmakers must've lost their way right after the outline stage of the screenplay development process.<br/><br/>First of all, this has to be one of the most overrated films in the history of American cinema. What is that about? Doesn't mean that the film is the worse. It just doesn't deserve to be this flawless mediator of some kind that is capable of initiating open dialogue about the race issue in America. It's indeed a terribly flawed film with little or no respect for the collective intelligence and the imagination of the viewing audience.<br/><br/>It fails at character, where they're all paper thin caricatures of different individuals in urban America. Thugs that do nothing but debate about ""white America's"" hold on blacks. Whites that do nothing more than talk about how minorities bring down the nation, making it hard for decent white folk to live in their own cities or town. I mean, couldn't the characters be approached from a more original angle? And let's not forget the typical, racist, white, ""ni**er hating"" cop characters. I guess it failed because it was an ensemble with about two hours to tell all of the character's stories. In doing so, the story didn't allow for the characterizations to peel back, revealing to us true character in a believable fashion. All of their lives seem rushed in all of the events that had unfolded in the film.<br/><br/>And note to everyone: Besides Ludicrous, Larenz Tate and the Arabic guy, what were the object of desire for these pretentious characters? I saw the film when it came out a year ago and I'm now asking myself that question, but I can't answer it. Isn't the object of desire that ""thing"" that effortlessly exposes the truth about the characters, sometimes without a single word of dialogue? The film failed at dialogue. Too on the nose and absurd. The author of this script felt that it was necessary to spoon feed us everything we need to know about the characters in this film. When does spoon feeding ever work? And there was not a shred of believability in a single second of the film. You know why? Whatever happened in the end wasn't intelligently set up for us in the first three quarters of the film. You know why? Because there were two many characters and none of them evolved in the story or changed in a satisfying way.<br/><br/>Let me point out a few things in the story that wasn't believable. WARNING: There are spoilers below this point.<br/><br/>I don't know any black man who is out handling his business, whether it's positive or negative, and the whole time he's ranting about the plight of the black man and the conspiracy of the American government against blacks.<br/><br/>I never heard of any Arabic person in the history of America going down to the valio to kill a Mexican he ASSUMED (totally making an ass of only himself in this one) robbed him. And the Arabic man makes it out in one piece after attempting to kill the man and almost mistakenly killing his daughter? What? That can't happen in any neighborhood, whether it's the hood, the valio, the suburbs, where ever.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock's shallow character was visited by the three ghost of racism (like the three ghost of Christmas), unseen by us of course, and she finally realizes the potential of establishing a healthy companionship with the Mexican maid she was cursing at the top of the film, only because she twisted her ankle and the maid had helped her? What? Then that means, Bullock's character was a fraud. She was never prejudice in the first place, because it'll take more than the enemy assisting one with a twisted ankle to change one's mind about the enemy. I feel cheated. I want my money back...again.<br/><br/>And I don't care what anybody say. Thandie Newton fighting off the cop that felt her up as he tries to save her from a burning car that is about to EXPLODE is all BULLSH*T. I don't believe it. And I thought LA was bigger than that. The cop happens to arrive at the scene of an accident where the woman in trouble just happens to be the one he molested, giving him the convenient opportunity (not even in the worst fantasies) to redeem himself over night? I can ask this because I was born and raised in NYC and you're lucky to run into both the same cops twice. Newton runs into the one cop while Terrence Howard runs into the other cop at around the same time under two different circumstances? This film should've been called ""Coincidence."" And what's with Newton getting into this off screen car accident to add some weak suspense to the already muddle film? Didn't we already invest enough time into her story, as well as Howard's, to be left out of that near death incident (car accident)? There they go. Cheating me again.<br/><br/>See where I'm going here? Nothing in this film was believable. It was all hokey and manipulative to the weak minded, poor souls looking for any ole'film that can address race.<br/><br/>And to all those who label ""Crash"" as some fantasy film just to further debate all my quarrels with the damn film, you all know what you can do for me for trying to insult my intelligence.<br/><br/>Crash is not life."

The film centers on several subplots of Los Angeleans during a 48-hour time span. The story lines eventually merge and collide with issues of jealousy, morality, benevolence, conflict, libel, corruption, and on the forefront: race. The characters that drive ""Crash"" include: a district attorney & his domineering wife, a noble police officer & his Latin hottie partner/lover, a racist cop & his ethical rookie partner, a Puerto Rican locksmith & his devoted family, a successful African-American television director & his outspoken wife, a Hindu shop owner & his concerned family, and a couple of garrulous thugs. The performances by the actors which portray the aforementioned multicultural characters were bravura. This stellar ""crash unit"" includes Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Terrence Dashon Howard, Brandon Fraser, and Jennifer Esposito. Dillon, Howard, and Newton should crash their way to supporting acting Oscar nominations. In fact, The Oscar red carpet should already be designed with a welcome ""Matt"" for Dillon.

His efforts should be commended during awards season for both direction & screen writing. Or better stated, I doubt that Haggis will have to crash most of the upcoming movie awards ceremonies. So get your ""rear-end"" up and ""head-on"" to collide with the cinematic brilliance of ""Crash"". ***** Excellent"

","This film, which is the equivalent of a Masters Level multicultural class taught in 113 minutes...AND not boring...is a mirror that accurately reflects the reality of current society. Paul Haggis' brilliant writing, and the ensemble cast's amazing characterizations, subtly weave a story of cultural (mis)perceptions, stereotypes and the resulting interactions of virtually every nationality currently living in the LA area that reaches out, puts it's hands on either side of your face, and all but forces you look at the truth. Touching and tragic, this is an absolute must-see for anyone who even remotely wonders just what the hell is happening to our society as we move into the 21st century.

","This was a film with obvious artistic aspirations. Yet there were some huge plot problems that prevented it from being what it intended. Basically, the good actors in Crash deserved a better script. There was way too much reliance on coincidence in the story line. I could not suspend dramatic disbelief as people's lives kept criss-crossing and intersecting in ways that were totally implausible. The likelihood that this could have happened in a city as huge as Los Angeles is nil. The complex themes the film attempted to raise also deserved a more thorough treatment. This murky territory was better covered in Magnolia."

When so many art independent films come out every year from new directors coming from the inner cities and vets like Spike Lee making films actually about racism from a critical point of view, Crash wins ""Best Picture"" I shouldn't be able to get that but I do. Crash was made by cynical Angelenos with Academy votes. More clearly, white Angelenos with Academy votes. It's a grossly simplified sophomoric view at the great west coast metropolis. It's artsy only to the extent that it looks artsy. But the cast and everything else about smells Hollywood. It tries to be something it isn't, and it comes off as racist, simple-minded, hyperbolic, and corny. Every cast member is stereotyped, every character is cookie-cutter and the directing and editing is stolen from a highly superior film, Magnolia, which is underrated and unappreciated compared to this pretentious crap."

Like ""Miami Vice"" very few recall the stories but all recall the pastels and unshaven faces, ""Crash"" tried to capture the seedy part of Los Angeles, not by filming the grit but used technology to make everything gritty looking.<br/><br/>It's a good film. Following the same story type as ""Go"" or ""Magnolia"" it is a fascinating story of interwoven lives and how we all touch each other eventually. It uses the same basic theme that all conflict is a statement of prejudice and it is a roller coaster of emotions, some honest, come contrived. The cast is simply wonderful. Each character is believable. The funny parts are very funny and the sad parts are very sad. If you liked ""Go"" or ""Magnolia"" you will like this film every bit as much."

The only characters that change are the two racist white characters. What's the point? If all non-white people are stereotypes, what type of message is that sending? And only racists are redeemable? How this won Best Picture is beyond me.<br/><br/>Not that the movie is all bad. Despite the contrivances of the script and the poor direction, all of the actors and actresses are on their game, with especially good performances from Matt Dillon and Sandra Bullock (the only two given meat), along with Don Cheadle and Terrence Howard.

Because sometimes, people CRASH into each other, just to feel something. Get it? They CRASH into each other. Just like the title of the movie! It's about as subtle as a jackhammer on concrete. This movie's idea of cleverness was to have a rapper give s speech in which he says rap music was created by whitey to keep the black man down. I might have been willing to go along with it all if any of the characters behaved in ways that were believable. Instead, they just represented various aspects of race, class and prejudice. The whole thing felt like an after school special. Tell me a story, don't get on your soapbox and preach. If I want a sermon I'll go to church."

We in America are eons beyond the racism that this film depicts. The makers of the film are in my mind the true racists. I remember a book called LIBERAL RACISM that sums this up completely (the author is Jim Street, as I recall). Read it. <br/><br/>Two black guys walk down the street in a white neighborhood. One says, ""Why aren't we afraid?"" The other says, ""Because we have guns."" Then they hijack the SUV of the District Attorney and his wife.

If issues of race and class weren't so important it would just be dreck edging on camp. As it is, it's a disgrace.

Racism is born out of ignorance, fear, and resistance to changes, those all happen to be human nature, and can hardly been easily profiled. However, this movie overuses profiling and dramatization, the approach itself represents the essence of Racism.<br/><br/>It is OK trying to make a point.

We do good and bad things occasionally, but who is going to judge what's right and what's wrong when we have no idea about who the people are that live around us. People don't function on the same psychology; this film tries to classify people under one roof. All ethnicities come with a different set of laws and ideas, and when you have all these different people living in one city there is going to be a clash between cultures no matter what. Racism is not going to stop, you can change one racist but can you change all? That's somewhat of a pessimistic view... but hey don't blame me, that's reality. We're all animals. You can tame Dogs and cats to get along, but for how long? There is eventually going to be some conflict.<br/><br/>Yes some of the events in the film do happen in real life and especially in Los Angeles, but the greater point that we're forgetting is: Why do these events happen? First of all because our government does not give a crap, second because people have no intellect, third because we're always pressured into doing what's ""right"" in the publics eye, and finally because films like this are made that make life seem so simple and brainwash people when in reality racism is not the biggest problem we face globally. But of course the audience won't be interested in these important details because they're all busy eating popcorn and wiping the tears from their eyes. Ahhhh stop crying and start realizing that you're human and accepting the fact that you're nothing in a universe of nothing.<br/><br/>I should also mention that the music in the film sucked!

"aciessi","4","3","5","5 April 2020"," Best Picture?
","Crash is an exercise of self-aggrandizement and hollow morality. It wants to be something so edgy and different, yet profound. To put it in another way, Crash thinks its woke. Like, super woke. In reality, it's in a coma. It's message is irreparably bungled.<br/><br/>Everyone in this movie is a racist. The cop, the actor, the criminal, the district attorney and his wife, the shop keeper, et al. Their racism, so to say, is unrealistically performed. How overt racism is in our society depends on certain discrepancies such as wealth and intelligence (though, not always mutually exclusive to that). Here, everyone and is an out and out bigot, and proud to be one at that. To that effect, we aren't emotionally invested in anything that's happening onscreen. It's hard to take any of these characters seriously when they all sound like Archie Bunker.<br/><br/>Which makes the film's most significant moments all the more perplexing. For two scenes in particular, Crash suddenly becomes a riveting, deeply moving drama. The car crash rescue scene comes to mind. In this moment, the film explores the complexities of humanity when a predator cop, who sexually assaults Thandie Newton's character in another scene, comes to her rescue in a fiery car crash that nearly takes her life. The confusion, disgust and desperation that Thandie Newton conveys here is a truly incredible acting feat. This scene alone nearly redeems Crash in every capacity. Crash, in the end, would have worked much better as a slice of life ensemble piece, similar to Magnolia.
It doesn't work as a film about race. Not even a little bit. Should you want to watch a better film on that topic, Do The Right Thing does the trick every time."

I live in Australia and if America is actually like this with people straight out saying ""damn black people"" you guys have serious issues, at least TRY to be subtle.<br/><br/>The whole movie just pushes the issue down your throat, at times it doesn't even make sense. There is a scene where a cop see a chick giving a guy head in a guy, the headlights make the chick look white and when they pull them over she says ""You just couldn't deal with a white chick giving a black dude head"" or something like that, how the hell could she have known he thought she was white? Think about it. There is also a scene where a father says ""Are you worried about a bullet coming through your window like at our last house?"", who talks like that? Obviously she would know what that a bullet came through the window at her old house, he doesn't need to say it, it's just poor writing. Don't even get me started on the scene where that Indian dude shoots the daughter, a miracle? Use your brain Paul Haggis, so cheap.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not good either. The whole plot is so uninteresting it will put you to sleep.

CRASH feels more like a vehicle for stars to get some experience being actors, than an independent film with a lot of stars in it.<br/><br/>Even if the whole story doesn't come together there are some good scenes. The rapper, Ludicrous has a few. In one he rants about rap music being an FBI conspiracy. Matt Dillon, Ryan Philleppe, and Don Cheadle are goodas usual. The only reason Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser seemed to be in this film is they both had a chance to play rolls that are the opposite of their type.

CRASH is not only unworthy of the Best Picture Oscar, it is unworthy of a nomination in the category. The Academy chose this contradictory diatribe about racism over such better films as MUNICH, GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK, and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. What a shame. For this, and other reasons, the Oscar voters have become a pointless and arcane clique that is easily swayed by multi-million dollar advertising campaigns. I will never regard the awards as anything more than a popularity contest, as CRASH no doubt proves. Sadly, this is what the Academy Awards have been reduced to. A genuine tragedy."

What about the story ? Can those coincidences be realistic ? Absolutely NO ! Don't pull my leg, please ! The way Crash plagiarized Magnolia and House of Sand and Fog (two movies I totally LOVED) was nauseating. The final scene was copied and pasted by Magnolia replacing the frogs with the snow.

"dellamer","1","7","17","27 June 2006"," Un-believable for various reasons
","Following the outcome of the latest Academy Awards with Crash surprising everyone by getting the Oscar for Best Picture, I thought I should perhaps see this film. I watched it with the best intentions and an open mind. I really thought I would like it because I knew it dealt with an interesting subject matter.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the truth is that, while watching Crash, I really had the impression that I was simply watching a TV program, some kind of ""bad cop/good cop"" TV show. Nonetheless, I still found Crash to be an OK movie, a ""movie with good intentions"", but overall, just an ordinary made-for-TV movie. I thought it was too simplistic and, in some ways, childish in its treatment & development to be worthy of any significant praise. The first line uttered by Don Cheadle at the beginning of the film is so unnatural, unrealistic, and moralizing that my reaction was: ""What?! Do they think we're stupid?"" The problem with this film is that it is ""pushing"" a moral. It aims to carry a ""message"" and does so without finesse or subtlety. It is done so that the ""not-so-bright"" gets the message, i.e. ""we're all racists, let's all love and accept one another, ... and, if necessary, let's crash into one another in order to touch one another""(!). I personally do not particularly like ""preachy"" movies and, Crash IS preachy. This film could really have been entitled ""Racism 101"", ""Racism for Dummies"", or even better ""Racist Stereotypes - Advanced Level"". Mind you, I do not live in LA nor in the US, and I realize that such a film is perhaps necessary.<br/><br/>I really thought that the storyline was ""un-believable"". This sequence of coincidences is so contrived and artificial that, after just a few minutes, you can clearly see the pattern established, you can predict the ""surprises"" and, as the film goes on, you then automatically expect the ""unexpected"". It seems like the makers of this film are simply trying too hard. It considerably reduces the credibility of the film.<br/><br/>It is un-believable that this film won the Oscar for Best Picture. How did that happen?! In any case, the Oscars have hit a new low.<br/><br/>It is un-believable, and sad, that the Academy actually fell for the persistent and aggressive Oscar campaign orchestrated by the producers of Crash. Actually, the simple thought that these awards are earned through of a pushy ""Oscar campaign"" makes me wince... So much for the credibility of poor old Oscar.<br/><br/>Let's face it, Crash did create quite a ""coup"" on Oscar night for a movie that had quickly sunk into oblivion last summer. After all, it only ranked 58th in the 2005 year-end compilation of film reviews in the March issue of Premiere Magazine and was not even nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes. Despite the fact that Crash addresses the touchy issue of racism in LA, many reviews in reputed publications, including the LA Times, were rather negative mentioning how manipulative and unrealistic it was, and how it ""exploited stereotypes"". After watching the movie, I personally felt as if I probably needed to be more wary of people of other races. I felt that it only ""reinforced"" and ""validated"" existing negative stereotypes. Now, was that the intention of the film? I doubt it, but facile stereotypes are used without any restraint throughout.<br/><br/>In the end, I think that host Jon Stewart summed it up pretty well on Oscar night when, in order to save time, he said ""Whoever was NOT in Crash, please raise your hands"". He simply reminded us that Crash is ABOUT LA, was shot IN LA, and gave work to A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM LA, and of course, all these people FROM LA voted for themselves, probably also getting the votes of their colleagues and friends in the film industry (everybody would have done the same). But, was Crash really the Best Picture of 2005? I think that the answer is pretty clear and obvious: NO.<br/><br/>After receiving over two dozens of Best Picture Awards around the world, the extraordinary and unforgettable Brokeback Mountain should of course have won the Academy Award for Best Picture which it truly deserved. An upset of this magnitude is without precedent in Oscar history and, it is simply unjustifiable and scandalous. Everybody seemed extremely surprised, even, of course, the Crash winners. The Academy has completely discredited itself. Brokeback Mountain was from the start simply outnumbered in this specific ""LA-based"" organization which is, as it just proved, very self-centered and preoccupied in glorifying itself. It was clearly demonstrated, once again, that in the Academy, ""inside politics"" and other dubious factors have more importance over true artistic value.<br/><br/>I personally think that, as Crash's big Oscar rival, Brokeback Mountain might have been too subtle, too true, too profound, simply too good for the Hollywood peanut gallery. The impact of BBM has been absolutely ""historical"" in scope. Brokeback Mountain will remain a milestone in cinematic history. This film has been talked about all over the world and has attained unprecedented international acclaim - the ""Brokeback phenomenon"" has significantly crossed borders and has reached numerous foreign countries. Rarely have we seen a film have such an impact on society, in the media, and with the general public, even on those who haven't seen it or did not have the courage to see it. In no way can Crash measure up to any of this.<br/><br/>Crash does have its merits but, by fetching the Best Picture Oscar through a desperate and very costly campaign, it showed that with money, you can make people believe anything. It also proved how irrelevant, unimportant and meaningless the Oscars and the Academy really are."

To be honest, I really thought Brokeback Mountain would have taken Best Picture, but Crash did the surprise turn of the Oscars and took it.<br/><br/>***************SCENE SPOILER*************** <br/><br/>Now, in my opinion still, Brokeback should have taken the Oscar, let's face it though, the Oscars are loosing their touch. But Crash is still undoubtedly haunting and very true. It's a terrific movie that makes us look twice at the way we talk and treat people of the other race. The one thing I really loved about this film was the redemption of all the characters at the end. My favorite scene was when an Arab man's store is robbed, so he wants to kill the man who installed his locks, but when outside the man's home he is confronted by the Arab, the guy's little daughter jumps in front right as the Arab takes a shot, lucky enough the gun's bullets were blanks. But it was if the child was an angel protecting both men.<br/><br/>Crash is a beautifully haunting masterpiece that everyone needs to watch due to the fact that we need to take a good look at ourselves every once in a while. We all could relate to this film and that's what made it great. It was just utterly heart breaking, but so true. Every character made a round about sort of speak and realized the error of their ways. That's why this is an important film.<br/><br/>The movie not only makes us realize how much anger is in our lives but also how much we need to control it. I never thought that a movie like this could come out, but I give the screen writers an incredible amount of credit and thanks for helping us realize the daily hatred we have and need to get rid of.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I am a passionate student of Dickens, preferring his more somber works such as Bleak House to his sillier fare. But even that sillier fare (Great Expectations, Oliver Twist ...)somehow managed to find the human truth of each character, and explore the important social themes of his day, among the improbable and unexpected plot twists. Crash, written and directed by Paul Haggis, is a film that Dickens would have made if he were alive today.<br/><br/>The negative reviews I have read on this clearly have missed the point - ""Crash"" was overtly trying to be Dickenesque while taking-on a major social issue of today - internal and external racism among black, white, Asian, Hispanic, Persians and various other Americans. Yes, at times it's improbable, but never illogical or impossible. And isn't that like the after effect of a real crash? You never know where the pieces are going to end up, sometimes in the most unlikely of place, but that they got to their destination is a simple and undeniable fact of physics.<br/><br/>Just like Dickens, but in less than 2 hours, you come to intimately know 8 major characters and 10 minor characters. But more importantly, each of these characters give you an insight into your own thoughts, prejudices and self-delusions. The bottom line here is that racism exists because we are sure we know exactly who and what the ""other"" is; however, that ""other"" is always far more complex than our racism will let us admit. The secret truth to this movie is that we may think we know who we are as well, yet our own racism is far more complex and affecting than we will ever admit.<br/><br/>Haggis gets the best from his actors. Matt Dillon gives the performance he's been wanting to do for 20 years, as does Sandra Bullock and Brandon Frasier. And Crash answers the question which no one would ever have dared to ask ... Tony Danza actually can act, and act well. Who would have thought? Don Cheadle proves that Hotel Rwanda was not just a one-shot acting triumph. Even better, Haggis gets sterling performances out of a number of actors, many of whom you'll recognize from phoned-in performances from other lesser films and TV experiences who suddenly flower and deliver under this director's attention.<br/><br/>The pace and editing of the film is amazing.<br/><br/>This is probably the best film I have seen yet this millennium. It's worth seeing at least twice."

","I hope this film is remembered at Oscar time. It is simply brilliant. Haggis is a master craftsman. ""Crash"" should be required watching in every high school. On the surface racism rings out as the pervading theme, but it goes so far beyond that. Watching it one week after hurricane Katrina walloped the Gulf Coast made ""Crash"" more relevant than ever. We are a world fueled by anger that stems from misunderstanding and ignorance. That's it, in a nutshell. There are scenes in this film that I will never forget. Don Cheadle's final scene with his mother. Sandra Bullock hugging her maid. The impenetrable cloak put to a test. There are some films with great promise coming out between now and the end of the year, but I doubt any of them will come close to this masterpiece."

The viewer is exposed to the very best and the very worst in many of the characters over that brief period. What a ride! Take tissues. My second viewing was even better, and more emotional than the first! Don't miss this! Take friends, and family. This is appropriate for all sensibilities, but not the very young.

","Very little is left to the imagination in this film. Instead of showing real characters, this film is focused on portraying moral lessons about racism in the United States. Though a noble and needed gesture, it's execution is poorly done while mocking the critical-thinking moviegoer. Instead of raising questions about our social situation, or arousing our capacity for change, the film forces its thoughts, emotions and lessons upon the viewer.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Sandra Bullock step out of her comfort zone and successfully attempt a new genre. She uses her grace against her, and it works magnificently. Matt Dillion, Michael Pena, Thandie Newton, and Terrence Howard also deserve to be mentioned for their beautiful portrayal of the intertwined characters in LA.<br/><br/>As for the general layout of the film, it appears that the film unsuccessfully borrows devices that are used in ""Magnolia"" to achieve a lasting impression in film history. Though both films are melodramatic, ""Magnolia"" uses Brechtian elements allowing the audience to question their relationships and realities, whereas ""Crash"" merely forces its idea of reality into the viewers laps.<br/><br/>Lastly, ""Crash"" contains contrived sequences, actions and scenes that seem to merely enforce the racist theme they were aiming to achieve. Instead of intellectually reaching the audience with their point, these filmmakers decided to smash it over the audiences' headsand if you didn't get it the first time, they bash it over you a couple more times before the film finishes."

"drpakmanrains","10","4","8","1 April 2012"," Sorry! I loved this movie.
","There's something amiss here. How can 80% of the user ratings be 7 to 10 stars, while the majority of the written reviews are 1 to 5 stars. Did only those 15% bother to write a review? I think it richly deserved the Oscar, at least based on the ones it was up against. Yes it was contrived, yes it was not subtle, yes it dwelled unrealistically on racism. Yes it is not a true depiction of L.A. But it was extremely entertaining, and had some amazingly powerful emotional moments, however unlikely. I am not an idiot, nor a simpleton. I have a doctorate from UCLA. I have seen over 2500 films, and own over 500 DVD's. Many I have seen multiple times, going back to the 1950's. Crash wove at least seven stories with multiple characters into a coherent and fascinating FICTIONAL story about racism in L.A. in a 48 hour period. It wasn't meant to be realistic, just interesting and satisfying, depicting the worst and best behavior in a condensed provocative manner. Just about everyone I know loved the film, and I stood and cheered when it won over Brokeback Mountain, which if you took out the gay aspect, would have been a deadly dull film. Before anyone accuses me of homophobia, I have nearly a dozen gay themed films that I think are excellent. (Patrik age 1,5 and A Very Serious Person are two that come to mind.) So my advice is to go more by the user ratings than the user reviews if by some chance you have yet to see Crash. And not all 5000 Academy voters are idiots, as one reviewer accused. Acting is a very difficult profession, where one has to be able to memorize scripts and be an outstanding observer of character types, then be able to get into a character so thoroughly that they become that person. I once had to help a friend make a video for a thesis, and I found it to be extremely difficult. Anyway, with apologies to all who hated this film, I stand by my 10, and think the odds are 8 in 10 you will at least like it."

","Now don't get me wrong... this is a great movie, and I am in no way saying it is over-exaggerating the problems of prejudice in big cities like LA.I'm just saying it could have been much better. Starting with the pros: It was a good script, with good directing and good cinematography. It held my interest from beginning to end, and there were several tear-jerking emotional scenes in there. ""Crash"" also had it's fair share of (incredibly) dark humor which leave you amused yet horrified at the same time. And now on to the cons... One huge problem in this movie was the casting. In several cases, the quieter, calmer scenes were over-acted, which made what might have been great lines unbelievable. The actors themselves are not bad at all, but they felt a little awkward in these specific roles. If the casting were a bit better, there would have been just one more problem for the movie, which is... subtlety. (of which this film has none) With all movies, there is a message that is trying to be conveyed. In great movies like Slumdog Millionaire, The Wall, and Doubt, the message is very subtle, as opposed to painfully obvious and screaming off the screen. The entire message of this movie was ""Racist people live in Los Angeles"", and it felt like that message was being shoved down my throat through a funnel that was way too small. Call me crazy, but this blatant preaching is a big pet peeve of mine in movies. So my overall consensus: A great movie, but there were others that should have gotten best picture over it."

But the pure guile of it that this shows is not so true anymore, except in more isolated areas. However I am not denying that its still there.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it really doesn't come off as something that made me want to watch this again.

"narbo","9","4","8","23 February 2007"," Ideology not racism
","In terms of being a great film, this film is indeed flawed. It often feels like an episode of a TV show (namely hill street blues or the like), and the final 15 min seems to force an ending while sentimental pop songs play over top. <br/><br/>That being said I have to applaud some of the ideas this film is able to work through , its cast, Paul Haggis, and some of the Eastern influenced music in the first part of the film. <br/><br/>People who dislike this film tend to describe it as simply a film with a message, and talk about it as merely a film about racism. People who tend to enjoy this film tend to pinto to one moment as encapsulating the whole of the story , and that is the moment where Sandra Bullock' s character says "" I feel so scared and angry all the time, and I just don't know why"". Of course her friend loses interest in speaking to her at this precise moment, indicating the fact that friend doesn't want to discuss such a dark complex issue. This is about ideology, not racism. For those who dismiss the film as simply ask yourself why the film is arced by the story of Don Cheadles finding his brother's body and his mother's lost faith in him. does that story line have to do with racism? I think not. <br/><br/>If one approaches the film as being about ideology and not simply racism the film becomes a much more tightly wound and focused piece. The gun shop owner, the most overtly racist character in the film, feels just as out of place in his country as the women he speaks his vile words to. One of the interesting the films does is portray characters in a certain light and then play your preconceived notions against you. Matt Dillon is very racist to a woman, yet saves her life. His duty as a police officer and his obligations toward another human being outweigh his racist ideals, and thus he is forced to act. ( my favourite moment is when Thany Newton looks back and shakes her head no, as if his actions have complicated him in such a way that she cannot reason). Terrence Howard stand by as his wife is violated, but later he tries to redeem himself by over reacting. Ryan Philippe must save him feeling a sense of guilt knowing what the man has gone through. Both men have pushed them to the limits of their understanding of themselves. Finally we are given Michael Pena's character who is attacked by the Persian man ( a minority attacking another minority), but the gun does not go off.<br/><br/>What we are given is elevating situations of people's humanity overriding their values to reveal a deeper loyalty to their fellow human beings than even they may realize they have ever had. The question is never why they react the way they did, the trouble for each is that their hesitation to act appropriately in the first place forced them into far more volatile situations. their understanding of themselves is complicated but their deeper humanity is revealed.<br/><br/>Many people ind the scene with Pena screaming as his daughter is shot, but the gun not going off as hokey. However, I think the moment serves as a moment of suggesting that the lines that separate people are often arbitrarily made ( ie NOT divinely ordained). Whereas the uniting forces are in fact naturally occurring and not merely social designs.<br/><br/>Ultimately, as I said, the film works through a few powerful ideas (Think Foucault, Said, Rushdie), but fails in some ways. But Haggis set out a lofty task for himself and came as close to succeeding as is possible."

It's not particularly clever or original, and I suspect that, just because it deals with racism so overtly, people are willing to shower it with praise - which it doesn't actually deserve - because it is not PC to trash insightful, provocative (ahem) social commentaries. In addition the characterisation is virtually non-existent; given that there are so many characters, they each do not get very much screen time.

","No, I'm not one of those hysterical fans of ""Brokeback Mountain"" who hardly stand ""Crash""'s victory in the Oscar night. Awards, for me, are irrelevant.<br/><br/>But I wonder how one silly screenplay like this won an election with more than 6000 voters as the Academy Award... especially, when 99,99999% of them are older than 8. Okay okay, I am I, they are they.<br/><br/>Okay. The film was filmed in the classic way, a story with three acts. The first act: presentation of the story and the characters. Second act: 'the happenings'. Third act: the consequences. Not exactly like that - but the characters, not necessarily in the chronology of the movie, follow this dramatic circle. Til here, no problems.<br/><br/>Let's begin the show. In the first part of the characters, it's hardly to find one unique conversation that can't be classified with ""racism & prejudice discussion"". OK, this is a film about racism, so it's natural; but all this kind of thing gets boring and all the characters loses a bit of their humanity with this stuff. I would let it pass if the dialogs were well written, but unfortunately this isn't the case. What everyone would say about that ridiculous Ludicrous's character? The only moments with him was when he had 'intelligent chats' about racism (and some things like ""the bus windows are racist""... hilarious) just before steal a car. All of the dialogs explicitly about prejudice (especially Ludicrous's and Sandra Bullock's (the conversation with her husband after the robbery is embarrassing)). Y'know, Bullock's character could be more complex and her dialogs would be justified, but Haggis prefer to do she as 'the woman who receives violence and misjudges black and Latin people.<br/><br/>In fact, I would spent so much time explaining how the characters of ""Crash"" have a horrible construction. The characters of Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, who represents the white racists, are limited to construction who lets us to think "" it's just this?"". It's too superficial. With two or three exceptions, all of the prejudice feelings of them are justified in the most obvious way. With maybe the exception of the doubtful Cameron (Terrence Howard) and the hesitating Hanson (Ryan Philippe). All the others are unidimensional persons from a parallel reality, Haggis's reality.<br/><br/>Let's go to the happenings. The scene when cop Ryan (Matt Dillon) interacts with Christine (Thandie Newton) and Cameron (Terrence Howard) and all the discussion after it in the couple is awesome - just when the theme to reflect is not racism but police repression, something that Haggis shouldn't have predicted. The scene Ryan Philippe and Howard (again...) as protagonists is too damn good. But are isolated points. And the conversation between Graham (Don Cheadle) and Conklin (Martin Norseman) is excellent too, because criticize one terrible and few discussed face of racial tension: political correction.<br/><br/>But it's really sad to see this good scenes mixed in a film with craps like the scene with Michael Peña, he's daughter and an stereotyped gun nut Arab is ridiculous. It's embarrassing to see that Haggis would think that we would believe in that sh*t. The second scene concerning Dillon's and Newton's characters it's ridiculous for two reasons: the insulting way the story characterizes them and the way Haggis direct. Among with this scene, the redeemer scene of Sandra Bullock competes one of the most shameful moments of cinema. This Canadian directs with the unique intention of make people cry - he abuses of slow-motions, super-mega-ultra-closes and silly melodramatic songs. To complete, he propose unexplainable changes in the personality of the characters to people say: ""Look folks, humans are contradictory"". Ha ha ha.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis seems to live in an universe that's is not the same as mine. Because I don't live in a world where people are flags of prejudice or anything else - humans are more than that. To complete, Haggis's LA seems to have about... 100 habitants? These stories are connected, but the way he did it insulted my intelligence! When the movie finished I felt just like I said. Insulted. How in Earth a man would think that someone older than 8 would believe in too many stereotype persons, symbols of the political correction critic of racism? How he would believe that someone would accept his silly, coincidental universe? I take the risk to say that this film is racist because this generalization of LA's citizens in those pre-fabricated models of a prejudicial society. Appealing this way, he proposes the more simple solution: if the races don't crash, it would be easier.<br/><br/>A shame. Really."

It is a shame that Hollywood and the Universities churn out these monsters of negation and futility with frightening regularity.<br/><br/>This is not art which has a social message. It is a ""socially conscious soap opera"" ... it is As The World Turns with a Puritanical American Liberal social message about race. Even though the writer tries very hard not to be conventional and to show us how daring he is, in the end the poor guy is trapped by his conventionality and lack of talent. It is the height of daring for this poor fellow to venture to show us that many people of all races distrust and are fearful of other races, that races can sometimes come together, and that life doesn't always have a happy ending.

","'Crash' blew me away after I saw it the first time. I was still blown away the second time I watched it. And the third. And, you guessed it, the fourth. Just 17, I had never really bothered with films that weren't Spider-Man, X-Men, or Harry Potter, until 2005. Then I saw 'Crash', this incredible motion picture from Paul Haggis. Seeing this movie woke me up in every aspect of life, including my outlook on life, race, and the hardships of living. The movie focuses on several characters, with near perfect performances from the cast, which consists of: Oscar Nominee Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillippe, Oscar Nominee Terrence Howard, Oscar Nominee Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, William Fichtner, Michael Pena, Brendan Fraser, Larenz Tate, and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges.<br/><br/>The film, as you probably know, is about how the lives of all these people, their stories, if you will, intertwine over one 36 hour period in Los Angeles. All of their stories will CRASH together because of racial issues, corruption, or other things. A movie full of twists and turns, it will seem a little confusing at first, but at about the 1 and a quarter hour mark, it will all make sense, and that confusion will be replaced with understanding of why and how that particular event occurred.<br/><br/>This is the mark of the excellent directing of Paul Haggis (writer of Million Dollar Baby) and the fantastic cast (especially Bullock, Howard, Bridges, and Dillon) right here: during the movie, you will feel as if you are not watching a movie about the characters, but getting a look into the lives of these 11 people, because it is so well-acted and well-directed that you won't be able to tell a difference. The picture's Oscar nominated song (Bird York's 'In The Deep') best describes it: when you first hear the song, it's like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Should it be a dramatic song, a tragic song, or a romantic song? The movie is the same way. At the beginning, the character's do not know who they are and what they are doing, but by the ending, each one of them will have undergone a transformation that leaves them knowing exactly who they are and why they are where they are. It is so incredibly powerful, that more than one scene can bring you to tears, but at the same time, sarcastic one-liner's are thrown in to keep the mood right.<br/><br/>Never before has an ensemble cast been this good, and while Dillon's Oscar nomination was nice, I believed that Sandra Bullock and Terrence Howard should have gotten one as well. Dillon is the best out of all, however, and I think he represented the entire cast at the Oscars. We get a surprising turn from Bullock, who has never really been taken seriously in movies before, but she is wonderful in this. Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges breaks the mold as a 'rapper-turned-actor'. He is just an actor. His performance is so convincing that you'll forget that he's a rapper. In fact, he even makes a joke about how bad hip-hop music is at one point. Terrence Howard was not only Oscar worthy in MTV's Sundance Stud, 'Hustle & Flow', but he was fantastic in Crash as a man who is unstable with his wife after an 'episode' with a police officer (you'll see), and another 'dispute' with a man (once again, you'll see). Ryan Phillippe also turns in a nice performance, as do Larenz Tate and William Fichtner in supporting roles. Don Cheadle's character is probably what you'd call the main character, as most of the intersecting events do affect him, even though he isn't present at all of them. Once again, he does a great job of reminding you of what a screen presence he is. The biggest surprise of the movie to me was Michael Pena. I had never seen him before, and was moved by his performance as well. Pena's character is probably the only truly good and moral character in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis wrote and directed this film (written with assistance from Bobby Moresco), and he accomplished the goal that I'm sure was this film's: let the audience know that sometimes, the world isn't always perfect, and people are affected by actions as little telling your daughter about an imaginary impenetrable cloak. This is a movie you will remember forever, and I'm sure you'll spread the word. It deserved the Best Picture Oscar it won.<br/><br/>Just remember: Moving at the speed of life, we are bound to collide with each other.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"

There's a good and an evil side in every one of us and sometimes it's necessary to ""crash"" into something to see who we really are. The cast is great, there's not a leading role in anyone of the actors, but everyone does his job in a perfect way. In the movie we can see different people, living different lives, and then they'll come ""crash"" together in a melting pot of situations, guilty and redemption, racism and love, but in the end everyone must fight his own demons.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is really a great movie, everyone must see that and enjoy this rare example of fine cinematography."

","I was finally cornered into watching this movie last night. Although the movie had some biting dialogue in the beginning, I found it to get overly staged and unbelievable pretty quick. By trying to show you that people aren't always as they seem, it ends up as an unrealistic and unnecessarily angry film. Starting about halfway through movie, the film makers start to be more concerned with tying everything up in a bunch of coincidences and karma than keeping the film plausible. In the end you're left with plot holes the size of Los Angeles and unintentionally funny incidents that make no sense. The actors give it their best shot, but cannot save it. Certain scenes should have been rewritten and tweaked and it may have worked.<br/><br/>Also, is it just me.. or are actors Don Cheadle and Tim Meadows from Saturday Night Live twins separated at birth?"
"explodingcat","2","6","14","19 October 2005"," Overdone
","Racial problems exist everywhere, and why they do and what troubles they manifest has been done before and done better. This movie has the subtlety of a sledgehammer, every character ( of which there are way too many to flesh out completely, leaving them as 2D cut - outs) acts illogically and be in the middle of a monologue about race relations when we meet them. Subtlety is sorely lacking in this self righteous piece. The movie also falls into the trap of fitting most of the characters into racial stereotypes, stereotypes which made me cringe. This is race relations complete with car chases, explosions and ridiculous unlikely coincidences. Heavyhanded and overdone, this movie ends up taking an issue which is pretty critical and making it near laughable."

","A snooty lawyer and his angry wife are carjacked by two black men. A light skinned black director and his wife are mis-treated by a racist white cop after getting pulled over for a traffic violation. A Russian store owner who doesn't speak much English, gets broken into and blames a poor Latino locksmith for his trouble. A black cop is worried that his relationship with his Mexican female partner will upset his colleagues and mother, who he has an estranged relationship with. All these stories are intertwined to form an arc and all come together at the end to state a message about our society and how it deals with race.<br/><br/>In the tradition of Robert Altman's fine films like ""The Player"", and ""Short Cuts"", as well as Lawrence Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"", ""Crash"" does a wonderful job at mixing and matching a number of characters and stories and having them all come together. This film has amazing writing and performances. The characters are all real and they seem like people you've probably met before. Director Paul Haggis, who just won an Oscar for ""Million Dollar Baby"" really does a great job at balancing everyone and giving each story equal screen time.<br/><br/>This is an intense film at times and each character's story packs some emotional punch.

For those of you who are looking for a blow-by-blow summary of the movie, all I can really say is that I can't explain it; you really have to see it for yourself, and that's to be taken literally. All of the characters and plot lines are so intricately interwoven together that it takes a flowchart to truly understand it without it being seen.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that ""Crash"" isn't without its flaws. Some of the twists seem a bit far-fetched to me, such as a racist cop who feels a woman up ending up rescuing her the very next day, or another cop trying to intervene on a black screenwriter's behalf, and that's only two small parts out of over 40!

Obviously, it doesn't matter how strong the script is, if it's transformation to the big screen is sloppy, but with Crash, one of those rare things has happened: One of those rare things some call Oscar material. The multi lined story has been excellently transferred to the screen and the final product is like a perfectly tuned symphony: No note is false, and as the band plays, you get swept away by their music.

","Oh boy. As a feminist accidentally born with testicles, I can tell you, there's nothing I look forward to more than a film reminding me how privileged white males like myself are the scum of the Earth. I generally use movies like this as a sort of intellectual self-flogging to make up for the thousands of years of oppression my people have caused the entire world. This one, however, didn't amount to much more than a sappy, manipulative Disneyesque take on the state of racism in the United States.<br/><br/>We know we're in trouble early on when Sandra Bullock's privileged character warns her liberal husband to be worried about two African-American gentlemen on the street and she turns out to be correct. It's like the film is shooting itself in its foot from the get-go. Afircan-Americans should NEVER be portrayed in a negative light on film or in television. They've suffered enough. <br/><br/>Later, we meet an atrociously disgusting white police officer in the character of Matt Dillon. He molests an innocent African-American woman (as one suspects white police officers are apt to do on a regular basis) and then, as though the film wants to make some clever statement about irony, the same racist cop saves the same poor, innocent African-American woman from a burning car. The director plays games like this with the audience throughout the picture. It's like he's learned the very worst lessons Spielberg has to offer. Set the audience up, smack them sideways in a manner the filmmaker no doubt considers ""clever."" It's not. <br/><br/>The whole movie reminded me of the patronizing scene in Schindler's List when Liam Neeson notices white flakes in the air. The audience thinks, ""Snow! Christmastime! Yeah!"" and then he walks a few blocks and we see it is actually ashes from burning Jews. Crash is nothing but an endless series of episodes like this. It looks like it was written by a freshmen cultural studies major who hasn't had enough Liberal Arts training to learn how to make his art subtle and, thus, more meaningful. Avoid this at all costs. <br/><br/>For a great movie to feed your white guilt, I recommend ""The Brother from Another Planet."""
"lisaoklahoma","1","5","11","9 May 2009"," Racism 101
","The main problem with Crash is that it attempts to attack stereotypes by using stereotypical characters. Everyone in this movie is simply a prop for the movie's message about racism. I'm not sure exactly what that message was, but I'll get to that.<br/><br/>I dislike the trend in recent years towards movies with multiple plots. Some people seem to think multiple plots make a movie more meaningful, but I think they make it less so. Multiple plots are lazy and ensure that a movie will never have to fully explore the personalities and hidden motivations of its characters. In the case of ""Crash,"" every plot in the movie is related to another, and the way in which they all just happen to intertwine becomes Ludicrous. (The site won't let me misspell this)<br/><br/>Most of the people in this movie have racist attitudes, but ""Crash"" portrays them in such a sympathetic light that you end up thinking they have a right to be the way they are. Sandra Bullock's character is wary of black people, but then her wariness seemingly becomes justified when some black people steal her SUV. Matt Dillon's character molests a random black woman by the side of the road, but later he ends up saving that very same woman from a burning car. Look at that, people! He may be racist, but in spite of that, he's an outstanding citizen. Obviously there must have been a really good reason for him to be racist. Thus the movie ends up attacking its own anti-racist sentiment.<br/><br/>Conflicts involving racism abound in this movie. But at the end everyone cries and hugs, the snow falls down because of course it happens to be around Christmas time, and you know everything is going to be okay. As an anti-racist movie, ""Crash"" takes an overtly simplistic view of racism and in the end, as many have noted, has no real message at all. Its high rating on here must be due to the fact that people like to show how much they hate racism, especially if it requires little real effort.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie is an amazing song by Bird York, ""In the Deep."" Perhaps that song confused people into thinking this was a good movie. Although not normally a fan of pop music I own Bird York's CD, and the rest of it is also lovely. Bird York's voice is sublime. But ""Crash"" is really not."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","5","11","16 November 2007"," Flawed but Watchable
","Crash is a brief exploration of racism, prejudice, coincidence, cause and effect, action reaction and latent fear. Though the situations seem exaggerated, most work well in the screenplay. The film doesn't necessarily need to be a real portrayal of racism in America but it's more Haggis's perspective on the subject that raises the question whether racial stereotype exist in every human being. The title itself is a metaphoric representation of the percussion caused by the characters' stereotype and latent fear. Due to the fact that this comment contains spoilers, I'd recommend those who haven't seen the film to stop reading further for now as the film has some interesting twists that are best watched without expectations.<br/><br/>Set over a 2-day period in a Los Angelos, 'Crash' tells the story of a bunch of LA dwellers who's lives unexpectedly 'collide'. As the film proceeds towards the end, we see each of the characters going through a transformation. In a twist of events, we see the racist cop saving the black woman whom he sexually molested and the 'good' cop killing the black guy.<br/><br/>While I had mentioned that most of the exaggerated situations work well for the screenplay, many others seem contrived. Therefore I can, to an extent, understand why to some people 'Crash' felt like a forced in-your-face message about racism. I don't see the necessity of so many subplots. If Haggis was trying to include characters of every single race, then he's missed out a few. The reason why I mention it is because at times it appears though as if in he wanted to tell something about all the different races in America and as a consequence, some subplots seem forced e.g. the Chinese man and the illegal immigrants. Some editing could have been used and some scenes required fine tuning.<br/><br/>The impressive cinematography balance the mood of the situations and characters. The closeups provide a deeper look into the characters psyche through the actors' facial expressions and body language. The soundtrack provides further support. The daytime and the nighttime brilliantly contrast with one another.<br/><br/>Dialogues are most of the time strong and they make the scenes effectively stand out. In one scene Dillon tells Phillipe 'You're not who you think you are' which is later reflected in Phillipe's character's action and in another wonderful scene Bullock tells her friend about her discovery of the root of her problems which didn't had nothing to do with the carjack trauma. Then there's another brilliant scene outside the television studio that had an impactive dialogue between Thandie Newton and Terence Howard. However, some of the talk appear very pretentious and...forced (excuse me for using this word so many times). 'Crash' lacks subtleness. Everything is loud and in your face.<br/><br/>'Crash' boasts of a marvelous ensemble cast that includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Bahar Soomekh, Brendan Fraser, Chris Bridges, Loretta Devine, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe, Brendan Fraser and Terence Howard. Most of the actors perform excellently. However, even though a majority of the characters are reasonably well written as flawed human beings (which is one of the things I liked), a few appear one dimensional and underdeveloped. For example, it could be argued that the Iranian store owner seems like a caricature that supports the stereotype about Middle Easterners being rash decision makers. 'Crash' lacks subtleness. Everything is loud and in your face.<br/><br/>The flaws were more apparent to me during my second viewing, yet, in spite of it all, 'Crash' still is watchable. I don't think Haggis was depicting racism to exist in every single human being but perhaps his intention was more to show how people have certain stereotypes that make them think a certain way. If everybody in real life really was like the characters in 'Crash' then we're all in deep *beep* but i don't think Haggis's intention was to portray this or otherwise."

","Good pacing. Smart AND intelligent. Stark with some successful attempts at subtlety. It's very real but I couldn't shake away the feeling that it's all contrived. Not recommended for people who want tightly packaged stories with actual ""endings"". Well done loose ends, and I mean that in a positive tone. Not recommended for people at risk for Don Cheadle overdose. Brendan Fraser has come a very long way from George of the Jungle.<br/><br/>Characterization of a group of individuals is always difficult in a movie. Shallow projects are your sterile, inhuman or superhero films like The Brady Bunch, X-men, LXG, Hellboy and don't forget Captain Planet & The Planeteers. Although, I enjoyed The Addams Family & Values immensely. At worst, everyone is stereotyped. This happens in cheap horror flicks especially annoying in the comedy-horror-teenage genre, and absolutely abhorring in spoof trash.<br/><br/>BUT.<br/><br/>When effort is placed in the details, when actors don't act like stars and when directors differentiate between reality and commercialism, when a movie is done with just the right amount of human depth, a drizzling of contradiction, a dash of irony and a wide spectrum of attitude... you get a very intellectually stimulating slice of life in less than 2 hours of technology-mediated performance art. The good ones are Identity, The Usual Suspects, St. Elmo's Fire, and a surprising Brit film Love Actually.<br/><br/>Crash makes the list. It makes very strong statements about people that leave you tired. It shows you different personalities who clash and yet the movie effectively breaks away from tradition and allows the audience to identify with any single person in the movie. It is all so complicated. Just like in real life. Everyone has different roles to play. I am both protagonist and antagonist, both victim and guilty. I am a friend, a stranger, a relative, a customer, a significant other, and everything else in between. The movie shows everyone isn't all bad or all good. At some point in your life, you have to choose between good and better, between bad and worse, between instinct and emotion, between pride and more pride, between who you want to be and who you think you are. In the end, the insanely circular mystery that gets me is that even though each individual is different, we are all still human... and though we may all have the same needs, what we do to fulfill those needs are the things that make life so exciting.<br/><br/>Race-related themes bore me, but Crash goes beyond racism. It's not about race, it's about CONFLICT. And, the main reason why most conflicts end ugly is that we let our emotions settle them. I am not saying we should ignore or stop our emotions, no. I think that we should go beyond our instincts, acknowledge our feelings and work on our common goals. The beauty of the film is that it does not draw the line between good and evil. In fact, it removes the concept of these two poles and paints society in indistinct hues with dynamic contrasts. When do you lose your dignity? How can you compromise your values? Do you ever really know what you are capable of doing until you do them? Too many questions, even more possible answers. I can't wait to discuss this movie with someone who's been there, done that and is wanting for more."

","Spoiler is minimal, just briefly describing character transformation properties.<br/><br/>Some cute parts n' all and I do think it had its moments, but, and don't pretend that you ALL haven't had this same exact gut feeling when watching this: I've seen this movie 500 times, including the day that it first came out -- the SAME DAY THE THEATERS WERE INVENTED!!! Even descriptions of this movie use the iconic ""the"" precept to characters, indicative of the famous ""here we go again"" characters (think ""the old"" ....): ""the"" old distracted DA, ""the"" old good black cop with ""the"" old wayward black thug son (brother), ""the"" old racist veteran cop and ""THE"" OLD IDEALISTIC YOUNG PARTNER (that's my ""favorite""). Dialogue (paraphrasing): ""You don't KNOW what it's like yet MAN. When you get out there, you'll see MAN, it's BLACKS, they're BAD, I'm telling you MAN. You'll see. You'll think like I do."" Meanwhile, Dillon's character goes from deep seeded racist to french lover of the black people in one split second upon his realization that ""black people can be in a life or death situation"" as well as white people. That's it. He's a racist a-hole turned Mother Theresa upon seeing a black woman in a car accident.<br/><br/>Now do I think the movie made some good points? Yes. And I don't mind hearing good racist points from time to time, EVEN if they're not NOVEL, but how can this movie be so. The whole perpetrated unique-dom of this movie's slant on racism is based on the ""locksmith"" character (just a poor honest Mexican guy, just trying to make a poor buck, yeah so he has gang warfare tattoos that make him look like Gacy, but the poor SOB is just misunderstood, he really sings nursery rhymes to his kids. THAT'S who he REALLY is). That's supposedly the character mis-notion that has precepted the movie. So basically, the ""original"" take on racism in this movie is that racism has many of its roots in injust and/or rash stereotypes... Will someone remind me what the old take was again??"

This film is seriously sad, so many sad moments and is very comparable to Traffic, the only difference is this topic is about Racism, not just to African-Americans, but to Oriental people and White people and all colors. If you see a man on the street and he has needles coming out of his beard and he has blonde cornrows. and he walks up to you and he's a doctor and soft-spoken guy, then you judged him wrong and that's what Crash is all about. Never judge someone simply by looking at them. You don't see a movie half the time you're watching this movie. It's very believable.<br/><br/>Actually, the entire cast was believable. Great cameos by Keith David, Tony Danza, and Daniel Dae Kim. This is one of those movies that you can't get enough of, this music is very sad for it's moments. The music is awesome.

Michael Pena as Daniel, the locksmith and his daughter(everyone seems to pre-judge him.) In my opinion, all the story lines were awesome and simply powerful as hell. Definitely worth a look.<br/><br/>You must pay attention, though to actually understand it.

"benier","4","9","24","12 May 2005"," Haggis: Playing With Fire and Not Getting Burned ...
","All of the characters were underdeveloped as they served as willing pawns in this Maalox yarn. Jewish actor, Brendan Fraser affects a wonderful WASPy posture as a politically sensitive District Attorney. Yet he is ultimately forgettable. Sandra Bullock, as his wife, was one sexy >bleep<!  But she should've been secretly half black or something to make her obnoxious character more relevant. Her behavior was just not genuinely racist. Bullock's character was just one Sexy-Ass Bitch ... but an Ass nonetheless. Of course, she wasn't that sexy when she fell down that flight of stairs. <br/><br/>The film is littered with cheap devices used by the director to skirt real issues of racism. There is substantial emotional impact scattered about  but it uneven, sometimes heavy- handed, most times humorous. The only REAL racism is, interestingly, woven into the screenplay itself. All the missed cultural-cues and fragile, artificial dialogue amount to a parched-mouth mea culpa by the writer. There's your first dose of real irony. <br/><br/>For all the melodrama in the young street hood characters (played with skepticism by Larenz Tate and rap star Ludicrous) their dialogue obsequiously panders to white, racist expectations. Moreover, they were far too intellectual and self-analyzing of their predicament to be credible street people. The dialogue was callow and leading, as to camouflage the authors mal-informed dialectics. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle leads a motley crew of great actors who were obviously lead down a primrose path: Jewish actors Shaun Toub and Bahar Soomekh work in vein to hold the messy ""Persian/ Arab"" sub-story together. Far too complex to begin to comment on. But it was obviously a contrived element designed to capitalize on the current American/Anglo fascination and (fear of) with the Middle East. <br/><br/>With Daniel (Michael Pena) and his bulletproof daughter, I think the author is suggesting that racism (even) happens between minorities! (A classic, white rationalization stratagem) A Chinese wife of a draggled man calls a random white nurse a cow. Was the nurse a shill for the director's paean of white guilt? Does insulting white people punish them for being racists? Is 80s-style white self-punishment coming back in vogue? Ryan Philippe's character was laughable. After he accidentally kills his would-be black buddy he torches his car and starts a bonfire of the vanities. The ashes disperse and in a desperate nod to PT Anderson (a filmmaker with really strong talent), suddenly it's snowing in Los Angeles. <br/><br/>Matt Dillon's character got the greatest pass of the movie. He had the luxury of being a complete and overt racist. After he brazenly fondles a black woman, (Thandie Newton) humiliating her before her husband (a great acting effort, expended by the great Terrance Howard  but his character is ridiculously written); he gets to be the biggest hero as he pulls her from a burning SUV (a situation that could only possibly overlap in a small town like Mayberry). In this drippy, melodramatic scene Matt Dillon dives back into the exploding vehicle to save Ms. Newton's embattled character from certain death. The moment becomes strangely erotic. The same way I imagine Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemming were erotic  nothing like being raped by your oppressor! After about a hundred years or so, you might learn to actually like it  <br/><br/>Is Mr. Haggis suggesting as Warren Beatty suggested in his 1994 farce, Bulworth: that racist whites can find redemption in mating with black people? Or is this the ultimate form of ethnic cleansing? It certainly was for hundreds of years during western European slavery. It is a compelling argument to state that we are currently smack-in-the-middle of the same racist regime! Our present time reality makes the surrealism of Alice in Wonderland pale by comparison. The fact that we can actually make entertainment products that decry our predicament is probably the secret that will make this film financially successful. Irony thick as blood. <br/><br/>In the future, after the dust has cleared from the fallout of our modern Babylon state, this movie will be seen as a propaganda film. Haggis is manipulating everyone. At first I was going to make an effort to seriously deconstruct the film but now I realize its just cultural manipulation, pure and simple. Haggis has taken a leadership position as he abrogates the effects of white racism. Indeed, racism as we understand it in America was fueled by European colonization and nothing other. It's an entirely fair indictment of our European forbearers. Indeed, fixing the blame does not have to constitute hating white people or any oppressor in the context of Tyranny. Modern ""racism"" as we know it today, is a mere orphan of race-tyranny. <br/><br/>Well, at least Mr. Haggis as sparked a conversation. But like the infamously popular academic text, The Bell Curve, over a decade ago -- which also sparked a national dialogue on race issues, albeit supported by soft-science on the academic front -- it is a dubious distinction of false merit. Paul haggis has confessed his racism to the world and he's getting paid handsomely for it. And that reality is the greatest irony of all."

","""Racist people are bad, but I'm not racist, so I'm not part of the problem."" That is the feeling you are supposed to have when you finish watching Crash. I don't know if a movie could possibly have a more harmful message than that.<br/><br/>Crash tells the story of many characters of different ethnic backgrounds who live in LA. Their lives all come together at different points and they learn about racism.<br/><br/>Each character has a bizarre and undeveloped hatred of a racial group. Sandra Bullock's character hates black men. Ludicrous's character hates Asian people. Don Cheadle hates Latino people (but is inexplicably dating a Latina woman?). Why do these people hate these groups? Hell if I know. The movie just sort of assumes that average people are extremely racist for no reason.<br/><br/>The audience cannot connect to any character in the movie because every character is extremely and cartoonishly racist. As soon as you think a character is reasonable, they go and say something outlandishly racist and you have to dislike them. This is by design. If a viewer sees 10 characters in a movie who are all racist, the viewer thinks ""I'm special because I'm not racist like them."" This is meant to make the audience feel good about themselves. With a Best Picture win from the Academy, obviously this strategy worked.<br/><br/>Racism is not a black and white phenomenon, there is a lot of gray area. Every person operates with subtle racial biases in their day-to-day lives. A movie like 2017's Get Out depicts this form of ""casual racism."" Some people are more than just casually racist, and that racism usually stems from something about their background- maybe they were raised in a town where racism was accepted, maybe they had a bad experience with a person of a specific racial group and have since projected that onto an entire ethnic group. The point is that the racism depicted in the movie is unrealistic and harmful to show to audiences, since people will believe it.<br/><br/>This movie almost serves as a ""field guide"" for racist catchphrases. Characters hurl disgustingly racist insults at each other constantly throughout the movie. A person who hopes to use racism to put somebody else down now has this entire movie as an example for funny and clever racist sayings. The actors are given such over-the-top intensely racist dialogue and it is all played in such an overdramatic and serious way that the audience can't help but cringe and feel secondhand embarrassment while watching the movie.<br/><br/>The ""cathartic"" ending to the movie was actually disgusting. Sandra Bullock like sprains her foot and her black maid drives her to the hospital so she has an epiphany and doesn't hate black people anymore. I'm not even joking that actually happens. All the other characters have similar ""epiphany"" moments so none of them are racist anymore. Portraying racism as a simple thing that can be cured just like that is mind-bogglingly stupid. Racial biases don't just go away, and it's shamefully incorrect to imply that. If racism was easily cured, then it wouldn't be an issue.<br/><br/>As I struggle to think of positives about the movie, I have to mention that Ludicrous's acting was actually very good in this movie. He's primarily a musician but he elevated the script really well and had a lot of charisma in his few scenes. I don't know much about his acting career, but he certainly impressed me. Another positive is the cinematography. There are a lot of cool-looking shots with a dynamic camera that is always tracking. There are also a lot of stylish transitions which look nice.<br/><br/>In total, Crash isn't just unworthy of its Academy Awards, it's actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is smug, overdramatic, and actually more harmful than good in spreading its anti-racist message. Don't watch this movie."
"Dorjee_Wang","6","2","3","6 March 2016"," A compelling disappointment
","Crash is infamous for winning the coveted Academy Award for Best Picture over the much more loved Brokeback Mountain. While it took me more than a decade to actually watch this movie, I more or less could understand where the outrage came from.<br/><br/>The movie features a handful of character all living in Los Angeles, whose lives seems entangled. While it follows an overarched plot, everyone character is given their own story. Thematically it explores the topics of xenophobia especially racism and communalism. While the concept is a compelling one, the movie struggles throughout to make it stand because it's full of stereotypes, desperate dialogues & perverted meaning. The plot development is sluggish, while the character struggles to make the story stand, for e.g the case of the Persain shopkeeper (played by Shaun Toub) who is unbearably sensitive (especially showcased during his interaction with Michael Pena's character) was an ill attempt at making the point, and honestly the movie could have done without his superfluous presence. The racial dialogues all seemed forced and unrealistic, and all the ""racist"" characters seemed to be hellbent on making the point of ""people are racist!"", which made the movie a very unrealistic and cynical view of life. There's one scene in the movie where a minor character tells Terrance Howard's character that a Black character is becoming a lot ""less black"" just because he said ""Don't talk to me about that"" instead of ""Don't be talking' 'about that"". That is just pushing the boundaries of atrocious desperate writing, convolutes the meaning of the whole movie and insults the intelligence of the viewers. While the first act of the movie struggles, the 2nd isn't any better either. The characters are more or less given a second chance in the second half, but again it's attempted through a very weak writing and scattered scenes which just fails to make much of an impact. Although arguably the best scene in the movie comes near the end where Ryan and Tate's character relays that people of different races are not any different from each other.<br/><br/>While the writing disappoints, the acting is a lot better. And it's the main reason I even gave this movie a star. Sandra Bullock plays a disillusioned housewife convincingly, while Thandie Newton sells the black woman hurt by her husband's refusal to defend her. But there are some very subpar performances as well. Brandon Fraser's character is forgettable, and the other actors besides Don Cheaddle and Ryan Philippe are more or less forgettable as well and midway through the movie you'll just stop caring about them.<br/><br/>As a caveat, I'll say the movie is unconvincing, casts off characters as stereotypes and is filled with scattered scenes which fails to make an impact. I'd not recommend it to anyone, the only positive thing I can say is that the few of the actors acted well."

","The promise of 'Crash' makes its outlook very compelling, good cast in a movie about inter-twining lives against the backdrop of a big city and all its problems. However this film is nowhere near as powerful or brilliant as '21 Grams' which followed a similar concept but was perfectly executed. With 'Crash' we have a movie which deals with racism but each character is so stereo-typical who makes decisions we all expect them to make that the whole story becomes predictable and at times boring. The performances are good, which is not surprising when you assemble a top cast but the movie is dis-jointed and none of the characters are such that you would really care about what they do or what happens to them. There prejudices which are all based on racism are too blatant and their turnaround farcical. It would have been much more interesting if the movie had at least some characters who have sub-conscious prejudices which surface in a particular situation, this is a lot more common than the characters shown in this movie.

","This 2005 Best Picture-winning, West Coast ""Do The Right Thing,"" is a Disney-fied, unfunny attempt to expose our collective prejudices. Unlike the 1989 Spike Lee joint, it superficially places the harbored racist stream-of-consciousness of its characters on their sleeves. Of course there are people like this in real life; the pampered politician's wife (played by Sandra Bullock) who doesn't trust the tattooed Latino locksmith (Michael Pena), who is really a respectable, hard-working, God-fearing Dad. It's not that a situation like that doesn't occur in real life, but it is the hyperbolic way that it is presented that falls flat. There isn't very much depth to the characters. They all play these racist caricatures or victimized caricatures that serve as vehicles for monologues that the author wants to express, which is the cycle of racism and glass house-stone throwing culture of America that we live in. For example, the black insurance lady who had to sit through Cop Matt Dillon's racial tirade only to espouse her own stereotypes toward a fellow Asian motorist in a later scene. Almost every character does this and it just becomes predictable. Seriously, Spike Lee did this fifteen years prior with the infamous race-based soliloquies in Do The Right Thing, and it was not only effective, it was funny. Crash simply does not deliver.<br/><br/>The ensemble of brilliant actors and solid performances couldn't pull this textbook ""Wild LA"" script from the burning wreck of its own conclusion. It was certainly watch-able for the performances alone, and I will say that some of the key plot twists were creative and well-placed. Which is why I won't trash it. It is a good movie in a technical sense but it certainly is not an Oscar-winner in my book. If the point of this story is redemption, then it did not succeed in conveying that. Especially with Matt Dillon's character. I don't believe that his actions in the film were redemptive. Fate can't bail out your guilt."
"brchthethird","4","2","3","6 March 2015"," Overly simplistic and heavy-handed
","While CRASH is most assuredly a technically well-made film, there is absolutely nothing it has to say that couldn't be ascertained from paying a little attention in the real world. Racism is definitely a problem in America (and the world), but all this film seems to have to contribute to that discussion is that it's bad. To make matters worse, every single character in the film is a stereotype. And there's also too many characters to begin with. You learn a little bit about them and their lives, but the running time didn't really allow for a deeper examination of these people and why they are the way they are. All of the performances were good, to be sure, but it was all in service of a heavy-handed script that approaches the issue of racism in the most skin-deep way possible. Despite the film's title, implying a certain degree of chance in one's encounters, every moment in the film felt calculated and calibrated for maximum emotional impact in a way that undermines the seriousness of the issues it wanted to address. At the end, no one really learns anything and, as an audience member, I was left wondering what the point was exactly. From a technical standpoint, though, the film is fairly solid. The movie is about, and (presumably) shot in, LA and the filmmakers did a good job of capturing it on film, especially in the night time. The cinematography was actually kind of beautiful, in contrast to the ugliness of the characters. I'll even give credit to the score for being relatively toned down, letting the rigged emotional stakes of the film stand out that much more. When all is said and done, I'm also left wondering how in the world this shallow nonsense ever won Best Picture. Although well-made and well-acted, it just seems like the Academy gave themselves a pat on the back for even acknowledging that racism exists. The subject deserves better and more thorough treatment than it got with this film."

","These type of movies that follow multiple different story lines and characters simultaneously can work out great but I don't really see this movie as a good and successful example of the genre.<br/><br/>Problem really is with its story. You could say that the movie is commenting on racism but to me it more was a movie about stupid people, doing stupid things, no matter what their ethnicity is. It besides tries to do and tell too much, in a too short amount of time, with as a result that the ending of the movie feels rushed and totally unsatisfying. Seriously, how are exactly all of the story lines resolved at the end? And how are some of the characters redeemed? The movie leaves an incredible amount of loose ends, with both its story lines and characters. In this particular case I wouldn't had minded seeing this movie being about one hour longer.<br/><br/>Most of the actions by all of the characters are besides some very unlikely ones. The movie does a poor job, building up to certain things and not all of the character's actions are explained well enough or make much sense. Sometimes stuff just happens, to add to the overall drama of the movie. It lets the movie feel forced instead of realistic, while this obviously still was the approach that the film-makers were aiming for.<br/><br/>It's not like I'm hating the movie but just too many things about it failed to work out to let me see this as a great or successful movie, at what it tried to achieve. It still remains a watchable enough little movie, also since it's never boring and always on the move. There is plenty happening, though not everything got handled equally great or interesting enough.<br/><br/>You could of course also still watch it for its acting. It has an all star cast in it, with maybe not the biggest names but still some well known and respected actors in it. Some of them impress, while others get pushed to the background too easily. I particularly liked Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle in their roles, while Sandra Bullock for instance got pushed way too much to the background.<br/><br/>Something that I thought was absolutely dreadful about the movie was its musical score by Mark Isham. It totally didn't suited the movie and was even kind of distracting at times.<br/><br/>Not a great movie and it even somewhat annoyed me with the way it was handling some of its developments and characters but it still remains far from a horrible movie as well and is actually still pretty watchable.

","Crash (2004) is set in Los Angeles and follows the lives of several different and seemingly unconnected characters over a 48 hour period. Among them are a District Attorney Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife, Jean, LAPD officer Waters (Don Cheadle) who is estranged from his mother, a racist LAPD officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his young, idealist partner, officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe), and a director, Cameron Thayer (Terrance Howard) and his wife, Christine (Thandie Newton).<br/><br/>The main themes in the movie are that everyone is racist to a certain degree, and that there is good and bad in each of us. The film explores these motifs within each character arc. The movie opens with a scene at a car accident involving the Thayer's. Officer Ryan gets out of his patrol car to investigate the incident, and when Christine becomes argumentative after Ryan orders the couple out of the car, the angry Ryan molests Christine under the guise of a pat down. Cameron witnesses his wife's violation but says nothing. Christine is angry with Cameron because he didn't stand up to the white officer and defend her. Toward the end of the movie, Christine is involved in another, more serious car accident and becomes trapped inside her vehicle. Officer Ryan again responds to the scene and finds that the woman he molested the day before is the woman who is trapped. Christine screams for Ryan to go away, but Ryan is able to convince her to allow his help. This story line displays both central motifs and the dialogue in the film is the central vehicle used to carry the theme.<br/><br/>The theme in Crash is similar to the theme for the movie American History X. Each movie revolves around racial prejudice, though the racism is more extreme and in your face in American History X. And in both movies, some of the central characters find a degree of redemption by finding the good in themselves. In Crash, I think one of the moments of redemption was the scene with Jean and her housekeeper, Maria after Jean's fall. Throughout the movie, Jean has been angry, bitter, and extremely prejudice against the characters that were not white. Just before the fall, Jean attempts to reach out to a friend for help and is turned away. After the fall, Maria, who has been the recipient of Jean's cruelty, is the only one willing to help. Jean realizes that the woman whom she has treated so badly is the only friend she has. I think this scene is meant to be a turning point for Jean and that with her realization she will begin to reevaluate how she treats others. Every action has a reaction, and by the end of the film, each character had witnessed the damage their racist behavior had caused."

Crash is focused on playing the ""Race card"", and if you ask me the biggest problem about this movie is I think it was very overplayed in some scenes. In a couple scenes they take the things way to far out of proportion. This movie has that type of up close filming that is in your face and meant to be dramatic and intense. The only thing wrong with this is that the used it thought-out the whole movie, and when the intense scenes did come along this filming method did not have the full effect.

","Another film on the quest for the 2005 Oscar's badge. ""Crash"" was a controversial choice for Best Picture at the time beating the heavily favoured ""Brokeback Mountain"". Since then ""Crash"" stock has increasingly fallen and is regularly ranked as one of the worst films to have won the Best Picture Oscar. If I'm honest, I can see why.<br/><br/>Exploring the race relations of Los Angeles over a three day period. ""Crash"" centres of various exchanges between amongst others, a racist cop Ryan (Matt Dillion) and his interactions with TV Director Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton). Elsewhere, a District attorney (Brendon Fraser) tried to appear on the side of law and order, whilst simultaneously keeping the black community on his side. Meanwhile, Persian Immigrant Farhad (Shaun Toub) purchases a gun to help protect his store from robbers.<br/><br/>The trouble with the film is, despite I think generally trying to do good and explore prejudices that exist it's just so heavy handed in its approach. Several times characters literally monologue about their feelings on race relations in such a way that nobody speaks or has conversations in real life. The story is actually reasonably clever, as the vignettes crossover and some of the reveals that come later in the film are pretty good but I'm not sure any of the character arcs actually earn the redemption the film acts like they do, particularly Matt Dillon's character.<br/><br/>The performances are, as you might expect from the wealth of talent involved, really good. It did make me wonder why Chris Bridges doesn't do more serious acting, or at least be given more to do in the ""Fast and Furious"" movies, because he's excellent here. But on a technical level the film isn't particularly well made, perhaps because Paul Haggis is a much better writer than he is a director. Shot composition is amateurish and the music selections are jarring. There is a moment towards the end of the film that is supposed to be the emotional gut punch, which is hilariously undermined by a zoom on Michael Pena's face.<br/><br/>As I said, I think at its heart the film is trying to do good and stimulate the conversation but the race situation around the world is too important to award points, and Oscars, for effort."

It's not realistic though, because most people in LA don't think in race every time they take a walk outside, I would say.

","""Crash"" is a superbly made film. The actors are first rate, the camera style is engaging, and production value is tops. And despite all this, I would never recommend it to anyone. Why? I'll explain in my 4th paragraph but first let's talk about the story.<br/><br/>This film follows the lives of a dozen or so people over the course of 2 days all living in Los Angeles. The opening scene gives us the aftermath of some ambiguous tragedy (the titular ""crash""), and the next scene flashes back to ""yesterday"" and shows us the events in these people's seemingly unrelated lives, leading up to that opening moment. If you've seen ""House of Sand and Fog"" (the #1 Feel Bad Movie of the 2000s), you'll recognize an identical sort of chronology and foreboding tone--so similar that I wonder if the Crash filmmakers were somehow involved in House as well. Both films are very powerful and effective at what they aim to do, and that is, simply put, to disturb us.<br/><br/>Disturb us it does. Within the first 15 minutes, we see things that are so disturbing to the pit of our souls that I almost shut the movie off twice. Racism, hate, justified racism, justified hate, brutal stereotypes. The film masterfully shows us not only the worst quality of humankind but it scrutinizes the reasons why humans are this way. There's no good guy/bad guy; it's all bad guys. The first 15 mins is designed to make us hate almost every character, if not every race. By showing the atrocity that each race supposedly inflicts on the other, it paints us a Hatfield-McCoy cycle of hatred that has no known origin. It just exists and burns hotter. Non-whites are subverted by white society, so they exact revenge by committing crimes against white people which in turn causes the white police to hate and abuse non-white people who in turn become criminals against white people. The cycle of hate is not only explained but validated in a well-crafted, brutally told, highly disturbing way.<br/><br/>Which leads me to the 4th paragraph where I explain why I would never recommend this film. It's because IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL BAD. For nearly 2 hours you get the same feeling you get when you watch too much cable news. And just as psychologists warn that watching too much news leads to depression, I would say the same can be said of films like this which, like the news, expose and scrutinize the absolute worst of humanity.<br/><br/>But then one might say that films like this are necessary to inspire change. Normally I would agree, and I'm sure that that's the intent of the filmmakers here. But let me ask you: who needs to change? Answer: racists and bigots. But are racists and bigots really going to be watching ""Crash"", stroking their beards and saying ""Golly, I need to stop being a racist""? Probably not. And that is the film's undoing. By taking a heavy, ponderous, complex look at racism and hate, it alienates the fury-driven haters who most need to grasp this message. And instead ""Crash"" merely preaches to the choir, making the choir feel gawd awful lousy about the state of the world.<br/><br/>The film attempts to lead us to redemption, and there is at least 1 truly powerful scene of triumph that's worth the price of admission. However, other subplot resolutions seem a bit contrived, if not completely unnecessary, such as one character's climactic tragedy & epiphany which was so random I literally burst out laughing (the moral of the story being: don't wear socks indoors!). Ultimately ""Crash"" tries to tie things up neatly with a positive message, but it's precisely this neat tie-up, simultaneously with every sub-plot, that feels a bit contrived and ultimately unbelievable. At the risk of cutting out half the award-winning cast, perhaps the film should have focused on just 1 story & resolution, rather than pulling the ""Fantasy Island"" formula of having half a dozen stories wrap up neatly in the last 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Ultimately, despite its excellent presentation and first class acting, ""Crash"" couldn't sell me on its optimistic spin and instead left me feeling pretty horrible about the reality of living in a world where racists don't often have magical transformations. If you understand what I'm saying, you might want to skip this flick because, regardless of how it ends, the subject will just make you feel bad."

","""Munich"", ""Capote"", ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and the favorite ""Brokeback Mountain"" were all great and daring movies but they never challenged cinematic conventions the way Paul Haggis' passion-project did. His ""Crash"" defies tropes and genres not in a politically but also socially incorrect way, through interlocking stories all set in the canvas of a post-September 11 Los Angeles. I had said about Cassavetes' ""Faces"" that it felt like a slap in our faces, ""Crash"" doesn't just slap, it literally crashes reality into our faces.<br/><br/>The title gives you the right idea by using the metaphor of the car, it is introduced by Don Cheadle's monologue about people needing a crash sometimes to get a sense of touch, to forget how remote they are one to another. This is the same L.A. Tom Cruise had just panned the same year in ""Collateral"", a town of cold selfishness where cars eventually play a pivotal role in the way they make various intrusion possible, not all of them are providential of course. Indeed, either for a carjacking, a ride, a police control or a rescue, every action has its consequences, some tragic, some inspiring, some driven by the best intentions yet causing unfortunate collateral damages, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Collateral, that word again. Not every intrusion has a cause or serve a point, most of them are accidental yet they have an effect, and the way each effect seems to make some statement about our humanity is a credit to the triumphant intelligence of Haggis' script. And since I don't want to spoil the film, I will only focus on one character, Matt Dillon as a LAPD officer. This is a man whose establishing moment consists on humiliating a black couple (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton) during a control. In any lesser movie, such a despicable character would get a Karmic revenge. ""Crash"" ironically makes him the most human. It all works by contrast, most characters dodge prejudices or racism while having them printed in their subconscious, Dillon's character doesn't cheat with his views.<br/><br/>And that's ""Crash"" power, it dares to challenge our perceptions of the ugliest symptoms of prejudice by showing us how deeply rooted they are in reality and experience, it's not beautiful but at least it's real. A rich white woman (Sandra Bullock) acts scared when crossing the path of two black kids on the pavement, what happens next actually proves her right and she even uses it as an ""I told you"" argument to her husband (Brendan Fraser). Yet one of the carjackers is clearly not as ethically challenged as his partner and in the end, he's hitchhiked by Dillon's rookie police partner (Ryan Philippe) who was shocked by his colleagues' behavior and asked for a new assignment. What emerges from that encounter serves a painful but valuable lesson to anyone who believes his conscience is cleaner than everyone else's.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""Crash"" isn't about feelings, intentions or motives but plain actions, and reactions that translate themselves into action, and car crashes are the right metaphors for these revealing moments in our lives when we stop being trapped by our inhibitions. Consequently, so many brutal things happen that we might miss the little touches. Take the locksmith (Michael Pena), he's mistaken for a thug by both the rich white woman and the Iranian man who was insulted by a gun store owner who must have taken for an Arab. Yet Pena plays the least troublemaking character in the film, but even he isn't immune to danger or violent misunderstanding.<br/><br/>The film isn't all dark and gritty and there a a few guardian angels here and there, which is appropriate in Los Angeles, but so many devilish vibes poison relationships between people who have so much in common. The Persian man is obviously worn-down by all the prejudice he might have suffered from and the irony is that it made him more unstable and threatening. Another irony is that some black characters use racism as an excuse to act no better than the oppressors they accuse. The film is full of ironies where people become attackers in the name of victimhood. And that did remind me of another urban drama classic.<br/><br/>In a way, ""Crash"" plays out like a ""Do The Right Thing"" for the 2000s, with people doing the thing they think is right, allowing tragedy to burst out the most random and anticlimactic moments. In fact, it's not about doing the right or the bad thing, but the fact that some people we know to be good can commit reprehensible acts, and then you have Dillon's character first depicted as a hateful cop first but then a caring son to his ill father and a hero, this speaks a thousand words, and dig a thousand truths, many of them quite inconvenient for our mentalities.<br/><br/>Yes, today, we live in a world or a culture of plain victimization, it's all about white vs. minorities, women vs. men etc. and the problem with ""Crash"" is that it was set at a time where there was no smart phone, where most of these things wouldn't happen without someone immediately denouncing it, which is good in theory but who knows how disastrous the consequences can be when everything is shown in a binary black-or-white way. No need to get further; if there ever is one thing ""Crash"" shows is that the accused ones can be victims and victims aren't always innocent.<br/><br/>We all have public faces and backgrounds, some aspects of us are known, others are not, but we also don't know the real content of our characters until we're confronted to the most extreme situations like crashes or similar car encounters. ""Crash"" is mostly about people learning about themselves, to be better. Today's world is too binary and obtuse, even accusing ""Crash"" of being manipulative, and while I'm wondering how we could take so many step back, I'll always consider the film a humanistic masterpiece"
"arthur_tafero","8","1","1","18 November 2018"," Another Figgis Gem: Crash
","This is a second film by director Figgis that deals with the social complexities of LA. No one does it better. He takes the lives of a dozen people and connects the dots with stereotypes, class distinctions, race problems, parent-sibling problems, and even a few other minor social difficulties. He weaves these problems among the dozen or so people, similar to what he accomplished in American History X, also about social problems in a California city (Venice), without concentrating too much on any one individual character.
This ensemble-type effort has been done before in Hollywood by a handful of directors; some of them good; others bad. But it appears as if Figgis has it down to a science. His finished product is always polished, logical, and emotionally involving. Highly recommended."
"botfeeder","8","1","1","17 February 2018"," what to make of it?
","The acting was superb, the story was impeccably woven.<br/><br/>People tend to either love or hate this movie. <br/><br/>Some of the criticisms I have seen:<br/><br/>1). Lack of realism. Characters and situations not plausible. Certainly true but not necessarily strikes against the film. Extraordinary situations make for a gripping story. Implausible characters are legitimate if they serve as a path toward insight into real people. <br/><br/>2). Too formulaic. (this one I can't comprehend. Perhaps on a superficial level. I read one critic referred to something along the lines of there being a ""interwoven stories of an alienated populace in Los Angeles"" genre.<br/><br/>The most striking thing in this movie to me is the morally bipolar characters. Those characters who have a strong moral component alternately exhibit extreme good and extreme evil. None of the characters have the moral tenor of traditional dramatic characters- good guys, bad guys, bad guys with a streak of good, good guys who bend the rules, etc.<br/><br/>It doesn't seem obvious to me what this is trying to tell us about real people, but it does force us to look at people from a very different perspective than we have been taught and are accustomed to doing.<br/><br/>When I read that Ta Nehisi Coates loathed the movie, I knew that I had judged it correctly. This is not a film that will appeal to one dimensional minds."
"philipposx-12290","6","1","1","2 February 2018"," Good approach, okay implementation
","Nearly half way through the film ""LA. Crash"" misses ideas and new themes to carry itself another hour. In general, I think the idea of making a movie about race relationships and the effect on society is interesting and the movie always knows what it should be. Straightforward with much intensity and good drama and even some ""punch-in-the-gut-moments"". 
What pushes the movie for me is the fact that it willingly takes a straight up evil and bad man, and allows him to be human. Not that many movies have done that or can do that. 
The story is non linear and follows many storylines and characters to in the end culminate all these stories. In that regard, it feels pretty similar to ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), just not that funny, not that violent, not that unique and not that well-acted and directed. But, comparing a movie with Pulp Fiction is never good for the movie itself.
What ultimately prevents the movie of being more than ""solid"" is that the storylines are obvious, although often well-intentioned, the ambition is just too much to make it unpredictable or even exciting. 
The acting is good but because of the big ensemble and therefore little screen time, no character can really shine that much or put on a memorable performance. 
Maybe it is just because I have seen too many Crime/Drama flicks, that this one just didn't fully connect with me and frankly comparing ""LA. Crash"" to movies like ""The Godfather"" (1972) or ""GoodFellas"" (1990) would be a comprehensive stretch. 6/10"
"redshoesfall","7","1","1","25 July 2017"," Still Entertaining... Aside from the Dialogue
","All in all, I actually enjoyed the film for what it was: it thrilling. Not to say it was a thriller, but there are points in which are incredibly intense and entertaining, and I'd say a watch is worth it for that.<br/><br/>Obviously, the film has some major flaws: just by reading the script, one could say that the film is a little full of itself. Maybe a lot. <br/><br/>The film begins with Don Cheadle talking off like it's poetry night, when in actually he's a detective in LA. A normal dude, right? ""All this meddlin' glass...""<br/><br/>That's to say that in the least, the dialogue takes itself too seriously, trying too hard to make a point. The stronger points of the film are when the characters aren't saying anything.<br/><br/>The actions and the subject of racism in the film work to the extent of it's viewer's capability of taking these in stride. When I first watch the movie, I went in totally cold - it was more than a decade it was made and I had no idea what it was about.<br/><br/>The first couple of minutes, I got it. Racism is bad. Job done - but they keep dragging it out when I think it handled the subject best when it was just the characters living their lives with their worries, discomforts, and obstacles. This film is incredibly contrived.<br/><br/>Yet, I can't help but recommend it for some viewers, at least those who can stand/look past the cheesy dialogue and heavy-handed message - there are parts worth watching for, at least for when I saw it. I love the soundtrack, the actors are great, and the action is actually pretty good, too. <br/><br/>I don't recommend referring to any trailers. Most of the ones I've seen only give too much away. Go into this as cold as possible."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","6 July 2017"," We all suffer from the same curse
","Crash, directed by Paul Haggis, is a collection of intertwining stories set in Los Angeles. We follow a pair of cops, for example, who in turn pull over a vehicle, the driver of which we then follow around for a while, and so on. Kind of like Pulp Fiction, but with the emphasis on theme rather than style.<br/><br/>That theme in this case being that of prejudice. These characters are victims and perpetrators of racism, bigotry and hate. Or, as the movie want you to realize, they're often both at the same time depending on the circumstances. Being a victim of racial slurs and worse doesn't keep you from throwing similar slurs around in a different setting. Those who are bullied often become bullies themselves to seize back some of the power that was taken from them. And that's a vicious cycle.<br/><br/>It's a poignant message, and what I appreciate about this film is its neutrality. It doesn't take sides, and if it condemns, it condemns us all as equals. Very few characters in this film are completely without a blame, which rings true to me as a viewer.<br/><br/>The acting is also topnotch, as it should be for a film of this substance. Matt Dillon's Academy Award nominated performance is one of the best in the film easily, though I also like Shaun Toub and Michael Peña a lot. But truly there are no bad performances in this film.<br/><br/>Crash is one of the best films about race, racism and bigotry I've seen. And it earns that through engaging storytelling, good characters and steadfast neutrality. Great watch."
"davispittman","7","1","1","24 April 2017"," Not deserving of best picture but still a good movie
","I don't think this film is a 10/10 best picture academy award winning movie, I do think it's a good movie that deserves praise for what it does right, but I think best picture is giving it a little too much than it deserves. The cast does a wonderful job with their performances. Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Michael Pena, ludicrous, Ryan Philippe, Thandie Newton, and Matt Dillon all give very deep powerful performances. Acting is what this film really gets right, it's the best thing about the movie in my opinion. This is one of those movies where it takes many different kinds of characters from completely different backgrounds and intertwines their story lines and it asks the audience to ask some pretty serious questions about heavy issues that face our society and country. The script is well written and there are only a few parts in the middle of the movie where I felt like it dragged a bit. The acting really is what keeps the audience watching, the performances are just so well done and raw. There are some scenes that really do touch you in that special way and that's good because it's meant to stir feelings. There are a couple of African American male characters at the beginning and the one played by ludicrous is talking about racial profiling and discrimination and then they do something that is completely stupid and self destructive and truthfully embarrassing for the African American community. So that kinda ticked me off, and then you have a white rich couple who lets just say aren't the nicest people ever, even though you do come to sympathize with the woman (Sandra Bullock). And you have other characters that face Islamaphobia, racial stereotyping, and family issues. The movie for the most part does a good job with dealing with these tough issues. I wanted the film to be a little more shaking and remarkable than it was. It was shaking in a lot of ways, but I personally just don't feel like this one was best picture material. Maybe a nominee, but not a winner. 7/10."
"joefhaddad-680-7471","6","1","1","21 December 2016"," An Excellent Cast for an Uneven and Over-Dramatic Movie
","After watching this movie twice, there's a double frustration, first because one might wonder how such a fantastic cast came together on a picture of such questionable taste, and second because this picture shares its name with a masterpiece directed by David Cronenberg, and what are the odds of having two masterpieces with the same name? The movie tackles ever-relevant social issues, the outcome of which is fairly thought provoking. The intention is there and it's a good and smart one. Applause, again, to the players, who, despite an uneven script, are all in top from, from the principal roles like Terrence Howard's director (magnificent) and Brendan Fraser's attorney (possibly the first intelligent role of his career) to secondary characters like the objectified secretary, wonderfully played by Loretta Devine. This is a portmanteau film, meaning that it comprises several plot-lines of almost equal importance instead of the more frequent plot/sub-plots formula. Each plot-line in Crash intertwines with another one way or another. First, let's point out – and this is not a criticism – that this movie is allegedly happening in more or less 48 hours. Thus, the fact that the scenes are clocked begs a realistic depiction of events, theoretically leaving little room for poetic analysis or open interpretations. The impeccable actors are really doing their best with an overdramatic script that forces them to be equally overdramatic and, worst of all, to take their characters and situations a teeny tiny bit too seriously, the exact extra amount of seriousness to make the movie not fun to watch. Sandra Bullock spends almost the whole movie on the telephone complaining about her stolen car and her Latino maid, later opening up her heart to her frustrations during an emotional phone monologue (close-up), after which she (suddenly) falls down the stairs, in a slow-motion shot complete with Kar-Wai strobe, followed by a wide shot of her crying on the floor (in case you didn't get it, she cries due to both physical AND emotional pain). Let's also mention the catastrophic party pooper that is the Iranian's armed confrontation with the Latino locksmith. Seeking revenge over a robbery he blames him for, the Iranian guy confronts the locksmith in front of the latter's house, in broad daylight (because that's what killers do, but the shots are saturated typical Hollywood-style and, of course, are in slow-mo, so let's call it an artistic choice). They exchange very heated F words at the very second when the Latino's kid daughter jumps up to his arms and at the very second the Iranian happens to shoot after holding fire for a good minute. This is still possible in real life, it would be a horrible coincidence but still, this can happen. However, when you thought the movie couldn't possibly force more fake tears into your eyes, that's when the a cappella aerial soprano music kicks in. This is called emotional masturbation. Mind you, this is not a bad movie; this is simply a very disappointing one. And every time you try to give it a chance there's something there to distract you. The labyrinth-like links between characters are typical of portmanteau's but, in this case, the audience gets lost playing the ""That's the brother of the cousin of the woman who was in the car, not this car, the car from the scene before"" game. You also get the infamous ""it's a bitch but life goes on with funky music"" ending. Even Mrs. Doubtfire has a more ambiguous ending. Paul Haggis has proved his screen writing competence with several projects, but for this film (which is his directorial debut for the big screen) he might have wanted the script and the shot- list to help each other. Unfortunately they ended up having the opposite reaction to each other. The movie does stick together. And the fact that such a relevant subject matter is delivered by such a competent cast will keep you interested all the way through. The issue here is artistic, as the movie promises more than it delivers."

Yesterday, Persian shop owner Farhad and his daughter Dorri buy a gun. Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) talk about racism. Jean (Sandra Bullock) and husband DA Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) get carjacked by them. Jean complains about locksmith Daniel Ruiz (Michael Peña). Officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) is concerned about his partner John Ryan (Matt Dillon) after he stops TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton).<br/><br/>Paul Haggis weaves together a bunch of stories about the isolated nature of L.A. and the moments when they crash into each other. It tackles issues of race and perceptions. This has some great individual scenes. The problem is that Haggis has included so many characters that the heavy subject matter feel very superficial. For example, Sandra Bullock is playing a harsher character but the movie doesn't dig into her background. Haggis may have the best intention but the characters are thin while their stories are incredibly deep."

","This movie tried to be meaningful, and failed.<br/><br/>Crash force-feeds you racism from the standpoint of the writer and director, Paul Haggis. As the movie progresses, we are expected to learn all about the racist problems in the world, while at the same time, are fed underlying stereotypes about how different people of different races live their lives. The latter isn't intended.<br/><br/>This movie assumes that people live their lives with outrageous philosophies about religion, race and other people in general. The forced racism and stereotypical representation of the characters is quite flawed for a movie attempting to be so 'real' and true-to-life.<br/><br/>This movie, while completely centered on the topic of racism, really has nothing to do with racism - all at the same time. The complete point of the movie was to show the grittiness of racism in it's whole, from standpoints of different people in different situations. What we get is half human nature, one quarter anger and one quarter natural human nature.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie about racism that shows you how bad it really is, how out of hand it can get, and what a widespread problem it is in today's society, see American History X."

There was virtually no attempt at nuance, but rather black is white and vice versa. <br/><br/>Sure, I can appreciate that there is good and evil within us all as well as the movie's attempts to challenge stereotypes, but the plot was so over-the-top that it had zero credibility. A particularly egregious example was the storyline with the TV producer and his wife.

"Faceless_Moon","10","6","15","8 October 2005"," Lives up to the hype and then some...
","Recently bought this on DVD, having heard a lot of rave reviews for this film. It far surpassed any expectations i had. Crash is a brilliant ensemble piece about racism centering around a shooting by a white cop of a black cop, a car-jacking, and a racist cop pulling over an innocent black movie director and his wife. Director Paul Haggis has created a powerful, moving, and sometimes hard to watch masterpiece which only falters with the occasional cheesy line or gimmick (like one character's imitation of country music). But such things are easily forgiven or overlooked in the grand scheme of the film. The soundtrack is simple yet haunting, and the cinematography is absolutely top-notch, making the actions of the characters seem like real things done by real people, and not actors. The REAL reason this film is so good, however, is the acting. EVERY actor and actress in Crash is at the top of their game, and by the time the credits roll, viewers will have both favorite characters whom they connected and sympathized with, and characters who they will loathe for their actions. Though its hard to pick a favorite actor, i have to say that Ludicrous, Michael Pena, and especially Terrence Howard (who after this went on to star in the highly touted Hustle & Flow, with Ludicrous in a supporting role)gave riveting performances that stick with you after the film ends. Howard's climatic confrontation with certain characters towards the end of the film is by far one of the most dramatic, well-acted, and tense scenes i've witnessed in any movie in a long, lonnnng time. Watch this film. BELIEVE the hype. It will keep you talking and arguing with your friends hours after it ends."

","Crash is a story of redemption and second chances, about the toxicity that comes from polluted motivation, namely fear.<br/><br/>Told through the easily understood and recognized frame of racism in Los Angeles (no pre-story is required here as most viewers know of Watts District Riots, Rodney King, OJ Simpson, et al) a number of stories are interwoven and told in the manner of Claude Lelouche, Robert Altman, Terrence Tarrantino, et al.<br/><br/>When the edges of each of these stories touches on others, the true nature of shared experience of what can only be called institutionalized fear is engaged. Even newcomers are quickly made fearful and paranoid due to a culture of violence bred from incessant feelings of disconnectedness in their lives, their environments and their choices.<br/><br/>Crash challenges you to look beneath the layer of racism to explore the underlying message that in fear, in adversity, in us-and-them, only bad can result. But when motivated by strength and empowerment, when fear is left to lie, even those characters most despicable can be redeemed with second chances. A lovely thought."

What can I say after the events of 9/11 and 7/7 the world needed a film like this to show that beneath our skin colours, despite our different religions we are ALL the same, share the same hopes and aspirations. The casting was very good and I was pleasantly surprised by the rapper Ludicrus - he played his part well and a lot of the films basic premise depended on his performance. <br/><br/>Thandie Newton finally proves to the world she can act. I saw he debut in the British film The Young Americans (dir: Danny Cannon) and it was clear she wasn't just eye candy (watch her in Mission Impossible 2), there is a kind of fragility to her acting and when she is given the chance she can deliver. Her scenes with Matt Dillon are electric and the scene with the 'girl and bullet' was just heart pounding stuff. <br/><br/>This film should be shown in schools and colleges around the world because a young person watching this could end up viewing the world and his fellow human beings in a more positive way.

Best attempts I had glimpsed until now, where some of Kenneth Branagh's, and that's it. Which in turn makes me wonder that director Paul Haggis must be definitely involved in some kind of serious school of self work. Sandra Bullock's appearance is quite short, but it's the first time I happen to watch her out of the usual silly ""light"" stereotype and she does really great. Indeed, almost everyone performs a brilliant role here. Many actors are to become famous from this film on. Remember. The only pity with Crash is that it is so good that you don't want it to end, and when it does you feel that it's going to take quite a long time before something equally good is made again.

I could probably find you a million better films all around the world that will bring out the emotions of this film, and with much more depth and beauty.<br/><br/>Also,<br/><br/>there was so much in the movie that was taken directly from magnolia... it was reminiscent of Imaginary Heroes in comparison to American Beauty.. and by the way Imaginary Heroes is much better than Crash (it can make you laugh as well as cry), but of course you regular movie goers will probably never see it because it doesn't have the Hollywood names of Crash. Anyways, back to ways in which it resembles Magnolia aside from the obvious interconnectedness of such seemingly separate characters:<br/><br/>1) sick father in both films<br/><br/>2) long music sequence w/out dialogue<br/><br/>3) snow falling instead of frogs<br/><br/>4) portrayal of heroic cop ... I'm sure I can think of more, but this was all just on my first watching of Crash.<br/><br/>And... finally the character Sandra Bullock (the biggest actor/actress in the film)plays is entirely way too underdeveloped, and the scene in which she slips down the stairs is one of the cheesiest in movie history."

","Various denizens of Los Angeles cross paths in ironic, cathartic and, as they say, life-changing and life-affirming ways. ""Crash"", the Academy's choice for Best Picture of its year, is unabashedly melodramatic; hence, it hits a preachy speedbump now and then. Still, its themes of personal self-loathing, lack of self-worth, impatience and rage come across succinctly, both verbally and emotionally. It's a carefully planned (one may say shrewdly planned) portrait of apathy in our present-day society, though director Paul Haggis ensures intense and sobering moments. The film begins at an almost elemental level, yet it eventually raises the bar for social issue dramas, and the ensemble cast is very fine. Sandra Bullock stands out as a wealthy white woman distrustful of anyone who doesn't look like her and Matt Dillon is solid as a deeply troubled cop (both are redeemed by circumstance). Other Oscar wins included Bobby Moresco and Paul Haggis for their screenplay, from an original treatment by Haggis, and for Best Editing. Dillon was nominated as Best Supporting Actor, Haggis for his direction, and Kathleen York and Michael Becker for their song ""In the Deep"". *** from ****"

The actors are all superb especially Michael Pena, who I never even heard of that came out with an excellent performance. The script and directing by Paul Haggis is terrific and this man will sure make tons more of success in the future. He has been successful in every inch of the way so far.

","""Crash,"" the new film by Paul Haggis would play out even more like a slice-of-life urban drama if it weren't for the realities of the O.J. Simpson case, the Rodney King beating and the subsequent Los Angeles riots of 1992. That all these events took place in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, and that Haggis' film too is set within the City of Angels over the course of 36 hours, it's not without the blinding in-your-face irony of the reality it attempts to convey to the audience that we're looking into ourselves. Haggis has assembled one of the most dynamic casts for this multi-character drama that includes Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito, and Thandie Newton. In several poignant vignettes, the sensitive race issue is explored in deep, painful, and resentful fashions - no sides taken - and the people in the audience are left to ponder the film's message, as well as examine their own innermost prejudices. If it weren't for the realities depicted in ""Crash,"" we would not have such an in-depth look into the near-complete absence of human compassion and emotion.

"suspiria10","10","6","15","10 September 2005"," S10 Reviews: Crash (2004)
","'Crash' is the wonderfully told story of an unrelated group of Los Angelinos who are all quite literally crashing into each others lives. The many stories are finely interwoven with so many fine layers and textures. A black detective is working a case involving a cop shooting who also deals with his drug-addled mother and crook brother. A pair of philosopher car-jackers whose hypocritical musings perpetuate the very things they supposedly abhor, a District Attorney and his spoiled and pampered wife, a Persian shop owner and his family and a locksmith providing for his family. 'Crash' grabs you right from the beginning with Mark Isham's emotional deep and haunting music score. Paul Haggis (whose recent accolades include writing the equally emotional 'Million Dollar Baby') directs and produces his emotional and racially motivated script with amazing skill. Some films with this many stories can lose or alienate the viewer but 'Crash' is written like a page-turning novel, you couldn't stop it if you tried. The ensemble cast (Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraiser and dozens of others give amazing, high-caliber performances. Perfectly cast and wonderfully acted all the way around. 'Crash' is densely emotional and I dare you not to come away moved."

","This movie was thought-provoking and deep, but also very entertaining and quite funny at times. It gives an honest look at racism in America that will (hopefully) make you stop and think. It also keeps you on the edge of your seat with all its twists and turns. The plot is unlike most--you can't really pin-point a main character. The movie really focuses on several peoples' lives, first separately and then showing how they all come together, or ""crash"". I think it was excellently written, directed, produced, and acted. And best of all, it is more than pure entertainment. It is a social commentary that we would all be wise to listen to. I haven't seen a movie this good in a long time."

We can see through this film how we form opinions based on the color of a person's skin or the way they talk etc. This film also shows us how stupid these racist issues really are. It shows us how politicians try to manipulate their image to bring in the minority vote. If you can bring one thing out of this film, it should be that everyone is an individual and should be judged as such. I don't want to spoil the movie for everyone, but this is a very touching movie.

"davideo-2","10","6","15","23 August 2005"," The best film of the year so far!!!
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Los Angeles. A place of massive cultural diversity, that doesn't always go hand in hand together.<br/><br/>A man has been found murdered on the side of a lay-by. There's the black detective with the hispanic wife who's leading the case. His brother is a tear-away who couldn't have chosen a different life. There's the district attorney, obsessed with public appearance and his constantly angry, fussy wife. Their car is robbed by two young black men who've only become what they are because the society they live in has inadvertently allowed them to. The couple's door-lock is being fixed by a dodgy looking gang-member type who's in fact only trying to make ends-meet for his daughter. He gets into a dispute with his employer, an immigrant salesman who everybody mistakes him and his family for Iraqis. There's the reserved music producer and his wife who chastises him for not being manly enough, stopped by a cop with a dying dad and a racist grudge. There's his rookie partner, nervous about making a stand against it.<br/><br/>Cleverly combining the twin threats of a city already on the edge with a lot of post 9/11 angst still running rife, Crash is an intelligent, powerful, thoughtful, compelling and absorbing study of how prejudice and unjust phobia can tear not only a community apart but a city apart. It's an inspired and clever idea, high-lighting a lot of the potential ways in which the strife is caused. It shows not only the effect on the society, but on the soul as well, with the powerful score and the silent parts.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it's really a mix of those who's careers are already on a high and those who'll be lucky to be offered something as deep and meaningful again in years. Having seen Hotel Rwanda just last week, Don Cheadle continues to shine here in one of the lead roles. The film has a similar feel to Traffic, another film he was in, and it looks like he'll have a career appearing in these kind of arty, high-brow flicks and good for him that he's appearing in roles that are worthy of his talents. There's good work too from Sandra Bullock and, continuing to distance himself from his goofy earlier work, Brendan Fraser. Speaking of which, rap star Ludicrous is really one of the main stars of the show here, creating a great contrast with his clever, insightful presence here with his role in the slightly less provocative 2 Fast 2 Furious. Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillipe, two actors who've always left a bit to be desired, surprise and shine here and create a great double act as the harder, more influential older cop and the vulnerable, more naive rookie. And as for Thandie Newton, well, all I'll say is if I'd judged her on the basis of The Chronicles of Riddick (the only film I remember seeing her in!) I'd have been missing out on a lot. The remainder of the supporting cast are all very good as well.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Canadian Paul Haggis, who's only other theatrical release has been the little heard-of 1993 movie Red Hot. He handles it all well right until the end with the cloying use of the okay but woodenly over-used Stereophonics hit Maybe Tomorrow over the closing credits. But other than that, this is the best film of the year so far and one Crash that really makes an impact. *****"

","This movie totally blew me away. It's a complex analysis of race and culture with real, fully developed characters. ""Crash"" seeks to explain the inner thoughts of racism and explore why it is such an intractable problem and why everyone can't just get along. Every thread is connected, every motivation examined, every persona is shown to have inner strength conflicting with terrible weakness. This is an emotional movie, but one that earns its emotion, not a cheap tearjerker. The writing, direction, and acting is all top-notch. Very highly recommended. Since it's an ensemble cast with no one character getting large amounts of screen time, it'll be tough to wrangle out acting Oscars for this pic, but I hope the direction and screenplay won't go unnoticed by the Academy."
"melobruce","10","5","12","31 January 2007"," OK then....
","i've had a year to reflect on this film, and i have read every single post and review written on this IMDb site and i've finally decided to speak up. 1)the ensemble cast in this film did a remarkable job. this is one point that is hard to debate. Thandie, Matt, Don, Sandra, Ryan, Terraence,Pena; EVERYONE, was top notch. 2) the score in this film, was beautiful to listen to. 3) people who at first, appear to be racist, aren't. people who appear to be of high moral character, are flawed.<br/><br/>Brokeback Mountain deserved the best picture win; but for a consolation prize, i wasn't that upset by Crash's win. But this film is like this year's Dreamgirls. It is one thing to dislike a film. that is perfectly fine and in fact, criticism right or wrong is good for the industry. it's quite another thing, to call Jennifer Hudson an American idol reject, or say it made your day that it wasn't nominated for Best Picture. This is the case with Crash. the passion which this film is hated by the minority is mind boggling. if only we could get that worked up over environmental and global issues of justice and fairness, tolerance and peace. it's a belly laugh to hear people call Crash a racist film, and then follow it with a racist remark. It's fine to criticize Haggis's direction; it's another thing to bash his nationality and trash his country and ethnicity. what i have found, after reading these reviews, are that the people who hated this film for being contrived, over-hyped, done before, obviously done by a ""white man"", and so on, went on to call the majority who liked this film names, such as: for dummies, stupids; for the uneducated, racists, retarded, infantile (haha, the irony),trash lovers, commie lovers, lefties, hypocrites, and so on. the worst for me however, are the criticisms aimed at Paul for being Canadian. Yes; we Canadians are a rotten lot all right, who cant make movies (ahem). The National Film Board of Canada gives aspiring and acknowledged film makers more leeway than most, and is as lauded as and been around longer than the respected and liberal Sundance. Yes; Canada is a liberal nation. Canadians are just terrible people: they try to stay out of wars; they avoid going after ""terrorists"", even the American ones; they have no death penalty; they allow gays to marry; they tolerate marijuana (because they don't want to make people technically criminals, and aren't stupid); they get killed constantly by ""friendly fire"" and yet don't complain (it's not the Canadian way); they are there when American planes had to land on Canadian soil after 9/11 with food, shelter, and friendship; they smuggled imprisoned American people out of Iran; they hand out candy and goodies to children and adults on BOTH sides of any conflict; they have a small population and yet devote a huge percentage of people in peace-keeping efforts, if indeed there is such a thing; they stormed the beaches at Normandy and yet were never acknowledged for it and didn't care that they weren't; they get along with almost everyone; and yea, they produce great athletes...and actors too, whom Americans have embraced as their own; they marry Americans and people of all colours; and they truly are a melting pot and embrace multi-cultural ism; they don't have a freedom-killing Patriot Act; they aren't hated by most of the world;...yes indeed. A horrible bunch of people. so go ahead and hate this movie if you wish. that's fine. but stop short of name calling and nation bashing. Now THAT is true hypocrisy. It won the Best Picture award, right or wrong. And although as i've said, i thought BBM was the stronger picture, i am somewhat glad it won because of the absolute hatred and loathing and vitriol shown by the people who HATED this MOVIE, knowing that the name callers and critics who sound like they went to the bathroom five or six times during this film are even more ENRAGED by it. i'd laugh out loud but i'd be guilty of doing the same as those i've just spoken of. try to get over it. there's this year's Dreamgirls. You can spit your venom at something else now."

The movie shows a bunch of people in LA who are all connected to each other through racism. What made me want to see this movie wasn't what it was about, it was the long list of actors in the movie. There is Don Cheadle, Matt Dillion, Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Philippe, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Thandie Newton, and Terrance Howard who I hadn't heard of before this movie. the movie shows a bunch of races in a 24 hour period.

"lostribe","4","5","12","24 August 2006"," Contrived
","I was extremely disappointed with Crash. There were a lot of characters developed in the movie, and all of them said and did things that were more extremely rude or exaggerated than anything I have encountered in real life. In fact, almost every character was just a big jerk, and I didn't care what happened to them. There was one that was someone who seemed consistently nice and that you could empathize with. I can't believe Hollywoodites jumped all over this movie for an Oscar. It was entirely composed of contrived nonrealistic scenarios designed only to please uninformed idealists. And that's not me saying idealists are a bad thing, but I prefer smart ones who can face reality and deal with it while setting their sights higher. I don't see the point of making excuses for and glorifying in media a bunch of jerks in order to try to make them sympathetic when there are so many good people who may have also suffered bad circumstances but still chose to be a nice person instead of a jerk with an excuse. Let's glorify those people instead. And I believe there's many more of them than there is the other."

","I didn't see Crash until a few months after the Academy Awards. My top films of the year were not nominated, but that's okay. After all, it's only a popularity contest. Still, I like to see the films nominated, and the films that win.<br/><br/>Crash is a movie with a very good heart, very good concept, but has many moments that talk down to the audience, thinking that we are, well, stupid. Pieces of information are explained to us repeatedly, to make sure that we know. Why? Because they think that we didn't catch on the first, or the second, or the third time.<br/><br/>It's a thoughtful film about racism that examines it from every angle, with no good guys or bad guys. Because in reality, there are no good guys and bad guys. Just the good and bad we do. People told me thanks to this moral, I'd like the film. However, I'm an intelligent person and do not like being talked down to.<br/><br/>To enjoy crash you must do one thing that is very, very difficult: suspend your disbelief in a movie that tries to base itself in realism. I can't believe the impossible unless I am given reason to. Maybe in the world set up in ""Harry Potter"" I can believe some of the extreme coincidences might actually occur. Unfortunately, this is supposed to be the real world.<br/><br/>I wish I could warn you all a lot better then I am doing. Unfortunately, I do not want to ruin the movie. Sure, it would be for the best, but I try to be a competent reviewer. Perhaps I should try to review more competent films."
"futuretyrant14","1","5","12","1 May 2006"," A slow progression downwards.
","I must say that ""Crash"" left me a bit confused, not because I found it difficult to understand or hard to accept, but because it fooled me. It fooled me into liking it for all the wrong reasons. After hearing rave reviews from many people whose opinions I greatly respect, I decided to watch it and see for myself.<br/><br/>There are movies that get better every time you watch them, like ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe,"" and then there are movies like ""Crash"" which sink lower and lower, until you wonder how anybody could ever enjoy such a movie. My main objection to this movie is that it sets itself up as the true and gritty face of modern racism, but cops out and settles for ease and audience appeal rather than gutsy decision-making. I found the dialogue to be woefully written and poorly used throughout the movie. I read a review which called the dialogue ""bumper sticker quotes"" and I couldn't agree more. ""Crash"" tries to be realistic and striking but the dialogue makes it cliché and pedantic. It talks down to the viewer and takes a moral high-ground which it cannot support.<br/><br/>After thinking more about the movie, and questioning my initial positive reaction, I realized that the movie only appeals to human vanity. One leaves the movie feeling they have gone through an emotional journey, but they ultimately feel good about themselves. The fact that a movie which purports deal with cross-spectrum racism refuses to make the viewer question their own secret bigotries makes it a terrible failure in my mind. I say so because it had the potential to be so much more; ""Crash"" could have been better, and it could have actually deserved the Oscar, had it not gone for the safe Hollywood ending. When tackling a subject such as racism, it feels like an artistic let-down to leave the theatre feeling good.<br/><br/>I don't think movies should be judged against other movies, that just leaves too much room for subjective argument. When deciding if a movie is good or not, one has to compare what the movie accomplishes against what the movies tries to do. For it's shameless appeal to happy endings, it's insultingly preachy dialogue, and it's tendency to say everything while expressing nothing at all, ""Crash"" fails in the worst way a movie can. It is nothing but a bland pat-on-the-back, and we can now turn away from the issue of racism because ""Crash"" thinks it has solved it for us.<br/><br/>I once counted myself among those duped by ""Crash,"" but I hope that with time and contemplation, more people come to see how superficial and uninspiring this movie really is."

Cultures and diversities are explored, as you are shown the stories of people of different ethnicities and races. What I think?

Crash really makes you think of how different cultures/races are treated by by everyone. Constant wars are plaguing us today and this movie really helps me see why these wars have started and it really makes me think about how we NEED tolerance in society if were going to live in peace. This movie sends the message of, it doesn't matter what colour you are or where you come from or who you worship. We are all humans and we need to tolerate each other.<br/><br/>Crash has one of the best casts I have ever seen. Actors like Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Thandie Newton and Ludicrous all lend their talents to make this movie an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>The plot follows the lives of a group of people including a cop, a movie producer, a politician and two street crims, in Los Angelas in the 24 hours that leads up to a car crash that will link them all...<br/><br/>This movie is really an unforgettable experience. The performances are flawless. Bullock and Fraser are great as the rich married couple, Newton is great as the sexually abused wife of a scared movie director and Dillon is very good as the cop struggling with life. I'm not surprised if any of these gets nominated for an Oscar, they all deserve it.<br/><br/>The movies main moral/message is tolerance of other cultures. This may seem clichéd and boring but Paul Haggis has done a great job at making this a great, original piece of cinematic brilliance that needs to win a lot of Oscars.

","I missed Crash in the theatre. It came and went too quickly, and I only saw it once it came to DVD. And after I did, I watched it four times in two days. This is movie that exemplifies the best in story telling, movie making and acting.<br/><br/>I admit I didn't have a strong feeling about the movie. I just rented because I hadn't seen it yet. And five minutes in, I was ready to stereotype this as just another cliché liberal sermon on racism. That quickly changed about 6 minutes in. I misjudged the movie, just as the characters in it misjudge each other. This is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Rarely can a movie make you laugh, cry, feel outraged and embarrassed all at the same time. But this one does.<br/><br/>The overall movie making here is wonderful in every way. But I was blown away by the level of acting here. Every character, even in the smallest bit part, is someone I felt I completely understood. Ryan Phillippe (Officer Hanson), Sandra Bullock (Jean), Don Cheadle (Graham), Shaun Toub (the Iranian store owner) and Terrence Howard (Cameron) each take us through their private journey with honesty and force. Chris ""Ludicris"" Bridges (Anthony) delivers an excellent performance in his first film, and I expect to see big things from him.<br/><br/>Like its title suggests, this a movie where in modern LA people don't merely intersect, but 'crash' into one another -- sometimes out of serendipity, sometimes tragically. Don Cheadle, in my opinion, is the anchor of the movie. The torture of his character is painful to watch and his simple, understated deliverance is powerful.<br/><br/>The two scenes involving both Matt Dillon (Ryan) and Thandie Newton (Christine) are so intense you are afraid to watch and afraid to look away at the same time.<br/><br/>While so much has been made of the racial implications of this movie, for me, the heart of the movie comes from the interaction between Michael Pena (Daniel) and his daughter Ashlyn Sanchez (Lara, played wonderfully by the young Sanchez), and by Bahar Soomekh (Dorri, whose beautiful eyes fill the scene with emotion and tenderness) and her interaction with her parents. These three characters represent the only true goodness and purity in the movie. All other characters are flawed and 'crashing' tragically into one another, but these three represent what we all want in ourselves.<br/><br/>Director Paul Haggis has created a masterpiece here. Every scene, every line, every lighting shot, is one that can be analyzed and studied for years to come. When create a work that complete, it eclipses by far, in my opinion, his overly rewarded work on ""Million Dollar Baby"". This is a movie people will remember for decades."

When Sandra Bullock says, ""I'm angry all the time and I don't know why,"" she encapsulates what has become the modern American experience. We are all shown and told by the media why we should hate or distrust others. O'Reilly, Hannity, etc. make money off of fostering anger and resentment and a lot of it sticks. ""Crash"" shows us that once we wipe away that first layer of defense, however, we are all capable of warmth and compassion. The scene where Matt Dillon's character (who hates black people) helps the black woman in the burning car is something that would surely happen. I'm sure, for instance, that many black and white Katrina victims were pulled from their homes by ""racists,"" both black and white.<br/><br/>What the film shows is that we're all human and we all know it, regardless of the crap we hurl at each other from the anonymous safety of our cars or in front of our televisions. Somehow, during this film, I was reminded of the way I've always looked at Heaven: To me, it's a place where we value each person and don't have to think of them defensively. There's no anger, no prejudice, no fear. Only love. ""Crash"" shows us that resentment and suspicion are unique commodities of Earth -- and sometimes necessary commodities at that. Many times in the film, a person's suspicion or resentment of another is justified. But what a glimpse of how life could be without it. I give it an A+"

","From a technical standpoint, this movie was extremely well done. However, it beats you over the head with the common liberal talking points, and was very predictable. 10 minutes into the film, I understood that Guns are evil, period. NO exceptions. Also, nobody is responsible for their lot in life, everything that happens to a person that is bad is because of situations completely out of their control, but mostly because of how they look, and money and power can, under no circumstances, bring happiness. Hoooey. *Spoiler* I would like to present a slightly different view, regarding the shopkeeper; Farhad. Let's suppose that instead of using the gun to shoot the little girl, he was in his shop when the ""thugs"" robbed it. Then, let's suppose that by luck, or proper planning (which is irrelevant, because he couldn't even plan to properly fix the door in the first place, another liberal talking point, nothing was his fault...), he was able to get to his gun. The thugs are armed, as they are throughout this film, so Farhad fires in proper and true self defense. But, his daughter bought him blanks, so the thugs shoot back, with their guns acquired illegally, not wanting to be bothered by laws, as thugs often do, and kill him with REAL bullets. Hmmm. The daughter sure would have a different part in this movie, then, huh? Farhad should have gone to jail, for attempted first degree murder, but that's not how the happy ending worked out. Detective Waters' brother should have been in jail, not out with his racist buddy ""jacking"" black Navigators; and his brother is responsible for his death, not the way his mother implied, but by shielding him from responsibility for his actions - being his enabler, to which his mother is also guilty.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Racism and Guns (not necessarily in that order) are the cause of all evil in the world."

","This is an exceptional film on all levels. Technically it is masterful. The filming is exceptional. The acting is top notch all the way through. There is a lot of very deep, but suppressed emotion, in the acting. There were no weak performances throughout this film. There was one scene that perhaps could have been edited a little more tightly, but that is a genuinely trivial complaint. This film really hit the mark with me.<br/><br/>Structurally, this film is very close to ""Short Cuts"" by Robert Altman, which is also a favorite of mine. This tells the interwoven stories of an ensemble cast of characters as they face the frustrations of daily living. Racism isn't black and white. Interspersed throughout the film are the multiple nuanced facets of racism in all of their ugly shades of grey. There is no overt KKK-style racism here. It's all about the subtle assumptions that we make of people based on their appearance. Sometimes those assumptions are correct, but wrong. Sometimes they are wrong, but correct.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant screenplay. Sure there are some coincidences that are quite unlikely, but they are there to contribute to the point of the stories, so that level of poetic license is quite alright with me. It didn't detract from the message.<br/><br/>There are so many wonderful actors and performances in this movie that it is unfair to pick out one out. However, I thought Don Cheadle - whose acting I am always admired - had the best performance of his career. His ability to convey emotion through expression was just plain exceptional.<br/><br/>It takes a truly exceptional movie to impress me enough to earn a 10 of 10. This is just such a movie."

If your view of watching a movie is rational, and via rational feel something than that's one way. ""Crash"" is an impressionistic masterpiece.

For this reason I can't say I loved the movie. It makes it very difficult to get absorbed into the movie because just when you begin to get attached to a character your thrown into another story. It's this jumpy disconnect that I had a problem with. I found myself comparing the movie to 21 GRAMS in the sense that they are both emotionally driven movies that have an evolving story.

"jotix100","10","7","19","26 May 2005"," The city of angels
","Paul Haggis immense achievement in ""Crash"" left us breathless and speechless. Mr. Haggis and his collaborator and screen writer, Robert Moresco, take us to an area where most American film makers, or studios, dare not go. We are given a series of unconnected stories, that at one level, seem not to make sense, and at the end of the film, we are surprised to realize how everything one sees in the film is inter connected in one way, or another.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is not a film that wants to be politically correct. The ugly truth of race relations in America are nowhere more visible than in the Los Angeles of today, where Mr. Haggis places the story. The city, with its complexity of cultures, is the right territory where one can see the way things are done in that city, which might stand as an example of a multi-racial community in America today.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you'd like to stop reading here.<br/><br/>Los Angeles police has been at the center of several notorious cases, which in a way, seems to parallel what the film is following. At the same time, we are shown decent people in that department trying to cope with the job to protect its citizens of all colors and races.<br/><br/>One of those people happen to be Graham, the detective that is battling his own demons. His mother is a drug addict that is trying to go straight. His own brother is a common criminal ready to hijack valuable cars for a profit. Graham must make a deal at the end of the film in order to protect his brother. In a way, he too, is a victim of the same system that he is trying to uphold.<br/><br/>We meet a black bourgeois couple Cameron and Christine, who are stopped by a cruising patrol car when something lewd seems to be taking place in the car. The crooked police officer Graham humiliates and belittles this innocent couple that happened to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. Cameron is a spineless black who would rather be abased than open his mouth to protest officer Graham's indecent groping of Christine. Graham's partner Hanson is indignant about what he watches his partner do to the helpless woman.<br/><br/>There is also an up and coming yuppie couple, Rick and Jean, who we see walking to their car. Two black hoodlums mug them and rob their expensive Navigator SUV. He turns out to be a D.A. that is more interested in the image he would project to black minorities if he goes too hard on the guys that steal his car. The wife, though, has no problem in spewing her venom directed to the Hispanic man, Daniel, that has been summoned to change the locks of the house.<br/><br/>Daniel, the Hispanic locksmith is also called to fix a lock at an Iranian store whose owner is Farhad, an indignant man reduced to do menial things. Daniel fixes the lock, but not the door itself that earlier is seen as not closing properly. When Farhad tells Daniel about it, he tells he fixed the problem, but the door is not his concern. Daniel is cursed by the ignorant man that cannot comprehend how the locksmith refuses to fix the door. Instead of reasoning, the Iranian goes into a frenzy. When the store is broken into, later on, Farhad's reaction is that Daniel has done it. There's only one way to fix the problem: take the gun to Daniel's home and kill him.<br/><br/>Daniel has moved his family from a crime infested area to this new neighborhood where he feels it's safe to live with his family. We watch Daniel in a tender moment with his daughter in which an imaginary invisible cape that will protect the girl. That same imaginary cape is what seems to save her from the shot directed to her father, as she happens to get in front of it. This sobering experience will change both Farhad and Daniel.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a study in contrasts. The same bigoted Graham, who has been so nasty in the earlier episode, in a twist of fate, is drawn to the accident site where Christine is trapped in her vehicle. Graham valiantly and showing no concern for his own life pulls a hysterical Christine, who has recognized him, from the wreckage.<br/><br/>The film has an unique texture as it build layer upon layer on all what we are watching, enriching the it as the multiple stories succeed one another.<br/><br/>Mr. Haggis triumph lays in the excellent performances he has obtained from the wonderful cast put together. Don Cheadle makes another magnificent appearance as Graham. Mr. Cheadle, who helped produced the film, has another opportunity in which to shine.<br/><br/>Terrence Howard as the cowardly Cameron shows he has a tremendous range as he goes from one extreme to another. Mr. Howard, one of the best actors around shows why he is one of the best in the business. Thandie Newton is also good as Christine, a woman who can't understand her husband and resents his lack of courage. Matt Dillon as the prejudiced policeman has the best opportunity of his career in a short, but quite excellent role.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillipe, Loretta Devine, Michael Pena, William Fichtner, Larenz Tate, Shaun Toub, among others do amazing ensemble work under the inspired direction of Mr. Haggis.<br/><br/>This is an important film that shows us how each one of us is directly affected by bias and prejudice. Mr. Haggis triumphs in that he is not preachy, but point out to what he sees wrong with our society."

","""Crash"" tells the intertwining stories of several Los Angeles residents as their lives are touched by racism in various ways. Some are victims, some are perpetrators, all are changed by their experiences.<br/><br/>One thing that I will say about the story is that it throws subtlety out the window. I found it painfully obvious who I was supposed to sympathize with. There are no 'gray' characters, only black and white. Then, throughout the course of the film everyone learns some sort of blatant 'life lesson' and is usually the better for it.<br/><br/>At least the cast is an excellent one with several fine performances from talented individuals like Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Michael Peña and Matt Dillon. There were a couple of questionable casting choices but for the most part the acting was well above average.<br/><br/>Haggis's direction wasn't bad but I'm struggling to recall anything at all about it that made it stand out. Similarly, I can't recall even a single piece of music from the film, so that area obviously didn't make any sort of impression on me.<br/><br/>While this film beat ""Brokeback Mountain"" for the Best Picture of 2005 I think that that was a huge mistake. The acting may be excellent but the story is dumbed down so that the 'message' can be grasped by even the dimmest audience members."
"Navaros","1","4","9","11 March 2008"," Message of this movie is false, and doesn't work.
","Crash tries to be a complex anti-racism movie, meant to besmirch every human being by saying that every human being is racist to at least some degree. <br/><br/>Plain and simple, the message of Crash is supposed to be:<br/><br/>""Everyone is racist.""<br/><br/>Crash's solution this problem, the way for everyone to no longer be racist, is:<br/><br/>""Everyone should trust every other human being in the world implicitly, even if they are total strangers.""<br/><br/>Which is obviously an asinine idea that can never work in real-life. Completely ludicrous. I saw Terence Howard on Charlie Rose a couple of years ago, promoting the movie Crash. Howard told Charlie Rose that Crash was the best thing that exists for mankind, and if everyone listened to and applied the message of Crash in real-life, it would be the single best thing that could ever happen in the world to change the world for the better.<br/><br/>But, Terence Howard was wrong. Trusting every other human being implicitly for the sake of ""not being racist at all"" would only lead to those who do so being taken advantage of horribly. It wouldn't help society at all, it would just make nefarious activities against other human beings *easier* for the law-breaking thugs to commit.<br/><br/>The Ryan Phillippe character in Crash is *supposed* to be alleged by this movie to be racist because he shot a thug who it looked like was about to shoot him. That alleged racism is bogus. He wasn't shooting him because of his race, he was shooting him because he was a violent criminal thug and that was very evident from his hostile demeanour, irrespective of his skin color. This is another area the intended message of this movie fubars. Claiming that any negative thought or action taken against any member of another race, is wrong & racism by default. That is what the movie promotes, but that is not so. To delude one's self in believing that anyone who is not the same race as one's self is inherently good, and any negative thoughts or actions against them are wrong & racist no matter what, is not ridding the world of racism. It's ridding the world of common sense. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, racism does indeed exist, and racism is indeed bad. No one is arguing with that. Where Crash gets it wrong is in stating that every human being is racist, and going through life without trusting implicitly every stranger in the world who is not the same race as you, is racism. Due to message of Crash being incorrect, impossible to rationally apply in real-life, and therefore failing, and the fact that Crash has no artistic merit or reason for existing beyond trying to promote that message, Crash is not a good movie. <br/><br/>The acting in Crash is phenomenal from everyone, except for from Ludicrous who is a real-life rapper (not an actor). Ludicrous gives an embarrassingly-awful performance and clearly he is *vastly* out of his league playing in this movie, which aside from himself, is comprised of a huge ensemble of nothing other than master actors. To add insult to injury, Ludicrous' lines in the movie reek of hypocrisy, and consist of him getting up on a soapbox and renouncing rap music as evil that ruins Black youth even though the rap music he describes in the movie is *exactly* the same rap music he himself makes in real-life. I realize that an actor playing a role is just an actor playing a role, but that paradigm does not apply to the movie Crash in particular since Ludicrous in my opinion was not cast in this movie for reasons relating to his (complete lack of) acting talent. And because the purpose of Crash is not like most movies, to entertain, but rather the purpose is solely to deliver the message: ""Everyone is racist, and you must trust every other human being implicitly in order not to be racist."" Therefore the hypocrisy of Ludicrous delivering lines about the evil of rap music in Crash reeks extra much. <br/><br/>Great acting from everyone but Ludicrous is not enough to save Crash, though, since it has nothing else going for it. Crash is also painful to watch and listen to due to the terrible foreign elevator-music singing that is constantly blaring over most of the scenes. In my opinion, some badly-done production elements of Crash are a result of reverse-racism/affirmative-action at work: the casting of Ludicrous even though he can't act at all but just because he's a popular Black man in pop culture, and filling the movie with terrible foreign elevator-music singing throughout because then it gets token points for giving ""foreign talent"" a chance. Don't get me wrong on this either, foreign music is *fine* if it's *good*. The problem with Crash is that it sounds like they just greenlighted the very first piece of crap terrible foreign elevator-music singing that came across their desk *only* because it was foreign, and decided to plaster it all over the movie. Woe comes to the ears of the viewing audience as a result.<br/><br/>Note: While writing this review, I have in fact spelled Ludicrous' name in the proper way how he wants it to be spelled: ""L-u-d-a-c-r-i-s""- every time I used it. However, IMDb's automatic ""spellcheck"" changes it automatically to ""Ludicrous"" every single time without any input from me or choice to prevent that. This is not carelessness or ignorance on my part, it's simply the automated spellcheck forcing these mis-spellings into this review. Maybe it's Divine Intervention. to be seen as an omen about Ludcrious' acting talent? I don't know, but the point is, the mis-spelling of his name in this review is due to automation beyond my control, not due to any error on my part.<br/><br/>Crash is probably the greatest ensemble of acting talent ever put into a bad movie that goes nowhere and accomplishes nothing."

It was shameless, from the so-called interconnectedness of the characters (who just need a little unconditional love and a group hug) to the bogus ""lets all stop the madness and look at the falling snowflakes"" ending.

","If everybody in the real world would act the way they did in ""Crash"" then we really are in big trouble. I understand that it is custom in movies to exaggerate in order to make a point. But the way they handled the issues in the movie made me quite sick. Everything was to the extreme and not realistic. The scene where the shop owner Farhad refuses to listen to the locksmith (Pena) because he thinks he tries to cheat him is a good illustration of that. It even gets more ridiculous when he doesn't acknowledge that he was responsible himself for not having the door fixed and blames Pena for ruining his business. The fact that he feels so strongly about this that he wants to kill him is something that doesn't make any sense. If people would act like this then we would have anarchy on our hands. All the characters in ""Crash"" seem to be occupied with the race issue every single minute of their lives. While that can be true for some that certainly is not depicting a realistic view. If racism in real life was as clear cut as in the movie then it would have been very easy to deal with it. But in real life racism is much more complicated and subtle. There are only a few who openly admit that they are racist and dare to speak up in public. The majority of the people do it behind people's backs and never say the things like some of the characters have said in the movie. At least not directly. Sure they would think it or tell another what they thought. But most people probably don't even realize that they are guilty of making racist comments. And that is where the real problem lies. I do think that ""Crash"" has some redeeming values. Some of the performances are truly excellent. And there were more than enough scenes that were moving. The moving scenes and the stellar performances make this a movie worth seeing. However I do hope that in future that a movie will be made that actually shows how racism works in real life."

Here, every character is either racist or a victim of racism, and if he/she is a racist it's because there's a reason, some sort of trauma in his past. Every character is one-dimensional and learns a lesson in the end. The dialogs sound fake, and the ONLY theme is racism, racism, racism. That even makes it less realist because people tend to speak about several subjects. Paul Haggis seems to think people will only understand the message if he repeats it all the time. All with me ""Racism is bad, racism is bad, racism is bad"". Now repeat this 500 times and you'll have a good part of this movie done. Even if obviously this is an important message, you don't need it to be thrown into your face. The stories come together in unnatural way, using to many coincidences, making it look false and predictable after some time. The changes some of the characters go through in the end are ridiculous and there's no reason for the to happen. Even if this is not a boring movie, it tries too hard to get you to feel something. If the characters had been better this would have been possibly a good movie. I'm not saying all were bad; a few had a certain dimension and their struggles were touching.<br/><br/>The acting is the best thing about this movie. All the actors are very talented and make the most out of their parts. Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Michael Peña, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard and Sandra Bullock (during the first part of the movie) were very god. The worst performance was by Ludicrous, who just seemed too self-conscious and fake to me.<br/><br/>Paul haggis direction is lame.I know he lacks experience, but I think this movie needed a raw, realistic style, not the emotionally manipulative shots used. Al the slow moving scenes, the bad use of sound and the still camera in angles that lack interest are useless.<br/><br/>The technicals are good. The editing is simple and common in this type of movie, not original but well executed. The music is well chosen and beautiful. The photography, even if sometimes it should have been dirtier locking, creates some images with the right mood.

I managed to see Crash before Brokeback, and really enjoyed it, but even with some of it's problems, I still feel that Brokeback deserved the award.<br/><br/>Crash chronicles the lives of various individuals over the span of two days, and how their lives and stories intertwine through violence and racism. The ensemble cast, including Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon (the only Oscar nomination amongst the cast), Thandie Newton, Sandra Bullock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Ryan Phillippe, along with many others, bring the story to life, and are all given a very ample amount of time to prove their worth in the full scheme of the story.<br/><br/>I was mesmerized by most of Crash as I watched it. The acting was great from almost everyone. These are actors playing real characters, and not cardboard cut-outs. Yes, a few members of the cast (like Bullock, Howard and Dillon) are nowhere near as good as others (like Cheadle, Bridges and Phillippe). And unfortunately, some of the great performances are overshadowed because of the need for some form of equal time on the screen for all of the actors. And for that reason, only one of the actors managed to pull off an Oscar nomination, which easily could have turned into numerous nominations if some of the other stronger actors had a chance to shine more. No one said being in an ensemble cast was easy and rewarding.<br/><br/>The gritty feel of the film also added to the authenticity that the film contributes. Even though Paul Haggis is a Canadian, I will be damned if I do not contend that he paints a great picture of Los Angeles. His great screen writing talent only becomes better as a result of his excellent directing. His co-written words emanate throughout the entire production, and make for a hell of a greatly made film.<br/><br/>But, even with us living in racist times, the question of just how racist everyone is really comes to mind. This film paints a picture of everyone in a city being totally racist. Some fight against it, but cannot help but turn out to be just as racist as the next person. But how realistic is that sentiment? I know for a fact that a lot of people are tolerant of others and their culture, so how is it fair to make it seem like everyone is racist? Had Haggis and Co. made some of the cast a lot more tolerant, the film would only become even more realistic than it is. At the point they left it at, it just really feels half-baked and incomplete. It feels weak in these instances, and it really does take away from the feeling the film has when it finishes.<br/><br/>If Brokeback had its boring points sparked with fabulous performances, Crash has problems with its realism. It wants to be totally real in its creation, but the way it ends up being painted just is not. Crash is a great film, but it is one who is unworthy of the Best Picture prize.<br/><br/>9/10."

","This movie was phenomenal. Some may think that there were not enough Asians in this racially charged film, but we must keep in mind that the Asian population is not very large in LA. Lots of really good irony, and double standards, and hypocrisy. It makes you think about your own prejudices and how deeply they can lie so you don't realize you're prejudiced. It was very emotionally charged and very affecting. You also learn about the potential for change and learning from mistakes and experiences. This is a movie than can potentially change your life. We believe that if the entire world saw this film the world would be a different place."

","""Crash"" was recommended to me by friends and relations. After I watched this movie, I know why they recommended it to me. I feel this film not only touched on the racial issues that still do exist in today's society, but it also reminds us that underneath the physical surface, we are human beings with emotions, minds and souls. ""Crash"" also sheds light on how society keeps racism alive and thriving by not letting go of past incidents and issues. The irony/karma in the scene where the police officer pulls the accident victim from the car is POWERFUL. You just never know who is your friend one day and your nemesis the next.<br/><br/>I also feel this film strongly suggests that people do not stop and think about what exactly it is they are doing when they judge based on race. I do not feel this film is manipulative or over-stated...it is the real deal. Some of the issues portrayed in ""Crash"" are issues I and friends have experienced first-hand. I think it sends a strong message about how karma finds us when assumptions of others are made, especially when these assumptions are based strictly on race. I found this film very powerful, informative and it left me with a feeling of sadness that racism is still haunting and victimizing our society. Kudos!"

","I just saw Crash and now I'm angry enough to write this comment. Not even a place as culturally homogenized as Los Angeles with its goofy plasticized population can be this phony. Crash is slick and glossy with lots of name actors but the story is braindead lame.<br/><br/>The bad cop is redeemed and becomes a good cop -- the bad white rich lady sees the light and becomes a good white rich lady. The bad black kid gets away because of the mistreated black director -- who is very angry at ""the man"" -- and the good black kid gets shot to death -- by the good cop. This isn't even a bad soap opera. We don't get a three dimensional sense of racism from this film. There's just no grit here it's all too smooth and tidy.<br/><br/>What really pushed me over the edge was the brave little super girl who uses her magic cape to save her misunderstood Hispanic daddy from the bad Iranian man. I was waiting for her to spit the bullet out of her mouth and fly through the air. <br/><br/>Oh, but it wasn't really a magic cape, the bullets were blanks -- don't you know? Talk about a lucky coincidence. Coincidence is this film's middle name with one coincidence occurring right after another. They should have named it ""LA Coincidence"" instead of stealing the name of Cronenberg's much better film.<br/><br/>This movie is a series of vignettes that are supposed to connect up and make us see the big racist picture -- and the light of redemption, I presume. It's a direct ripoff of Grand Canyon and Magnolia except instead of frogs we get ""snow"".<br/><br/>I really resent being sucked in by sleazy marketing and this time I blame the idiots over at the Oscars. What a bunch of a** holes trying to be different from all the other awards ceremonies I guess and giving the best pic Oscar to this drivel.<br/><br/>Crash is not really a good film, it's a slick film with a lame story executed in a disjointed manner with characters so shallow you can barely relate to them."

","""Crash"" was for me definitely the movie highlight of this year. It reveals a touching, thrilling story about inter cultural America, were sometimes everything seems hopeless, yet a glitter of hope always seems to shine through. The action involves a variety of persons from the most different cultural, social and family background, linked together by the coincidental streets of Los Angeles. It is interesting to view people interacting with each other without knowing what the other experiences in his daily life. A cop (Matt Dilon), whose father lost his business because of the black minority and is now very ill, has racist outbursts. A rookie (Ryan Phillipe) cannot agree with prejudice and racism, asks to change his partner, but societies public opinion about ""niggas"" gets to him and he reacts impulsive, shooting a car thief without reason. Cameron (Terrence Howard), a black movie director, is being stopped and his wife is being molested by a cop. He hesitates. He doesn't react. But his rage cumulates within, ready to burst at any moment... the list goes on. <br/><br/>This movie describes a shaky society, dominated by prejudice, fear and confusion. The ""Land of the free"" doesn't have free citizens. They cannot free themselves from common belief without feeling guilty (Sandra Bullock) and continue living drenched in fear.<br/><br/>An impressive movie, which makes me ask myself - why did the American Film Academy even consider giving the Oscar for best movie to ""Brokeback Mountain"", with a movie like ""Crash"" out there. A definite 10!!! A well deserved Oscar!!! Great!"

Certainly, I have my choice for best movie. My choice is pretty simple: the movie will attract me going back cinema again or rent a DVD to watch more times. In fact, I watched Crash and didn't feel too bad at first, but didn't intend to watch again. After watching Brokeback Mountain and Munich, I almost forgot that. Sometime, I wonder why so often a great movie didn't win Oscar. Maybe the Academic members never really care a movie only on its artistic achievement. They think too much."

This has all been done before in other movies. In the heat of the night, Mississippi burning and many others in the last 20-30 years.If it was about racism it should have also focused on EVERY minority in LA, Jews, gays American Indian (though very few in LA), and a dozen others. I have never seen a best picture only win 3 Oscars total in the last 20 years that I can recall. i really did not feel any sympathy for any of these people except for don cheadle's character and the Hispanic locksmith. it focused too much on the scumbag car jackers than anyone else. it seemed the academy had a difficult time this year deciding who to give the most awards to so they said, ""lets divide them between brokeback and crash and give crash the best award because we don't want to upset the right wing groups. It didn't seem to bother the academy in 1969 when they gave it too an x- rated ""midnight cowboy"" Maybe times haven't changed so much???"

","If you take a book of O Henry stories, and you start reading the first story, then after the first page skip to the second story, and keep doing that till the end of the book, and then start over with the second pages, until you're done with the book, that's what Crash is. Except in Crash, the characters are all in more than one story, and they're played by famous people too. (""Hey, that's Tony Danza!"")<br/><br/>Oh, and they're all different races too, like Black and White, and Persian-Not-Arab, so this makes the film very important. And Ludicrous is in it, so that's a good thing. Ludicrous, like most of the characters, is prejudiced. He's prejudiced against White people and Chinese, and also against Negroes too! And he doesn't tip.<br/><br/>The other good thing about this movie is it has a Message. Not a Message like Seventh Heaven (You can be the best preacher in the North American viewing area but if you're wife's not happy, nobody's happy) but a really important Message, which is Bad People Are Not All Bad, and Good People Aren't As Good As You Think. This is a really good Message, and probably should have been the name of the movie instead of Crash.<br/><br/>It's called Crash, by the way, because people in the movie get up in each other's faces, like they're Crashing around in bumper cars. Can you picture Sandra Bullock in a little helmet with a chin strap, driving around in a bumper car and rear-ending Thandie Newton, who also has on a little helmet? THAT would be entertaining!<br/><br/>So. To summarize: 1. People in L.A. don't like each other because they're different races and there is too much traffic, 2. You need to actually go see the movie so you know this for sure, 3. After you see the movie and Get the Message you will be a better person and be happy it won the Oscar, instead of a silly movie like Munich or Good Night and Good Luck."

","In DVD viewing, I found this film very much failed to make good on its hype. It is well made and certainly well acted, but not nearly as inspired as the filmmaker seems to think that it is. Though the story is focused on racial issues, the dramatic events of the film are really driven mostly by a series of contrived coincidences, leading to carefully orchestrated moments of tragedy, all of which lack the ring of truth. If you have never considered that race might be a complicated personal issue, than this film might give you something to think about. Otherwise, I would rate it as a well done writing excercise, and not much more."
"phnxdown","5","4","9","13 October 2005"," Half of a good movie
","At first, this movie is intriguing. It's forward about race issues in a way that few films in America (that aren't by Spike Lee) are. It gives the illusion of being cleverly written, luring you in with the opening sequence and its haunted musing on why the people in L.A. crash into each other.<br/><br/>*spoiler(s)*<br/><br/>There are several scenes that stand out in a positive light as they stretch towards the climax of the film. Ludicrous playing a carjacker that sees rap as the ""oppressor's music"" is amusing as an out-of-context irony. I like the scene with the attorney's wife (Sandra Bullock) ranting about the Mexican locksmith (Michael Pena) because it showcases more than one kind of prejudice. Not only is race an issue at this point, because of Ludicrous' carjacking, but any race that isn't white has become a threat. What if a white person had jacked her car? In addition, the personal/cultural choice of tattoos has affected her impression of the locksmith. What if a white person with tattoos was her locksmith?<br/><br/>The storyline focusing on Michael Pena's Daniel character remains the best throughout the film. The scenes concerning the ""impenetrable cloak"" are priceless. Daniel's daughter, Lara - played by Ashlyn Sanchez, is the ultimate reminder that our decisions about race/culture issues don't merely affect our individual selves, they also inevitably affect our children. The relief I felt at realizing the gun was filled with blanks remains my strongest emotion attached to the film. Additionally, the race and culture conflicts between a Hispanic American and a Persian American work well because they aren't over-analyzed as, say, the issues between black and white.<br/><br/>I also appreciated Matt Dillon's character and his interactions with just about everyone, but most obviously and especially Christine (Thandie Newton) and Shaniqua (Loretta Devine).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Haggis' obsession with coincidence forces the film to eat itself throughout the denouement, abandoning whatever promise the first half held for us. Officer Hanson's (Ryan Phillipe) scene with Peter (Larenz Tate) is completely contrived and forced. It's just a convenient mish-mash of all the conversations Peter had with Anthony (Ludacris) earlier in the film, from country music to the mini-statue of the saint. The feeling that things were being brought ""full-circle"" in terms of character connection ended up being a huge letdown. It's icing on the crap-cake that Phillipe is completely unbelievable as a fan of country music. <br/><br/>Finally, Anthony freeing all of the illegal immigrants in the middle of the city is just laughable. Not only is it unlikely from the perspective of character motivation, but the sheer thoughtlessness it would take to set them loose in the street like that is inconsistent with the kindness at the base of the gesture. It almost would have been better to see some of them get caught. Better still would have been avoiding this scene altogether, and at all costs.<br/><br/>In addition, as of March 8th, I feel the need to add that this film never ever should have won the Oscar for Best Picture... especially not in a field considering Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Good Night and Good Luck, and Munich."

","""Crash"" is not that great of a movie. In fact, by the time it is said and done, it is hardly a complete movie at all. I'm still not sure what the theme of this movie is?? Racism? What you have with ""Crash"" is a few interlocking stories with various people that happen to cross each others paths. ""Crash"" has a fantastic ensemble of actors and actresses, but each persons character and storyline isn't completely developed. I guess that's the problem when your trying to tell 5 or more stories at once.<br/><br/>All in all this is just an O.K. picture. You won't feel any better or worse having watched it by the time the credits roll. If anything you may wish you'd passed on this one. That is how this reviewer felt. Kind of a droll movie that attempts to make an impact- but doesn't really.<br/><br/>It delivers a promising premise... but it could have been much more with a better script and some more character development fleshed out. The acting is definitely solid- but the rest of the film is severely flawed.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is just one hell of an average movie."
"inferno0020","5","4","9","27 September 2005"," Overrating-This movie doesn't even scratch the surface
","I believe that Mr. Haggis tries to make a movie about racism with multi-storyline. It is a successful directing because those story lines are clear. Unfortunateluy, the theme of this movie cannot even hold a candle to this controversial issue in the United States.<br/><br/>Maybe many audiences think this movie discuss every ethnics in LA, including Asians, Middle Easterns,Latinos, African Americans and Caucasian American. However, the whole story focuses on white/black slur, which are old stories without any new purpose and point of view. Compared to American History X which every event is shocking and powerful, the prejudice between white/black is too shallow and childish in Crash.<br/><br/>The plot in story lines of Asians, Middle Easterners and Latinos are awful. This movie only provides us stereotyping characters in those ethnics. Being an Asian American, and knowing many Iran and Latino students, I know that there are a lot of problems about those ethnics. However, Haggis use a illogical way to describe those unrealistic problems. In the ending, I even think he is a racist because he makes Latino as passive characters, Iranians as violent murderers, and Asians as a group of slaves which have no voice. I don't know whether the storyline of Iranians/Latino is based on true event, but the whole story is about those ethnics are distort. <br/><br/>I give it 5 out of 10 for Haggis directing, However the plot itself is bad because I don't think anyone will start accepting other ethnics after watching this movie which shows prejudice against different ethnics. Furthermore, if you are an Asian or a Middle Easterner, I don't advise you to watch this film because this film does not even care about those ethnics."

And it's one thing for people to cross paths, but quite another for all of these ridiculous similarities to keep reoccurring. I can imagine the screenwriter sitting there (with ""Snowdogs"" playing in the background) thinking to himself, ""Wow. I am really writing a clever movie that accurately depicts the ongoing racial struggles contemporary America is experiencing."" Unfortunately, I don't think this guy has stepped out of the suburbs, because his view of inner-city life is laughable. I can't believe Ludicrous was denied his Oscar nomination.

"sthapns247","5","4","9","17 September 2005"," Overrated...
","... Like most of Hollywood's blockbuster attempts at emotion and a ""message."" A message has to be presented to a viewer without patronizing them. Crash patronizes it's audience by focusing far too heavily on the racist and stupid and not enough on the other side. We are presented with a number of different stories and people. All these people are with 100% racist, 100% ignorant, or 100% none of the above. By the end, we are supposed to be believe that all the characters are 100% none of the above, but it is done in an unbelievable way that is too dry and shallow to make a solid point. Of course, if you are naive and easily won over then you will say you love this movie to feel as though you saw ""The art side of a real movie,"" but what you really saw was a pathetic attempt at art that neither distinguished its self nor set any type of standard for future films aside from lowering the bar slightly.<br/><br/>Let me start with the good things, first. The acting was great, for the most part. Most notable Matt Dillon's character; this is by far the best performance I have seen him give. None of the other characters put forth a really note-worthy performance, but of course Don Cheadle's was great. That goes without saying. The direction is well done, with some nice shots, again nothing ""new,"" but very ever little is. The acting is good because of the direction, and movie never looks ""boring."" That said, lets get into the problems.<br/><br/>The movie is too racist for its own good. It plays on pure stereotypes and nothing more. There isn't a single ""good and bad"" character in the bunch, they are either extreme one way or the other and this is not real, at all. The First hour is pure stereotypical garbage. I'm a believer that stereotypes are based in fact, but not so much as that I hate almost everyone who is that type of person. The character played by Ludicrous the one of the most racist characters I have ever seen in a movie and because of that I hated his character. Even when he ""redeems"" himself at the end, I can't say I was glad for him because he didn't do nearly enough to counter his image. I'm not racist at all, so I didn't even see Don Cheadle's character as anything but a person, but I saw Ludicrous as a black thief only because he made such a big deal out of it himself and for this I personally hate the movie. The other stereotypes were spot-on as stereotypes, however, way off in terms as reality. Bullock's sheltered, spoiled, rich wife was too over the top, and then the sudden change at the end was equally exaggerated. The only fairly accurate stereotypes were the Latino and Persian examples, but even those were a little too much. There are many Persian families that come to America to start businesses and know almost nothing about what they are getting into, but the extreme turn he takes seemed a little much. I also know, from experience, that there are many struggling Latino families all over America, so this was probably the only stereotyped character that wasn't massively exaggerated. All Asians, except for a 30 second scene with an insurance agent, were depicted as ignorant, submissive, and could only speak broken English, as well as being bad drivers. These are all stereotypes that not every Asian person falls under nor does one fall under all of them, but this movie makes you think they do. These are oversights that not only ruin a movie, but also lie to a possibly very naive audience and this is not entertainment.<br/><br/>The movie would have been a lot better if it had focused only on the cop stories. Good cop, bad cop. Bad cop ends up saving the day and good cop figures out why bad cop could be as angry as he is. But even then it would have been slightly believable at best. At least I wouldn't have gotten annoyed at the other stereotypes.<br/><br/>The other major problem I have with this movie is the Magnolia rip-off with the snow falling in Los Angeles, just like the frogs at the end of that movie and the cliché ending. The movie almost laughs in your face and makes everything it stood for seem like a joke when the fender bender at the end happens. It is either saying that this type of thing happens all the time and what you saw wasn't profound or great or it's saying that everyone is like the characters in the movie, which is a laughable idea.<br/><br/>Average, misguided movie that's overrated at best and racist garbage at worst."

","This isn't going to be a review as such, rather just my feelings towards this film. This will probably help no one, but I feel I have to say something so I can move on to other, better films.<br/><br/>I can't deny that this movie is well made. It looks good, its well acted (even if Sandra Bullock is too much of a personality and stands out too much), and its one of the rare Hollywood movies out today that has a point of view. But for all the pluses I can't say I like the film or even admire it on anything other than a technical level. I don't like being preached to. I don't like how it feels so carefully constructed and artfully put together that it seems more like a sermon rather than a movie. Sure its premise, simply put, that racism affects us all, and that some can over come it is true, but by the end of the movie I was left feeling unmoved and asking the screen ""yes, and?"" The film seems to be trying to take a high ground and say that it knows better than all of us. Somehow I don't think so.<br/><br/>This movie made me feel the same way that a play called Spinning into Butter made me feel. Spinning into Butter is by Rebecca Gilman and is in the process of being made into a movie. The play deals with racism on a small New England college campus. The center piece of the play is what is essentially a 20 minute monologue that boils racism down so narrowly that it ends up says that if you don't sit next to a person of a different race on a train/subway car, even if its completely empty except for the two of you then you are a racist. Many in the audience were moved by this. And equal number of the audience were left shaking our heads in disbelief since the play essentially says all acts are racial acts. I left the play, as I left the theater showing this movie admiring that they got so much right, but feeling that at the point at which they got on the soap box they lost me and I was never able to fully accept their premise.<br/><br/>As well made and on target as the film is, its derailed by the film makers need to climb onto that soap box. I'm left not wanting to ponder the points out for myself, rather I want desperately to ask them ""yes, and your point was what?"". Actually my feeling is more a happiness that now that I've seen it, I never have to see it again."

"fred-kolb","10","3","6","21 July 2010"," The ""City of Angels"" is shown in a sad and painful light through 36 hours dominated by racism and prejudice.
","Sadness, hatred and bitterness can be found behind every corner in the so-called ""city of angels"", racism dominates everyone's life in one way or the other and people yell and scream at each other simply because of their color and their language. Words are misinterpreted or misunderstood, which leads to conflicts and arguments, sometimes even fatal. This sad, but wonderful movie documents 36 hours in Los Angeles, with more or less average people finding themselves in unusual situations, and often colliding with each other in the most surprising ways. Whether you are a detective, a cop, a district attorney, a movie producer, a locksmith or a car thief, nobody is safe from being pulled into the Maelstrom of hatred and prejudice, which is ever present in L.A. The film is dramatically and intelligently intertwined, which will bring the audience to tears but at the same time is a piece of hope and optimism at the end.<br/><br/>In Los Angeles, racism dominates the interaction between people and over the time of 36 hours many of them encounter it in closer ways than ever before. Detective Graham Waters is working on a case where a racist white cop shot a corrupt black one, and after finding $300,000 in cash in the black cop's car he is almost sure that the dead man was trafficking drugs. But the city, that wants to save face, wants to present the community with a fallen black hero instead of a drug dealer and persuades Waters to drop the case, in exchange for the clearance of his brother's criminal record. Jack Ryan is a racist cop, who after pulling over a couple that performed fellatio, sexually molests the wife under the eyes of her husband and his partner Tom Hanson. The movie director Cameron Thayer and his wife get in a huge fight after being pulled over by Ryan and Thayer's wife accuses him of being worried more about his reputation than her. Rick Cabot, the district attorney, and his wife Jean are attacked by two black thieves and their car is stolen. After that incident, Jean is in constant fear of people that are not of her race, and Rick tries to spin the incident to his advantage, no matter the cost. Daniel Ruiz, a Hispanic locksmith, gives his daughter a necklace, that is supposed to protect her from any danger, even bullets. After a communication problem with the Persian owner of a store, the store is robbed and trashed, and the insurance refuses to pay because of negligence. The owner is desperate and goes after Ruiz and causes a catastrophe to happen.<br/><br/>This movie is a painful mosaic that spreads out over the city and involves numerous people of different ethnicity, languages and social classes. Just one small event, can cause a dangerous chain reaction that will end in casualties. Paul Haggis, in one of the best screenplays of the decade so far, ties up the plot strings convincingly and created a film with a powerful message. There are no good people in Los Angeles, no heroes and no saints, but some have their moments and most of them have their eyes opened by the end of this film. There is no true beginning or end, as it is just a glimpse into an average day for these people, one of many that is filled with sorrow and pain, but occasional happiness. The viewers are pulled in from the very first word on and won't be able to let go until the end credits start rolling. Some of the dialogs are even funny to a certain extent, because they are full of insults and swear words, but their content is so serious, that the smile just won't come in most cases. The language is extremely dirty and includes dozens of ""f-words"" that is because the atmosphere in L.A. was supposed to be as authentic as possible, and it certainly is.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle is very calm and moving as Graham Waters, a detective, who tries everything to get accepted by his mother, and in the end she is always more fond of his criminal younger brother than him. Matt Dillon just blew me away, beginning as the racist asshole, who sexually molests a young woman, to the hero, who risks his one life to pull someone from a burning car. Sandra Bullock as the racist wife of a district attorney has not a lot of screen time, but she is so perfectly unsympathetic that one has to congratulate her for a job well done. Michael Pena, playing the only truly good guy in this film, is extraordinary and some of his scenes will move anyone to tears, especially the one that is shown on the poster, of him letting out a tortured scream as he is holding his young daughter. Ryan Philippe proves that he can be considered one of the best young actors in Hollywood right now, giving a great dramatic performance as the young, naive police officer, who goes through an unfortunate transformation over the 36 hours the film takes place in. Terence Howard's character also changes considerably, from an ambitious, well-worded man, to the aggressive, foul-mouthed one at the end. Thandie Newton as the victim of Ryan's sexual molesting gives a sad and moving performance and her scenes with Dillon are among the best in the movie.<br/><br/>Coincidences shape the lives of the multi-ethnical people in L.A., often for the worse as this movie shows. In any case, Paul Haggis crafted a masterpiece of story-telling that goes deep into the people that have to survive the daily life in a city, where racism is constantly present are where trust is a word nobody has ever heard of. Nobody can prevent the crashes and coincidences of life, but we can make the best of them,instead of blaming each other because of a different skin color or language."

","I watched it all the way through. The cursing really got to me early on, so I turned the volume down but the subititles continued with the nonstop cursing. If you can try to 'ignore' all the vulgar speech which was not necessary but I guess today's audience expects it and finds it 'normal,' then you try and figure out the plot, which there isn't one. OK, so what if a bunch of people's lives intertwine - what is so special about that? That happens every day, pretty much everywhere. And the 'revelations' about racism, corruption, compromise, loneliness, desperation, crime - are not revelations at all. They have always been, and continue on.<br/><br/>I hate racism. I hate cursing. I hate crime and violence. But what I really didn't like about this movie is there was no cohesiveness. It was like someone emptied out a pile of toys from a toy box, and it fell into a huge mess, then you had to separate all the legos from the blocks, all the dolls from the GI Joes and army men, and it took forever. When you were done, you had these separate piles and threw them all back into the toy box. It was a waste of my time, and a waste of perfectly good actors' talents.<br/><br/>Too bad. Awful. I gave it a 2 because the actors were great. The story was a terrible nightmare."

","This is such a great film I do not understand why ts so unlikable if you put attention to how much effort went into this. It is just amazing.<br/><br/>They way the story is told is great, the actors are great but what I love the most is the symbolism of the crosses used throughout the film, the way the cinematographer works. The camera is always shooting into the light so we get the feel that we are in Los Angeles. In Los Angeles we are always squinting. There is also the scene with Shaun Toub and Michael Pena behind them are reindeer. This shows how it is Christmas time, there are other examples of this throughout the film. Christmas is supposed to be about love and affection and the total opposite thing is going on. It so great how it is done. There is a shot in this scene where Ashlyn Sanchez walks out the door to save Pena at that moment where the door is opened there is a cross. Which took me a while to see when I saw that I was speechless just amazing. Another shot which I found amazing when when Shaun Toub was standing there all by himself. Well behind him was the American flag. Just so great. There are lots of more examples like this, that are so great. I find this film to be great and well if you do not I do not agree with you...sorry...just how I feel. Amazing Film once again."

","Its lack of narrative subtlety prohibits Crash being a truly great film; there are great performances and breathtakingly captured scenes, however, the scriptwriter's immense confidence, in an admittedly clever concept (however crudely executed), appears to be to blame for the contrived feeling of the resulting film.<br/><br/>The over simplistic narrative unnecessarily highlights the intentions of the filmmakers and makes it feel like a medium for crudely constructed and (somewhat paradoxically) vague ideology making it hard to focus on the story rather than the story telling. Crash is based on a challenging concept that was sadly underdeveloped (resulting in a slightly heavy-handed and a clichéd script) but otherwise very well made."

","This film is so horrible, that from the first minute of watching it, I knew what was happening and will happen. The point was to squeeze as much racism and personalities into 100 minutes as possible. Apparently this city's population is 10 people, who keep running into each other a thousand times a day for no reason. The white cop has a black partner, who is married to a Chinese woman, who is best friends with a hispanic woman. Wow, I get it, setting up for racism. Let's also spend 1/2 hour talking about the protective cloak, which obviously will come into play in the most predictable way possible. And start random, unbelievable arguments just to lead up to violence. Everything is conveniently placed and phrased, so the audience doesn't get lost in this extra simple script. The characters are way too unrealistic and undeveloped. I can't tell you a single character's name or anything about them. So much talent wasted on this horrible mess.<br/><br/>I can go on an on, but the sad truth is that Matt Dilon and Terrence Howard are actually amazing actors, and if this was a better script, they would have been that much more amazing.<br/><br/>Obviously if you want to win an Oscar, here is the formula. A retarded gay racist kid that gets abused, works hard, and at the end learns his lesson. Done, you'll get an Oscar.<br/><br/>Go rent Magnolia, if you want to see good actors act out a good script."

","i rarely pan anything but i just have to say that if one truly wants to study the dumbing-down of America, look no further than this piece of tripe. ""crash"" pretends to be some searing indictment of race in this country and just fails horribly at it. to begin with, it is a none too subtle rip-off of ""magnolia"", ""traffic"", and several other better-made films and it doesn't even steal from them all that well. there are at least four too many characters here, none of which are developed enough for you to care deeply about any of them, including the better-known players. shoddy b-list acting from b-list actors here, let's be honest. don cheadle probably should have known better, but i'm sure he was well compensated for his work. but perhaps the worst thing about this train wreck of a film is that the overwrought and all too convenient plot simply goes nowhere and does nothing. the entire point of using this type of storytellling is to take the magic realism that you have created in order to make some grand statement about your chosen subject and it fails to do even that. what's the point here? that racism is alive and well? that there is a class system? that America is essentially unjust? ummm....no duh? most people figure that out somewhere around the seventh grade. it's called capitalism. i mean, what is going on here? but perhaps the most depressing thing about ""crash"" is how a film like this can now be hailed as visionary in today's society. FINGERS will be pointed! EARNEST DIALOGUES will be opened! GREAT DEBATES will rage! i mean, wtf? have we become so blinded and desensitized and beaten over the head with the constant idiocy in this country (particularly in our arts and letters) that a film like ""crash"" is now considered high art? wake up people. it's nothing more than pop psychology. it's dramedy. it's dr. phil. it's tight easy answers dressed up in sugary hallmark sentiment. most of all, it's crap. i know it and deep down so do you. what happened to artistic conscience? to those of you that should know better but are still falling all over yourself about this picture (and you know who you are), i would just like to ask you what happened to standing by the courage of your convictions or even having any kind of conviction at all about ANYTHING? i mean, #55 ALL-TIME????????? are you kidding me with this? ""crash"" is the very worst kind of film making, simply because it's pretending to be something it's not. ""crash"" telegraphed its intentions right from the get go. underneath all of the gloss and artifice and putting on of airs, ""crash"" is actually much closer to a film like ""training day"", another movie that could have been said so much more than it did. but at least ""training day"" wasn't screwing with its audience, selling them something other than what they paid for. to be fair, ""crash"" is pretty to look at, but not much more. it's a gauzy pig wrapped in velvet and gussied up with all the bells and whistles that you would expect, but it's a pig nonetheless. it's ""urban realism"" for the Saturday night date set. i could have just stayed home and watched music videos, so shallow and surface-y do i find the artistic statement presented here. and before you call foul, please know that i am of a minority background and that i do indeed live in a major urban center. i hate feeling that i have to provide a DISCLAIMER when stating my opinion on a film, but it feels like this is EXACTLY the case, so openly and irresponsibly does ""crash"" play the race card. how ironic. and rarely does a movie provoke such a visceral response from me either and usually when it does, it's because it's GOOD and i just haven't realized it yet. i can't tell you just how much that's not the case here. sorry."

"mpofarrell","4","7","20","21 May 2005"," Totalled
","Watching writer-director Paul Haggis' new film ""Crash"", I couldn't help thinking about another, much better film with a similar interlocking storyline. That was ""Amores Perros"" (2001), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's gritty, no-holds-barred meditation on the lives of some fictional citizens in modern day Mexico City. Although the story was an obvious set-up, with a terrible car crash at its center and how that crash affected the lives of several disparate characters, the movie managed to be engrossing and utterly believable in its depiction of varying social castes in a huge metropolis. The film had the feel of a documentary and was so epic-sized in depicting the teeming life of a city that it managed to triumph over the screenplay's contrivances.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a whole other story. Although I can admire the intentions of its creator and the admirable work of a talented cast, the movie didn't work for me on any level. An ambitious contemporary parable about the need for racial tolerance and understanding, ""Crash"" offers up a nearly endless series of angry rants and speeches by characters who literally collide into each other on the highway or verbally clash in elegant homes, ""mom and pop"" grocery stores or utilitarian HMO offices. The movie is a frustrating experience because the acting by the entire cast is superb and there are several powerfully dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser are perfect as a wealthy suburbanite couple obsessed with image. In fact Bullock has never been better, commanding the screen as a spoiled district attorney's wife whose prejudices erupt when her SUV is hijacked by two young black men. Matt Dillon is equally impressive as a bigoted LAPD cop who sexually harasses a woman whose car he has pulled over, only to attempt to save the same women in a horrific car accident the next day. A hotheaded Iranian store owner unjustly berates a Mexican American locksmith for not fixing the door to his liking after the store has been broken into and burglarized the night before. All these story elements (and several others) come to a dramatic conclusion that is at once operatic as it is mechanical. The fine acting, the grainy, unvarnished cinematography, the taut editing and a foreboding, mournful score can't compensate for the fact that ""Crash"" is an exercise in manipulation. Paul Haggis allows his characters to preach to the choir instead of giving them a narrative that relies less on shouting and coincidence and more on credible storytelling techniques."

","It's absolutely astounding that this picture won ANY awards. This self-serving, self-righteous, contrived piece of crap served as nothing more than a vehicle for Hollywood to 'pat itself on the back' for seeming to address long-standing racial issues. I am convinced that ANYONE who liked this movie either works in Hollywood, or is a blithering IDIOT with a simplistic outlook on life. It was so pretentious and contrived I don't know where to start. Sandra Bullock was horrible and totally unconvincing as a racist, angry wife. Ludicrous was ludicrous, basically RAMMING DOWN OUR THROATS the racist realities of life, as if the audience was not smart enough to recognize racism without his long-winded speeches. Everybody was bad, even Don Cheadle. There were just too many high-priced, over-exposed actors in the movie for it to be credible. Unknowns would have been the way to go, more believable. I mean, I was insulted at the OVERT nature of the subject matter, as if we are too stupid to realize what's going on without the Heavy Hand of the studio. I felt NO EMOTION from any of the actors, nor did I feel sorry for any of them or their 'plight'. Well, ""plight"" is used loosely, because most of the characters were rich, privileged, famous or in authority, even the blacks. And the sunny 85 degree weather of California did nothing to elicit sorrow. In other words, all involved pretty much 'had it made'. Watching those Hollywood puppet-heads congratulate themselves ad-nauseum on TV was sickening. This movie was made FOR Hollywood BY Hollywood, just to say, ""hey, were GREAT!"". This movie did NOTHING for race relations, except put it back a few years. With all the Famine, Terrorism, Aids, Gangs, Disease, Racism, Crime etc, Hollywood and it's Actors should absolutely be ashamed of themselves for turning out this self-serving drivel. Two words for Hollywood, 'Foreign Films'."

","In the Film ""Crash"", movie viewers are challenged to remain ambivalent while following the life line of a city afloat in a sea of racial tensions. The story begins with a touching philosophical summery of modern life in the large metropolis of America. Don Cheadle, in what is likely to become a classic role for him, gives a most inspiring performance as a Los Angeles policeman in search of meaning. In his role as an investigative police detective, he searches for the murderer of his brother and a victim of a gunshot shooting. While he makes his rounds of the city, he attempts to hold his family together while all around him, other people are struggling with theirs. Each life is laced with personal stereotypical barriers which prompts others to collide with them. Each suffers through their own brand of racial bigotry and in turn allows the viewer to see themselves in this fascinating mirror of life. Memorable performances from Matt Ryan, Billy Gallo, and Ryan Phillippe as Hanson, highlight this amazing collection of stories. After watching this film, it's little wonder why it was chosen as Picture of the Year. ****"

","This is probably the best film I have seen in a cinema for a good number of years. The script is what I would call close to perfect, with the different story lines all developing in meaning and concluding together into one large important message. Some moments of this film made me laugh, with the two car thieves delivering some fantastic lines. Some moments made me cry, with Don Cheadle's character painfully losing his long lost little brother. And some moments kept me on the edge of my seat, the intense scene with Matt Dillon saving the woman from the burning car wreckage is just unforgettable. The wide diversity of characters is what makes this film so enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>The underlining message echoing through the film is the effects of racism on the American public, and the attitudes people hold against each other. The film delivers the message in an effective manner, with the ending beautifully rounding off each character's developments and their self realisation. The films basically shows how despite people realising the problem of racism, it is one problem they just won't learn from. The Stereophonics song, Maybe Tomorrow, is strangely ironic in painting the film's final point.<br/><br/>Out of the whole superb cast Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon stand out clearly. Don Cheadle playing the restless cop with a heavy heart for his mother; constantly trying to look out for his brother. And Matt Dillon as the racist cop; who after cowardly abusing a coloured women sexually, seems to learn the most about himself through the events of the film. The resistance and guilt he finds, helps him to finally learn the error of his ways. The sheer complexity and diversity of the storyline and acting will definitely keep you watching until the end and illustrate to you why this film will be remembered."

I think you could watch this movie ten times and come up with ten different conclusions! In short, go see this movie... again. I have never been to see the same movie at the cinema twice, but I may to see Crash again. Simply superb! I read a lot of people saying on this forum that Brendan fraser was poor, he was excellent. He is type cast as a funny hunk actor, in this movie he was mis-cast on purpose, or was he? For my money, he was excellent as an ill at ease DA, walking a tightrope. Sandra Bullock was a little under par but her outrage and pain was brilliantly acted. I think just about everyone who saw this movie and understood its underlying plot, could at least try to compare themselves to at least one of the characters and what emotion they were portraying. Mine was Sandra Bullock, angry for no reason and frustrated because of such. Myself, being disabled its so easy to get mad at the world, though ignorance, I felt this in Sandra's acting with the way she showed her interpretation of the script, as if life imitating art.

All of these stories are much too complicated to be told in under two hours. It's almost like this is the outline to a film. You would think that great actors, powerful themes and an enthusiastic director would make for a fine film. But it misses the mark in spite of the fine acting. The breath is literally squeezed out of most of the stories - not enough time to tell them. And with the clock ticking, Haggis resorts to gimmicks. Michael Pena and Dashon Howard stand out in this very fine cast. Paul Haggis has the makings of a storyteller, but...

However, for me it was an example of a movie that tried too hard. The direction was efficient and enthusiastic enough, but in the process Crash also has some quite manipulative story-telling that goes off the boil towards the end, an overly-didactic tone, uneven pacing, annoying characters(too many characters too), generic music and some clumsy scripting.

As has been widely stated in the previous reviews: 'Crash' is VERY poor quality, primarily because of the screenplay. It lacks intelligence and finesse, has unformed and unbelievable characters, an over reliance on coincidence (fine in a pulp thriller but not in a 'serious' piece) and treats its audience like dullards.

Far from being groundbreaking, this appeared to be satire and a collection of actors who don't really know what true commentary on ethnic and racial issues means. <br/><br/>What was even more ridiculous was how full of itself the film is; the director blabbering on and on about how marvelous it was that everyone worked for reduced pay, and how shocked they are that the thing got off the ground... pure Hollywood PR crap. Packed full of these top stars, most of whom could easily afford to work for nothing, let alone 'reduced pay,' it fits in perfectly with public consumption and was ready made for box office success.<br/><br/>This film will go down in history as the movie that was safer to award than the groundbreaking ""Brokeback Mountain."""
"ghaliberation","5","4","10","26 March 2006"," Watch it for its faults
","""Crash"" is about a set of different people in different contexts doling out and receiving racial discrimination. The first half deals with the crime, the second with the reformation. An otherwise caring police officer (who takes care of his ailing father in his old age) is a perverted racist. An Iranian who runs a shop and who is very sensitive to attacks on his wife and daughter, thinks nothing of suspecting a young black mechanic of cheating on his job. The movie's characters are far too properly representative to be random (mix of young/ old, black/ brown/ white, large/ small etc etc) and undergo experiences which are far too in-your-face to ring true. Also, ridden with coincidences (like the same officer Matt Dillon rescuing the black damsel in distress, the same black customer service rep at the insurance company meeting Matt Dillon when he comes over to their office etc) looks like this movie is almost made into a parable with a moral to take home. The movie lacks subtlety and I, for one, fail to understand how it won the ""Best Movie"" at the Oscars. Watch it for its faults, but don't expect this movie to change your world view."
"nkarani","8","4","10","7 March 2006"," I have seen two Oscar favorites so far, and my own vote goes to Crash.
","Brokeback Mountain, in spite of being a gay-themed film, did not move me the way Crash does.<br/><br/>I can think of several possible reasons for this --other than the intrinsic merits of these films. In random order: The accents (I think I did not understand one-third of the dialogue) in BM, its slow pace, and the fact that I have seen enough closeted men up-close so that I look at most of them with a clinical detachment.<br/><br/>Crash is also a tension-filled drama compared to BM's dry love story. The former leaves you with some hope, while BM leaves me, as a gay man, neither seething with anger at the homophobia (too subtle) nor does it make me cry buckets. I am not a fan of violence in film but here it was too fleeting to either hurt or outrage me (the way I was outraged by the violation of a woman's body in Crash). I would prefer the docu on the Matthew Shepard case instead.<br/><br/>To me Crash is not just about racial prejudice but also a comment on America's gun culture. I have no knowledge about the situation in the States, but I know that enough discrimination exists on the individual level and there is enough violence involving guns to make them alive issues--they may disappear from the public radar but they do not go away. BM's flag for the gay issue is too underplayed for my liking.<br/><br/>In India, coincidentally, at this time some cases of shootings are in the spotlight again, though unfortunately I am yet to see any debate around gun control. I am of course referring to the cases of Jessica Lal, Priyadarshini Matoo and now the latest Meher Bhargava case.<br/><br/>It's time lawmakers and police officials made it more difficult for people to posses firearms rather than making it more tough to run places of entertainment. Or making it a crime for two men to love each other."

","I never expected this movie to be as good as it was. I didn't understand why the cover of the DVD had twelve names, but it makes sense after you watch the movie; they are all important to the movie and they all have the same amount of time on screen. This is the first movie I have ever seen with TWELVE main characters.<br/><br/>This movie is very harsh, dealing with racism in L.A., life in L.A., crimes that happen everyday, and the deaths that break the hearts of its residents. The Director and producers crammed all of that into one day, realistically. All of the characters where eventually connected with each other, and the way they were, was very shocking.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is one of the main characters and in my opinion this is one of the best, if not the best, movies she has ever been a part of, and to top that off this is the hottest she's ever been.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle is not my favorite actor but his role in this movie was not as annoying as I have seen, in others characters he has played, and again I also think this is one of his best roles, if not the best.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon is the most likable rude, perverted, racist cop I have ever seen, he makes it clear early on that he is racist, yet you feel a sense of compasion because he feels bad afterwards. This is the first time I've ever seen any of his work, but I can say this guy is not bad, at all.<br/><br/>Jennifer Esposito's role I'm finding hard to recall, but she is a very likable person and the girlfriend of Cheadle(In the movie).<br/><br/>William Fichtner's role is some of his best work even though he has a really small part, although the only other work of his that I know of is his role in the ABC television show ""Invasion"", where he plays a very unlikeable sheriff.<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser also has a small part in this film, a very different character which is a lot more serious than his role in ""Bedazzled""(A comedy). It's fairly good for a comedic-to-serious role transition.<br/><br/>Terrence Howard is a very good actor in ""Crash"" he plays a black man who seems to be in a way in denial of who he is, he finds it very shameful and degrading to the black image when fellow blacks commit crimes. His role is powerful, and at times it might make you fell like reaching into the screen and slapping him.<br/><br/>Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges is surprisingly a good actor. In the beginning he might make you believe that he is one person when he's really a stereotypical image of a black man from the eyes of those ""white folks"" who fall victim of his and Larenz Tate's rath's, but after it happens it is kind of hard to feel sorry for ""one"" of their victims, who might just be a bit bias against minorities.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton's line of events and situations are astonishing and touching. Her role as well as every other cast members roles are a very big contribution to this movie, no matter how big or how small.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillipe, this is the first role I've ever seen him in, his part just might be the most shocking or surprising of the film.<br/><br/>Michael PeÃ±a is a very talented actor; his role along with his film daughter's just might be the most ""touching"" of the film. Together they are amazing. His daughter in the film is adorable and there are parts of their roles combined that make you feel a ""Heart Ache"" a good one, it's very moving, and I'm a very proud to share a last name with this talented man.<br/><br/>""Crash"" just might make your emotions ""Crash"" because for sure; they'll be speeding throughout your veins, across the surface of your heart (maybe deeper), and if you can relate or identify with any of these characters your emotions will swim through your soul. Possibly one of the best movies ""ever"", and yes I mean this, destined to become a classic. I give it two thumbs up, way up, if I had any more they'd all be pointing towards the sky."

A great group of actors done a great job.Until Sandra Bullock it's OK, but Don Cheadle,Matt Damon,Thadie Newton,and the guy that fix keys,sorry i didn't know his name,are in the mood for acting.

I mean, I think American viewers are tired of Canadians telling them what they are."" Paul Haggis: ""But don't you see? This doesn't matter. All that matters is what the Academy will say."" Isn't it true though? Another Hollywood ""inspiring"" film that has no connection with American's? Again we are to settle with a film that misses on so many levels.<br/><br/>Within the first half-hour it is obvious that every single white character in this movie is a bigot. This movie is one sided on so many levels I couldn't even keep track. The stereotypes used in this film are so exaggerated I lost all accountability with whatever the message the director was trying to portray.<br/><br/>Exactly what is this film trying to show? Is it that after 40 years of civil rights we are worse off now that when we were when we started? Is it that every white person has some degree of prejudice whether they know it or not? In this film I couldn't help to notice how the white racial innuendos aimed at blacks are serious and ignorant, but the black racial comments aimed at whites are jokes and punch lines. Example: Matt Dillon entire dialog vs. the conversation between the two black car jackers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this movie enraged me more than enlightened me. Seeing that ""Hollywierd"" shows my race as a bunch of brainless, Klan, bullies couldn't help but turn me off to any more garbage this director has to dish.<br/><br/>If you must, watch.

The movie is set against the vibrant yet sinister backdrop of Los Angeles where people of every possible race pit their lives against each other in the pursuit of a living. The film deals with the complex and completely believable relationships between a host of credible and finely crafted characters and manages to paint a canvas larger than the sum of its parts. In the end the film leaves you to make your own conclusions and makes you realise that racism is just one facet of the complex lives of its characters. There is simply no simple answer to a problem that is mindbogglingly difficult to understand. Bravo!"

","This movie really makes you examine the way you view and judge others around you. Many people are of a different ethnicity from you or are of a different religious persuasion. Sadly, this often influences our attitudes and behaviors towards them. The movie is well-written and the cinematography really adds to the ambiance and feel of the movie. The characters all experience their own situations where stereotypes and biases influence the way they handle these situations. All the characters come to a revelation in their own experiences and are challenged to correct their way of thinking or otherwise confront their own character flaws. While it seems the movie is a collection of unrelated events at first, it soon becomes clear that they are all interconnected somehow. This is much the same case in real life, where our actions have a ripple effect in our society. I highly recommend this movie. It is a ""must view"" for those prone to racism, class discrimination, or intolerance in general."

","I can describe this movie in only two words: BEST PICTURE.<br/><br/>Since IMDb required a minimum of 10 lines in order to post a comment, I'll have to elaborate, but those two words sum up my feelings...<br/><br/>The cast was perfect. The story was original and moving. The directing reflected a sensibility and sensitivity that is rare in cinema. The film dealt with serious social issues with a deft touch not often seen in Hollywood. All the elements fell into place beautifully. I'm sure some hot-shot film buff will come along and talk about ""holes"" in the story or some mundane issue like poor continuity or something -- because there's always that guy who likes to act like he knows something the rest of us don't -- but I can say that my first impression, having just watched the film, is that ""Crash"" is the best picture I've seen this year, hands down. And that's saying something. <br/><br/>Oscar, if you haven't already seen it, go out right now and buy the DVD."

","Consider every stereotype and negative thought you have had about someone of another race or ethnicity. Remember any time you have allowed those thoughts to actually form words that come out of your mouth. Then watch this movie. Sometimes you will be stunned into silence, other times you will laugh out loud because in your mind, you think ""it's just so true"" or ""I can't believe they just said that"". This movie will stretch you to look deep inside and search for where your prejudice lies, where your fears are, and why they exist. Everyone is shaped by their interactions with others, good or bad, rich or poor, young or old. This movie reminds you that everyone is human, everyone makes mistakes, and everyone can be redeemed, no matter what country you were born in or what color your skin is. This movie also reminds you that the innocent often times are the victims and that the victims can suddenly turn into the perpetrator. It spins and weaves an amazing story about the lives of very different people living very different lives, yet they all have their families and their jobs and after all is said and done, they are all people with feelings and tragedy and hope and love. Truly an amazing film that obviously has caused a great deal of controversy. Kudos to Don Cheadle and Terrance Howard, who are brilliant, and to Sandra Bullock for taking a roll that is rather small but so out of character for her, and she is very convincing. Micheal Pena is wonderful as a hard working man trying to do right for his family. And this Ludicrous fellow, wow. This is a must see."

","Crash shows all sides of human nature. In life, even when one is involved with friends, partners and siblings, it's difficult to know where one stands. I feel that Crash shows as many variations about human life as possible; prejudice, attitudes, feelings and basic life situations. Then, Paul Haggis shows the inter-relationship between each character with another. I think this is more than a cleverly directed and well written piece of work. Although, there is a meeting of characters, each individual shows a part of us that exists. All the performances are amazing despite this, the characters stand strongly intrinsically. If there is one film you see this year, it has to be Crash."

Just when the character would be fully developed in other movies, an underlying attribute or personality trait or quirk of fate would just shake this movies world up a bit. A nice change of pace from the regular cookie cutter movie, but then again maybe not. Maybe this movie was just cut from a bigger broader cookie cutter.

Using an ensemble cast and a small timeframe, ""Crash"" points out the underlying unease of emotional turmoil that lies just below the surface of our every day existence in a post 9/11 United States. Many of us are not even aware of the extent of this fear until something happens that allows our thinly veiled insecurities and bigotries to come ""boiling"" to the surface. This movie should be required viewing for ALL Americans...and especially those that tend to identify more with the republican party. Maybe this movie will allow someone to see the pain and suffering that comes from fear and bigotry."
"markymnstr","10","4","10","20 June 2005"," The Truth Hurts Only When It Should!
","Paul Haggis pulls back the veil of hypocrisy in an effort to reveal that all species human, regardless of their class, status or skin hue possess varied levels of racism that almost always seem to find their way to the surface in times of crisis.<br/><br/>The movie pulls no punches, but I for one, though at times felt shaken up never felt beaten up. At times felt saddened, but never felt abandoned. If Haggis was preaching, it wasn't brimstone and hellfire, and it certainly wasn't to the choir. It was more like a modern book of ""Revelations,"" and either you get it or you don't! Painful? Sometimes. But almost always poignant and often surprisingly funny, Haggis makes certain no one escapes his magnifying glass. At times the malevolence that spews from the lips of Sandra Bullock (The DAs wife) or Shaun Toub (The Persian shop owner) is brutal and is deliberately exceedingly uncomfortable. But for Haggis it's like a detox program on the road to recovery.<br/><br/>The tapestry is woven with purpose and coincidence that may preach and pound but it never hems or haws or equivocates. It's the kind of film that tries to prove that an audience 'can handle the truth' (sorry Jack!).<br/><br/>L.A. is a cultural melting pot and serves perfectly as an authentic backdrop for the movie's message and tone. Here Haggis paints a cinematic mural of his City of Angels. A city of hate, hope and redemption.<br/><br/>In my opinion, ""Crash"" is never bleak, just refreshingly honest. It's funny, sad, poignant and finally, in its own way...healing."

The whole cast is top notch with top notch performances. Paul Haggis has created a masterpiece that I will remember for a long time. It brings you laughs, tears, and raises a lot of eyebrows. The ""Best in Show Male"" has to be the amazing Matt Dillon who brings the character of a racist police officer with a dying father to life. Never before have I seen a more real, true performance. Sandra Bullock takes a break from her ""cutesy"" girl roles for a some strong supporting performance. Her screen time is minimal but every time she is on screen you find yourself engulfed in her eyes. Terrence Howard is the breakout star of the year who carries many scenes on his bare shoulders. He shows you so many emotions with a tear falling down his face. Michael Pena is the most likable character of the movie and the one I sympathized with the most. He's too unknown to garner Oscar attention but we should be seeing him in the future. Don Cheadle gives a pretty decent performance but not as good as last years Hotel Rwanda. And last but certainly not least is Thandie Newton who's raw intensity gives the viewer a shutter. After last years bomb the Chronicles of Riddick she returns with a force to be reckoned with come Oscar time. I would love to see both Bullock and Newton nominated like McDormand and Hudson back in 2001 but that's very rare. The rest of the cast is great but it was just these few that stood out. Recommended as the great American film of the year."

","I have never ever seen a real movie like this. This hits you like a religious experience. At first, the race dialog seems ripped from the Spike Lee preaching book but the dialog has purpose, and that purpose is realized when the characters CRASH into one another. You just sympathize and emote and the last hour is just packed with heartbreakingly beautiful scenes. The scene between Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton is just so kinetic and intense and the scene with the Persian shopkeeper and the Latino locksmith was INCREDIBLE. If I was in church that would have brought me to my knees. That connection between people and pain and that silence was just so........real. The vibrancy is built from the vulnerability of the characters and their inability to truly change the situation but the worth of their questioning is noted. Don Cheadle bristles like a man on fire throughout this movie. You just vibe and you vibe and you vibe. No characters are given quarter. Ludicrous' idealistic robber is shown for his brilliance and his ignorance. That is what this is about. It is about everyone being imperfect and how perspective is so important to the situation. The characters CRASH and what remains is just so real to what humanity is that I think that Haggis is some kind of prophet ahead of his time. America is not ready for such an honest piece of art."

That L.A. is a microcosm for 2005 America? That this top-notch cast thought they were buying into a lot more than they got? Well, yeah to all.

"bwilkening","2","5","14","5 June 2006"," Superficial examination of race relations
","I really don't understand how so many people seem to think that this movie has contributed meaningfully to the national dialog on race relations. Reading some of the positive reviews from critics and viewers, you would think that there have been NO other movies dealing with race in recent American cinematic history. I would recommend that people check out some of Spike Lee's early films, like Do the Right Thing, if they are looking for searing, realistic examinations of this sensitive subject. Even the seriously flawed American History X offered a more penetrating look at racial prejudice.<br/><br/>Where to begin with the problems that I had with this movie? First, there is the simple fact that this movie offers no fresh perspective on race. The conversations between the two young black men are supposed to provide insight on what it is like to be a young black man in America and on what the root problems facing the African American community are. Instead, everything that they say has been covered more effectively in other films. We learn that white women often avert there eyes away from young black men on the street. We hear two different perspectives on the role of rap music and on the dearth of respected leaders in the African American community. Apparently, black people are of two different opinions about the use by blacks of the N-word. Who would've known? We then learn that Middle Easterners often face discrimination from those who regard everybody from the region as terrorists. These scenes seem blatantly designed to appeal to those who have never thought about these issues in their lives. Geez, it really IS hard to be a young black man these days. I never thought about that! Geez, it really would suck to deal with ignorant Americans who think Arabs and Persians are all the same. I never realized that non-Arabs are often mistaken as being Arab! If this movie does succeed in providing insight to those who have never thought about these issues before, then more power to it, just don't expect to find anything insightful here if you do not fit into this category.<br/><br/>Movies like Do the Right Thing treat race as a subtle sentiment that lurks beneath the surface of people's everyday exteriors. People may hold prejudices against other groups, but these prejudices might not explode to the surface except under extreme circumstances (like police brutality against African Americans, for instance, or when there is a mob mentality effect). Not so in Crash. Race is never far from the surface, in fact, it seems to be the only factor that enters into people's calculus in their interactions with members of other races. The first part of this movie basically shows people launching into racial tirades in reaction to the most trivial provocations. When an Asian woman and a Latino woman are involved in a minor crash, what do they do? Examine each other's cars to assess the damage and exchange insurance info? Hell no! They immediately unleash a slew of racial invective. There are numerous scenes like this that just seem designed to bang us over the head with the message we are all racists.<br/><br/>Other people have already addressed some of the other weaknesses of the movie. One other thing that bothered me was the fate of the two characters who actually made concerted efforts to transcend the limits of the race-centric mindset. The Ryan Philipe and Larenz Tate characters seemed to try think outside the racial box, but their interaction led to the most tragic outcome of all the characters. So apparently, even when a white guy and a black guy who eschew the prejudices that their respective communities hold about the others' race TRY to find common ground and break down racial barriers, they can't succeed. Okay, so what's the overall message?"

For those wondering how this thing could have won best film, here are a few clues: 1) white racist cop character is heroic, 2) unshaven Arab-looking character shoots gun at child, 3) Asian female and black (fat) female characters are shrieking shrews and bad drivers. I could go on but the simple fact is that this is a film about race for racists (there's even the ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" white-politician-making-hero-of-dead-black-criminal angle, although Haggis' script has no trace of Tom Wolfe's art and verisimilitude).<br/><br/>There is, in fact, nothing in the film itself (the way the actors talk and act) that has anything to do with modern, real life America. The fact that this film won the top award from the Academy does, however, speak volumes about where we are at as a society and the news isn't good. If anything should put the lie to the notion that Hollywood is a left-wing enclave, the Academy's elevation of this aggressively reactionary film should do it, but it probably won't."

","Know who you are and you do not have a clue ""Crash"" is a film that, in my opinion, is surrounded by controversy for some (including me included) is a great movie, for others nothing more than a pamphlet and easy moralizing. In my opinion deserved the Oscar it won. <br/><br/>Well we have a large number of stories carried out by persons of any race, class, ethnicity, etc ... and every one of these characters face in their own skin racism, one way or another. These stories are spun well and have a great asset to you and they are incredibly realistic, you think that might happen in reality, those characters and the situations you can find on the street, is one of the most positive aspects of film credibility. <br/><br/>The dialogs of the film are excellent, where pearls are released as you know who you are and you do not have any idea ""some of these dialogs expel anger, dissatisfaction, hatred ... the characters (with a great soundtrack) really hard and emotional, but although abused terms like black, Chinese... Yet the script is excellent. It looks perfect to get people where they can, both as good as in evil, with the sole aim to survive in a city like LA where it is impossible not to clash. <br/><br/>If we add a unique script, direction and effective interpretations about as powerful as the entire cast, which must be highlighted to Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle (both are always perfect) Sandra Bullock and Ryan Phillippe (surprising) and Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard, the result is a great film, realistic, emotional, sincere and credible, even though in its final part the director and screenwriter who tend towards an end is probably not adequate. Very, very useful."
"restin_him","1","3","7","4 October 2008"," A message that is easy to ignore
","Crash is a film that was supposed a great commentary on race relations in our country. This was stated as being a film that made us seriously look at who we were really like on the inside challenging our internal perceptions.<br/><br/>The story follows several characters through out a disturbing group of events all involving racially charged situations. We get everything from a racist perverted cop, a clean young self righteous cop, yuppie victims of a break in, a mixed race couple in which one is racist against the others race, and a few more. The actors do a very good job but fall victim to an overloaded film. It is hard to find time to care for may of these characters plights when there is no time to really get to know them. The best example is when there is an attempt to make us sympathize with the racist cop. We have seen several instances of his disgusting behavior and that is it when suddenly we get a sob story about his father. While this is not a bad concept it is meaningless in this film because we know nothing of this character except that he is a jerk and the sudden family story seems cheap and fake, especially when it is the one and only time we hear it or see this personal weakness. most the other stories follow suit making the film a series of cheap and emotionless shock spots.<br/><br/>This leads into the greatest flaw with this film. I have lived in many different places in the USA. Each has its own levels and different types of racism that appears at times. The one true constant however is the deep and subtle racism that effects each place. Individuals are not double faced but they are shadow minded not intending or even holding anything evil but allowing this shadow of image to impact them mildly. This shadowed racism is what infects most of America and when many are confronted on it they are shocked at what they were not even aware of.<br/><br/>Crash wished to confront people with its multiple stories. The failure comes in that each situation is over the top. Each story presents us with a situation which easily disgusts us and makes us see how clearly wrong the act is. As I listened to others after the movie had ended most were saying how they could never imagine being like the characters they had just seen. It is to easy for the average person to walk away from this film saying ""Wow, I am so glad I am not like that"" because the average person is not like that.<br/><br/>Crash needed to follow two specific people involved in a confrontation of the subtle issues each of us face not the extremes that shock us. The shock must come from the realization that I am just like this person who I have learned holds things they never knew.<br/><br/>Crash is a failure and cheap stylized social commentary. It is sad that so many hold this film as a great commentary on racism. If anything this film continues to allow people to ignore what they might be holding close and hidden."
"dougdodge","5","3","7","1 December 2007"," Very dated stereotypes...
","This film was horribly heavy-handed with plenty of the typical old-fashioned stereotypes to go around. Many directors believe situations and characters have to be played and portrayed off of the scale to get their agenda across to the audience. This is a perfect example. This film would have been much more realistic and believable had it been set in any time period before the 1970s. Ideally, this would have made a great film to have been set in the 1960s or the '50s. With the talent and performances in this picture, I would have then rated it an easy 8 or maybe a 9. But, because of the director's treatment of racism, it was hard to swallow as legitimate just because it was way over the top. Sure, there are still race and class bigots and issues out there, but they are a little more subdued in this day and age due to a cultural zero tolerance attitude towards racism. This is one of those films where I hear the usual ""could have been much better"" ringing in my ears. Great acting, good screenplay, mediocre (at best) direction. Too bad. Chalk this up as ANOTHER undeserving Oscar winner, and there have been a few in the last twenty years. Not that an Academy Award means anything anyway!"

","I think the first thing I need to mention are my preconceptions before first seeing this movie. I do this as I think your view of a movie can be affected by your preconceptions. For example I am sure I do not rate Gladiator as highly as it deserves due to the fact I caught it late on DVD after I had heard and read people raving on about how great it was, I was disappointed at least partially due to my expectations being overly high.<br/><br/>With Crash however although I did not catch it until after it had won the Oscar I was not convinced it was going to be a great movie as I was indifferent about the cast and on reading the cover I could see it looked like one of those movies which would either work or just be an incoherent mess. Besides ""Gladiator"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" had won Oscars in recent years  both of which I do not rate that highly! I was slightly worried by the opening scene, it features Cheadle (probably the actor involved I rated highest before seeing this movie) but seemed to contain awkward dialogue, was not particularly visually inspiring and bottom line just failed to grab me. However the scene was just a setup scene out of context as the movie quickly moves into the true first act set a day before within the time line of the story.<br/><br/>The story quickly progresses to show various characters from different walks of life within the city of Los Angeles living through the previous 24 hours. All of the stories involve the subject of racism and all end up being intermingled in the style of previous films such as the brilliant Magnolia.<br/><br/>The script is often funny whilst at other times heart breaking and even though it has the sense of being contrived with the aim of getting an emotional response from its viewers it can be forgiven for this because at the end of the day it does work.<br/><br/>For me a major revelation was Matt Dillon, he is one of those actors I had not seen much of before for whatever reason and he shone for me in a truly first class believable performance.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the plot for those who are yet to see the movie but the road accident scene involving him and Newton is plain awesome and I love the interaction between them in the car and the way although his prejudices are wrong they do not in themselves define him as a bad person - just a messed up one.<br/><br/>The film is not without its critics and many think it is Hollywood dribble with no clear or relevant message. I believe it shows none of us to be without prejudice of some form or another even if this is sometimes hardly a conscious thing."
"tkrolak","5","3","7","21 November 2006"," good intentions, but not worth the Oscar
","My main problem with Crash is that it is supposed to be about the harm that racism does but that the event which drives the plot contradicts this view. Two young black men rob, at gunpoint, a well to do white couple of their van. <br/><br/>Aside from the stereotype of youthful black males from the inner city committing a crime, what is the story telling us by making the victims upper middle class whites? The title is supposed to mean the collision between vastly different worlds, those of privilege and poverty, and various races. But doesn't the wound inflicted on the socially prominent husband and wife by men of color from a disadvantaged background only feed the fears of some whites? One of the gunmen, talking to his partner, days after the theft has happened, points to another young African-American man who is their neighbor. He says that he just goes after the small stuff, like snatching purses. This dialogue just further re-enforces the negative image that black males have to contend with. <br/><br/>Another flaw is the scene with a white policeman, a black woman with whom he has had an encounter, and a car crash. Here, his heroism is a marked exception to the racism he shows in much of the rest of the story. Is there any part of a movie released in 2005 that is more co-incidental and manufactured than that one? Also, Sandra Bullock plays such a whiny, difficult character, who could have any sympathy for her? She eventually sees how bigoted she has been and is persuaded by her Hispanic housekeeper to be nicer. Oh sure, that would happen! Her change and the cop's bravery in the aftermath of the accident put the film on the level of a morality tale that would be shown to highschool students."
"starlit-sky","6","3","7","14 October 2006"," Movie about racism and good and bad in people
","In a society where everyone has racist inclinations, everybody's path is bound to collide with each other, especially in a racially diverse city like LA. The movie has a very strong message but I am not so impressed by the way the message is delivered. The plot seems to me to be a little too contrived. The structure of the plot is similar to ""Traffic"" where there are different group of characters each living in their own world and their paths cross each other unexpectedly. It seems every character has an issue with a certain race. One cop doesn't like blacks and harasses a black woman in front of her husband, two other black guys don't like white people, and harass a white couple and steal their van, some middle eastern guy's store is broken into and he blames a black guy, some Chinese guy hates some other race (I cannot remember, there were too many hating going on). It's like a contest of hatred (whoever hates the most number of races wins!). The message is serious but I think some of the dialogs are just overdone. They are way too direct and not subtle enough. We get it, these people are racist and racism is a bad thing. We get it, we get it. The way the characters behave is just too over-the-top. The story and unfolding of the events are enough to give us an idea of what's going on in their heads, do we really need to hear every little racist thought they are thinking? I am also not so pleased with the way every group of character crosses path with the other - so many coincidences. I know the title is ""Crash"" and it is part of the movie's message: people colliding with each other. But again, some coincidences come off as contrivances (so long I don't read the screenplay writer's thoughts, I am OK with it but when I can read them, then to me they are contrived for a purpose and that takes away from the movie). Overall, not a bad movie but not good enough to win an Oscar."

","Finally caught up with this. Because of the multiracial LA theme I was dreading another ""Grand Canyon"" (for my money one of the most unintentionally hilarious movies ever made): earnest and self-congratulatory, a salve for the love-me-I'm-a-liberal soul. ""Crash"" is a far better film than ""Grand Canyon"" but ultimately stoops to the same beatitudes.<br/><br/>""Crash"" does have some powerful scenes and well drawn characters, who are refreshingly neither good nor bad but struggling to be human in a hostile environment. It taps into something important (which goes beyond racism): how hard it is to be free of hate and distrust, how they poison us all. But any realism the film pretends to is undercut by the tidiness of the plotting, which is as mechanical as any slamming-door French farce. The script is TOO well constructed. Every character shows his or her racist side; then, within twenty four hours, each is handed a chance at redemption, which they predictably take. Only Matt Dillon really struggles with it, and that's more the actor than the script, and only one main character goes in the opposite direction. If life were like this movie, Mohammad Atta would have, as a dying gesture, helped a little girl in the WTC find the exit door.<br/><br/>Some say this is a very Christian movie, and they're right in that it's redemption mad and there's an invisible hand (God or Paul Haggis) pulling off miracles right and left. It's too bad ""Crash"" doesn't have the nerve to hold off on the easy resolutions, and the soothingly ethereal choral music. It's too bad a film with such an important subject couldn't serve it up straight, without the transcendence. The solemn spirituality of films like ""Crash"" is false comfort."
"eagle_owl","5","3","7","2 August 2006"," One-dimensional and over-rated
","Not to be confused with the David Cronenberg movie of the same name, Crash is a film about racial tensions in Los Angeles. It paints a picture of people of different races living uneasily alongside one another, while doing their best to keep the 'others' at arms length as much as possible.<br/><br/>Crash boasts a large ensemble cast, ranging from established stars such as Don Cheadle and Sandra Bullock to unknown actors in breakthrough roles. Ensemble dramas can work well, but in Crash there are just too many different plot strands all vying for attention, leaving some badly underdeveloped. Bullock's character for one would definitely have benefited from more screen-time.<br/><br/>While the acting is strong throughout, the film is let down by its script. All anyone ever seems to talk about is race, and while this is obviously the main theme, this obsession detracts somewhat from the film's realism, and risks turning the characters into ciphers. Also everyone has to voice every thought that enters their heads, rather than occasionally letting their actions alone do the talking.<br/><br/>Crash is attempting to address race in the way that Traffic tackled drugs, and it is interesting to compare the two films. Traffic benefits from having fewer separate story lines, and when the strands came together at the end it is much more convincing. Also, the film feels less like a straightforward issue movie than Crash does.<br/><br/>While racism is the film's overarching concern, there are also spiritual overtones, which seem to be fashionable these days (they even appear in Superman Returns). In Crash they centre on a lock-fitter who pretends to hand a cloak of invincibility to his daughter. Without giving away the ending, it is very implausible, and doesn't appear to have much to do with the main thrust of the narrative.<br/><br/>There are some effective scenes in Crash, and even some humour (in the exchanges between the two young car-thieves). However, the film just has too many subplots, making it feel at times like an extended TV episode. Racism is certainly an issue that needs addressing, which makes it all the more disappointing that Crash doesn't rise to the occasion."

"jay4stein79-1","5","3","7","28 December 2005"," Unfortunate
","I'm unsure how it happened, but Crash apparently duped the majority of film critics in America into thinking it was an extraordinary exploration of race and prejudice in America. I wholeheartedly disagree with anyone who thinks this movie deals intelligently with one of the problems that most plagues our country. You are entitled to your opinion, but I think you are wrong. Why has everyone been fooled? Roger Ebert recently named this his favorite movie of the year, and David Denby referred to it as the best American film since Mystic River. These are two of my favorite critics. Did I miss something? The rest of the IMDb community seems to think this a brilliant film as well. My one question: Why?<br/><br/>Is it because here is a film that is well-made? The direction is steady; the acting is above average; you can relate to the characters; and it addresses an issue that Hollywood generally steers clear of. My assumption is that because this movie is well-done and chooses to look at subject matter one typically does not see on the big screen, everyone has ignored the film's major flaws--and there are a lot of them--because this is the type of movie you should like. Who wants to say they don't like the movie that deals directly with race in America? Who wants to incriminate themselves by saying that this movie just isn't as smart as everyone thinks it is? No one, really. I'm exaggerating, I think, as it appears Salon.com and the New York Times were smart enough to see that this emperor wasn't wearing any clothes. <br/><br/>I saw this film when it was released on DVD and was very eager to watch it. I had heard wonderful things and had heard it compared to some of my favorite movies--Short Cuts, Magnolia, Nashville, etc. And, I thought, wow a movie that deals with racism in prejudice--we could really use one of those. <br/><br/>It was horrible let down. First, I will address a technical problems with the film. My major complaint in this area derives from the film's length. It's far too short. There are too many characters to introduce and too short a time period to do them any justice. These are not, to go back to ninth grade, round characters at all. They're two-dimensional, which is, granted, better than one-dimensional, but, really, a far cry from the depth of character one typically finds in a great movie. All Haggis has time to do is show us how a character ""is"" and then undermine or complicate that character's essence. So: (Remember how I said I included spoilers? Here are the big ones) the idealistic young cop who hates his racist partner and protects a black man whom his partner had wronged earlier kills an unarmed black youth and flees the scene. He's not a racist but his prejudices came to the surface and he shot someone. Oh my! The racist cop, on the other hand, shows real compassion for his sick father and rescues a woman he molested from a burning car. Holy cow he's complicated! The good black cop cannot remember the ethnicity of his maybe-girlfriend but he is such a good cop or is he? He does let exonerating evidence disappear so that the DA can get points with the black community. Man, these people are so deep! No, they are not. Some are more developed than others (Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle's characters, for instance), but they never come truly alive. Haggis simply has far too many other characters he wants to be central to the story to accomplish that. That's a major flaw of this film as a film. How can anyone ignore that? How can discerning viewers watch Crash and compare it to the three-hour behemoths Short Cuts and Magnolia, where the characters are given time to flower and grow? Really, did I see the abridged version of Crash?<br/><br/>Then there's the general uninspired-ness of the film. The cinematography is banal and the direction, which is passable, certainly leaves something to be desired. It's not bad, per se, but it is mediocre--never better than average. How can this be a great movie then?<br/><br/>Those are technical matters, though, that one can overlook when a film has something important to say. Look at Boyz in the Hood, which was not really well done, but it had an urgent message that affects its audience viscerally. It somehow rises above itself and some of its immature trappings. The same thing goes with Better Luck Tomorrow. Crash, though, has nothing important to say. Or am I supposed to think that ""we're all prejudiced on some level"" is a profound sentiment? Because I don't. I know that's true. Why? Because I've despised people at a glance simply because they wear shirts with their collars popped only to find out that, well, they're really all right. And because a group of teenagers wearing studded dog collars in a park will still cause me to go out of my way just so I won't have to walk by them. Who hasn't had thoughts like this? If you haven't, you're a saint. <br/><br/>Crash doesn't delve into the problem of race in America. It pretends to but barely scratches the surface. It has a facile understanding of race in America; it understands it no better than I do. We need art to show us alternatives and show us paths to a better world--something that Crash is incapable of doing.<br/><br/>I am very hostile towards this film, if you couldn't tell. Why is that? It's not a bad movie, really. It's simply that it has been afforded some privilege that it doesn't quite earn. It's been deemed great by many because it is an atypical Hollywood film that is done well. That does not make it a great or important film. It makes it an average one at best."

There was very little character development, too many small roles existed. 2. It was a bunch of cheap thrills. Too many moments where the viewer goes ""Oh my!"" Too bad the plot wasn't a little bit more developed and we knew the characters better. We might have actually cared then. 3.Sandra Bullock falling down the stairs as a dramatic scene? I laughed my ass off. 4. The view towards races and tipping held by Ludicrous is flawed and applies to more kinds of people than African Americans. As I college student, I generally receive poor service at restaurants because everyone thinks college students have no money. There are definitely more reasons for why this movie was bad that escape me at the moment. It bothers me that people act like they haven't seen a movie about racism before.

But ""Crash"" is too intelligent of a film to do that.<br/><br/>Instead we are given a group of diverse individuals, some of whom fit social and ethnic stereotypes, and some whom defy them. No one is demonized, not even those who fit somewhat into negative stereotypes, although all but one of the major character have serious emotional issues that they need to work out.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about ""Crash"" is how much I found myself identifying with each of the characters in that I have both been a victim of racism, and yet have also been one of those people made to feel guilty every time I do not like someone of another race, even if my feelings about them later prove to be right. I watched it with my mother, and we both found ourselves saying ""that's right"" and ""aha"" many times out loud.

","To misquote somebody, no film ever lost money underestimating the intelligence of the public. And this film is no exception. For in case you should not notice that it is about race, it is laid on with a trowel. Virtually every scene, every conversation, turns clumsily into a racial issue. Forget subtlety, it doesn't pay.<br/><br/>Examples: Scene 1: two cars have a minor collision. The drivers immediately begin trading racial insults. One (Chinese) accuses the other of being a typical 'Mexican driver'. The other driver (Hispanic) says because the first is Asian she's too short to see above the steering wheel.<br/><br/>Scene 2: two innocuous-looking young men (black) feel insulted when a wealthy woman (white) avoids them on the pavement. However - our assumptions are challenged - because the black men then pull out guns and rob the woman and her husband. When the couple get home, they have a loud, embarrassing (and implausible) argument because the man who's right there changing the locks is black, and the woman says he'll make copies of the keys so his 'homies' can burgle the house.<br/><br/>Scene 3: a man (Iranian) is in a gun-shop buying a gun, but the shop owner (white) insults him, saying that he's plotting jihad, and has him thrown out of the shop.<br/><br/>After a few minutes of this I thought it might tone down a bit, but no. It gets worse.<br/><br/>Two policeman (white) stop a couple (black) in a car for no good reason. One of the policeman gropes the black woman, which her husband feels powerless to stop. When they get home she upbraids him for Uncle Tom-like behaviour. The other policeman, horrified at his partner's racist behaviour, reports him to his superior; however the superior (black) doesn't believe him.<br/><br/>A man (white) goes to a health insurance office to ask a woman (black) to pay for his father to see a different doctor. When she declines, he accuses her of having got her job through preferential treatment of blacks.<br/><br/>Two men (black) are driving along arguing about the use of the word 'n**ger' in songs. They accidentally knock over a pedestrian. They look under the car and, seeing that he's Chinese, discuss whether to pull him out from under the car or just drive on.<br/><br/>And so on. White on black racism, black on Chinese racism, Chinese on Hispanic racism - almost every single scene (I'm not kidding) rapidly turns out to be a crude set-up for another racial issue with guaranteed shock-value. Conversations suddenly degrade into racial insults in a way that (though I don't live in Los Angeles) I've never, ever seen happen in real life.<br/><br/>In the second half of the film, it all goes a bit topsy-turvy, as new racial situations turn good guys bad and vice versa. The groping policeman (white) heroically rescues his female victim (black) from a burning car. The other, non-racist, policeman (white) gives a lift to a man (black), then, fearing attack, shoots his innocent passenger dead. Etc. etc. Hey, we may be dumb, but now you're really messing with our heads! Good films seem like reality, but much of this film felt so contrived it was more like watching a formula unwinding.

"jim.adamson","7","3","7","31 August 2005"," Some excellent scenes and performances, but ultimately flawed
","I expected to enjoy Crash very much, as it had a terrific cast and is a film built around a group of interconnected characters and stories, which draws its strength from characters and feelings instead of being a lazy, shallow blockbuster. I did enjoy it, but I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't as good as it could have been, and didn't completely hang together as a film.<br/><br/>There are a lot of fascinating characters and situations here. A couple of cops, one male one female, who have a tense relationship, struggle with themselves and each other as they try and unravel a complicated and political case. A pair of seemingly articulate and reasonable, albeit contrary and frustrated, young black men turn out to be professional car-jackers. They rob a high-profile white couple and we see the impact on their lives, and on the black professional couple who are stopped by the police thinking the similar car they are driving is the stolen one. We also see a hard-working Latino family man and a hard-pressed Iranian working family who are the victims in various ways of prejudice and bad luck. These stories and more are wound together in a series of memorable scenes that pack a lot of emotional punch. There is a strong element of racial tension in the air, and the atmosphere is really well-captured by writer-director Paul Haggis.<br/><br/>The problem is that having set up this fascinating collection of characters and stories, the makers unfortunately make some pretty wrong moves in deciding where to take them. A lot of really ridiculous coincidences are required to resolve a lot of the stories which are simply not believable, and some are quite badly conceived. It becomes melodramatic, which really jars with the very real and strong stories and people they began with and made the viewer care about. At least the characters are true to themselves in the way they act throughout, but a lot of the emotional impact is lost, and that compares badly to the strength of feeling Paul Haggis captured with his previous script, Clint's Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>The film reminded me - and suffered in comparison to - two films I really loved, Magnolia and Short Cuts. And those films show where Crash went wrong. To make this kind of film work you either need to build up believable characters and situations so carefully that the viewer is totally on board and believes everything from there on in, like Altman the master did with Short Cuts. The other way is like PT Anderson's Magnolia, reminiscent of South American magical realism, to set up characters that you really care about and want to follow on their journeys, then say to the audience, ""OK, what happens next is kind of unreal, but let's pretend that there is something strange in the air tonight that makes this happen, and we'll see what it does with our characters."" The audience doesn't really believe it but cares enough to go with the film and believe in the emotional truth of the stories even if they are unrealistic. Crash falls between these two choices by creating enough reality to make us believe it, but not building up that magical atmosphere that would make us go with it. Also both Short Cuts and Magnolia were nearer three hours while this is just less than two, and perhaps that rush led the filmmakers stumbling down the path of melodrama to resolve these interwoven stories in record time.<br/><br/>That said, there is a lot to enjoy and admire here, some terrific film-making and excellent performances throughout, especially Don Cheadle as a repressed cop, Sandra Bullock's best performance yet as a snippy, frustrated woman who hates the person she is becoming, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as one of the car-jackers and (the pick of the bunch) Michael Pena, who is simply superb as the Latino family man who finds himself caught up in a lot of other people's problems while doing his best to deal with his own. I'm glad I went to see it, and it's better than most things that have been released this year, and anyone who likes this kind of movie will enjoy it. But it could have been much better - on the plus side, it's made me realize I should go and buy Short Cuts and Magnolia on DVD!"
"marshreed","6","3","7","4 July 2005"," Missed the Mark
","Crash is gripping and well-acted but lacks the key ingredients which might have made it a great film. Crash introduces us to nine or ten protagonists within the various Los Angeles socioeconomic strata whose lives are inextricably and fatefully woven. Unfortunately, nine or ten proves too many and no single character develops beyond embryonic.<br/><br/>Crash also lacks credibility. Almost all of the characters are overtly and verbally racist. This film would have made much more sense if it had been released in the eighties when racial tensions were more elevated. (Think Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing"" or, if you're a reader, ""Bonfire of the Vanities"").<br/><br/>All-in-all, Crash is a good entertainment value. Very good performances by Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle and Thandie Newton. Unfortunately, they're only served in sample-size."
"LeonardOsborneKael","Null","6","19","7 January 2007"," Paul Haggis deals honestly with an aspect of human nature that we really would rather not acknowledge at all
","It is ironic that this ingenious film divides its viewers into two camps: those who are passionately devoted to it -- and those who are rabidly contemptuous of it. This is ironic, because Haggis' clear intention is to deliver some insight that might present some hope of bringing people together. Oh well -- that's the human animal, right? And the human animal is what Haggis is exploring here. I was distressed to find that so many people in Los Angeles took this film as a movie about THEM. It isn't. L.A. is an incredibly diverse place, ethnically speaking, and it has its very well-publicized problems with cultural and racial conflict. It therefore makes an ideal setting for a film about racism and prejudice and the darker recesses of the human soul.<br/><br/>This film is clearly not a technical masterpiece; in fact, it has a number of obvious flaws in on-camera performance and technical execution -- the kinds of things that happen when you only get one or two ""takes"". When you hear its creator relate the story of the making of the film the reasons for this situation become quite evident. In spite of Paul Haggis' spectacular track record, every major studio turned this production down flat. It was simply too controversial for them. This left Haggis with a choice: abandon the project -- or go forward on a shoestring budget. It's a triumph, in my opinion, that Haggis attempted and succeeded at the latter. And its a tribute to the social consciousness of the major and minor stars who worked on this film for nothing (or next to nothing) that there are scenes in this film that will resonate with its audience for a long time.<br/><br/>Long ago there was a Public Service spot that ran on TV for many, many years. It featured scenes of children of various ethnicities with a pious sing-song voice-over that went like this: ""You've got to be taught to hate and fear ... you've got to be carefully taught."" In those days, it was widely held that racism could be forever eradicated by simply bringing children up with an ""Equal Opportunity"" mindset. For anyone who is still thinking along those lines, watch this film -- then see if you still think that way."

Performances are topnotch, including Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon. Sandra Bullock does an admirable job also, cast against type as the haughty, demanding wife of the district attorney.

"acmilan03c1","9","5","15","5 March 2006"," I love the academy!!!!
","I got up today at 5:30 to just spot the first award won by Crash, for Best Editing. It still seemed like Brokeback Mountain was the hot favorite to win the Best Picture award, and Ang Lee's win in the Best Director category came only to confirm such predictions. By the time Jack Nicholson sat there looking at the piece of paper with his bewildering stare, getting ready to announce the winner of the Best Motion Picture of the Year award, I had lost almost all hope, on a night when surprise seemed to have given way to confirmation in all categories. All the more happy was I when I heard the magic word! Crash, my favorite, had done it, Crash had pulled the big upset! 2006 would indeed remain in moviegoers' memory as the year when Crash won the Academy Award. It was at that precise moment that I understood why I have always been so partial to the Academy - it's because they have nearly (they are human; remember Rocky vs All The President's Men?) always chosen the actual best film as the winner of the Best Picture Oscar! Of course, in the end, it's all a matter of opinion, mostly, but, as far as I'm concerned, the Academy knows its business!<br/><br/>Quite obviously, Brokeback Mountain is also a very good film, and in a year that hasn't produced masterpieces the likes of The Godfather, Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, The Return Of The King - to quote just a few - it certainly would not have been a wrong decision to hand it the Oscar, eventually. However, Crash does so much more in terms of involving the audience (after all, not all of us are gay, so give us a break). Crash delivers its message with more power and clarity, and that is, I think, something the members of the Academy have always appreciated. Brokeback, on the other hand, approaches the issue it deals with from too many angles, I think, and it tends to get a little overloaded at times, not being able to deal with so many aspects in the limited time - what I mean is that it's not always to the point, and that isn't to its advantage. The performances are great, but the same can be said about Crash. Ang Lee I think deserved his Oscar fully. However, if there is a film this year that really moved me and made me think, that definitely has to be Crash."

","*Note* I seen this movie in the theaters when it first came out Having said that, I'm extremely shocked that this movie is receiving such praise. The movie plays on everyone prejudices to make a story and supposedly to give society a wake up call. But in fact, the only thing it is doing is making people even more afraid to speak their minds because they are trying to be politicly correct. I'm not saying things like what are portrayed in the movie don't happen. I live in the South so I've seen/heard some of the worst racism you could imagine. With that in mind, the movie's characters are each changed due to racism in an extremely exaggerated manner. This was Hollywood's ""Trying to make Society a better place"" movie but in reality all it was was a ""Make everyone think it's a hard hitting movie so we can make some money"" movie. In conclusion, this movie had a very unrealistic feel to it. It did have some great acting but not matter how good the actors were, the story was still plain out bad."

The acting was superb and the story was emotionally gripping. *Spoiler Alert* If your heart was not in your throat when the little girl was almost shot, you have no humanity. It was one of the most impressive scenes I have ever seen on film. And when the gun had blanks and gave the shooter a chance a redemption and he took the chance... WOW!! When the racist police office was able to save his victim, and when the carjacker could save a group of immigrants from exploitation and slavery...moving! People all too often stereotype themselves and act in accordance with others expectations, so the stereotypes portrayed ring true. But people in this film are able to rise above these stereotypes at critical moments. Are there too many coincidences? Of course, but great storytelling needs some license. This movie went beyond the normal Hollywood formula that people are used to. It wasn't the typical movie with a theme consisting of ""racist person is evil and must be ridiculed and vilified."" Its message was that racism is pervasive, otherwise good people can have racist moments or views, and people can overcome their racism and redeem themselves. It also pointed out that there are situations where cultural bias can be as dangerous as overt racism. This was an entertaining and thought provoking film with terrific acting. Congrats to this movie for its Best Picture win!"

","In about a month Crash will do battle for Best Motion Picture of the Year at the Oscars as well as awards for acting, writing and directing for it's powerful portrayal of race relations in Los Angeles over two days near Christmas. And by powerful, I mean extremely boring. Basically what the movie boils down to is two hours of white liberal guilt, the movie was written and directed by Paul Haggis, writer of Million Dollar Baby, and needless to say the liberal movie academy ate the movie up giving it six nominations.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a car crash involving Don Cheadle (NFL Playoff Commercials) and Jennifer Esposito (Dracula 2000). Cheadle is really shaken up and goes off to la-la land before we head back to yesterday. I have to say the going back in time has become the most annoying plot devise currently used today in movies and television. There should really be a moratorium on using it. What's worse in this movie, and this may ruin it a little, but not as much as watching it played off ruined the movie, but they never come back to this crash later in the movie unless I fell asleep and completely feel asleep.<br/><br/>Early on we are also introduced to two black men, Larenz Tate (of the wrongfully shelved Love Money) and Chris Bridges (who you may, or more likely not know as Ludicrous) who complain how a white woman clutches her husband as they come closer only to carjack the couple. And knowing Bridges is a rapper in real life only makes his soliloquy against the genre cheesier. The couple in question is Sandra Bullock (Miss Congeniality 1 & 2) and Brendan Frasier (Encino Man), who is the District Attorney who is mad that being robbed by a couple black dudes may hurt retaining the black vote in the next election.<br/><br/>There's also yet another good cop, Ryan Phillippe (Mr. Reece Witherspoon), bad cop, Matt Dillon (Herbie: Fully Loaded) tandem who pull over a black couple just for fun and the black dude, Terrence Howard (Mary J. Blige's Be Without You video) just stands there and lets Dillon molest his wife, Thandie Newton (The Chronicles of Riddick). Just for fun, Haggis even threw in families full of Hispanics, Asians, and Arabs just so no one would feel left out. Well except the Indians are once again forgotten. At least you still have baseball teams that make light of your racial stereotypes.<br/><br/>Each of the characters eventually intertwines with each other showing up in other story lines much like a Lost flashback. But much like this season of Lost, it all becomes ho-hum when you see this happening mostly because you see it coming a mile away. Speaking of Lost, be sure to look out for Jin who makes a blink and you miss it cameo. Also don't forget to look out for Tony Danza (The Tony Danza Show), in the most interesting scene in the whole film, as a movie producer who complains that an actor isn't ""black"" enough, Priceless."

When this convoluted film finally drew to a close, the only question I had was: Is LA that f$%king small? To end this comment on a positive note, I felt the redeeming features of this film were its acting (although Sandra Bullock's curiously immobile face had difficulty registering emotion), and its subject matter (racism).

It is the genuine sixth sense that Detective Graham Waters is trying to portray when he compares our use of the human emotion to our mind-frame of driving in a car.

It's basic goal is to show that all Americans have good and bad in them regardless of race / ethnicity, and that circumstances lead to certain actions. It wants to show that we are all prejudice. However, by trying to do the impossible of picking representatives of each group, it ends up doing the opposite of it's goal. We are supposed to leave the cinema having some sympathy and understanding for them all: The racist cop (who also risked his life and loves his dad), the rich housewife (who is lonely and loves her maid), the car-jacker (who is funny, and saves the slaves). But what about the Chinese? In the end they were portrayed as only bad. She was a bitch, and he was a slave- trader. I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like the film if I was Asian. And where was the Muslim representation? It was unjustified that the Persians were treated badly because they were mistaken for being Arab. So would it have been okay if they were Muslim? And if everyone was supposed to be portrayed as good and bad, then why were the Hispanic only good? Don't get me wrong, I liked the locksmith and his family, I am just trying to say that inevitably everyone is not shown equally good and bad, and thereby the film creates it's own prejudice.<br/><br/>I admire what the director tries to do and find it an important topic, but I found the film quite predictable, very sentimental and American, and not at all experimental or new in it's cinematic approach.

","This movie tries very hard to be a racially themed version of Magnolia and doesn't come close to the power of human emotion in that film. Don't get me wrong Magnolia is indeed a flawed film itself but it succeeds much more than it fails. And if you don't believe Crash wants to be that movie take a look at the musical montage near the end showing where all the characters are in the story and the freak of nature occurrence of snowfall in L.A., no rain of frogs granted but almost as unlikely. But where Magnolia took the time to stretch out its characters and provide plenty of room for its random connections and coincidences Crash fails completely. The movie piles on coincidence after coincidence until they lose all emotional power and any chance of being truly compelling. Someone needs to tell the director the old saying goes, ""Less is More"" not ""More is More"" which seems to be his mantra for this film. If there were just one or two in the film they would have packed much more of a punch. Instead I found myself predicting which one would come next and rolling my eyes at the absurd number of them. I do believe there's a good intention behind this movie but it doesn't matter when it sledgehammers you over the head with its themes. Racism is definitely much more subtle today then what is portrayed in this film which makes it much more disturbing then the blatant over the top portrayals we see in the film. And by the way what good does it do to have a black character discuss white people's irrational racist fear of black people and then have him perpetuate that stereotype by indeed being a carjacker. COME ON! I expected more from a talented writer such as Paul Haggis who did such a beautiful job with the script for Million Dollar Baby. There was a movie with subtlety that had emotional power. Most of all I felt absolutely no sympathy for Sandra Bullock's character who was nothing but a spoiled rich bitch who deserved to fall down those stairs and preferably not be helped. An even bigger problem is practically none of the characters are held to any kind of real accountability for their actions. I don't care how angry the convenience store owner was that gives him no right to point a gun at a man in front of his family and try to kill and then not be held accountable for his action just because of some B.S. Deus Ex Machina about blank bullets. ACCOUNTABILITY people that's a message that needs to sent."

The movie made you really think about how we are all interconnected in some way or another, and how one's actions (although they may seem insignificant) do affect other people, and serve to either promote harmony or discord in the world. It was a wonderful portrayal of the diversity of people, and how that in itself plays out in a big city."

","I saw this movie before reading any of the reviews. Let me start by saying that I enjoyed it, placing it in the category of ""good"" movies that I have seen, but not ""great"". Had this movie come out a few years ago, before Magnolia, Traffic, 21 Grams and others in that genre, I would have viewed it as quite original. Unfortunately, the story lines that I expected to reveal jaw-dropping surprised were thinly concealed and not all that surprising.<br/><br/>One refreshing aspect of the movie was the locksmith and his family. A presentation of this type of relationship, showing a loving 2-parent moderate-income family of color, was the one realistic aspect of the film. They exist more than film and television leads the country to believe. The rest of the main characters seem to be stereotypical caricatures of white, African-American, Arab-American, and Asian-American people from the white perspective.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie to discuss with a diverse group of friends or co-workers, since it brings up a number of important issues - police corruption, affirmative action, immigration, crime, HMOs, etc.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 7. The acting was superb, but the filmmaker could have done a better job of crafting the story to build better connections with the characters, the crash/crashes, and the incidents that led to their being there instead of focusing so much on the extreme stereotypes."

","Crash is a solid movie for me, it's not amazing but I do think that it's got very good intentions and found the story to be very interesting and while I do agree that it shouldn't have won Best Picture that doesn't make it a bad film. One thing that nobody can deny about this film are the excellent performances by its entire cast with Michael Pena, Terrence Howard and Matt Dillon being the standouts. Pena gives a fragile and heartwarming performance here I loved his scenes with his daughter and you truly feel for him with the racism he has to deal with. On the opposite end of the spectrum Matt Dillon completely falls into his hostile and racist character but the best thing about his character was the fact that you understand why he is the way he is the fact that he has not got the right but the right reasons for his feelings and quickly turned from a hate able character into an intriguing and sympathetic one. Terrence Howard plays a perfect coward he's become used to the casual racism and discrimination that he has to put up with on a daily basis and watching him let it all happen while he wanted to do something was truly tear jerking especially in the scene with his wife. Technically this movie is fantastic Paul Haggis did an excellent job directing this film he panned along very nicely and he's back enough to left the actors to perform on their own without ever getting in their way with needles cuts and movements. This film won an Oscar for its editing and its very well deserved they knew when to cut at just the right time and managed to keep the film very well balanced. However this film is far from perfect for one, it lacks subtly instead of allowing the actors to just emote through their performances the writers felt the need to have them go on with big monologues or outbursts. When certain characters snap it just didn't feel earned while you certainly understand some frustration or anger it just seems as if they've lost the will to live and it just feels so out of place. An I found the ending of this movie to not really fit with the rest of the film it feels to much like a sitcom from the 90s. However I thought they did do a good job at closing out all of the character arcs in a satisfying way. <br/><br/>Crash is not perfect it's got some narrative issues and some over the top moments and it. Certainly should not have one best picture against Munich (one of my favourite movies). But it has fantastic performances and a great message that I could really get behind. <br/><br/>78%/B+"

It is just so incredibly overdone! Oh my god. It just gets dumb. Everyone is a unlikable racist. And it's been a while since I saw a movie with this many, this annoying characters. Like 95% of them, I just wish they'd die. And everyone is a complete asshole.<br/><br/>Crash only has one really good scene. But I have to admit though, that a couple of the not-so-good scenes did get to me a little. There's some emotional stuff here, and some of it works. A lot doesn't, but some works.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog is just plain idiotic. It is so forced, nobody would react like these people do. Most of the major plot points could super easily have been avoided if the characters had talked to each other like normal people, and not in the stupid drama-movie-way that they do.<br/><br/>I went into this expecting a solid drama, but once again I am disappointed by a so called ""good"" movie.

","""Crash"" has been my all-time favorite movie since its release in 2004. The character development of the principle actors/actresses is brilliantly woven through simple, short, everyday frustrations and circumstances. ""Never judge a man until you've walked in his shoes"" is my self-assigned moral to this movie. In a sort of round robin, viewers learn about each character in succession, but unlike most movies, this story line is not content with ""villains"". Crash suggests in not-so-subtle terms that even hateful characters have very good reasons for being the way they are. The writers go to great lengths to explore these perspectives and, in a truly refreshing art form, leave the viewer convinced that we are all in this life together."

","I was pleasantly surprised by Crash, to be honest. I always would see it at the store, mean to pick it up because it had won Best Picture, but never got around to it. Man, what a film. I think what I was most impressed with during the film was how well the script balanced the characters. Time could have been easily spent on one or two of them, but I am glad that they were all well developed and given generally equal screen time. Michael Pena really flexes his acting muscles here and I do believe that he stole the show. Arguably my most favorite part about this film was that all the characters that are seen doing this horrible things go through a phase of redemption. It is wonderful to see these very human and flawed characters make amends or at least make peace with themselves. My jaw dropped during the scene where the Middle Eastern man is threatening Michael Pena's family and also it was very powerful to see Matt Dillion's character rescuing Thandie Newton's after harassing her earlier in the film. We need a theme of redemption in our society these days, to remind us that there is still hope out there and that there is still good in all people."

","The movie of Paul Haggis got three Oscars in 2006. Unreasonable! All humans are shown in stereotypes, with all kind of prejudices. I know this was in mind of the director, but it is made in a really unrealistic way. <br/><br/>The movie starts with an hysteric little Asian women (Alexis Rhee) and a feisty Latina (Jennifer Esposito), who have a car accident and shout at each other. In the next scene their are two criminal Blacks (Larenz Tate and Chris Bridges) who steal the big car of a white, considered, rich prosecutor (Brendan Fraser) and his racist wife (Sandra Bullock), who accuses the locksmith (Michael Pena), a poor Latino, to be criminal. There's also a scene where two police officers (Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe)stop the car of the rich black TV-series director (Terrence Dashon Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton). One of the officers molests the wife, but nothing happens to him, because neither her husband, nor the non-racist officer, helps her. And then, in the end of the movie, the victim and the cop meets again, this time in a burning car, caused by an accident, and he rescues her. Of course there is also one crazy Iranian, and a racist, old gun-shop owner. Every type of stereotype in just 112 min. That is to much!<br/><br/>The plot is full of contingencies, that would never happen like this in real life. Most of the characters are just so typical stereotypes, they are just existing in our minds. It was funny to watch them crashing into each other in some scenes, but at least it was not as good as most of the other reviews say."
"simone-rademacher","4","2","4","24 June 2013"," Too many crashes
","And the Oscar goes to Crash. This movie, produced by Paul Haggis who also worked on the script of ""Million Dollar Baby"", won, as I have already said, three Oscars in 2006, for the Best Original Screen Play, the Best Film Editing and for the Best Picture. No doubt, that is a good achievement, but one question remains for me: ""Why did this film win three Oscars?!""<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie you are confronted with its ending and in the following it is shown how this came to happen. The whole plot takes place in Los Angeles during 36 hours. We have two car-jacking African Americans (Larenz Tate and Chris Bridges) who feel discriminated against by everyone. They steal the car of Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) and her husband (Brendan Fraser), a white and rich couple. Furthermore there are a TV-series director (Terrence Dashon Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton) who are black, but life in the upper middle class. Thy get controlled by a racist LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) who is on patrol with his partner (Ryan Phillipe) who watches Dillon's behavior towards African Americans with disgust. And last but not least we have a Persian store owner (Shaun Toub) who thinks he is cheated by a Mexican locksmith (Michael Pena). All these people of different ethnic groups ""crash"" into each other and have to deal with their prejudices.<br/><br/>The message of Crash is clear; we definitely have to do something against racism and discrimination, as they can even lead to death. We shouldn't have any prejudices about people we don't know, no matter where they come from or what their religion is. Crash is a movie with many cuts, surprising changes and a lot of different stories told at the same time, which makes it hard to understand.<br/><br/>In my opinion there are too many stories told in this movie; too many different things happen. If Haggis put two or three conflicts less in the story, the film would be more logical and realistic. You have to keep in mind that all this happens in 36 hours and I don't think that that is very likely. The worst part of the movie is the end, when nearly every conflict disappears, nearly every problem is solved and the characters just go on living their lives as if nothing had happened. The only good thing I can find in the movie is the message. <br/><br/>Crash is a nice try to open people's eyes to the racism that exists around us, but the story is unrealistic and confusing."

If it would have picked maybe 2 or 3 main aspects and really developed those ideas then I would have enjoyed it a lot more. Certain scenes were done beautifully and really captured my attention. On the other hand, the ending didn't really connect all the dots and have that aha moment. I understood it, just didn't really love it. The direction was very good and held it together along with the acting. I can't say it doesn't deserve Best Picture because I haven't seen any others that really deserve that title, but nevertheless good job."

","Prejudice, prejudice, prejudice. A great movie about racially motivated prejudices in the USA- this is Crash. They are shown from every point of view, justified and unjustified, because of many reasons, which are not related to each other in any way. The blind alley of people who are discriminated is shown very clearly, especially (in this movie only) “the colored” (I do not want to harm anybody!). The film is made in form of a couple of stories, which are not cooperative and at the end some of them will bind together. And the consequences? An absolute distrust! We are so blind that we cannot accept (gifts), or anything without repaying it, so everybody is suspicious. Crash is a really great movie, where the problem of prejudices is shown very clearly and objectively."
"wspears49","7","2","4","10 October 2005"," A Noble Effort
","The best thing about Crash is that it gets people talking about racism and bigotry after the movie is over. The subject matter itself would do that, but I think that Haggis does two things to ensure that people talk about bigotry afterwords.<br/><br/>First, Haggis creates characters that are stereotypes, in the worst sense of the word. They are meant to infuriate the audience. Most of the people in this movie have very little nuance or subtlety to their character. This is deliberate, on the director's part.<br/><br/>Second, the first hour of this movie is relentless in its depiction of bigotry. With each new scene, the audience braces itself for another round of racist caricature and vile epithets being spewed by the characters.<br/><br/>My problems with the movie are two.<br/><br/>First, I think that Haggis has too many story lines going, he needed to lop off about two of them--in order to explore the other stories in more depth, and to resolve the remaining story lines more satisfactorily. <br/><br/>My own feeling is that the story line specifically revolving around the white district attorney, played by Brendan Fraser, could have been eliminated (although I do think that, at least the early part of the story of Sandra Bullock, Brendan's wife, was important to keep in the film). I also think that the story line revolving around the Chinese businessman and the slave trade should have been removed.<br/><br/>There are simply too many holes and questions left unanswered by the end of the movie, for it to be considered an excellent movie, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Second, while I understand what I think that Haggis was trying to do with the first hour of non-stop bigotry, I don't think it ultimately works. Haggis needed to rework the structure, so that the viewer got some relief and resolution early in the film to some of the film situations--and so that other problem situations could be introduced later in the movie. <br/><br/>The way the film was structured, the audience becomes somewhat numb by the end of the first hour--from all the tension created by the racist hate being thrown at the viewer. The audience then gets the sense that it can relax a bit, in last hour, as it is mainly a resolution to the conflicts from the first hour--this makes the audience somewhat lazy, I think. <br/><br/>Haggis would have made a better film if he had mixed things up a bit more structurally, so that the audience was constantly on its toes, not knowing whether to expect tension or relief.<br/><br/>My favorite story lines, were the ones revolving around Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton (and her husband, whose face is new to me--so I don't know his name, but he was very good in his role). And the plot revolving around the Hispanic locksmith, his daughter, and the Iranian shopkeeper was also a favorite story line of mine--although I have to admit that some of that story didn't make much sense. It wasn't the daughter's magic cloak that was non-logical, that was perfectly fine. It was the Iranian's attitude toward the Hispanic that didn't make any sense to me, and rang false. But I still found the story line compelling and emotional."

","Crash is the clever kid in your class. It rises above the usual Hollywood drivel by dealing with some tricky subjects in an intelligent way. It looks good, has a good strong cast and has beautiful music for 99% of the film. On the other hand it is slightly contrived and the plots twists are easily recognisable, there is a terrible bit at a murder scene and the film plays out with the stereophonics (wtf?) But these are not good enough reasons to not see this film they just let it down slightly. Overall the piece deals with racism in a way no mainstream movie has in our new climate of the terror of skin colour (be it terrorist or carjackers) it has a strong script that is brilliantly played out by actors such as Cheadle, Dillon, Bullock and Newton. Some of the scenes involving race issues are cringe worthy but ultimately rewarding. Crash plays out a little bit like magnolia but without the quirkiness and singing. It is a one of those films that critics hail as absolutely brilliant like last years sideways. Both films are good but not brilliant. I think what happens is when so many films arrive that are average and then one comes along that is slightly above that people get carried away. Don't let me put you off please go and see crash it is one of the better films you will see this year. A mainstream movie with a conscience and a heart."
"debbie_brooks","6","2","4","31 August 2005"," Heavy-handed
","I was really looking forward to seeing Crash, but I'm afraid I found it quite dull and heavy handed. While the quality of the actors on screen is not in doubt, the large ensemble cast means that no one set of characters has much screen time and it is hard to get to know the characters and empathise with their actions. The handling of the race elements, although well-intentioned, came across as heavy handed, particularly the part of the film involving Matt Dillon's character, his background story and how he interacts with the health care/medical insurance clerk. However, what I did like about Crash was how the different elements of the story came together; I particularly enjoyed the strand involving Daniel the locksmith who was trying to make a better life for his family. I really wanted Crash to make me think about the issues it raised, but I left the cinema feeling a bit disappointed and let down."
"russell100uk","8","2","4","31 August 2005"," One to make you think
","Crash is a powerful movie about the perception of minorities in modern society, a riff on racism that challenges stereotypes and the way in which we, as human beings, are prone to make assumptions based on the appearance of an individual, often playing off of pre-conceived idea's that have been embedded into us from an early age.<br/><br/>Opening with a car crash, we then backtrack to yesterday, as an ensemble cast's lives intertwine in the diverse density of the L.A. metropolis. But, unlike Magnolia, Crash is less interested in the ways in which fate and chance dictate everyday events, and more with how bigotry and racial tension exists in every corner of this multi-cultural melting pot. Where Crash is most successful is in how it challenges certain racial stereotypes and how it subsequently portrays the effects racism has on everyone's lives. It's not just a simple case of white vs. black. It goes much deeper, as we realise that intolerance is widespread and isn't confined to the white middle classes, that it exists between all colours, all races, all cultures. The finger of blame is easiest to point at somebody who doesn't look like you, who doesn't have your upbringing. Because of this, they must be in the wrong, right? Matt Dillon's veteran cop has this outlook. His father lost everything because of minority rules and he holds a deep grudge against all blacks, regardless of age, sex or profession. Yet this bigotry is awkwardly juxtaposed between his genuine care for his sick father and his honour and duty as an officer of the law, something he later demonstrates during a life or death situation. Director and writer Paul Haggis twists the stereotypical views further with the characters of Terrence Howard, a young, black film-maker and Michael Pena, who gives an outstanding & extremely subtle performance as Daniel, a young Hispanic locksmith with a wife and young daughter, with whom he shares one of the films most touching moments. In fact all of the cast do a fine job with their roles, even Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, in an attempt to branch out, providing some of the funnier moments of the movie with his musings on black oppression. And lets not forget Don Cheadle, as a cop who finds his integrity challenged after investigating a messy bout of cop on cop action.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, the thing that will stay with you the longest is the simple message that shines throughout the film. ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Every character displays the devil inside of them but it's only one part, there is good in everyone, it just needs an outlet, an opportunity to break through. As the film reaches its climax we are forced to consider how we look at people in everyday life. How we label and pigeonhole certain cultures, certain races, into one group, with no distinction between the good and the bad. In an increasingly paranoid world, where we are being schooled in how to be suspicious of unfamiliar practices and alien customs, Crash serves as a hard reminder that while we must be careful in our own daily lives, we must be equally cautious not to discriminate and adversely affect the lives of many hard working, decent citizens just because of the actions of a few.<br/><br/>If there are any gripes with the film (and these will be minor) it's that what your watching is a collection of vignettes, snippets of these characters lives beamed direct to your brain for your benefit, and not a cohesive story that links seamlessly between strands, in the vein of the excellent Magnolia. At the end of the film characters have reached resolutions, but these aren't earth shattering, life changing epiphanies, rather smaller, more personal realisations that will, you assume, change their way of future thinking. Like much of the movie, it uses a lo-fi approach to the drama, making the final payoff that much more powerful and ultimately, delivering the emotional kick necessary to immerse the audience within this world."

","SUPER BRIEF SPOILERS, ALMOST NONE<br/><br/>Paul Haggis co-wrote and directed this movie in 2004, about racism, prejudice, stereotypes and revealing people's true colors. Watching this today, it is relevant to our world, I guess, but also very different. Haggis writes about many characters that are not exactly connected, and their personal stories about racism, prejudice, and stereotypes. You have the racist cop, the interracial couple between two detectives, the Hispanic man who gets in a lot of bad situations, two African-American men who cause trouble, and prejudice white woman Sandra Bullock. All of them have some racism or stereotypes or struggles with the world between people. Things escalate, and we see how bad things really can get. However, this movie manages to be overwhelmingly dramatic as well as underwhelming in terms of story.<br/><br/>The movie is so overdramatized and exaggerated with chunky dialogue, people's views of each other, and story structure. The movie manages to be super cliché with the plot. Some elements and dialogue are laughable because they are so dumb or coincidental. Now, besides the over-dramatic filming, slow sequences and build ups (such as a well-put together scene about a highway accident) the movie is actually underwhelming because the story and characters could have been taken in such a different way. There could have been SO MUCH more drama or development between characters and story. However, it is played safe and most things just carry on.<br/><br/>Before I wrap up, some positives are the cinematography and editing. The camera work is great, shots are beautiful and intense. The highway scene, for example, is really well done. Some acting is really good, Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton specifically.<br/><br/>The movie just never really wraps up. Haggis wanted to show that everyone has prejudice in them, no matter what they have gone through, if you encounter a racist cop as a minority, you'll be scared! That part is relevant to today, but there is just so much going on in this movie, that there is almost NO time for development. There is barely any character development, maybe Matt Dillon a little bit, but that is so brief. And in the end, racism just carries on like it did before, leaving us to just be like ""oh, I guess we have no hope of solving racism!""

","Crash (2004) :
Brief Review -<br/><br/>Heavy and dark but a positive dose on racial and social hatred. Crash is a story of society varying cultural thinking and traditional mindset of people that brings some positivity for sure. Set in Los Angeles, Crash tells a story of several people with different cultural thoughts about other cultural people and that somehow is more about hatred than the kindness. But by the time film ends it reverses the mindset by giving an important message on humanity and sociality. There are multiple characters in the film with regional and cast diversity such as Black people, White People, Persian People, Arab and even Chinese people. The trick here of taking all the stories forward simultaneously set in different conditions, different place and then colliding each other logically works smoothly. Some people had to die, some are survived so you feel sad but it was part of the narrative and people shouldn't take it negatively. Director Paul Haggis took a gutsy script and delivered it accurately. He made all the actors act naturally. Despite so many characters and so many racial events, the film loses pace at some occasions which is reluctant. Apart from that you need a positive thinking throughout to understand what film want to say about humans and thier behaviour. Couple of incidents will make you emotional, some will leave you with a guilt and some will disappoint you but the overall impact still remains fantastic. Crash is a Perfect Film to win Oscar as Socially important films have always been favourite but Crash did actually beat contemporaries in 2004.

The dialogue is terrible, there is not one person on the planet who talks like the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>The editing is basic and unspecial except in more difficult scenes that require more advanced editing. There it is either competent or lousy.<br/><br/>A product of Hollywood to show how woke they are by providing an incredibly simplistic picture of racism that lacks nuance and falls flat.<br/><br/>All the characters are like a caricature of real people and cannot be taken seriously and that is the script's fault. The acting is ok without being fantastic which is admirable considering what the actors have to work with.<br/><br/>In one scene at the beginning of the third act, Terrence Howard's character is confronted by a police officer played by Ryan Phillippe, this scene is actually effective. The acting and editing actually work to create an intense scene that gives a sense of genuine consequence. The scene is also helped by the fact that the characters that's involved are 2 of the film's very few relatable characters (which is pretty weird in an ensemble film with many of Hollywood's biggest names).<br/><br/>However, the scene that follows causes one to quickly forget the short sequence of competent filmmaking as the movie tries to force the audience into an emotional response by pushing us into a scene that is completely unmotivated where a child's life is endangered. An incredibly cheap trick to get the audience to feel some kind of intensity as the scene, as I said, has no place, structure or consequence.<br/><br/>The third act is too long, Haggis tries to weave together each character's individual archs accompanied by a manipulative soundtrack that tries to show how all racists, gang members and victims actually have more in common than what one thinks but by this time I am so incredibly checked out that I'm just longing for the subtitles."

","Incredibly gripping and massively entertaining, Crash may not know how to handle its social commentary quite as well as it thinks it does, but still proves to be a very important landmark in film. The film is very well acted, although there is no actor or actress that stands out more than the other. It almost feels like the films actors were given a challenge to play their heart out as best as possible while playing the most unlikable characters. The film is very emotionally gripping, and surprisingly was able to move me to tears at one point. It's incredibly well paced, and fairly handled, which is rather impressive considering its massive cast and vast array of storylines and character arcs. My biggest problem with the film, is that it seems far too heavy handed on its own issues, forcing the viewers to shove certain themes, harsh messages, and politically incorrect situations down their throats as if to say, here you go, deal with this. It just doesn't feel realistic, nor does it feel like it fits in the whole scheme of things, and just feels like a large weirdly handled way to show how racism is dealt with in this year of society. Nevertheless, Crash is able to be a very entertaining and gripping emotional thriller. It's issues lie in the things that it is trying to prove, and its yelling of them, despite not truly understanding what it is trying to say in the first place. It is well acted, cleverly paced, and contains a surprisingly decent soundtrack, and a large amount of emotion- of which is most appreciated and works the most well in the films complete run. Crash isn't perfect by far, but it is a very impressive and very unique picture, that deserves a watch if you get the chance.

","Crash<br/><br/>""Crash"" follows the lives of many different ethnic people and their injustices. The audience is led to follow this chain of racial injustice cues, blatant ignorance from each character, and unfortunate series of events.<br/><br/>To many, Crash tackles many repressed, psychological stereotypes. Every character is infused with hate and ""instinctive"" racism, but I don't buy it. In my opinion, everything felt rushed, forced, and absurd. Just like Magnolia, Crash intertwines the lives of what could be 10+ characters. With Crash, however, the story, editing and pacing is sloppy and I often forgot about half of them. Many of the scenes made zero sense and felt mashed together. Stupid actions had no consequences. There was no sign of community and thought. The sappy music didn't help reinforce the raw emotion depicted.<br/><br/>Crash, for me, is fatally flawed by its inability to redeem any of the characters. Each character displays no sense of awareness, logical thinking, and sympathy for the other. The performances were weak, and I disliked every character. As Crash attempts to shock its audience by including provocative characters, I only find it obnoxious and pretentious. If I want a good film about broken lives and how they intertwine, I'll just go watch Magnolia. It's not that this movie is the worst I've ever seen, but it sure as hell tries way too hard. Perhaps this film attempted to be counterintuitive by making the characters unlikeable solely on their racism, but I found them fake as hell, stubborn and robotic. There were multiple cringe-worthy scenes that I couldn't help but laugh at.<br/><br/>Crash won the award for Best Picture, Best Screenplay and Best Film Editing. I don't mean to be the millionth guy to hate on it, but it did not deserve the praise it received from the academy. It attempts to tell a compelling story about redemption and character development, but I didn't care for any of the characters from start to finish.<br/><br/>3/10"

Such a complete story, such a sophisticated language, such a strong control, in recent Hollywood films, it is difficult to find a rival.<br/><br/>Just because the story is too round, it makes me feel unreal. I'm not interested in the social problems of the American people. What makes me like and touch me about this movie is the universal dilemma of human nature contained in it. I don't think it's a sociological phenomenon or problem dissection. It's not the job of a film director, and Paul haggis can't afford it. He showed me the everyone face the dilemma of life and their effect on his life and the impact of the mind, the dilemma and anxiety and lead to anger and emotion everywhere around us, let people ignore the meaning of their psychology. Social problems cannot be solved by these coincidences one by one, nor can a single act of kindness cause a chain of improvements, and mental disorders are more difficult to heal overnight. A white cop who molested a woman of color could save the same woman with his life the next day, but at night he still had to face his old father, who was ill and unable to communicate, and the next day he would want to kill the black secretary. And it was the young cop, no matter how kind and objective, who ended up running away from the car after shooting down an innocent black man out of fear. Good and evil are not so easy to judge. The pressure of life, the loss of family affection, the insecurity, the humiliation of personality, how can you expect them to be at peace with each other? If you don't find a way to vent, I'm afraid everyone in the show would already have a nervous breakdown. Just a few more coincidences, their usual post-crash bickering and name-calling is suddenly elevated, pushed by fate to endure a greater test, allowing the power of reason to spin out of control."

There is a district attorney concerned only with his re-election prospects and his overtly racist, self-centered wife, two partnered street cops and a black senior detective, a shop owner that is vandalized and seeks revenge against a locksmith and several other supporting characters that add a great deal of power. This is one of those movies where all are supporting characters and all performances are outstanding.

","Haggis was nominated for an Oscar this year for writing Million Dollar Baby, but he considers EZ Streets - one of the best, if short-lived, TV crime shows ever - his greatest achievement.
So, if you're Haggis, you've written your share of gun scenes, and you're wealthy. One night, as you're leaving your local video store with your wife, two thieves steal your Porsche at gunpoint.
This happened in the 1990s, and Haggis still hasn't gotten over it. It could've hardened his heart. Instead, he wondered about the lives of those young men and about larger issues of crime, intolerance, social isolation, racial stereotyping, intertwined fates and the frustrated anger that simmers beneath the surface in every large city. Then he sat down to write.
Crash, the film that resulted, isn't the indulgent piece of therapy you might expect. It's an ambitious and often wonderful movie, an expansive look at urban life - the fractious, noisy whole of it - filled with witty, biting and insightful writing. Not only that, but it's also well-acted, with an all-star cast, and Haggis directs with fluidity and flare.

Crash receives a lot of criticism for being ""on-the-nose"" and ""self-defeating"" (among many other concerns) but I honestly think it's great. The editing looks amateur, yes, but the acting and storytelling are very engaging. To those who argue it is supposed to be about ""stereotypes are bad"" and then proceeds to contradict itself, I would say it is more nuanced than that. Something more like, ""we all stereotype whether we realize it or not, and we may find ourselves falling into stereotypes, but we should always check our assumptions.""

","7 May 2005. Easily and by the far the best movie in the first third of 2005, this likely to be awarded nominated racial drama scores high in the emotional punch in the soul department. The high tension and the heightened anger, frustration, and heated racial hatred are on fast forward throughout this movie. This is a no-holds barred movie with the language fast and loose, the women hot and heavy with their screaming and yelling and the men barely able to hold in their rage at the cruelty of the human condition. At the same time there is tenderness and humanity, the twists and curvatures turn back on themselves as the characters begin to relate to one another in unexpected ways not always with the best of results. Crash in probably on the best movies of the year, along with an unassuming but complementary score form Mark Isham (The Cooler). Sandra Bullock, Brandan Fraser, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe as well as the rest of the cast all gave outstanding performances. The only over-reaching, extreme moments are at the beginning as the feminine overdrive seems to be stuck on high as two of the female leads seem to represent the worse in women that we've all come to stereotype. There is also one subplot that seems to be underdeveloped that distractingly leaves lingering questions slowing the movie just a tad in several spots. But, nevertheless, first time director, Paul Haggis, of a full-feature film has a independent film hit on his hands. Nine out of Ten Stars."

The reason was it really touched my heart. This one could resonate with me. However, I would say it was overly done in some degrees. It's a hard subject to portray affectingly and effectively. The director successfully comprehended that by applying uncanny coincidences which were cleverly plotted.<br/><br/>Although the soap opera like scenarios proceeded throughout the whole movie. I do think the director employed them to carry out his sober messages and suited this short attention spam generation also. Even some shallow emotional subplots already carried calamities from the beginning of the movie. The dramatized storyline might be needed for this movie hence I am not sure it could be done without. <br/><br/>We are sharing the world with various ethnic groups of people.

"RyanCShowers","Null","0","0","13 February 2015"," A Divisive Report of Bigotry
","As a Best Picture winner, ""Crash"" is not often regarded as one of the best. In fact, most rank it at the bottom of the list of any best picture winner from any decade ever. While I understand the concerns with certain aspects of the movie not being up to par, ""Crash"" is an important story that deserved to be rewarded for its reporting and unraveling of bigotry, racism and xenophobia of society from shown from multiple perspectives. Brokeback Mountain probably should have won in 2005, but at least the Academy chose to recognize a socially significant film for its Best Picture award.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis' execution of the plot is the most divisive aspect of the film, and as each year passes, it feels as if more people ease over to the side of distaste conceding his directing work in ""Crash"". The film's primary problem is that the heavy moments rest at such a high level of melodrama that some feel the direction overdone and cheap. But whenever I think about ""Crash,"" the sensory atmosphere Haggis creates remains the most prevalent thing about the movie. The eclectic vibe the film produces launches off the screen. Haggis creates this tone with the camera-work, the editing and the score, which he uses to investigate the ideas in the script.<br/><br/>""You think you know who you areYou have no idea."" <br/><br/>When Matt Dillon's cop says it to Ryan Phillippe's less experienced character in the police force, it's almost as if Haggis is emblematically speaking to us, the viewers. <br/><br/>The screenplay shows sides of its fictional characters that we can recognize in ourselves, and some sides of things we don't want to see in ourselves. Every character—whether black, white, Hispanic, rich, poor, powerful—has a trait for which the viewer can latch onto and turn away from. Though many people who watch ""Crash"" probably would not consider themselves bigoted individuals, neither would many of the characters inside the film. But that's the intelligence of the ""Crash"": We identify with and admonish every character. There are correlations to ""Do the Right Thing"" in the way it explores internal human flaws exist beyond stereotypes. (""Crash"" is an inferior film to ""Do the Right Thing,"" but they conduct themselves in the same vein and have similar intentions.) <br/><br/>The last time I saw Crash was in 2009, and what has remained so active in my mind is the drastic information revealed about the characters, which moves us as the film pivots in its emotionally overwhelming climax. We learn these characters are complicated, as we see them take on the mask of the hero and the villain. While the credits roll, we sit mystified trying to piece together which person deserved or did not deserve our loyalty the most. The character development is enlivened by career-best performances from the epic cast ensemble, with standouts being Matt Dillion, Terrance Howard, Thandie Newton and Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>The idea of interconnecting stories was, of course, a narrative method used in film before, but the way ""Crash"" uses it invigorates the process. This type of story structure already divides people, so by adding race politics and a melodramatically unconcealed tone, ""Crash"" was doomed to face the brunt of controversy even before it defeated an upscale homosexual love story for best picture."
"sholic","5","0","0","11 June 2014"," Underwhelming
","My first Haggis film was In The Valley Of Elah. That fact coupled with the stellar cast had me going in with higher expectations than I'd usually like to set for any given film. Having said that, I don't think foregoing both reasons may have made me like it any better. The script was so filled with cusses I seriously thought it was meant to be funny at one point (when Howard was stopped by the police the second time, while being comically robbed by Ludicrous - which reminded me of another I would think unintended wtf scene - when Howard gave Luda's gun back to him. Yeah sure. That's the first instinct of any sane real person - just return a criminal's weapon back to him all the while quite nonchalantly telling him off he's an embarrassment to his whole race).<br/><br/>I guess that pretty much summed up my whole disliking of the film. It tries to portray real life but the characters were too unrealistically exaggerated. I just couldn't take the scene when the Persian (not Arab you asshole!) guy started to went off the Mexican guy accusing the latter of being a liar seriously. I know some foreigners (apologies for the blatant stereotyping but usually those from Eastern Europe, Middle East and South Asia descents) have similar xenophobia as the Persian guy but by God was he irrational or what? The sequence of events in his case was a one in a billion chance happening in real life.<br/><br/>Seeing as I'm off on a rant trail here, let's add Dillon and Bullock's ultra convincing portrayals of racists to the list. Newton was surprisingly bad but I would disregard it due to the horrible script again. Fraser should stick to his B-movies as that's what he shines in best. He will always be etched as Rick O'Connell in my mind. The only saving grace in this lukewarm mess were Cheadle, Esposito, Peña and Devine"
"jpschapira","9","4","12","5 March 2006"," You have no idea...
","To be honest, I began watching ""Crash"" an hour before the Oscars took place. Also to be honest, I had wanted to watch it for a long time, and even when I hadn't watched it, I kept claiming, for some reason, that it would win the Best Picture Oscar. To be more honest then, I finished viewing the film after the Oscars ceremony came to an end, and to be even more honest; I might not write enough to explain what this movie generates in the person who experiences it.<br/><br/>I find amazing how writers keep on finding ways to connect different people's lives. Writer/director Paul Haggis is not repeating any formula when he creates unions after a car crash; because he is taking his whole picture from a different angle. That's why it's amazing to me that today in Los Angeles racism is still a constant issueI don't know that, because I don't live there, but the first scene of this piece tries to analyze it.<br/><br/>Detective Graham (Don Cheadle) has just been in a car accident, and he talks out loud, about the people's sense of touch: ""We miss that touch so much"", he says, ""That we crash into each other just so we can feel something"". Moments later, Anthony and Peter (Ludacris and Larenz Tate) are walking out of a restaurant, discussing about a coffee that wasn't given to them and wondering why a white woman hugs her couple as she passes by. ""She shouldn't be scared, we should be"", Anthony shouts angrily.<br/><br/>What happens next is unbelievable as it is ironic. It shocked me and it will shock any viewer because people are not always like we think they are. Racial statements like Anthony's are all over the script, all over the film; but they're not stated just to be said: characters have motives to declare them. Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) sees his father suffering every day because he's got nothing left; he also blames (somehow) the black people in his father's industry for what happened. He is a racist because he resents black people.<br/><br/>Due to his position, Rick (Brendan Fraser) must be partial with the black community, whether that causes them good or wrong. His wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) must also be careful with blacks and boys from gangs, even if she's naturally paranoid and asks her lock to be changed again after a young man with a tattoo (Michael Peña) fixes it. For our surprise, the guy turns out to be anything but a gang member.<br/><br/>As it occurs with black people, it occurs with Arabs and Persians, or Chinese persons who are American citizens. They are perceived as the same thing, and starred at with the same rejection, although they are different. And I believe that this could be happening right now; this things could be being said, this actions could be taking place, when nobody is probably watching, or listening. Haggis and Moresco truly think they can show us what we could be missing.<br/><br/>It's about films like ""Crash"", ""21 Grams"" and ""Traffic"" that we talk about infinitely; because they have original characters within; which include original and unique stories. Here, particularly, Haggis places each one of his characters (and I omitted many of them) in a contradiction and with an observing, confident camera, a lot of light and an overwhelming music (Mark Isham), he messes with them; with their heads and emotions so they can figure everything out.<br/><br/>Some of them are already messed up and so desperately in need that they hug the only person who's beside them; for the reason that they need to let it all out. We watch closely and we feel sorry for them; for what they've got and don't appreciateAnd what they lack and will never achieve."

Instead of filming a fine piece of film work, the young director focused his attention on irrelevant stats about incarceration rates and middle eastern Persians and Muslims. It's his own opinions on the matter and they offer no perspective on American urban life. What we don't need is some Canadian director making a film on it. As an African-American-I felt the director was trying to preach to me on what it means to be black, like he or any other white American would really know.

","Crash is an incredible film and an important one.<br/><br/>The film concerns an ensemble of characters from diverse backgrounds, different racial origins, different class in society and different life experiences. The film follows no particular plot as such but instead cleverly intertwines the many subplots of its various characters and how the directly or in-directly touch each others lives, for better or for worse. Before I move onto the subject matter, it is important to point out that this film has reaped some awesome performances from its cast, notably Matt Dillon playing a been-to-long-in-the-force type cop and the desperate and fearful housewife trapped in her own life Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>Crash tackles the always tricky and always heatedly debated subject of racism in society. The film has been set in LA, most probably as LA is a city with a massively ethnically-diverse population and a huge divide between the classes. However this film could have been set in nearly any big city in the western world. The world is now so globalise, there is very few places left where you will not meet/pass in the street/know/ignore a person from a different ethnic background to yourself.<br/><br/>The film shows racism and ignorance in an un-apologetic and realistic context. Other films have (often successfully) tackled racism and the causes of, but none I have seen have shown it in such an obvious and everyday context. The characters in this film for the most part are not bad people, nor uneducated, nor malicious. However they do commit acts of racism and ignorance, small and large, based on the stereotypes and presumptions they have in their mind from personal experience or from the media. The film then goes on to show how even the smallest slip of the tongue, a lazy comment here or there can go on to have drastic impacts.<br/><br/>The film never becomes preachy at any time nor does it try to impose any views on the audience. It shows in a matter of fact way, exactly the sort of things that happen everyday and exactly the sort of things we hear and sometimes say or think about people, just because of the preconception we have due to their apparent race.<br/><br/>I work in a job where I come into contact with literally hundreds of foreign people, people of a different racial background to myself and people of many diverse cultures every single day. I wish I could show this film to all of my colleagues as the amount of pre-judgement I hear muttered or even see practised while working with these people is scary. This film would show certain colleagues of mine that what they think is a harmless remark, or even think that a view they hold is valid because they think they know something about a particular race of people, is the worst kind of judgement that they can ever make.<br/><br/>Go watch this film right now."

","A movie so honest it holds you prisoner to your own conscience. It forces you to decapitate your actions and intentions to find the depths of reality and truth.We all feel helpless and victimize to the film and surrender willingly just to enable us all to 'Crash'.The script is no less than genius, the exceptional work of academy award winner Paul haggis. He is able to pierce us deep into our souls with his honesty of lines such as ""you think you know who you are, you have no idea"". The honesty and integrity of this pure movie is enlightened by the performances of this 'A' class cast. They find the essence of these characters struggles and bring them to life with one drop of a tear, one silent distressed scream, one line, one word. Crash."

","I really thought this was an excellent movie. First of all to all those people who bashed Ludicrous, let me just say that though his acting wasn't brilliant, it wasn't more good than bad. I think he has to be commended on taking such a role when other rappers turned actors are doing roles like xxx or the longest yard. I thought the part where he was accusing hip hop of being racist showed to what point he was mature about his role choice. I can't say that I am a particular fan of his music and yet I don't understand why people wouldn't give him a chance. As for people who say that intermingled stories have already been done, so what???? Of course intermingled stories have already been done, but this movie is about much more. This movie is about how each man and woman leads his or her life. It's about as Thoreau would say: ""Leading a life of quiet desperation."" I thought many moments of the movie were poignant, and I think that this movie should be followed by deep personal reflection. My gf complained that the movie was a bit improbable, especially the too high level of racism. I think that this movie is slightly exaggerated but that this is voluntary and necessary. Sure not everyone is racist, but at the same time many of the scenes could happen and we are shown only those scenes in the broad world that is L.A. I think what I liked most about this movie was that there was a mixture of self-actualization and self-degradation. By that I mean that some characters reached a higher moral understanding but some sunk into the hate. It wasn't a happy ending type of movie, nor a good things happen to good people in the end. I think the Ryan Phillipe and the Don Cheadle parts of the story were important because they showed that sometimes men who seem like the ""good guys"" can in the end fall into desperation. I think that this movie was able to avoid any of your typical archetype characters that I hate so much in movies. One last thing, the twist with the duds was magnificent. I thought I had it all figured out, and then...... Really great movie, a must see......"

If this had been the other way around and shown all the factual racist motivated incidents that have been perpetrated on whites, there would have been riots all over the country and anyone that had anything to do with the movie would have had to apologize and the movie would have been banned all across the country. I'm sure the people who made it are saying that this is a ""statement"" about the inhumanity towards the ""minority's"".

","This movie has a very complex and incoherent plot (if any), and is hard to follow from beginning to end. There's so many mini-plots running simultaneously that the scene and characters changes too frequently to keep track of. I just finished watching it about five minutes ago, and I still have no idea what I just saw. The movie leaves many loose ends and the viewer feels dissatisfied with the explanations that were given to those that were explained at all. Poor acting performances from Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser (who are actually only in the movie for probably 10-15 minutes all up). Not such a bad performance from Matt Dillon, but the character role he played seemed a little too unrealistic. I mean really, what's the chances that a crooked cop could feel up an innocent victim one day and then have to save that very same person from a car wreck the next day? Seems a little far fetched. This movie was nothing more than a wasted two hours, and I don't recommend it to anyone."

","I feel a plot point in which the story had a chance to develop more and didn’t is when Ryan Philippe is requesting a new cop car because he doesn’t like to ride with his current bigoted partner, Matt Dillon. He approaches the police of chief, who is black, and they both acknowledge that Ryan’s partner is a racist prick. The police chief gives Ryan the option to write a full report on his partners racist actions or to admit to a false digestive problem so he could ride alone. “It’s your decision. You can put your career and mine on the line in pursuit of a just cause. Or you can admit to having an embarrassing problem of personal nature.” I feel that the embarrassing problem of a personal nature the chief is referring to is really Ryan’s passive stance when witnessing an injustice to save himself. It relates to the guilty by association complex. If Ryan would have acted out against racism at the risk of his job, the films message would have had much stronger impact and even a call to action directed towards the audience."

While I found the concept of the movie interesting, I felt like it could have been done so much better.<br/><br/>To begin, the movie ended with unanswered questions that just left me frustrated. I wanted justice for Graham's brother, but the movie ended without any word about what happened with that. I found that unnerving considering the movie began with Graham standing at the crime scene. What I did like about this movie though was the lone character development in Ludicrous' character, Anthony. I can't believe I am saying this, but I actually liked Ludicrous' performance because to me, it felt real and in the end I felt proud of his actions.<br/><br/>Overall, while Crash really tries to be honest, there were endless plot holes and scenes that were over-dramatic and underacted, to me this isn't an Oscar worthy film."

","""Crash"" is good on one side and bad on the other. The script and the script. One part delivers great moments and lines but there comes the erasing of all true and original ideology in this kind of movies. Stereotypes. Crash is very pale, weak in presenting the characters. None is a hero, none really redeems itself, all are crayon daft attempts of interesting characters that go nowhere but near the common place and repeated racism. Sugar sweet racism, no real hard based hate. This is what Hollywood believes happens in the streets.<br/><br/>The choral story fails in presenting too many stories in too little time and making a sudden, unprepared joining knot. The stories aren't truly related. It appears they are; but if you think it over it's just a first Good impression. This movie gets worse when you think it over in your head.<br/><br/>Stereotypes, cheap shots, easy, cheap feelings. The bad side. Some good performances, good scenes, the bright one.

Previously I handed that to either Rocky (because its competition of All The President's Men, Network, Taxi driver and Bound for Glory were all far superior) or Shakespeare In Love (Saving Private Ryan was INFINITELY better). Crash though does not deserve any sort of consideration at all. It is smug, pretentious and has more ridiculous and heavy handed plot twists than any major movie I ever saw.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* Example: Two cops stop a car driven by a black couple. The bigoted white cop proceeds to fondle the woman as he ""frisks"" her as the husband asks politely to be allowed to go with just a warning. The cop lets them go. His partner is repulsed and asks for a transfer. Later on the bigoted cop rescues the very same woman from a car wreck nanoseconds before the car explodes. Still later the partner picks up a black hitch hiker and then gets angry at him presumably for laughing at him. The black man protests that he was not laughing at him and for some reason digs in his pocket. The ""good"" cop tells him to take his hand from his pocket. When the black man doesn't do it fast enough the cop shoots and kills him only to discover the black man was reaching not for a gun but for a St. Christopher medal! PUH-LEEZE! Stupid ridiculous garbage made worse because it lured me in with a very promising first third that proceeded to go quickly and steadily downhill.

"FilmSchoolWriter","9","3","8","30 June 2006"," Excellent and heart breaking- - so why didn't I give it a 10?
","Few films have ever succeeded in breaking my heart; and Crash is one of them. This film is brilliant and it breaks your heart to watch it. I haven't seen any of the other nominees for the 2006 Best Picture Oscar so I have no idea how it compares, but Crash is indeed wonderful.<br/><br/>The entire cast does an amazing job. Their performances (as individuals and as a whole) are stunning and inspired. There is not a single performance that I was able to find a problem with, and that surprised me. For one, it is a colossal ensemble piece, you would expect one of them to back down at least once. But they never do. In fact, some of the actors have redeemed themselves in my eyes. Most particularly, Ryan Phillipe as Henderson. He doesn't mumble, and his character isn't the sort of pathetic, self assertive, slime ball that I'm used to seeing him as. All the performances are excellent, but there are a few in particular that I would like to point out: Matt Dillon as Officer John Ryan. He plays the most disgusting, racist, bigot that ever existed. His anger (at himself, at his father, for his father) wells up inside until he sees no way to relieve it other than to be racist. He molests a black woman without a second thought. And then, he tries to do the right thing, only to find that his past actions have an affect on people, so much that they are unable to forgive him for some things. Another performance is Don Cheadle as Graham Waters. A black detective from the inner city who has risen to a level far above his beginnings. As much as he hates his past, he is still connected to it, as he takes care of his druggie mother, and shields her from what her youngest son has become. Sandra Bullock as Jean Cabot. Where's Miss Conjeniality now? She plays an afraid, lonely, and prejudiced wife, who feels as if she's always angry, but without a reason. I have a whole new respect for her acting abilities. My final favorite performance goes to Michael Pena as Daniel. An honest, law abiding man trying to make a life for his young daughter, away from the violence that surrounds their life. His role as a caring father is perfect, and it breaks my heart.<br/><br/>My hat goes off to Paul Haggis. I cannot even imagine making this movie. The camera angles are wonderful, but I really loved the transitions. Weird, I know, but I do love them. They are not abrupt, there are no dissolves, or old school transitions. They are all smooth, flowing from one scene to the next flawlessly. They help to keep the film moving at a quick pace. The script is astounding as well, so my hat goes off to Robert ""Bobby"" Moresco as well as Haggis. I cannot even fathom writing this screenplay. The entire premise is so complex, that I just have to give it a standing ovation. The dialog flows and every single one of the characters are created perfectly. They come alive for us on screen. They *are* alive for us. There are so many twists and turns of the plot (just as with real life), that you are sucked in. I love, even though it kills me, the plot twist that happens to Henderson. That kills me. The young, white cop, fighting for equality, who does the one thing he hates. It's one of the truest moments I have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>And that brings me to the reason that I am unable to give Crash a perfect 10. As superb as it is, the acting, the direction, the writing, it is flawed in too many ways - too many for me just to over look. Crash fails to wrap up many of the loose ends that its multiple story lines are bound to have. And it's a shame too. I want to know how Henderson handles what he did. I want to know what was really going on between Rick and Karen and how he breaks that to Jean, or if he just lets it slide. But all in all, Crash is a gem. I loved it, and I give it an extremely high 9/10."

Its a personal favorite of mine, because i found the characters to be very interesting, the screenplay was amazing to me, and i thought it was very believable. I didn't find it contrived, I actually thought it was very open to interpretation, it kinda argues that not only white people are racist, that everybody has racist attitudes at times. Its cinematography, score and editing were perfect, everything involved with his project was to my liking. The cinematography and score both give a perfect commmentary to whats going on in the story. THis is just perfect film-making, none of the arguments i have heard that attack this film are logical. Its not contrived, actually I've heard a lot of different interpretations of whats going on here. Its not overacted, or underwritten, its pefect. Haggis did a very good job with this amazing ensemble cast, and i think films like this deserve to win best picture... even in a year with other great films such as Cinderella Man, Walk The Line and Munich. My favorite performance came from Don Cheadle, but i found Michael Pena, Larenz Tate, Matt Dillon and Terrence Howard to be fantastic as well. The whole cast shined. This is a great film, by all means! 10/10"
"Don Muvo","10","3","8","29 May 2006"," Finally, another important movie
","Paul Haggis is a gifted writer. You can read his biography here http://imdb.com/name/nm0353673/bio. I heard this was an inspired movie and it has won 26 awards in total. None of this prepared me for the hard-edged reality this movie dishes up. It has some of the same feel as Memento, but this movie has more of a Hollywood look, and less of the quirkiness of Memento. I apologize for giving it a 10 rating despite the fact that it has production flaws. It's just that there isn't anything better out there, and at least one film deserves to get a 10. Haggis has proved that he can direct a great film on a budget, and should be getting even more financial support for his projects in the future.<br/><br/>The film is an ensemble piece that argues that, in a world with Political Correctness, no one is really safe. In LA is where it all happens, about every 5 to 10 years or so, it even snows, at least somewhere, in LA. This film is about what happens one evening when it snows, and during the 24 hours leading up to it. Four of the main characters are members of the LAPD, two others are the District Attourney and his wife. After this is a film maker and his wife, an Iranian shopkeeper and his daughter, a Mexican-American man and his daughter, and two street hoodlums. The script and camera make plenty of use of parallelism and foreshadowing. For the most part the story pivots and weaves amongst these 14 characters, allowing our minds to make whatever connections we find most suitable. We may side for or against any of the characters at any one time, but if we do, it is merely a temporary illusion that has allowed us to do that, an illusion as apparitional as race itself.<br/><br/>The Crash, which occurs, is merely a metaphor for the life-changing event which will occur in the life of most of the main characters. A transformation, in each case, that was ""meant"" to happen.<br/><br/>In the end, almost all of the survivors have undergone a transformation, and not merely a ""spiritual"" transformation. The transformation is usually that their life has changed and they will never be the same person again that they were before the ""Crash"". One of the deeper interpretations of this movie may be that we should perhaps be someone other than who we are, but we have not yet realized the reality that exists within us because we have ignored or suppressed it day after day in our quest for a peaceful, secure lifestyle.<br/><br/>You can place this movie next to Fargo and Casablanca in your collection, and be assured, it will not wear out its welcome."

","Crash convincingly surpasses all of the competition while reviving the true meaning of cinematography and breathes new life into the essence of drama.<br/><br/>I have seen a plethora of critically acclaimed box office hits recently and so far 'Crash' is on a small list of movies that left me at the edge of my seat clutching the remote for dear life. How much more witty can the writers of that film get!! No special effects and grand sets! Just good old-fashioned acting. This movie addresses real issues that are very prevalent in society today and it shows us the irony of life. It reveals to us how we are all in some way intertwined and that life is a fragile thing in a fragile world and faith in God is the only firm solution. It exposes our prejudices(all of us, black, white, Asian, Latin...), prompting us to realize that none is no better than the other. All of us need companionship and all of us need love."
"basrutten","9","3","8","21 May 2006"," Excellent ensemble movie that really hits a couple of nerves
","Once very while, a movie comes along that really makes you think about (Western) society, a society where things often look just fine on the surface but once you look deeper, the opposite is sometimes the case. One of these fairly rare movies is ""Crash"", a movie that expertly shows that things like racism, discrimination and prejudice are still alive and kicking in a civilized society.<br/><br/>The best part of ""Crash"" is probably that it does all of this in a way that feels very realistic and believable. I felt that the majority of the situations that occur in the movie could (and do sometimes) happen in the real world.<br/><br/>It's also noteworthy that ""Crash"" doesn't threat its subject matter in a black-and-white matter. This isn't a movie where there are good guys and bad guys, instead there are many shades of gray: the initially idealistic cop turns eventually turns out to be biased after all, while the racist pig turns out not to be so evil after all, and so on.<br/><br/>All in all, I think ""Crash"" presents a number of very interesting moral dilemma's (would you jeopardize your career in order to stop discrimination?) and touches a couple of sensitive spots.<br/><br/>What also helps a whole lot are the generally very strong performances by a very diverse cast of talented actors. Not all of them are known for serious roles (Sandra Bullock, Ludicrous) but even they do a convincing job here. Even though none of the characters get much screen time (this is a real ensemble movie) you do get to care about them, especially during some very intense and emotional scenes.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a great ensemble movie, with strong performances, and a realistic and thought-provoking plot ****1/2 out of *****"

","One reviewer said that 'societies stereotypes' were effecting peoples judgments. He missed the whole point of the movie. If that is what the movie said this would be just another Hollywood blasé movie about 'racism', which in itself just rehashes old stereotypes, usually about white people (All in the Family).<br/><br/>No, the power of this movie is that it shows that there is VALIDITY TO THE STEREOTYPES. And people suffer from these truths, they get robbed by a black guy, or cheated by an Asian, or find out the Russians next door are the new mafia. These stereotypes AREN'T created ex nihilo, out of nothing. They start out with a foundation of fact.<br/><br/>So there is a foundation of evil truth. This evil is then compounded when people who are EXCEPTIONS to the STEREOTYPE try to make their way in the world. They have a chip on their shoulder that is compounded by their own clumsy efforts to throw that chip off and others who mistake them for the stereotype. These are the true victims of racism in society  the exceptions.<br/><br/>The only true universal truths in the movie are: 1) there is good and bad in everyone and the bad is valid  as is the good. 2) the Universe is arbitrary or, as the Bible put it, the rain falls on the good and evil alike.<br/><br/>The movie itself demonstrates its greatness by inspiring discussion like this. I am sure there will be viewers who disagree with my viewpoint  passionately. Great! That shows what a great picture this is.<br/><br/>If you're sick to death about 'racism' and automatically tune out when the subject comes up (and many people are fed up) don't let that stop you from seeing this movie. Its not the usual Hollywood stereotype of 'all white people bad, everyone who's not white is good'. It is an honest look at race in America (and refreshing at that) and our society today. Not the simple, one dimensional 'white man bad' type of film of the past. Because of that, because of its unflinching and honest look at the truth, it has power.<br/><br/>Besides its courageous look at racial truth, what also makes this film succeed is that artistically it is a triumph. In its own way, it is tragically beautiful, a masterpiece of film."

There is undeniable truth in ""Crash"", people in general do have stereotypes towards other races and whether we like it or not, racism is everywhere.

"azeemak","1","3","8","17 August 2005"," Reader, I walked out
","Well, I seem to be out of step with the majority view here, but I have to say that I HATED this film, despite the good things there were in it (some good dialogue amidst the schematic, mouthpiece-for-the-writer stuff and some good acting, especially from Don Cheadle and Thandie Newton). Although I accept that the film was trying to say important things, for me it simply didn't work at any level, because of the writer/director's shouty, showy style; ""I'm saying something REALLY significant here; and look, all the people are prejudiced, not just whites, isn't that edgy; and oh, did you see what I did there with that snazzy editing?"" I don't like being preached at, and that's what I felt with Crash.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH* Like one or two other reviewers on this site, I was also bothered by the relentless contrivances Haggis uses to get characters into the same space, many of which simply make no sense; and the ludicrous things some of them do once there: what was the director doing driving through that dodgy neighbourhood? How did the irate Iranian man find the locksmith's address (yes, Haggis thoughtfully showed a shot of a circled address in a phone book, but come on, how many people called 'D Ruiz' are there in LA??)? And I didn't believe for one moment that he would have fired the gun once he saw the girl. AND another thing: blanks at that range would still have caused injury or even death.<br/><br/>My biggest objection to this film is that nearly every character is a cipher. Don Cheadle's mother is straight out of Central Casting, with one incredibly clichéd line (""I was doin' real good""); Sandrea Bullock's uptight WASP was even more annoying than she was meant to be; you just KNEW that Matt Dillon's racist LAPD officer would turn out to be a Great Cop.<br/><br/>Crash (not to be confused with the David Cronenberg film, despite an opening speech which gives a none-too-subtle nod to it) has been compared to Magnolia, for an obvious reason: the multi-stranded plot. I think it also shares Magnolia's overweening self-importance and lack of humility; with its constant attempts to wrong-foot the viewer's expectations, it paradoxically becomes tiresomely predictable.<br/><br/>*MORE SPOILERS* By the time of Ryan Philippe's confrontation with Larenz Tate, which, again, I did not find remotely credible - surely Tate's character would have realised how spooked the other was, and *explained* why he was laughing, rather than reach into his pocket, thereby signing his own death warrant - I'd had enough. I didn't care what happened, as these people did not come alive."
"kaanthan","10","3","8","13 August 2005"," Provocative
","This movie centres around race and racial issues which arise in the multicultural city of Los Angeles. Director/writer Paul Haggis aims to do this by interlinking several mini-stories...and does so brilliantly.<br/><br/>The cast is superb, all turning in brilliant performances, including rapper Ludicrous who has shown he has a future in film. Perhaps the most powerful performance came from Ryan Phillippe, whose character personifies the message that Crash tries to get across; we are capable of anything, both in views and actions.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis has shown that his transition from TV to film is more than successful, with Crash and his screenplay work on Million Dollar Baby occupying #68 and #67 respectively in IMDb's Top 250. In my personal opinion, I feel that this is close to, if not the best movie I have ever seen. I am not aware of the requirements of a film being considered for the Academy Awards (this is a 2004 film...should it have been considered at the 2004 Oscars?), but I think this film should receive mentions.<br/><br/>It's unlikely that Best Actor/Actress will come up, mainly due to the nature of several stories and no one actor/actress predominating over the others. However, Best Film or Screenplay nominations, if not awards should be possible."

","I can't Believe it, this is film shook me like no other has for a very long time. Gripping and Compelling, A must see for all.<br/><br/>Following A day in the life of about ten people from different backgrounds in LA, The film Portrays society in a poetic, yet strikingly real light. The tactfully crafted dialogue of humour and feeling, makes a bold statement; unrivalled by any film of the last year.<br/><br/>I often struggle to get into films that have no single leading characters but instead nine or ten, parts making up the film. This seems to Pull it off very well, down partly to the fine acting, but mainly owing to the hugely talented directing and script writing - If you ever want to see character development in such a short time, this film is awesome.<br/><br/>Crash is a cross between The Deer Hunter and American History X, with a little bit of Forrest Gump thrown in as well. A Possible Classic in Years to come?"
"larajane","10","3","8","23 July 2005"," Superlative acting, even if there is a hint of fromage :)
","I was floored by this film, having seen it without having heard of it before. Like other reviewers here, I noticed the similarity to Magnolia, but since that is possibly my favourite film of all time, I am unlikely to see that as a negative! I was amazed that it was a directorial debut.<br/><br/>What impressed me initially was the acting. The smallest exchanges were given a gravitas that I find too often missing from 'drama' movies, where only the 'Oscar moments' are performed and filmed with such visible care. It seemed to me like a series of vignettes, that even on their own, outside of the greater context of the film, felt important and special, and carried messages. I thought Chris Bridges (Ludicris) was great, and both Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon turned in complex and brave performances.<br/><br/>Any film that makes me laugh aloud and burst into tears is powerful to me, because I think it's really hard for a film-maker to do both convincingly. Some of the dialogues were sharply witty, and yet didn't come off as smug. The emotional high points weren't forced or clichéd (well, with the possible exception of the little girl : 'I will protect you Daddy' - but who cares, I was bawling at that point anyway!), and when it was done, I was left feeling incredibly moved by some of the most powerful scenes.<br/><br/>I do think the film will receive some criticism for what will be perceived as overt 'worthiness' or politically correctness, and I can see why in a sense, because there is just a hint of white middle class guilt edging in. However, I really couldn't see how this could have been done with a lighter touch, without losing the significance. To me it was about compromise more than just racism or corruption, how we all get chipped away at every day, and at some point we have to take responsibility for it, and change it or let it go on. There was redemption, but at a price, and even the ending, which had the teensiest whiff of cheese about it, left me smiling :) Oh, great soundtrack too."
"julianobubo","10","3","8","5 July 2005"," The Truest movie ever!
","This movie is amazing. It connects many people together and is centered on racial stereotypes in America. the races/ethnicities addressed are Black, White, Latino, Chinese, Persian etc. The film basically shows how one Crash can lead into several seemingly unrelated incidents meeting each other. There is no central character in the movie, however brilliant performances from each one of them. Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who in the end learns a valuable lesson, Luda-cris makes a breakthrough performance as an over-apprehensive black man, with a distaste for white people. Sandra Bullock, Tarrence Dashon Howard and Ryan Phillipe are also exceptional. You cannot understand the movie if you start watching it halfway, as connections to events or things said earlier have to be made. The movie leaves one with a weird feeling whatever race one may be. Good work Haggis!!!"
"ohmycannoli","10","3","8","3 July 2005"," Not just a film, an experience...
","There is nothing like this film. So far I've seen it 3 times and I will catch it one more time. It touches on sensitive racial themes and ignores that they are, in fact, sensitive. It is raw and creative, and the ways the stories unfold and connect in the end is imaginative and inspired, and the entire film is quite reminiscent (in structure) of Magnolia (which happens to be my favorite movie of all time). The characters are rich and varied (even though a few are underdeveloped), and each one plays an essential part in the film. One of the most unique things about the film is the way it portrays people who do ruthless or detestable things as human beings, which tests the way we view these characters. You will never be able to look at a one-dimensional racist character in another movie in the same way again, because you'll find yourself wishing they were more fleshed out like in Crash. Paul Haggis is obviously a wonderful story teller, and I will be rushing to the store when Million Dollar Baby comes out, as well as this. It is worth every penny you could spend on it, and I've spent some money on it. I suggest everyone go see this, whether your black, white, or anything in between. It will amaze you."
"rwp86","10","3","8","21 June 2005"," Excellent Movie, one of the best of '05
","Crash is a movie that almost anyone can enjoy because it delves into characters and brings the spectator an incredibly beautiful visual experience with incredible camera work by James Muro and superb story telling by Paul Haggis. While Haggis did once create Walker Texas Ranger, something that can never be forgiven, he did also create Million Dollar Baby, so that tells you something about his scale. The most amazing and interesting thing about this movie, is that it takes the actors and puts them in roles many people wouldn't expect them to have the ability to perform well in. Matt Dillon easily presents his greatest performance on film and Don Cheadle does a great job in not only acting but bringing the film to the screen the right way. The most surprising role in the film is the work of Michael Pena who delivers a very powerful and believable performance. The one thing that almost kills this movie however is the constant banter from Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges mouth. The constant racist jokes from most actors and paranoid conspiracy theories spilled out of Ludicrous' mouth are enough to take the spectator out of the movie entirely. Many of the jokes are in fact hilarious, but they often go way to far as to have to tell them once every 3-5 scenes, turning the film into saturated crap in some parts. However take a great job from both crew and cast and a very well written screen play, and add Mark Isham's incredible score and you have a Class A film."
"bjukic66","10","3","8","10 June 2005"," a great film
","There are so many reasons why this is a truly outstanding film. One of the less talked about ones is its ability to create a tremendous amount of realistic tension without spilling much blood or showing direct acts of violence. How truly refreshing!! In addition, the stories are put together in a very clever fashion. Do not believe those negative reviews that claim that there are too many characters and that all interrelated stories are too hard to follow. It is simply not true. Any person of average intelligence will be able to tie all the loose ends if they watch attentively. Yes, this film does demand our attention and concentration, but that should be a good thing, don't you think? Most of the characters are completely believable, albeit some of them are pure sketches, and again there are too many too good looking women in position and occupations that are not occupied by those kind in real life. (On the other hand, three cheers for HMO lady for looking exactly like someone who works for an HMO). All in all, it is a truly great accomplishment of the kind Hollywood is able to churn out at a rate of about 1 per year or less."
"erialc0","Null","3","8","18 May 2005"," You think you know who they are. You have no idea.
","By the end of Crash, it was clear to me that the movie's tagline can be turned on the audience as easily as on the characters. The thing about this film that really got to me is that the actors, the writers, the director don't allow you to feel comfortable with yourself. You are forced to re-evaluate each character over and over throughout the course of this complex story, until you're left with only a partial understanding of the difficult and often unexpected decisions both likable and despicable people can make.<br/><br/>Crash weaves together the stories of several groups of people from many races and levels of society in Los Angeles. A Persian store owner is accused of being a terrorist sympathizer. A young black man, working with a friend, rails against the injustice of stereotyping against blacks while stealing cars. The LA district attorney tries to balance his chances of winning an upcoming election with a possibly racially motivated killing. These and several more plot lines run tangetally to each other, touching at significant points to illustrate just how thin the line between right and wrong really is--and how much moral grey area one can fit there.<br/><br/>The acting is tight and superb. The fact that there are so many ""main"" means that no one person dominated the film, but it also meant that we ere given a Hemingway-esquire treatment of each--short and to the point, without wasted and unconvincing emoting, or sloppy tug-at-the-heartstrings moments.<br/><br/>Recommended whole-heatedly."
"bob the moo","Null","5","17","8 September 2005"," A flawed narrative cannot put a dent in the strength of the characters, themes, acting and all round writing
","A minor car accident is the end of the story. It is here where a group of strangers of all races and classes connect, whether they know it or not.<br/><br/>It is a simple premise that sets up a Short Cuts style story of multiple characters and stories that only have brief narrative connections but yet, in this film, have significant thematic links. In this case it is race and this is what the film is about  not a car crash but a personal picture of a city that is split along lines of race, class, wealth and, simply put, the fact that people are people (bad and good) no matter where they fall in these categories. For this reason some people may find the story itself to occasionally be contrived, it goes to extremes, it pushes the action beyond what can easily be swallowed and every link in the chain is about colour. However to me this was not a problem because I understood that this is what the film was about and the focus was not this story, not other aspects of the characters lives (eg not a political thriller about a cover up) but about their views on race and the impacts they have.<br/><br/>As such it is relentlessly interesting and thoughtful and Haggis has crafted a screenplay that works on so many levels. It tackles many issues and it doesn't pander to any one ethnic group  doesn't allow poverty to be an excuse or privilege a let-off. The film is in the characters and again it is impressive how well Haggis has, with so little time on each, avoiding clichés and created characters we care about and are able to easily understand. Haggis doesn't give answers  everyone gets their space to be complex, everyone gets their chance to struggle. If I did have to take a message it would be that ""people are good or bad no matter what colour they are"" but writing this sounds so corny and I assure you that if the film does deliver a message, it certainly doesn't force it down your throat. Yes the coincidences are all very tidy and unlikely at times, while the action does go to extremes to set things up, but if you are focusing on this aspect of the film to the point where it bothers you, then you are probably not allowing yourself to think around the theme  which is what Haggis is focusing on after all.<br/><br/>The cast are impressive on paper but few scream out as superb leading actors, so I was surprised by how many were actually very strong, and kept the script from creating clichés (even covering the extremes of the narrative well). To pick one for praise is hard but Dillon works well with a complex character that you hear on the radio phone-ins all the time, that forgotten, oppressed minority group, the poor white man. Dillon doesn't force his point, he is honest to the character and he is excellent  you hate his views while also agreeing with them. A slimmed Bullock is also very impressive, she is fully in touch with her frightened, angry character and the script trusts her to do a lot herself  which she is more than able to. I have never knowingly liked Howard but here he is very good, bringing the conflicts within his character to the surface without being so crude as to use words to spell it all out (a compliment that applies to most of the cast actually). He is supported well by Newton, who has a smaller role than I expected but was still impressive. Fraser is solid and reliable, which is all the film asks for; he won't win awards but with such talent around him, it is no surprise not to have him shine. Cheadle is as good as he is proving he can be of late  his character is flawed regardless of colour and he is the key to a lot of the point (he is also blessed with the funniest line in the film). One of the biggest surprises to me was Ludicrous, a man whose music is so unashamedly unpolitical and booty-worshiping that I expected very little of him. However he avoids cliché really well and turns in a performance that deserves to be noted in the face of so many of his peers churning out offensive and demeaning ""ethnic"" comedies. Phillippe is another guy I just don't rate but even he is good here  his character is the ""good guy who sees no colour"" but assumes the very worst when pushed and is left with nothing to cling to; it was a challenge and I was very impressed by how well he pulled it off. Tate is more relaxed but he is natural and that is what was required. Support from David, Esposito, Finchtner and others is all good and helps give the feel of a film deep in quality, which it is. I know I have missed some of the cast out  but I have a word limit and I can't do them all justice within that.<br/><br/>Overall this is not the film to come to looking for a simple, acceptable narrative because it is here that it is weakest. All the stories play race issues as their central theme and the events are often extreme and unconvincing. However this is not the focus  the themes of race, empathy, flawed people (not races) and other issues are what we are there for and the script does well to address those without forcing them down our throats while also avoiding cliché and making good characters with very little time. In this area he is helped by a great cast all hitting the target producing a flawed film that is also very strong indeed."
"abisio","10","5","17","7 May 2005"," Just go and see this movie; do not ask or loose even one minute
","It is not fair to say that CRASH is the best 2005 movie. CRASH is the best movie of the last five years or probably the last decade.<br/><br/>CRASH can be compared with Altman's SHORTCUTS or with MAGNOLIA; however is better than the first one and far-far better than the second is. While those movies try to explain the human relations in a metaphorical or intellectual way; sometimes using images without any real significance (like the frog's rain in MAGNOLIA) or long and sometimes boring monologues (just to justify some actor's ego); or focus mostly on a mid-to-high class, CRASH use real day to day situations and people, from every social level.<br/><br/>Trying to tell the history is difficult. Let's say that a chain of events create temporary situations between unlike to be together humans beings. A wealthy couple is robbed from his SUV in a rich LA district; looking for the car a frustrated stops a black couple and abuse the woman in front of her husband. This humiliation causes a crisis in the couple and a meditation of ethnic rights. Similar abuse an Arab in a store (the store clerk calls him OSAMA and blames him for throwing 747 in American buildings).<br/><br/>The first half hour of the movie, looks like everything is about racial conflicts; which is somewhat a tricky subject even when the arguments are acceptable, but suddenly more twist of events, shows another side on almost every character.<br/><br/>The characters are so well defined (even in very short scenes) that at least three situations generate more horror or suspense than all RINGS movies together (without using any ghost).<br/><br/>The acting is outstanding. Every actor put his or her ego aside and play their part no matter how risky they are. Sandra Bullock is very good as the hysterical and racist wife goes credible from the queen of the bitches to break your heart in the last scene. Even better is the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>This movie is about people, about both sides of the coin. It carries the most important meditation about the human being in less than two hours. Sadly IS TOO GOOD TO WIN Oscar but at least give it a commercial success; so who knows, probably Hollywood starts doing GOOD MOVIES."

One is built from nothing but a desire to be superior and the other is built from centuries of injustice and suffering. Can a white person pin an act of violence to black people? Of course. Can a white person ever say he's known what it's like to be the person who will always have to work a little harder because of the color of his skin? Nope! This convoluted and often downright stupid movie was nothing but a guaranteed way to get an Oscar by being ""edgy"" if you can call it that and shoving a very heavy handed message down the throats of America.

Across the board there are no weak links in the acting. To note every actor would take too much space in these 'mini' reviews, yet not to mention at least several would be criminal.<br/><br/>Ludicrous and Larenz Tate shine as young black carjackers who talk more about politics and civil rights rhetoric than their 'job', and see their own contradiction as playing to their racial stereotypes. On the other side of the law, Matt Dillon excels as a morally challenged police officer, who shows the best and worst of the LAPD, and is consumed by personal issues away from the job.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe, in, I must admit, his first role I have seen since Cruel Intentions, plays a rookie cop trying to make a difference in the world, and plays the character extremely well. Sandra Bullock, in a role a million miles away from Congenialty, exquisitely expresses the fears and anger of post 9/11 white America, and Brendan Fraser is one of this reviewer's favourite actors, whether in serious roles or others.<br/><br/>But if anyone can be considered a central character in this stunning ensemble cast, it is Don Cheadle. In this movie he plays a detective all too well aware of the racial politics in the department and City Hall, trying to do his job well, and having pressure from his mother to look out for his brother.<br/><br/>Throw in a middle class black couple, who have a very bad experience with the police, leading to marital difficulties and wondering whether they will ever 'fit in'; an Iranian family victimised for being 'ragheads' and not knowing why the perpetrators have got Persians and Arabs mixed up; a Hispanic father just trying to provide for and look out for his family, and this is a searing view of the American melting pot.<br/><br/>Very much an impact movie, and nowhere during the movie can you anticipate or predict what is going to happen next or how it will all end.

","Paul Haggis has proved that he is a great writer with his adaptation of F.X. O'Tooles works into ""Million Dollar Baby"", one of 2004's finest films. Now he proves that not only is he a great writer, but a great director as well, with ""Crash"". Like the 'tapestry' films of Robert Altman, ""Crash"" is a complex film, interweaving many different characters and stories to create a portrait of life in a big city.<br/><br/>""Crash"" takes place in Los Angeles where racism and blind hatred affect everyone's lives, whether they be taking it or dishing it out. What ""Crash"" suggests, like Altman's ""Nashville"" and ""Short Cuts"", is that the problems the characters have derive from a lack of connections with each other. None of these characters take the time to meet each other,or learn about each other. All that matters is the color of their skin and how deep their wallet goes.<br/><br/>For example, Sandra Bullock's Jean, the narcissistic wife of the DA. Jean finds it perfectly OK to turn and run from people of other ethnicities, and to treat them all like low-life thugs. She even suspects her Latino locksmith of being a gang member, and wholly believes that he will sell her keys to other gangs. If she had taken the time to meet him she would have known that Daniel is actually a family man and a model citizen. But she doesn't know him, and she doesn't care.<br/><br/>Or, how about Matt Dillon's Ryan, a cop who pulls over a black couple and molests the wife, Christine, on the side of the road. Not because he hates them for being black, but because of his frustration in trying to deal with a black HMO agent just minutes earlier. Ryan's father is suffering from a urinary tract infection and can't sleep due to the pain. When he contacts the HMO to see if they'll cover pain medication, Ryan winds up talking to a black woman who tells him the medicine isn't covered. Ryan later visits her office and tells her there are at least five or six white men who should have her job and don't, thanks to affirmative action.<br/><br/>There are many other stories and characters in ""Crash"", too many to cover in detail here. The black and Latino detectives/lovers with severe racial tension between them; the eloquent, pseudo-existentialist carjackers (my personal favorite characters); the Persian shop owners who are mistaken for Arabs and treated like terrorists; the Asian immigrant couple who wind up in two separate car accidents; the list goes on. There are so many diverse people to meet here, it can seem overwhelming. With so many characters, it is amazing that writer/director Haggis manages to give them all time to become three-dimensional characters in the film's 113 minute running time. What's more amazing is that he manages to tie up every story so well. By allowing the story lines to bleed into each other, Haggis makes the connections they so desperately need.<br/><br/>The film's climax gives the audience a chance to see that every bad person can be good, and every good person can go wrong. It all depends on who they meet, and how they connect. It also reminds us that these characters will probably wind up the way they were before they crashed together, but they'll at least be wiser for what they experienced.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since a film stood out and demanded attention like ""Crash"" does. ""Crash"" is a big, bold film that will grab you instantly and won't let go until it takes you on one long, complicated, and powerful journey through the mess we call life. With Oscar-caliber performances, a brilliant screenplay, and a master in the makings at the helm, ""Crash"" is a major contender for film of the year. This is a sure-fire best picture nominee in my book, and you can quote me on that."

","I always wonder, are minorities violent because they are castaway, or are they castaway because they are violent?. Crash did not answer the question, but raised it in a terrific way. The script is so strong and people are connected in a perfect way. American society is a mix of different ethnics and cultures, and they have to live together or there will be a crash. A tough crash as we saw. I cried at the end of the movie when Sandra Bullok hug her maid and tells her that she is her best friend. Even though the message was too direct, but it was so touching. This crash was so strong that it shocked us, but it was necessary to revive us."

After that, if they saw a similar, simplified movie, something like ""Sophisticated movie for Dummies"", they say ""wow, at last we have understand what a good movie is!"".<br/><br/>However this is a bad replacement for such movies, for example, ""Amores Peros"" or ""Short Cuts"". I didn't see ""Magnolia"", which is also pointed here.<br/><br/>The movie is flat at its extreme. Even worst, it is supposed not to be flat. Compared to the ""the good guy and the bad one"" it is a step toward improvement at glance, but I still prefer ""the good and the bad"" way, because it does not pretends to be more than a fairytale.<br/><br/>Why I've seen the movie? Well, a friend gave it to us, recommending. It is not polite to doubt the friends opinion, you know. Why I've seen the whole movie? Well I hoped that maybe it became better.. It became just worst, if just only slightly. Nevertheless as pictures sequence it was not bad. This is why I put my 3 stars on it.<br/><br/>The main problem was it has no substance, it was empty, it was laughable. I mean, it should be serious, it should touch you, but it was just laughable. I didn't know it has won 3 Oscars (otherwise I would not see it all. For me an Oscara is rather a sign that the film would not be my favorite). I was also shocked to see how many folk have given so much stars. What's a pity! To make such a crap just to be liked by many.<br/><br/>The theme has to be racism or something like that, and the main idea was maybe that nobody is really so bad, or so good, everyone has the background to act so, as (s)he acts.

You've got Sandra Bullock , Brendan Fraser , Matt Dilon and rapper (lucadris) to name just a few. First thing that enters your head hopeless right?.

It is almost like watching a miracle a movie that maybe should never have been that good actually taking on perfection. The actors involved gave it everything. The roles that most of them have been waiting there whole career to be given they just didn't know it. Some die hard Roles they would later go on to nail. You'll never look at people like Matt Dilon for example the same again.

","Just when I think that the Right Wing mullahs that run this nation could not possibly be smarter than any other sort of human beings, I am proved wrong. The Los Angeles Guilty White Liberal has got to be the dumbest form of humanity going, even moreso than the inbred hillbilly. You know who I mean: the latte sipping crowd that brought you such critically lauded trash as The Hours, which plumbed every arts cliché imaginable; Monster, which revealed Feminazism's worst side (i.e.- murdering men is OK if the murderer disingenuously claims all men are bad rapists); or Million Dollar Baby, which proved that white trash are probably the only social group still open for out and out mockery. That last piece of tripe, incidentally, was penned by Paul Haggis, the man who wrote and directed this past year's Academy Award winning film of the year, Crash. Perhaps the most ridiculous, and humorous, moment comes in a cameo where television actor Tony Danza plays a TV star who wants his black costars to sound more 'black', so tells the black TV director to reshoot a scene. No one, in this day and age, is so clueless as to risk a lawsuit by speaking that way in public, yet the trio of fawning Left Wing dimwits comment on Danza's 'subtle villainy', as if needing to display not a one of them has a clue as to the word's actual definition. Yet, cluelessly written scenes like that abound, and the fact that everyone associated with this film is clueless of them is telegraphed in the film's very first scene, where Cheadle ludicrously intones that people 'crash into each other' just to feel something. Wow! Great concept for a title. Here's a better one: The Idiots Guide To Racism. Oh, wait, trademark infringement.<br/><br/>The fact is, although most human beings are idiots, in relation to their emotions, their idiocy is born of complexity, which only makes real world idiocy as racism so vexing and puzzling. But, instead of focusing on the vexing motives of people's bigotry, Haggis shows the shallowness of his understanding of bigotry, not the shallowness of bigotry itself, as well as his utter lack of ambiguity and realism in portraying his characters, their actions, and motivations. This film was two hours of pure movie hell, and one of the worst films ever made; and not in that schlocky Robot Monster nor Plan 9 From Outer Space way that can endear as years pass. It's especially so, considering that a bumper sticker would have sufficed to convey its trite message. I could literally go on for several more pages, detailing every ridiculous and phony thing in this film, and still not fully convey how truly atrocious watching this film was. It should be reviled as being every bit as bigoted and truly 'full of hatred' for humanity, as anything Rush Limbaugh, or his ilk, ever uttered. That no one in Hollywood recognized this real 'truth' unfortunately explains why this country is where it is right now, and why racism is not the problem, merely a symptom of the real ill."

Within film making this can be exploitative and demeaning if handled badly, however to tell a story with such a sensitive premise as Crash I believe that the characterisation was completely necessary to the storyline.<br/><br/>Whether we like it or not, we all have misinformed views of people and cultures that are different to our own and this film reflects that beautifully.<br/><br/>By the way, I am not Mexican and I do not live in Mexico.

I didn't expect it to be so great. Anyway, my expectations have been greatly rewarded. Everything is excellent in this movie - the play, the music by Marc Isham, the operator's work, the colors, the plot. The very idea is also very good - racism. We face it in Russia, we see it in the ISA, we come across it all around the world. Racism eats us like a rust eats the iron. And, what is especially great in this film, is the fact that those heroes who seem to be racists in the first place (like the policeman played by Matt Dillon) turn out to be kind, heroic people, and those who never seem to be any racists at all, are in fact the ones. The cameo appearances of Sandra Bullock and Brendan Frazer are second to none! Even though their roles are small, they play with such blood-chilling truthfulness that you don't hesitate to believe them. Excellent story is the one with two Afro-American brothers - one is a Cop, another is a criminal. The second one is shot by mistake and this tragedy shocks so terribly. The plot about the Iranian shop-keeper is another winner. The film is an absolute winner, an absolute master work, a true holder of all those awards and prizes."

Paul Haggis (writer of Million Dollar Baby) is at it again with this film, which is once again a triumph.<br/><br/>The script is a rich tapestry, gracefully weaving through a range of human emotions. There are several significant characters, most switching between being god guys and bad guys at some point, and Haggis manages these emotions with expertise, knowing exactly when to introduce the next piece of action in each character's story.<br/><br/>Every performance is solid, with a standout performance from Terence Howard, who epitomises good acting, and judging by this (without seeing Hustle and Flow), he probably deserved his best actor nomination at the 2006 Oscars. Honourable mention to Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, who turns in a great performance, and a big 'thumbs up' to whoever cast him in the role, his fast talking rap skills were perfect for the role.<br/><br/>The picture was very deserving of the Best Picture Oscar, and I wait in anticipation for Paul Haggis' next effort"
"Mxzplk","1","3","9","28 April 2006"," Road to Irrelevance
","Crash is the word of order that robbed the Oscar home. The devotion of Ryan (Matt Dillon) for his dad crashes with the will of the assistance programs that ignores the welfare of an aged man to inject dollars in quotas that only mask the exclusion of blacks. The always passive attitude of the Latin maid that works for lady Jean (Sandra Bullock) crashes into her solitude. As much as the incapacity of Cameron (Terrance Howard) to say ""Sorry, Chris. I love you!"" to his wife crashes into her lack for an arm that holds and protects her. And so it goes...<br/><br/>The collisions of life, where surprise and routine look each other eye-to-eye, resume itself, in the interpretation of Paul Haggis, about the daily of Shwarzenagger's California, in a structure at the shape of a mosaic. An arithmetical arrangement of losses and damages is the balance of the formal experience of the director. A negative balance. Racism doesn't lose in ""Crash"". It triumphs. And that is not mere plea of realistic filming.<br/><br/>The mosaic technique was popularized by Robert Altmen (Short Cuts, 1993) and Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, 1999). In this register, each character is a wire, entangled to each other. But the coldness of Haggis turns them into a numerical equation. In his algebra, blacks, jews, arabs and latins are divisible by the same denominator: intolerance. The white that hates the black, the black that hates the hispanic, that hates the arab, that hates the white, that as everyone else, hates everyone. But there is a variable, an unknown delta, that blocks the director of getting to the value of ""x"".<br/><br/>Ryan, at the terrific performance by Dillon, is the only character in scene that is more then just forced by the director through the clichés of cheap sociology. Paul Thomas Anderson, also cruel to his characters, didn't dissimulate anything, he attacked the characters openly, not pretending to ""understand their motives"". The racist Ryan that beats on ""niggers"" and abuses a ""bitchy"" has a reason to beat who has too much melanin in the skin: Haggis makes a mistake right there, he justifies the hate of the cop at the incongruence of the politically correct. A narrative trap to guide the character to a determined course that will justify his actions later on. A full plate for the fascists.<br/><br/>Since he doesn't go deeper on the other character in their urban tragedy, Haggis incurs into artificialism. He knows that in the land of the Governator inclusion and equality screams in agony, scream the same ""I'll be back"" consecrated by Shwarzie's characters. But does nothing for the pray of justice to echo through Hollywood.<br/><br/>Why the hack would this guy sell his film about racism by opening with such a smarty dialogue of two black youths in which one of them complains of being identified as a thug because of his color and, at the end of the scene, pulls out a gun and steals a car? As you can see, anyway you slice it, it's clear that a vote for Crash was a vote for simple-minded self-satisfaction, social relevance for dummies. To throw weight behind Brokeback, a film that genuinely challenges deep-set notions of sexuality, masculinity and love within American mythes, proved a bridge too far. The Academy would like to have us believe it has its thumb on the pulse of America, even as their choices reveal a shallow self-regard that borders on the masturbatory. The Oscars more than dropped the ball; they placed pleasant fallacy over clear-eyed truth, self-absorption over significance. Good thing Mr. Clooney made his comments early in the evening. By night's end, it became clear what path the Academy has settled on: the road to irrelevance."

This movie is flawless I must say. Humorous at times and makes you provoked and at times make you cry out with all your guts. Is it how life goes in all parts of U.S or is it only in the L.A.I thought that racial discrimination was still present only in countries like mine but I was shocked to see that people out there in the U.S are in more worse state then in ours .I love the message that this movie tried to spread that to up lift your race we should stop feeling that we were always meant to be out casted. Everyone is equal everyone should understand that .Black people are not animals that you can do what ever you like at any time .Do people in U.S have to live with fear that today I might be shot by a white man or by black man? Wasn't all men the creation of god whether it be women or men child ,white or black ,or of diff castes .Well I believe animals are better then men at least they are not hungry for their own kinds blood .Pouring each other's blood is it any worth? Once who gave rise to such discrimination are dead and gone. The only thing I didn't like in this movie is the scene where the black women is humiliated in public and if that really happens then all I say is don't you dare lay your dirty hands on a women whether she be black or white or of lower caste you disgusting pig imagine that being happening to you mother or to your daughter imagine her being molested in front of you and you aren't able to do any god damn thing I don't understand when it comes to suffering why are the women the only ones to suffer the most. If I were that black women I would have died in the car instead being of being saved by such pathetic person. If there are gonna be this kind of discrimination even in the most developed countries itself then what are we suppose to expect from our countries where there still are untouchables. People in my country would rather die than drinking water touched by the people of lower caste. How the movie tries to show the horrible thing happening behind the public eyes is so provoking specially that scene where that white man say that will put the medal on the black man to gain more vote that is disgusting bloody politician I am sure they will go to the place pathetic then hell .All in all a brilliant movie which unfolds different stories really happening around U.S and gives people living outside U.S a better view of it .And makes people think again whether U.S where we think our dreams get a chance to be true is it really a best place to live are we safe out there will our talent get recognized out there without discriminated that I am an Asian ?????

","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>Crash seems to be a love it or hate it type film but I'm in between on that. I found the themes explored here to be relevant and the movie left me moved, wound up and a bit shaken. There was not a performer here who did not deliver and the pure intensity of the performers and the film in general is enveloping from the beginning. Even if one had never heard of this film and did not know what it was about coming in, one can tell within the first five minutes what the message will be. Crash is definitely a movie with a message and it's unrelenting in it's force and energy. Throughout the two hours or so, this movie played for I don't think I moved once.<br/><br/>In spite of the positives, I can't say I really enjoyed this nor do I have a difficult time understanding why someone would not like it. Crash is really really heavy and at times brutal. I understand the people in saying that the movie is unrealistic because of all the coincidences that happen but I really think, though some of the individual stories maybe unrealistic, the complexities and attitudes of many in the film, are both realistic and sad.<br/><br/>Crash is a movie that is very uncomfortable to watch at times. There is a feeling that your eavesdropping into peoples' lives and it is almost impossible not to be a bit shaken and want to talk about the film afterward. I found the ensemble cast to be great and the film's writing to be excellent. It's an impressive film.<br/><br/>If I were to voice any negatives, it actually would not be the coincidence factor, it would be the fact that it is very difficult just to relax and enjoy the film at any moment for any length of time. Virtually every scene has either something bad happening, or the sense that something bad is right around the corner and in my opinion the musical score took away from the film, not because it wasn't a good musical score but because it seemed more suited for a horror movie. The music quickly overshadowed the film and due to the constant rising and falling of the music, there was the sense constantly that something terrible was about to happen. Almost everything seemed like foreshadowing and it was hard not to get caught up in wondering which character was about to get killed, beaten up or screamed at next. This, to me, actually took away from the movie's message because your so busy wondering about this or that, there's very little ability to just sit back and watch the film unfold.<br/><br/>In spite of the fact I didn't ENJOY this, it was a much better then average movie. I wouldn't give this the Oscar but I could see any of the performers being recognized and I really was impressed by the screenplay, the cleverness of the writing and the emotional depth of the film. All the performers(really, all of them!) were great but I must single out Matt Dillon who stunned me with one of the most intense ensemble performances I've ever seen and the chemistry of all the people working together was great. This wasn't one of the more enjoyable films of the year but it was one of the most forceful and deserves the recognition it has been getting. My vote's 8 of 10."

","Crash Emmy- Winner, Paul Haggis, delivers another outstanding performance in "" Crash"" as he bestowed upon us before in ""Million Dollar Baby."" The movie ""Crash"" starts off ,in L.A., with a car accident and leaves the audience wondering what the cause of the accident was. Twenty-four hours earlier flashes across the screen and we are then introduced to five or six different groups of characters who are complete strangers to one another. The different groups of characters consist of Latinos, African- Americans, Whites, Asians, and Persians whose lives all intervene in unpredictable ways. The audience doesn't know how the characters relate to each other until it is revealed in the end. If you enjoy movies that leave you guessing until the ending, I would recommend this film to you. I found this movie to be brilliant and became a huge Paul Haggis fan after watching it.<br/><br/>There are a number of different plots and sequences, but they all link together in surprising and unique ways. The movie goes back and fourth between the character's cultures and fears that comes with living in L.A. The audience is shown a number of story lines such as: A car accident, a car jacking, vandalism in a marketplace, a suspicious death, and LAPD being untrustworthy. All the stories circle around one thing, RACISM! All the characters deal with the consequences they a dealt and we learn that there is good and bad in everyone.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is an extremely powerful film and delivers a strong message. Paul Haggis speaks out about how racism still exists in our society no matter how much we deny being racist or prejudiced. He shows us how we place judgment on strangers by their cultural backgrounds. Haggis says things throughout the film which makes the audience feel uncomfortable. It is shocking to hear a character say, ""Why do these guys have to be black?"" This movie is disturbing, but reality.<br/><br/>""Crash"" features a Hollywood cast playing unusual roles. A huge reason of why this is an excellent movie is because of this amazing cast. It includes: Matt Dillon as a racist police officer, Ryan Phillippe as his nervous partner, Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard as an African- American couple, Larenz Tate and ""Ludacris"" as African-American carjackers, Brendan Fraser as a White district attorney, Sandra Bullock as his White, racist, wife, Michael Pena as a polite and caring locksmith, and Don Cheadle as a African-American detective. All of the cast deliver magical performances in the roles they play which makes the movie that much more interesting and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a film that speaks out about a subject very offensive and which stirs up a lot of controversy in our society today. This movie leads to discussion after seeing it and makes you wonder when we are going to put racism behind us? Or will we ever? This film is made for mature audiences with an R rating for language, sexual content, and some violence. It keeps the audience guessing and there is never a dull moment. I would suggest you go see this brilliant film, if you haven't already, because it is a subject that needs to be thought about and shouldn't be ignored any longer."

So everything can be changeable.<br/><br/>In real life you need dealing with all kinds of relationships. The key is leniency. If you own it, you can get good relationship with anyone else.

"anhedonia","8","3","9","21 May 2005"," A bit preachy, but still thought-provoking
","Twenty minutes into ""Crash,"" I realized none of the characters we'd been introduced to was all that likable. Not one person. They were all racist on some level - from the gun store owner who spews xenophobia in true post-9/11 fashion to the LAPD Detective Ria (Jennifer Esposito), who gets rear-ended at the start of the film by a Chinese driver; from LAPD Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), who has one of the film's most unsettlingly creepy moments during a bogus traffic stop, to the D.A.'s hysterical wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock), who clearly has race issues.<br/><br/>And I wondered what exactly writers Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco were trying to say. <br/><br/>By the end of the film, their message is clear. This is a movie about the ridiculousness and stupidity of prejudice and intolerance. It doesn't matter whether you're white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Persian, Muslim, Christian or Jew. Prejudice is within all of us and, in this case, comes out in all its ugly glory. This is life in the 21st century melting pot, except our irrational fears and prejudices don't really allow for much melting.<br/><br/>But it's also more than that. ""Crash"" also is about getting beneath the surface. People are not what they seem. Just when we think we've encountered a slimy S.O.B., he turns around and does something good. And when we meet a wholesome, righteous person, he turns around and shocks us with abhorrent behavior.<br/><br/>Maverick American filmmaker Robert Altman clearly influences Haggis' storytelling style. Haggis weaves all his disparate tales together in Altmanesque fashion. This film borrows its style from ""Nashville"" (1975) and ""Short Cuts"" (1993), and even the other Altman-influenced movie, Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" (1999). <br/><br/>And Haggis does it smoothly. He picks up stories just when they're fading from memory. He ties it all together very well. And, you could argue, a bit too well. Because some of the transitions from one character's tale to another depends a lot on coincidence. In this case, sometimes it's a bit too coincidental that one character would run into another. But it's a conceit I'm willing to buy. Because despite this movie-flaw, ""Crash"" still pulls us in quite remarkably.<br/><br/>There's nothing needless or wasted in this film. True, you're being pulled in by coincidences, but that's also the film's charm. The stories occasionally get overwrought, but Haggis also pulls a few surprises, a few moments that completely jolt the audience.<br/><br/>What surprised me were some of the performances. Yes, we know we're going to get a great one from Don Cheadle. The man never disappoints. Here, he again proves why he's one of the best. Dillon plays a despicable cop to perfection - his initial scene with Thandie Newton will make your skin crawl - but he doesn't turn Officer Ryan into a one-dimensional monster. It would have been easy to do so, but Dillon's adds great depth to his persona and, to his credit, makes us care about this person. Surprisingly, Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges turn in performances that I honestly never thought they had in them. After ""Crash,"" why on earth would Bullock ever return to making crappy romantic comedies?<br/><br/>Haggis and Moresco also deal with our nation's post-9/11 intolerance of anyone who even resembles an Arab and our collective ignorance about other cultures. In one telling moment, an Iranian woman washes away racist graffiti and wonders, ""When did Persians become Arab?"" I don't think the film's anti-gun message is coincidental, either. Haggis makes it clear that our easy access to handguns clearly ignites or exacerbates tense situations. <br/><br/>The film's virtues outweigh its less-than-stellar moments. Despite its flaws, including being less than subtle about being preachy and one too many contrived coincidences, this film makes you think. How many modern American movies can you say that about?"
"texasfilmcowboy","5","3","9","7 May 2005"," well made but missed the mark
","I'm all for a movie that deals with racial issues, but Crash is not the movie to see for this reason. All the racial tensions in this movie are very shallow issues that don't seem to work in today's modern world. The character's stories do tie in together well and they did an okay attempt at dissecting stereotypes but in the end I don't feel like the characters made a complete change in their way of thinking and racial stereotypes were reinforced. I just don't think they went as far as they could have or needed to go with the story and characters. The ending was happy despite tragedy which seems to irk me for some reason. It was hopeful, however, but I don't think their mindsets changed too much so what was there to be hopeful about? As well as the photography and mise en scene of the film, I have to say it was excellent. There were some amazing shots in this film. Lighting seemed natural and flowed well from scene to scene. To me, it was very grainy which I enjoyed. I'm not sure if this was intentional or if thats just how I saw it. If you are an inspiring director of photography or editor, this is a film to study for these reasons. So overall, didn't like the flow of the story but I enjoyed the look of the film."
"tcarnam","7","3","9","6 May 2005"," A pretty blunt and (overly) earnest movie with fine acting
","The movie is basically a 6, maybe even a 5, but the acting really helps. Don Cheadle does a striking job, but of course we don't expect much less from him at this point. Also measuring up to expectations were Matt Dillon, Keith David and Tony Danza, though his part was small. Surprisingly good were Michael Pena, Ryan Philippe, and Ludicrous, who, looking back on all of this, might even be the sleeper of the cast.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, outside of the acting this was just an obvious, unimaginative, clunky movie. It's late, I don't really feel like getting into it, so I'll let it suffice to say that if you're the kind of person who likes ambiguous fiction, if you prefer art that asks you questions, leaves you with frayed and stringy ends for you to decide what to do with, then this movie is not for you. It gives you all the answers loud and clear, sometimes in the form of a cell phone ringer and the text that accompanies it.<br/><br/>But like I said, the acting is pretty great at times. Certainly it's worth a video rental just to see Cheadle, and if you combine Ludicrous and Matt Dillon, you might even find it worthwhile to see a matinÃ©e."

","This film is extremely underrated. And to have won best picture and be underrated is a hard feat to accomplish. The overall cinematography is very good, and the way it brings emotion out of anyone should be something that people marvel at. This is the type of powerful movie that everyone should be forced to watch at some point in their life. The Screen play is excellent as Paul Haggis does a great job of tying all these people's lives together. Somehow, the script was able to grab incredible performances from every character, even the amateurs like rapper Ludicrous. It is pure power the way it sends your emotions on a frenzy, from being stunned by the racial tension, to the couple humorous scenes. Matt Dillon's performance is solid, and Terrance Howard and Don Cheadle give their usual excellent performance. I've used a certain word multiple times in this comment, and that is the only word to describe this film: Excellence."

No. This film shows the indecency of the shallow minded majority of the characters and their very un-patriotic racist views.<br/><br/>This certainly is a deep and heavy-going film, but this film needs to feature those aspects because it is not a light issue that the director is trying to put across.<br/><br/>If you that life is so happy and sweet in the US watch this film and the message it puts across is what people have to deal with simply because of their looks, background or religion.<br/><br/>This film is a must see.

"CubsandCulture","5","2","5","31 August 2018"," Half-Baked, Weirdly Dated and Morally Suspect
","This is one of the least deserving Best Picture of all time. It is not a good movie. And more to the point, the films it won over were all so much better. I think a lot of people will complain about the script. There is a ton of unsubtle sociological points made and there is a ton of a coincidences. However, that largely doesn't bother me. The script, if viewed as a morality parable, is really good. Most of the character are archetypes and go through really straight forward arcs. (They are all a variant on redemption and punitive). Most characters have at least have some irony to their character. And in any case the sublime acting soothes over the rough edges. However, the direction is simply at odds with this sort of theatrical abstraction.<br/><br/>Haggis, the director, routinely fails Haggis, the screenwriter by presenting the events in a naturalistic and subdued visual style. This script was calling for far less visual restraint and it should been pushed far, far, farther into neo-noir lighting. The script is operatic and the direction is conventional and that just doesn't have a tonal consistency to it. And unfortunately there's just enough visual flourishes to sense that Haggis realized this. I.E. the repeated Christmas imagery.<br/><br/>Apart from that there is one problem with the script that does bug me. The movie is about racism and bigotry. It spends most, but not all, of its time demonstrating overt bigotry and the consequence of overt stereotypical thinking. Racism generally doesn't work that way today anymore. Implicit bias and convert racism is far, far, far more common and the film does not seem to realize that. This makes the film feel like it arrived late. The treatment here of racism is far more needed in the 60's, not the 2000's. (This aspect use to feel worse but unfortunately Trumpianism happened).<br/><br/>And in the same vein I have a huge problem with Dillion's character being treated as ""redeemed."" There simply isn't enough done by the character to warrant thinking he made up for sexually assaulting Newton's character. It is also an example of sexism being propped up to discuss racism. This aspect really is suspect. <br/><br/>Crash was a terrible, terrible choice for best picture."

","Crash ranks near or at the top of overrated movie lists and worst movies to win Oscars. Sure Capote, Brokeback Mountain and others around the time were good candidates, but this beats those. I think that the main reason why people dislike this is because of the use of multiple story lines. Some may be better than others, but all are fantastic. All connect in powerful ways with powerful endings. Each story's build-up and development makes the whole movie exciting. And the emotional-charging premises have huge impacts on the viewer that will leave the the viewer speechless and teary-eyed. <br/><br/>This movie does not have exceptional timing techniques or anything like that.

","Created in 2004, Crash was written and directed by Paul Haggis. Crash starts out with a simple wreck and ends up in bloodshed. All of this is due to prejudice, and stereotypes. The movie follows seven interlaced stories. Crash showed how prejudice and stereotypes affects people, and how these misconceptions are started. Throughout the movie, the characters crash into each other, some metaphorically, and others literally. The movie starts with Jennifer Esposito, who plays Ria, getting crashed into by an Asian lady. There happens to be a crime scene near which then sparks a flashback to the day before. Sandra Bullock plays the scared spoiled wife of a politician, Jean. Jean and her husband Rick where was held at gunpoint and carjacked by two African American men, Anthony, and Peter. Anthony and Peter run over an Asian man getting out of his white van while joyriding Jean and Rick's black SUV. One of the carjackers, Peter, was the brother of a detective named Graham, who was played by Don Cheadle. Jean had her locks changed after having her car stolen, and did not like how the locksmith named Daniel looked. When Daniel, who is played by Michael Pena, tries unsuccessfully to fix a lock on a broken door for a shop owner, the shop owner gets angry. Farhad, the shop owner, decides to take matters into his own hands to make Daniel responsible for his shop getting broke into and robbed. He ends up shooting at Daniel's kid, but did not kill her, because his daughter Dorri, who is played by Bahar Soomekh, loaded the gun with blanks. Anthony later went back and stole the Asian's white van, and found out there was a bunch of people being smuggled in the back of the van. He ended up doing the right thing and letting them go. Noticing the same kind of car that was stolen from Rick and Jean, the cops pull over a director and his wife. Ryan, a racist cop, and his rookie partner Hansen pull them over. Ryan molests the wife while the husband cannot do anything. Hansen picked up Peter when he hitchhiked and he ended up shooting Peter when he thought Peter was pulling out a gun. The story laces in many characters to the story line. The only other movie I can think of that jumped around this successfully was Premonition. In 2007, Sandra Bullock also plays in Premonition. Like Premonition, Crash jumps around, but it does so with a purpose. <br/><br/>One of the techniques that were very well carried out in this film was the transitions. The film had seamless transitions between scenes. Since the movie had so many stories going at once, good transitions were very important when switching between stories.<br/><br/>Another technique that was well implemented was lighting. Even though some scenes were dark, you could still see the characters perfectly. The light hit even the rain drops and accented them perfectly. <br/><br/>Crash was a very moving movie that really makes one think about there own prejudices. It has a very large and great cast. It is a very well written and edited movie. Crash is a very moving and insightful movie. <br/><br/>References Haggis, P. (2004). Crash Motion picture. United States: Lions Gate Films."

","Crash Directed and written by by Paul Haggis (Million dollar baby)screenplay writer Released in May of 2005 Starring Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle and Thandie Newton.<br/><br/>There are many films that leave the viewer ""awe-inspired"", humbled and speechless and Crash is one of them. Directed and written by Paul Haggis, this heart-wrenching drama was released in May of 2005, starring many familiar faces; from America's sweetheart Sandra Bullock to the all-serious Don Cheadle, along with the modern faces of Ryan Philippe and Matt Dillon, there is a wide variety of talent exposed in this irresistible film.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock, as Jean Cabot, shows us an emotional journey to find love, peace and comfort within herself as an ordinary housewife. Don Cheadle reveals his talent in the role as detective Graham Waters residing in LA. Next, Matt Dillon as an over-zealous cop-officer Ryan-is easily angered throughout the film and releases his aggressions through racial profiling while at work. Ryan Phillippe is Officer Ryan's rookie sidekick that disapproves of Officer Ryan's approach, however, is obligated to support him. Throughout the film, the various groups of individuals are so caught up in ""living at the speed of life, they are all bound to collide with each other"" (lions Gate, 2005). The truth in this statement is painful. <br/><br/>This film depicts the lives of a group of different individuals, living in LA that are bound to collide. The film follows the lives of these various groups of individuals, all merely existing in their different lives, when in a single night they all become connected in a major car crash. As we follow the lives of all of these individuals, many suggested and implied themes are revealed: racism followed by the needs of human nature and never-ending hope. Jean longs for peace, to let go of her personally misunderstood anger as a housewife while Officer Ryan relentlessly cares for his sick father and Detective Waters lives jadedly. As the intensity of every-day speed of life builds, the yearning of all the individuals in this film is related by human nature. The yearning for fulfillment, love, acceptance and hope.<br/><br/>Academy award winner and screenplay writer of ""Million Dollar Baby"", Paul Haggis has developed the film Crash in a direct way that allows the characters in this film to be understood directly with bold intensity throughout the drama. The lighting and sound effects are incredibly dramatic and effortlessly draw you into the reality of the film. The actors' talent demonstrates raw emotions on a scale that every viewer can identify with-human nature. <br/><br/>Any and every viewer of this film can identify themselves on different levels with the themes of throughout film. The theme of human nature in this film relates to that in the film ""American Beauty"" when Lester gives in to his needs derived from simple human nature. Viewers can identify with the numerous elements of human nature, relentless hope and everlasting humbling from this film. The longing for love, touch, fulfillment hope-(whether good or evil)-lies within us all. The intensity throughout this drama packed film reveals the commonalities of all human nature."

","I want to start by saying that this was never on my list of films I needed to see before I die, and yet in hindsight I feel that it should have been. It has a great deal to say about modern racism in a number of forms. The writing is excellent, I really do feel that its Oscars were well deserved. The film puts across a number of really interesting points which you begin to realise- with horror- that most, if not all of them are very much real. I loved Don Cheadle, as always, as well as Brendan Fraser, but I must say that the show is stolen by Matt Dillon, who's heartbreakingly tragic character is the portrait of the modern-day working class white urban American white man. At times I felt I knew where the film was going, but it twists completely around to shock yet again. And the mixture of sad and happy endings will satisfy and shock."

","The film ""Crash"" was a film that I did not expect. I really learned a lot from this film. I learned that even if you do not know someone that someday you will definitely run into them or within this movie ""Crash"" into them. This film was definitely one that was different in the context that you would not think that it would have made it to the big times but it really did. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The main plot of this film is about how we crash into each other at some point in our life. We don't see it but at some point we run into someone that we never thought that we would. Our lives are interconnected in some way and we may never know until something happens that brings us together. Like when Matt Dillon (Officer Ryan) pulls over Terrence Howard (Cameron) and Thandie Newton (Christine) and then later on Officer Ryan ends up being one of the people that saves Christine. Then when Marina Sirtis (Shereen) is the coroner and meets Don Cheadle (Graham Walters) and his mother Beverly Todd. They meet in mysteries ways and when you get to the end of the movie you can really see where they meet and how great that the movie really is.<br/><br/>There is one other plot that I really saw in this film. I saw that in this film that things that one person does can come back and will affect someone else that is around them but not directly involved in the situation. I was really amazed by this film and I believe that it really is a great film."

This movie had various plots all going on at one time, which really made the film unique. I enjoy watching movies that allow me to feel emotion, it was able to bring out more than one emotion, which I personally feel is why this movie was so popular when it first came out in theaters.

","In my point of view this movie is one of the best movies of the 2000's.<br/><br/>The biggest issues presented in this movie are racism and the misunderstandings that can lead from the smallest to the biggest problems.In this thought can be included the chain reaction of scenes what start's when the store owner does not understand than in order to be fixed the store's lock ,first it has to be repaired the door.But despite this he is accusing the repairer that he is cheating and it will not be paid.This lead's to a war between them with a miraculous end what is explained later with a simple fact. Another memorable piece from the movie is when officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) shot's Peter (Lorenz Tate) thinking that the passenger will point a gun to him.Later too destroy the evidence Tom burn's his car what later it will be a worming object to some kids and too Cameron (Terrence Howard) who at last find's peace in his soul.<br/><br/>An other great theme of the movie is the human personality sometimes ugly, sometimes beautiful.This is perfectly exampled when in a moment officer John Ryan (Matt Dillon) is molesting a woman in the front of his husband and in another he saves her from a mortal crash.(From this scene is the movie's title inspired) <br/><br/>Mark Isham's soundtrack is greatly matching with the movie and Bird York's single ""In The Deep"" in the scene when everyone find's peace inside is the picture's highpoint.<br/><br/>Best movie made by Paul Haggis"

It seems as if we are behind glass, the glass of race, and we are looking into reality. This action of standing behind glass leads us to ""crash"" into one another, creating something that we never before.

I would make this movie a mandatory school viewing...think for a second about the impact it would have...no teacher, monk, or guru needed. I do humbly share with Haggis the detachment of being born abroad and moved to the States in my early 20s and not having had my nose glued against the window of America, and that is the beauty of having ""outsiders"" bringing a mirror and telling you: ""well, this is how you look"" and still remaining compassionate and most of all entertaining when dealing with matters that could bore you to death. I think the new American movie makers have now gotten the message of having the guts and the need to touch the public where it hurts without actually making him feel any pain but simply more aware."
"vostf","5","2","5","12 January 2009"," Multi-pronged story with a bit of gusto but little achievement
","Mixing several story lines has become a fixture for independent film-making after Pulp Fiction made it cool. Then independent came to mean nothing more than a genre more prone to grab Oscar noms than the immediate buck at the Box-office.<br/><br/>Most of the time these movies have one very good story and the rest is a bit weak. Soderbergh's Traffic perfectly exemplified this in 2000, and now Crash has come to grab the supreme Academy Award with very little originality and substance indeed. It's not a bad movie but it lacks the feel of a movie that gets into you, only pulling the easy strings, pinching the usual emotional wire in a very professional way. So where is there emotion in Crash? It is hidden here and there with the fine actors yet on the whole it's too scarce to give you the impression it's great. It's nicely put together but it never takes you away.<br/><br/>One scene speaks millions: the one with the little girl running to her father outside the house with the Persian shop owner nearby. Well done. It does work, but inside the whole movie it eventually proves to be only a nicely polished piece with little relevance.<br/><br/>Compare this to Amores Perros. The middle story is weaker but everything is more consistent, everything flows from the camera, it's not only about taking us for an emotional trip around LA, it's truly about characters getting us into a story, their story. Hence the emotion."

","Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" has become a film that people love to hate. All over the message boards on this site, people are expressing their outrage regarding ""Crash's"" Best Picture victory. Look, I understand that the movie is a little over-the-top at times, and goes a little too far to make its point, but I still believe it was worthy of the Oscar.<br/><br/>I'll tell you why. In particular three scenes jump out at me as three of the best I've ever seen. The two standouts -- the scene in which Matt Dillon saves Thandie Newton, and the scene in which we are led to believe that Michael Pena's adorable daughter has been shot -- are masterful. So well-timed, well-shot, executed, and emotional. Just breathtaking.<br/><br/>The third, the sleeper of the trio, is our introduction to Pena's daughter and their relationship. When he comes home after a frustrating encounter with Sandra Bullock's shaken character, we see his origin, what's going on behind that first scene. Pena is no ""gangbanger,"" as Bullock puts it. He's an excellent, caring, sensitive father with a daughter who is nothing short of an angel.<br/><br/>It's fitting that the Persian storekeeper refers to her as ""his angel,"" toward the end of the film. Pena's interaction with her involving the ""Invisible Cloak,"" is captivating. We are amazed at what a good father he is, and how sweet his only child is. Very touching.<br/><br/>I agree with those who were unimpressed by Brendan Fraser's performance, and some who weren't particularly impressed by Bullock. I'll give you that; but Dillon, Newton, Pena, and Terrence Howard were outstanding. Ryan Philippe held up his end, as well.<br/><br/>Hey, we know that Haggis is trying to hit us hard with ""Crash."" But what's the big deal? Some people really are THAT racist. There's no doubt about it.<br/><br/>I say, let him hit us. Melodramatic at times, but still ultimately successful. A moving film."

I was expecting an emotional piece but not as in depth as this one. I mean yes it does seem very unlikely that all these people somehow meet, but you know what its still possible. I also like the fact that this was not done right after 9/11. I think people would be too distracted and the message that Haggis was trying to get across would not reach most audiences. The cast in this movie could not have been better. Most of the actors and actresses in it we have heard of but have not done anything real serious yet. Therefore we know their acting abilities and what they are capable of but we just haven't seen it yet. This movie brings out the best in each and every one of these actors. Basically in a nutshell, this movie is an extremely powerful piece and should be taken seriously."

","I had no idea what this movie was when I first rented it. I had never heard of it. I didn't know who was in it or even what it was about. I just knew that, when I worked at Blockbuster Video, everyone was asking for it when it came out. So, I decided to see what all the hype was about. After I had finished the movie, I was impressed. I thought it definitely lived up to all the talk I had heard. It had a terrific cast with a story that never slowed down. It provided a strong, emotional look at the racism running rampant. We are reminded of how everything we do affects the lives of those around us. One of the aspects I loved about this film was that it inspired thought after the credits began to roll.<br/><br/>This movie follows an ensemble cast and has multiple small story lines weaving through it. Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito play detectives investigating the murder of a black LAPD officer who was shot by a white colleague. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton play a couple whose lives are changed after they are pulled over by the police and things go wrong. Brendan Fraser is a DA who, with his wife (Sandra Bullock), is carjacked by Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges and Larenz Tate. This is only a sampling of the stories involved; each one colliding together in a 24 period.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis did a great job with his movie. Each of the case does a spectacular job. I enjoyed watching actors/actresses working roles I had never pictured them in, namely Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser. I wasn't used to seeing them in such serious roles and it was cool to witness the range of their abilities. Ludicrous really surprised me with how well he did in this movie. With so little acting experience, he really seemed to put 100% into his role and did well. There really weren't any weak spots in this film's casting and it would take forever to mention how well they each did.<br/><br/>There seem to be a lot of people who really don't like this movie, but I fail to see why. Each of the stories is developed enough to enjoy, despite having so many in one film. The acting is great and the flow of the story keeps from boring its audience. It's emotionally powerful (my wife STILL cries when watching it) and it sends an important message. As I said before, this movie also shows how much people effect each other in their daily lives. This is definitely a 'love it or hate it' movie and I think it's worth giving it a shot to find out where you stand."

It won the 2005 Oscar for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Crash is one of those films that tries to seriously tackle a big issue from all sides, through many different characters and multiple plot lines. One of the negative raps 'Crash' has received is that it relies on unlikely co-incidences in some plot developments. Some people don't agree with this, but I did get this feeling. Some of the meetings between the various characters are quite unlikely by themselves, and the whole thing isn't helped by introducing all the main characters at the start and then just having them interact only with each other through the whole long film without introducing anyone else noteworthy. In other words, it feels like Los Angeles is only populated by these people, making their surprise interactions even more jarring as the plot twists and turns ... and twists some more.<br/><br/>The film's tagline, said at one point by Matt Dillon's cop, is 'you think you know who you are? You have no idea.' And the film gets this point across at various instances by repeatedly scratching the surface of its characters. The victim becomes the bigot, the bigot discovers underlying humanity etc. Its a simple message, of course: scratch the surface (the colour of a person's skin) and you'll find depth.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining enough and the tone is pretty much what you would expect from the above description - empathetic, serious, dramatic conflict and self discovery. The acting is good with Don Cheadle displaying a Morgan Freeman ability to make us feel what is going on underneath his sombre, still exterior. Thandie Newton gets the biggest scenes and crackles with intensity. Overall its good - there's one scene (impenetrable cloak) in the middle that gave me goosebumps and is now one of my favourite movie moments - but occasionally kind of florid and a little bit amateurish. <br/><br/>Oh, and for the record, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a much better, focused film than this and should have won the Best Pic award."

","I can't believe Roger Ebert and the Academy rate this movie so highly--and IMDb users, for that matter. This movie about people succumbing to or overcoming racism strikes a chord a couple times, but only if the viewer is willing to suspend judgment for very long periods of contrived plot machinations that get you to these key points. (One could be much less charitable and say that simply the whole movie falls flat, for how on earth could one be moved by these key moments when they were so falsely set up?) It seemed to me that the entire film, though set up in the in-vogue style of the interweaving plot, was an endless string of caricatures, and downright impossible coincidences if you add them all up together.<br/><br/>Bottom line: how can you have a relevant social commentary, if the movie is constructed of unrealistic events and actions?? It all rings false for me. Still I give it a 5/10 for those key moments."
"mkerr81-1","4","2","5","4 March 2007"," Angry with Crash (spoiler)
","I am angry with Crash. It was my fault really...I made the crucial mistake of getting caught up in the hype. It had a very talented writer/director running things a great ensemble cast, how could you go wrong??? I'll tell you how...by listening to the hype. After finally seeing the movie with all those high expectations given the cast and all else I was let down. I hated and loathed the movie. I originally rated it with one star before changing it to four for the sake of the talented cast. One was a little unfair and was based more on my disappointment than on the actual movie itself. But the thing that bothers me about the movie is the fact that so many people find it so incredible yet it is an average movie at best. This is due to the way in which so many of the crazy racial situations in the movie just seem too forced and too orchestrated to make me care about most of these characters or even feel that they're real. I can not blame the actors, I felt the cast really did the best they could due and sadly the blame must lay on Haggis himself. <br/><br/>No.... <br/><br/>I am not a Haggis hater. I actually enjoy most of his other works, including his latest TV work the Black Donelly's...actually might be one of the best shows out right now. I just feel no real point was made with the movie. It feels as if his approach was to get a talented multi cultural cast, put them in over the top racially motivated situations and the rest of the movie would take care of itself. <br/><br/>Matt Dillion's character fondles, gropes and molests Thandie Newton's character simply to give the black couple a hard time because they're black. Okay that's fine, I mean it's not but it fits within the story. Now Dillion's character has reasons for being a racist asshole but so does every other racist asshole. My problem is in less than a week after this sexual abuse the officer Dillion plays, runs into Newton again on the scene of an accident and all of a sudden in an instant, seeing her there trapped in burning car wreckage all his hate melts, he is instantly sorry for his racially motivated abuse and his hate filled persona magically dissipates and he is transformed into a compassionate hero who must rescue this woman he has wronged! All this in the half a second it takes him to look in and see her trapped inside the car. How touching...now Newton's character goes from being victimized by this man to becoming indebted to him, owing him her life as he holds and consoles her!?? <br/><br/>Does anyone find this extremely too Hollywood and unrealistic? Too many of the social situations seem too contrived and it's as if Haggis put the actors in front of the camera and instructed them to act as pig headed and racist as possible and it's okay cause it's Hollywood and i'll make it look heartwarming buy adding a warm fuzzy soundtrack and throwing in an ironic plot twist to boot. Crash isn't the worst movie, just not a very good one. Not one deserving of an Oscar at least. After watching it twice just to make sure I find it average at best. <br/><br/>And no...it is not because I dislike artsy films, Une liaison pornographique happens to be very artsy and very good. One of my favorites. <br/><br/>I just think Haggis tries too hard to make a point which never surfaces. Real racism which i've experienced on a number of levels isn't always the in your face variety. Most of it is pretty damned subtle. I think in attempt to make his social commentary Haggis, loses sight of this and as a result goes over the top and loses the realism of the film. American History X is a similar type movie that does a much better job of handling these dynamics and is a much better movie for it. From talking to others, people either love or hate the movie. I think the people who hated the movie wouldn't hate it as much if the people who loved it would not herald it as the greatest, most compelling, social commentary since Sarafina. Crash caters more to the set of movie goers that want to prove to themselves and others they are hip and socially conscious. As if to say ""hey I hang with Blacks and Asians, plus I loved the movie Crash, so I can't be racist!"" Not to say people that enjoyed it are racist...maybe a little sheltered; or maybe they just haven't watched too many great movies in order to know this ain't one of them. All in all I would say it was a promising movie that fell apart on the strength of it's own ambition."

It was a very exciting moment when the little girl jumped into her daddy's arms just as the gun was fired. And evidently a policeman does not like to be laughed at. He can become very touchy indeed with dire consequences. Despite some good scenes the whole was disappointing.<br/><br/>We know there is racism in America.

","Last year, the New York Times Magazine featured an article on how good television has surpassed good film-making. The smart shows with converging plot lines that make demands on their audience for active viewing are largely absent from movies, which still emphasize a more passive entertainment.<br/><br/>Crash doesn't do that, and that's largely the reason for its glowing reception, in addition to its natural cachet for tackling a ""tough"" subject.<br/><br/>But the dialog for the film is clumsy and overdone, implying that racism abounds only in overt forms. Quiet racism is just as insidious and much more common: for every scene where Matt Dillon brandishes open racism with his personnel officer, there are thousands more where both parties know that racism is what is driving the conversation, yet neither comes out to say it.<br/><br/>As much as the film-making trusts its audience to put together pieces of different story lines, the dialog doesn't trust its audience at all. Not a single act of racism slides across the screen without a spotlight and flashing arrows.<br/><br/>Keep track of the stories, but don't worry about the point of any given scene: you can't miss it."

","I just watched Crash. Through most of the movie, I was able to forgive the contrivances that sometimes strain credibility, because the movie was delving into areas of complex race relations that often are neglected. Unfortunately, this movie takes a few huge wrong turns. First, its only Asian couple is negatively portrayed (and for the female half, stereotyped) beyond belief--the woman is a bad driver, she hysterically screams in barely intelligible English with L's replacing R's, and the man turns out to be involved in smuggling illegal Asian workers into the country and is more interested in cashing his payment for his smuggling than in his own well-being. Second, the Middle Eastern father is not much more than a shrill, xenophobic, proud, and ultimately violent man. And finally, the seemingly enlightened cop (Ryan Philippe) suddenly and inexplicably turns into his bigoted ex-partner in the middle of a conversation in a car, after risking his life earlier in the film to right a wrong committed by his ex-partner against an African-American couple whom he did not know.<br/><br/>You may say in the movie's defense that it does not have several hours to fully explore race relations among so many different ethnic groups. I agree that you have to give up some breadth in exchange for depth, but I will point out that the movie does not have to include negative portrayals and stereotypes for various ethnic groups if it does not have the time to examine those portrayals and stereotypes in depth. These mistakes (I hope they were mistakes) end up leaving a bigoted taint on this movie, which is all the more ironic and tragic considering that this movie seems to be trying to confront racial discrimination and open a constructive discourse on the utter stupidity and destructiveness of racial discrimination. What a shame!"

I did think it was trying to do something different and important, and after seeing what movies have come to these days, I felt it deserved credit for that. But I could not get on the Crash bandwagon with no reservations. I felt it was a flawed film.<br/><br/>I was watching--had almost gone to bed--when they announced it As Best Picture, beating out the favorite, Brokeback Mountain. It was worth staying up to see the reactions which were heartwarming for the people who won. Having also seen Brokeback, which I thought was terrible overrated, I would have also voted for CRash as Best Picture. At least Crash was making an effort to treat a topic that is timely and important. I felt Brokeback didn't do nearly such a good job.<br/><br/>So anyway, there are lots of Best Pictures that weren't true masterpieces. At least this one tried and made a great effort. Give it that."

","I was as amazed as anyone that Crash beat Brokeback Mountain to the Oscar. I cannot believe that people were uppity about the so called 'gayness' of Brokeback when Crash showed up the mindless racism of LA - and they seemed to want to celebrate the fact. To me that's plain madness.<br/><br/>Crash is a good film in my opinion. The strong points: it's worthy, the story highlights issues and prejudices that shouldn't exist, and it shows some positive resolutions to those problems in a way that seems creditable. Also the acting is top class and the technical work + music (by Mark Isham) is very good.<br/><br/>But... the dialogue just feels so contrived and so unnatural. I didn't believe that these characters would talk like they did. It seemed to me that the writers tried to write passionate and thought provoking verbal arguments between characters, whilst making no effort to make them subtle. The archetypal poor, black man spoke exactly the same way as the archetypal rich, white man. The only thing that prevented the film from sliding into a bad one was the fact that there were many story lines that drew our attention away from the dodgy dialogue from the previous scene.<br/><br/>At the end of watching it I was left thinking, ""noble effort, but not sensational."" It will forever be infamous for 'that Oscar win' which will bring undue hostility toward a film that wasn't designed for it. Brokeback Mountain was the better all-round film, but Crash deserves some credit for being as brave in it's subject matter - even though it doesn't live up to the same overall standard."

Racism and xenophobia, the unattractive side of our humanity, isn't the most popular subject, but everyone of us has to deal with it at one point. Being an immigrant myself, albeit with WASP-Canadian ancestry, I must admit in the past I had stood on both sides of the fence when it comes to alienation. Back in my home country Canada, I was openly against the borderless immigration-refugee act that liberals promoted. Toronto, the largest city in Ontario, is a city where minority IS the MAJORITY. The dynamics among ethnic groups are quite different here down in the states...racism takes different forms, a more internalized one where violence and conflicts often erupts between the minority group themselves. What's my point? Open immigration is NOT the conduit that leads to tolerance levels. In the case of Toronto, it excerbates the race relations. I hope the newly elected Conservatives would do something about it."
"ElenaP-3","5","2","5","6 February 2006"," Good, But not as Great as I was Told
","I watched this film with the expectation of something more than what I got from it. I might have known better a long time ago when school friends told me to go see junk like ""Love Story""; that I'd cry my eyes out. Instead, I watched laughable dialogue and cliché nonsense, and frankly, couldn't wait for the abysmal and snotty Ali MacGraw character to die. ""Crash"" tries to work on many levels. There are some absolutely powerful performances from talents like Terrence Howard (the TV Producer), whose Black manhood is brought to Level Orange by the attempted hijacking of his SUV by Ludicrous and his accomplice; Thandie Newton is searing as his wife, who questions said manhood after they are stopped by the racist cop, Matt Dillon, as he blatantly molests her, while her husband stands by and does nothing; Michael Pena as the Mexican locksmith, a decent and loving family man; Don Cheadle as the cop, whose younger brother is out there somewhere, running with a bad crowd; Matt Dillon, as a deeply embittered racist cop, alienated from most of his peers, and caring for a sick parent; Ryan Philippe, as his squad partner, trying to ease the racial tensions, but ultimately, worse than Dillon in the long run. There are some intensely memorable scenes: The irony of Matt Dillon's character attempting to rescue Thandie Newton after her car crash. Her initial rejection of him, and the ensuing panic mirror the impending flames, and the danger to both of them.<br/><br/>The fuming anger of Terrence Howard brought to boiling point as he wrestles the gun away from Ludicrous, and pistol whips him with it, almost getting into a fatal confrontation with the police himself.<br/><br/>The desperation of Michael Pena as he confronts the angry Iranian shopkeeper waving a gun at him, and nearly loses his adorable little girl in the process.<br/><br/>As far as other performances, Jennifer Esposito is less than memorable as Cheadle's Latin girlfriend, and Sandra Bullock's performance is only strong because it's a ""serious"" role for her - as opposed to all the comic lightweight fluff she's done, even in ""action"" movies. She gets to be the angry, rich, bored wife of DA Brendan Fraser, and her racism peaks after their car is initially stolen by Ludicrous. Her final, telling embrace of her Mexican housekeeper, whom she's usually ordering about and verbally abusing, as her ""only friend"", is lifted right out of ""Driving Miss Daisy"", when Daisy (Jessica Tandy) makes the same realization about her driver/companion Hoke (Morgan Freeman). Brendan Fraser is just about passable, and some of the other performances just pass muster, but make no indelible impression.<br/><br/>There were some holes that I found in the story. Why is it that when both the DA's vehicle, and Terrence Howard's vehicles were hijacked - absolutely NO ONE was around to see what was happening? After all, Howard's vehicle was hijacked in broad daylight. In a far-fetched turn, when the Iranian shopkeeper managed to find out somehow where Michael Pena lived, and also tracked him down, ready for vengeance because he blamed Pena for the destruction of his store, he also shot at him (and his child) in broad daylight, on a residential street; you mean to tell me that NONE of the neighbors could see or hear this confrontation going on, and call the cops? And why didn't Pena's character call the cops afterward to report this lunatic? After all, he wanted to kill him! Why does Ryan Philippe play ""avenging angel"" with Terrence Howard, saving him from trigger-happy police, yet, freaks out when he picks up Ludicrous' friend, and shoots him in yet another clichéd unprovoked situation? Why did that Korean woman say ""blake"", instead of ""brake"" - another hackneyed cliché right out of WWII propaganda movies (just substitute an ""evil"" Japanese character)at the sight of the accident with Jennifer Esposito? How did her husband manage to survive being hit by Ludicrous' car, after the two men dragged him out from under it and dumped him out so roughly onto the pavement, he could have bled to death from internal injuries alone? ""Crash"" makes some important points about racism, but some of the characters boil down to stereotypes, and we are constantly bombarded with this throughout the film. Yes, it's bad, yes, it exists, yes, there's good and bad in all ethnic stratas, but at times it reads like caricature, and somewhat amateurish - which is not to say there are aren't some rather astute observations mixed in, but they seem to get lost in the mix. While I watched this, I thought of an earlier film that sort of paralleled this - Lawrence Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon"", filmed back in the '90's, examined racial relations in L.A. in a completely different way. I would suggest renting it, and comparing the two. Although times have changed some, basic human nature and attitudes have not."

","""Crash"" has so many good things going for it, it's a shame that it's hampered by a clunky, obvious and over-earnest script. The movie is very Altmanesque in design, featuring a large ensemble cast and a plot that intricately weaves various plot lines together in surprising ways. Unlike Altman's best films, though, ""Crash"" doesn't have that spontaneous, improvised feel; everything feels too forced and overly scripted. Every scene plays out in the same way, creating an ever so slightly monotonous pace. It's a movie with great intentions that isn't entirely successful at fulfilling them.<br/><br/>But, the writing is my only complaint. From a directing and acting standpoint, ""Crash"" triumphs. Paul Haggis makes the leap from screenwriter to director ably, and does a wonderful job of keeping his story moving fluidly along, no matter how implausible it might be. And as far as the ensemble goes, this is ones of those movies (also very like an Altman film, come to think of it) that has a cast full of actors who you've never seen act as well as they do here. I wouldn't say I've ever been much impressed by the dramatic range of Ryan Philippe, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser or Sandra Bullock, but they certainly impress here. Bullock, despite a tiny role, makes an enormous impression, and her brief monologue during which she describes what it's like to wake up every morning filled with anger without even knowing what she's angry about, was one of the most affecting scenes I've seen in a movie all year.<br/><br/>Other cast members are excellent as well: Terrence Howard as a movie executive ""selling out"" to white America; Thandie Newton as his frustrated wife, angry at him for not standing up to the very people who have made her privileged life possible; Don Cheadle as a hardened detective who has resigned himself to the unfairness of being judged by the color of your skin.<br/><br/>Whatever its faults, ""Crash"" deserves high praise for tackling with intelligence and conviction subject matter that other film makers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. How refreshing in our time of political correctness that a film would dare suggest that stereotypes might be based on truths, and that a white director and writer can make a sharp film about the race question without feeling the need to cushion everything through the gauzy haze of liberal white guilt.<br/><br/>Not a perfect movie by any means, but one that I think deserves to be seen."

The writing was simple and the message was obvious to say the least. It's anti-racism context is as after school special as it gets! If you want to see a film that ties a series of events with one incident, watch Magnolia. One word that comes to mind when describing this movie - Overrated. I wish I waited for the DVD rental."

","Luckily, Crash doesn't suffer the same overwrought, juvenile story telling of the more acclaimed Million Dollar Baby. At least in this case Haggis is able to weave several interesting characters into a somewhat digestible film. However the so-called great exploration into race relations is totally underwhelming, ever so for anyone that's ever dealt with racism in real life.<br/><br/>The most interesting stories have to do with Det. Waters (Cheadle) and the other with Jack Ryan (Dillon). Waters is a respected African-American detective who lives in shame because of his addict mother, inability to have a healthy interracial relationship, and has to come to terms with his younger brother's actions and is forced to ""sell out"" within the force.<br/><br/>Dillon, in an amazing performance, is a racist cop, made so, not born with it. His father, hard-working, is forced into poverty and lives in pain and Dillon blames it on blacks. During a routine stop, he molests a young women in front of her husband. Their subsequent meeting, and the interaction between the characters during a life-threatening moment, is gripping. Ever more so, you never know if either character actually changed or whether these moments simply reinforced the realities of racism.<br/><br/>Good entertainment but without significant substance."

"EUyeshima","6","2","5","12 December 2005"," Truthful Anger Expressed Through Stellar Acting But Thwarted by Contrivance
","This omnibus fable is as provocative as its daring concept - thirty-six successive hours of hostile, racially charged activity intertwining diverse characters in contemporary Los Angeles - and contains some powerful acting. But at the end of it all, I was left rather hollow by the experience. Steeped in allegory with scenes that start with a key assumption (either on the character's part or ours) and end with some unexpected redemption, the novelty of first-time director Paul Haggis' 2005 film is initially powerful but gets wearing over its running time.<br/><br/>Haggis ambitiously presents a multi-ethnic city full of unremorseful anger - where the inhabitants without exception eye each other with suspicion and ignorance to the point where the familiar epithets fly. Much of the early dialogue is uncomfortable to hear at first, but Haggis and co-screenwriter Bobby Moresco derive the shock value from the innate familiarity one has with the pent-up feelings expressed in such an unfettered and sometimes blackly humorous manner. The intense honesty of the dialogue is the film's chief virtue, as it is rare for Hollywood to acknowledge any race problem in its backyard. More often, filmmakers pontificate about it from an antiseptic soapbox (consider ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" as a prime example).<br/><br/>A labyrinth plot has been constructed entirely out of the fabric of humanity torn mercilessly by racism, and the travails of over a dozen interconnecting characters make for quite a chess game. An ambitious young and white DA and his ice-cold wife are the victims of a carjacking at gunpoint that leads the wife into a state of hostile paranoia. She has the locks changed at their house by a Latino whom she myopically suspects is a gang member. In truth, the locksmith is a devoted family man who must face daily prejudices in his customer-oriented job. The carjackers are two young, seemingly educated black men who commit the crime out of an uncontrollable rage.<br/><br/>A black TV director faces the humiliation of seeing his wife groped by a racist white cop, while his young, naïve partner watches with equal helplessness. A Persian store owner, constantly labeled an Arab, has his daughter help him buy a gun for protection. A black detective, saddled with his drug-addicted mother and criminal brother, is partnered professionally and personally with a Latina, as they to solve the mystery of a dead body in the road. They all collide in ways that are alternately compelling and manipulative.<br/><br/>Most of the acting is stellar, but accommodating the complex plot with an expansive cast does not allow much screen time on an individual basis. Cast against type are two actors more famous for their light comedy roles - Brendan Fraser and an especially unsympathetic Sandra Bullock as the DA and his wife. With this brief role, actually with one confrontation scene, Bullock may just have overcome the hurdle that constantly befalls Meg Ryan - her perky likability has convincingly been subverted by a sharper, nastier edge of anger. I hope she does more such adventurous work in the future. Michael Peña plays the locksmith with dignity and provides one of the film's most primal moments when an angry customer blindly seeks restitution from him. Larenz Tate and a particularly impressive Ludicrous play the carjackers with intelligence and fury.<br/><br/>Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton sharply delineate a marriage where they straddle precariously between their black identities and the white power base that keeps them living in style. Matt Dillon does some of his best work in the challenging role of the racist cop, while a surprisingly effective Ryan Phillippe embodies the moral ambiguity of Dillon's partner with élan. As the detective, Don Cheadle - who also served as producer - provides the authority to bring it all together. Even an out-of-character Tony Danza shows up in a cameo as a racist actor complaining that another actor is not sounding ""black"" enough.<br/><br/>But there is an evolving contrivance to the story, especially toward the end when plot threads are sewn up in an almost too circular fashion. For example, there is no denying the power of scenes such as the second encounter between Dillon's and Newton's characters or the revelation of the dead body's identity, but there is also a sense of parable that undercuts the credibility of the situations. The fates of key characters seem to follow a similarly moralizing pattern as previously deplorable bigots show their courage and compassion under emotional duress or dyed-in-the-wool liberals tap almost too easily into their inner misogynist. Everything just seems too neatly thought out to make the movie truly transcendent.<br/><br/>The DVD is surprisingly skimpy on extras - a throwaway introduction by Haggis, a by-the-numbers making-of featurette that focuses more on how the actors desperately wanted to be part of the film, a music video and several trailers that I fast-forwarded through. Haggis, Moresco and Cheadle provide concise though informative commentary on an alternate audio track."

","I rented Crash last week because my girlfriend had to watch it for a project, but I had really been wanting to see it anyway with all the great things that I had heard about it.<br/><br/>Crash is a film that is wonderfully shot, directed, acted, produced, etc. The problem that comes with Crash is Paul Haggis's idea of stringing all the characters in the movie together. This is very effective at times, and really gets to Don Cheadles line at the beginning (which I will paraphrase poorly because I don't remember it clearly) when he says ""maybe why we crash is to connect."" But also it feels like sometimes that he was just trying to think about ways he could connect the stories to each other.<br/><br/>Haggis wrote a compelling and moving story about racial relations to an extent, but this is also taken too far sometimes. Literally every character in this movie, with the exception of Ryan Phillipe, is a racist or at the very least says a derogatory comment about another race. There are some truly powerful points in the film in which racism in LA is shown at it's grittiest, which are the best parts of the movie. But the fact that almost every single character in the movie says something racist felt very unrealistic to me and like Haggis was trying to over accomplish his goal.<br/><br/>A quick side note, music is used very very well throughout the film. Not just the song chosen, but also the score. It seemed to be more of a thriller score at that kept me and girlfriend both on our toes throughout the whole movie, just waiting for something terrible to happen.<br/><br/>In the end, Crash is all about how we change each others lives. In that regard it succeeds. But for the reasons above, it just seemed to be trying too hard and took me out of the movie. Crash is a good movie with solid writing, direction, and you really couldn't have asked for a better cast, but it is definitely not, in my mind, number sixty one on the two hundred and fifty greatest movies of all time."

","""Crash"" is a good film but over-hyped; in terms of both craft and subject matter, it is neither ground-breaking nor earth-shattering.<br/><br/>The movie's structure---following an ensemble of characters who cross paths via intersecting story lines---is interesting but not new. Director Robert Altman has done it for years, as have more recent flicks ranging from ""Pulp Fiction"" to ""Magnolia"" (both of which are better films than ""Crash"").<br/><br/>The flick's subject matter---exploring race relations and conflicts, in LA in this case---is important, but here the script falls short . The first 45 minutes is almost completely dominated by unsympathetic characters behaving in unsympathetic ways, a problem that isn't solved by having most of them flip into highly sympathetic behavior late in the story. If anything, this sort of ""cheat"" appears as a feeble attempt to create a ""nice Hollywood ending,"" which isn't what you'd expect (or want) from this sort of movie.<br/><br/>It is not the sort of movie I'd watch several times. Maybe twice. Disappointing. So I give it a 6."

","Rarely have I seen such a three dimensional problem handled so one-dimensionally. Previous reviewers have praised the film for its nuanced investigation of racism in the big city, its unwillingness to bend to stereotypes, and its (and I groan as I'm writing this) avoidance of ""easy answers to tough questions.""<br/><br/>I'm here to tell you that if you're looking for probing, nuanced film, you're going to have fast forward through a lot of CRASH: all of the beginning, the middle, most of the end. Stop at the credits to pay respect to some genuinely phenomenal actors, and then take the movie back to Blockbuster (or send it back to Netflix, if that's your thing) and try your luck at another movie, because at no point is this film get within striking distance of probing OR nuanced.<br/><br/>With CRASH, Paul Haggis attempts to show us the repercussions of racism in America. In an attempt to be brutally honest with his subject matter, Haggis has written a script completely devoid of stereotypes. Check out this dramatis personae:<br/><br/><ul><li>A racist cop - An African-American made good who is still pulled down in his culture's oppression - A bitchy upper class white woman - A young, attractive DA with political aspirations - Two inner city car thieves, one of whom likes nothing more than to wax poetic about the oppression which he sees absolutely everywhere - A Persian *convenience store owner* targeted for a hate crime because he looks Arab - An Asian woman whose only character trait is that she speaks broken English</li></ul><br/><br/>Okay, so... honestly. How deep could be we be delving into this problem with this cast of characters. EVERYONE is a stereotype, and just because at some point each of them transcends their stereotype does not mean that they are not still stereotypical characters. I've seen enough ""serious films"" in my life to know that no one is unequivocally good or bad. Everyone has nuance, and demonstrating that does not make a movie nuanced.<br/><br/>Which might be beside the point anyway, as I would contest that the world where this movie operates is not reality. It's some weird, pseudo reality where EVERYONE is racist ALL THE TIME. Can we take, for example, the scene where the white lawyer essentially says to the black cop ""What is the deal with you black people?"" Honestly, there is not one character in this entire movie who is not overtly racist. This is simply not like reality. I absolutely agree that everyone has their racial prejudices and preconceptions, but people (especially people who function in civilized society, as almost everyone in this movie does) learn to conceal those prejudices. This apparently not the case in whatever parallel universe in which CRASH takes place. The movie becomes less about excavating racism in America and more about excavating this apparently pandemic problem of people broadcasting their racism with a bullhorn and a sandwich board.<br/><br/>The idea of the film is fundamentally flawed. But, I'm giving it a five out of ten, because the cast is more or less strong and brings some level of depth to their otherwise flat and (even with that oh so original sprig of redemption) unlikeable characters. The dialogue is tight, even if it goes nowhere. The ending is too long and provides almost no closure (which often creates the illusion of ""not offering easy answers""). And I want to go on record as agreeing with previous commentators that Soderbergh should keep a better eye on his directing notebook, because I think Haggis has been stealing pages from it. All in all, an entertaining enough film to watch provided that you are not looking for any sort of probing commentary on American society at all.<br/><br/>Anyone who felt they learned something about racism from watching this movie has clearly never thought too hard about the subject. Yes, we're all a little racist. No, racists (even the overt ones) are not irrevocable demons. Yes, racism is endemic and self-replicating. No, racists aren't always white people. And if any of that comes as news to you, I strongly recommend that you buy a newspaper or, you know, turn on your TV or maybe open your eyes and take your fingers out of your ears."
"giomanombre","7","2","5","19 September 2005"," Touching moments, but felt contrived.
","As a dramatic movie it certainly has done its job. There is a wide range of highly emotional themes throughout the movie.<br/><br/>For example: 1) The Matt Dillon officer who sexually assaults a black man's wife in front of her husband and threatening to charge and arrest the couple with driving offenses on a traffic stop arising from his own personal frustrations, and is then subsequently forced to rescue her when she is upside down on a car in another scene.<br/><br/>2) The little girl jumping in to rescue his father by a mad Persian store owner that was going to kill him, and the shot firing, and nothing happening.<br/><br/>3) The supposedly 'good' morally upright cop that end up killing the black hitchhiker out of his own paranoia.<br/><br/>4) The Asian guy that got run over by the two Black people had a van full of girls or children that would have been sold as sex slaves. You feel sorry for the Asian guy, until you find out he is a woman-stealer, then you feel good he got hit real good with the stolen van, since that is what he did with the lives of the people in the van. Shows you cant feel sorry for people all the time when bad things happen.<br/><br/>The 'heightened' tense scenes were emotionally involving and rather convincing.<br/><br/>However, there is a sense of phoniness about the movie - that is for the most part contrived and not real (but then again it is not meant to be a documentary so what do you expect - it's a drama). Again, the actors are all well paid to represent problems that happen in poorer and violent communities they would not live in themselves, the director/writer is in their Ivory tower making money out of real problems they probably did not experience themselves, except the car crash."

","This film was not really about race, but about our own (as humans) contradictions and complexities. Nothing IS black and white, no one lives their lives without their own story, and that is what this film explores. It uses racism as a facilitator of this phenomena. This film could easily have dealt with sex or death or love in the same way. We all have our reasons for what we do and how we feel and none of us have clear and concise answers for how we live out our lives, but rather, have lifetimes worth of experiences that clout and enlighten our existence. This film did a superb job of exploring our conflictions and torments and ultimately our realizations for whatever they're worth."
"cal_culus3","8","2","5","1 September 2005"," Excellent Movie!!
","I had no idea, this movie had so much buzz around it. Of course not in a big commercial way. More like, this is one darn good movie. The main reason I watched this movie was because of the cast. So many good actors. But the clincher was the subject of the movie. This movie is based on RACISM!! I don't know or remember if many movies have addressed this issue. But, this movie will always remain with me. Not just because of its content, but also because of the way it was handled.<br/><br/>The tag line, 'you think you know who you are, you have no idea' says it all. I mean, how many of us who think we are not racists (or homophobes, this applies to many general issues) really aren't??? Deep down, we will always have a stigma. We may not know it or notice it. But my guess is, we will always have a nagging corner in the mind about a certain controversial issue. In this case racism.<br/><br/>This movie tries to deal with that aspect. HATS OFF to all the people who made this movie. Just to throw something at our faces like that!! I believe in the 'live and let live' policy. BUT, the question is, does that mean I'm not a racist?? I never got the whites and black dilemma. Maybe, that's 'cos I don't have so many colors to deal wit where I come from.<br/><br/>The movie has its clichés or bad moments. But the excellence of the entirety of the movie more than compensates for it. It deals with a random number of people in LA who deal with racism in their own way.<br/><br/>A white cop who looks like an outright racist, partnered with a rookie cop who thinks the other guy is being mean to blacks.<br/><br/>The DA, who looks like an all round good guy, but uses any angle he can get for good publicity. His wife, thinks she has to justify her fear of other races, or is she just afraid of her perfect life getting messed up??? A possible Ex-con with a family, trying to make his way in an untrusting world. A Persian family, who has to deal with what every other Muslim in the world has to?? Being labeled Osama!! The rich and famous black couple whose lives are not so easy just because they are rich and famous.<br/><br/>Then there's the cop, who's trying to make peace with his mother and try and bring her other wayward son back.<br/><br/>The wayward brother has no qualms about racism and hangs about with an extremely racist guy (gangbanger).<br/><br/>All in all, a perfect ensemble cast. With great acting. I could go on forever. This is by far the best movie of 2005!! Many think that its copying from Magnolia (anothe fantastic movie). Even if it does, who cares, this is one of the best movies ever. Every story involved has a twist.<br/><br/>On a side note, you get to see Jennifer Esposito's Boobs.<br/><br/>Do you really need any other reason to watch the movie?"
"magnidude","5","2","5","28 August 2005"," Vastly overrated, yet still worth watching
","This is a film with far greater ambitions than it actually reaches to.<br/><br/>Firstly, with all the slow pace, the multi-character cast, the coincidences, and failed symbolism as the snowflakes fall at the end, it tries to be something like Magnolia, but eventually ends up only as an overcliched and unsuccessful attempt. It lacks lyricism and allegorism of Magnolia. It lacks real plot to convey ideas. It's OK to have more than one or two parallel, equivalent characters in a film, you simply have to make it longer, but you ought to give them something to cling themselves to or they would fail to convince and to induce any sort of passionate feeling towards themselves in viewers. And then we watch a reportage rather than drama.<br/><br/>Secondly, it's supposed to be an anti-bigotry, anti-prejudice and anti-racist movie. Well, I don't know where the logic of vast part of people here has gone but for me this film failed to be like that too. It's more anti-racial than anti-racist, as the matter of fact, while depicting people of almost every race and origin as being awful (at least being awful sometimes - given the circumstances). So everybody has his dark side. I don't like to follow this. That's utterly untrue. Not everybody. And if this movie was supposed to teach us something, suddenly the message is: there's nobody there, no ideal to follow, no perfection you should try to achieve - everybody is corrupted so what if I am corrupted too. Ayn Rand called it ""the cult of the moral greyness"". So we have one cop who in a span of one day alters himself from molester and humiliator to saving-life hero, and the other cop who from a life-saving hero changes to murderer. What message is it? That really nice and decent people are in fact corrupted - they and we, the audience, only need specific circumstances to realize it. It sucks. That's searching perfection which makes us humane, not giving it up. ""Training Day"", for example, also showed corruption, incidentally at the same city, but it had at least a character fighting with it. Not giving up, for God's sake. Is it more plausible behavior? Maybe not, but if i'd like to see people behaving plausible and true, have I really go to the cinema to do that? No - that's not the purpose of cinema, that's not the purpose of any art - to duplicate reality. And given specific case of the murder - doesn't it convey yet another failed message? All in all, it proves that prejudice is useful. If the cop had followed the racial scheme not giving a lift, everybody would've been happy in the end. By the way I think its' true. Prejudice is useful. It's the reason it develops in a society. It grows on individual experiences stacked up to a general scheme. But I hardly suppose it was the message, makers of this movie wanted to pass.<br/><br/>I could evaluate on more specific details, but that should be enough. All in all, given today's cinema, it's still a movie worth watching."

During such moments they often would be accompanied by politically correct mellow dramatic gasps of disbelief from appalled middle aged females in the audience.

","I have no remorse whatsoever in saying this is one of the most ridiculous, pretentious, un-entertaining pieces of film work I have encountered in my short life. Sure, the cinematography is beautiful, but other than that, I despise this film with every fiber of my being. The whole time, I was slowly shaking my head with a grimace on my face, fighting the urge to stop the disc, take it out of the player, and snap it in half.<br/><br/>All of this movie has are film elements added into a script that should be underscored by real meaning and point, none of which it has. Every other word is ""f*ck"", almost every scene is two or more people shouting in anger in each other's faces, unnecessary violence sprouts up like dandelions on a clean lawn, and just to see if they couldn't make it worse, they add a sex scene with no meaning behind it in an attempt to ensnare people who love nudity. There is absolutely no character development. Ever character in this movie is portrayed the same - someone frustrated or angry at someone else with a serious need for therapy. There really isn't even any plot line. It's all just a bunch of events of people being d-bags to each other with no connection between them at all. It's like emotion attempted to be shoved down one's throat with no real justification for why it should even be there.<br/><br/>On top of all that, things like this movie are the very reason for all the social troubles depicted therein. Racism is definitely the predominant theme, which is blown way out of proportion in this movie anyway, and the only thing this movie is likely to do is make minorities want to hold themselves more proud so that more hatred and tension will be created in today's society. Though I'm sure not all are like this, minorities in this movie are shown to hate white people and have every reason to steal and murder them with no moral obligation not to. It is even indirectly said by one African-American character that there is no moral reason at all why a black man should not rob or shoot a white person. People don't seem to realize that if these problems in our society are to be ended, people should learn to live and get along with each other rather than making utter crap like this which will cause more hatred between people, or maybe just make others feel bad or guilty for reasons they should not.<br/><br/>Essentially, nothing but a movie about people being a--holes to each other with no meaning behind it at all. I sure hope no one's going to pull the if-you-hate-this-movie-it-means-you're-a-racist-prick card on me, though I wouldn't be surprised, as that kind of attitude is exactly what this movie promotes.

Using LA locations was more expensive for the production studio than many other locations they could've opted for, but instead they wanted to give a feel of a possibly icky side of LA itself. They don't overharp on how the movie is based in LA as the sequence of events could happen anywhere in an infinite number of possibilities. But there is something about how they chose the location that makes it seem all so real. Maybe you have to have lived near LA to appreciate the choices of the locations and how hard it was to shoot and keep the locations on hold. <br/><br/>I think the actors and actresses were well chosen. There's not one bad actor or actresses. Even the child in the movie with the cloak line is great! There are too many examples to point out, but I will try to mention a few that come to mind. Danza is very subtle with his character's Fred's subtlety to the racism in his intonation. Cameron's understanding that he has no choice but to fake his pleasure and accept Fred's superficial niceness to complete the show is so perfect. Dillon is an f'in scary, racist cop who gets away with his attitude as people don't want to end up having the LA cops pinned down on them in particular. Phillippe, who plays ""good"" cop officer Hanson, ends up in a situation where it becomes twisted and very questionable. As viewers, we wonder if Officer Hanson should report what he did to others and why he did it, or if he should just destroy the evidence. Since the cops in the plot line will not try to give Hanson a ""fair and equal trial,"" you can guess what decision he makes and how much talking from the viewers there will be from just that. There are some twisted coincidences that were obviously placed in there to make the collage juicier and interesting. <br/><br/>The scene where a kid is ""shot"" is interesting because at first I thought she was wearing an ""impenetrable vest"" but then I noticed later on that the bullets used are blanks. They show the box really quickly, so if you miss those few seconds, you might not notice that small detail. <br/><br/>When the Persian father has trouble with Daniel, the locksmith, it brings an interesting question of what would a person might do if they need a door fixed and it's the middle of the night. Does he stay there all night and then finally try to get in touch with someone during the day? Probably. The situation is also questionable because the locksmith already put the lock on, but still wanted to charge the guy even though the lock could not be put on. <br/><br/>It's arguments like these you can continue having. That is what makes this movie so great!"

","In 1994, there was a little film called Pulp Fiction which almost had the sort of concept. Within a 36-48 hour period, everyone's lives would collide. Maybe Pulp Fiction appealed more to pop culture interests, but Tarantino did the job effectively (as Pulp Fiction is the only film of his I genuinely like). Now, flash forward to 2005, and this concept, already explored 10 years ago, is the darling of critics. For what reason? Crash deals with prejudice they say. Wow. I guess To Kill A Mockingbird doesn't. The writing is poor, and the acting is simply lousy. At the beginning of the film, Don Cheadle says something about everyone's lives crashing together. No kidding. A white guy starts a verbal fight with a Muslim by calling him Osama. And really, when you see the film, the fight was instigated for no reason. Matt Dillon pulls over an African-American couple because the wife was performing fellatio on her husband? Who comes up with this stuff? Then, to make it worse, he feels her up. What is going on here? One of the most hysterical parts was when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. The way they made it out to be was as if she died or something. Don't even get me started with the Muslim man ""encountering an angel"" that he shot with blank bullets. I guess he'll be like Samuel L. in Pulp Fiction and try to find God. Or how about the hideous banter between Ludicrous and his partner? Again, Paul Haggis tried to make this look like Pulp Fiction. And I knew right from the get-go that Ludicrous' partner was Cheadle's brother, although there is no mention of this until the middle of the film. And what about the Chinese lady who got into the car accident with Don Cheadle's partner? It just doesn't add up. I know everyone on this website is going to chastise me for tearing this film to shreds, calling me ""an idiot"" or I didn't see ""the significance"" of it.

","Crash is not a movie for everyone. If you want a Disney fairy tale with a Hollywood ending, do not watch this movie. If you want a mindless tale of action, or romance, or a comedy - this movie is not for you. If you can't bear tragedy and abuse on the screen, this movie above all will be a waste of your time and money. If you are looking for an intelligent movie with intriguing characters and an unforeseeable plot, you can not find a better movie in the 21st century.<br/><br/>Crash is about several people living in Los Angeles that deal with emotional and practical problems. Yes, it is a vague description, but I did label this comment as a non-spoiler so that's as detailed as I can get. I will say this however. From the very start, the plot takes turns that are absolutely un-foreseen. Those of you who watch movies to impress your friends by figuring out the whole plot a third the way through - don't even try (you will be embarrassed). One of the best aspects of this movie is how unpredictable it is and how it breaks stereotypes . The characters are all three-dimensional, and are loved and hated. The writing is amazing and so is acting.<br/><br/>Despite all the great components of the film listed above, it is not without it's own problems. First of all, I won't use any specific examples, but Crash is a tough movie to watch and you will feel bad for 90% of the 100 minute film. The movie for the most part is not entertaining, the stories within it are dark and miserable. You must also watch the movie with an open mind - any plot turns and events must be accepted no matter how unlikely they may seem.<br/><br/>If you can keep an open mind and deal with the darkness, Crash will be mind-blowing. It will give you a view on people and life no other movie does. Truly, saying that Crash is a must-see movie is an understatement."

","When I first saw CRASH last year I was completely swept up in the emotion of the story,like most people would be that have only viewed it once. After seeing it a second time I could see that while the cast was amazing the screenplay was utterly contrived and while rooted deep in the soul it is baseless in realism. CRASH takes you on a melodramatic and rather surreal emotional roller-coaster but is far too preachy without showing any ideas of resolution. We only see the ridiculous interdependence of the main characters and how they are connected through one another in a Shakespearean like fashion. I would say CRASH is very entertaining no doubt about that but as a film that makes a strong social statement as so many have claimed, it falls flat on it's face due to the contrived nature of the screenplay. The only thing that saves CRASH for me is the brilliant cast."
"cdn_moviefan","Null","3","10","9 March 2006"," Film searches deeply within
","It's been quiet some time since this movie came out. I saw it when it was first released in theatres. I'm back to comment on it, as it got some bashing for it's Oscar awards. Frankly, in the year 2005 - there weren't any top notch, note worthy films of mass appeal. There wasn't.<br/><br/>I remember thinking: This movie will be overlooked. Theoretically, the award voters only remember movies from the last few months of a calendar year. I was surprised to see Crash was nominated - they hadn't forgotten it. I haven't forgotten that movie either. It's one of the rare times that a movie connects with an audience. It makes you: squirm, wince, look away like you've been slapped, slack jawed - the gamut of human emotions.<br/><br/>People who blow off this movie can't relate to it, because their lives have been truly untouched. Untouched by, and naive of anything as traumatically experienced by the characters in this movie. The characters in this movie attempt this as well. To be insensitive to others' emotions and traumas. And the cause-and-effect they and others have on each other in the world. They portray realistic people trying to carry on in a cold unfeeling world.<br/><br/>This world where people blow this movie off. They have not experienced what the characters have, nor know of anyone close to them that has. The world of soap bubbles, balloons, cars for birthdays, and occasionally family members that die of very old age.<br/><br/>I wasn't a huge fan of Matt Dillon and his filmography of d-uh characters. Crash was the 12th movie I've seen him in. This is the first one that Dillon impressed me with. (The Flamingo Kid was enjoyable, and still makes me laugh, but I digress.) Matt Dillon was strikingly realistic in this movie. His character was beyond three dimensional. The entire cast was noteworthy, and it's difficult to pick just one outstanding actor in it. He was nominated for an Oscar in a supporting role. That's a puzzle to me. If you've seen the movie, it's an interwoven multi-story lined movie. There were no leads in this movie. It's that strong of a powerhouse cast.<br/><br/>This movie kept me awake for much of the night afterwards. It was disturbingly realistic. I know people like those people. It was only the second movie I walked out of in my entire life. The first one was Mississippi Burning. That one, I left completely, and never saw it until it came out on video. With Crash, well I'm older now. With that, I left and paced the lobby during a particular scene. It was too much for me to watch. I cameback, and the person I went with filled me in on those five minutes."
"michaelRokeefe","8","3","10","25 September 2005"," Does it take a 'crash' to strip bare your soul?
","CRASH is provocative, disturbing, controversial and touches the anger, fear, hatred and prejudice inside us all. Intelligently written expose on the interlocking lives of a dozen people brought together by a car crash in Los Angeles. Stereotyping by ethnic backgrounds and sexual persuasion. Matt Dillon is a racist cop. Don Cheadle is a black detective with a Latina partner and lover(Jennifer Esposito). Terrence Howard is a rich TV director and his wife(Thandie Newton)would love to pass for white or resent other than African American. A district attorney(Brendan Fraser)and his highly pretentious wife(Sandra Bullock)are victims of a car-jacking by two young, differently opinionated black men(""Ludicrous"" Bridges and Larenz Tate). Also in this diverse ensemble: Tony Danza, Ryan Phillipe, Michael Pena, Loretta Devine and Art Chudabala. CRASH is a disparate tale of interaction, reaction, confrontation and racial tolerance. Can't a man do a little bit wrong? Kudos to Paul Haggis for the direction of his own story and screenplay."
"thegeegees-1","9","3","10","23 September 2005"," What a brilliant movie
","I have just watched Crash, and I have to say I thought it was a brilliant movie. The acting is excellent, and I was pleasantly surprised by Matt Damon's performance, very strong. The viewer has to pay special attention to virtually every character in the film; they will all become important links in the chain later on.<br/><br/>I would have to agree with other reviewers on the subject of the race card, it is played a lot throughout the film, but not to the point of dominating the whole thing. In fact, although the main characters are black, and the ""bad guys"" seem to be all white, it is more about fear and ignorance of class, as it is of colour.<br/><br/>Crash has a cast that will not be household names in the UK, but many will have been spotted in minor roles in other movies. In much the same way as Hill Street Blues did when it first aired in the UK, the quality of the acting and the script, makes you care about these people, as the series Lost is doing here right now.<br/><br/>I would advise first time watchers to take note of all that is happening around the characters, however small a role it appears they are playing. The movie is really split into two halves, in many ways a case of crime and redemption. <br/><br/>In the first half we are introduced to the characters, many of which would seem to have little or no chance of ever crossing each others paths. We will love some and hate others, only to go through a complete sea change of emotions later on.<br/><br/>The movie in its second phase, then develops characters that played seemingly insignificant roles, they now become a very different and more important ingredient in the climax to the film. To avoid spoiling the film for Crash ""virgins"" I will not comment too much on the plots. It is better to let the movie unravel for you and allow you to make your own judgement about the justification for their behaviour.<br/><br/>In closing, I would recommend this film to just about everyone. Get a pizza in, a few beers and take the phone off the hook. Then, with an open mind, sit back and be entertained."

But that didn't disappoint me.<br/><br/>So you ask me what Crash is about and I will tell you this: Crash is about ordinary people in America from every ethnicity and how all their lives are connect. It's about the hidden and open racism that every ethnicity has, it's about the little things we do that can actually be a disaster for others, it's about change and to see the world through new eyes.<br/><br/>In short it's about everyday life and how our everyday actually is connected to so many other people most of them without us knowing it.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an action movie (as many people on my screening were) you will be disappointed.

","If you have hate in your body, see Crash. If you have love in your body, see Crash. It is worth every penny and perhaps more that I spent on seeing it. Don Cheadle, who I first recognized from those NFL playoff commercials, does a masterful job in his character. He perfectly brings a blend of arrogance and intelligence. Sandra Bullock goes out of character, but does a fairly good job of portraying the bigoted, white, trophy wife. Dillon brings back memories of the angry, white man, who is a sexually-depraved bigot police officer. His performance is a haunting story of a man who can't stand his own bigotry, but has deep down feelings of hatred in his body. Thandie Newton is memorable as the female half of a biracial couple, a woman who knows what she wants out of a relationship. Go see Crash, you will regret it if you don't. If you don't see it, then you will remain a bigot."
"socatranceformer","10","3","10","30 May 2005"," Truly one of the best movies of all time. Everybody needs to see it.
","This movie was possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I will own it when it comes out simply for the ability to spread its message to people who have not seen it. When people ask me what it's about, I give a one word answer. Racism. Plain and simple, that's what it's about. We follow several different character stories, from a Persian family, a high class black family, 2 policemen, a detective, a DA and his wife, 2 young black adults, and a Hispanic man with his family. No character, save for the Hispanic man(possibly the best acting in the movie) is without flaw. This movie is brutally honest and shows the truth of our American society. It educates everybody that white people are not the only racist group in America. Racism takes form in all cultures, classes, and races. I have never seen better acting from any of these individuals, especially Thandie Newton and Sandra Bullock. Don Cheadle is right up there with his role in Hotel Rwanda. Ludicrous is surprisingly brilliant as a self righteous racist black man. I cannot name a single bad thing about this movie. It is heavy, but it really needs to be in order to be effective. There are some small comic reliefs to break up the tension, which are tuned and timed perfectly. I cannot express enough how worthwhile this movie is. High schools should show this movie to their students(unfortunately w/ permission slips due to it's R rating from nudity and language)."

","CRASH (2005) **** Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, Keith David, Loretta Devine, William Fichtner, Michael Pena, Shaun Toub, Bahar Soomekh, Nona Gaye, Bruce Kirby, Tony Danza, Ashlyn Sanchez, Beverly Todd. (Dir: Paul Haggis)<br/><br/>""Grand Canyon"" meets ""Short Cuts""  thought provoking button-pusher for the 21st Century.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis , Oscar nominated for his screenplay adaptation for ""Million Dollar Baby"" this year and in his directorial debut proves a force to be reckoned with, with his provocative, hot button topic of racism running rampant in Los Angeles as a metaphor for the rest of the nation: a boiling pot potboiler.<br/><br/>The common thread of good and bad people interlaced with class, social status and race relations come to a head with several vignettes of an atypical 24 hour period in LA where a too-bothered for a commitment or relationship police detective named Graham (Cheadle, who also produced) is straddling his affair with a fellow cop (the sexy Esposito), a Latina who has little patience for his indifference as they investigate a cop-related shooting wherein an undercover cop has killed another undercover cop in a car shooting which leads to a politically motivated fuse lit by the district attorney (Fraser) - who has been recently car-jacked with his high-strung bitchy wife (Bullock in a nice turn from her usual America's Sweetheart display) who can barely tolerate their Hispanic maid  attempting to avoid any disclosure of the embarrassing crime by rewarding a civil servant of color to win him votes. <br/><br/>Meanwhile a bigoted cop (Dillon in one of his best performances) and his rookie partner (Phillippe, ditto) have just stopped a Navigator that matches the APB about the car-jacking which results in his harassing a buppie couple (the amazing Howard and Newton) who have been engaging in fellatio to make matters worse.<br/><br/>In the mix are an Iranian shopkeeper (Toub), his daughter (the striking Soomekh), a Mexican locksmith (Pena), two black wannabe gangstas (rapper Ludicrous and Tate), a by-the-book black police captain (David) and a balls-out racist publicist (Fichtner). <br/><br/>Haggis does a commendable skillful job with his tricky screenplay (co-written with Robert Moresco) and allows his fine ensemble cast free reign by allowing enough rope to twist and intertwine until the jigsaw puzzle begins to fall into place in how each little story relates to the other. His dialogue rings smart, true and all-too familiar with wit, irony and humanity ringing throughout like a clarion call to arms in its scathing, no punches held profile in how one human being can treat another without realizing they too are being profiled or worse misunderstood due to pre-conceived borderline racist beliefs and stereotypes. The most difficult is the good-hearted, well meaning but seen-it-all Dillon whose brimming with sarcasm encounter with a beaurocrat (Devine) when he is attempting to seek help for his very sick father (Kirby) and his barely concealed hatred spilling over with seemingly justifiable anger. It's a difficult role  a prick with good intentions  yet Dillon does so with a somewhat agile turn. <br/><br/>The remainder of the cast is all equally good  Cheadle has some fine moments as anticipated with his stillness and disbelief; Phillippe as a green cop who thinks he can control situations beyond his grasp  particularly with his two encounters with Howard (easily one of the best working actors on screen today) a TV director whose light-skinned wife Newton also show her skills to be remarkably subtle and the heart-in-your-throat moment of an irate Toub facing Pena (who has a truly wonderful moment previously with his daughter, the adorable Sanchez, giving her an invisible cloak of safety that brings tears to the eyes) at his home over a grievous misunderstanding. <br/><br/>Haggis has crafted a combination of what Lawrence Kasdan attempted to explain in ""Grand Canyon"" by a quasi-Altman ""Short Cuts' approach  mixing characters up in situations that are universal yet oddly alien to those he depicts experiencing. A truly damning indictment of America."
"RJBurke1942","9","4","16","15 January 2007"," A day in the lives  and deaths  of LA citizens...
","As Paul Newman said in Cool Hand Luke (1967), just before his character was killed off, ""What we've got here is failure to communicate...""<br/><br/>You could say that is THE theme of this well-crafted drama of life in La-La Land. And, yet, as you follow the lives of six or seven disparate couples, and how many interact during the course of thirty-six hours, the writer/director, Paul Haggis, brings a true sense of what it means to communicate, for good and for evil, and how what is said doesn't always mean what is said. Human communication is complex, and all too often, too many factors get in the way to proper listening -- really listening to what somebody is trying to tell you...<br/><br/>Aye, there's the rub, as the bard once said.<br/><br/>So, there is no main story  there are many different vignettes, many of which directly crisscross  or crash into  each other, however fleetingly. And, as the viewer, you see just what happens when two or more people fail to understand the significance of what they see, what has happened, and what they think they know. The twists and turns are delicious (I'm not talking about driving, okay) and there are some surprise moments that just might take your breath away... (The whole narrative is way too episodic to convey in words, in a review such as this; I could write 5000 words on this film, but that would bore you.)<br/><br/>So, that's another theme: nothing is ever as it seems. There's always something more, something that might be hidden, unknown, unrealized. Hence, the consequences of getting things wrong are all too well played out by the great cast: gritty in its realism, shocking in the results, and all too true to life...<br/><br/>Of special mention is the stark contrast between the racist cop, John Ryan (Matt Dillon), and the new, idealistic recruit, Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillipe) as they work through their differences on the job. At first, it seems that Ryan has no redeeming qualities, so much so that the young Hansen manages to get reassigned, away from Ryan, after lodging a complaint about him for harassing a black couple. And yet, Ryan provides one of the most traumatically uplifting moments in the whole movie with a selfless  and hugely ironic  act of heroic bravery, while his ex-partner Hansen  flushed with his own self-importance  comes face to face with his own fundamental inadequacy, as a human being, in the worst possible way. But it's all just another day on the job...<br/><br/>Some critics might say that too much of the narrative depended upon coincidence. But life is chaotic, the universe thrives on it at all levels, and we all know that strange coincidences have happened to each of us. You wouldn't believe some that have happened to me, driving around the city I live in. Or, maybe you would?<br/><br/>Don Cheadle, as detective Graham Waters, is the one character that the camera follows the most. So, on that basis, I would say it's mostly about him, seeing as how the film starts and (almost) ends with him on the screen. In actual fact, however, Paul Haggis remains true to good narrative sense and starts and ends the film with similar events, in this case, a collision between two cars. These days, what better icon for a city is there, anyway?<br/><br/>Haggis has written and directed a film that owes much to Robert Altman, I think. Those who know the latter's work would tend to see that influence here also. As I loved most of Altman's movies, I found this one just as satisfying, if perhaps a little more jerky at the cuts and scene changes. But, I'm not complaining: this is movie making at its best, with a haunting soundtrack, and if you haven't seen and heard it, then I'd urge you to do so.<br/><br/>It's quite violent in parts, there are sex scenes, but all of it is in context; nothing in this narrative is gratuitous. It's how cities are -- it's how they are..."

This film will probably garner many comparisons to ""Traffic"" which would not do it justice.

","The comparison to Robert Altman is deliberate, and fans of Altman will find a lot to like here. Los Angeles is the canvas and we get to see it in cross-section: by race, class, gender, ethnicity, income. There is a lot of coincidence at work here to weave these diverse strands together, but in surprising ways. As they intertwine, we learn a lot about each individual strand: those we dislike at first are humanized, those we give easy sympathy to are frequently shown in a harsher light.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent. Surprises include a loud-mouthed Ludicrous (Chris Bridges, Matt Dillon who has never been this good before, and Michael Pena in an understated role as a father trying to reassure his child. The always excellent Don Cheadle gives the movie its center, though he get no more screen time than the other main characters.<br/><br/>There is humor here, too, the hard-edged, sometimes mean-spirited jokes you tell when you're not being PC.

"garbledtext","3","3","11","11 May 2006"," Crash-a rare combination of a quasi-artistic form with an artless content
","With too intricate a structure and too stilted a style, the movie Crash is prevented from arriving at the essence of the subject matter it deals with. The complicated set-up of the narrative structure, the unnatural connections between characters, together with the over-usage of coincidence contribute to the story only on a dramatic level. It does help elaborate the point of the film in many directions, except that it is pretty much on same depth instead of going further for a deeper exploration of the potential the film has. It is disappointing in a film with the ambition in handling such a rich and meaningful issue.<br/><br/>What raises my expectation high and then lets me down is the style of the movie, or the gesture the movie holds, to be better put. The constant self-comments on the subject matter, the sophisticated philosophical voice-over, the soundtrack with big orchestra symphony and the graceful camera movements with poetic images all work hard to remind me that this has to be an insightful and artistic movie and that it is taping a real hard-core topic. This is of course, the reflection of the self-awareness of the director who is eager to deliver the message as to how he wants us to see the film instead of letting the film itself do the job. Not to mention the message delivered by the gesture is utterly misleading as the content of the film is actually very unpretentious and it touches us in a simple and more direct way.<br/><br/>The title Crash works on a metaphorical level nicely (another example of how self-aware the filmmaker is), but as a feature-length film, it is far from enough to justify a structure in which several separate stories are also in a ""crash""--meaning they are just put together artificially by awkward coincidences and forced connections among characters. The savor of the movie is actually each individual storythey are effective and powerful. I believe that it is a mistake to make the raw material of Crash into a feature film and it'd be so much better to make a few really good short films out of it. My advice is: losing the structure and the gesture as well as the self-comments, plus director giving up the role of a deep thinker as there is really not much fruits of thoughts but some truly touching human stories that should be told in a very simple and sincere way. Only then, the real and various thoughts will rise at the liberty of each viewer with a personal perspective to it. After all, with the topic the film discusses, it is frivolous even to attempt to provide an answer whereas to ask questions that may lead us to think about it from a different angle is what the best a film can do.<br/><br/>When I am writing this, I am thinking of the conversation Stanley Kubrick and Frederic Raphael had during their cooperation on the screenplay of Eyes Wide Shut. Stanley mentioned that he had always wanted to make a film about the Holocaust but he didn't know how; and Frederic named Schindler's List as an example. Stanley said: is it a film about the Holocaust? Frederic answered: it isn't? Stanley : No, it is not. It is about the VICTORY. One man's victory.<br/><br/>This is how heavy I would imagine this film could potentially weigh and how humble a film and filmmaker have to be towards the issue."
"pngallagher","3","3","11","4 May 2006"," Crash: MTV American Idealism.
","Caution: Please note that I do marginally indicate to the film's plot in this commentary.<br/><br/>Like many Hollywood films imbued with seamless continuity, a swelling orchestral soundtrack, and a star power cast, ""Crash"" draws in a mainstream audience looking for a narrative of dramatic patriotism veiled in self-praising humanism. As director Paul Haggis contends, the multiculturalist issues in American democracy aren't simply black and white, and white isn't necessarily always right; it is something much greater. And yet, what I feel we're working with here is merely a 6-pack crayola spectrum: you might as well throw out the rest of the crayons because all that is being used is red, white (no crayon needed), and blue.<br/><br/>This film seems to aim at an American redemption of the past years leading back to 9/11: a day forever fixed in the American political axis of xenophobia. Rightly so, Americans do need to rectify past racial transgressions between each other and feel better about their nationalism since that fateful day. It was the day when the Western 'Graceland' was eternally tainted by fear and the abstract notion of terrorism that lay in everyone's bed beside them began to stir; people became ugly and cultural spaces would homogeneously cluster together for security. This is ""Crash."" The distanciation that came from fear, in time, hardened into hate and then died in to indifference This is where Haggis believes that America's melting pot has melted, cooled, and solidified in to country of segregation; no more is there a sense of patriotic 'unity', only a distopic decay of American idealism. <br/><br/>With such narrative strains as Matt Dillon's character, a police officer, the soldier of the people is carefully framed in his redemption scene, saving Thandie Newton, distinctly echoing the patriotic iconography found during the wake of September 11th. This film desperately tries to re-establish that American illusion of democracy that has made its citizens faithfully check their culture at the door and step in line to march for an estranged capitalist political agenda. All the while, Haggis serves it to them in a pop culture tagline ""You think you know who you are, You have no idea,"" oddly resembling the MTV Diaries quip, ""You think you know, but you have idea,"" a show that interestingly enough employs a 'reality effect' in trying to construct marketable humanists out of celebrity identities. I think the American audience is too smart for this and perhaps realize as others witness their awakening concern in politics, the film's cathected idea of freedom is simply not enough. They want actual freedom not something served to them by circumscription with the hollow promise of an abstract ideal. I think what is not shown in Haggis' film is that American democratic freedom is gradually being realized as not an ideal, but an idea. <br/><br/>""Crash"" does start out to be more than just black and white and takes on multiculturism's demons head on, but by the end, it's difficult to see any colour from the constant white washing on the ""Hollywood"" hills sign."

","Now I saw this in theatres and I didn't know what to expect. But the first thing that went through my mind when I was walking out of that theatre was WOW! I recommend that everyone watches this movie. I don't care your age, your gender, your different liking of genres, this movie is amazing. Paul Haggis really pulled this off, and now I know what the fuss was about. Now when I saw that Ludicriss was casted in this movie I was a little bit confused. But he as well pulled this off %100. Well, for all you movie lovers this one will have you thinking until the end of the movie. It will have you thinking until the end of the week. I recommend everyone to watch this.

","This has some of the best writing I have ever seen. This movie goes to the heart of the race problem and show it in a way that we can all relate to and understand, but the best thing is the way the story interweaves the characters showing each for who he is and leaves all who see it affected and discussing it after having seen it. Everyone should take the time to see this movie and try to gain a better understanding of how others relate one to another. Beyond the script the acting is great! The filming of the movie is done in a very realistic and believable way so as to transport you right to the heart of the events. The emotion created in one scene in particular was so well done that my wife began balling and it was all I could do to not join her. Do not miss this one!!!!"

"Vomitron_G","9","3","11","4 March 2006"," Life is a healing process
","**** I have to get one thing of my chest first, concerning some reviewers here on this movie's web-page: I've read several comments of reviewers who hate this movie that were shockingly insulting. I felt personally offended. They actually have the nerve to explicitly insinuate that everyone who likes this movie is lacking intelligence, shallow or just plain stupid. I saw CRASH together with my brother and we both thought it was nothing short of being excellent. We are actually regarded as being well-educated persons (with a love for cinema in general), so who are you to call us morons? I kindly, yet firmly, ask all of you so-called intellectuals to refrain yourselves from such insulting statements in the future (since you're not likely to come back here and remove or edit your posts). ****<br/><br/>Ensemble-pictures have become a genre of their own and I myself have still to encounter the first bad one in this genre. CRASH can be compared to a lot of movies, but I don't think Iñárritu's 21 GRAMS is one of them (For the record: I think 21 GRAMS is a masterpiece and CRASH is 'just' excellent). I really love it when a movie demands the attention of the viewer. And I'm even more pleased when that attention is rewarded on several occasions. Some events in CRASH are predictable but you can never exactly predict how the events will occur or what the outcome will be. I hate to break the news to all of you who hate this movie, but that's clever scriptwriting. The whole cast gives a more than decent performance, even though not all of them are first-rate talents.<br/><br/>I'm not going to praise this movie by telling you all the things I liked about it, but instead I'm going to explain why I didn't give it 10 out of 10 stars. For example, on at least two occasions I had the feeling that writer/director Paul Haggis underestimates the intelligence of the viewer. After the pay-off of the initial set-ups, Haggis often shows us totally redundant shots of things we already know (the address on the dashboard, the blanks in the red box). The viewer is perfectly capable of figuring that out by himself. Also, I did find the whole racism-theme too dominant throughout the movie. Simply every character has issues with it to that point it almost becomes annoying. This movie is about so many other things too, so Haggis could have easily put more emphasis on those other subjects. On a final note, I sometimes felt the musical score was a bit inappropriate.<br/><br/>In the end those are just minor problems. CRASH simply is an excellent movie and one that deserves to be seen. I must add, however, even if the characters all felt 100% realistic, the actual events portrayed in CRASH don't always reflect real life (in my opinion). But then again it is still a movie. If you liked Altman's SHORT CUTS and Anderson's MAGNOLIA, then CRASH might be right up your alley. And if you liked them all, then please take the effort to watch Tom Barman's ANYWAY THE WIND BLOWS, one of the finest movies to come out of Belgium for a long time. One more thing about CRASH: It does contain at least one basic truth about life: You Live, You Learn, You Change."
"brenttraft","10","3","11","4 March 2006"," Best Film of 2005
","""Crash"" is easily the best film of 2005. Despite that, it is a very controversial film that has it detractors and some people really hate this film.<br/><br/>The people who hate this film do so because they take it literally. Like all great works of literature, it is a parable for the the world we live in, not an accurate depiction. This is not a documentary. There is a multitude of characters who are all racist, victim, and hero at the same time. The snowing at the end represents that improbable things could happen at any time.<br/><br/>The dialog is the crown jewel of the film and has more impact than explosions. The ensemble acting is first rate. Sandra Bullock only has a small roll, but gives the best performance of her career. Don Cheadle shows that he belongs in with the top tier of actors. The photography and cinematography is better than most. Only a couple of rock songs at the end of the film detract from an otherwise first rate production. The dialog is abrasive. The violence is sudden and shocking. People were gasping in the theater when I saw it. The film does not pay anyone any favors. It is sure to be offensive no matter what your skin color. It is an equal opportunity offender.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is one of the very best films of all time."

I am normally a fan of the ""chick flick"", and so finding this film was such a chance, but I loved it. I really would watch it again and again. The first time round, I admit, I found it a little confusing until it all came together at the end.

"scottkr","4","3","11","2 January 2006"," Allegory full of clichés
","OK, I admit to being a hater of 'LA movies.' From Grand Canyon to Magnolia and now Crash, movie makers have featured these universally unlikeable, self-absorbed, and plasticene ensembles of a dozen or so characters. The problem is, they are just not interesting (my wife walked out after 40 minutes; I regret staying to the inconclusive end). They live in cloistered, boring, pampered strip-mall suburbs and fuss over inanity that would make the rest of the World roll their eyes. What's worse, is that Haggis gives each character two very 2-dimensional sides. Each has their 'really, really good' side and their 'really, really bad' side. The movie thumps this 'Yin-Yang' theme with drumbeat regularity, and we are expected to derive some moral lesson by each characters' inevitable comeuppance. Fine for an HBO movie-of-the-month, but not worthy of the big screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Haggis, the obviousness of his attempts at audience manipulation is its undoing. He needs to follow in the foosteps of the 1920s expats-in-Paris, to discover how to make subtle character-driven drama from the French or Italian cinema.<br/><br/>'Oh wow! Look, a movie set in LA - that's where I live.' says the LA local, presumably. Maybe if I lived there I might appreciate these characters and derive some thrill from seeing my home town on screen. I don't, however, think LA locals live in the contrived LA of Crash - where serendipity can drive 10 different people together over and over, again and again. Haggis' LA is a village of a few dozen fear-gripped kind-hearted racists. C'mon guys, show us the real LA some time?"

The jumps were smooth and flawless. The lighting enhanced every scene. The original score and selected song placement was perfect.

","Given the thinness of the recent crop, it's a lame compliment to call ""Crash"" the best film I've seen to this point in 2005: mid-May. But it's a stunner in several ways. The acting is consistently fine, though, since most or all of the roles are not so central as to be considered leads, the actors may not get nominations. Too bad there isn't an ensemble category. The script is exceptional...an intricate weave of plot threads, and not one single loose end at the finish. The music is beautifully chosen, the cinematography is great, and the movie is not without a strong redemptive feeling at the end. It shows human nature as deeply flawed in some respects, but there isn't a single character who comes off as a cardboard stereotype. I hope the movie gets the success it deserves."
"splait1","10","3","11","14 May 2005"," A must-see film that is sometimes hard to watch
","This movie is disturbing and dark. You could call it a horror film, but it's based on how our society (American) exists in too many places today.<br/><br/>Blind anger. Anger without thought. What it does. How it affects others. It's scary how people treat each other in this movie. And yet, I can see it all happening in the ""real"" reality (not what is called ""reality"" on TV.) <br/><br/>Don Cheadle is soft, hard, caring, and very conflicted. His character is caught up in events he cannot control. Sandra Bullock plays out of character - a woman who is just angry and scared. No one seems to notice enough to care.<br/><br/>Shaun Toub plays an Persian who appears to distrust and hate anyone who is outside of his family. He has blind rages. He doesn't see others as real. They are just in his way.<br/><br/>The other characters are played just as real, and the situations are believable. And they took me to places I didn't want to go.<br/><br/>Every day, I see people wandering around in their heads - that is, they are too busy thinking about what happened yesterday, or the performance review meeting they have with their boss next week, or the fight he or she had with his/her spouse this morning. Too many people living somewhere other than the moment. Not seeing what (or who) is around them. Not letting those people in.<br/><br/>When something happens to break their concentration, many of these people react with anger or disinterest. Polite gestures by others go unnoticed - no response (""thank you"") for someone holding a door open, or for someone opening a hole in traffic.<br/><br/>What kind of interruption is necessary for these people to come into the moment and recognize that there are other people around them with needs, desires, dreams, and many of the same issues that you or I have to deal with? To see them as people, and to treat them with respect and courtesy? <br/><br/>As I said, this movie can be hard to watch. Go see it. Then go out and be that ""interruption"" in people's lives. Bring them into the moment, even if it is just to say ""Hello"" and and make eye contact. Let them know that you recognize them as a fellow human being, not really any different than you or me. Maybe if enough people do that, we can turn things around on this planet."

It's a film with a heart and soul, something Hollywood is sorely lacking. It has the cast that every film should have: Actors who can play their parts to the rafters and create something real. The only ""name"" in the film (Sandra Bullock) has an altogether minor role. The real stars in this film are Don Cheadle, Ryan Phillippe, Brandon Frasier, Shaun Toub, Michael Pena, and Chris Bridges (yes, even Ludicrous put his persona aside to give a wonderful performance), with bitingly wonderful supporting roles from William Fitchner, Keith David, and Loretta Devine.

While it is NOT a film I recommend to everyone (see later in my review for more on this), it's a brilliantly creative film that is more like riding an insane roller coaster for 110 minutes! Seriously.<br/><br/>Describing the plot in this film is VERY difficult. In fact, if I tried, the film might seem ordinary but it certainly isn't. Suffice to say that the movie consists of many separate stories in Los Angeles that all come together in a strange tapestry. And, most of the stories involve gun violence, race prejudice and misunderstandings. I just can't say much more to describe it--see it and experience an emotional film that will leave you numb and make your heart skip a few beats.<br/><br/>Now as I said above, the film is not for everyone--though it is brilliant. There's a lot of harsh language (necessary for the plot--not gratuitous) and the movie is a serious emotional roller coaster. You will probably feel about to cry and it will affect you--I can't see how it can't.

"rcfp08","10","2","6","1 August 2010"," Review of Crash
","Today's day in age there is a lot of racial discrimination against every race on this earth. This film brings this to the big screen and to every viewer's attention. This film makes the viewer realize how common it is and how maybe even themselves may be guilty of it. This film has many popular actors and actresses including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Loretta Divine, Matt Dillon, Ludicrous, Ryan Phillippe, Terrence Howard, Larenz Tate, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Michael Pena, and William Fichtner. The story begins with a crash where racial slurs are thrown amongst those involved. The story then rewinds back to the beginning and begins to tell the story of all the actors and how they all are discriminated upon because of their race and vice versa. Throughout the movie, based in Los Angeles, California, many of the stories amongst the actors begin to intertwine with each other over the course of two days. Those that was once guilty of having racial discrimination come to terms that those that they discriminate against may be the ones that rely on the most. The many different stories that are told within the one film and the relationship amongst the characters were similar to the film Training Day with Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. <br/><br/>The first scene as mentioned is the car crash involving Ria, Jennifer Esposito, and an Asian woman who does not speak very well English. The Asian woman pronounces brake light as ""blake light"" and she immediately discriminates against her as being less intelligent because of her accent. The next story evolves with Anthony and Peter, played by Ludicrous and Larenz Tate. As they are walking down the street after leaving a restaurant in an upper class section of L.A., Ludicrous begins to tell how they were discriminated against in the restaurant by a lack of service due to being black and stereotyped as cheap. He then notices how Jean, played by Sandra Bullock, grabs her husband's arm when she sees them assuming because they are black they may rob her, which they actually do by holding them at gunpoint and stealing their car. The navigator is reported stolen and the next story evolves involving Cameron and Christine, played by Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton. They own the same car as Jean and her husband, Brendan Fraser, and are followed by Officers John Ryan and Tom Hansen, played by Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe. John witnesses Christine having sexual relations with her husband and pulls them over and discriminates against them because they are black and uses his badge to physically harass her in front of her husband. Jean also discriminates against the Mexican man that is changing all of their locks after they were robbed. Because the young man wore his pants a little lower than normal and had tattoos, she stereotyped him as being in a gang, and raised the possibility that he could go sell their new house key to his ""homies"" to rob them. After each characters story is laid out, the film begins to twist and creates a relationship amongst all of them. Christine was involved in a near fatal car accident and is saved by Officer John Ryan who has sexually assaulted at a prior pullover. Cameron is almost robbed for his vehicle by Anthony and Peter and refuses to let it happen and fights for his car with Anthony and pulled over by the police. He is let go by Tom Hansen who was the other office at the prior pullover. Peter who gets away when Cameron fought back at the robbery hitchhikes and is given a ride by Tom Hansen which leads to him killing Peter. The relationships evolve and are what makes the film so interesting and keeps the viewer speculating. <br/><br/>Motifs throughout the film are the associations directed at common racial stereotypes with each characters story including black people being associated with crime and being cheap, those from the middle east being associated with thoughts to harm Americans, those speaking English not so well being assumed to be less intelligent, or young males with tattoos and wearing over-sized clothing being involved in a gang. Another technique throughout the film was the lighting. Nearly the entire movie was shot in dim lighting leaving it dark and full of suspense. Overall, fantastic movie, great story plot, and an excellent choice of characters!"

","There haven't been many impressive films of 2005, but this one is beyond exceptional. Moving! Captivating! Engaging! Tear-jerking! Extraordinary! I can give nothing but high marks for this film. It covers a thirty-six hour range of every day individuals of different ethnic backgrounds and day-to-day struggles, who knock in and out of each other's lives. It is an exploration of a roller coaster of emotions involving racial tensions and poverty, (which play a big part in the film and in our society), personal, conflicting inner struggles of what's right and wrong, and the violent actions that lead to consequences. <br/><br/>The story starts with an aftermath of several people who are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, the film goes back thirty-six hour before the crash, revealing the lives of several characters, and the problems each of them encounter during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop (Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard). A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers (Ludacris and Larenz Tate). Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith (Michael Pena) who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner (Shuan Toab) who decides to take matters into his own hands. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways that are surprising and shocking. <br/><br/>All these little plots and many more blend together and kept me interested for the two hours. It made me laugh, cry, and sometimes paralyzed. It is unlike any other movie I have seen. The all-star cast made the film believable, unlike a soap opera which was my original expectation of this film.<br/><br/>The music score was haunting and emotionally driven (very much like Michael Mann's Heat). The script of the movie is brilliant. The movie jumped around a bit, but the editing is done very creatively, not making me confused at all. The cinematography is beautiful. And above all each cast members' performance made the film on a major success! Crash is easily the best film of 2005! Underneath our aggression, wickedness, and sarcasm, we are all human, and no one is higher or better than another whether by race, belief, or class. ***** out of *****"

","'Crash' is definitely a film worth seeing. It combines a gripping plot, a lot of breathtaking cinematography, a though-provoking script and some of the best performances seen in years. Although 'Crash' was not a blockbuster, it received brilliant reviews and won three Oscars and many other awards.<br/><br/>The film 'Crash' tells the story of different inter-related characters, whose relationships to each other are only revealed in the end. The film is set in Los Angeles and the events take place over a period of two days. 'Crash' shifts between a collection of seemingly unconnected short stories and that way keeps the audience guessing what happens next. The drama is set against a racist LAPD and American justice system. I would say the plot was very inventive and absorbing. It also captures many contemporary problems and makes the audience think about the complexity of life. <br/><br/>The main characters were very realistic and the whole cast made a spectacular performance. Particularly well-played was Matt Dillon's character officer John Ryan. This might have been due in part to the superb script. Unlike most of the contemporary films, 'Crash' almost lacked any kind of special effects and therefore made the audience concentrate more on the plot and ulterior motive. <br/><br/>This is a film that you should not miss. 'Crash' is a rare high-quality masterpiece from generally commercialized Hollywood. All in all, 'Crash' has paved a road for the success of profound films."

","I'm not easily touched by movies. But this one is an excellent movies to view during English class or when you want to make a point about society. This movie shows everyone that you shouldn't judge people on how they look or on what they have done. I was especially moved when the Persian man (not Arabic) shot the girl with blanks and the Latino father started to cry and instead of calling the Persian man names he just walked inside with his wife and child and didn't do anything to that man, who was full of anger because he lost his store. After this event the Persian man was so happy because the child didn't had any injury that he thought that she was his guardian angel. I have never seen such a good movie, with a mix of well known actors and new ones but all mix so well together that you even don't notice that some of them don't have that famous face. This movie should have gotten much more Oscars. greetings, Mario"

","'Crash' is one of my top ten movies of all time. I've seen it several times and it still manages to grab hold of my spirit, and leaves me encapsulated with emotion. The ensemble cast deliver exceptional performances, in particular Thandi Newton and Ryan Phillipe, who for me stood out from the rest. The soundtrack is mesmerizing and the directing is flawless, and to top it the entire plot is brilliantly written. Tragic and paradoxical, beautiful and captivating 'Crash' is worthy of its best picture win at the Oscars by all means. It is melodramatic, but has actual depth and conveys an evocative message- that lives are the shapes of cause and effect. This is truly a wonderful film and work of art, which offers the viewer a gaze into some dark hours complemented with moments of hope and regained faith. Deep, people, very deep!

","This was the best film made in the last 5+ years. A good movie keeps you thinking after you have seen it. It has been 2 weeks since I have seen it, and I am still mulling it over in my feeble brain. Yes, it tackles tough issues, but it does not preach. I was left feeling rather empty. The realization that one's prejudices are so far reaching was rather over-whelming, but in a good way. I think that we take our prejudices for granted - that we are supposed to think a certain way. This makes us want to re-assess our judgments and our beliefs. So while one may say it is a depressing movie, I disagree- it is an uplifting movie based in reality"

It's just shocking to see a part of our day-by-day in front of ours eyes, nude and fresh, and realize that the world is what it is because of lack of communication, love and compassion. It show us that small things can change everything and that we all humans are related in a way or another. The plot is fantastic! This is not a movie for entertainment, this is a movie to touch our lives and makes us have a second thought about our valors and how we have been carrying on in this, long and short at the same time, journey.

","Very different to what I expected, pleasantly surprised. Probably more a movie a college sociological student should be reviewing, not me.<br/><br/>""Crash"" intertwines a bunch of stories revolving around people involved, directly or indirectly, in several car crashes over 24hrs in LA. Those involved include cops, gangsters, a TV producer, a politician, an illegal immigrant smuggler and more. We get an insight into their lives and situations and are left with a bunch of questions. Who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys? What is racism? Is prejudice ever acceptable? Like most modern movies, the decision is left to you- the idea of the movie is to get you thinking.<br/><br/>The movie is shot extremely well, written brilliantly and outworked by an excellent cast including Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser (in his best role since ""Encino Man"") and a bunch of newcomers who were outstanding. It was also refreshing in it's lack of falling for predictable scenarios, often even setting you up for it but surprising you. Well worth seeing."

","I'm actually surprised that many gave Crash a negative comment. I have recently seen this film and for me, Crash was a great one. It has well made movie with multiple characters who all play a part in racism,discrimination, and stereotype. Crash informs people about these issues that actually take place today in many different countries. The film also teaches a lesson about being open minded and to understand people regarding their race and ethnicity. It has a sense of drawing one into the film because of the many different emotions it creates as the film goes on, from anger, to sadness, and also relief. What I really enjoyed most about this film is the many surprises it has, you don't know what to expect. Being able to relate to the situations and actually connect to the characters of the film is another factor why I enjoyed and would definitely recommend this film."
"JohnSelf","6","2","6","29 January 2006"," The emperor has no clothes
","Decent enough film, but I do not understand all the adoration being heaped upon it. The acting was good. Scenes were well shot. But the screen play? Maybe my expectations were too high going in to it? You would have to have an IQ in the low 70's to miss the message. Subtle it is not. In fact, everything is SO obvious it's a bit cringe inducing. Racism does exist in America, but it is decidedly more subtle than it was in the 50's and 60's. <br/><br/>This thing is so heavy handed and over the top with everything it made it a bit hard for me to watch. It serves up the complex issue of racism with all the finesse of a ""Brady Bunch"" or ""Leave it to Beaver"" episode - ham fisted morality is shoved down your throat ... and it made me gag. But I suppose it shouldn't be surprising, that in the age where Michael Moore and FOX News attract all kinds of viewers, people lap this up. In an unintended way, it's a sad commentary on American society that something so obvious and shallow has garnered such accolades. <br/><br/>The script sounds like Haggis took a social studies report from his 10 year old daughter, polished it up and turned it into a movie. We get it. People are bad and good (except for Hispanic locksmiths). Haggis should have spent time watching ""Traffic"". The drug problem is equally complex, but Soderbergh didn't deal with it by using cardboard cutout characters and hackneyed dialogue. <br/><br/>If after watching this movie you feel you've gleaned some sort of ""insight"" into racial problems in the US, I suggest you find a shovel, a friend and then proceed to have your friend whack you in the head with that shovel. This movie is a mosaic of caricatures that most anyone could identify by the time they are eight years old."

","Edgy and poignant for 1985, but we've seen this kind of thing too many times now. Pulp Fiction-y dialog and plot thread tie-ins--intentionally too clever and astute, but now with no effect. <br/><br/>Crash's fatal flaw is its lack of imagination, relying on the usual genre gimmicks. Guns = drama. Explosions = high drama. Muted action sequences = breathless drama. Sex = gritty. Racial dialog = tension. Imagination would be not including these elements and still engaging the viewer sensually and emotionally.<br/><br/>This is watchable on the basis of its production and acting qualities, but just barely."

Boy am I glad I seen it.<br/><br/>This movie was Excellent, One of the best movies i'v seen this year. I mean I liked everything about, and the fact that ludicrous was in it, never made me that mad, He seems to have a little potential after staring in a few movies. But thats not the point!! This movie was suspenseful, interesting, And just one of those movies that put me on the edge of my seat. Excepecially the scene where The store clerk went to kill the father, and when the girl jumped in front of the gun right before he fired, and how she never got hurt because at the start of the movie, the clerks daughter bought dummy bullets. I just worked out perfectly, I mean I really thought the daughter was dead, so did her father, and her mother, and the clerk!. Excellent writing there.<br/><br/>I also Like the fact that how at the end everyone seems to start getting over there racism , Casue I mean I seemed that the whole movie was some what based on it. Everyone in the movie was somewhat racist, but at the end, they all see past that , and see's the real person. <br/><br/>I also really liked how the scene where the female, that was earlier abused by the cop was in a accident, and how the cop that got into save her was the white cop that abused her ( felt her up and what not in front of her husband ). At first she wouldn't let him help her get out of the car, but he refused and helped her anyways, and he managed to get her out of the car RIGHT before it exploded, very suspenseful and nail biting say the least. In Conclusion, An excellent Film."

","I must say that I'm a bit surprised by so many people and critics giving this movie such rave reviews. Although it's a good movie it has some major flaws in the script and in it's characters. First of all it's hard to believe that so many coincidental events and meetings ever could occur in such a big city as LA. It's as if the message of the movie (Everyone is a racist and a jerk, but even racists and jerks have good sides and people who seem to be good and who are not prejudice can do terrible things and so on..) was more important than making the movie and it's characters believable. Then I find it a bit annoying with all the comments about race in the movie. Some of the dialog about the race-issue is for me as a swede hard to find believable.<br/><br/>The good thing with the movie is that it's a good story. I did care about the people and wanted to know what would happen with them. The direction is very good and so is the acting.<br/><br/>Not a major disappointment but a small one."

","This movie succeeds, not because of political ends... It's aim is not to say that America is full of racist and hardened people, it's aim is to point to the faults of human nature, and America just happens to be the backdrop. Racism has always existed and always will. The mistake is to focus on that. Racism is really just an excuse that humans use to mistreat each other. It happens in every country, on every continent, and in every society. No matter how much our schools or govt or whatever try to prevent it, it will always exist. There is no such thing as equality. The best we can hope for is just to get along the best we can. As long as each person holds on to humanity, then horrible things won't happen. Unfortunately, many people forgo humanity in favor of selfishness or whatever. This is the first film I've seen that brings it all home. It's not some displaced parable, or false accusation against one particular race or community and it does not try to simplify the issue. Great film, great lesson. A true mirror of society, wherever and whenever it may be."

","Nothing in the several episodes of 'Due South' or the Oscar-Winning 'Million Dollar Baby', just two of his writing credits, prepared me for Crash. At a very basic level it echoes Robert Penn Warren's terrific novel All The King's Men, a thinly disguised portrait of Huey 'Kingfish' Long, whose complex character could be boiled down to 'there's a little bit of good in the worst of us and a little bit of bad in the best'. There are further nods in the direction of Robert Altman who also likes to people a canvas with several diverse characters and slowly allow them to meld so that the good become blurred with the bad and the bad ... well, you get the point. Although I can't exactly toss my hat into the ring with the majority of previous posters I did keep watching to the end and I was unable to fault the performers but there's a nagging feeling deep down that keeps murmuring that somehow we need a little more than this."

","I thought this film was remarkable, another stellar work from Haggis who has, in two movies, become my favorite screenwriter in cinema history, even passing Frank Darabont who did Shawshank and The Green Mile (albeit adaptations from Stephen King).<br/><br/>Haggis' dialog is the best I've ever heard on screen as well. It makes his characters come to life and gives them personalities that are more than just standard, cardboard cut-outs.<br/><br/>Most of the cast is great, and even though there are so many different stories going on, Haggis makes it easy to keep up. The MVP of the whole cast, to me, is the always overlooked Larenz Tate. From his humble beginnings in ""Menace II Society"" to the $5 Wal-Mart bin gem ""Why Do Fools Fall In Love"" chronicling the dismal downward spiral of doo-wop sensation Frankie Lymon, Tate always puts on truthful and well acted performances.<br/><br/>Brenden Fraser was the only really awkward casting as he always looked out of place.<br/><br/>And even though I really despise his music - even Ludicrous did a very good job. And he had a ton of important lines.<br/><br/>I'd give it 4.7 out of 5, just missing because of Fraser and a couple of jump cuts that looked kind of strange. Keep up the good work Mr. Haggis."

","This is a thought-provoking film that makes the viewer consider his or her own prejudices and past behaviors. Naturally, this type of experience will be uncomfortable for some people. Many reviewers here on IMDB have stated that 'Crash' (2004) is heavy handed and manipulative, and, it is probably both of those things. However, it's only a movie - if you don't like it, turn it off. The point of the film was to make us consider society and our relation to other people. In this case, I am willing to accept the writer/director (Paul Haggis) leading us to to a specific emotional place within ourselves.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the cinematography and Los Angeles location shooting, but they could have made a more visually appealing film. Los Angeles is a very visual city, but there were few real landscape shots of the actual city and streets. Haggis dropped the ball on that one.<br/><br/>I'm not deducting points for anything on this film, but I do have one complaint - The actual premise is not revealed until the last 20 minutes of the film, and, it's implausible. There are probably many cities in the world where 20 strangers would find themselves all so interconnected to one another. But, not in Los Angeles. The extreme self-interest, income disparity, and well-segregated neighborhoods make these type of coincidences and connections impossible in that specific town.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good film that won best picture in a weak year of nominees. It's a film everyone should see once, but no one has ever called 'Crash' (2004) their favorite film.<br/><br/>RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"harrylosborne","10","1","2","13 February 2019"," The benchmark for filmmaking
","Crash deservedly earned the Oscar for Best Picture, and it is not hard to see why: the intricate storyline, stellar characters, and complimentary soundtrack allows this film to effectively capture the inherent racism present in society, set across the sprawling backdrop of LA. Rarely can films make you feel as if the scenes depicted have enough realism to them, but Crash bridges the gap between comedy, drama and believable emotion.<br/><br/>Casting in this film is exemplary; Michael Peña and Don Cheadle are the standouts, both giving lifetime performances representing minorities disadvantaged purely by their background. The former is the heart of the film's most emotional storyline, meriting a film in and of itself, a good-natured locksmith stereotyped as a gang member. Cheadle's character is more complex, a person torn between his loyalty to his job and preventing prejudices from altering his perception of others. A special (albeit surprising) mention must be given to Ludacris, a small-time crook who waxes lyrical of the injustices in society, whilst also stealing cars and making his own contentious decisions.<br/><br/>Overall, Crash delivers twists unlike many other films can, and deservedly earns a rating as high as this. Whilst some still maintain other films deserved Best Picture over Crash (its class also featured highly-acclaimed Brokeback Mountain and Capote), to me no other films have hit emotional notes as brilliantly as this."

","During this time of Black History Month, racial injustice and discrimination has been much talked about when reflecting back on the Civil Rights Movement. For 'Crash' on the other hand, this is a movie that didn't focus on one race or ethnicity that was harshly ridiculed or even having to suffer at the hands of others who think they are of a higher class. No, instead it was about how racial tension is still out there even in modern times, especially during the aftermath of September 11th still reverberating heavily on some individuals of other ethnic backgrounds at the time.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast that features Brendan Fraser, Terrance Howard, Michael Pena, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, and Ryan Philippe provided a point of view of how each of their characters' lives crossed paths in daily life of Los Angeles. While having to deal with racial stereotypes in either the workplace or even out on some of LA's derelict streets, it becomes clear they would do anything to persevere in their own lives no matter what the consequences may be.<br/><br/>I found it intriguing that director Paul Haggis (Walker Texas Ranger) wanted us to view the scope of L.A.'s imperfections since he himself stated that one of his inspirations for the movie was a night when he was carjacked in those streets. Upon watching this with a group of colleagues, what I saw in the violence, anger, and hatred; it was all clouded with prejudicial misunderstandings and uncertainty, whether shocking or saddening. When confronted in a harsh scenario, the character would begin to view the context of it differently and thus leading to misconceptions. I was left fascinated that the bigotry and egotistical nature of some of these people were explored in public, when really they can be quite the contrary when in the comfort of their own homes or in the company of family or friends.<br/><br/>I'm aware of the debate and controversy that surrounded the Oscars when this won Best Picture back in 2005, but with its tense situations, I can see why it received its many accolades. It's not at all perfect, nor would I say this is a spectacular movie, but compelling enough for me and my colleagues to discuss the issues with one another.<br/><br/>The moral: While our paths may cross with one another and not all of them may get off to a good start at first (especially involving who we are or what their lives are like), there's a clear thought of what really matters and that depends on how you see it."

It appears the director is trying make a statement but it eludes me and all I can think of is it was written to make people mad. The acting is wooden (other than Cheadle) and the music seems to be used to evoke an emotion or make you think something more important is going on, it isn't. I re-watched part of it with the volume off and was completely unmoved and totally mystified. The sound track should be titled ""music to slit your wrists by"".

I don't like ensemble movies where you get introduced to a bunch of character played by famous actors, but you don't get to know any of them particularly well.<br/><br/>I also don't like stacked-decks, so to speak. Meaning a scenario where every character is some kind of extreme stereotype. Most real people are more complicated than that. You have the angry Persian store owner with almost no background, the earnest Hispanic locksmith who never really speaks about anything, and the young white idealistic cop whom we don't even know. There's more where of that with the others.<br/><br/>I'm also not sure what statement the movie is trying make. Is is that we're all racists, there is a lot of tension in L.A., or life is complicated? I did like the opening statement in narration about crashing as a way of having contact with other humans, in a town where otherwise that's rare. Although I hate narration that comes in at the beginning and then completely disappears. I hate narration period, but this kind is really stupid.<br/><br/>The best part is the interaction between the black couple who play actors. Excellent acting.<br/><br/>Other scenes were forced. Like the interaction between the two black carjackers, and the black cop with his Hispanic partner. I'm so sick of seeing Don Cheadle as the earnest, misunderstood black guy with more soul than everyone else. I think he produced this film.<br/><br/>Vignettes do not make a movie. A movie needs fiber, coherence, and background.<br/><br/>The physical setting of one crash, on a sort of rural-looking road in sight of the downtown skyline was appealing.<br/><br/>I'd recommend avoiding this mess otherwise.

"Tweekums","9","1","2","1 March 2015"," Intertwined LA Stories
","The film opens with a car crash where we know at least one body has been found before jumping back to the previous day. We are then introduced to the large cast of characters whose intertwining but apparently unconnected lives we will observe. They represent a cross section of the Los Angeles population; a black detective, a rich white couple, a successful black couple, an Iranian shopkeeper, a Hispanic locksmith, a racist white cop and his offended partner, a pair of black car thieves and a 'Chinaman' they run over. Normally it wouldn't be necessary to say what race characters are but in this film race, stereotypes and our assumptions about characters are key to the story.<br/><br/>Few of the characters are as good or as bad as they seem; situations driving apparently good people to dangerous or even terrible things while apparently bad people do good or incredibly brave things whether they are finding a form of redemption is for the viewer to decide; perhaps they have, perhaps they just did one good thing. This ambiguity makes the various characters feel quite real. The way we move from one character to another reminded me of Robert Altman's 'Short Cuts'; we never stay too long with any one part of the story before moving on to somebody else. The large cast includes several well-known actors, including Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton but also many who were; all put in fine performances. I liked how the film played with our preconceptions; setting up a character one way then having them do something unexpected. The various stories were gripping with moments of tension, moments of humour, some shocks and an ending that was happier than I'd expected. Overall I found this to be a gripping slice of LA life; just don't expect everything to be resolved by the time the credits roll."

One of the best teachers I've ever had.<br/><br/>But he and I woefully disagree on this movie.<br/><br/>Yeah, I guess you can say it deals with perception. And race. And cosmic coincidence. But it goes about it in the most sensationalized and calculating way possible. Characters just come at each other, blindly wielding epithets because . . . well, they're supposed to, I guess. There's no organic reasoning for it. The situations aren't well-composed, and those contrivances are like red flags; you can see most of these tragic events coming from a mile away. Misfortune arises simply because these people are dicks. There's no sympathy. That's a shame, because this is a good ensemble cast.<br/><br/>The car accident scene is (almost) the worst. Matt Dillon's been a raging prick this entire time, but a sudden burning-car rescue constitutes redemption? It's not like he called Thandie Newton a bad name earlier on, he molested her with police authority. But now, the music swells, he performs a daring feat and it's okay, it's fine. He's just a guy trying to make it in the world. Let's all feel for this guy.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>But the worst scene, when the film sinks to its lowest, is the impenetrable cloak scene. You know the one I'm talking about. Michael Peña's being held at gunpoint and his five year-old daughter runs into harm's way, BLAM! - Peña screams at the heavens, clutching his baby girl . . . but no, she's okay! She was wearing her impenetrable cloak. But wait - no, it's just that the gunman had blanks. This shows you the levels of manipulation that Paul Haggis is ready to reach, and I don't think I've ever seen such a duplicitous scene in cinema. Haggis lets the scene of horror unfold, we know where this is going, cue the emotional music! Nah, everything's okay. No harm done, all is forgiven. All wrapped up with a pretty little bow. And maybe that scene wasn't supposed to be realistic (what other reason could there be?). But then, why would such a trick be pulled in a movie dealing about an effing social crisis? ""Crash"" is a movie that supposedly tackles a hard subject, one that's still pervasive for a great many people, but it doesn't do so with any seriousness. It's just theatrics. Something to make people feel like they just dealt with someone real, and can pat themselves on the back for doing so.<br/><br/>This is disgusting.<br/><br/>1/10"

However, we see enough of them to get a basic snapshot of their character and this is enough to gain our sympathy when something happens to them.<br/><br/>There was this tone that was consistent throughout this film which was established right from the start. This tone had me expecting a really surprising ending or something of that sort and though I did get surprised, I think I was more confused. And though I got what this film was about after thinking about it for awhile, it just feels like it fell short of what it had me expecting.<br/><br/>Or maybe it's because that there are a few characters who I don't know what happens to. The characters are split into two groups, those who redeem themselves and those who cross over and does something we wouldn't suspect of them. We are shown a few examples of both but there are some characters who don't really fit into either categories so it has me wondering what their role in the film was. I understand that this film thrives on the different lives intertwining but I feel that a few less characters would have made it much better.<br/><br/>The song ""In the Deep"" by Bird York (Kathleen York), that is played near the end of the film is a kind of epilogue which fits the story perfectly. This film was really well written, acted and edited.<br/><br/>My final thought is that I don't know if this film is just so brilliant that my brain can't register or whether I'm so confused as to what I just watched. So I'll take it as a confusingly brilliant film. OK wait, I've got the word for this now. It's a heavy drama. There we go. I think I've got a headache from thinking about this too much.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at championangels.wordpress.com"

","What Paul Haggis has achieved with Crash is nothing short of remarkable. The brilliant script and expert direction ties together dozens of seemingly separate characters as they live 36 hours of their lives. One character might happen to be the nurse for another set of characters, and whilst nothing comes of their interaction, it shows us how easily we can be touched by the lives of strangers. <br/><br/>Each character, despite having to share Crash's short run time quite sparsely, is deep, well- developed and the viewers never lose sight of their motivations. Racism is shown not to be a purely vile trait, but motivated by ignorance and our interactions with others. A Persian family are called Arabs, Koreans are called Chinese. African-American Graham Waters tells his mother he's in bed with a white woman, who is in reality Latino. Not only does Crash strip back the violence and hate, but also the small misunderstandings that we have in our own lives.<br/><br/>There are some poor lines that ignorant viewers might think of as Haggis' poor attempt at demonstrating negative behaviour. However, a deeper understanding will show why the characters are acting in this way. William Fichtner's Flanagan swears off black people for failing to be an upstanding members of the community who he could set up as a hero. His line ""f*cking black people"" may shock audience members, but a deeper understanding will prove otherwise.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, especially by some standout performances from Sandra Bullock as a fearfully racist housewife whose xenophobia is reinforced when she is carjacked in her first scene; Terrence Howard as a successful TV director who is forced to direct his black lead into a more stereotypical fashion and gets sick of being pushed around and Thandie Newton in an Oscar-worthy performance as Howard's wife, a black woman mistaken for white and then intimidated by the police for talking back. Michael Pena steals the film in one of the most heartbreaking and emotional scenes I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis' direction is superb, his screenplay is sublime and the editing is so superb that eight interwoven story lines fits into a 2 hour film seamlessly and without leaving any character underdeveloped. <br/><br/>For opponents of Crash, try to put the controversy of the 2005 Oscars out of your head and watch it with an open mind. You might just be surprised."

","People love this movie, and people love to hate this movie. I fall on neither side of the spectrum because this movie was a little too lazy for me to get worked up about.<br/><br/>I was bored to tears seeing this racism theme hit from all angles in predictable clichés. <br/><br/>It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, and it won best picture at the academy awards so automatically you know it's horrible.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis came out against scientology. Bravo! This cat tried to make a movie about racism. Isn't that cute. <br/><br/>Watch Cronenberg's Crash if you want to watch some bold filmmaking, skip this trite dookie"
"theblackscythe","2","1","2","25 June 2014"," This film won best picture? I honestly fail to see how.
","This film baffles me. I cannot understand why the academy bestowed such a high honour to a film as ham-fisted, poorly written and pretentious as this. The academy is by no means flawless in it's decision making, however this is a confusingly ill-judged misstep.<br/><br/>This film opens with meaningless and self important drivel that means nothing in the grand scheme. It serves only to shoehorn the title into an important sounding piece of dialogue. The audience is then victim to around 20 minutes of hammered in rambling concerning racism. This dialogue is painfully obvious and predictable, and the scenes themselves seem determined to reinforce the stereotypes they present rather than debunk them. For example, a scene consisting of a young black man talking about the smaller aspects of racism (fine), and lamenting popular stereotypes (fine). The scene then ends with the man and his brother then mugging a white couple and stealing their car. I fail to see what this scene was meant to convey. <br/><br/>The film then continues to awkwardly defend racist acts, such as an experienced cop who attributes racism to his sick father and negative experience with black criminals. This cop is seen sexually assaulting a black woman and harassing her present husband, however he is redeemed by saving her from a car latter. The film has therefore ended its argument without saying anything of note. Wasting the audiences time. Crash attempts to showcase how numerous ethnicities can be guilty of racist acts themselves, however it fails to do this convincingly. The fact that every character in the film shows racist characteristics kills all sense of reality the film has. I am not racist, my friends are not, and I know few people who are, this is true of many people in our progressive and accepting society . The film however creates a hyper- reality in which everybody is actively prejudiced, and yet presents a story that is meant to be taken as a portrayal of reality. This therefore fails to reflect reality in any way, further weakening the message. <br/><br/>The films acting is serviceable. Don Cheadle is solid and so are a few others, however there are many weak links and flat performances. Fraiser and ""Ludacris"" are the worst offenders here. However the flaccid and moronic script kills some otherwise OK performances, as the characters are made to behave like ultra racist aliens rather than typical LA citizens. <br/><br/>So what is good? The cinematography is very nice, honestly deserves a much better film. And that's about it. I will end this review here, as it is becoming as long winded and irrelevant as the film itself. I will leave you with this: Crash honestly claims that buses have large windows because of racism. If this line was meant to be ironic or something, the film gave me no indication of this and I find it unlikely in context."
"Rickting","2","1","2","24 June 2014"," Is this a joke?
","There are many big questions in the world of cinema. However, the biggest one of them all is not how does Michael Bay/Friedberg and Seltzer/Kristen Stewart/Adam Sandler/every other untalented person who still gets work find work? Not what happened to M Night Shyamalan? Not dos every slightly successful film get a sequel? Not why are they making another Spiderman franchise? Oh no. The biggest one is: How did this manipulative, preachy, patronizing and pretentious mess win best picture? Are you kidding me? Is this some sort of joke? Paul Haggis' directional debut is about a race relations in LA as various characters collide in different story lines. Crash takes an interesting approach: It doesn't take sides and makes us question where our sympathies lie which is a good idea, but sadly it does this with the subtlety of a Fast And Furious set piece. The acting is fantastic, with Sandra Bullock standing out in a more serious role than normal, but aside from that this is the worst best picture winner ever and the most disgustingly overrated movie of all time.<br/><br/>Crash thinks it's deep, meaningful and emotionally powerful. It's not. It is a group of horrible characters being horrible to each other for 2 hours. That's it. Also, are we really meant to believe that these people keep bumping into each other in one of the biggest cities in America? The script is absolutely awful with all of these characters talking in ways no-one in real life talks and worst of all, the film seems to think it's being deep just because it shows the characters being nice at times and cruel at others. The direction is also dreadful, and on a cinematic level this is totally uninteresting. This is pretty much the Zero Dark Thirty of the 2000s: A genuinely abysmal movie which is only liked because it covers an important issue. From the word go the film feels forced and stupid and in the second half the never-ending stream of manipulative moments and bizarre coincidences verge on parody. We don't learn anything from this. Neither do the characters. This is just a manipulative, preachy drama which tells its audience racism is bad- all with the intelligence, depth and sophistication of a Transformers action set piece.

"slduncan79","7","1","2","23 June 2007"," it isn't great, still it is quite good
","""Crash"" isn't the great movie many people make it out to be; it probably doesn't deserve it's spot in the top 250. It's in many ways formulaic, it's manipulative in parts, sentimental in others, and very unsubtle. So the gushing reviews one finds of it are unwarranted. On the other hand the hatchet jobs many critics and would be critics give it are equally if not more unjustified. This isn't a trite little exercise in manipulation and cheap, fake uplift like ""American Beauty"" or ""Life is Beautiful;"" this movie's heart is in the right place and it does have something important to say. Beyond that the way there's much to be said for the way the characters are drawn. With the exception of Brendan Fraser's slimy, one dimensional prosecutor none of the characters are truly good or evil (too bad about Fraser, he's an underrated actor and deserved a bit more to work with); like most human beings they're a complex mix of both. The way the movie plays with our expectations by casting a character as a villain or a hero and then turning those expectations on their head is quite admirable and unsettling, as the fact we sympathize with and even admire such flawed characters forces us to look at aspects of ourselves we might not like too much. And the fact that the people we had pegged as villains often go on to act nobly, makes us see and acknowledge the humanity of people we dislike, which is certainly a good thing for any movie to accomplish (not to be trite, but it's a mark of truly humanist cinema that it humanizes). Still the movie isn't perfect; the situations Haggis uses to engineer these turn arounds in our expectations are far-fetched and more than a bit artificial. Also, while the characters are believable and compellingly drawn, their actions sometimes seem forced and artificial- not in the sense that they act in unbelievable ways, but they act in the ways they do rather too quickly. Haggis also adds to the air of artifice by being just a bit too slick as an author; things are set up just a bit too neatly in a good many cases. Not that artifice is in itself bad, but it shouldn't show itself as such. Finally, the sheer number of characters means that they're not quite as developed as one would like. Still most of ""Crash's"" faults are the result of noble ambitions it doesn't fully achieve, and a flawed movie that aims at something great is a far better thing than a perfectly crafted mediocrity."
"bfreilly","5","1","2","14 April 2006"," A middle of the road attempt
","Before I begin my actual review of this film, let me just get an opinion off my chest about the whole ""Oscar"" thing. I'm probably gonna get flamed at least a little for this, but I think it needs to be said. Ahem.<br/><br/>So what? Crash got the Oscar and surprised all of the fervent Brokeback Mountain fans. Is that the end of the world? Is all life gonna cease on this miserable planets just 'cause it turns out that the Oscar's are *GASP* political? The only people who this should affect in a major way are the people who were actually involved in the making of BM. If you worked on it, then hey, you've got a good reason to complain. Otherwise, I have some advice for everyone else: don't attach your egos to a film. It will not end well for you.<br/><br/>Anyway, about Crash.<br/><br/>I didn't really care for this film. Nope. Almost all of the characters were, in some way, unsympathetic. They're not really fleshed out, which didn't inspire me to care for them in any way. They were just cardboard cutouts of people that were manipulated through each scene. Yeah. Don't care about 'em. The scenes of pathos, like with the racist cop's father, seemed tacked on simply as a way to try and flesh everyone out, like the ""Pat The Dog"" scenes in other movies (you know, when the grizzled hero pats a dog, or tousles the cute kid's hair, to show he's not a total b*st*rd).<br/><br/>The message was a problem for me too. Normally, if a movie can subtly unveil a moral platitude it wants to present, I won't mind. However, if the director prefers to take his message and try to beat me to death with it, I'm going to take my business elsewhere.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Crash may be enjoyable to some people, but it just didn't float my boat. I much more preferred Good Night, and Good Luck. Crash was just sort of... eh. And I stand by that. It is definitely an ""eh"" type of movie. Now shut up about the Oscars and go watch something else,"

","I seem to be waaaay off in the minority on this one, but the film just never grabbed me the way, say, ""Grand Canyon"" did. Same theme, same ensemble style -- but those were PEOPLE in Grand Canyon, each learning something, growing, and developing (or not) -- and we saw ourselves in them. The characters in ""Crash"" are just symbols -- and lame ones at that. The black supervising officer who wimps out when confronted with evidence that one of his officers is racist would never survive in a big city police force. I mean, the guy even STATES that he is wimping out and placing career before principle, and no one whacks him.<br/><br/>I didn't like ""Million Dollar Baby"", either -- again, no relation to reality, and no characters with any real emotional depth -- although I can certainly see the structural skill in both films."

I almost left the theatre but I wait for something happen to become the history credible. Too much coincidences.

"ken-johnson","10","3","12","8 May 2005"," This is an important movie that highlights the effects of the systemic realities of racial and ethnic stereotyping and micro-aggressions.
","Don Cheadle leads an all-star casts of characters who wrestle with the day-to-day realities of racial and ethnic tensions in Los Angeles. Scripted as a series of interwoven vignettes, the movie masterfully captures the nuances of the struggle for identity as a theme that transcends racial and ethnic boundaries. The movie underlines the racial structural problems that are woven into the fabric of American society. Each character is portrayed as both flawed and virtuous. Cheadle's character, an LAPD detective must wrestle with his own identity as he rises in his career often at the expense of those whom he loves. Terrence Dashon Howard (brilliant as usual), plays Cameron, an African-American television executive. Cameron is a classic example of Du Bois' dual consciousness of the black middle class. Sandra Bullock (Jean) finds true friendship outside of her suburban social circles; while Matt Dillon, (Officer Ryan) is both a racist and a hero. Such is the theme of the movie; we are all heroes and villains, good and bad, right and wrong. We live in a tension between possibilities. This is how we must view each other lest we Crash!"
"GMJames","9","3","12","7 May 2005"," You do know what happens when you assume?
","It's been only a few hours after watching an early Friday afternoon showing of ""Crash"" and I'm certain that I will be seeing this movie again. This movie sticks with me.<br/><br/>With writing collaborator Bobby Moresco, co-writer/director Paul Haggis has managed to create a tight, challenging, and very fascinating view of race and bigotry and how people (in this case several residents of Los Angeles) are unable to or unwilling to view people as equals. The dialog is very raw and politically incorrect. When the characters are first introduced, it sounds like many of their censored buttons were turned off. Insult first, regret later.<br/><br/>This format has been done before with varying results. (In my opinion, Robert Altman's ""Nashville"" is one of the best films with numerous characters. As of this posting, I have not seen ""Short Cuts"". I thought Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" was a mixed bag.) I'm interested in how Moresco and Haggis were able to create such complex characters when many of them are on screen for about 15-20 minutes or less? The entire cast gives performances that are worthy of several acting awards. From actors who have been reliable in a number of movies (Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton), to actors who gave their best performances in their careers (Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Terrence Howard). From the actors who make their mark in only a few scenes (Jennifer Esposito, William Fichtner, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza, Bruce Kirby, Beverly Todd, Keith David) to even someone I'd never expected to be than good (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). I'll be disappointed if no one from the cast receives an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>As much as I was impressed by all of the story arcs, what touched me the most was the relationship between the locksmith and his daughter, beautifully played by Michael Pena and Ashlyn Sanchez. The conflict that threatens their lives provides a twist that was life-affirming.<br/><br/>Just like life, ""Crash"" is alternately dramatic and comedic that resonated with me and I'm certain this movie will be talked about for many years. Congrats to everyone involved with the movie.<br/><br/>Update (July 17, 2005):<br/><br/>On watching ""Crash"" for the second time, I was still impressed with the pacing of the movie. I picked up several clues that I did not pick up on in first viewing the movie: the confrontation between the detective (Jennifer Esposito) and the other car crash victim at the beginning of the movie; in the gun shop, Dorri's (Bahar Soomekh) telling glance of the boxes of bullets on the shelf; Sgt. Ryan's (Matt Dillon) confrontation with the HMO employee (Loretta Devine) and her decision to let him speak after security comes into her office; the assistant (Nona Gaye) glancing at the DA (Brendan Fraser) while he was talking to his wife (Sandra Bullock) on the cell phone. With all of the scenes that were in-your-face, it was interesting to see the some of the scenes that might have seem insignificant but said a lot about the characters and their situations. <br/><br/>I'm not surprised at the praise by most published critics. I'm pleasantly surprised that audiences have responded toward the movie. As of this update, ""Crash"" has earned over $50 Million and is ranked 95 on the IMDb's top 250 films. In perspective, ""Crash"" was released in the U.S. the same weekend that ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""House of Wax"". Even with its serious subject matter, ""Crash"" grossed more than both of its weekend movie competitors.<br/><br/>I'm also not surprised at the positive and negative criticism of the film. On reading the reviews and the message boards on IMDb and reading reviews on other web sites, I noticed a number of people are expressing their feelings of a film on the web for the first time. This is not a movie that demands you to feel neutral at the end. Sure, the film is manipulative to shake viewers up. To some who think manipulation in movies is a negative, please explain why horror films are a hit?<br/><br/>Some people believed that there were too many coincidences and that was one major reason why some people were not impressed. I believe the coincidences were there for a reason. Some situations do occur for a reason. Should there be an explanation on why things happen? <br/><br/>I'm still impressed with the movie and I'm looking forward to buying the DVD."
"seaview1","9","3","12","6 May 2005"," Real People Collide in Crash
","Based on his screenplay with Robert Moresco, Paul Haggis makes what is essentially his feature film debut with a thoroughly involving drama of disparate characters in a series of seemingly unrelated events in and around Los Angeles<br/><br/>One evening culminates in a car accident being investigated by police and a grim discovery for one of the detectives. Flashback to the day before as a dozen characters deal with urban survival. A couple of idealistic, black youths carjack an upper class couple who turn out to be the district attorney and his shallow wife. A proud, Persian shop keeper and his wife struggle to keep their business open and safe. A locksmith, who is Hispanic, is also a loving, protective father to his precious five year old daughter. A repressed movie director and his combative wife are pulled over by an aggressive, angry cop and his younger, moral partner. These are people who are haunted by guilt and fear as they strive for some kind of happiness. As events unfold, each set of characters is affected by an apparently random act by another group which has long lasting consequences for all of them.<br/><br/>To detail exactly what happens will spoil a delicate web of plot lines that are mutually supporting one another in almost operatic fashion. Haggis, who adapted the heartbreaking gem, ""Million Dollar Baby"" (and honed his writing skills on many a television series), has devised an intricate, multi-layered morality play on a grand scale. Borrowing liberally from the story structures of his contemporaries like Paul Thomas Anderson (""Magnolia"") and veterans like Robert Altman (""Nashville""), he masters the form with surprising ease and to the audience's edification. He does not dumb down the script but rather treats his audience with intelligence. The dialogue is on occasion wordy and blatant commentary while other times the words carry a bite and sting as they ring true to the human condition. Any edgier dialogue would start to become Tarantino like. Although there are several references to racial intolerance and conflict, these serve as more of a springboard to broader ideas and relationships. <br/><br/>Haggis wisely avoids clichés thus keeping the events and actions fresh and original. When a scene looks like it will end expectedly, something different happens to change its direction in interesting ways. None of the characters is truly good or evil; instead they are full blooded characters who yearn for a better life while tarnished by their current affliction be it economic, physical, or emotional. Just when you think the film will go down a dark path with tragic results, it throws another wrinkle to keep you guessing and pleasantly surprise you. And when tragedy does strike, it happens in an unexpected, ironic way. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle is part of a well cast group of emsemble players, many of whom reduced their payscales to take on what amounted to be supporting work. It doesn't hurt if the script is as strong and well conceived as this one. Cheadle is excellent as the detective who tries to help his mother and his often absent brother. Brandon Fraser and Sandra Bullock play the D.A. and his wife. Terrence Dashon Howard and Thandie Newton play a glamorous Hollywood couple who must confront racial and emotional issues. Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe are the policemen whose portrayals begin on opposite ends of the moral spectrum and wind up switching places. Special mention goes to Michael Pena as the locksmith. <br/><br/>The city scenes are photographed with a gritty realism and the music, predominantly led by New Age composer Mark Isham, lends a dreamlike, aura to the film's mood. All the major story lines are followed through by movie's end with hardly a loose end. It is ironic that the film is reminiscent of a lesser, 1970's made-for television drama, ""Smashup on Interstate 5"".<br/><br/>There are times early in the film that one thinks it will degenerate into a racially charged statement, but it never loses course. The roles both large and small seem more than sketches after awhile. You care about what happens to all of them, even the more criminal elements because they are real people. The film plays like a mosaic or puzzle of fragments and pieces that slowly but satisfyingly come together. Although there are more than a couple of coincidental events and incidents including car accidents that link many of the characters, the improbable happenings are easy to forgive since we are in the hands of a good storyteller. These chance encounters serve as a catalyst or storytelling device to propel the story further. <br/><br/>Crash is an ambitious film with lofty goals that it attains with great frequency. Haggis should be commended for weaving an ambitious tapestry of lives and fate without resorting to easy, simplistic answers."
"John_Truby","Null","2","7","8 January 2010"," Thematically heavy-handed
","Crash is an excellent example of horizontal storytelling, for both what works and what doesn't. Horizontal storytelling is everything happening at the same time. Vertical, or linear, storytelling is what happens next. Horizontal storytelling works primarily by comparison. Vertical storytelling shows the development of one thing, usually a central character.<br/><br/>Horizontal storytelling causes all kinds of problems, which is why it is very rare. First, there's so much cross-cutting between approximately equal events in time that narrative drive stops.<br/><br/>Second, you have to present so many characters that you can't explore any of them in much depth.<br/><br/>Third, you have to rely too much on coincidence to bring characters together and give the story some shape, some vertical development. Otherwise the horizontal spirals out to infinity.<br/><br/>Fourth, you often can't find a way to end the story other than to just stop. When one story event doesn't follow necessarily from another, there is no 'right' final scene, just the last thing that happened in time.<br/><br/>To deal with these problems, the first thing the horizontal storyteller has to do is come up with an organizing principle, an underlying unifier that gives a logic to the unfolding. Writers Paul Haggis and Bobby Moresco use a subject, and this immediately causes problems of its own.<br/><br/>The first problem these writers encounter by using a subject is that the one they choose, racism, is likely to blow up in their face. Any story that tries to talk about racism will appear to many in the audience to be racist. If the strategy is to show characters believing the stereotypes of the various races in order to reverse or upset them, the author may seem to believe the stereotypes himself.<br/><br/>A second problem the writers encounter by using a social subject as their organizing principle is that the story feels heavy-handed from the opening scene. When you are writing an extremely horizontal story, you have to do many more scenes of racial set-up, so the first third at least of the movie is in grave danger of infuriating the audience into giving up.<br/><br/>Crash shows all of these problems of the horizontal form at the beginning. But Haggis and Moresco know how to use the benefits of the form as well. For example, they know that the horizontal story, while running the risk of superficiality, allows them to set up a giant moral accounting system. Each character, with his unique moral flaw, gets his poetic justice through the help of every other character. This is cosmic, Twilight Zone accounting, like Vertigo, but on a much grander scale.<br/><br/>With the thematic heavy-handedness in the beginning of the story, Crash's grand accounting program may feel a bit schematic. The more you push the horizontal, the more you stretch the skin and bones of the organic body to its breaking point, the more you show the contrivance, the mechanism, of the author underneath.<br/><br/>But about a third of the way into this film, the benefits of the horizontal story form start to kick in. Much of the pleasure of the grand accounting comes in the pleasures of the comparisons, of who will show up to give a character his comeuppance. This is the pleasure of the grand story weave. It requires top plotting ability, and these writers have it.<br/><br/>The story weave, in the form of reveals and reversals, is also what saves the film from being too morally top-heavy. Having done the difficult set-up work, the film can run a series of great flips: the car on fire, the little girl, the guy releasing the slaves, etc.<br/><br/>Another benefit of the horizontal form is that you can set the firing pins to go off for all the characters about the same time, so you can give a succession of hard shots to the head and body of the audience. By the end of the film, these shots come with terrific intensity.<br/><br/>There is one more bonus to the horizontal story, and it's a thematic one. This complex social weave is the story equivalent of a Breughel painting, for example, the large canvas of the village in winter where pockets of individuals and groups go about their daily affairs, largely unaware of each other, but as part of a diverse community where the hidden hand of mutual benefit is always working. In Crash, the characters are divided off from one another by their city and their cars. But in the rare moments of connection, these people, each with the same moral blind spot, show their essential humanity.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS please visit www.truby.com"

"TeeKay31","9","2","7","19 April 2009"," Intense drama
","It might be that the way the different stories which are told in this film come together in a seemingly unrealistic way. But somehow, you can direct this critique for almost all episodic films of that kind, like R. Altmans ""Short Cuts"" for example. Yes, it is unlikely that it would coincide that way, but the yardstick might be to watch the film under the ""but what if it does come together"" assumption. How convincing are the situations and characters portrait when things come together that way? Viewed under this premise, I would say that it is an intense, sensible drama with deep emotional twists: the film does evoke empathy. We feel how humiliating it must be first to be molested in front of your husband by a racist police officer and at the following day being rescued (and touched again) by him. We can experience how unsatisfying a life might be which is based on material wealth only, the anger and the paranoia it might evoke...and the loss of real friendship, so that at some rare occasions, the housekeeper is recognized as the best friend one has. We can imagine how it might feel to be a black police officer who is trying to make a political deal for his criminal brother, thereby supporting a system of racial prejudice he wanted to left behind, and nevertheless being accused by his slightly mad mother of being responsible for the death of the same brother in the end. <br/><br/>People who live in LA - which I never did - might feel that the everyday racism we see here is exaggerated and that they were hardly confronted with so many little/big incidents. Again, I'm not sure that this criticism is doing the film justice. I think the message is not ""look how much obvious or hidden racism there is in LA"". Because this film would have worked in many different places with similar characters and similar stories interlocking. I have no problem to transfer the action to Paris in my mind. Or to Hamburg, Moscow, Istanbul or Mexico. Even the people who hide behind glass all the time and who missed to be touched so much that they crash into each other to just feel something are not special to LA, I would say. The thing is: the characters and situations portrayed here are intentional exaggerations of widespread phenomenons in today's world. And because the film is cinematically very artfully done, with the camera work, the spheric music, city lights etc., one very easily gets absorbed by the film from the very minute it starts. Highly recommended!"
"lozwarner","9","2","7","14 April 2008"," Paul Haggis applies a fine cast to challenge many issues and dilemmas successfully, whilst crafting an entertaining viewing.
","'It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.' Don Cheadle sets the scene of the story immediately. Contrary to the connotations of embracement and collision the film title 'Crash' implies, this film explores the sense of touch, specifically the lack of it. This exploration takes place between the intertwining lives of several people living in the intricate network of bustling streets known as L.A. Taking the form of an innocent bystander, the viewer is actively brought into the daily conflictions of characters as they battle through various situations over a 24 hour period. Such extremes are found to the sense that explosions occur whenever they meet; whether that is in the form of a physical crash or something more complex.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis tackles this issue very professionally, as he portrays the racist prejudice that is clearly embedded throughout our society; although he almost overdoes it sometimes, as the film sometimes dangerously borders a state over exaggeration- almost every scene involves racism. Despite this possibility, there is no doubt that Paul Haggis raises, and shrewdly answers, some colossal topics. An ensemble cast delivers a dramatic performance at its very finest, Thandie Newton and Matt Dillon delivering particularly convincing performances- both portray characters with adamant beliefs and stubborn personalities, who end up being brought to humility- the latter obtaining an Oscar nomination. All of the characters feel some isolation from society, and even isolation from themselves, as Paul Haggis challenges some of the common misconceptions about society, through these character's instability, and their inadvertent search for truth about themselves. Memorable moments come thick and fast in the film, as the viewer is subtly bombarded with differing dilemmas; there is no clear plot to this film, although the story revolves around a certain car crash. Policeman and detectives, lawyers and housewives, shopkeepers and locksmiths, people from all walks of lives come crashing together to form a brilliant motion picture sequence. This film may stir dilemmas within the viewer, as inadvertent assumptions about oneself are questioned. Be prepared for a crash!"
"TheUnseenMovieLover","9","2","7","31 March 2008"," A Powerful, Raw and Intelligent Movie
","I am extremely glad that I watched this movie for two reasons. The first reason is that Crash is an extremely clever and complex human drama, which shows an uncompromising portrait of racism and how it can cause either a greater connection or division in a society. All of the characters are flawed and fascinating to observe, as we know that there will be someone almost exactly like them somewhere in the world today.<br/><br/>The second reason is a man called Paul Haggis. If I had avoided this movie, I would never have discovered how brilliant Haggis is at screen-writing. The dialogue in this movie is not only natural and realistic, but also startlingly effective. I was definitely caught off guard by some of the conversations because of the humanity and emotions involved, and even though I am not a huge fan of James Bond, one of the many reasons why I went to see Casino Royale with even a hint of anticipation was that I was immensely confident that Haggis' dialogue would be as superbly written and character-defining as it is in Crash.<br/><br/>Haggis also directs, and he does just as incredibly well at directing as he does at screen-writing. Whilst quite a few people will probably think that there are too many characters in the story, Haggis makes every single one of them thought-provoking, superbly complex and most importantly, human. When two different couples in the movie argue with each other over serious topics (sexual assault, carjacking) that have affected them, they are not quiet or peaceful. They shout, scream, swear and say things that offend each other, and afterwards feel terrible about it and wish it had never happened. These situations happen because they are human-beings, just like us; flawed, imperfect and entitled to mistakes.<br/><br/>Haggis is also aided by a superb cast. In this movie, some of the people who give the best performances are the cast members that you least expect to do just that. One prime example is Sandra Bullock. I watched this movie at the cinema shortly after seeing Miss Congeniality 2 with my little sister, and I despised that film. But Bullock's performance in Crash is a force of nature, and whenever she appears, she manages to steal the movie right from under most of the other actors' noses. However, there are a few performances that manage to rival hers. Matt Dillon does superbly well as a conflicted racist cop, whilst Don Cheadle gives a knock-out performance as a cop investigating the murder of his brother. Even the cast members with smaller roles impress, especially World Trade Center's Michael Pena as a Mexican locksmith.<br/><br/>Due to the unforced impact of its wide variety of characters, perfect performances and both stunning direction and writing from Paul Haggis, Crash is an exceptional, gritty and personal film. It is both devastating in its details of how racism tears apart the human race, and redeeming in the way that it illustrates that the good side of the human nature is able to shine through when utterly necessary. A great piece of intelligent cinema, and highly recommended by me."

","Viewing this in March 2008, in Ireland, for the first time, in the midst of the Obama campaign, after losses in Texas and Ohio,the dominant emotion is despair about the human condition. At best, we might know what is right to do, but the situation constantly throws nastiness, accidents, impulsive action, thoughtlessness, rage, humiliation, annihilation, and beyond anything possible, some dream of a miracle, hallucinated probably, defying the awful hell of de-personalised, stereo-typed, pre-judged attitudes. In many ways, this is strained in its plot coincidences, and repetitive in its thematic structure, slipping towards nihilistic random acts in which character can flip instantly to opposite roles. Whether we live or die, or do the right thing or the worst possible, is a random particle in an ocean of possibilities. Good sound track, but hell of a place to live. I won't be visiting L.A. or the USA anytime soon, but hope Obama wins, though I doubt it, or if anyone will read this."
"crisp_morning_2004","9","2","7","15 August 2006"," Coincidences make the edgy film consistent and dramatic and enable Crash to cover the serious subject ""Racism"" from many facets and levels. It rates A.
","The film ""Crash"" is more like an apocalypse. It might be subtitled as racists' redemption, more actually, human's redemption. Hapless and underestimated as the blacks might are, prejudice and racism exists in every culture, without mentioning in the USA, the melting pot of different cultures. In such a white-dominated society, any other races are vulnerable. According to the law of the jungle, these minorities must work twice harder than their white counterparts to get recognized.<br/><br/>Mistrust comes from misunderstanding, rooted prejudice from thinking in stereotype. Should we lay the blame on the whites for our embarrassing situation? A passage from John William, author of "" Enough"" throws a silver lining. ""Who will tell you that if you want to get a job you have to stay in school and spend more money on education than on disposable consumer goods? who are willing to stand tall and say that any black man who wants to be a success has to speak proper English? Isn't that obvious? It would be a bonus if anyone dared to say to teenagers hungering for authentic black identity that dressing like a convict, whose pants are hanging off his ass because the jail prison guards took away his belt, is not the way to rise up and be a success."" Anthony is very self-conscious about his role as a black thief. He complains that the blacks aren't well treated in cafes and even black waitresses are snobs. He harangues that the whites are oppressors and swears to rob the whites only. He takes a white woman's suspicious glances and wariness as the racism and an insult to him. His anger is obvious. Subconsciously, he tries to change, but goes to the other extreme by robbing, a way he thinks that can demonstrate the African-Americans are not the weak, only to end up in being devalued and embarrassing his own race. It's quite out of date to think oneself a victim and defend negative and dysfunctional behavior.<br/><br/>The race relationships are more labyrinthine than the L.A. streets. There are Koreans, Hispanics apart from Afro-Americans and the locals. They crash into each other. Those collisions are logical steps to an understanding of each other.<br/><br/>People in this film are multi dimensional. The L.A. cop Ryan is a good son. After being rejected by a supervisor of African origin to find a better doctor for his father, he takes it out on a black couple. He pulls over their SUV, humiliates the husband, Cameron, and sexually abuses the wife, Christine. He is a bigoted racist. When it comes to the car accident scene where the director decides to go soft before it gets too downbeat, he takes his life and saves Christine, trapped in an upside-down car. He is a nameless hero.<br/><br/>Coincidences make the edgy film consistent and dramatic and enable Crash to cover the serious subject ""Racism"" from many facets and levels. It rates A."
"ricmalic","8","2","7","22 March 2006"," Good acting, plausible assumption, implausible situations
","Like some others, I did not see this film until it won the best picture award. Having been a Brokeback Mountain partisan myself I wanted to see what all the controversy was about. I rented Crash from the video store,watched it and didn't particularly like it. Then it came to my local theater (post Oscar hype I suppose) and I went to see it again. It certainly gains on a big screen, and I was better able to follow the interweaving story lines. It came up in my estimation.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was uniformly very good, Matt Dillon in particular whose performance was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. Trouble was all the actors were working with characters that, while real, were overdrawn almost to the point of caricature and stereotype--the saintly locksmith, the spinning pol, the ""oreo"" TV producer, and the mother whose ""baby"" is a major felon to name a few.<br/><br/>The film's theme is racism and the unfortunate truth that it is in us all. So far so good. Most people I think are also aware that good and bad exists in all of us. But this film delivered the message with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. It may have been the filmmaker's goal but was not particularly to my taste.<br/><br/>I also found the plot situations somewhat implausible and contrived, particularly the subplot concerning officers Ryan and Hansen. Ryan molests a woman in one scene and rescues her in the next? Hansen witnesses the molestation, later saves the woman's husband from being shot, and subsequently kills another character by mistake? The final scene between the Iranian shopkeeper and the locksmith smacked too much of deus ex machina. And I also left the theater wondering how Officer Hansen was ever going to explain the torching of his car.<br/><br/>Despite all I've said here, I think that if you mute the preaching, suspend belief about some implausible situations, and enjoy the acting that this film is a good one though not a great one. As for its best picture nod, I disagree--I'm still a Brokeback Mountain partisan."

","Some of us can not see past our prejudice, through to the heart of our fellow man. My statement seems trite; but this movie is definitely not trite. For many it will be an eye opener. This movie helps the viewer experience the love in the lives of people of different ethnicity other than ones own. The movie helps us see how complex and insidious prejudice is and how it is profoundly embedded in the nation's character. Perhaps more importantly the movie shows how prejudice can cause deadly harm, harm based on maddening irrationality. Is this irrationality to continue forever? Our we never to get past our nation's shame? Is Los Angeles or is the nation headed for a crash?"
"quinacridone","8","2","7","13 September 2005"," You meet everyone twice in life.
","Crash doesn't present the viewer with an over-reaching story-arc, but is a collection of stories, each a chapter of one person's life. They seem unrelated at first, but over time you realize that an innocuous detail such as a wrong word or a mistaken purchase can have a dramatic outcome. We meet everyone twice in life. We each weave in and out of the lives of strangers, leaving imprints on their souls.<br/><br/>When the eight main characters of Crash meet, the circumstances are always a source of stress: a car crash, a break-in, a hospital visit. The preferred mode of interaction is confrontation and, as high-lighted in this film, the first instinct is to flare up in anger. As the rich, spoiled house-wife (excellently played by Sandra Bullock) exclaims: ""Every morning I wake up and I'm angry. I don't know why."" What I found surprising about this movie is how frankly it illustrates how most of the time this anger is directed at people of another race. Most movies about race relations are bi-polar: whites against blacks, Hispanics against whites, blacks against Hispanics... However, in this movie all ethnic groups are shown to have some prejudice. ""Speak American!"", exclaims the black woman when she is addressed by an Asian. ""I'm not selling a gun to you, Osama,"" grunts the white store-keeper to the Persian customer. Hipanics utter racial slurs just as much as Asians, Blacks, Whites or Persians. It has become a gut-reaction.<br/><br/>Crash doesn't moralize about racism and interpersonal relations, though, and few of the story-lines come to a Hollywood-style resolution. Rather, the movie holds up a mirror. It is a document, not a morality tale. This is what makes it work - you'll have to come to your own conclusions."

It is instant horrible anguish that any man with a small daughter can understand.<br/><br/>It's absolutely the most staggering moment that I've experienced from any film.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is outstanding.

If you think you aren't racist at all, and you think it doesn't affect anyone when you act out in a racist way, then watch this movie and prove yourself wrong. Crash is a movie to see for its morals, ethics, and sheer thought invocation. The only reason I can see as to why I didn't like parts of the movie, the extreme drama and glamour of racism. Racism may not be prominent in society today but it still exists and on some occasions it comes out vividly. Do yourself a favour, see Crash."

It reminded me of Magnolia. Which is my favorite movie. It tackles racism the way a movie should. It shows us the clichés of all the different races. How hurtful and ugly humans can be. The movie also has hope as it shows how characters and situations can change our thoughts and actions towards others.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of musicians taking to the big screen but Ludicrous pulls it off. Matt Dillon is very good as a racist cop. This is Sandra Bullock's best performance, though she has a small role. So don't go out and expect her to be in the bulk of the movie. Her Agent did her well by landing her a role of substance for a change. Don Cheadle is great as always. His partner Jennifer Esposito has her best role as well. Damn she's hot!

It is imperative that we learn to be more tolerant. Black, white, red, yellow and what ever, skin color doesn't make you a bad person, it is the beliefs that makes you do stupid stuff.

","The movie attempts to tackle a deep and profound topic. Surprisingly, it pulls it off. Crash is not merely a movie with a good cast. It is a movie with an amazing plot that happens to have a wonderful cast. Bullock, as always, is amazing. Although her role is small compared to her recent films, she manages to make her performance worth noting.<br/><br/>The lead characters of the movie, however, are Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon. They both deliver amazing performances. Ludicrous surprises the world by showing he is not merely a rapper, but an actor, and a pretty good one at that. Ryan Phillipe is also delivers a great performance. But enough about the acting and more about the movie:<br/><br/>Don Cheadle's character sums up the plot in his first line of the movie, which goes something like: in L.A. people don't really interact, everyone lives their own life without realizing those around them. That is why sometimes we have to crash just so we realize that we are alive.<br/><br/>The movie then travels through a labyrinth of a series of plots that at one point or another all connect to each other. Each character is prejudice in some way or another. One minute you are enraged by a character's words and actions and the next you sympathize with him/her and understand why it is they act the way they do. After realizing that they are partially justified for their prejudism, you are left wondering who's side to take in every argument.<br/><br/>The movie also tackles the idea of fate and free will. Do the characters really have free will or are their actions solely a product of what life has forced them to experience? Most importantly, the movie brings about all these questions and issues without sounding preachy. You do not feel you are being fed some propaganda. You are merely a spectator in an amazing roller coaster ride that does not attempt to answer the big questions. It simply presents them and leaves people to do what most do not want to: think.<br/><br/>And so you leave the theater thinking: is this movie in line for an Oscar? It should be."

","Before seeing this movie I had never heard of Paul Haggis. Now, if he puts his name to a movie as far as I'm concerned they won't need to advertise it. The plot revolves around the lives of separate groups of people living in Los Angeles whose paths cross in part because of car accidents. We start in the present day and the movie takes us back to show us how things came to be. There are many parallels between this movie and Amores Perros. However, unlike Amores Perros where there is no apparent point, Crash examines attitudes towards race and how it affects people's behavior. The characters are as varied as the sub-plots. There are cops and robbers, rich and poor, oppressors and oppressed, ""good"" and ""bad"", men and women from different races and walks of life.<br/><br/>The magic is in the fact that you find yourself judging the characters by what they do in a scene, but as the movie progresses, you find there are no sinners, there are no saints, there are no neat little boxes you can fit people in to. The very act of judging and categorizing denies how just plain complicated life really is. You'll leave this movie feeling good about life and your fellow man.<br/><br/>As someone who lives and works in LA I found the characters very believable. All the actors are wonderful and Sandra Bullock is specially so. This movie made me see her in a different light. A genuinely great actress with a deep side that you would never expect from all the trite trash she has been starring in. More movies like this one please Ms. Bullock.

","""Crash"", Paul Haggis' birth-child, (from ""Million Dollar Baby"" fame) is a brilliantly written and directed masterpiece. This movie centers around around 5 or 6 main characters, and how a car crash brings these seemingly random people together. They each learn ""a lesson"" in the process, and the lesson usually has something to do with racism. This is one of those movies that makes you think, and in a good way. The way it is presented is not forced, or that you HAVE to believe what the writer believes, (A.K.A. Michael Moore movies), but it does it in a non-threatening way. People have compared this to ""Magnolia"", which makes sense, but there's a little more sense of realism in this movie. What also impresses me is the actors. Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, and LUDARCIS are all in this movie, and they aren't actors you'd expect to be in a serious film. But, they are all amazing.

Every scene in the movie made me think, that does happen, we do think like that and the saying ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" made all the sense in the world to me now it's wrong to judge others. I highly recommend this movie. I heard that the first actors selected for the movie, after reading the script did't want to do it.

","I think too many of us are missing the forest for the trees (or are trying to audition for film critic of the year--maybe both). The movie confronted humanity without apologies or excuses, and that was the beauty of it. It was very unhollywood-like and I am very happy it was produced. The technical aspects of the movie should have been secondary to the story. Trying to cover a broad sample of the American backdrop to tell the stories together in a meaningful way is a challenge. I don't think the time-line was intended to be taken literally. It jumped forward and backward as needed to cover the events that were pertinent to the story Haggis wanted to tell. There was no spare time to have casual conversations, long character development and still keep the pace of the story. <br/><br/>It's a set of trade-offs: develop the characters vs. tell a sharp story, spoon-feed vs. let the audience fill in the blanks,etc. You can't have everything in 2 hours or less. Under those constraints I think the technical and stylistic effort was pretty good.<br/><br/>For me personally, as a 30 something, successful, middle class African American man born and raised in southern California, I felt Don Cheadle's and Terrance Howard's characters in my soul. It was the kind of acting, in a major motion picture, from African American men that I have been waiting for for most of my adult life. I had tears in my eyes and the only other movie that I've seen in 20 years that had that kind of effect on me was Pay It Forward (despite the over-exposure and over-acting of that kid Haley Osment). Two movies in 20 Years--Platoon didn't do it, Grand Canyon didn't do it, Ray didn't do it (but it came close), Man on Fire didn't do it. None of the Indie even came close. Maybe it was the first time that I felt the characters. Maybe for some of you other posters this was the first time you had to try to identify with a complex 3 dimensional that didn't look like you or seem to live your life. Me? It stuck to me long after I left the theater. In fact, I took my wife back to see it on Mother's day. I called my Mother and Father on the way to the theater and they were out...at the movie theater watching the movie. They loved it by the way...And they are almost 70.<br/><br/>And oh yeah! Please don't try to tear me down as uninformed (though I am sure you will, judging from some of the other posts)...I have two Master of Science Degrees (Computer Science and Information Security) as does my father (Computer Science and MBA). This is my first movie post, ever. Enjoy!"

","The movie was a beautiful mix of inner city grime with the beauty of the American mosaic. It's the best film put out in years, they might as well bring on 2006 for the awards, because I see nothing to top Crash (even with a film staring Russell Crowe and directed by Ron Howard). The movie was thought provoking leaving viewers in complete aw as the twisted web of events rolled into one striking picture. I would recommend it for anyone, any age, and any nationality. It explores race issues, the hate inside individuals and the outcomes of this rage, gun control, cultural affairs within a city, the relationship between the police and civilians, and many more of todays most crucial concerns. Crash, a thought provoking movie, and a brilliant film."

"PiranianRose","9","3","14","9 May 2005"," Every human being has a story behind the surface
","My beef with film in general is that the media tends to depict minor characters as more or less pre-programmed. I always thought that even the minor characters still have a life of their own, and to have them on the screen for a few seconds is somehow not doing them justice; that is to say, I wished a movie would flesh out the characters more, allowing us to see their complex life past a brief encounter with the ""main"" characters.<br/><br/>Having watched ""Crash,"" I realize it's a real wish-come-true for me. Not that it's the first time a network of events has connected strangers to each other in a film, but it does so well in bringing the characters to life. The story explores racial issues with understanding, not with judgment (this quality is similar to the critically acclaimed ""Do the Right Thing""). The major characters explored range from hypocrites and spoiled brats to misinformed immigrants, none of which ultimately lacks compassion, but they are also not immune from ignorance, selfishness, and making mistakes, which lead to their suffering as well as others' suffering. Characters develop gradually as the plot progresses, reinforcing the VERY IMPORTANT notion that human beings are complex creatures that cannot be understood by first impression. Characters will surprise us as we learn more about them. For example, just when we think we know all about a cop who demonstrates contempt for a minority group (which would probably be the typical one-dimensional character in a less respectable work), we learn that his father was pro-minority and had worked diligently alongside that minority group for 30 years before losing his job due to affirmative action adversely impacting his father, a white male. Do we have the right to condemn this cop for being bitter towards a group who contributed to his father's misfortune? The same cop, with unconditional bravery, later saves a Black woman whom he had sexually harassed before. What was racing through his mind when he put his life aside, racing against time to pull her out of a crashed car that could explode any minute?<br/><br/>This film isn't simply about redemption either; people don't necessarily get rewarded when they achieve something worthwhile (which is sad but realistic). It's trying to tell us HOW different racial groups struggle to fit in the melting pot known as America, and WHY their interactions create barriers with each other. No solution is proposed, as no artist could replace a problem as intense as racial bitterness in a universe surrounded by ignorance and self-interest, and recognizing and reducing these unhealthy qualities is probably the purpose of creating and distributing this film. The only suggestive gesture by the filmmaker is several scenes of slightly stylized lighting and editing to reflect spirituality or enlightenment, a sign that perhaps these qualities can transform people into appreciating diversity.<br/><br/>With the modern world supposedly bringing diverse people closer, ""Crash"" is a gem that depicts racial struggle as an inevitable course, and this inevitability is reinforced by the ending scene of an accident easily resulting in racist name calling, especially when the racist in this scene has been a victim of racism previously. Perhaps the biggest reward for me comes from the fact that there is no main character, and whether locksmith or district attorney of the largest city in the west coast, they are afforded equal characterization. Therefore we have the rare opportunity to look into the lives of passers-by beyond their introduction to understand how they fit in this highly complex melting pot by a network of events--events that may be unpleasant and yet valuable lessons."

","The character development is excellent<br/><br/>ORick Cabot Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) is the white District Attorney of Los Angeles. He and his wife Jean are carjacked by Anthony and Peter, both of whom are black. Subsequently the Brentwood resident tries to save his political career by reassuring voters that he is racially sensitive. His character is never depicted as openly bigoted, making his racial stance ambiguous.<br/><br/>Jean Cabot Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) is Rick's wife, whose racial prejudices escalate after the carjacking. At the end of the film, following an accident in her home, she realizes that the person who is the kindest and most helpful to her is Maria, her Hispanic maid, while her snobby friends are too busy with shallow pursuits to help her out. fficer John Ryan (Matt Dillon) is a bigoted white police officer who physically molests Christine, a woman with African American heritage, under the pretense of searching for a weapon after pulling over her vehicle. This causes his partner, Officer Hansen, to believe his partner has racist tendencies. Meanwhile, Ryan is trying to get help for his father, who possibly suffers from prostate cancer but has been diagnosed with a bladder infection, despite the ineffectiveness of treatment. His anger manifests in prejudice, as is evident when he indicates a racist attitude towards his father's doctor's secretary. His racial prejudices seem to stem from the destructive impact that local affirmative action policies had on his father's business. After Officer Hansen requests solo patrol, Ryan is partnered with a Hispanic-American with whom he seems to get along. Ryan later puts his own life on the line to save Christine, the woman he molested earlier, from certain death in a fiery car wreck. Cameron Thayer Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) is a black television director. He witnesses Officer Ryan molesting his wife and later realizes that the producers of his television show propagate racist stereotypes about black people. In an emotional moment, he fights off Anthony and Peter when they try to steal his car, takes away Anthony's gun, and argues fiercely with armed white police officers. Just when it is very likely that he will be shot to death, Officer Hansen intervenes on his behalf and prevents any outbreak of violence.<br/><br/>Christine Thayer Christine Thayer (Thandie Newton) is Cameron's wife. She is molested by Officer Ryan after she and Cameron are pulled over. She becomes furious with her husband because he does not act to defend her. The two insult each other over their upbringings  as both Cameron and Christine have grown up in more privileged environments than many other African Americans. The next day she is trapped in an overturned car due to a car accident and, by a twist of fate, Officer Ryan is the man who willingly endangers himself to save her life."

","The film certainly deserves a lot of credit for being poignant, direct, and yet very simple. This movie deserved Best Picture because above all else, it was the most thought-provoking, probably correct in philosophy, and necessary to be seen. However, this film was CERTAINLY contrived, and that was its biggest flaw. The events needed to be more tightly woven into the story itself. To say that the film was NOT contrived would be just naive. But yes, a 9 is deserving. If they airlifted this film in multiple languages over certain areas in strife (obviously with access to a DVD player etc.), it would definitely be great for humanity and alter people's beliefs of humans, their motivations, circumstances, etc. Yeah, that sounds ridiculous, but I believe in it."

","This movie is the smartest, wittiest, grittiest, most emotional movie I have ever seen bar none (and as a Film Studies student I've seen a s**tload of movies). The way Paul Haggis has portrayed the characters in this movie rooted deeply into my subconscious and dragged out some skeletons that I had been blind towards for a long, long time. As we go on living we are desensitised to matters such as prejudice and animosity and only through exaggerating and blowing things out of proportion on the scale that 'Crash' does can some of us truly realise the extent of our own generalisations. Sure the film had flaws but if you focus on the big picture, this is an absolute gem.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is amazing and the contrast between the characters is fantastic (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges can act!?!). A roller-coaster ride of emotion, the characters really drive home the seriousness of their situations and pull you into their world of fear, anger, love and hatred (amongst other things) in such a way that you can almost feel guilty yourself.<br/><br/>A contemporary look on society today, not only in Los Angeles but in the entire world, this film is a must-see for anyone and everyone. <br/><br/>P.S. I should point out I have not seen Magnolia. I hear this film is very similar. I'd love to hear other people's viewpoints on this film."

And you can see too much of the script on the screen, there's no truth in what happens: it's all there to prove a point that the filmmakers want to talk about. Pure manicheism, disguised as changes in the way the caracthers view the world: the bad cop turns good in the very hands of the girl he first mistreat; the good cop suddenly kills a black guy, innocent at the moment, because he also has prejudice; the rich woman discovers she has no friends, her best friend is the hispanic woman who works for her.<br/><br/>It's black or white, doesn't have grays, this film, all disguised.<br/><br/>i really consider it a bad movie. four out of ten"

It just simply doesn't fail anywhere.<br/><br/>The film is well paced and highly interesting - showing very versatile people in ways that make them seem completely three dimensional and real - so that the viewer should never fail to see where each character is coming from, why he or she thinks, feels, and behaves as they do and what their motivation is.<br/><br/>The characters themselves, however, frequently fail to truly see themselves or the other person or persons with whom they are interacting.<br/><br/>While racism and preconceived beliefs are at the heart of this story, I think it also has something to say about how the fact common courtesy has fallen by the wayside contributes to the friction in society. Almost every time one of these characters is frustrated in some way, they react with immediate anger, insults, and sometimes violence.<br/><br/>The other problem these characters have, to use an old quote of Strother Martin from Cool Hand Luke: ""What we have here is a failure to communicate."" <br/><br/>If only people could learn from this film how wonderful that would be, but I know that's too much to hope for.<br/><br/>I gave this film 10 stars - and it deserved every one of them."

"jax713","10","2","8","9 February 2006"," Astonishing
","This is a brave and profound film about racism, class division, and the mistrust that comprises a big piece of modern American society. It is a movie that should start completely new conversations about where we are headed in these three areas and how we can improve the journey.<br/><br/>Crash gives us so many ethnic stereotypes without apology that we are forced to acknowledge their sheer honesty. As someone well-known has already said, the reality is that stereotypes exist because they are true. The confounding aspect of stereotyping is that it is one-dimensional. In Crash we see the other underlying textures of human beings and that glimpse of humanity is what moves the story to an enlightening level. There is a rarely seen suggestion that someone who has racist attitudes can also be a decent person and that some minorities do - and some don't - react unreasonably when confronted with a racist jab. There is a depiction of immigrants that runs the gamut from violent to distasteful to wondrous. This refusal to compromise and be politically correct is the cornerstone for the film's heartfelt plea to resolve our differences here in the melting pot that is America. There are also stereotypes of rich and poor and in-between and the frustrations of all of them as they try to grasp some measure of contentment in their lives while dealing with societal and bureaucratic structures.<br/><br/>The theme of mistrust is so thick you can taste it. No one trusts anyone, not husbands & wives, not business partners, not cop partners, not fathers & daughters, not mothers & sons, not between thieves, and least of all between different cultures. However, the movie doesn't merely show us the mistrust, it also shows us why we mistrust. Emotional connections are formed between unlikely characters, some who may never see each other again, which enhances the feeling of hope that is the glinty residue of this film. One of the many stunners of this story is that nearly every character was so wrong about something essential in their lives and this serves, whether consciously or subconsciously, as a jolt for the audience. It shows us big flaws across the board and is an impetus for self-examination. <br/><br/>The casting of the film is pure genius in itself. Haggis avoided paparazzi-grade stars and used a mix of familiar and unfamiliar faces anchored by the powerful talent of Don Cheadle. Each and every actor, from major-to-supporting-to-bit-parts, delivered an amazing performance. How Haggis did this with such a large ensemble boggles the mind and combined with the overall direction, editing, and an engrossing script that is full of surprises, should indeed guarantee an Oscar - not just one, but in all these categories.<br/><br/>Crash is a cinematic milestone and breathtaking to behold. Don't miss it."
"Alxp02","10","2","8","8 February 2006"," Thought-provoking, beautiful, and heartbreaking, ""Crash"" was the best movie of 2005.
","To be honest, I was astounded by this film. It is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my life. I'm not exaggerating. It is that good.<br/><br/>""Crash"" has many characters and huge cast of terrific actors to go along with it. I could compare it to ""Magnolia"" in that contains a number of stories in one movie that all take place in Los Angeles. However, ""Crash"" is infinitely better than the preceding movie because I found myself actually becoming attached to the characters. Usually, the problem with these multi-character plots is that viewers never become entirely connected to the characters. There are just too many to love. However, I don't really know why, but I was immediately drawn into the lives of the people in ""Crash."" I laughed with them, cried with them, and shared in their frustrations.<br/><br/>Director Paul Haggins's film is about racism. These days, it is unbelievably hard to create an original story about that subject. I mean, really, it's a never-ending subject in U.S. history that constantly appears over and over again. I'm not saying that it's unimportant, but many anti-racist movies follow the same plot, emotions, and themes.<br/><br/>""Crash,"" however is overflowing with originality and vigor. I really got the feeling that there was passion going on behind the screen. None of the racial conflicts felt obligatory or exasperated. Haggins and his cast were really searching for something here. They wanted to discover the truth. There is no stereotypical racist pig or victim. No one race is targeted; instead, all of them are, and every person in this film both has prejudices and suffers from them.<br/><br/>The dialogue is real but at the same time expressive. Each of the characters felt like real people, and once again, I became very attached to all of them. From the pessimistic and copious carjacker (played by Ludicrous) to a touching family man first thought to be a gangster, every character in ""Crash"" is unique and touching. They also, at one point or another, embody a part of us and what we believe in or how we feel. It is a real thrill to see their stories all intertwine and react with one another.<br/><br/>Some people say these characters are more like caricatures that do not actually exist in real life. However, one must consider that in every movie, themes and actions are exaggerated in order to get a point across. Are all people in Los Angeles this racist or messed up? I doubt it, but Paul Haggins isn't pointing a finger at anyone. He is merely an observer crawling around in the darkest shadows of people's hearts struggling to find the light. And, at the end, virtually all of the characters do find a better part of themselves in one way or another.<br/><br/>Finally, ""Crash"" is unique because it does not try to persuade you into thinking racism is bad. That is not the theme of the movie. What the film really does is it asks important questions: What makes people racist? Why do they feel that way? Do our prejudices ever help us in situations? These are the questions that ""Crash"" explores.<br/><br/>Do its characters ever find a solution? I will leave that for you to decide. Indeed, I believe that the somewhat bizarre weather occurrence at the end is symbolic of the feelings inside of each character. The snow in L.A. symbolizes the numbing of anger and hate in these characters . Sure, they still have prejudices, but their levels of anger have lowered and a calm front has arrived.<br/><br/>Film critic Roger Ebert called this film the best movie of 2005. I very much agree with him and am happy to have seen this film while it is still in hot debate. Ebert stated that ""Crash"" is actually about the progress of humanity, and at some moments, it looks at how far we have come. Sure, there are still many miles to go, but the many beautiful and reflective moments in this film wonderfully illustrate Ebert's point. Racism may separate us as people, but it is love, compassion, and loyalty that can essentially bring us all together again."
"circlelink","10","2","8","8 January 2006"," A Feminine Movie
","This is a most complex movie. It winds and dines it way into your mind first, then into your heart.<br/><br/>What I saw while you were sleeping was a movie that was far ahead of its time. ""21 Grams"" is a movie of the same genre. The movie does not movie in the predictable pattern of the male energy movies. You know: beginning CLIMAX! end. This movie you will not be looking at and finding any ""bad guy or girl"". It was more like the theatre in the movie - with the fourth wall still in tact. Like mini vingettes I saw life splattered on the big screen (cause they is big now ya'll and loud) - or rather my TV screen) and it was disturbing as it was beautiful. In other words the movie focused on relationships and their forever bumpy ride inside of our very being. It is my firm persuasion that what I saw was a female movie - a movie of relationships.<br/><br/>It was the small microscopic view into people's lives - that fanacinated me. I never saw such raw truth run from story line - to story line. The most intriguing to me was the true statements the Black men made -- which were so true. Many times I have often wondered about why Blacks speak about themselves in such horrible ways - the brainwashing tactics of the old -- take so long to play out. The not so true - but it is OK to say them - slogans and things that came out of that man's mouth was - frightening to say the least -- young black people - listen and learn.<br/><br/>Then the racial tension and the misconceptions of others -- when they do not understand the language. The mistaken hostilities that a sole woman holds in her small body - I starred in wonder at how her anger keeps her so slim and grim. A black man made to witness a most shocking thing and being unable to do anything about it and yet -- behold -- their lives careen again and who is it now - that is sorry? <br/><br/>There are no conincidences in this world. All things run together like a smooth running water. Crash we do into each other all the time and when we are aware of the crashing -- how many of us seek another street to walk down and change the energy? I wonder how many? See this movie -- then -- go walk down another path -- quickly -- we need more new threads in the tapesty of this life we each are a part of."

","I watched this movie yesterday. It's quite worthless. The storyline is absurd, besides being a rip-off from Magnolia, the dialog is crappy, the behavior of the characters is unrealistic. Acting was fine, though. The only character that I was a little interested in, was the racist policeman. He's the only one with enough screen time to actually create a non-flat person.<br/><br/>What annoyed me most was the message of this film. Haggis assumes: -I think that I know who I am but I am wrong. -- What is that supposed to mean. I know perfectly well who I am. Haggis doesn't know me. -Every little issue is related to race.-- Not in The Netherlands it isn't! And, though I've never been to LA, I don't think that's the case anywhere. -Everyone is somewhat of a racist. -- Big deal. I never treat an individual different because of the color of his skin. Few people do. -We should all feel guilty for what a few white people do to a few colored people. -- Well I don't feel like it. Let everyone take their own responsibility.<br/><br/>Of course there's nothing wrong with a message that I don't agree with. But the same point is made over and over again every 5 minutes. Combined with the terrible string music and the commonplaces and the final ""love and peace because it is snowing""-crap it made me want to leave the theater. But hey, I'm a Dutchman and I payed for it, so I endured it. <br/><br/>Everyone who likes to be annoyed should see this movie.<br/><br/>I'm tending towards giving this movie a 1/10, just to compensate for all those who give it 10/10 and call it ""the best movie ever!"". What is wrong with you people, didn't you ever see another movie? Were you on drugs while watching this? But to be honest I'll give it a 4/10, because of the strong acting and nice cinematographics."

I cried, my brother (who is a marine) cried, my husband and daughter cried. We laughed, we screamed, we held our breath in suspense. I viewed people differently after watching this film and I will never be the same because of it. I enjoyed its balanced portrayal of different races. How we are not good or bad, we just simply ""are"". I also marveled at how the vignette approach so intricately documented the impact that each of us have on other people we may have never met.

","I actually saw 'Crash' twice, on successive days. The first time alone, the second time with my wife. It is the type of movie that can get even better the second or third time. Movies this good and this intelligent come along very rarely.<br/><br/>It has an all-star cast, but my favorites were Don Cheadle as the LA police detective who didn't seem to worry quite enough about his younger brother, played by Larentz Tate. And Matt Dillon as the frustrated patrol officer who seemed bigoted beyond redemption. And Terrence Howard as the director who was trying hard to straddle the white/black line.<br/><br/>In the opening Cheadle's character says something about people never touching each other in LA, and they want human contact so badly that they end up crashing into each other. The movie opens with a crash, and ends with a different crash. But to me the movie was about something else. It is about the dual lives most people live, the one where we do what we are expected to do, and the other where we do things under stress which represents who we really. Many times during the movie this is played out as some type of bigotry, against blacks or whites, against Asians or middle easterns. The dialog is frank, and the story seldom leads where you think it will. That's what makes it so interesting.<br/><br/>The whole movie is over about a 24-hour period. During this time most of the characters come into contact with each other in convoluted ways which probably could never happen in real life, but makes an interesting way to show the ironies of life, how the hurter can become the helper, or vice versa.<br/><br/>BIG SPOILERS FOLLOW. Police officer stops a couple, finds nothing wrong, dislikes attitude, humiliates woman with a 'personal' search up her evening dress. Later has to cut the same woman out of an overturned car to save her before it explodes.

Car thieves run over Chinese man, who they dump off at a hospital, later Chinese wife shows up, he tells her to get check from his wallet and cash it quickly, turns out he was smuggling Tiwanese in the back of his van.<br/><br/>March 2013 edit: Just watched it again, I believe it comes across even better now.<br/><br/>July 2015 edit: Just watched it again, I am still amazed what a fine movie this is, every character is written and acted just right."

The movie reminded me quite a lot of Traffic (another great film)..all the characters where portrayed with precise acting. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.<br/><br/>Every story was compelling through the film and i enjoyed all the acting done to keep my attention. Matt Dillon was excellent in his role as the bitter racist cop, but showed his compassion and heroism in true form. Sandra Bullock was also in a different form then we are all used to seeing as the angry housewife and realizing her inner self. Highly appreciated film!"

","Crash has got to be one of the best movies out there. It deals with racism, and subject matter that most movies won't go into these days. It was very real, and I believed that it all actually happened. Near the end, I was doing the ""Hey he knows her."" and ""Ooooh that's his brother."" thing and I enjoy a movie that has loose ends that get tied up at the end of the movie. The way that all of the stories were interconnected was very interesting too. Those expecting lots of action won't get much from Crash, but the movie still has it's fair share of chase scenes/ carjacking/ shooting. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to sit down and enjoy a good movie for a change. I have told all of my friends to go out and rent/buy it."

","Crash is one of those films that you will have to watch more than once. Not because it is complicated in the way that the Usual Suspects or LA Confidential are but because you will miss the minutae.<br/><br/>The film deals with racial prejudice in LA. I cannot believe, from a UK perspective, that it is quite as overt in real life as is portrayed in the film. It blows away the wide held view amongst the liberal-left that racism is only one way: white on black. In the film everyone is racist and abusive to anyone from a different race or skin colour.<br/><br/>Racism is a basic human reaction. Its the dog hates the cat, cat hates the mouse of the human world. You are different from me. Maybe you are a threat to me. You have been given more advantages than I have because of your racial background. Result is I dislike/hate you.<br/><br/>This is the basis of the film which moves quickly although in reality nothing much happens. I was worried that as the film was approaching the climax that the director would give the film a sacharrine ending and everyone would realise the futility of racial prejudice. Thankfully he didn't.<br/><br/>There are no nice guys in this film."
"stensson","8","2","8","18 September 2005"," Touching at any cost
","The main theme is in the beginning. Someone says something about that in L A you are so desperate to get touched, that you're prepared to get destructive about it.<br/><br/>The problem here is race. That's what prevents you from touching. The question is put through many everyday scenes, that turn out to be destructive. You try to come near people, but it ends in catastrophe. But there are also angels, who prevent the evil.<br/><br/>It's a hopeful movie, because it doesn't just put the difficult questions; it answers some of them too. And you can carry these answers with you."
"Rich B","9","2","8","7 September 2005"," Well written and some truly great performances. Hard and uncompromising, real life indeed.
","Mixed reviews on the Internet, big cast, multi-angled story, to me it sounded like a few other movies that have treaded the same ground but still very interesting. The talents of Paul Haggis and the exciting casting of Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, et al, attracted me to this movie and I am thankful that I ignored what the critics have said.<br/><br/>The movie is a group of stories of different people that all connect through each other and all relate in some way. It's a strong story, and quite a controversial one. Large in both it's concept and it's cast. I can guess some of their negative reaction has been due to the uncomfortable feeling the movie has throughout and the very strong nature of its content. It's a difficult journey, but well worth going to see.<br/><br/>From the opening scene you're pretty much guaranteed to be shocked and uncomfortable, I know we were and we weren't expecting the tirade of abuse, one of the more uncomfortable aspects of this scene is that it's from a white man to a Persian, whom he thinks is actually an Iraqi. A very disturbing scene, and something that the movie is all about. The abuse doesn't just stop at the white American on Persian, it moves to Latino against Chinese, Chinese against black, black against black, black against white, white against Chinese, and so on.<br/><br/>It covers how hard it is for people in L.A. (and indeed any city) to actually get close to someone else and understand them. It seems to be much easier to blame problems on others than to actually face up to them, and if this movie is anything to go by, racism is a very common aspect of this culture.<br/><br/>The movie is telling us that if we take some time to get to know the people around us, perhaps make conversation and don't stereotype them, we may just get along a little better. Lives might even be saved. Don't make the mistake that it's all happy though, it isn't. Even those who think they have made the connections already, haven't done so on anything more than a superficial level.<br/><br/>Couple these aspects together and you have one serious movie. Although it is hard to watch and it does make you feel very uncomfortable, it makes you feel something, and that is what cinema is about for me. I left in debate about the movie, both of us, and that's a great thing.<br/><br/>Acting wise I was very surprised. Both Bullock and Brendan Fraser play characters well out of their normal sphere of acting, specifically Bullock and she absolutely excels as the D.A.'s wife who is very much on her own. If you ever thought she was a light actress you should see her performance here, strong with a well written and performed fear and growing racist anger, I can't be vocal about her performance enough. The only sad thing is that it is all too short.<br/><br/>Fraser also acts out of normal character, he plays the D.A. and there's not a hint of comedy in the script, unfortunately there is in his face and actions to camera.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton actually provides a good performance, although yet again she plays a woman with a chip on her shoulder and huge attitude, just like many of her previous characters. Yet she has more range here I felt, and she shows it well. Her frustration, anger and almost all consuming fear is so obvious on screen, and she really does give the performance a great deal.<br/><br/>For me Newton and Dillon gave two great performances, and the interaction between them on the two different scenes give a very powerful message. Not only about the Police force, but also about race relations in general, and shows a common understanding between both characters. This is one of the most powerful relationships in the movie.<br/><br/>However, the strongest pairing and the best acting in this movie for me goes to two non-lead actors. Michael Pena and Bahar Soomekh as the Hispanic locksmith and the Persian local store owner respectively, give the most heartfelt and strong performances in this movie. They, without a doubt, steal the show from the big names and quite rightly so.<br/><br/>There are some poorer aspects to the movie though, I felt a couple of the scenes were presented in quite a contrived manner, and instead of events leading to them being quite explainable or understandable, they felt strained and stretched. A perfect example of how this could be avoided was with the second Newton-Dillon scene, no explanation, no lead up, the event had just happened and the important thing was the story that unfolded before you and the aftermath. That's real life, often things happen and there's not a need to overly explain the lead up.<br/><br/>The ending, although not all good by a long way, reminded me a lot of Magnolia. Not because of anything more than a moment of plot device, but coupled with the same style of storytelling it was enough to knock me out of the movie and make the connection.<br/><br/>Overall the messages are strong, uncompromising and often quite bleak. Do not make a mistake, this is real life and not a nice fluffy bunny tale. Despite some moments that are a little contrived, there are a surprising amount of exceptional performances to be seen and the story gives you a real kick in the head about how we really should be as people. Thoroughly recommended."
"MOscarbradley","9","2","8","21 August 2005"," A remarkable debut
","Like Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" and Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts"", Paul Haggis' remarkable film, (his first as director), tells several stories over a two day period in Los Angeles around Christmas time. Naturally all these stories turn out to have common threads running through them and all these people are in some way intrinsically linked. This is, perhaps, a little bit too schematic, (coincidence piles on coincidence in a fairly predictable fashion), yet Haggis still manages to hold our attention in an iron-clad grip; a couple of these coincidences providing some heart-stopping moments. This speaks volumes of Haggis' abilities as a good dramatist and for a first time director, juggling so many characters and story-lines is both ambitious and commendable, especially when he can pull it off with such aplomb.<br/><br/>The obvious theme of the film is racism and had it been made, say, even five years ago may have concentrated solely on the relationships between blacks and whites and with it's LA setting, may have had a few token Mexicans thrown in. (There is a good joke in the film when Don Cheadle's character automatically assumes the white woman he is having sex with must be Mexican because she is from LA and not totally Causcasian). But post 9/11 Haggis throws in the Iraquai equation, too, not too mention some Chinese characters, (who are, perhaps, used too predictably for comic effect). And if the first half of the film is made up of one racist slur after another, the effect is not wasted. No matter how often we have encountered racism in the cinema in the past we still squirm uncomfortably when Matt Dillon's racist cop sexually assaults Thandie Newton during a search.<br/><br/>But what distinguishes the film is not so much the cumulative, vitriolic effect of the hatred most of the characters seem to display for each other but Haggis' deep affection for these people and his belief in redemption. This is a film of happy endings for all but three of the characters. This may be wishful thinking on Haggis' part but it can also make dramatic sense when handled with the kind of authority that the writer/director shows here. (Though the fact that it's the three nicest characters who suffer the film's unhappy ending is a bit problematic. I wasn't quite sure what Haggis' point was in doing this).<br/><br/>He also displays a remarkable way with actors. The performances are uniformly excellent, particularly from those cast members who are not 'stars' or that well-known. Sandra Bullock is excellent cast against type as something of a bitch, but her part is small while Brendan Fraser's part as her DA husband is smaller still. The really outstanding performances in the film come from Matt Dillon, displaying both an edge and a depth hitherto unhinted at, as the racist cop who saves the life of a black woman he had earlier assaulted, and from Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton as the rich black couple whose falling foul of Dillon's racism early in the film changes both their lives. (Howard has an extraordinary scene late in the film when, falling victim to a carjacker, he finally cracks, leading to one of the film's many moments of almost unbearable tension).<br/><br/>These set-pieces, for that is what they are, may over-egg the film at times but Haggis handles them superbly and the overall effect is deeply moving. The film never achieves the dizzy heights of ""Magnolia"" but then Haggis is still finding his feet. Personally, I feel he has already joined that small group of directors whose next film I await with great anticipation."
"Mattissimplythebest","8","2","8","17 August 2005"," Worthy of an Oscar
","From Paul Haggis' writing comes a stylish, witty, and charming level of dialogue that has something that many other films lack - sincerity. Having recently read an interview with the director I was acutely aware of the subject matter prior to watching, and once you are engaged in the film it is easy to understand how this could have all gone wrong. The key seems to be that this multi character driven narrative (like magnolia) contains characters of real empathy who do not tend towards extremes of reaction as a substitute for action. The style of the piece is also awash with natural lighting and documentary-like filming, which adds to the engagement of the viewer - it comes across like little snippets of reality. It is most definitely a humanistic film, as each stage passes and a little more character is revealed our perceptions of those people change, which in turns questions our own alliances with character in film. The cinematography was satisfactory although there are times that the screening quality is not the highest and in this digital age it may have benefited from being filmed in HD, but these scenes are few and far between and do not detract from the quality of the story. Therefore if you wish to see a film that eloquently weaves race, guns, and politics together with real heart then go see this, it will open your eyes (especially to the idea that Sandra Bullock can occasionally act)."

"hipster17","9","2","8","19 June 2005"," Challenging, abrupt, brilliant
","Last night we saw ""Crash,"" a film written/directed by Paul Haggis that stars Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and a bunch of other household names. It's an intricate story of seven primary character plots woven together through a series of destructive and life-altering events (think: Robert Altman), set against the din of LA nightlife and sprawl (think: ""Collateral""). Using the scene of a car accident from high above on an LA freeway, Haggis thrusts the film's crash metaphor on us from the get-go, and uses his subplots to make a powerful statement about 21st century racism.<br/><br/>Maybe the best thing about Crash isn't its social commentary, but instead the experience of absorbing it. Most movies I've seen about modern bigotry have made their case through purely black and white (think: absolute) characters - halos earnestly hovering about the victims and horns stubbornly fixed atop the perpetrators. And yes, it's usually the white guy conveyed as the brute.<br/><br/>Not the case in Haggis' LA. Each character in Crash exposes something dark about themselves and not one emerges the hero. There isn't really a true-to-form protagonist. Not Cheadle, the LAPD detective or his partner and girlfriend (Jennifer Esposito), not the defiled Thandie Newton or her husband (Terrance Dashon Howard, who delivered a spectacular performance as dressed up, conked, adherent sitcom director), not the feeble Bullock or the hypocritical Ludicrous, and certainly not Dillon. In fact, all are the bad guys along the way. And also the good guys.<br/><br/>And thus the experience of Crash: there are no free rides. Haggis pushes you around the whole time with the ebb and flow of goodness and badness emanating from each character. He destroys any chance of taking sides, and challenges the notion of ""sides"" to begin with. In doing so, he transmogrifies the shell of political correctness that usually governs films on the topic.<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece. Thicken your skin and go see it."

","Let me begin by saying I was hesitant at first to see this flick. I am very glad that I did. This movie is one of the best I have ever seen, it had the ability to invoke strong feelings within me throughout. There were parts when I sat mouth agape with my hand over my mouth! This movie contained various themes including: what goes around comes around, bad things happen to good people (& vice versa), the good & evil within each human, and many more. I have no idea how this was all perfectly encompassed in one movie, but it was well done.<br/><br/>The movie basically displays the fact that everyone is somehow, in someway connected. This is shown through the various, interwoven plot lines of the different characters.<br/><br/>The cast and acting is excellent, with a ton of noticeable faces (I didn't know all of their names).

"samseescinema","8","2","8","19 May 2005"," Crash almost tricks us into thinking it's a great film
","Crash Reviewed by Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com Rating: 3 out of 4 It may sound silly, but Crash almost tricks us into thinking it's a great film. For me, it was good, but certainly not great. You see, it's an ensemble film that has a few great stories out of its many. Like a symphony that has a great violin line, but a mediocre cello. It wows us with one of its elements to cover up the others. And although the others aren't exactly bad, they just aren't up to par with the film's best.<br/><br/>Sporting one of the most impressive casts this year, Crash tells nearly a dozen stories that explore the racial aspect of American society post-9/11. Encompassing all races and the stereotypes that follow them, Crash delves into the reasons racial crimes occur. It doesn't criminalize the acts, but gives them humanity, showing us why they occur and not simply condemning the people who commit them. Problem is, Crash sometimes turns into the film I just described above: an educational film fit for a high school Health class. For many of Crash's stories, Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby) fails to bring the characters past the racial crimes they're story into more of a lesson than an actual story. But for the two or three plot lines that do achieve this, the result is nothing short of an emotional powerhouse.<br/><br/>Part of this problem can be attributed to the film's short running length. With the reel running under two hours, it's simply impossible to flesh out so many characters. One of my favorite ensemble films, Magnolia, was three hours long. But despite the long running length, I felt like I had read deep into each character and could weave each one into the story as a whole. Crash isn't quite long enough to do that. It allows for the development of some characters, but leaves many out to dry with their overly didactic stories. The characters become defined by their acts, not the other way around.<br/><br/>That's not to say Crash is a poor film however. Which is why I say it almost tricks its audience into thinking it's a great film. Except for the script design, every other element of the film is of near-perfect quality. The acting in particular is a high point. I don't have to sing praise for the veterans like Thandie Newton, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, etc because you can already expect their performances to be as good as the script will allow them. The most surprising role, however, came from Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges, the mind behind some of the worst music on the radio today. Ironically, Bridges' (I'm NOT calling him Ludicrous) character is a rightist African American car jacker. He constantly pontificates the flaws of white America and its prolonged discrimination against the black man. In one of the better scenes of the movie (out of pure irony alone) Bridges states his distaste for rap music, commenting on how it's diverged from the roots it began with and deteriorated into material that further incriminates his race. Does this sort of music ring a bell with Ludicrous? I think so.<br/><br/>Crash is the sort of film that becomes a masterpiece because of its ability to stay in our memory. History's shown us that if a film's quotable then it has a longer shelf life. But beyond quotability, can the film really hold itself up? In Crash's respect, it can. We may sometimes wonder if we're being lectured on racism by Hollywood, but then we're pulled deeper into one of the two or three stories that truly takes hold of us. And for those two or three stories, Crash is entirely worth it.<br/><br/>-Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com"
"Chris Knipp","7","2","8","10 May 2005"," Shock corridors
","Screenwriter Paul Haggis' Ameican directorial debut, ""Crash,"" is over-ambitious, but so is Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" and so is Robert Altman's ""Short Cuts,"" two films ""Crash"" resembles in being set in L.A. and in spinning out multiple story lines that it weaves together in a complex and thought-provoking way over the course of a few intense days of screen action.<br/><br/>Haggis's ambition isn't limited to his involving us in a couple dozen characters. It's also seen in the way he tackles the topics of alienation and racism in American cities (or is it just L.A.?).<br/><br/>Where ""Short Cuts"" was based on the quirky, specific short stories of Raymond Carver and ""Magnolia"" goes into rich emotional depth in exploring its main characters (even the shallow ones like Tom Cruise's Frank T.J. Mackey are devastatingly laid bare), Haggis's characters in ""Crash"" tend to be generic and two-dimensional.<br/><br/>The two dimensions do, however, provide the rounding effect of contrast. The characters are both racists and victims of racism and most of them have some other major opposing aspect. The racist Officer Ryan -- Matt Dillon, for once using his Irishness in a blunt, unflattering way -- humiliates and abuses a well-off, accomplished black man and his wife, Cameron and Christine (Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton), but he tenderly cares for his ailing father at night, and later rescues a black woman in mortal danger. Graham (Don Cheadle), the bookend and stage manager of the movie, is quick to spot the racism of others, yet crudely stereotypes his Latina girlfriend. Another character is first pathetically self abasing, then later suicidally aggressive. Ryan's unwilling partner, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe), gets reassigned to avoid the racism, but himself commits an act of racist violence. A young black man with corn rows named Anthony (Ludacris) chatters on perceptively with his pal Peter (Larenz Tate) about how they're stereotyped as ghetto toughs when they really look like UCLA students; but in fact they're car-jackers. And so on. However simplistically, the characters are all given dimensionality through having opposing characteristics. Even the endlessly bitchy wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) of D.A. Rick (Brendan Fraser) who seems without a single redeeming feature finally falls helplessly into the arms of her Latina housekeeper and thereby gains an air of humanity.<br/><br/>None of this has the depth of ""Magnolia"" or the specificity of ""Short Cuts,"" but it has undeniable power. ""Crash"" is relentless in pouring out calamity after calamity and isn't much fun to watch. The racist clashes, the slurs, the name-calling, the hostility are in your face from the first scene, where Graham and his girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are rear-ended on a highway by a car full of Asians and Ria and an Asian lady immediately get out and start yelling epithets at each other.<br/><br/>Oddly, since he seems to be both a peacemaker and a cop, Graham does nothing to mitigate this disaster and merely wanders off to examine a crime or accident scene by the side of the road, which perhaps is what they're there for. From here the movie goes back over the events that led up to this moment.<br/><br/>""Crash's"" stereotypes can be grating, particularly a mean Iranian man with a pathetic little convenience store who is bent on shooting somebody and calls everybody he meets up with a ""cheater."" He isn't any better than the prejudiced (and probably frightened) gun shop owner who calls him ""Osama"" and throws 9/11 in his face, unaware that an Iranian isn't an Arab.<br/><br/>One of the most appealing characters is the Mexican-American repairman Daniel (Michael PeÃ±a) who's called in to fix the Iranian's door. He points out that the new lock won't provide any protection till the whole door is replaced, whereupon the shopkeeper calls him a ""cheater."" The Iranian's mistrust leads to his shop being broken into and trashed and when the insurers won't pay he tries to take out his revenge on the repairman. The resulting shock sequence has been condemned by viewers and critics for being tricky and exploitive. It is, but an earlier scene between Daniel and his little daughter is the movie's sweetest moment and the only time when a resonant metaphor is born.<br/><br/>There are other good things. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton are fine together as the affluent black couple, even if their action seems pushed to the breaking point. Ludicrous and Larenz Tate have a good rhythm as the young, not-really-ghetto carjackers. In fact the black actors are more convincing and rich in their portrayals than the white ones. Maybe that's because they're the ones who know best what racism is all about. You can argue endlessly about whether Haggis's screenplay is too schematic or doctrinaire. He obviously is not the film-making talent Altman and Anderson are. But ""Crash"" is an original, striking piece of work nonetheless. It is provocative and causes extreme reactions, so people tend to say it's a masterpiece or pure junk, but the fact is that it's simply a good, but imperfect movie."

"nogsy11","10","3","15","11 May 2005"," The irony of it all
","Going into this movie I was expecting a good cast performing with a decent storyline but what I got out of this film was so much more. It was a breathtaking emotional roller-coaster with one of the best scripts in a long time. This movie is about a car crash that links a group of strangers together. At first you do not understand what the link all the characters share but by the end you definitely do. The film is very much like Pulp Fiction in the way it jumps around from story to story with it all connecting in the end. While it is no Pulp Fiction it doesn't need to be it is special in it's own way.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon is superb as the sleazy dirt-bag cop with a good heart. You start out hating him in the beginning with his run in with a black couple but later on you learn to love him for his flaws. He is just an ordinary guy who gets a little confused along the way, he is slightly racist and violates as well as humiliates a black women but ends up saving her life after she gets in a car accident. His partner who is played by Ryan Phillippe who was outstanding as the innocent rookie cop, is very shaken up by this and asks to be reassigned. Phillippes character ends up saving the life of the husband of the woman Dillon violated, and that very evening takes the life of a black man thinking that he was pulling out a gun.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle was spectacular as a police detective who is estranged from his family. His mother is a junkie and his brother is the boy that Phillippe ends up killing. He finds his brother dead at a crime scene after being in an accident. When his mother goes in to see the body she blames him for the death of his brother because he wanted nothing to do with them.<br/><br/>Ludicrous turned in a great performance as the down on his luck black kid who thinks the world is against him because he is black. Brendan Fraser was also good in his brief performance as the D.A. of Los Angeles. Terrence Howard was very good as the television director who is being pushed around by everyone and does nothing because he does not want trouble. Michael Pena was great as the Hispanic father who just wants to live a normal life and not be branded as a gang banger.<br/><br/>This movie is all about the crime and hate in the city of L.A. and how it can consume anyone even the most innocent. It is also very ironic how one minute a person can seem like a good or bad person but turn around and be totally different from the label they have been branded with. All in all an excellent film with a cast picked perfectly for the parts."

","Folks, Wow! This one's a keeper! Written and directed by Paul Haggis - he, of ""Million Dollar Baby"" fame - this is film of the angst, desperation, hope, prejudice, and misery that comes with modern life. It is _very_ well written, _very_ well directed, _very_ well acted and it is also a harsh thing to watch. The situations depicted in the film make you squirm as they are so real and so familiar. No one in this film is an unblemished hero yet neither is anyone a beyond the pale villain. The plot twists and character turns keep you guessing and are right on the edge.<br/><br/>The actors chosen were spot on and some were very surprising to see as their current star status would have otherwise dictated larger roles. Yet at the same time none of them seemed placed in those roles out of any cameo or ""walk-on"" effect.<br/><br/>As a white guy who often gets up into LA and who recognizes a lot of the backgrounds shown in this film I can very much relate the type of angst which floats around up there. The various cultures; black, white, Latino, Asian, Arab, etc., do _not_ mix well but, due to the nature of modern urban life, always wind up mixing anyway. While Los Angeles does not come off too well in this film, it could easily be set in almost any modern American city and it is more of a testament about how we live than any damnation of the City of Angels.<br/><br/>This film was very watchable and it does cut right through you. I recommend it highly.<br/><br/>Madoc"
"MichaelMargetis","9","3","16","6 May 2005"," A Beautiful and Richly Layered Character Study from the Screenwriter of 'Million Dollar Baby'
","""We're Losing Touch."" That's one of the very first lines spoken in the new great film by Paul Haggis. It is spoken by Don Cheadle's police detective, Graham, after a head injury resulting from a car crash caused by an overly eccentric Chinese lady. He's babbling all this random stuff, but it's not so random. That line is pretty much the whole basis for 'Crash'. We as a society are losing touch of each other. We don't care about each other anymore, and the day and age of chivalry has died in 2005. When we see someone in need or down on their luck we just turn the other way. We aren't involved with each other and we've become so callous and self-absorbed. We are torn apart the the racism, prejudices and differences of each other, that we almost don't even care anymore. 'Crash' takes that idea and spins a handful of interesting and beautifully layered vignettes that take place in the slums of Los Angeles during the course of two days.<br/><br/>The two days the film is set over follows eight different situations all eventually interlocking with each other. The first situation is about two detectives, Graham (Don Cheadle - Hotel Rwanda) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito) investigating the murder of a could-be dirty cop, and Graham helping his heroin-addicted mother find her hoodlum son. The second situation follows two L.A.P.D. police officers, Ryan (Matt Dillon - Drugstore Cowboy) and Hansen (Ryan Phillippe - The Way of the Gun), Ryan struggling with his dying father while Hansen struggles with having Ryan as a partner. The third situation follows a rich black television producer, Cameron (Terence Howard - Hart's War) and his wife, Christine (Thandie Newton - The Truth About Charlie) who try to keep their marriage together after an upsetting run in with two police officers. The fourth situation follows a wealthy and smug D.A., Rick (Brendan Fraser - The Mummy) and his self-centered pedantic wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock - Miss Congeniality) and how they deal with life and the political hardships that follow Rick after he's assaulted and car-jacked by two black street thugs. The fifth situation follows the two black street thugs/car-jackers, Anthony (Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges - 2 Fast 2 Furious) and Peter (Larenz Tate - Dead Presidents) as they roam the streets of L.A. in the newly stolen SUV. The sixth story follows a lower-class Hispanic locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena - TV's The Shield), who's trying to make ends meet while supporting his wife and daughter. The seventh story follows a Chinese-American couple in the ghettos of L.A., while the eighth story is centered around Islamic citizens, Farhad (Shaun Toub) the owner of a pawnshop and his emergency room doctor daughter, Dorri (Bahar Soomekh) as they try to get through life without being discriminated against. It's a very complex plot, but that's not an insult, it's actually a compliment. These days, it's good to see a film that actually requires you to think and examine life, then some mindless action lackluster of a film starring Britney Spears or Jennifer Lopez. 'Crash' is a unique opportunity to see a though-provoking and heart-wrenching suspense tale that you can learn a lot from.<br/><br/>'Crash' has some wonderful qualities to it. The acting of the film is spectacular with stand-out performances. Sandra Bullock actually turns in a good performance as the nasty housewife (for the very few screen time she has). Don Cheadle is absolutely brilliant in his role as a conflicted L.A.P.D. police detective, following his startling turn in last year's Oscar contender 'Hotel Rwanda'. Matt Dillon turns in one of the best performances of the film, as the bigoted and emotionally scared police officer, and I can't remember Dillon turning in a finer performance since 1989's 'Drugstore Cowboy'. Jennifer Esposito is good as Cheadle's partner, while Brendan Fraser is kind of so-so as the District Attorney of Los Angeles. For me, he wasn't very believable in that role. Terrence Dashon Howard turns in a very powerful performance, while Ludicrous does an actually all-right job with acting (I was a bit skeptical because he is a rapper, not an actor). Thandie Newton was amazing in perhaps the best acting performance of the entire film, and Ryan Phillippe and Larenz Tate played their roles with staunch authenticity and passion for the craft of acting. The newcomer, Michael Pena (who can be seen every Tuesday as the latest cast member of 'The Shield') does a surprisingly fabulous job, along with Shaun Toub. The film also contains bit parts played by Loretta Devine (Boston Public), Keith David (Barbershop), William Fichtner (Black Hawk Down) and most notably Tony Danza in a thirty second part. Paul Haggis does a phenomenal job writing along with directing. Haggis provides a script so rich and elaborate in that it keeps you deeply focused for the entire runtime of the film. His directing is exquisite and impressive, but not too flashy or pretentious. The only real flaws that are present in 'Crash' are that it is somewhat unbelievable or confusing at times. Like I said, you really have to pay close attention to detail while watching the film. It isn't one of those movies where you can take a trip to the restroom in the middle of it, come back, and ask the person sitting next to you, ""What did I miss?"". Because in those few minutes you spent in the bathroom, you most likely missed a plot revelation or new set-up. A lot of people will be turned off with how involving 'Crash' is, but for the few who truly appreciate the art of film, it will be like a dream come true. I enjoyed almost everything the picture had to offer, but I couldn't help but feel the ending was a bit inadequate of what the whole film was seemingly heating up for. In conclusion, I highly recommend 'Crash' even though it's ending was rather disappointing. Grade: A-<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #124"

According to my view it wasn't and there are mainly two reasons for that: 1) It is a theme-oriented movie instead of a story-oriented one (this means that anything can happen in the film as long as it is racism related) 2) There is an ambiguous educational element in abundance...<br/><br/>There is a possibility that cultural differences don't allow me to see the true value of this movie since it is located in L.A. and I leave some thousand miles from that.

At first, I watched ""Brokenback Mountain"", and then a friend give me a advice to take a look on ""Crash"". I didn't get the main idea of ""Brokenback Mountain"", maybe I'm in China, and I'm not a gay, but I didn't have any problems on those things.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a regular story, but it's sophisticated.

Let's say some of them: Scene 1st: the locksmith came home and go over his little girl whether is sleeping, but the girl scared under the bed because she heard a bang like a gun made. So her dad try to comfort her and make a white lie to tell. At last, the little girl came back on her bed. I am touched with conversations between the father and his girl. Scene 2nd: the black director was missing in his car, two boys came closer and with guns. They shouted him to get off the car, their one word ""nigger"" annoyed the director, and they got a fight. When they are fighting, the polices found them and chased them for a moment. Finally, the director try to prove his bold (even we called his ""dignity"") because his wife was humiliated by a white police. At that urgent moment, another white police who has met him before explained and ended a coming fire battle. I was touched by their conversations, and a kind of complex mood in the black director. Scene 3rd: the black officer found his brother's dead, his mom knew it as well. At hospital, they had a difficult talk, a sad mother blamed a busy son, I was touched by their words. Scene 4th: near the end, the young black has save a lot of Asians, and then he backed the car, he appeared a slight smile, I was touched by his smile.<br/><br/>In the fact, this movie has brought more scenes like this, I hope my review can drive you to watch.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading."

I came away from this film thinking two things: 1) that we as human beings are all racists in some way or form no matter if we admit it or not. 2) Art imitates life and vice versa. I am not disputing the fact that this is an excellent piece of work by Director Paul Haggis, it's just that I was not prepared for the harrowing saga that is the movie Crash. It does not pretend, it doesn't not solve anything, it does not point fingers, you look at it and you can see yourself in it, no matter what age, race, religion you are, unless you're a new born baby. It is an American film, or at least most identifiably American. The values in this film are those that we have been taught, and those that we have grabbed and assimilated along the way. The saddest part of this film, to me is that it seems to be saying that we as human beings and citizens of this earth concern ourselves mostly with the trivial things in life, and that in itself is our own downfall."

You need to pay close attention since it jumps from place to place. In the end the parts all weave together a tapestry that is LA, but can probably be a true representation of any mid to large city in the US. The cast all give marvelous performances, but this is a movie whose message comes so many many story lines that no one actor has much screen time. So if you plan to see this film for a particular actor be prepared for that individual to be on screen for a limited amount of time. It should be required viewing for all High School seniors in the US. (I had my 2 daughters in high school, a junior and a sophomore, watch it.) There are many scenes with high tension when the language earns the R rating along with one scene with sexual foreplay that shows a breast as well as a scene that shows the effects of drugs. These scenes are all integral to the movie and paint a gritty and honest portrait of life. Paul Haggis has made a masterpiece.

"dvejr","9","2","9","22 January 2006"," What Bothered Me
","I really liked this movie, warts and all. I really did. Yes, it is a series of short scenes in which the characters are more charcoal sketch than oil portrait. Yes, it is too neat that most of the characters act poorly once, then not once. The NYTimes critic (who thoroughly panned the movie) said something about ""showing us everyone is complex by showing us lots of characters with exactly two sides."" I get it.<br/><br/>The first thing that bothered me happened right away - the opening ""LA is a lonely place"" crap. I think LA cares about itself a lot more than I do. It would have worked a little better as a closing monologue, but I would have gotten the point all by myself anyway, and aren't the truths the writers wanted us to see universal?<br/><br/>SPOILER - The second thing that bothered me - really REALLY bothered me, was that after one character loses control, grabs a pistol, tracks down his perceived antagonist and shoots at him, no one in the assaulted family calls the police. Sorry, Mr. Editor, the scene where the cops arrest the assailant needed to be in the film.<br/><br/>I LOVED the patter between the two young black men as they emerged from the restaurant. The bit about the bad service and the tip, the bit about who on the sidewalk was, or ought to be, afraid of whom, and then the wonderful ""punch line"" when the car jacking occurs. Loved it.<br/><br/>I liked that neither Brendan Frazer nor Sandra Bullock were even a little bit cute for even a second. Two selfish creeps!<br/><br/>I liked that the one schlub we thought was a totally innocent victim was revealed, after he was hospitalized, to be part of something transcendentally evil.<br/><br/>Great movie."

Paul gives us a moment...to reflect on our fears, hopes and struggles to make it in this World full of people who look, think and act differently...or so we think.<br/><br/>This film is in a class of its own as forces you to face the truth about yourself and your fellow human beings.

It shows how any person can get over personal prejudices and become a hero.<br/><br/>Crash has a masterful plot that is like a puzzle; by the end of the movie, the audience sees how every character is connected and in the end, it proves that every member of the human race is connected even though we often forget it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Crash deserves the Oscar for Best Picture."
"jonasdijkstra","8","2","9","22 December 2005"," The critics prove the movies point
","I absolutely loved this film, but I cannot believe the huge amount of criticism it's been receiving lately. When I look at the recent reviews here on IMDb a lot of the negative ones state that in this movies the dialogues are contrived, the events are unbelievable and even that the people are offensive in their racism.<br/><br/>Off course the dialogue is contrived, as well as that the situations have to be ""out of the ordinary."" It's the only way to provoke a reaction, thus in the end enabling the characters to redeem themselves. If Haggis would've sticked to realism and every day dialogue, how would he have been able to make a thought provoking movie about, not people being racists, but human nature and how it's influenced by our surroundings. Which brings me to the topic of racism. It's not a movie about racism IMO, racism is just a necessary emotional conduit to make it possible for such a wide variety of characters in a diverse place as L.A. to react to one another. The alternative would have been 2 or 3 people displaying a variety of emotions, he chose this way because it's such a powerful one and, although people here apparently disagree, still a really common one.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that by showing your criticism in the way that you are, by reacting emotionally to this movie, (almost every critic gave this movie 1 or 2 *s, which is preposterous,) you are in fact doing the exact same thing that the characters in the movie are doing, not acting logical and contriving things to make a point. I think the director has it spot on when it comes to character development and the human reaction<br/><br/>In my opinion this was a brilliant movie, though in the beginning the personal views were pretty forced, but I expect great things to come if Haggis keeps making films."
"asfm218","4","2","9","26 October 2005"," Not bad
","This movie did portray a good deal of miscommunication, stereotyped beliefs, etc. The modernized racism is shown, rather than the usual one-sided tales. However, the one thing that made me cringe (more than a few times) were the roles of the Asians. Of course being that I'm Asian-American, I cared to notice. There is no denial of illegal immigration and how our older generations tend to speak quite loudly and rudely for that matter. But we're seen as weak, easy to pick on, and unable to speak English without the heavy accent. First, it's the unreasonable Asian woman, then it's the poor guy who gets run over (and saving his life is only based upon not being want for murder,) and later, ""Ludacris"" becomes the hero in saving and releasing the immigrants? Illegal immigration happens in ALL countries. When I'm taking public transportation: ALL nationalities speak louder than they should and disturb the peace in other means (blasting the eardrums with music) etc. Lol, OK. Well, my apologies if I'm getting off-track. But it's frustrating when so many African-Americans in the US at least, and Spanish-Americans claim how they're being treated w/o equality when do the same to Asians. We're thought of as the ""geeks,"" people intimidated easily, rich (oh, that's a good one. I know too many Asians who live in our own ""projects"" not funded by the government, but no, we're known to have money,) timid, etc, etc, etc. Oh, and a coworker once said to me ""You listen to R&B? You know who Tupac is? Omg. You listen to Hip-Hop? You dance to reggae?"" Another one says ""You wouldn't understand my hardship. I'm from Harlem."" What can I say? That I grew up with roaches as my best friends? Third one says ""You know about drugs? You ""people"" actually have murders go on? How come I never see it on the news?

With its glaring overuse of racial and psychological stereotypes it was obvious and trite. You can even see the plot ""twists"" coming a mile away, destroying any little bit of tension the movie could have had. I absolutely hated it.

"Chris_Docker","9","2","9","12 August 2005"," Oscar bait with broad appeal - yet a remarkably thought-provoking film and one of the most interesting portraits of L.A. to date
","Writing, directing and producing Crash, even through a heart attack, suggests that Paul Haggis is perhaps a remarkable individual, though not necessarily remarkable at any or all three. The result, however, suggests that he is. Crash is remarkable and noteworthy for a number of reasons, and could repeat some of the success of Million Dollar Baby (which he wrote and produced although, perhaps unfortunately in the opinion of this reviewer, allowed Eastwood to direct).<br/><br/>The start of the movie shows the scene immediately after a car crash. A number of people start arguing, racist remarks are made. It is set in L.A. - a challenging city in many ways, not least for its complex racial mix.<br/><br/>Crash goes on to look beneath the surface of such destructive attitudes by examining a number of incidents the day before the crash in question. In doing so it achieves not only challenging self-reflection but maintains the dramatic pace in a way that many such movies fail to accomplish.<br/><br/>In many ways, American society (ie US society) has got itself into problems that are nigh impossible to fix (and often not for want of trying). With race relations, Haggis looks at deeply embedded attitudes and failings that are not only common to many ethnic groups (including white American) but where people are in a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" situation.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock (in a relatively small part but one of the best she has tackled) has relatively few pressures in her life. She is married to a D.A., has a housekeeper and a gardener, but finds she is waking up angry every day. An intelligent individual, she goes as far as seeing it is something within herself rather than just blaming everyone else. Her questioning goes further when she has a small accident (that lands her in hospital) and her 'best friend' is having a massage and hence too busy to help.<br/><br/>Earlier in the film, Bullock asks herself: if she sees a black man in a white neighbourhood and (instinctively) knows that he means to harm her, she will be dubbed 'racist' if she takes steps to protect herself yet come to harm if she ignores her well-seated gut feeling. (Her gut feelings are not always right, but how often do you want to gamble when it's your life at stake?)<br/><br/>We see similar dilemmas (also often over-exaggerated, misconstrued, or interpreted with tragic lack of streetwise, from the point of view of Blacks, Hispanics, Chinese and Iraqis).<br/><br/>The subplots of various characters keep us glued to the screen; any simple value-judgements are confounded. We see the love and (sometimes counter-stereotypical) bravery of the most 'unlovable, 'racist' characters. We see the real people behind what others (ie others of different ethnic origins) see. We question the obvious 'answers'.<br/><br/>The USA is imbued with ideologies that, whilst survivalist, are not self-healing (transferring the government of, say, New Zealand for 25 years might help). Traditional Christian virtues alone are insufficient to deal with such problems (the 'Good Samaritan cop not only gets himself in deep water but ends up doing more harm than good.) But so is populist psycho-savvy: "" . . . if we can't duck this thing, we're gonna have to neutralize it."" (D.A. faced with a politically problematic prosecution of a black man who's given him problems.) ""What we need is a picture of me pinning a medal on a black man. The fire-fighter - the one that saved the camp or something - Northridge... what's his name?"" It didn't matter that the hero was an Iraqi - but it mattered that he happened to have the common first name of 'Saddam' - no good for P.R. that one . . .<br/><br/>The principled approach of Don Cheadle's character has similarly little effect. He tries to be an upright Detective in a politically corrupt system and so gets caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. There are very few winners in Crash.<br/><br/>Yet the overall formula is a winner. It lacks answers, just as America probably lacks the ability to use applied philosophy to solve problems in its own back yard - at least in the foreseeable future on this issue. But it's integrity as art, its ability to move us - to laughter, to tears, to compassion, to shock - to enable us to look within ourselves, that integrity and independence of thought is quite strong and all the more remarkable for an American movie these days. It even lacks the self-congratulatory tone of Million Dollar Baby (which may be invisible to many Americans, especially those not extensively exposed to European and other cinema that is more art-based than big-business based). If you've had six pints of lager and want lots of explosions, Crash may not rock your boat but, for mainstream quality cinema-lovers, it is a breath of fresh air."

","Paul Haggis seems to have just popped up all of the sudden, first with ""Million Dollar Baby"" and now with ""Crash"" which goes way beyond entertainment and offers some of the most interesting, compelling and realistic character's ever created.<br/><br/>The story follows several different people in LA, all with different job, different social status, different dreams, different beliefs. Yet haggis was able to fine commonality in diversity and masterfully allowed these character's lives to collied in the course of only a couple of days.<br/><br/>The character development in this film is better than pretty much any film I've ever seen. Most films try to create an allegory, or if not that they simply conform to formulaic design. They create character's that can do no wrong or can do no good. In this film all of the character's are shown as having a capacity for both, just as humanity has its flaws and virtues in reality as do the fictional character's created by Haggis. There are times when the man that is made to look like the good guy does something completely unforgivable and the schmuck does something completely selfless and noble. Speaking from experience, it is very hard to create this kind depth in any fictional being, its even harder to do it when you have that many principal character's.<br/><br/>The dialog was very interesting and smart. I can imagine it would be very difficult to create the variation that was included in this film. He used several different vernacular's for the different character's based on there social status, level of education, occupation, etc. It is so realistic that it allows you to be drawn in from the very beginning and held to the end.<br/><br/>I found the cinematography interesting. It isn't on the same level as John Mathison or Matthew Labique but it was still good to look at. It reminded me a little of the look of Steven Soderburg's ""Traffic"" minus the variation of color tints. It was a sort of grainy image which gave the film an interesting effect, very dark and gritty. I felt it fit the subject matter perfectly.<br/><br/>I was absolutely amazed to find out that this film was shot on only seven million dollars. What Haggis was able to do with the minuscule budget that definitely would have inhibited them in regards on-location shooting, scheduling and other things. This film is proof that the bigger budget doesn't mean the better film.<br/><br/>This is definitely recommended. It is a beautiful film. Completely original and unique. This is truly one of a kind. Don't miss it."

","Will Crash get people to change their attitudes towards others? Doubtful, but it certainly makes you realize that our attitudes are often based on circumstances and few of us are perfect...or all-bad for that matter.<br/><br/>I'm reminded of a line by Andy Garcia's John Bubber in Hero. He said, ""We're all heroes, if you catch us at the right moment."" Too expand upon it, ""We all make tragic mistakes and judgments"" when you catch us at the wrong moment.<br/><br/>In Crash, these moments are captured for a racially and economically diverse array of characters over a 48 hour period. We see people shine and we see them brought low. None of the characters are exempt from their darker side, save a locksmith and his little girl. What makes them special? Could it be a faith in God that keeps them both physically and spiritually safe? This is just one of the questions that Crash presents us with to ponder.<br/><br/>The multi-scenario plot works well. Not since Pulp Fiction have I been so simultaneously upset at having the camera leave one story and overjoyed at having it return to another one with whose characters I have become so deeply involved with in a short period of time.<br/><br/>Director Haggis' first time effort is skillful and captivating. The cast contains several top-name stars who are well complemented by a group of lesser known performers, all who dig deep to deliver multi-layered performances.<br/><br/>Some have decried the amount of coincidences that bring the many characters together.

"TaniaDudina","8","2","9","16 May 2005"," Crash - A Movement (Not Just a Movie)
","Modern movies are often criticized for allegedly depriving their audiences of the ability to think abstractly and providing shallow entertainment in the form of colorful moving pictures. Fortunately, writer and director Paul Haggis, has come a long way in redeeming the reputation of modern cinema, and perhaps even humanity as a whole, in his most recently released film, Crash.<br/><br/>To provide a most basic synopsis, Crash is a compilation of the stories of various individuals, whose lives, in one way or another, collide and become irreversibly intermingled. In all cases, the major distinguishing factor between these people is their race and ethnicity. From the very opening of the film, stereotypes and prejudices that are kept locked in our minds or else inserted into the kind of jokes that are only told in a dark whisper, are blatantly exposed.<br/><br/>It is one thing to simply reject certain stereotypes, but it is an altogether different, braver and more honest thing to admit their existence. Unlike many other films and forms of artwork that focus on pointing out the fallacies in common stereotypes, Crash accepts that many stereotypes are not groundless. The two dangerous looking black men whom we meet in the beginning of the movie really do pull out guns and rob a car, and the rich white couple that is instantly pegged as being snobby and racist, really does live up to our cynical expectations. Although many of the film's stories also attempt to show how misleading a stereotype can be, its most powerful and moving moments were those that explained the mind set of the people who fit so neatly into our society's clichÃ©s. The movie attempts to answer questions such as ""How did we become this way?"" and most importantly ""What can we do to change?"" Thought-provoking, heart-twisting messages aside, Crash also succeeds in keeping the audience thoroughly entertained. It is the kind of film that is best watched with a large audience because the chorus of gasps and shrieks that accompany many a scene provide a very intense experience. Although the characters are not entirely fleshed-out, since we keep jumping from story to story, we eventually (if not instantly) empathize with all of them, and experience each violently powerful emotion. The only major flaw that Haggis's film is at times guilty of is having monologues that sound a bit too much like soliloquies and dialogue that sounds too much like the morals that come at the end of a fable. Though most of the dialogue had a very realistic tone, and each character was a distinct individual, there were some points in the movie in which the character's voices became muffled by the voice of the author. Haggis was able to perfectly show rather than tell the moral of his story, and yet he chose to tell it explicitly some more even after we knew exactly what he was saying. Nonetheless, this slight break from authenticity by no means destroyed the overall strength of Crash. Perhaps it was worth it to sacrifice a purely realistic tone for a hard-hitting film that left a lasting impression on its audience.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that the audience, just as the cast of the movie, was extremely diverse, but the reactions of the audience members were very similar. Each one of us was able to relate to the story on some level, and sitting side by side, realizing that we were all feeling very close to the same thing, was yet another deeply stirring aspect of the entire experience. For all of the reasons mentioned above, I recommend that you see this movie. For the reason mentioned here last, I urge you to go see Crash while it is still playing in theaters."

","In Paul Haggis' powerful, yet artificial film, CRASH, characters who are introduced as being ""bad"" eventually do something good to let us know that they are all really quite human. And people who we are introduced to us as being ""good"" invariably do something bad, so that, well, we know that they are really quite human too. There is a logic to that, both from a literary and a humanistic point of view, but one gets the idea that Haggis wrote the screenplay with a scorecard at hand to make everything balance out just right. No one is too racist, no one is too mean, and certainly no one is too nice. And nobody in the audience will get too offended.<br/><br/>CRASH is part of what is becoming a film sub-genre, the L.A. City of Strangers soap opera. Like its predecessors, Lawrence Kasdan's GRAND CANYON, Robert Altman's SHORT CUTS and Paul Thomas Anderson's MAGNOLIA, the film jumbles together an odd cross section of Los Angelenos whose lives crisscross and connect, some only by the finest of threads. These films advance the same thesis: that the City of (Fallen) Angels is a cold, uninviting city where people touch each other only by chance; their superficial lives become interconnected, but almost against everybody's will. These films are less cohesive epics than randomly juggled short stories. Indeed, that is what Altman's SHORT CUTS is, a collection of unrelated Raymond Carver short stories forcibly spliced into a single bleak reality.<br/><br/>Like the more upbeat GRAND CANYON, CRASH uses race as a catalyst for drama, but unlike Kasdan's film, there are precious few inklings of optimism. The film's observation that everyone is at least a little bit racist is delivered with little subtlety; they all wear their bigotry on their sleeves. One is reminded of a scene in Spike Lee's JUNGLE FEVER where a waitress expresses her disapproval of an interracial couple with a loud and embarrassingly inappropriate tirade in the middle of the crowded restaurant. Haggis, like Lee, sees racism as being far more blatant then it really is and over vocalizes his characters' beliefs. Sometimes a roll of the eyes or a facial expression says more than a long-winded rant -- but, of course, that isn't nearly as dramatic. Some of the scenes in CRASH seem to have been written in all-caps, boldface, underlined and punctuated with multiple exclamation points. Used sparingly, such heightened drama can jar the viewer; used repeatedly it only rings uncomfortably false.<br/><br/>Apparently, the goal of the film is to debunk racist stereotypes, but to do so the film first presents those stereotypes as a given. Unlike, say MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON, another film with pointedly multi-ethnic casting, CRASH doesn't ignore racial stereotypes, it presents them and then tries to defy them in a way that only ends up confirming them. Once established, the overt stereotypes linger: It is a politically correct backhanded sort of racism to define characters solely by their race or ethnicity or gender and then pretend that it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>Haggis' background is in episodic TV (""thirtysomething,"" ""L.A. Law,"" etc.) and it shows. CRASH is meted out in little bite-sized vignettes as it focuses on a group whose lives keep intertwining in an unrealistic, melodramatic way. In soap opera fashion, his mosaic of seemingly random occurrences all come together with far too many clumsy coincidences designed to stun us with unexpected irony. The effect is sometimes remarkably poignant, yet, when all the stories build to ironic twists, that irony becomes ineffective, diluted by its own calculated obviousness. The film ends with most of the stories unresolved, supposedly suggesting an attempt to mirror reality, yet even the messiness of its non-conclusion seems just too neatly contrived. One expects it to fade to black as the announcer invites us to stay tuned for scenes from next week's episode. It is a comfortable and not particularly daring way to tell a story.<br/><br/>Yet, the film has an undeniable power to it. The actors manage to give intense and not always flattering performances that risk but never achieve caricature; no doubt contained by the relatively smallness of each part, the ""special guest star"" actors punch home the symbolic value of their parts and fade into the ensemble before revealing their characters' shallowness. Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Ryan Phillippe, Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton stand out, as does rapper Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, playing with nice irony someone who hates rap because it is degrading to black people.<br/><br/>Yet, rather than having the flavor of a MAGNOLIA or a SHORT CUTS, the story plays out like a grim politically correct ""Love Boat."" It's more glib than gritty. As a cultural mosaic, the film is more of a clash than a crash. The individual elements are intriguing and well made; but, when seen as a whole, the effort to make it all mesh into a complete mural seems artificial. There are far too many coincidences in far too short of a time. Haggis the director does just fine, but Haggis the writer succumbs to the impulse to make it all fit together in a tidy little package. As such, the jolts are more like fender benders than head-on collisions and the film dents when it tries to devastate."

","Crash is an intelligent, well acted, thought provoking film that will be cherished by film fans for years to come.<br/><br/>The direction by newcomer Paul Haggis is breathtaking.

The score by Mark Isham is quite moody, and slightly in the vein of something like 'Requiem for a Dream'.<br/><br/>What's great about the film is that the drama here seems so very real. I think it's because the issues it addresses hit home quite well. Not since 'American History X' has the subject of racism been handled so very well in a film.<br/><br/>And after seeing this and 'Hotel Rwanda' not too long ago, I can say Don Cheadle is one of todays greatest actors.

","Crash (2004): Dir: Paul Haggis / Cast: Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Sandra Bullock: Great film that is not to be confused with the David Cronenberg thriller, this film addresses a clash in cultures and races and a tragedy to boot. Director Paul Haggis does a fantastic job at weaving together numerous subplots. Don Cheadle plays a police detective investigating a murder. This ranks as one of his best performances as he deals with the corruption and racism around him. Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who struggles in caring for his ill health father. Earlier in the film he and a rookie pull over a couple and he molests the female while her husband reluctantly ignores it. This comes to an interesting stand still when Dillon answers a call to another accident where he must face his disposition. Thandie Newton plays a victim of Dillon's discrimination who is angry at her husband's lack of action during the assault. Ryan Phillippe plays a rookie cop trying to play it by the book until a sudden tragedy occurs. He rode with Dillon until their views came into clash. Sandra Bullock also delivers one of her strongest performances as someone caught within an accident of her own. What is fascinating is how every character is seen as both good and bad and that we can all do one or the other until a tragedy occurs that open our eyes to the important things that we drive by. Score: 10 / 10"

","In the movie Crash we see a great lineup with Sandra Bullock as Jean Cabot, Don Cheadle as Det. Waters, Matt Dillon as Off. Ryan, Brendan Fraser as Rick Cabot, Ludicrous as Anthony, and Terrance Howard as Cameron Thayer. <br/><br/>This is a very dark drama based on a very touchy topic in modern society.......Racism. In this film we see people from every walk of life and everyone of them is guilty of racism in some form or on some level. The scary thing of the situation is they are all so vocal about it and they don't care who hears. The only plus to this issue is that derogatory names are not used and that certainly helps the film.<br/><br/>Jean and Rick Cabot are attacked at gunpoint after which Jean becomes very vocal with her racism and she directs it at anyone who isn't white. Det, Waters refers to his partner and lover as a Mexican when in reality her heritage is Puerto Rican and El Salvadorean. Officer Ryan is racist towards blacks and doesn't care who knows it and he treats blacks as if they are criminals just because of there skin color. Anthony is racist towards white people and Cameron has an issue with the police because Officer Ryan molested his wife and made him watch.<br/><br/>This movie is dark and dealing with racism much as they did in the movie Dark Blue (2002) starring Kurt Russel. Everyone one of us is and can be guilty of racism given a certain situation. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie is that everyone who mistreats others in this film all have to learn a very valuable lesson. What goes around comes around. Fortunately some lessons can be learned the hard way without anything incredibly serious having to happen.<br/><br/>I don't really want to say much more due to concern of giving it away. Great film and I highly recommend it. Beware it is full of crass language from beginning to end."

","Big cities do not apparently conform to human nature - people are tired, nervous, and all this is reflected on rude behavior, including on people's gender, race and/or profession. Paul Haggis has created a realistic atmosphere in one of them - Los Angeles where people of different background and races must intertwine and cope with each other; unfortunately, race-related positive discrimination has created some injustice and abuse of ""advantage"", resulting with things easily getting out of hand.<br/><br/>The cast is very strong, although there is no leading character, all have kind of supporting roles. But names like Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard, William Fichter are a sign of quality, and they are pleasant to follow. But the most interesting role was played by Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges whose statements on racial tensions make you giggle - in spite of seriousness beyond... Most of characters act in couples, but not all pairs are equally interesting or contributing to the run of events, they seem to act in a parallel universe.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Crash is a conspicuous movie - no wonder it was awarded 3 Oscars (plus 3 nominations) - as it combines felonies and profundity in a distinctive manner."

The film has unexpected twists but none of them are contrived. Each character is developed just enough for us to develop our opinions of them and then things change. Those of us familiar with LA will recognize the icons of the city and the mix of cultures. Each character has enough prejudice or hate in his/her repertoire of life to demonstrate we had better not be too quick to judge without exploring what might in us be similar to the characters' flaws.

The lack of communication causes a series of reactions ridiculous and absurd coming to brushing against the absolute tragedy. A moving and thought-provoking film, where the idea that we do about the characters is meant to be completely changed by the evolution of the facts.

","This movie is definitely not a watch-and-forget kind of thing. It gets you thinking. It's not actually about the story itself but about what stands behind it, not about what's happening, but about why it is happening. All the separate shorelines evolve in a parable kind of way sometimes balancing on the line between being very real and almost caricature like which yet makes them even more true to life. Some dialogs make you laugh while others bring you on the verge of tears, but this is what life is about, right? Of course, the movie can not escape exaggerating at times, going about the same old thing all over again, but it does not make it boring, it just adds more angles. The question of racism in the modern society is thoroughly examined in the film, but you can't help but start to think about other problems of the day, as everything is interconnected in life. Just like in this movie. People crash into each other and change each others' lives the way they could never imagine. The development of the story is logical enough yet one of the micro stories left me unsatisfied (well it's kind of turned out to be one of the central ones). Perhaps I'm just reading too much into it, or not everything is so simple. Some messages delivered are quite controversial, yet it all depends on the way you read them. This movie is not a light watch, but I would recommend it to those who like it when movies get under their skin and won't let go easily.

Many of the people you want to have a horrible death in the early part of the movie are redeemed or partly redeemed later on.<br/><br/>The problem with such a huge cast, there is hardly any time for each of the stars, especially Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser.<br/><br/>There is one intricately crafted plot line that suddenly twists and leaves you gasping, and in tears for ten minutes.

"bty33","10","1","3","18 March 2012"," Crash- Review
","In this 2004 drama, we are told the story of how people's lives are interconnected by race, tragedy, and forgiveness. In Los Angeles we get a look into the lives of eight very different people. We have the politician and his wife (Sandra Bullock), the two black carjackers (Anthony and Peter), an Iranian store owner, a racist Caucasian cop (Matt Dillon), and a wealthy black couple (Cameron and Christine Thayer). All of these people are connected by racial tension. Throughout the movie, we watch as each one of them reaches a breaking point. As they interact with one another things start breaking loose.<br/><br/>The theme, race, is overwhelmingly obvious right from the start. Every one of the major players are at fault. The two black men feel as if they are unfairly treated for being black but then turn around and hijack Rick and Jean Cabot. Sandra Bullock plays the convincing role as Jean Cabot, the District Attorney's wife. She herself has issues accepting her Hispanic maid Maria. At the end of the movie, Jean falls down the stairs and is taken to the hospital by Maria. It is this act that helps open her eyes to the fact that the problem may lay within her own way of thinking. Another main character who comes to a realization is Officer John Ryan (played by Matt Dillon). He is a racist who uses his authority to his advantage. We see this when he pulls over Cameron and Christine Thayer (played by Terrance Howard and Thandi Newton). He is surprised to see that they are in fact a wealthy, nice black couple. He is angered by this and takes it out by sexually assaulting Christine. Later in the movie, Christine is involved in a bad car accident. Officer Ryan is on the scene and tries to help her out of her flipped car. She panics and doesn't want her to touch his because of their previous run in. He eventually talks her into letting him help her. The pure emotion on his face tells us that he has realized how ignorant he has been. As she is being led away she looks back at him in a new light.<br/><br/>The film is full of incidents just like these. Each character learned a life lesson through the consequences of their own actions. This film focused on real life issues and did it unapologetically. That alone made this a winner in my book. It was impossible to ignore the realities present in the film. I believe the stronger the reaction, the better the film. Crash not only kept my riveted in the story but caused an emotional reaction to more than one incident. I would highly recommend this film."
"Christopher_Reid","7","1","3","17 June 2007"," Very good film-making and great acting but with a contrived script.
","Crash is a very engaging and original film that I think deserves much of the praise it has received. The acting is consistently great, the style is very effective and there are some very memorable moments. It's able to achieve a kind of raw power at times that puts many other dramatic films to shame. However, it has its flaws too and unfortunately they prevented me from enjoying the movie as much as I might have otherwise.<br/><br/>In a way, the script is one of Crash's strengths. The dialogue is very natural and most of the characters are fleshed out quite well. Some very interesting ideas are explored, most of them related to racism but also some of a more general nature. However, I thought the script didn't hold up quite as well when taken as a whole.<br/><br/>By the third or fourth scene, a pattern has already started to emerge. A few characters of various ethnic backgrounds are thrown into some kind of situation, take every remark they possibly can the wrong way and end up in a heated argument. This formula becomes repetitive and even predictable. Each character's actions end up feeling artificial - they have no sense of humour and they invariably end up taking things the wrong way. Although this makes for the most conflict, it ruins any deeper meaning the movie might have otherwise achieved. The abundance of coincidences does not help fix this problem.<br/><br/>Once the script becomes predictable (almost to the point of being clichéd), it is difficult to care much for the characters. They are more like actors playing a series of (very) dramatic scenes than real people - I was constantly reminded that I was just watching a movie, not real peoples' lives. This destroys the movie's flow.<br/><br/>One other comparatively minor flaw I felt Crash had was the occasionally distracting music. In particular the parts with the singing voice. The music by itself might be good but I thought it was just too obvious and dramatic for the movie. Plus, it literally drew attention to itself and took me out the film whenever it played.<br/><br/>In summary, Crash is a series of well directed scenes with great acting and very good dialogue that cover a series of relevant and interesting issues. For the most part it is not at all pretentious which is often tricky to achieve. Considered as an entire film though, it comes across as very contrived and rather uninvolving by the end due to the script. Still, it's good and highly recommended for anyone and everyone."

","I thought crash was a very well done film, but overly exaggerated the issues and racial tension present. I agree that there are significant issues regarding race that are troubling this nation, but some of the scenes of crash were not too believable. To clarify, people do not usually openly verbally attack others with racial slurs and tirades for relatively no reason, and the fact that all these people and their stories are interconnected is too much for me. Yes there are racist people but all of them reaching a breaking point at the same time culminating in a climactic ending is too much of a stretch. Overall it was another clever writing scheme that involved a dozen characters who through seemingly unrelated events come together in the end and their stories piece together nicely for cinema. I don't know about everyone else, but i am getting kind of tired of these kind of movies. Best picture... I don't think so."

","Often it's heard that style wins over substance or visa versa, yet here's a matter where the subject material wins hands down over that actual substance of the film, and in fact, style tops substance here as well. There are moments of genius and then these are tempered by some of the most inane and absurd scenes to be in any academy award winning best film of the year. There's great acting, great dialog, and a mastery of cinematic statement, then in the next moment there's trite scriptwork, flat cardboard characterizations, and ordinary visuals that could be topped by a TV production. I suppose this might have to do with the nature of the experience, the juxtaposition of the lives of the several challenged individuals, the involvement of the actors and possible non-involvement of some, and perhaps even the order in which scenes were filmed. While I enjoyed this film, I do not see in it the same power of statement that I saw in Boyz and the Hood, for example. I also see that some of it rings true and then much of it also rings false. Of course, there is always the big problem inherent in all motion pictures of using stereotypical behavior to send the big message, after all it is only a two hour or so experience and a lot has to be said, and stereotypes help us to GET IT?! quickly. That's a tough thing for a film intent on breaking down stereotypes to rely upon. If you think there's no stereotyping here, you'd better look at it again and pay close attention to the Asian portrayals, the temperamental Persian man, and Sandra Bullock and hubby. Oh, I almost forgot the gun shop owner, Hollywood's idea of every American male between LA and NY City. A very good, nearly great work, but not the best of the year.

I don't understand it. Brokeback Mountain was so much superior. This was a compelling and realistic portrayal of racism and the seedy side of life in modern Los Angelee. The movie is abundant with profanity and violence and characters that seem to have nothing to do with each other, yet are somehow connected to the fabric of the city. Look, it is a good movie, but a best picture Oscar winner. I think absolutely not. It is not in that league."
"dubhna","7","1","3","18 January 2006"," racism comes in many colors
","This is a great film that's marred by its absurd amount of contrived moral ""incidents"" in its finale. one or two of these would have been enough to hammer the message home. I desperately tried not to be cynical but towards the end i was loosing the battle. Having said that is an amazing film with a great cast and stand out performances particularly from Tandie Newton. And she is English too! Sandra bullock also gives an against type performance which adds to the power of her character. I recommend seeing this film and leaving all cynicism at the door. If you can do that you will enjoy this film. It will hit you hard at times but that is what any good film should do. But if you can't come with an open mind read below! Though it aims to turn stereotypical views on racism on their head i feel it nearly achieves this too well in creating a group of people who seem to be obsessed with race and the issues that surround a multicultural society. It seems any time we catch a glimpse of them they are making some kind of racial observation and you feel at times they have nothing better to do with their lives. Obviously this film has an agenda and thus we need to be exposed to its themes and issues but there is such thing as overkill. It works the ""mixed up morals"" theme also. Particularly with the two ""hoods"" Anthony and his friend. Anthony has a extreme devotion to his racial roots while his friend, though willing to kill, keeps a saints relic in his pocket. Yet its the actors that save this film from becoming a new age ""moral of the story"" tale and that is saying a lot; that they manage to bring it above this. Ultimately i can sum up my gripes by saying i wondered what i should feel with Damon's Character. He's a good cop who looks after his ailing father yet brutally molests woman while on the beat. I felt this was verging on arrogant by the writer in his aim to create such a conflicting character. Film offers great power in unleashing the imagination but this seems to smack of a character solely created to get a reaction, to fit a ""cool"" idea that the writer came up with."
"morknme6","7","1","3","3 January 2006"," Excellent movie but predictable
","This movie is a mirror of racism in the US. The acting is excellent, the racism is a reality and no one should miss this film. What is missing is what makes a movie great instead of good. We know from the first 15 minutes that it's about racism and the rest of the movie shows excellent examples of how racist America is but that is the problem. Since we know that the movie is going to give us unabashed racism and does, then anyone seeing the film should know what each scene is going to depict before the scene is shown. Nonetheless, even though the movie is totally predictable, it is not shallow or thin, in fact it's thick and fat with reality. Don't let the fact that every racist cliché you're ever heard interfere with the high quality of acting and the seriousness of this film. It is worth seeing for two reasons, superb acting and a chance for each of us to see a little of ourselves. Al Goodin"
"greened_out_","8","1","3","7 December 2005"," I expected there to be a crash!
","Basically I expected there to be a crash but there were 2 minor incidents. It's a good film regardless, but I was left with an open wound after the closing scene (just a minor bumper to bumper - not a spoiler). It gets a bit heavy in places and it's good to see Sandra Bullock in the background for a change (she can be a bit OTT). It was funny to see her fall down the stairs though (also not a spoiler). In fact I'd say the film is worth watching just for that. 20 minutes into the film the characters were very well developed, the choice of casting was excellent and I felt involved with each characters issues. I think the film really could have done with a crash though to bring it all together. If you're looking for a good crash don't watch this film. Other than that it's something i'll be watching again."
"jayphilippe626","7","1","3","13 November 2005"," It deals with the unspoken turmoil of various racial groups that still goes on today in society but which is unsaid
","Crash done by the same director of Magnolia involves the same mangling of sub plots that tie them all together at the end. It is not as artistic as Magnolia, but teaches an imperative moral story. Crash is almost like American Beauty as well. Although it pertains to racism. The characters deal with different scenarios between someone of another ethnic decree, and sheds a light on their stereotypical biasness that come out and feed into the racist perception, which has plagued our nation for the last 100 years. At the end of the movie the characters realize that their unspoken/spoken racist perceptions consequently, negatively effected them physically and mental as well as others. The characters soon do a u-turn such as Matt Dillion's character in the movie, where he risks his own life to save the Aftrican American woman stuck in a car, which earlier in the movie he sexually violates in front of her boyfriend, who was of the same ethnicity to show his racist views. This definitely moves the audience and makes you rethink of our own racist views and how deep they go and affect others."
"Nozze-Musica","Null","1","3","28 October 2005"," Took me completely by surprise.
","When I saw Sandra bullock was in a movie I figured it would be something pretty light weight like Hope Floats. But Sandra Bullock has a relatively small part in this interwoven and complex character study, Crash. The movie, which has a number of very big stars and familiar character actors come together brilliantly to give us a showcase of the American identity, in race, and in our acceptance of others. So many stories come together to create a brilliantly subtle and awesome movie about who we are.<br/><br/>The plot is too complicated to go into in a forum like this, but there are a number of different small stories, such as the cop who is a bigot, and who is trying to get decent health care for his ailing pops. then there is the black TV producer who sees bigotry in more ways than one even in his wealthy lifestyle. So many other small stories but those are some of the plot lines of note.<br/><br/>The characters are quite incredible, and are generally much more real and substantive than a lot of characters in Hollywood films, but here the characters seem so real, they seem so multi-dimensional, the good guys turn out sometimes to be bad guys, and the bad guys turn out to be good guys. A lot of times in this movies characters no matter if they are good or bad turn out to be completely unexpected.<br/><br/>There have been so many movies that have examined their perspective times and mores many years ago, some movies were so good at showing who we were as a society, and examining ourselves. there really hasn't been a movie in recent years that has examined our generation in such a way. As we speak society is becoming more isolated and distant, even from our own neighbor. In this culture of distance and isolation Crash comes up and examines the culture, and is set in a city that might be the epitome of modern day isolation, distance, and decadence: Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The movie also examines the increasing multi-cultural society that is becoming America and how everybody, rich, poor, powerful, working-class, fits into it. Kudos to all of these actors who make this really good script come to life in such a way. I am sad that there are so few movies like this. There was a time movies like this could not have been made, with this kind of intensity, with this kind of social commentary, there should be a lot more movies like this. A lot of movies, even independent movies do talk about social situations like this, but the characters sometimes seem fake, and the story lines contrived. But this movie has rich people, poor people, every kind of person from every kind of background you can think of, nobody in vogue, not too many people that are extremely popular, the movie is just real, one of the most real I have seen in recent memory, this movie is a must see, and hopefully an Oscar Contender."
"ktappe","5","1","3","27 October 2005"," Puppet show
","I normally don't comment on films, but this one really disappointed me enough that I have to say something in response to all the 10-star reviews on here. Way too often in ""Crash"" we see characters doing or saying things for one and only one reason--because the director needs them to get themselves into situations that he desires later in the film. You can very easily see it--characters are inconsistent throughout. One minute they're complete jerks and the next they're sweet or heroic. One minute they're funny, the next they're philosophical. First they're meek, the next they're aggressive. Yes, real people have multiple sides to their personalities, but they don't swing nearly as far or as fast as the characters in ""Crash"". You can just see the writer pulling their strings like marionettes. Another well-known screenwriter (JMS) once contemplated how his characters often surprised him by doing things he didn't expect. That is good writing. What we have here are characters with no minds of their own; they are mere extensions of the writer's fingers, manipulating the story (and the viewer) for his whims. Problem is, I don't happen to like being manipulated. In a good film, characters stay consistent, react realistically, speak using real English, and actually have a sense of self- preservation (trying not to get shot, for example.) A truly good film would have been less heavy-handed, less forced, less didactic, and way less coincidental."
"Chewbacca_42","6","1","3","18 October 2005"," A Good Set of Brakes, Please
","Mainstream film is certainly awash in remakes and formulae and Crash is an earnest attempt at topical gravitas. ""Crash's"" ambition merits some recognition. Its over-ambition leads it astray. One can attempt to defend impossible irony and coincidence by presenting it all as fantastical allegory. Yet, ""Crash's"" downfall is that is seems to initially aspire to verisimilitude and it never transcends into obvious metaphor. The unlikely occurrences on screen then ring falsely. And I'll take my Sandra Bullock ""perky,"" thank-you-very-much. Just kidding, Sandy, kudos to you and the ""Crash"" crew. Please note: if you have failed to find Ms. Bullock anywhere on screen, please check you have not in error Net-Flixed David Cronenberg's ""Crash,"" the ultimate car- and flesh-melding metaphor from James Ballard's pornographic novel, which they assigned me in Contemporary British Literature class."
"jdgratz","7","1","3","8 September 2005"," A good watch, but definitely NOT tops!
","Maybe I have lost my heart for films that tackle controversial issues, but this didn't seem that far off base from any other one I've seen.<br/><br/>Okay, let's break it down. Everyone is a racist. There, that just about does it.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is a bit of a rash way to describe the entire film, and I mean it with a grain of salt. The fact is that all of us have some sort of prejudice to some other group of people (regardless of what the definitive characteristic of that group may be; IE - they like to butter their toast on the other side than I do).<br/><br/>This movie tackles the fact that in many cases of intelligent society, the reasons for this prejudice is due to life experience as opposed to learned ignorance. In other words, seemingly consistent activity (or at least 'seemingly consistent' according to statistics) of any particular sect of society has lead to a label whereby that activity is expected before rational judgment can be made. Sometimes, the rational judgment comes too late.<br/><br/>The writer of this screenplay does a good job of explaining this and getting it across. This is why I cannot completely downplay this film. However, it seems like this intention is all that is successfully put forth for the first two-thirds of the film.<br/><br/>The script seems more like someone had some great speeches he/she wanted to read to some people. Well, since some person reading speeches doesn't appeal to the masses, it's easier to convert the speeches into a screenplay and make some money off of the message.<br/><br/>Now, with this, it is understandable why the characters' racism is so 'in-you-face' for the majority of the movie. We did not get to grow up with each character, nor do we know why they think the way they think. The only way to successfully get an audience to accept a personality in a short period of time is to shove it down their throats.<br/><br/>The final third of the movie aggressively tries to complete each story, and does so in a fairly acceptable fashion. Almost every question is answered, lives are changed, and messages come full circle. For this purpose, I will give this movie a 7 out of 10. It functions as a message, explains that there are different reason why people fall prey to such activity, and defines how single incidents and accidents can alter one's entire life perception. But, it is a far cry from a perfect 10, much less do I think it deserves the company of IMDb's top 250."
"geary642","Null","1","3","27 August 2005"," Great Movie that should make you think as well as feel!!
","The acting was great, some actors stood out more than others. To me that is not the most important thing here, the ""Message"" from the writer and director is the key. ""You don't really know who you think you are."" Push the wrong button on anyone of us and you will find another person emerges that you never consciously thought existed within you. The movie made you ""feel"" to get your attention the key I think was to make us all ""think"" of how we perceive and treat each other and the consequences. Judging a book by it's cover is always a mistake in life. Unfortunately looking at our own inner motives and understanding their origins is not a popular thing to do for any of us and the story of Crash will continue somewhere everyday but not understood. Excellent movie."
"dynamohums","6","1","3","25 July 2005"," Disappointing
","One thing's for sure - this is not of the calibre of an Anderson or Altman, despite the director's obvious frames of reference. <br/><br/>The plot development was telegraphed for all to see, and the rather cynical attempts at wringing the emotions while tying up the loose ends of the various strands made it feel like a daytime soap (written by someone who feels he should be doing something more 'worthy'). <br/><br/>Every character seems to have reached an epiphany by the final reel, despite the wildly variant moralities on display. Maybe this is the most interesting aspect of the film, but sometimes it is better to make a stance and take a view rather than let it blow in the wind as this director seems to prefer. <br/><br/>Although one may read the premise of 'Crash' as being relating to racism (in all it's forms), in the end the ambiguity on offer lets it down badly and 'soft-soaps' the issues - when a more confrontational view may be more useful and relevant in highlighting the world we all live in."
"j_graves68","5","1","3","3 June 2005"," a crash-test dummy?
","This film grabbed my attention because it's not the typical commercial mainstream movie, even though it's playing in typical commercial mainstream theatres right now. I have always had an affinity for the avant garde or alternative films in today's cinema, and with an all-star cast that you know took these roles for chump change, one cannot help but to be attracted to it. The first name that caught my eye's was Sandra Bullock's (which coincidently IS the first name listed). And this film didn't seem to be a lite, cutesy one (since that's all she ever does), so I thought it'd be worth checking out with names like Don Cheadle, Thandie Newton, and William Fichtner also on its venue.<br/><br/>I grew up in Thousand Oaks and Orange County in the 1970s & '80s, and back then they were the most homogenized Wonder Bread cities (I think T.O. still is). Fast-forward to the early nineties, and I lived in Pasadena and the L.A. basin for years. And what I couldn't believe this time was how my white friends were so racist, and yet L.A.'s the last place to live if one wanted to practice being a successful bigot. I think because I come from a religiously mixed family (Christian & Jewish), I feel like I have little room to be prejudice. Yet we all are, and my dad's resentment towards southeast Asians seems to rub off on me at times. ""Crash"" is an equal opportunity abuser: it does not favor any race, and white people are NOT the only prejudice people on this earth (which some people have conditioned society to believe).<br/><br/>Although some viewers may have been offended by its raw content at times or that it was pretentious, ""Crash"" illustrates older, played-out issues that still seem to linger subliminally and in plain sight. This is not an uplifting movie, yet it is a somewhat powerful one, nor is it black or white (no pun was intended there). Everyone's wrong. This film was with racism how ""Traffic"" was to drugs. This even reminded me at times of ""Traffic"" with its score and the intertwining multiple characters (Don Cheadle de'ja vu'd me, too). Possibly the most poignant and powerful scene was where the Latino locksmith came home to be confronted by the Persian shopkeeper and his revolver. The locksmith's 5-year-old little girl jumps into his arms believing that she could deflect the bullet with her ""invisible cloak"" that she believed was ""Impenetrable"" just as the gun fires. That part made my heart stop and my blood chill. And my eyes glazed like donuts as I watched the little girl's reaction to it.<br/><br/>To me, Matt Dillon's punishment for molesting that woman was realized both by watching his father suffer and by having to face her again in a dire situation. Brendan Fraser was underused (as well as Ms. Bullock), and I wish I could of seen more, because it seemed to me that he was having an affair with his assistant (who was African American). That would of been an interesting interracial subplot right there, and it probably was. However, my guess is that it wound up on the cutting room floor because it would of dragged the film.<br/><br/>That'll probably be in the deleted scenes material for the DVD.<br/><br/>I haven't seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" yet, but I think that because of the success to that film, this one was able to be produced. I also remember seeing Don Cheadle's name there, too. Otherwise, methinks this would simply have been an unfilmable script if it weren't for the named actors in it who all put their one-an-a-half and two cents in."
"dj_bassett","Null","1","3","6 June 2005"," Good first half, then loses it's way
","A God's-eye view of LA, which director Haggis sees as a place full of racial conflict and rough racial accommodation. Everyone's quick on the trigger, everyone's quick to claim victim-hood status, as well -- although the truth's a lot more complicated.<br/><br/>The first half is great, with dialog so sparkling I almost thought it was a Tarantino flick, if Tarantino was trying to do a message movie about racial relations. The inter-cutting between the different points of view are well done, everyone gives good performances (the Larenz Tate/Ludicrous car-jackers-cum-comedy-duo being especially outstanding), and the dialog absolutely leaps off the page.<br/><br/>The movie runs into real trouble in the second half, starting with SPOILERS Matt Damon's improbable rescue of Thandie Newton from a burning car (he had previously groped her while her husband watched in a shocking scene). One such improbability I can swallow, but then they start coming fast and furious: Larenz Tate turns out to be Don Cheadle's missing brother, Ryan Phillipe acts in a way completely contradictory to his character as set up, as does Sandra Bullock, etc. All of these forced moments seem to be designed to give the characters an Epiphanic Moment, but that's not how it works. You can't force these things -- epiphanies come naturally out of the flow of the story.<br/><br/>What had previously seemed fresh and exciting, a unique way to talk about race in America, soon becomes ever-more contrived. It's almost as if you can feel the force of the narrative press down on them, to the detriment of the film.<br/><br/>It's too bad, because the first half really is spectacular."
"nowonmai42","5","1","3","28 May 2005"," ""Magnolia"" with racism instead of frogs
","""Crash"" has aspirations of being an operatic saga of racial resentment and misplaced aggression. With its large cast of characters whose stories occasionally intersect and bounce off one another like bumper cars, it recalls ""Magnolia"" and ""2 Days In the Valley,"" but seriously lacks the substance to fill out the heft of its ambitions. A film this dedicated to race needs to have something urgent to say, but ""Crash"" is mostly content with a series of broad sketches, injected with some truly troubling notions of racism and its effects.<br/><br/>We're introduced to a large assembly of characters, most of whom go unnamed, or whose names are mentioned only in passing. We're all victims and all aggressors, the film is telling us; what do names matter? There's the district attorney and his wife who are carjacked by two black thugs who wax poetic about constantly being taken for thugs. The honest Chicano locksmith always seems to incur his customers' wrath in spite of his solid work. There's the rageful racist cop who, after seeing his father denied medical coverage by a black HMO receptionist, takes it out on a couple of innocent, affluent black motorists. ""Crash"" keeps its huge cast in check only by treating them as ciphers. The only notable attribute displayed by any one of them is to be a victim or perpetrator of misplaced racial anger, and in many cases both.<br/><br/>What disturbs about ""Crash"" is its assertion that race continues to divide us not through the enduring power and harm of stereotypes and misconceptions, but by how true such stereotypes often are. Are we by now so conditioned with knee-jerk rejections of such types that we've become blind to the dangers they underscore? There are several ""but what about?"" moments that give doubt to the film's intentions. Of course the vast majority of young black men are not gangbangers and criminals, but what about the characters played by Ludicrous and Larenz Tate, who are? Clearly most Caucasian LAPD patrolmen are not Mark Furman-like white devils, but what about Matt Dillon, who thrills to molesting a black woman in front of her husband at a traffic stop? I don't think ""Crash"" wants us to take such incidents at face value, but it lingers on them long enough to suggest that, well, black thugs and white racist cops ARE the problem, rather than the tragic symptoms of far deeper sociological pathologies.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film hopes to illustrate that we're all guilty, yet capable of redemption. While many of its more loathsome characters find some measure of humanity, several of the more upstanding have, by the end, fallen victim to their own unsuspected prejudices. It's difficult to care much one way or the other, though. Such thinly-drawn characters have put nothing at stake for us. Their sins and redemptions, no matter how grandiose, feel distant and hollow. In trying to be all things to all people, ""Crash"" ends up being little of anything. It's on to something with the uncomfortable questions about race relations upon which it touches, but is just trying to swallow whole a subject that demands small bites, and a lot of chewing."

Crash is a movie that touches on a couple of different life stories and how they link together. This movie makes you think about destiny and how easily your life can change. The acting is in my opinion terrific. Everything is very realistic and it is interesting to see how the different characters interact with each other.

","I saw this film months ago and am now compelled to throw in my two cents after its Best Picture win at the '05 Oscars. There seems to be a LOT of negative buzz at this picture's win...a lot of criticism... Oh well...<br/><br/>What people seem to have a problem with here is that all of these characters give voice to what many of us supposedly only THINK...Good Heavens, we'd never actually SPEAK the racist remarks so prevalent throughout this film would we?. But this IS in fact a film...It IS a vehicle where characters can in fact become representative and ""iconistic""...Matt Dillon's cop, The Persian store-owner, the D.A.'s wife and so on...these are all representative of larger bases-of many many people in our diverse set of cultures. The film gives voice to many fears and frustrations in our thoughts that drive societies in negative ways. When this is accepted, then Crash's writing becomes brilliant. The story clicks and moves, with many surprising tie-ins and amazing twists and at least one tear-jerk scene involving a small child. Nothing is what it seems, yet much of what we see on the surface is seemingly common-place. The ensemble cast is directed masterfully; the acting is strong - the stories all stand on their own. This is in fact a passionate work with much more to say than just ""Racism is hugely present in American Society."" As a 20 year veteran of Law Enforcement in Los Angeles, I was moved by and could relate to the many complexities in this film! Congratulations on the Best Picture Oscar!"

He succeeded and you could see it in his eyes and body movements. under no circumstance did he forget the brutality of his earlier actions.

But the approach and idealism derived from the Haggis were too excessive. I did not find this movie ""provocative"" as it advertises, but more offensive.

It covered nothing new, and seeing a bunch of big movie names overacting and - especially in the case of Bullock - trying to be serious when this is NOT their natural acting style (did no-one tell her?) was eye-wateringly bad. The only plot strand that got close to anything meaningful was with Damon and Newton - acting was streets ahead of the others, and the story almost believable. The antecedents for social racism were made clear here, and demonstrated its contrast with PERSONAL conflicts which are often more complex and ambiguous.<br/><br/>Overall though, hackneyed, patronising, and with a lazy script. The fact it beat 'Brokeback Mountain' for academy award for best film was for me the final damnation."

","I could write pages about how great Crash was, I seriously could. But I'm not gonna' waste your time. Here's a basic summary of Crash, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Crash is about so many things that we face every day. Our constant battles against racism, our battered family relationships, our lost sense of hope, the constant resort to violence that harms more innocent than guilty; but most of all, the realization of our errors, and taking steps, whether they be large or small, towards fixing them.<br/><br/>After watching this movie my views on racism didn't change, I've always seen racism as immoral; and I didn't decide to go all out against guns (although I am). When I finished watching Crash, I was forced to look at my own errors, seeing that like everyone, I have quite a few. But I'm still hopefull, because I'm working to change those errors now, and I know that if I can, others can too. This movie restores hope for the hopeless."
"lee_eisenberg","10","2","11","25 February 2006"," Forget everything that you ever imagined.
","For years, the movie industry was afraid to tackle racism, and when they finally did, the movies were good but were a little too straight forward about their subjects to fully get into the issues (think ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). ""Crash"", on the other hand, gets down and dirty in every way. Focusing on how a car crash and the racially charged associations therewith affect several people in LA, the movie is as gritty as ""LA Confidential"".<br/><br/>It's hard to sum ""Crash"" up easily, as it looks more at stereotypes than at simple discrimination. It portrays the obvious tensions (if a white person avoids a black person, does that make him/her racist?), but there's also a gun store owner who implies that a Middle Eastern man is trying to start a jihad. As for the LA police...well, you'll see what I mean if you see the movie.<br/><br/>The roles are all quite impressive. Terrence Howard plays a TV producer with trouble standing up for himself; Thandie Newton plays his hubby who gets on his case for not standing up for her; Matt Dillon plays a cop with a slightly aggressive streak; Ryan Philippe plays a rookie cop unsure about when to act; Don Cheadle plays a dignified but nervous detective; Brendan Fraser plays a district attorney fed up with his job; Sandra Bullock plays his unfulfilled wife; and Ludicrous plays a gang member.<br/><br/>A very good movie, but remember, not for the squeamish."

"poplicks","9","2","11","17 May 2005"," CRASH: an essay on race relations? No. A great movie? Yes.
","Odds are that I am neither the first nor the second nor the third person to recommend to you the movie Crash, the directorial debut by Million Dollar Baby writer Paul Haggis, who also co-wrote the compelling script.<br/><br/>Thus far, Crash is easily the best film of the year, which isn't saying much given its competition is Meet the Fockers and Monster in Law (when did in-laws become the new terrorists?). Similar to one of my favorite films Magnolia, this movie is a cross-cutting ensemble movie that interweaves the lives of different people in LA, colliding through serendipity, coincidence, or bad luck.<br/><br/>Given the diverse cast of characters that range the spectrum from hoodlums to politicians, I thought Haggis' script was the star of the film, as the diverse array of characters were all credible and convincing. I sensed that the entire theater (I saw the film with a mostly black audience in Oakland) was familiar with everyone on the screen. The writing, of course, was aided by the bomb cast, of which Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, and yes, Ludicrous stood out.<br/><br/>That said, I disagree with those touting this film as a brilliant essay on intolerance, stereotypes, and the American melting pot. I'm not sure this film says much on the nature of race relations, other than ""everyone's a little bit racist,"" to borrow a line from Avenue Q.<br/><br/>I thought the film was, quite simply, a great story. All the critics, on the other hand, seem to be engaging in a cinematic circle jerk in a frenzied quest to avoid the cracker and find deeper meaning in the fact that all the rainbow coalition of characters (except for the Chicano/Latino ones) are flawed.<br/><br/>For example, David Denby of the New Yorker writes that Crash is about:<br/><br/>... the rage and foolishness produced by intolerance, the mutual abrasions of white, black, Latino, Middle Eastern, and Asian citizens in an urban pot in which nothing melts. ... Apart from a few brave scenes in Spike Lee's work, 'Crash' is the first movie I know of to acknowledge not only that the intolerant are also human but, further, that something like white fear of black street crime, or black fear of white cops, isn't always irrational.<br/><br/>What? I'm guessing opium is what you'll find in this critic's pipe, although David Denby is Caucasian, not Asian, which means that he's a better driver than me and less likely to crash. Now please donate to the United Negro College Fund.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, Crash is a long collection of short stories that is simply the best entertainment that six dollars, using a senior citizen discount, can buy without involving donkeys and dynamite.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a thesis on race relations, you're better off watching something else."

That one black man with the bunny eyes sure gets mad when he is pulled over by the police. I hate to see LAPD portrayed like this though. For the most part, there is not THAT much racism in that LAPD. Matt Dillon sure did deliver some goods though!! In that one scene :::SPOILER:::: Where he sees that a black woman (from an earlier encounter) was trapped in the suv, I thought FOR SURE he was going to let her BURN!!! But he is not THAT racist.

","Crash, the movie, very well might be the best movie this year. Crash gets a FOUR COURSE MEAL review (for more writings, rantings, and reviews, go to www.kevacho.com).<br/><br/>There is something all together amazing about Crash it is not stupid. Crash does not patronize or condescend to the audience. Remarkably, Crash, deals with its viewers as if they were as intelligent as it is. The movie is not easy, it is not fed to us on a fork, the characters are complicated, the themes even more so. There are no hard and fast rules in the story, no easy answers. Every character has a valid point, and every character is flawed. There are many who will see this film and not understand it, just as they do not understand the word ambiguity; albeit I thought the director proved his point very clearly. That point to me was we all make mistakes, and regardless of the size of these mistakes, no one is perfect. Crash struck me as the kind of movie Magnolia attempted to be. You could even say that the snow at the end of Crash was a direct rip-off of the frogs at the end of Magnolia. However, the snow worked much better on an emotional level than the frogs.<br/><br/>Some people will see this movie simply as ""depressing"". The people behind Melissa and I thought and said as much. Yet this assessment of Crash would be tantamount to saying Good Fella's promoted mob-life, Train Spotting promoted drug use, or Black Hawk Down promoted war. An assessment that is simply wrong. If you see Crash and all you get from it is, and I quote, ""Gee that was a downer"" you need to take a good, long look at yourself. Crash takes a hard, penetrating, thoughtful gaze upon what it means to be human. Pure and simple, convoluted and complex, Crash has more meaning, more depth, more inherent thought and profundity than a bevy of over rated, over hyped summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>Oh and by the way, the screenplay is brilliant, the acting superb, the direction flawless, and the music by Mark Isham is transcendent. Do not miss this film. Run do not walk to the theaters to see Crash."

","I can't believe this masterpiece only made 9 million this week at the box office. I guess most people prefer to see crap like House of Wax over this. Anyway on to the movie. I thought this movie was one of the deepest, and most compelling dramas in a long time. The movie explores the struggles of different people of different racial groups and backgrounds in a single day in Los Angeles. The movie highlights especially all the prejudices that these several groups have against one another and the way some members of a particular race are viewed by members of another race. This movie, although somewhat offensive to some viewers, rings very true to a lot of us and dares to explore the prejudices that are present in almost every average American today, but the movie also shows us that although most everyday people might be prejudiced or a bit racist to some extent, in the end we're all humans and in the end the human compassion and heart overcomes racial prejudice. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges does a very impressive job in this movie and shows he takes acting seriously and that he is very dedicated. The rest of the cast is excellent, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Larenz Tate, Ryan Phillipe, Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser to name the familiar faces do a superb job in this film. The virtually unknown actors like Michael Peña (Latino locksmith) Shaun Toub (Persian store owner) and Bahar Soomekh (Persian Store owner's daughter) do an excellent job as well. This movie is definitely worth your ten bucks and two hours of your life. Ten out of ten."

","It is a surprise to see Sandra Bullock in a role in which you despise her. Like many of the other actors in the film you understand why people change, and the reason why they change. This is a movie that examines racism, from both sides. It is also a study on human nature, but from the bad side. This movie in my mind is a heavy weight. The character development helps you understand why the characters change, and why they do some of the things they do. You may need some-time after the movie to relax and bring in what you saw. GO with a friend or someone you can talk to after the movie so that you can fully understand why the characters did what they did. Go and see right away."
"johnmbale","10","2","11","10 May 2005"," Expect the Unexpected.
","Perhaps not since the days of D.W. Griffith has Hollywood tackled the theme of Intolerence as effectively as in ""Crash"". Set in Los Angeles the film covers 48 hours in the lives of a number of apparently unrelated people, who in unexpected ways meet and in doing so alter their lives for ever (much in the manner of a Robert Altman picture). The smouldering racial tension of a big city with a mix of ethic races, is the underlying theme as these characters interact. This is a strong though complicated drama that keeps you on the edge of your seat, as the characters collide in the most unexpected ways, nothing is as it seems, even the apparent miracle. Sharp clever dialogue reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction"" and fine acting cameos lift this production well above average. Notably Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, but the entire cast is remarkable. Its exceedingly well written and confidently brought to the screen, fine cinematography, and editing. My only slight niggle was the music, which in the cinema I saw the movie was too loud and distracting. This the first film of the Director Paul Haggis, also the writer, and he is a man to watch in future. He should go far."

","About half-way through, I was ready to walk out. It seemed like this movie was going nowhere that we hadn't already been. Typical ""pick on the police"" Hollywood garbage - portraying the bad guys as the good guys and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Then, the movie changed and we saw the reasons why the seemingly flawed characters, whose actions in the first half of the play were completely unflattering, behaved as they did. We were also provided moments when the earlier unflattering (and sometimes downright evil) behavior, was rendered meaningless because of newly introduced circumstances that truly tugged at my conscience and gave me a feeling of exultation at the inner workings of coincidence. In fact, it left me a feeling that there are no coincidences, that only God could intervene with new circumstances that provided the characters in the film with the second chances that could redeem their lives and give new hope to each. In the end, my heart was extremely moved to sympathy for some of the characters whom earlier I tended to condemn, and vice-versa.<br/><br/>I would have rated the it a 10, except for the fact that the movie still portrayed the LAPD as an overall evil and corrupt organization (an undeserved charge), and because of the excessive use of profane language (which, though realistic, is quite unnecessary)."

","The movie Crash was a difficult movie to watch. I really had no idea what the movie was about when I bought my ticket. I am very glad that I bought it, as I feel it is a life-changing movie. Racism is a theme that truly effects us all, every day of our lives, weather we realize (or even choose to admit!)it or not. After watching the movie, I think that we all will reexamine our lives, and make changes that need to be made. The actors in the movie portrayed (sadly)realistic characters, and it's embarrassing to say that, nearly everybody can relate with one character or another. The movie reminded me a lot of the movie Grand Canyon, starring Kevin Klien, Steve Martin, and Danny Glover...just an updated version."

","""Crash"" was quite a pleasant surprise. This movie, no matter what your view on racism, will keep you interested all the way through. This movie is more than just a ""Don't be a racist"" movie. It shows the two sides of people and the two sides of that topic as well. While its true the kid with the baggy jeans MIGHT try and steal your purse, he also MIGHT be studying to be a surgeon and save your life one day. I am not sure if that is what the director was going for but that is the message that I got out of this movie. This movie is for open-minded good humored people. If you take the racism topic too seriously some of the dialogue will make you angry. No one race is safe in this one. Only downfall to this movie in my eyes was that the characters might have been just a little bit exaggerated. Every time someone says ""hi"" a racial argument came up.

"ferguson-6","8","2","11","8 May 2005"," Missed the touch
","Greetings again from the darkness. Within the first 5 minutes, I was shifting in my seat and realized the dialog was making me extremely uncomfortable. My first reaction was that writer/director Paul Haggis (writer of ""Million Dollar Baby"", TV's ""L.A. Law"" ""Thirtysomething"" and ""Walker, Texas Ranger"") was using simple shock value to manipulate the audience on the topic of racism. The words and scenarios were almost cartoonish. As the movie went on, I realized this was very much an expose on the stereotypes and paranoia we all carry. Bigotry and intolerance and fear are widespread. Of course, very few of us wear it on our sleeves or are as indignant about it as most of the characters in the film, but Haggis is right in that this is not a subtle topic. Bust it open and examine it and MAYBE something good will happen.<br/><br/>The cast is huge and talented. Sandra Bullock, shaking off her ""Miss Congeniality"" persona, does great work in her limited screen time as the eternally angry princess who has refused to reflect. Don Cheadle turns in another of his sterling roles as the moralistic protector of all things good, only this time he has some demons of his own. Matt Dillon, in her first good performance since ""Drugstore Cowboy"", is terrific and steals most every scene. His character is the most complex, hated, misunderstood tough guy you have seen in awhile. The rest of the cast is filled out wonderfully by Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Terrence Howard (Gossie in ""Ray""), Larenz Tate (Quincy Jones in ""Ray""), Tony Danza, Keith David, Ryan Phillipe and Thandie Newton. Ludicrous deserves special mention for stepping up and playing the absolute most extreme racist (with a touch of humor) since Peter Boyle in ""Monster's Ball"".<br/><br/>There will be many comparisons to PT Anderson's great film ""Magnolia"" due to the overlapping story lines and criss-crossing of characters and I feel the spiritualism of the film can also be related to Kasdan's ""Grand Canyon""."
"skraps","10","2","11","8 May 2005"," The Great Melting Not
","Paul Haggis brilliantly exposes the inner thoughts of many Americans to the light of day in this exceptional film. A dozen Angelinos and 24 hours serve as his instruments; the seedier side of urbia his canvass. The failed American idea of blending the world's cultures into one, is deftly replaced by Mr. Haggis with a blending of diverse ideas into one American.<br/><br/>The ""man against himself"" conflicts, wonderfully portrayed by Matt Dillon, Sandra Bulloch, Terrence Howard and Ryan Phillippe, are center stage and framed by the more traditional ""man against man"" challenges of characters expertly brought to life by Don Cheadle, Shaun Toub, Thandie Newton and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges. Mr Toub's character (Farhad) is also the catalyst for the most heart-wrenching moments of the film.<br/><br/>If Mr. Haggis's ""day job"" wasn't writing (Crash, Million Dollar Baby, EZ Streets) I would urge him to give it up for directing. Pacing, performances and positioning of this caliber are normally the eyemarks of only the very best of the best.<br/><br/>Entering the theatre I expected, at best, an Altmanesque experience of quantity over quality. Leaving the theatre I felt shame for prejudging the movie by its inexperienced director and lack of ""stars."" This is one Crash you don't want to miss."

I almost missed seeing ""Crash"" after being irked and disappointed by the scenery-chewing Sean Penn in ""Mystic River."" I foolishly feared ""Crash"" would suffer from similar Oscar greed. Somehow I gambled and won. ""Crash"" combines gut-wrenching writing, crisp editing and ensemble acting in a film of grit and dirt not meant for the faint hearted. Here are stereotypes amped up and thrown together as only a bit city melting pot can. While some plots intersect too conveniently, their outcomes reward anyway.<br/><br/>This Los Angeles has no heroes, no gallant person charging up on a trusty steed to save the day. Here are flawed people acting foolishly and either escaping or paying. I loved every performance in this film, from familiar stars, familiar character actors and from fresh new people. I hope someone has the brains to thank and reward Don Cheadle for his contributions in this film, not just for his performance but for being the film's producer. His work continues to represent a gold standard for today's Hollywood."

","Prior to seeing ""Crash"" I had read a great deal about it and was, truth be told, expecting the worst and sincerely hoping for the best. Overall, I got the latter. I think it's very, very good with some absolutely brilliant moments in the film, and it is clear that Paul Haggis is one of the most talented people working in Hollywood now. Although I am not a big fan of all the interconnectedness of the film's characters (you can only rely on this scheme for so long, in my book anyway) and don't appreciate being strung along in a few of the sequences, Paul has elicited from his cast some of the most heart-breaking, poignant scenes captured on film in a long, long time. Thandie Newton's rescue scene is one. Matt Dillon's father's crying in the bathroom is another. And the filming of the invisible cloak scene early in the film is absolutely perfect. And much to my delight, Sandra Bullock is able to portray an unlikeable character and capture the frustrations of a control freak who realizes that she no longer has control over so many of the happenings and people around her. Hopefully she will stick to her word and ditch the romantic comedies going forward! And of course, the issues of race relations in America are the mainstay of the film. If nothing else, you and your friends will have plenty of topics to discuss as Haggis seems to have succeeded in covering just about every racial stereotype in America today."

","It's a shame that people don't line up around the block for films like this... films with a talented ensemble cast that deal with real issues, real people and real conflict. There's nothing fake about films like these... nothing escapist... it is just a slice of life story that hits home in palpable ways.<br/><br/>I suppose the easy way to classify ""Crash"" is by calling it a more commercial version of ""Magnolia"", ""Grand Canyon"" or ""Short Cuts"".<br/><br/>It is far shorter than any of those obvious comparisons and it is less ""artsy"". In other words, ""Crash"" is less concerned with impressive film-making and more concerned with efficient storytelling.<br/><br/>The downside to imitation is that the film feels slightly ""done already""... it needs an extra hook to keep us riveted. ""Crash"" uses racial stereotyping and tension as a means to an emotional end.<br/><br/>Like those other films, Los Angeles is the setting. I've lived in L.A. and can testify that it is the lonliest city in the world. You never really feel like you make any true connections with people in that city. All those that were born there have moved away, and all those who live there now are temporarily relocated from other cities. No one seems to call Los Angeles their real home.<br/><br/>The opening lines of the film, muttered by the fabulous Don Cheadle, capture that essence entirely.<br/><br/>I won't recount the many plot threads that this film traverses. But in true Altman / PT Anderson fashion, the stories are all interconnected via family or coincidence.<br/><br/>There are some truly remarkable performances in ""Crash"" despite the fact that no one really gets the bulk of the screen time.<br/><br/>Cheadle stands out and is quickly becoming one of our finest American actors. Jennifer Esposito delivers a fiery and powerful turn here. Even small roles by Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillippe, Brendan Fraser & William Fichtner deserve merit. Matt Dillon, Ludicrous, the sublime Thandie Newton, Michael Pena and Terrence Dashon Howard all deliver brilliantly. It is a great ensemble performance that will be remembered at next year's SAG awards.<br/><br/>The main issue I had with this film was its use of coincidence. It just seemed all too forced in this film that is otherwise based in very serious reality. I felt a little manipulated by some crafty screen writing. I didn't buy the plausibility of many of the situations.<br/><br/>I still recommend the film to any and all art house fans... but even with its desire to be more commercial than its predecessors, I don't think too many Star Wars fanatics will be giving up their place in line to watch this one. Those of you with Vin Diesel posters in your bedroom should steer well clear of ""Crash""!

It is best summed up in Graham's (Don Cheadle)first words, which I will not paraphrase here out of a sense of accuracy.<br/><br/>It is the attention to detail found within simple situations which this film uses to connect with the soul. Watching Daniel (Michael Anthony Peña, in a role sure to get his photograph on the IMDb) carefully and meticulously tie an imaginary cloak on his Daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez in her first big screen appearance) is an echo of the care Paul Haggis has used to sculpt this story.

Not because it won an Oscar for Best Picture but because it's one of those rare films that will leave you thinking about it long after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>'Crash' opens with a somewhat-dazed passenger inside a car contemplating human interaction in Los Angeles: ""In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.""<br/><br/>His partner, Ria, quickly dismisses his ramblings as a side-effect of the car crash that they have just survived.

A few seconds later, she steps out of the car and engages in a confrontation with the woman driver who had rear-ended them; her angry & offensive outburst is certainly not going to help the situation...<br/><br/>This sets the tone for the film - a social commentary that shows how many of us are quick to jump to conclusions (often using existing prejudices or stereotypes as fuel the fire), shows how we often don't consider - or care - how our choice of actions and words are perceived by others, and the consequences that may follow as a result.<br/><br/>'Crash' is a powerful, complex and clever film that presents its story in a somewhat unique manner. We ride along with an ensemble cast of close to 20 central characters of varying ethnicities, whose lives accidentally overlap over the course of the 2 days that we are privy to.<br/><br/>Is the scenario 'realistic'? Probably not - but that's not the point.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect, but its few flaws should not detract from the overall experience. There are moments of truth, moments of humour, moments that may shock you, moments that will touch you, and moments that will surprise you. And, there are also many moments that will appear all-too-obvious. That's kinda of the point though - we 'stereotype' things because we've seen it all before. Sometimes we're right, and sometimes we're wrong - but the important thing to realize is that if we rush to judgement, there may be consequences..<br/><br/>Many people say that 'Crash' is a film /about/ racism due to the character's conflicts which all revolve around race. Viewers who can look beyond 'race' and keep an open mind throughout and who consider how things might have turned out differently had the characters attitudes and/or actions been different - will likely enjoy the film. Viewers who jump to conclusions within the first 20 minutes - will not. And that's a shame, because it is precisely those people who are apt to jump to conclusions who could likely learn the most from 'Crash'.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Crash features a top-notch ensemble cast which includes: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendan Fraser, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Larenz Tate. All put in superb performances in a tight script which is at once gritty, heartwarming, shocking, tragic and witty, and which will ring true with viewers of all demographics.<br/><br/>Centering around two disturbing car accidents, a carjacking, vicious workplace vandalism, and the suspicious shooting death of one police officer by another, the drama is set against the backdrop of a racist LAPD and Los Angeles justice system. Action shifts between the various characters, whose lives collide with each other in unpredictable ways as each faces their own moral dilemma, and tries to cope with the consequences of their resulting decision made or action taken. Each of the dozen or so main characters undergoes some type of a personal metamorphosis as the various story lines head toward a striking, common conclusion, which succeeds at being both cathartic and unsettling.<br/><br/>Crash is backed by a solid and varied, original soundtrack and excellent cinematography. Sweeping, wider shots alternate with disjointed camera angles which convey the chaos and confusion of the characters and the unpredictability of life. Occasional lingering close-ups -- on occasion without sound -- capture the actors' facial expressions, which suitably detail key moments of the characters' aching pain, fear, anger, bitter anguish, remorse or grief, far better than any dialogue could."
"ervin-softic","7","1","4","12 September 2013"," Crash review
","Reviewing the movie Crash is quite a task because it's a complex movie about racism and conflicts. The name Crash is really fitting for this movie because in the movie as Don Cheadles character says ""We crash into each other, just so we can feel something,"". Now this is where the racism and stereotypes come in, there are conflicts everywhere in this movie and everyone collides into each other and this is done in a good way. The cast of the movie is very big, and i mean very big about 10 important people and 20 half important people and the movie is roughly 1 hour and 40 minutes long, and the cast is great. The only problem is that it's to big. The only movie that could ever handle a cast that size is lord of the rings and that movie had about 9 hours to develop their characters. So you end up not caring about most of the characters, for example when Sandra Bullocks character says to her maid that she is her best friend I felt nothing but when Terence Howard's character attacks the police I did feel something because he is the only one i cared for and Terence Howard definitely stole the show. Terence character is a successful man in the movie business and then he gets pulled over and Matt Dillon's character molests his wife while he does nothing, they argue and he goes to work and faces racism there to. Finally he confronts 3 police officers and one of them is Ryan Phillippe's character (he was there when the molesting accrued) and he tells the other two officers that it's OK and he is a friend of his, this scene is perfect and feels somewhat real, you really end up caring about what happens here. In the final scenes of the movie some people get their redemption like Terence character and after all that Ryan Philippe has done he accidentally kills a black man because the thought that he was pulling out a gun, that scene is very powerful and is one of my favorite scenes in the movie. Some people end up good and get their redemption and some people become what they fought against. In conclusion the movie is decent but not Oscar worthy. The racism is badly portrayed and comes off feeling unreal but in some scenes it's done perfectly. Every second in this movie it felt like i was spoon feed about racism for instance Ludicrous character is a robber, but wait are all black people bad? No Terence is a good guy and he is black, the racism in this movie felt like a joke it's so fake i just can't get over it but sometimes they get it right for example when the social worker says her name is Shaniqua, Dillon's character says ""big f*****g surprise there"", i thought bullseye that is real racism and that feels so real and you really think wow this really does happened to some people, racism is subtle and getting that in a movie is not an easy task but if you are gonna do it then do it right. Finally the cast was great but to big if they had less characters they could have made a much better movie and overall i think you should see this movie but don't expect to learn anything about racism just watch it as a drama movie with some flaws."

It is a fact that there are bad people but if one of them is black people or Asian or something else , that doesn't mean that everybody is bad ... But everything can change in a little time.

","There is a huge discrimination and stereotyping in every part of the movie.As a result of this situation many communication problems occur.For example, in the first part of the movie police stops the car just because the driver is black and he blames the couple for doing something illegal. They make them get off the car and one of the police abuses the driver's wife. But what does the man do is nothing. He just watches what is happening. Because he is afraid of being notorious and known as black by others.After going home his wife gets angry because he cannot empathy for her. I think the most important problem is prejudgment. As it is seen in the movie, it causes dead.When a black man gets on to the police's car, he starts to laugh as a result of seeing statue.But police thinks that he is laughing for something else.When he asks why he is laughing, he says nothing. That makes the police suspicious. He stops the car and asks him to get out. In that moment the black guy decides to explain why he is laughing, he puts his hand into his pocket to show him the statue that is the same with his'. The police thinks that he is trying to get his gun. Police takes his gone before him and shoots.

","Crash is a drama co-written, produced, and directed by Paul Haggis. The film is about racial and social tensions in Los Angeles, California wherein several characters' stories interweave.The ensemble cast includes Sandra Bullock,Don Cheadle,Matt Dillon,Jennifer Esposito,Brendan Fraser,Terrence Howard,Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges,Thandie Newton,Ryan Phillippe,Larenz Tate and Michael Peña It was inspired by a real life incident in which his Porsche was carjacked outside a video store on Wilshire Boulevard back in 1991.<br/><br/>Graham is a police detective whose brother is a street criminal, and it hurts him to know his mother cares more about his never-do-well brother than him. Graham's partner is Ria, who is also his girlfriend, though she has begun to bristle at his emotional distance, as well as his occasional insensitivity over the fact he's African-American and she's Hispanic. Rick is an L.A. district attorney whose wife, Jean, makes little secret of her fear and hatred of people unlike herself. Jean's worst imaginings about people of color are confirmed when her SUV is carjacked by two African-American men in Anthony, who dislikes white people as much as Jean hates blacks, and Peter, who is more open minded. Cameron is a well-to-do African-American television producer with a beautiful wife, Christine. While coming home from a party, Cameron and Christine are pulled over by Officer Ryan, who subjects them to a humiliating interrogation while his new partner, Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillippe), looks on. Daniel is a hard-working locksmith and dedicated father who discovers that his looks don't lead many of his customers to trust him. And Farhad is a Middle Eastern shopkeeper who is so constantly threatened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks that he decided he needs a gun to defend his family. <br/><br/>Movie studios, by and large, avoid controversial subjects like race the way you might avoid a hive of angry bees. So it's remarkable that Crash even got made; that it's a rich, intelligent, and moving exploration of the interlocking lives of a dozen Los Angeles residents--black, white, Latino, Asian, and Persian--is downright amazing.This is the rare American film really about something, and almost all the performances are riveting. It asks tough questions, and lets its audience struggle with the answers."

Graham understands their plight; behind closed doors he cares for his sick mother left distraught by his wayward-younger brother, Peter (Larenz Tate), who has left home to pursue a life of crime. Cheadle's performance is outstanding, as he deals with a difficult family and professional life, with the silent-yet-dignified screen presence that he is known for.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton plays Christine, the mixed-race wife of a wealthy television director, who is far removed from life on the streets of downtown LA. Film-maker Paul Haggis wrote this role specifically with Thandie in mind, and her performance doesn't disappoint. Particularly harrowing is the scene with husband Cameron (Terence Howard) after she has been sexually-molested by Officer Ryan during a stop and search. Cameron is forced to watch, left powerless by a police-gun aimed at his head.<br/><br/>Officer Ryan, (Matt Dillon), plays the part of an ignorant racist, whose dialogue is peppered with stereotypes about people of colour. However, his remarks disguise a brutalised, complex-character who manages to elicit the audience's sympathy during the course of the film. In contrast, colleague Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillipe) is naïve and racially-'liberal'. He pays the price for this when his underlying racial-fear gets the better of him, with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>This film is a 'crash' course (excuse the pun) in racism that is very relevant to today's post-September 11th society. The pace of the film is slow at times (particularly in the second half) and often labours the 'racism' point. However, the film's strength is that it doesn't criticise or judge, instead, the audience takes the same emotional journey as the characters as we are also forced to examine our own racial prejudices vicariously."

","I will seldom take time to write about anything I didn't absolutely love or absolutely hate. I'm a self appointed movie critic, who gives almost everything a 6-8 because pretty much everything I see is average (enough to make a movie out of, or at least enough to get the funding for it, or it'd not likely be a movie to begin with nor would I be watching it...but not significant enough that I'd be likely to watch it again). I don't have time to talk about the average movies I've seen, but ones I really love, I want to tell people about. And those I really hate, I want to save at least a few from wasting a precious two hours of their lives for, considering they might otherwise be doing something productive during that time, like mowing their lawn so we don't have to look at it or wonder what's going to come out and grab us as we drive by.<br/><br/>This movie is one of those I really love, particularly given a strong interest in both Sociology and Psychology. The movie itself is largely based around day to day events for random people, but it encompasses many of the stereotypes for each based on today's society...even pulling out some of the tiniest bits of a few typical ideas that people don't consciously realize they hold as the movie unfolds.<br/><br/>It is rare that a movie can take a person through so many emotions in such a short period, and at the same time make even those most set on their opinion about the ""way of the world"" want to change it and make it a better place. The difference in the impact of this movie vs 9/11 in America (outside of one being real and the other a pulling together of non-verified, but real life events) is that the day after 9/11, there seemed to be a coming together of people for a common cause, despite their differences. And after allowing yourself to be engulfed with this movie, there is a wanting to come together in total appreciation of those differences, as opposed to just being in light of them.<br/><br/>Despite it's occasional violence and brief scenes of a sexual nature, I think this is a great movie even for ""mature"" younger audiences. For those who've lost hope in this country (the US), it's an eye opener in that the changing of the pace here, the heightened aggravation and lack of understanding we have in one another is often related to the additional struggles that we all face, as our ""normal"" here has changed so much in such a short period of time. As for the rest...for those who've not lost hope, it's a reminder of why it's not only held onto, but also sought after as the American dream, as well as what so many go through to see it their lifetime. <br/><br/>If you've not yet seen this movie, go get it, because there's something in it for you, no matter who you are."

","Recently I've been going back and re-watching several of the last few Best Picture winners. I know that this film winning was a slight controversy as Brokeback Mountain was expected to win. Munich, other Best Picture nominee, was also a great movie. But I think that Crash deserved the award. Crash has a great storyline and amazing acting.<br/><br/>Crash tells the story of whites, blacks, Latinos, Iranians and Koreans all living in Los Angeles. The interviewing of the separate stories is done very well. There is a black detective (Don Cheadle), a film director (Terrence Howard), a racist housewife (Sandra Bullock), a racist cop (Matt Dillon), a young policeman (Ryan Phillipe), a black woman (Thandie Newton), a shop owner (Shaun Toub), a locksmith (Michael Pena) and a car thief (Ludacris).<br/><br/>All of these stories fit together brilliantly thanks to the director and writer Paul Haggis (In the Valley of Elah, Million Dollar Baby). The locksmith is working for both Bullock and Toub. Howard's girlfriend Newton is molested by Dillon. Phillipe worked with Dillon. It sounds complicated, but it all falls into place as the movie unfolds, it is clear who is who and what their life is like.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis, who is a brilliant scriptwriter, once again hits a home run script. As a director he is also amazing, the film is done with the perfect approach. A lot of the credit goes to the amazingly talented actors and actresses. From many of the actors, such as Matt Dillon, Michael Pena and Thandie Newton, this is their best performance yet. Each actor fits into the role of their character and lives out their problems and how they deal with them on screen. Crash is simply brilliant. I know I tend to review movies positively, but Crash deserves every bit of praise I have given it. Films like Crash are why there are still good actors and good movies. As much as I love big budget action movies, films like Crash will always be first pick in my book."

","Sandra Bullock & Tony Danza head an ensemble diversified cast in this movie set in Christmas time LA. Paul Hagis whose writing work runs the gamut from good in Million Dollar Baby to poor in Quantum Of Solace directs his 7th film here. He wrote the screenplay as well.<br/><br/>While this is a good intense drama which tries to look realistically at racism in a modern diversified LA, it does get too melodically preachy towards the end of the film. It presents many views of racial hate but does not really get deep enough into its characters to show the real meaning from which the hate stems.<br/><br/>The production obviously has some expense thrown into the film and the money shows. At least this is better than some of Hagis other work but when you look at the film as a whole, it is as inconsistent as his resume. Hagis worked on Flags of Our Fathers with Eastwood which is the weaker of the two films (Letters From Iwo Jima being the better other). Million Dollar Baby for all its good stuff, has too much card board in its main characters too.<br/><br/>It appears Hagis work varies depending upon who he is working with. Here where he is on his own, the result is decidedly a mixed bag. There is a lot of drama & meat hung out here through the story lines, but the movie just sort of ends which in a way is like the real world but since there is obviously some contrived stuff here, that ending is not satisfactory for this film. The film dilutes it's main powerful racism message in an effort to be ""politcally correct"" which comes off as melancholy."

I particularly liked the ""soft"" and measured pace of the direction and final editing of the film which completely pulls in the viewer, which was perfectly and outstandingly complemented by the terrific choice of different types of music for the soundtrack throughout. This time as well I felt myself becoming more and more emotionally involved with all of the individual characters and their individual dilemmas in this hardly easy business of being a human being on this modern planet of ours. As before, the scene which really got to my heart and emotions was the traumatic scene in which the Persian shopkeeper ""shoots"" the locksmith's daughter - and doesn't!

","This 2004 Best Picture Oscar winning crime drama from director Paul Haggis tells many tales about racism, crime, families, affairs and love in an intriguing if somewhat exaggerated film with a brilliant cast of actors.<br/><br/>Starring Sandra Bullock (Speed) Don Cheadle (Hotel Rwanda) Thandie Newton (The pursuit of happiness) and Michael Pena, Crash has a credible look from the outside, and as viewers are given multiple stories to digest, it lives up to the star's reputations.<br/><br/>The film justifies the crime genre by focusing strongly upon issues regarded in the media today, particularly racism. Discussed in numerous stories in the film, racism is portrayed negatively and very seriously, none more so than Ludicrous' character who rants about how badly black people are treated, just by what they wear and how they appear to other people. Though you can see the point, it does feel slightly exaggerated. <br/><br/>The way it is talked about by other characters feels very serious and you can feel sorry for some, none more so than Pena's character who has to deal with a whole lot during his story, and his is the best to watch because in all honesty, his protagonist is by far the most intriguing and the one character in the film that was given the most depth and understanding. The scenes with him and his daughter are heart braking, absolute brilliant drama at its best, remarkable and the highlight of the entire film.<br/><br/>The film doesn't feel as strong as it could have been. A few characters could have more depth and the link between them all doesn't feel that strong at the end either.<br/><br/>However it focuses well on the issue in hand, there are great moments of drama involving Pena and Newton's character, Bullock should have been in the film more, it was well directed and despite it's faults, I couldn't tear my eyes away, a watchable and intriguing issue driven drama"

","If this movie is a portrayal of true life in America (and the director says it is in the extra footage), then what a fantastic promotional tool for life anywhere else! I bought this movie because the cast includes the worlds most desirable woman, Sandra Bullock and, to be fair to her, it is an excellent demonstration of her acting talent because her part in this is definitely not typical of her usual character type. In itself, that forced me to rate the movie higher than I would have otherwise done. Maybe the rest of the civilized world will end up like the Los Angeles (City of Angels???) portrayed here but I sure as heck hope it isn't in my lifetime. To be fair to the producers and director, there were some beautiful cameos in the movie - like when the guy gives his little girl the invisible ""protection cape"" and when we see that the red box was blanks (possibly the best bit in the whole movie) - but what about a city where a man can fire a gun at a man and his daughter in broad daylight and no one so much as comes to investigate? What about a city where a police officer can ""feel up"" a respectable woman in front of her husband and get away with it? I could go on but what's the point? Who would be inspired to want to live there? Not me!"
"kausix777","7","1","4","10 February 2008"," Definitely thought provoking but not much of a coincidence
","It's a WELL made movie but I'm not sure if it deserved an Oscar for the best motion picture.<br/><br/>It provides moments of thought-provoking drama. But as another reviewer has noticed, the coincidences including the rescue scene were made up and not entirely coincidental.<br/><br/>A few spoilers here: There are interesting thoughts here - one armed car thief (we don't know this yet) is walking with his partner-in-crime, similarly armed and makes some preposterously racist statements like how large dark windows on buses are racist in nature, about how a black waitress was racist by not offering them coffee and (now, this got me thinking) about how Bullock clung to Fraser as soon as she saw two black men in one of the safest, well-lit and 'white' parts of the town.<br/><br/>His partner is depicted as more rational and least bothered about stereotypes of colour - he clearly explains that the waitress did not offer them coffee because they didn't order any. This conversation could have set the tone for the film. However, many more dialogues were more mellow in nature.<br/><br/>Notice that the 'racist' cop Ryan tries to explain to Shaniqua Johnson as to why he felt bad about the colour thing because of what happened to his father - now, this was an aside to his previously racist character and he ends up saving Christine in a scene that is believable and brings out some good acting from Thandie Newton. Thus, we see characters that are more complex than you or me or rather, those who wear that complexity on their sleeves more often.<br/><br/>Similarly, Bullock's explanation of her fear from the locksmith is also fine but I am not that impressed with her acting in this small role and her character still appeared racist.<br/><br/>Also notice that most of these characters have mixed shades of conscience. Our car thief again is reluctant to rob cars from blacks but ends up saving a bunch of (probably) smuggled south east Asians from the car dealer who was going to sell them, calling them Chinamen.<br/><br/>While many would question Cameron's passiveness in the 'probing' scene, his point is well explained, although not accepted by his wife. I don't think he had any inferiority complexes about being black - he was just scared of the cop who had a gun and appeared ready to frame them.<br/><br/>Cut to the lovemaking scene: Detective Graham is making love with his partner of El Salvador / Puerto Rican origin thinking she's Mexican and telling his mother she's white to anger her. This was a bit overdone, in my opinion. This one was not necessary.<br/><br/>Other racial prejudices brought out are: Persians being called Arab (now I would not like to comment on how the Arab-Persian world sees the rest of the world). Also, note that the Persian guy, himself a victim of racism while buying a gun, is also racist in behaviour when it comes to assuming that the black locksmith was behind the robbery of his shop. This part is interesting as it clearly shows that victims of racism, including blacks in the movie, are racist in their own right. Incidents like these are just there to make you think.<br/><br/>No real solutions are suggested in the film except fleeting hints at humanity and the coincidence (this was real) that the white officer Hansen and the black car thief carried the same statues for their cars - people of all 'colours' could like the same things."

","While the Academy Award-show was being prejudiced against ""Brokeback Mountain"" due to it's homosexual themes and controversial nature, this film honestly isn't that different then the other so the ""Best Picture"" award should have done to something else that was good, but not like the other two.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is writer/producer Paul Haggis's ( Casino Royale(2006); recent Clint Eastwood films) first theatrical film that he directed and his co-written screenplay is one of the most complex, yet extremely intriguing concepts ever put on film. <br/><br/>The movie basically deals with racism, the people in L.A. who experience it and, ironically, are all somewhat related to each other. It wisely gives each race an decent, but equal amount of screen time and no one ever feels left out of this, thus anyone can watch it and get something out of it and not be restricted by it's message and/or the marketing audience.<br/><br/>About all the races are looked at: the Hispanics, the Asians, the Blacks, even the Persians! The music is gorgeously beautiful and fits the tone perfectly. The movie is sad, but not too depressing to where it will make the viewer want to turn it off.<br/><br/>The actors consist of currently popular screen-names ( like Don Cheadle and Sandra Bullock), upcoming stars who almost steal the show ( Michael Pena, Ryan Phillipe, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton and Terrence Dashon Howard ), character actors who are always recognized by their familiar faces and roles ( Larentz Tate and William Fichtner ) as well as other ""well- known's"" making brief appearances that aren't really cameos ( Keith David and Brendan Frasier ).<br/><br/>This is one of the best ""all-star"" cast, controversial and thought-provoking films ever produced!

","Dillon was at his best in this movie. I have watched him grow as an actor, and I must say, he deserved to win the awards he did for this film. His character was not the least bit shallow or dull in ""Crash."" Yes, I know, some of the scenes were predictable, but you must remember what movies are all about. They are about how well a person can carry off a character even acting to a poorly written plot. In my opinion, I liked the plot. Dillon's character may have been unlikable in the beginning, but aren't we all a bit like that? We all have our weaknesses and prejudices, and we can keep them or turn them into strengths. Good job, Matt!! I love you and you are right up there with Anthony Hopkins in my opinion. You've made it, dear! Sandra Bullock said it perfectly when she said, ""If you don't see a little of yourself identifying with at least one of the characters, then you're a liar."" Oh, and by the way, if you don't agree with my comment, try hard not to click no. If everyone does that without reading it, then that is when it gets to be pretty scary! Freedom of speech???

"Brian11785","7","1","4","24 July 2007"," Well....
","Like Titanic before it, Best Picture-winning Crash has become a punching bag for movie snobs. While about as subtle as a series of left jabs from Hilary Swank, Paul Haggis's ensemble race drama is a watchable effort with some fine acting and a few truly moving moments.<br/><br/>I think Crash's biggest problem is that it tries too hard, often sacrificing believable dialogue and characters for the clever, preachy and faux-profound varieties. Aside from a few miscasts (Encino Man as the L.A. district attorney?), the actors are able to rise above the overly...scripty script. Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard give standout performances.<br/><br/>But my favorite characters, the films least clichéd, are the Hispanic locksmith and his daughter. My favorite scene in the film is probably the only one not centered around race: the one in which he comes home late from work and gives her an invincibility cloak that will protect her from neighborhood gunfire. It's a tender moment amidst the heavyhandedness.<br/><br/>Is there much about Crash that is hard-hitting, bold or over-the-top thought-provoking? In 2005, not really.<br/><br/>But I still liked it."
"fullonrobotchubby","7","1","4","19 April 2007"," Best Picture... seemed like a good idea at the time.
","""Wow. This movie has guts and a brain to match with it. The tragedies that can be caused by even a slight sample of prejudice are showcased in full light, especially with Ryan Phillippe's cop in a nightmarish link to the characters' connections. Breakout performances can be found by Michael Pena (an actor I'll keep my eye on for the future), Terrence Howard (very good actor - can't wait to see Hustle & Flow), and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges (that's right, THAT Luda). No one in the cast dominates the screen more than Matt Dillon, who plays an extremely racist cop with a sick father and, in my favorite scene, must rescue a black woman he took advantage of earlier from certain death. My only complaint that keeps the movie from receiving that last half of a star is the fact that while this seems like it should be a fairly balanced script for the ensemble, some actors (like Brendan Fraser) played characters who didn't seem as pivotal to the plot and shined less. Also, to those of you playing ""Where's Danza?"" look here."" <br/><br/>This is what I wrote when I first saw Crash, when it first came out on DVD. This was before its now infamous Oscar-win over Brokeback Mountain for Best Picture of 2005. At the time, I gave it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars (9 out of 10 here)....<br/><br/>.... I still think the film is slightly better than the pretty-yet-credit-greedy Brokeback Mountain (not the first homosexual romance film, folks!), but I see its win for Best Picture merely as a desperate attempt at ending racism once and for all - not a reward for an extraordinarily crafted film. Crash is a good film, Paul Haggis is a terrific writer, and the cast did what they could (As it turns out, my favorite scene, the only one that stands out to me, is Pena putting his daughter to bed), but its aura - its very being - is just not as lasting as anticipated.<br/><br/>I don't blame the Academy at all for their choice; I was even on the same boat. How comfortable would it be to live in a world where we would no longer feel the need to remind each other that racism is an ugly thing? Of course it would feel fantastic! At the time, handing out one of the most established and prestigious prizes this country has to offer to a film like Crash felt like a brilliant, society-improving move. We Crash-lovers all thought that hopefully, giving Best Picture to Crash will end that constant obligation we all feel, and no more movies, books, TV shows, etc. about racism will ever have to be made again! This mark in history, this ""Oscar upset,"" when Jack Nicholson announces the winner, THIS will change everything, right?...<br/><br/>Unfortunately no.<br/><br/>To be blunt (and this is coming from an Oscar-holic), none of the Best Picture nominees were all that amazing. My favorite among them was Capote, but I realize it's not the most amazing of films...<br/><br/>2005 was a year fueled by political frustration (Syriana, Munich, Good Night, and Good Luck., the Oscar telecast was even hosted by Jon Stewart!). I normally never side with the family-friendly genre, but through all that opinionated muck, I found my favorite film of 2005 to be March of the Penguins. (Sigh) At least it won Best Documentary."
"Percivalx","8","1","4","15 April 2007"," Crash Is A Hit
","There seems to be a lot backlash against Crash. It may not have been the most deserving Best Picture winner, but I still think it's a very good film. It tells an interesting story with solid writing, acting, cinematography, and editing. For starters, the screenplay is structurally very good. Paul Haggis does a great job of connecting the stories resulting in powerful, dramatic payoffs for each character. Some scenes are gut-wrenching with emotion which moved me to tears. Matt Dillon rescuing Thandie Newton from the car wreckage and Michael Pena's little girl jumping into his arms as the gun goes off are the two most memorable scenes in the movie. The score is haunting with Bird York's In the Deep single being a beautiful addition. Most of the actors do very well. Dillon, Newton, Pena, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard and Sandra Bullock stand out. The rest are debatable. Brendan Fraser's performance, in particular, is wooden at best. At times the dialogue can be stilted and unnatural, but the overall film is engaging and thought provoking."
"zell1290","8","1","4","28 March 2007"," Moving and thought-provoking.
","The writer of Million Dollar Baby, Paul Haggis returns with this arguably the best film of the last half a decade. Crash is a stunning and powerful depiction of modern day life in Los Angeles under the racist LAPD judicial system. The narrative follows several characters from different racial backgrounds as their lives intertwine and the prejudices each one holds for other races are rocked to their very foundations.<br/><br/>The conflicts encountered by the various characters reflect many of the issues that affect our society today such as a white police officer stopping a black man and his wife for 'DWB' ('driving while black'). Crash takes a long, hard look at the white authoritarian members of society and their racism but also looks at it from the point of view of those who are victims of such racism. The result pulls the audience through a cathartic journey that will leave all who see it with the opportunity to give racism a serious thought.<br/><br/>The acting, especially from the film's central characters never ceases to amaze as the audience bears witness to some stunning performances, especially Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon. Crash gave its actors the opportunity to really show off their considerable talent, which many of them did.<br/><br/>The music in Crash contributes a great deal to its overall effect. With few exceptions, the score is mellow but powerful and serves to give each scene the strength to convey that part of the story.<br/><br/>Featuring a star-studded cast including Don Cheadle, Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges and Matt Dillon, Crash is a complex and riveting tale of a group of individuals that face colossal changes and choices that will put their strength to the test. Crash has won many awards recently including piping Brokeback Mountain for the Oscar for 'Best Film'. This film is not overrated and is arguably the best film to be released for a long time. Akin in many respects to '21 Grams' and 'Magnolia' the complexity of the characters and story will hold the audience to the screen for two hours of cinematic brilliance."
"agaram","Null","1","4","14 March 2007"," Review about the movie Crash
","The movie Crash shows in different stories about Indians, Mexicans and also Blacks the various kinds of racism not just minorities all over the world are contending with. In this film also the Blacks condemn the Whites. Sometimes it seems Paul Haggisdidn't know how to combine the various story lines and so the links seem a little bit artificial. Nevertheless the movie conveys the feelings of the characters in a very good way. So everyone is able to understand the motives the Iranian shopkeeper has and that he wants to revenge on the person who caused his misfortune. Such moments, when somebody is thinking about his life(and the way it goes), are underlined by emotional music. This music is also meant to inspire the viewers to think about similar situations in their lives and about the way they reacted. Another important aspect 'Crash' pays attention to is that just a single moment is enough to change your whole life and your personality. Good people become evil and vice versa. All in all Ipersonally like the movie 'Crash', especially its critics of society and the distance between people."
"bj91621","10","1","4","7 December 2006"," Best film of the year
","""Crash"" was the best movie that I have had see in 2005. It reminded me of all the movies that I had recently seen that involved racial discrimination and prejudice outlaws. Everyone in this movie scores, including the crew. The film helps us to see that we, as people are victims of racism, and are guilty of it. I see Crash as a distinct supplement of what everyday people have to endure through common prejudice issues. The movie really depicts these common issues really well, thoroughly, and harshly. It is a very, very true movie, and whoever sees this picture, will endure into it, as much as I have because we all fall short into this discrimination, but we should never disgrace ourselves to it."
"cowboytt88","9","1","4","5 December 2006"," An American Triumph
","Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" is a triumph of a movie, and it is not without obstacles. It has a mundane plot and dialog that lacks subtly. Yet the superb acting and multitude of provocative questions the film asks its audience to ponder is nothing short of remarkable as it is remarkably important. The cast is exhilarating, particularly Sandra Bullock as a snooty house wife, Matt Dillon as a racist police cop, and especially Thandie Newton as a distraught lady caught in between having to conform to the subtle nature of racism in contemporary LA and the racism Dillon's character inflicts upon her. ""Crash"" won the Academy Award for Best Picture and I was happy it did so. Unlike ""Brokeback Mountain,"" another great film, ""Crash"" has a redeeming ending and gives the characters a new sense of definition for their life. To be sure, it is upsetting but not without reason. Definitely worth seeing if you haven't done so already. This one is for the shelf.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"movieratings03","Null","1","4","2 October 2006"," I Like The Title
","CRASH **** The economical and cultural diversity in a Los Angelos setting, showcasing the reality of it's existence worldwide, is taken to potent levels in Paul Haggis's Oscar-winning monument. You'll recognize familiar faces cast as some of the film's broad range of characters who are either dealing with racist-stricken situations, discovering the importance human decency has on society or becoming aware of the virtues society may seem to miss. It comprises of a couple of the most heart-wrenching, emotional scenes of cinema I have ever witnessed to be honest, and that is partly why I recommend you watch it. Pay attention to all of the story's tidbits, because the story becomes progressively more interesting and stimulating as they are reintegrated. Definitely worth looking into."
"ilikeimdb","7","1","4","29 May 2006"," I hear false sentiment ringing / crashing everywhere
","I have issues with this movie.<br/><br/>Crash has two absolutely superb scenes that sealed its Academy Award (the car crash rescue and the locksmith daughter shooting) and many other riveting and highly contrived but well-directed ""crashes"". Yes, contrived, overwrought, and largely unbelievable. Ridiculous interactions designed for maximum emotional impact. This movie doesn't teach us anything about real race relations and I didn't find its confessional style to be anything more than convenient crutches for artificial conflict. The absurdities boggle the mind (extremely/overly literate car jackers, a DA's wife who throws racially tinged vitriol designed to unelect her husband, a producer's seemingly intelligent but down-on-the-boner wife who thinks her husband could somehow magically handle the well-armed LAPD (better speak to Rodney King!) and his equally unbelievable 180 degree turnaround with a gun in his face...the list goes on and on).<br/><br/>This whole movie resembles Pulp Fiction in feel and incongruity, except that Crash takes its subject matter far too seriously (a mistake *not* made by Q. Tarantino) and Crash bloviates its subject matter like a miasmic Santa Ana.<br/><br/>Yet, I can see why this won Best Picture over Brokeback Mountain, for that movie, too, rings its own falsehoods, but much more quietly. Had just the directors been reversed, Brokeback would have turned into an amazingly (and much more interesting) campy romp/slutfest and Ang Lee would have won more academy awards that should be possible."
"boyinflares","7","1","4","23 May 2006"," Interesting, unique film
","When all the hype revolving around ""Crash"" finally settled down, I thought it best if I finally rent the DVD to see for myself what this award-winning film is about. A lot of people had said it was very good, and being set in a post-9/11 environment intrigued me. However, while it was a very, very good film, it didn't quite grab me. I understand that it was probably supposed to leave a strange cold-feeling inside you after watching it, but I guess I just wasn't prepared for it.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is intense to say the least, and I'm not talking about the large cast and multiple story lines running alongside each other, but the overall narrative of the film is at times hard to take in at times. It definitely helps watching this if you know a bit about why various races do not like each other for whatever reasons they have. The content of the film is filled with offensive language, drug use, violence of almost every sort imaginable, and so on, and at times, makes for a very sad and depressing film.<br/><br/>That is lifted however thanks to the outstanding cast. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, Don Cheadle, Ryan Phillippe, Jennifer Espsito, Ludicrous, Brendan Fraser, Michael Pena and Terrance Howard are all stand out in their leading roles, but in particular Dillon, Phillippe, Newton and Pena. The spectacular Nona Gaye has a small role as the assistant to Brendan Fraser's character, Loretta Devine is as usual great in her small role, Daniel Dae Kim and Tony Danza make small appearances, as does the graceful Marina Sirtis (Deanna Troi from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation), and although the character she played seemed far too old for her, it is great to see Sirtis acting still, and that she hasn't lost any of her compassion.<br/><br/>Overall, a interesting, unique film, that (I'll admit) at times was lost on me, but it makes for a very thought-provoking film and the cast are all terrific."

","CRASH is a great movie that can become a ""classic"" if the use of unnecessary profanity is edited out.

The acting performances were very good. The script had too much ""research lecturing""; however, given the unorthodox creativity of the script and the screenwriter's agenda, it all fitted in.

CRASH is the ""societal Xray"" we all need to see and analyze."
"rmax304823","7","1","4","2 April 2006"," Through a glass darkly.
","What ""Traffic"" did for drugs, ""Crash"" tries to do for race relations, and to a lesser extent succeeds.<br/><br/>The crash of the title, presumably, refers to the offensive behavior of ethnic groups and races to one another. But behavior must be justified, and the justification here (as in life) evolves from the prism through which we view society. As our sensitivity to tribal allegiances is heightened, so we tend to heighten it even more in a kind of vicious circle at the end of which the evil nature of the ""other"" can simply be taken for granted.<br/><br/>The movie does a pretty good job of showing how this distorted vision evolves, sometimes out of practically nothing. I guess I'll give an illustration of what I'm getting at. I'm white and my friend was African-American. This was in Philadelphia in the early 70s, when urban crime was rampant. On payday we cashed our checks, first at his bank, then at mine. I stood around in his bank awkwardly waiting for him, nervously imagining that the armed guards were eying me suspiciously as a potential bank robber, since I seemed to have no business being there. I said nothing about it to Bill because it seemed silly. Then we went through the same business at my bank except that this time Bill was left to loll around. When we were outside, he told me, ""You know, I think those guards were all keeping an eye on me because I'm black."" Racism, as it's usually called, is probably our most profound social problem and it is rarely talked about because it makes for clumsy conversation between members of opposite groups. But, as this movie makes clear, the prejudice is not entirely without justification. Prejudice seldom is. Abrasions, major and minor, build up animosities until individuals explode with anger or reach too quickly for the gun.<br/><br/>""Crash"" gives us a good picture of the way prejudice insinuates itself into our lives, often without our realizing it. Not that the movie is flawless. Compared to ""Traffic,"" the seams show. The interlocking stories are rather mechanically spelled out for us. And instead of focusing on three stories, there are multiple narratives involving -- let me think -- whites, Iranians, African-Americans, Cambodians, Chinese, and Mexican-Americans. Absolutely nobody gets along with anybody else. And there is no figure who is able to transcend these animadversions. Don Cheadle could do it in ""Traffic"" but his character can't do it here. And Sandra Bulluck is in this movie for reasons not immediately apparent to a viewer. The ending of the movie is hyped by a lugubrious score that shows us all of the major figures suffering, although we need neither the score nor the montage to tell us the fate of characters that the movie has spent all of its time spelling out in detail for us.<br/><br/>Yet the movie carries more weight than most. It's more literal than it needs to be but its message is so important that it can't, and shouldn't be, ignored.<br/><br/>Where does this abominable sentiment come from, this racism that Gunnar Myrdal saw right of the boat or the bat? Maybe the answer is as sad as the movie's ending. ""We have seen the enemy,"" said Pogo, ""and he is us."""

","At first I nearly walked out- I love thought provoking movies- but with this I just felt preached at. And not in a subtle manner! But it did improve! The characters evolved to be a (little) more than one-dimensional. But only a little. As all that really happened was each character was shown doing something good as well as something bad!! (wow how deep!) Also, though I have not been to LA, I cannot believe everyone is that racist or shallow. I could not find one redeeming character in the whole film. Now I realise this is probably the point- but sorry I prefer a little more optimism and faith in humanity.<br/><br/>Nevertheless the film DOES have merits. It is wonderfully directed, acted and shot. It also brings a necessary debate to the fore. However this aspect is let down- due to the movie feeling a little smug and self satisfied.<br/><br/>I would rate this as an interesting, if clumsily handled film.

","Hate actually is all around. For those that have seen ""Love Actually"", you get where I'm going. The movie ""Love Actually"" took huge cast of different characters and portrayed how love effects each of them. This movie does the same and the opposite, it takes a huge cast of characters and shows how hate effects them. Hate manifests itself in this movie most often as racism. Everyone, to a degree, is racist, and this movie will help you to see that in yourself, and possibly do something about it, or at least for a little bit. By that I mean that the events in the movie slap you in the face, and the fingerprints don't go away too quickly. The casting and the way the stories mingle together were composed wonderfully. Aside from the jarring social realizations, the movie is very easy to watch and follow. My only critique is that the barrage of hate you witness early on in the film turns you off more than it does draw you quickly into the lives of the characters you come to know better."

But, to be frank, to me that is part of the film's charm.<br/><br/>There are several spine-chilling scenes in the film that really had me go ""no no, don't let this happen"". Some of these scenes have a sad outcome, while others have a surprising ""my..., that was close""-ending. Especially the scene in which the little girl runs up to her dad, who's looking right into the gun of an ""unsatisfied"" customer. The subsequent realization that the bullets were blanks almost felt like my doctor had just told me that I'm not terminally ill. I know it would have been more ""daring film-making"" if the little girl had died in her father's arms, but still, I'm really thankful that that particular scene ends the way it does.<br/><br/>I particularly liked Matt Dillon's performance in this film. I think he really is an underrated actor; I'd like to see much more of him in the future. And finally, as part of a dying ""Dutch Trekkie""-race, I was pleasantly surprised that Marina Sirtis had a small role in this film.<br/><br/>Anyway, good stuff! Looking forward to watching the film a second time! Greetings, Stephan Lodewijks from The Netherlands"

","Crash is a well-made, extremely well-acted (Dillon, Cheadle, Pena, Ludicrous especially) ensemble movie that inevitably brings to mind such multi-stranded efforts as Magnolia, Traffic and the best of Robert Altman. <br/><br/>However, it has been over-hyped as a movie that tears down taboos and doublethink, exposing the prejudice and inhumanity of modern L.A. Well, perhaps if the audience lived on the moon. The general message seems to be that most people, of all races are prejudiced or self-serving or both, but most of them have redeeming features as well. Duh. So a bored, rich housewife gets annoyed with the Hispanic maid. So a young, criminal black man gets tied up with conspiracy theories. So an Iranian guy who loses his shop goes a bit crazy. Nothing wrong with these, but to define Crash as brave or shocking is really overstating the case.<br/><br/>There are shocking moments (the stand-off involving the shopkeeper, the locksmith and his daughter); the young, upright cop's moment of panic; but they don't really tell us anything we don't already know. People are flawed. Well, who knew?"
"FilmOtaku","7","1","4","20 June 2005"," Nothing light about this film
","First time director Paul Haggis takes on the powerful subject of race relations in his film ""Crash"", set over the course of 36 hours in Los Angeles. Featuring a large and exceptional ensemble cast, the characters in ""Crash"" all have something to do with one another, even if the familiarity is slight, and most of them have serious racial prejudice issues. Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) is the uptight wife of Los Angeles D.A. Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), who become victims of a car jacking. The perpetrators, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) are habitual criminals who, when they aren't stealing cars for profit, are waxing philosophic on the state of discrimination for African-Americans, though generally it is Anthony who is expounding while Peter negates some of his theories. Sgt. Ryan (Matt Dillon) is on the LAPD and quickly establishes his opinions on race when he pulls over African-American television director Cameron (Terrence Dashon Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) and proceeds to feel her up, much to the horror of his partner, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillippe). Det. Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are lovers who have to deal with their differences as well as the family baggage carried by Waters. Iranian-immigrant, Farhad (Shaun Toub) has to deal with break-ins at this small store, his sole bread and butter, as well as race-related attacks, while his daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh), who is more Americanized, tries to keep him hinged while struggling with the racism herself. Finally, there is Daniel (Michael Pena), a locksmith who looks like a gang member, but is actually the most peaceful and ""nice"" one of the bunch. He is struggling with keeping his family safe, particularly his young daughter, after having lived in a neighborhood in which a stray bullet ripped through her bedroom.<br/><br/>Obviously, the cast list is huge as is the scope of the story, but the bottom line is that everyone is brought together by a series of events that causes each of them to either have their lives physically changed, or causes them to reexamine themselves. Racial prejudice are the two main words to describe the theme of this film, and no race is left untouched by Haggis. I think that this film toes a very narrow line between heavy-handedness and abject relevancy, but the script is so damn good that it is more the latter than the former. I heard a review of this film by Henry Rollins who said that it was a really good film, but that ""he knew all of this already, so he didn't learn anything new"". I agree with this to some extent; anyone who is not racially prejudiced could conceivably find the film a little much at times, as I did. However, Haggis' writing is fantastic and thorough. There are few, if any loose ends, and any kind of ""redemption"" of any of the characters isn't handled in a cheesy manner befitting an old-time radio show or something. (""I know I was wrong, but dagnabbit, I see the light now!"") Nothing like that. Everything that happens has been solidly established and is very believable.<br/><br/>The cast is, quite simply, brilliant. There were people whose acting I didn't have a prior opinion of just because of lack of exposure, who made me sit up and take notice, (Ludacris, Howard) there were actors who are always good that continued to showcase their talent, (Cheadle, Fraser) and there were actors who I really don't like at all who surprised me with their range (Bullock, Phillippe). Haggis' direction is stylish and a little grainy, but it is clear that he is more of a writer than a director; this is not a slam on his directorial style, but the film's style was subtle and more befitting of showcasing the script and action. Haggis, the writer of the Oscar-winning film ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not going to win any honors for being a writer of upbeat films, but his films, while usually pretty heavy and a little depressing are not of the same caliber of pain as say, the work of Todd Solondz. I definitely would recommend this film because I think it is an important societal commentary, I just suggest that the viewer give the film a chance before declaring it to be too heavy or preachy, because I think you may be pleased with the final result. 7/10 --Shelly"

","Crash, co-written and directed by Paul Higgis (Million Dollar Baby) is anything but forgettable. Overflowing with speech that reeks of social realism and a plot that shines with creativity, Crash seamlessly carries multiple narratives which follow the clashing lives of various races of people in L.A. The plot is intriguing in its complexity as an endless cycle of racist vengeance unfolds. With no concern for its appropriateness or political correctness, the film fearlessly heats racial issues to a boil. Even with an ensemble cast ,saturated with talent, Crash lacks definitive heroes, victories, triumphs or failures. Co-writers Higgis and Bobby Moresco somehow manage to depict realistic, predictable characters in a completely unpredictable series of events.<br/><br/>The film is set into motion when Peter (Terrence Howard) and the smart-mouth, prone to preaching Anthony (played by Ludicrous) execute a car-jacking on the L.A. District Attorney and his wife (Fraser and Bullock). Having had their sense of security jarred, they decide to have their locks changed by Hispanic locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena), who also replaces the lock of Arabic shop-owner, Farhad, who buys a gun to help cope with the post 9/11 racism with which he is burdened. The plot's depth unravels itself amongst Asian immigrants, politicians, corrupt police officers, and even a film director (Terrence Howard), as Crash lays out its gritty social commentary on the detachment between the races in Los Angeles. The sharp speech of the characters is brash and intentionally offensive while serving its purpose of thought-provocation. For example, there is Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), a corrupt white policeman who molests the wife of the black film director, Cameron, who's wife, Christine, castigates him for not being ""black enough"" to fight for his wife's honor. Cameron, in turn, releases his frustrations on Anthony during an ensuing car-jacking which is stopped by Officer Ryan's young partner on the force, Officer Hanson (Ryan Phillipe). Yet, the tangled prejudices of all the characters emerge in a beautiful conclusion.<br/><br/>""We just kept digging at the truth, and we just didn't care what it sounded like. And, we knew it was ugly"" states co-writer Bobby Moresco. ""And then, we just didn't allow ourselves to be put off by the ugliness of it. Racism is nothing if not ugly. And no one's going to pay any attention to the storytelling if you try to get around that."" The inappropriateness of which Moresco speaks manifests itself via the lucid acting of the film's breakthroughs. Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges defies the stereotypical rapper turned actor whose range is limited to an on screen version of himself. Ludicrous exhibits a spark of true acting talent, spitting out lines which denounce the even the pop-rap that made him famous-- ""the music of the oppressor"" as his character, Anthony, puts it. Meanwhile, Sandra Bullock, Matt Dillon, and Don Cheadle all display exactly why they're big-time Hollywood talents.<br/><br/>The economic screenplay cleverly weaves in and out of many intense confrontations while also finding time for comical one-liners and softer emotional moments (scored beautifully by Mark Isham). As it does so, the story allows us to receive and understand the prejudice-producing outlooks and anger by which the film and its characters are fuelled. It is in this aspect that Crash is amazing in its ability to transcend the streets of L.A. The fearless racial conflicts portrayed in this film are bound to conjure self-reflection as Crash boldly explores the dangerous places where most films dare not journey. There are many moments when the film could end, but it continues to push further in it's mind-blowing climax, adding spontaneity to its profoundness. Crash surpasses pure entertainment and becomes an important social critique when not a beautiful reflective work of art. You will leave this film ruminating over it's scenes, pondering your place in the feuds depicted on screen, and as Officer Ryan puts it, ""you think you know who you are. You have no idea."""
"TheMovieMark","8","2","15","6 May 2005"," An examination of fear and bigotry from multiple perspectives ensues.
","An angry housewife and her successful District Attorney husband. A Persian store owner. Two police detectives (a black male and a Puerto Rican female) with a complex relationship. A black television director and his wife. A Mexican locksmith with a young daughter. Two car-jackers. A rookie cop. A jaded cop who's seen so much on the force that he's lost his way. A middle-aged Korean couple...<br/><br/>They're all part of the racial diversity that colors Los Angeles. They're all searching for answers, they're all moving forward, they're all coming together, they're all falling apart, and in the next 36 hours they will all collide. <br/><br/>JOHNNY'S TAKE <br/><br/>""You think you know who you are? You have no idea.""<br/><br/>Those words, spoken by Matt Dillon to Ryan Phillippe, are probably the most poignant of the movie. Not only do some of the characters not know who they are, but the audience doesn't even know. Crash does an ingenious job of forcing the viewer to confront his own prejudices by presenting us with characters and causing us to develop our perception of them, but then as the layers are stripped away, we start to realize that perspective can change. We all have our prejudices whether we want to admit it or not, and one or two actions will immediately shape our opinion of these characters. But do those actions completely define the character?<br/><br/>Suspected reprehensible characters are slowly revealed to have a little more depth to them than we initially expect. Matt Dillon is painted as a bigoted, sexist cop. His early actions are indeed reprehensible, but we soon realize there's more to him than our first impression. The years have torn away at him as he's had to take care of his ailing father without being able to get adequate medical care. There's a reason he's turned so bitter, and when his humanity is put to the test, in one of the most powerful scenes in the movie, will he realize the hope that is within him? Nobody is beyond redemption.<br/><br/>Then there's Ludakris (who does a surprisingly good job) who wants to blame everything on racism. He's so blinded by hate that he blames poor service at a restaurant on racism despite the fact that his waitress was black. When his friend (Tate) points this out, Ludakris argues that she has been manufactured by white people to believe in the stereotype that black people don't tip. He's a street thug whose idea of nobility is stealing only from white people. His reasoning? Stealing from other black people is just a sign of cowardice towards whites. Of course, that so-called ""nobility"" is later put to the test. Is he beyond redemption? Or is there hope?<br/><br/>You'll also learn that nobody's halo shines too brightly. Just when you're starting to feel sorry for a character that appears to be a victim, you'll soon see they're just as capable of breaking the IL' Golden Rule as those who have wronged them. If you're going to accept the idea that nobody is beyond redemption, then you have to accept that nobody is beyond reproach either.<br/><br/>You think you know who you are? You have no idea. At least not until your character and humanity are put to the test. Holding onto a set of ideals and dreams is admirable, but actually living out those ideals and dreams is what defines you. True character is displayed through actions. And reactions. We're all searching for answers, we're all moving forward, we're all coming together, we're all falling apart, and our paths may one day collide. Whatever the circumstances may be, the way we act and react to that collison is what's important. <br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>Crash is a strongly-written, strongly-acted, emotionally-gripping, thought-provoking movie that never gets as preachy as you may fear. I could add a few more hyphenated words, but I think you get the point. Some of the stereotypes are exaggerated for effect, but this is a movie that combines just the right amount of humor with some very tense drama to force us to take a close look at how we view others. Is it really fair to blame everything on racism? Sometimes we may unfairly assess a person's character based on his or her appearance, but is that borne of prejudice or is it just a matter of being overly cautious in a world where it's hard to trust those you don't know? Actions speak loudly, but so do our reactions.<br/><br/>This is probably a little too heavy for younger audiences and a little too dark for anybody who just wants to escape from the world for a couple of hours, but for those of you who want a bit of dramatic storytelling then Crash serves up one of this year's best. <br/><br/>Rating: 4.25 (out of 5)"

","Racist ? Mindless ? Unrealistic ?<br/><br/>I recommend this to "" everyone "" when I know that some will mot like it . It's also a fact that this movie is a slice from real life , which is why some people who can't believe these things happen and some other who have mistaken symbols for force , have disliked this . Pointing fingers to this film-makers isn't by any chance going to deny that this doesn't happen in the world and symbols authenticate the meaning in every way possible .<br/><br/>Very surprisingly , this movie discusses all the following ( and more ):<br/><br/>1- A very neglected face of racism , which is anger . Movies like "" 12 years a slave "" discussed racism from the view point that whites felt superior to blacks because they were raised to believe so , and even in Django Unchained , they backed it up with some fake scientific evidence . But here , some people are angry and uncomfortable in their lives . They bash it out in the form of racism , but also in other forms too if you paid a closer look to their lives . This was a very important theme in the story line of Jean Cabot ( Sandra Bullock ) . She accused the handyman "" of color "" ( Michael Pena ) of being a gangster when he himself , was repetitively offended and terrorized in his own life despite of being a very gentle , polite and loving person . She was mean to her housekeeper "" of color too "" although she was the one who eventually saved her . And through out those two actions , you can see the real heart of humanity . The hug between Jean and her housekeeper was really beautiful and said a lot about how human beings should always stand together and leave all this mindless racism behind . Also discussed in the Persian man's story line , where his anger , caused by everyone calling him an Arab and throwing him accusations , plus a personal incidence , led him to almost kill a human being , belonging to a minority too , who had completely nothing to do with the injustice and prejudice the Persian man's had met . <br/><br/>2- There's no such thing called "" Black And White "" . Human beings are like packages . The man who stole your car is a thief , but that's not his life-label . He's a thief at that situation , but he's a father at home , maybe more loving and caring than you are . Maybe he had done a lot of good in his life and this was his big mistake or downfall . This is discussed more than perfectly in Officer Ryan ( Matt Dillon )'s story line when , at first , all you can do is hate him for being that racist to the receptionist ( who turned out to be another racist after all , speaking of hidden racists , there's also the Chinese man's wife ) and even sexually assaulting a woman in that way , but at the same time , he's a man who cares so much for his sick father and would never leave him alone . He would do anything to make him feel better . He's a policeman who risked his own life to rescue another human being . Yes , he's been a racist , but we should never condemn people even if they made mistakes because we're no Gods , and because we may never know the other side of the story and because we may never know what other things this person does in life . We all make mistakes and we're all flawed .<br/><br/>3- Politics , and how dirty they can get sometimes , playing with the race card when the race is sometimes has nothing to do with anything going on . Perfectly discussed in Officer Hansen ( Phillip ) 's storyline , who's white , as he killed a black guy , not out of any spiteful feelings , but as a mistake trying to defend himself . It's debatable , but it still has nothing to do with racism . Maybe the other accidents shown in the movie had to do with racism ( as the two black young men stealing the car at first ) and maybe not ( the previously mentioned one with Officer Hansen ), but we may never know the truth because of how dirty politicians can be and how they are too afraid to tell the truth . A strong wake-up call to be honest at all times .<br/><br/>4- Many times , humans act disgustingly towards each other and are the real racists to their kind . Perfectly discussed in the Asian man's thread .<br/><br/>5- How we're all affected by each other , and how our lives intertwine . Discussed through the whole movie . It may also give you insight to why people do what they do .<br/><br/>6- How we should never believe in stereotypes , because they are not true . People who believe in stereotypes are the ones who make it true sometimes , in their own lives .<br/><br/>It's a piece of art that it's really entertaining and a slice of real life . It doesn't belong to those "" artistic but complicated to understand "" genres . These things also happen and are inspired by true life . Look around and think well . An applause to everyone who participated in this beauty . The acting ( I was amazed by Don Cheadle's in specific ) , screenplay , soundtrack , direction and editing were all marvelous . Thank you for bringing such insights into people's lives ."

I was angry with myself for watching this movie too late. The message of the film and the combination was perfect. When i was watching i was looking forward to the end of the film.

","Crash begins with Graham Walters (Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) getting into a nighttime fender bender. Graham mumbles ""We crash into each other so we can feel something."" Walters is a police detective on his way to investigate a murder. Someone's body was found on the side of the highway.<br/><br/>Crash exposes racial prejudice in the United States with a variety of characters. They include the following: two young black male criminals, an Iranian convenience store owner and his daughter who is a doctor, a Latin locksmith and his 5-year old daughter, two white, male police officers, a black detective and his Hispanic partner, a successful black Hollywood director and his wife, a Korean couple, a black health insurance employee and a white district attorney and his white wife. It is a story about the collision of races, cultures and classes. Each character is a victim of racism and in turn guilty of racism in some way.<br/><br/>Two young black men, Peter and Anthony, are strolling down the busy, well-to-do boulevard and are watching the affluent district attorney and his wife (Jean). Peter says to Anthony, ""We're the only black people, surrounded by a sea of over-caffeinated white people â€“ why aren't we the scared ones?"" A few minutes later, Peter and Anthony are hijacking the district attorney's car after they shoved a gun in his wife's (Jean) face. In the next scene, Jean, played by Sandra Bullock) wants the locks in her house changed again because a Latino is changing them the first time.<br/><br/>The movie was real. Racial issues were in your face. They were complex and emotional. A negative attitude can be felt all through the movie, from the white cop stopping two innocent black people in a fancy car to the woman moving closer to her husband as they are passing two black teens.<br/><br/>Gran Torino also raises questions about racism. Walt Kalwoski (Clint Eastwood) is prejudice against almost everyone he meets. But, the other characters are accepting of Walt. In Crash, each character is a victim and guilty of racism.<br/><br/>The music used throughout the film stimulates emotional responses. There is wide range of music which represents the diverse cast of characters. You hear rap, country, Latin music and music from the Middle East. It always correlates with the scene and conversation that is taking place. The film is realistic due to the variety of everyday life in Los Angeles. Because Crash is full of crimes and action scenes, silence is a powerful sound effect.<br/><br/>Crash shows that we all tend to judge others based on race. It forces us to look outside our own lives and see that we are more alike than we think. As each character crashes into another, they learn many things about themselves. In today's society is difficult to look beyond our differences. Crash is a movie that makes you think!"
"afontanilla","7","1","5","25 November 2010"," Racism is a form of oversimplification which doesn't help you understand people
","We are initially given a one-sided glimpse into two white police officers. One is a rookie cop with a good head on his shoulders, and the other is an older cop with racist ideas. Initially, we are led to be unsympathetic to the racist cop due to his words and actions towards a black couple. As the story progresses to show certain sides of other characters, we are given glimpses into other aspects of the racist cop's life, asking us to reevaluate their opinions of him. Later on in the story he saves the life of the black woman he wronged at the beginning.<br/><br/>The rookie cop leaves the older cop cop because he doesn't like racism, then becomes something of a hero when he saves the life of the black man who is the husband of the woman. However, in the end, we see that even he is not totally without racism. Fearing for his life, an intense split-section decision based on racial ideas causes him to accidentally shoot and kill his black friend.<br/><br/>The story does similar things as it follows different characters of different races whose stories interlock. We are led to think in certain ways about characters and then later on presented with something contradictory to our first impressions about them, One flaw I see in the movie is what caused the rookie cop to suddenly have racist ideas. Did he have these ideas all along? Before we see his racist side in the end, the racist cop basically tells him to just wait until he's been working as a cop for a few years, and then he'll see that racism isn't totally unjustified. This could have been the seed that was planted that caused him to shoot his friend out of racism.<br/><br/>The message I got is that when you judge people by their race, you'll sometimes be right, but you'll also sometimes be wrong. It can also be an oversimplification to say that a person is a racist or a non-racist. Not all older people with seemingly racist ideas about people are pure evil, but overall racism does more harm than good, as is the case with all oversimplifications. These sometimes save a life, but more often they cost lives. Once you've oversimplified someone you've already misunderstood them. I like how the film presents the complexities of people and their racist thoughts, giving us the inside stories that we usually don't get that are necessary for understanding. The film does a good job with this for the white, black, Mexican, and Middle Eastern characters, but falls short when it comes to the Asian immigrants."
"hfd1990","5","1","5","5 November 2010"," A very strong message!
","The movie is built on several stories that surround important messages of racism, superficialness and how people can do good and bad. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie we get into the lives of all these people and really learn about their behavior and problems. One of the strong subjects is how we judge people by their actions right away and do not at all think that some people can do any good. The story shows us that we can make up for the bad that we have done and we do not have to judge someone for their superficial actions. But we have to learn about the real person inside before we can give our review of their behavior and personality. This movie plays with emotions and fools us into judging the characters before we know the whole story about them.<br/><br/>Overall a very good movie with a strong message!"
"Red_Identity","Null","1","5","3 February 2010"," A powerful look into the world of racism
","I saw Crash around two years ago, and I liked it, but never got the hype. I rewatched it, and got this film into a deeper level. It is a film that manipulates the audience with music and over-dramatic scenes, but isn't that the way this world is? I have dealt with a lot of issues regarding racism, since I do live in Los Angeles. The mixture of all these different races does cause tension, and the way the film portrayed it was incredibly realistic. At first glance, it really seems like a melodramatic, overblown film, but it was ultimately very powerful, especially in particular scenes. The film does have flaws, but it also makes a lot of points about race stereotypes and it has some very complicated and flawed characters. The cast is great, although there are a few weak spots. The standouts had to be Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton. The two had the best scenes in the film, and both acted in such passion and force, I can see why Dillon was nominated for the Oscar, but why wasn't Newton? Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Terrence Howard, and Ryan Phillippe were all great, but Sandra Bullock also impressed me a lot. Her bad reputation is not deserved. Yes, she does pick a lot of bad roles, but when given the right material, she can really shine. Here, she proves she can really act (also notably, she is being considered a frontrunner for the 2010 Oscar for Leading Actress against Meryl Streep). If Bullock picked more challenging roles like this, she would have a better reputation. <br/><br/>Overall, Crash does have flaws, but it also has some incredibly powerful scenes that make it memorable, and a film that has a lot of ambition. While I do think Brokeback Mountain should have won that Oscar for Best Picture, Crash's bad reputation is really not deserved to the extent that it is."

","I had great expectations to see this movie, after all it was the Oscar award winner for best picture in 2005 and although it came as a surprise (even for the producers I would say) the reviews were great and it had the likings of a very good work. I don't recall the other nominees that year by heart but ""Crash"" was surely a good winner.<br/><br/>It leaves you with some bitter feelings in many scenes for the realism in which its based and for the most basic feelings of love, hate, racism and discrimination that our society brings. You get to feel anguished with some characters and also with yourself by thinking the same way.<br/><br/>The tiled Los Angeles that we see can be the reflection of many big cities around the world and the ""curse"" of the evolution of the society. That's just the way it is..."

","Crash, inspired by a true story, is a well thought out movie which portrays the way we perpetuate racism. It is thought provoking and shows the issue of racism from all sides, black, white and everything in between - as well as the way woman and men are differently and specifically effected. The movie itself is very visually appealing and features great acting moments in a very heart tugging story line which accurately shows how people work together in America's melting pot. For anyone who has experienced a tense moment regarding race, whether you were offended, purposefully or accidentally offended someone or felt your race as a burden or gift - this movie is relatable."

","""Crash"" is a movie that involves the lives of different people during a period of two days in Los Angeles: a police detective (Don Cheadle) with a mother high on drugs and a younger brother who makes a habit of stealing cars. He and his pal rob a district attorney (Brendan Fraser and and his wife (Sandra Bullock). In addition, this movie also deals with a veteran cop (Matt Dhillon), who cares for his ailing father and who disgusts his younger partner (Ryan Phillippe) by molesting a woman (Thandie Newton) during a traffic stop; and a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop which involves a Hispanic-American locksmith and his young daughter.<br/><br/>This is a powerful movie that displays how racism and stereotypes affect human lives. What we see in this movie is misinterpretation, prejudgment, heroic acts, retribution, hatred and forgiveness. We also see both good and bad acts in this movie, like when the cop John Ryan (Dhillon) molested Christine Thayer (Thandie Newton) during a traffic stop, but ends up being the one who saves her from a car accident. This is my favorite scene in the movie, which combines the acts of forgiveness, irony and heroism. Another notable scene is when Jean Calbot (Bullock), after being robbed, vents that if she complains to society about her being robbed by two Black men, she would be considered racist because she is White. This is true in parts of society today, as the subject of race is misinterpreted in many ways.<br/><br/>Another touching scene is when the locksmith was being shielded by his young daughter from a bullet. Turns out, she survives the incident, even though it appears she has been shot. It depicts that even in the hardest and grimmest times in society, miracles exist. <br/><br/>Overall, a very powerful and dramatic movie full of character development and depth. The only downside is that the movie lacks some comic relief. But, it is certainly worthy of its Oscar win.<br/><br/>Grade B"

","""Crash"" was a big, satisfying surprise for me. I was kind of skeptical because there was a lot of hype surrounding it. I'm glad to say that I enjoyed this movie for it's whole running time. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard, and Michael Peña carry the movie on their back with their performances. Excellent job by mature actors. All of them gave the best of them and support their recent Oscar nominations. Sandra Bullock, Ludicrous, Ryan Phillipe, Jennifer Esposito and the rest of the supporting cast also deliver a great performance. Overall, the cast is perfect and makes the movie worth watchable because of it. Special mentions for Bahar Soomekh for a solid, believable performance. I must also say that she's extremely beautiful and sexy.<br/><br/>The situations are not all about racism. It's also about the way that people can demonstrate feelings towards other people not caring about their race, religion, or origins. The movie shows that everyone can discriminate and also, that everyone can change for good. For example; Maria (Sandra Bullock's domestic employee) showed that she was a better friend for Mrs. Cabot than her so believed best friend. Matt Dillon's character really cared and risked his life for Cameron's wife when she had an accident even that he molested her the day before. That message shows that all human beings can get along and live in the same place.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a light dramatic movie with a message, a positive message that will stay in your mind forever. This is the kind of movie to watch in order to feel good after the credits. The movie offers excellent acting, a great plot, perfect atmosphere, soundtrack, and excellent direction. What else can you ask for? Haggis is a film maker with a huge future. Please watch this movie. It's not overrated as many others say.

","Before you all knowing pillow biters jump on the ""Brokeback should have won"" bandwagon, let me spell a few things out...<br/><br/>1. Crash is a metaphor. NO THERE WAS NOT A PHYSICAL CRASH IN THIS MOVIE. Sure there were collisions, conflicts of interests if you will. Take for instance Matt Dillon's character vying for the affection of Mary Jane Watson with his best friend. It didn't work out-WHATEVER.<br/><br/>2. Yes, there was drug use. LOTS OF DRUG USE. But you know what...grow up. There was a message here. THESE PEOPLE'S LIVES CRASHED TOGETHER BECAUSE OF HOW F*CKED THEY GOT.<br/><br/>3. Racism is real, folks whether you like it or not. And obviously Matt Dillon likes it a lot. Whether or not this is a reflection of his quality of character in real life can't be determined with the evidence provided. If I had to guess I would say maybe.<br/><br/>4. There is a second meaning to Crash. Dillon's character CRASHED out of rhythm when he realized the affect his behavior had on others. GET OVER IT FOLKS, THIS KIND OF STUFF HAPPENS...PEOPLE CHANGE.<br/><br/>If that summary isn't sufficient, I don't know what is. Tasteful, provocative, gritty...Crash came at the audience in more ways than it could handle and certainly changed my perspective."

","I think it was a very good movie, whether or not people agree with the way it was made or the issue it focused on is another thing. The movie whether it is predictable or boring still evokes out of people emotions that many may not be willing to accept. It showed that stereotypes are not only believed by whites but by every culture about another culture. While many may think that just because they do not see racism first hand or right in their face, it is there on a subconscious level and some face it everyday and some may face it periodically. The movie showed it just exactly how some people today feel. It is not as though Hollywood executives were just coming up with this stuff. It is what regular people think. It was good that this movie brought it to attention because it is still a problem."

Simplicity (my English teacher told me) is rarely simple. I'm a movie fan and have seen plenty, so can sense predictability within seconds of a movie. I don't think this film is remotely predictable. It has some violence but not much. What it's highly effective at achieving is exposing human beings prejudices, and our human reactions. It shows not characters but people, and how are reactions can impact on others be they good or bad people. This is not preachy. It's just human. I'm not going to give more away because I do think if you can see this movie, it's definitely worth a look in.<br/><br/>(I had a racist incident when I was 6, best friend dumped me when her parents found out how close we were.

"william-jones40","8","1","5","14 April 2006"," fabulous essay on race in America
","Crash (Paul Haggis, 2004) Having missed it when it came out, I saw this film recently on DVD and rated it highly. It's been deservedly nominated for an Oscar but in a year featuring gay cowpokes and authors, I doubt it has too much of a chance. It covers a two day period, unravelling the intertwined back stories of a number of people involved in an L.A. traffic accident. These comprise: a black police detective with druggy mother; two black car thieves constantly discussing racism; a District Attorney and his wife; a white cop with a sick father; a successful Hollywood black director and his wife; and a Persian shop-owner desperately concerned with the safety of his business and his family.<br/><br/>The theme is racism and a bleak vision of the US it provides. In the UK we are well aware of racism but our experience never begins to compare with that of our American cousins. We see in the film how race permeates every aspect of society, contaminating like a disease, spreading fear and paranoia; framing the lives of the poor and freighting the nightmares of the rich. The racist white cop, trying to help his father, becomes infuriated by the unresponsive health service bureaucracy, staffed by poor blacks. He takes it out on the director's beautiful wife whom he more or less molests after stopping their car and shamefully intimidating them. But there are no crude stereotypes; later on, at the scene of the accident, the cop acts heroically to save the life of the same woman.<br/><br/>Paranoia is freely on display; one of the car thieves suggests buses have big windows so that the poor blacks who use them can be clearly seen and humiliated. The shop-owner encounters extreme hostility on account of his Middle Eastern provenance; he changes the locks on his shop but does not trust the locksmith who says he needs a new door. Consequently his shop is burgled and trashed with racist comments scrawled on the wall. He takes a gun to seek reparation from the locksmith whom he holds responsible. Each story is dependent on the others in some complex fashion but the messages are subtle, oblique, not broadcast via the customary Hollywood megaphone. The acting is top notch throughout, but with only a few major stars- Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock and Don Cheadle who also produces the film. It's a bleak but intelligent and riveting vision of how, despite its success at being a multicultural melting pot, racism has entered into the very DNA of the USA and will continue to play havoc for as long as the country exists.

","I am bored with the ppl that think they know who they are, and therefore would not like this movie. I had one friend that always knew himself, but always discovered something about himself that he didn't know, as life took him through experiences. To admit you don't know who you are, will prevent you to think you are the best, one of the motives for a lot of crap in life, will prevent you to enter some situations without thinking them before, another reason for a lot of crap in life. A lot of situations that are generating crap in life are created by ppl that think they know themselves. This movie is not great for the one that knows he doesn't know himself, that realizes life is a sum of experiences you need to learn from and that you don't know what is good or wrong on the long term. Therefore, it is not a good movie based on the assumption all the ppl know themselves an we live in a very nice environment, ppl around us are very nice and are not creating crap for us as we don't create crap for them. But, as I don't really know a person I can respect, and sometimes I cannot respect myself, this is a GREAT movie, as it has the chance to give some ppl something to think about.

The first is that the music is loud and detracts from the movie. The other thing is that, even though we are left with a feeling of hope for ourselves at the end, there is no comic relief within the movie at all. There is never the chance to just relax during for a moment. At the end of the movie I was tired.<br/><br/>It is definitely a movie to see."

"zzhang1000","9","1","5","27 March 2006"," A work of cinematic genius.
","According to Newton's Third Law of Motion, ""For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" In ""Crash,"" the energy is conserved while we see lives of the characters either created or destroyed by events. Through exploration of tense racial and political subjects, ""Crash"" grips onto audiences with vignettes of superior drama.<br/><br/>During this year's Academy Awards, ""Crash"" took an unexpected victory for the ""Best Picture"" award over the expected winner ""Brokeback Mountain."" After watching ""Crash,"" however, it became clear why this film is highly acclaimed.<br/><br/>We are introduced to several characters all in some ways are connected to each other over a 36-hour time frame occurring in Los Angeles. The movie portrays the variety of struggles between African-Americans and the LAPD, the paranoia and prejudice of Hispanics and Muslims, and the dark and bright sides of crime. In the end, all characters collide, and they are changed forever.<br/><br/>The genius in ""Crash"" not only lies in the plot, but also in the themes and messages lodged inside. The obvious issue is racism: minorities are targets of white men and sometimes of one another. The movie explores the tensions rooted in hardships and misunderstandings. For example, Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) reveals his troubles are due to his ill father and their struggle to support themselves. Although not a ""liberal"" message, the movie downplays affirmative action and states that policy will harm minorities and only human intuition can help save discrimination. Several other ""liberal"" criticisms prevail such as Medicare reform, feminism, and immigration.<br/><br/>The characters in Crash are astounding. Especially fascinating is the rapper Ludicrous, who recently gained limelight acting in major films (""Hustle & Flow""The characters Terrence Howard have played beat up Ludicrous in both movies). His character, Anthony, is morally questionable yet he devises astute philosophies of life. In addition, the movie revives several diminishing actors such as Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock. Even the minor characters such as the fussy Asian woman were well-articulated, bringing ""Crash"" a high level of credibility.<br/><br/>But I gave the film a 9/10 rating because some of the content didn't connect well while some characters disappear after their climax and rarely resurface until a shot of him/her in the end. However, ""Crash"" is a well-merited film that is definitely worth watching or keeping. Since most of the political messages are strong, conservatives might be repulsed by these sensitive subjects. GREAT FILM!"

Funny thing is, i'm black. Really makes you think about yourself. Who you are, what you are, how you are.<br/><br/>So open your mind for this movie and watch it, confront yourself, and just maybe you'll change in a good or even a bad way.

","!!!!! (Possible Spoilers Ahead) !!!!!<br/><br/>The movie Crash, which is directed by Paul Haggis, has violence depicted throughout the entire film. In Hollywood movies where violence is the focal point, films typically consists of physical brutality in which weapons, explosions, and killings are used. In the extremely violent movie, Crash, emotional violence, however, takes precedence over the physical violence. There are very few scenes in this film in which the characters are exempt from receiving or performing physical and/or emotional cruelty. Through this observation, my initial response to the film was that the director had gone too far in his depiction of our society and the appalling way we treat and view others. After further consideration of the film, however, I realized the scenes needed to be intense in order to really show us how racism, stereotyping, and discrimination thrive in our society and the damaging effects that these actions have on everyone. When thinking about my initial opinion of this film, Roger Ebert sums it up effectively in his article "" Passion of Christ,"" he states, ''evaluate a film on the basis of what it intends to do, not what I think it should have done."" Haggis's offensive and graphic scenes are needed to show us that, unfortunately, racism, stereotyping, and discrimination are alive and flourishing in our society.<br/><br/>Racism runs abundant in this movie. When the issue of racism comes up, one tends to think of a particular skin color or class that is affected, but in this movie we see that racism affects all of us. It showed us that no matter what a person's nationality, skin color or financial status may be, no one is excluded from this form of violence. In Crash, we see the discrimination of Asians against other Asians, cops against other cops, peers against fellow peers, and of course the more frequently seen, one race against another race. In our society today, as in the movie, this should not be the norm. Our lives are all intertwined on a daily basis and based on this fact alone, we should all live as one group of people, one group of Americans, not as individual groups that tend to be based on racial, ethnic or social status. This message was conveyed well by Haggis. Throughout the movie characters from different backgrounds and groups are introduced and one by one these characters become involved in each others lives through mere chance. Unfortunately, because of the common acts of discrimination and racism, the way in which these characters become involved with one another is not in a positive manner. The inappropriate words or actions of one person typically affect many people, not just the intended victim as seen in this film. Racism, discrimination, and violence seem to have a snowball effect.<br/><br/>The snowball effect of violence is seen in the movie when two young African American men carjack a prominent, married, white couple. The anger the young African American men feel about their position in life makes them see their deviant actions as being valid. They feel because they are not taking from ""their own kind"" that their violent actions, such as the carjacking, are justifiable. At this point, the prominent white couple is the victim. The wife then turns her anger towards another person, the locksmith that comes to her home to change the locks due to the carjacking. Her anger from being the victim is now directed at the locksmith. The locksmith happens to be Hispanic with a tattoo. To the wife, he is nothing but a ""gang banger"" who is going to sell a copy of her house key to some other deviant person. He is now the wife's victim through the act of stereotyping. She is stereotyping this man because of what he looks like, not who he is. The African American men feel initially they are the victims of society, the wife then became the victim, to be followed by the locksmith. This cycle of discrimination will undoubtedly continue, unless society decides to stop this type of behavior.<br/><br/>Although the focus in the movie is on the negative side of society, the end of the movie does show that there is compassion in this world. One of the men who participated in the carjacking ends up saving the lives of about 10 people who were brought over from Asia to be illegally sold. The carjacker could have made five hundred dollars per Asian, but instead he decided not to take the money and let the Asian people go free. This part of the movie shows that society does have compassion for others, but it is up to each individual whether to express this generous trait or not. The way in which society responds to daily life situations will ultimately affect many others. Haggis does a great job conveying this message. The characters in this film were too harsh, too cruel, and too violent but the scenes, I feel, needed to be viewed in the manner to really open our eyes to the emotional violence that still exists in our society today."

","Outstanding allegory on our society and the views (both subtle and apparent) that we may have on others of varying racial and ethnic backgrounds. Over a two-day period in present-day Los Angeles, a whole cast of vivid characters clash and crash into one another in an emotionally draining sparring match of wits, words and explosive outcomes. Police officer Matt Dillon and new partner Ryan Phillippe do not see eye-to-eye when it comes to law enforcement practices. Dillon's blatant racism toward African Americans immediately makes him an unsympathetic character who seems to be reeling due to the fact that he is unable to find suitable health care for his ailing father. A high class African-American television director (the always outstanding Terrence Howard) and his socialite wife (Thandie Newton) find constant struggles due to the fact that they do have the finer things in life and are part of a societal racial minority---something that many others just cannot comprehend or understand. A district attorney (Brendan Fraser) has political problems on top of political problems as his blatantly terrified wife (Sandra Bullock's finest turn) becomes a jumbled bundle of nerves after they are carjacked by two hilariously informed African-American thieves (Larenz Tate and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) who obviously have their fair share of philosophical meanderings. A Mexican-American locksmith (Michael Pena) tries to provide comfort and solace to his young wife and daughter as he attempts to give them better lives than what he has had. A Persian immigrant (Shaun Toub) who is near a breaking point after the latest robbery of his convenient store also gets thrown into the dizzying mix. His adult daughter (Bahar Soomekh) tries to be the calming influence in his turbulent life. And of course we have two police detectives/lovers (Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito) who try to make sense of senseless happenings, while having trouble themselves in their personal relationship. Paul Haggis' demoralizingly real and complex screenplay is revolutionary and his direction is subtly strong as he takes a backseat behind the camera and lets his actors run to the bank with the multi-layered script. Highly intelligent and thought-provoking in its ""this is happening right now"" approach, ""Crash"" literally runs over its audience with strong cinematic executions and conclusions. 5 stars out of 5."
"songofdavid","9","1","5","7 February 2006"," Film's plot and cast rise above the difficulty of believably conveying a parabolic message about racism
","People are bad; people are good. Most of us are somewhere in the middle, quite capable of taking a step away from the gray, toward light or darkness, depending on the internal and external factors which gradually shape our lives. Want to see several examples? Take a look at this engrossing film, which from the get-go latches onto your senses and even pulls your conscience along with it so that you--well, I did, anyway--are continually having to relate to situations which shed a sobering light and a hideous shadow upon that place in your soul which attempts to separate right from wrong, that corner of your psyche which can't always distinguish good intentions from calloused self-righteousness, can't always make sense of why things happen the way they do to seemingly average everyday people.<br/><br/>Similar to Magnolia, in the sense that several unrelated characters are thrust upon one another's paths, this film's plot highlights the oftentimes easily overlooked notion that we are all connected, that we are all significant parts of a great whole; and it manages to convey this lesson without triteness or blatant, conventional, highbrow lessons on morality--for the most part. Rarely do dramas such as this inject humorous Decalogue into hardship, criminal behavior and downright cynical despondency and alienation. And rarely does a serious film engage its audience by casting several flippant floodlights upon racism and its many disguises: e.g., its pretentious self-righteousness and its need to justify itself in the face of objectivity and honest intentions.<br/><br/>Most of the time the cast steers clear of melodrama and superficiality, sensibly and sensitively providing pathos and relatability to their gradually intersecting roles. Particularly noteworthy are Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard, Thandie Newton, and heck, even Sandra Bullock (who doesn't usually exhibit a whole lot of range).<br/><br/>At times, some of the coincidences do seem a bit too contrived, a bit too determined to tell a story about the cold and calloused side of humanity and the chance for redemption which waits for us just around the corner; it is easily forgivable, however, simply because this is a parable come to life, a study on the trappings we have set up for ourselves by refusing to understand and genuinely accept (and embrace) our cultural differences. If you have ever doubted it, you might walk away from this film thinking that we are all racists to some degree. And yet we are equally equipped with reliable consciences; we are somehow quite capable of drawing kindness and tenderness from the very same hearts which harbor those self-serving, destructive impulses. What we choose to do based upon those impulses will change us--for better or worse--whether we acknowledge it or not."

By the end I just felt that I had been manipulated into feeling bad and sorry for these people, by the flashes of heart-wrenching situations. Very surprised that this is a real contender for an Academy Award - there are more deserving films out there..I think that if it does win anything it's purely because of the hype and advertising it is getting and not because it is a truly deserving film.

","Crash is basically a film that pretends to be more important than it really is, and that's the one big flaw that hindered my enjoyment of it. It really is a very well made drama, and an impressive directorial debut from Haggis, who obviously learned a lot from his collaborative work with Clint Eastwood  Crash is nearly as dark and gritty as anything the master had done. A cast of second rate Hollywood stars and B-list character actors  which includes Matt Dillon (who hadn't had a truly impressive dramatic role in more than a decade), Don Cheadle (who made his breakthrough the very same year with Hotel Rwanda), Brandon Frasier and Sandra Bullock among many others works surprisingly well together, and the film is a strong and professionally made drama with some very good dialog and excellent atmospheric cinematography.<br/><br/>Crash is good, but it doesn't have what it takes to be truly great, and I wouldn't take anyone calling it one of the most important films of the year very seriously. The Altman-ish mish-mash of characters whose separate stories interact in surprising ways has become overtly fashionable in Hollywood in recent years, and sometimes it seems to me like the main objective is to avoid the nuisance of developing interesting individual characters; in fact, not one character in Crash  including Cheadle's and Dillon's, both of whom give undeniably remarkable performances  is interesting enough to be considered a main character, and I found myself completely detached from all of them. The film tries to get across a message about the racial tension in America  and some of the images and stories are definitely shocking, moving and effective, but the message is ultimately vague, and it often seems like a pale and weak imitation of Spike Lee. At any rate it never at any moment manages to be half as powerful and potent as anything Spike had made.<br/><br/>Crash is definitely a good drama that's worth your time, but it's not one of the best or most interesting films of the year. At its best it's as good as the weakest of Clint Eastwood's films  and if you've watched his films then you know that's high praise. Don't believe the hype; Crash is a very good film but it's no news. If you hated Magnolia, 21 Grams or anything of that genre then you're not likely to get that much out of Crash either."

","Several stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles involving a collection of inter-related characters. A black police detective with a drugged out mother and a thieving younger brother, two car thieves who are constantly theorizing on society and race, the distracted district attorney and his irritated and pampered wife, a racist veteran cop (caring for a sick father at home) who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner, a successful black Hollywood director and his wife who must deal with racist cop, a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop, a Hispanic locksmith and his young daughter who is afraid of bullets, and more.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis won an Oscar for his work on the Best Picture winner ""Million Dollar Baby"". While ""Baby"" itself doesn't deserve the praise that it is given, the writing did. Here Haggis gives us another piece of work that will have some in tears and others filled with rage at the morals of society.<br/><br/>Crash's core theme is that of racism and how it is destroying today's society. Crash tries to get the point across that this prejudice is destroying our ways of communication with each other. The film uses L.A. as it's setting to show us that virtually anyone and everyone can be racist. Which is where Crash faults. Although the film does deal with this theme, about 95% of the characters are racist and uses almost every stereotype to showcase the problems in society.<br/><br/>With those two missteps aside, Crash is a film that delivers everything that is promises to. Brilliant writing, good directing and a cast ensemble that gives us great performances. Paul Haggis wrote characters that had problems and he knew exactly how to present them to us and how to deal with them. Many directors who write the material have a hard time trying to abstract the material to screen. David S. Goyer failed at this with Blade Trinity, but here Haggis has enough experience to know what he wants from his actors and in what direction he wants to take them.<br/><br/>Out of all the performances in this picture the select few that would stand out would be the racist cop, played by Matt Dillion. The successful black director, played by Terrance Howard and the racist wife of the district attorney played by Sandra Bullock. Dillion shows that his character is an egotistical selfish prick, but in the end, we end of not hating him, but feeling sorrow for him. He has the trouble of taking care of a sick father and finally puts the life of an individual before the colour of their skin. Terrance Howard gives a performance that is just as good as his portrayal of a pimp in Hustle and Flow. Howard is able to convey so much emotion through his eyes. Finally Bullock plays a character that is radically different from anything that she has done before and is able to convince us of her fear and hate towards those that are of a different race.<br/><br/>Crash delivers lots of moments of tension and fear for the lives of the characters. I was glued to the screen when the little girl put her ""invisbile cape"" to the test. All the characters effect the lives of each other whether they know it or not and it all fits together perfectly well. Crash is one of the few movies this year to give us a powerful message.<br/><br/>With a talent writer behind the pen and knowing what he wants in this film, he is able to give us a great film. Along with one of the best cast ensembles to grace the screen since the likes of True Romance. Crash gives us a movie that will make us cry, laugh and feel anger towards. Not many movies these days are able to do this, but Crash makes it work beautifully."

The acting was top notch and I have to say that Paul Haggis is a very underrated director.<br/><br/>I didn't think of it as a work of fiction. I think the theme of this movie happens every day. I like how it shows that the things that should make you happy, often don't and also that you can find redemption in the strangest of circumstances.

","This is a story (term used loosely) about people having a bad day (or life) and all of them have someone to blame it on (except themselves). Don Cheadle's character, Detective Graham, says in the beginning of the movie, that we have all lost touch with one another and find a way to ""crash"" into each other to reconnect. When we are not ""crashing"" we are hiding from others and from ourselves.<br/><br/>It's how we ""reconnect"" that is disturbing. We use the negatives: hate, prejudice, anger, fear, violence.......well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>The cinematography, dialogue, and acting are all good, but nothing outstanding. OK, I would say Cheadle is really coming on as a major actor, but it's the content that is the focus here. One can see these dark-sided things almost everyday in the police and lawyer shows on TV and besides the newspapers are full of this stuff as well.<br/><br/>We get to see dark slices of life of various characters. Yes, the characters do save themselves, but this is not to say this will always happen in real life. However I am not sure the Rookie cop saves himself.<br/><br/>So even though the production is good I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It is not a ""must see."""

I enjoyed the movie but did we really need another Magnolia? Instead of the cast singing along to the soundtrack we get the camera panning through the cast one by one as a song played. I wonder what Paul Thomas Anderson would think watching the remake of his movie. I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.

","Y'know how everyone in L.A. is a bit overly-racist and everything in life happens because of something spawning from race-relations to one another? No? Well, I never really thought so either, but this movie isn't trying to push that issue down your throat as much as it's trying to make people think about their actions upon one another no matter the race card.<br/><br/>Basically the movie takes place in modern times, Los Angeles, and it is edited to show how many people we deal with in everyday life that we might have a problem with because of their reputation as any given race. The characters end up tying to each others' lives whether they wish they did or not. And hindsight is always 20/20 so the characters end up understanding that we all co-exist and have to get along and do what is right to live freely in this society.<br/><br/>I love how this movie, even though it was directed by a Canadian, Paul Haggis...just kidding. I really enjoyed this film all the way through. It had a little bit of everything, from stylish shots to near-perfect acting from the widely acclaimed cast. It featured beautiful, ""chill"" tracks which played over very provocative scenes of violence of all types (sexual, homicidal, verbal), which brought the movie closer to home and more universal. The film is so universal and generic as a topic of discussion that you would think that the director would be on thin ice by presenting race relations as something that we have yet to get a grasp on, but the truth is that there are plenty of reasons why we choose to hold on to these stereotypes and this movie shows some of those reasons and some resolution to these problems.<br/><br/>I gave it a definite 9/10. There's no question that this movie is going to be around for a good long while with the message, the actors involved, the mature nature with which this movie deals with some of society's problems on race relations, and the outstanding directing and cinematography displayed in this film. Excellent piece of work.<br/><br/>It's also nice to see that there are directors who can still provide a couple of hours of entertainment while teaching the audience through the finished work."

"ExpendableMan","9","1","5","31 August 2005"," Convoluted but compelling
","One of the most impressive films to come out of America so far this year, Paul Haggis's 'Crash' is a great drama, presenting a series of interconnecting stories in Los Angeles that explore the social repercussions of racial bigotry and stereotyping. Heading the impressive cast is Matt Dillon playing a racist cop with a nigh on terrifying authenticity. Watching him molest a black woman while her husband looks on helplessly in one of the early scenes leaves no questions in your mind that this man is an unimaginable bastard. Yet Dillon never plays it up, never pandering to the camera and instead breathing life into his character in a very natural, ordinary way. In a highly distinguished cast, his is the standout role.<br/><br/>It is not the only one to recommend the movie however as the rest of the actors put in terrific performances. Sandra Bullock for instance takes a step away from her 'Miss Congeniality' image as a deeply angry woman making venomous racist attacks to mask her own depression. Watching her tear into Spanish family man Michael Pena while he is fixing her lock, it is difficult to imagine her as the sweet, girl-next-door type she built her early career on. Then there is Don Cheadle, a man who brings great dignity to his role as an Internal affairs detective investigating a shooting between two police officers that may have been racially motivated who comes to realise that his own ethnic background will have political repercussions on the case.<br/><br/>What may put some off this movie though is it's subject matter. Racism has forever been a serious issue in today's melting pot culture and one of the main points put across is that for all our protests, we are each of us, racist in some form or another. Like it or not, racial stereotyping still exists among all of us and the director pulls no punches in driving this point home.<br/><br/>Even so, for all those put off by the above statement, bear in mind that this is still an utterly terrific film. There may be many story lines crossing over with one another, but it is not difficult to follow and each of them remains compelling viewing. In fact, given the breadth of stories covered, it's surprising it isn't longer than it is, Dillon's hatred and racism and eventual redemption for example could have been a movie in its own right. Highly recommended."

This is something you don't see everyday. I felt angry, but not at the film. At myself. For some reason, it struck me in the moment, the right moment.

"rogerdarlington","Null","1","5","14 August 2005"," A triumph for Haggis
","This is a movie which has nothing in common with the controversial 1996 Cronenberg work of the same title. Instead it can be compared with ""Grand Canyon"" and ""Magnolia"" in that all three films feature a series of interlocking stories in a California setting. Here Paul Haggis - who wrote the rightly acclaimed ""Million Dollar Baby"" - makes his directorial debut with a film which he also conceived and co-wrote by presenting a set of linked lives in Los Angeles over a two-day period. The is a city in which estranged and fearful people crash into one another both physically and metaphorically.<br/><br/>So far, so relatively familiar. What really distinguishes this work, however, is the complex and controversial theme of race. The so-called American melting pot is shown to be a boiling cauldron of multiple tensions and prejudices, whether it is the Iranian shopkeeper who despises the Mexican locksmith or it is the girlfriend of the black policeman who objects to him calling her Mexican, when her parents are from Puerto Rica and El Salvador, to the same woman who mocks an aggressive Chinese woman for her poor pronunciation of English. This is a complicated world in which a good cop can find himself committing a terrible act, while his racist colleague can discover himself behaving heroically with the last person who would expect or want that.<br/><br/>Of course, the plotting is contrived, but the whole of cinema is contrived which is what distinguishes storytelling from straight documentary. This is an intelligent and compelling narrative which constantly demands attention and, once it is all over, provokes much thought. We are shown that the world is not colour-coded and we need to take the time and trouble to understand who people really are. The ensemble acting by a host of capable performers is a delight, whether it is Sandra Bullock appearing against type as an angry and prejudiced housewife, Matt Dillon as a racist but brave policeman, Don Cheadle as a detective trying to balance the conflicting pressures of career and family, or Thandie Newton who wants her husband to be braver in standing against racial injustice, or the many other strong supporting roles."

It was nothing like what I thought it would be like, either. I don't remember hearing about or seeing any advertising for when it came out. I heard Oprah mention once on TV in passing.

We all harbor stereotypes, fears, judgments and yet a fascination with ""the other"" and we often do not realize just how this effects us and society as a whole. The movie digs deep into these emotions and draws them out brilliantly in a montage of triggers that are all woven together in a period of 24 hours in L.A.<br/><br/>Black, white, Puerto Rican/Mexican, Arab/Persian, mixed ethnicity, you name it, it's all in here and it's refreshingly in your face. It is for that very reason that the film is about hatred and hope, violence and redemption. Perhaps most poignantly, it is filled with all the complexity of modern life and provides no easy answers.<br/><br/>You will be left speechless. All of the actors, most well known, play roles that are against their ""types"" of roles and it is for this reason that it is perhaps so impacting and believable.

The white lady unable to trust black people yet discovering it's a black person who'll help her in an emergency whilst everyone else including her husband can't be bothered or can't be reached, her husband probably carrying on with his black PA, the cop who thinks he's decent but racism can even get him, the cop who's definitely racist and yet will save anyone's life. The coloured man who's insulted by the cop sexually abusing his wife, and daren't answer back, and her fury at his cowardice - or was it just common sense? The cop who's forced to tell lies and make himself seem a fool because the police department don't want a race scandal. The DA embarrassed people will find out he was carjacked by ""black guys"" and trying to find a publicity fiddle to keep this secret. The shopkeeper insulted by being labelled with the ""wrong"" ethnic origin and the usual insurance small print that denies him compensation and then driven to desperate measures. The people trafficking. Guns here there and everywhere, easy to get, easy to use, shoot first, think later. I mean, it's got almost everything neatly fitted into this movie, hasn't it!

This movie can stun, surprise, and more than anything bring reality to what we as human beings think and share with the rest of our world; whether we like it or not.<br/><br/>This movie makes people think, and that in itself makes it a great movie. Without going into too much detail, this movie puts relation to all the stereotypes widely professed by our nations as a whole, such as: Asians being terrible drivers, African Americans being the majority involved with stealing and gang related activity, and in my opinion how Caucasians are the most racist individuals on the planet. Each different scenario sheds light on those perspectives, but more so how the movie was put together needs to be expressed to show how good this movie actually is.<br/><br/>All of the scenarios in ways tie together, and give good examples of how much the stereotypes that have been created and concreted are: wrong, immoral, sad, and even more than anything how any of those take what we do and say out of context to create hate and animosity towards each other. The feuds created amongst our mixed array of citizens come from these awful stereotypes and this movie does an amazing job of exploiting the wrong in them all, with brilliant acting and brilliant storyline.<br/><br/>An absolute must see."
"alienworlds","Null","1","6","1 September 2009"," Interesting to see scenes of life through the eyes of LA
","I thought it was a film intended to move towards a big climax which it did, so in that way it was a good allegory for the human experience in the modern world-people are always racing towards something or away from something-but nobody is stationary for very long, and things are always peaking and then falling back again. I liked the characters even though I didn't always agree with them. There is a contradiction in the celebration of the human experience in todays cinema in that we embrace the complexities and new experiences of the modern world but at the same time the happenstance of the modern melange can create very real and sometimes stomach turning problems. I think LA is probably unique in that is is such a car culture contrasted against other cities in North America. Car culture is much like 'cargo culture' where life imitates the life before it, not always representing the meanings of what was, so clearly. In the film people search for meaning in a world that threatens to crush them out of existence in the blink of an eye. Is it the pursuit of order in chaos that drives us on?, is a question asked by the film. Mostly we are just swept from place to situation by events we can no longer control, is what I think the answer is.It's nice to think we are in control of things, but things mostly just control us. Good work, maybe tries to deal with too many situations at once."
"a-kay-47","9","1","6","5 August 2009"," Powerful and emotionally-gripping Film-making
","People keep bagging Crash on how unrealistic the characters are and how unprobable the plot is, with 'unprobable' coincidences. I don't disagree on that this movie is very unrealistic and very unprobable, but what I do disagree on is bagging on this movie. This is a very fine film because it absorbs and captures the viewer from the very start. The first moments of Crash shows a middle-aged Asian woman and a Mexican woman ripping each others heads off with REALLY racist comments, which makes us go insane and hate these characters, but the point to be considered is that THIS FILM DOES MAKE US GO INSANE AND HATE THESE CHARACTERS. Any film to make us feel attached and absorbed into itself is a very well done one, even if it were to use outlandish and ridiculously fake dialogue; kudos to Paul Haggis for writing such an amazing screenplay.<br/><br/>In the most intense moments of the film, which there are a plenty, swelling music DROWNS the viewer and even as corny as it sounds, it absolutely works. You become so involved in what's happening on screen, but the gift of this film is the entire time the viewer is aware that he is not in the film. The viewer is so aware he is not in the film because he wishes he WAS in the film, screaming and ecstatic at these very flawed yet human characters. Crash takes a hold of your emotions, and tosses it around on-screen, making you fear the worst for the radically unstable and unpredictable film.<br/><br/>Why do people hate this film so much? Not many movies do what Crash does, not many movies make you feel what Crash makes you feel. It's a movie that makes us examine ourselves and others around us; there should be not a single person that walks out of this movie with no emotions, whether it be hating this film or loving it; either way, Crash succeeds."
"Gunn","9","1","6","26 June 2009"," A Great Film about our prejudices!
","This Oscar winner was deserving of its Oscar. It has a terrific cast including: Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillipe, Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser as well as some lesser known, but equally gifted character actors. Writer/Director Paul Haggis does an excellent job of keeping the proceedings moving along swiftly and smoothly. The story involves the way we, most people, tend to categorize ethnicity, behavior and actions stereotypically, which results in bigotry of varying degrees. The film asks will we ever be able to ""get along"" together? Personally, I feel we ALL have to change our behavior towards one another before this can ever happen. We need to stop blaming each other and behave as human beings should. This film illustrates how we ""read"" the behavior of others wrongly most of the time. We need to RESPECT: each other, the law, sexual behavior, all religions and creeds, our various ethnicities, the planet earth, our spaces, our countries and more. The world today lacks RESPECT! People toss their garbage and litter in the streets, they rarely say PLEASE and THANK YOU, they are less polite than 20 years ago, they live in their own little worlds, the education system has failed the last four or five generations. Kids are less creative because of computers, cell phones, violent video games, violent films, the internet. They don't respect their teachers, parents and authority figures as people did 20 years ago. Profanity is commonplace. The world is changing because of this and much of this is illustrated in ""Crash"". I hope it's not too late to change things around. Sorry, if this comes off as a downer, but I really am concerned about our (humanity's) future."

","Hated by many on the principle that it somehow stole the Academy Award for Best Picture from Brokeback Mountain, I consider it the best of the nominees that year.<br/><br/>Further dismissed by some as an ""after school special"" as if a film with a social conscience that presents itself in a mainstream, mass-market fashion is a bad thing, Crash certainly doesn't win any points for originality but it's solidly entertaining throughout, it rarely sinks into melodrama, and is a frequently very powerful portrait of a society rotting from the disease of racism.<br/><br/>It does tend to overplay the ""Everyone's at least a little bit racist"" card and could have benefited from a lot more subtlety - it's occasionally very heavy-handed and obvious in making its sometimes dubious points - but I don't see anything in the film resembling a stereotype and that's a rare thing for a film of this kind. The ill-judged early comic relief scenes with the two carjackers are unfortunate and don't sit well with the generally sombre tone, but at least they're entertaining in their own right."

","The movie Crash is s a fresh and original look at different people of different races in different situations.  One can compare this episode like movie to films like Magnolia or Babel. The movie is labeled as a race drama  but there are no stereotypes to be found. It's  surprising how the development  of the plot and the interaction of the characters is absolutely unpredictable. I dare say that in this movie the racial barrier is being lifted: we are all good and bad at the same time, we are all racists when we're down and generous when we feel strong. This movie depicts a world view that is similar to my own philosophy: Life is not predictable, there are no stereotypes in it. We aren't being punished or given credit for our actions by God (fate) when we think  we should. There is no justice and no sense or pattern in life that we are able to define or to foresee. But there is one thing in life: The capacity to hope, to believe in the good in everyone and in miracles ­ now and then. And sometimes a miracle will happen.<br/><br/>I thought that nowadays there are no more movies like Frank Capra's any more. But this movie made me feel pretty close to it."

","This will Oscar winning Indi film is set to become a classic with great performances from all of the main actors. The film deals with the differing and evolving values of African Americans in a way never seen before in Film. It also deals with racism and corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department. The film exhibits an interweaving plot structure that is masterfully shot and edited on a small budget. Film making at its finest. The story amongst its many intricacies and character transformational arcs in particular Matt Dillons character there is also a strange twist with an African Black Criminal who gets saved by one of his ""Brother"" then strangely ends up liberating a group of illegal immigrant ""slaves"". Also the almost tragic confrontation between the Mayors wife and a hardworking family Latino man and also another run in with newly arrived middle eastern family. The clash of cultures is the real true life paradigm of American culture ""....giving me you poor and unwashed..."" or to that effect. This film clearly demonstrates why the Americans lead the world in groundbreaking film techniques as well as those that tastefully reveal the human condition. The blocking of scenes and the emotive delivery of each scene keeps you spellbound throughout the film. This film would easily be amongst the best I have seen in the few years and all its actors deserved Oscars infinitely more than any actors in the last decade. This film is actually worth buying on DVD and I hope this style of film inspires more great auteurs to surface as the current spate of trashy films is slowly killing the industry. I strongly recommend all to see this film and it should be shown in schools and be studied."

","From almost newcomer Paul Haggis (writer of Million Dollar Baby) this is a really inventive ensemble drama story. Yes are one or two crashes in the film, but this story is more involved with characters interconnected by collisions and close encounters. The connection with all characters in this film that I find really intriguing, and that almost got the film into trouble, is they all deal and theorise with issues in society about racial and social tensions. Set in Los Angeles, the stories set in a 36 hour period include: a door fixing Dad, Cameron (Terrence Howard); a foreign store owner (Howard Fong); a racist cop, Officer John Ryan (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Matt Dillon) with Officer Tom Hansen (Cruel Intentions' Ryan Phillippe); a TV director, Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his highly strung wife, Christine (BAFTA winning Thandie Newton); a detective dogged by serious family problems, Det. Graham Walters (BAFTA nominated Don Cheadle, also producing the film); district attorney Rick (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), and two carjackers, Peter (Larenz Tate) and Anthony (rapper Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges). Also starring Jennifer Esposito as Ria, Volcano's Keith David as Lt. Dixon and Lost's Daniel Dae Kim as Park. It won the Oscars for Best Editing, Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Haggis and Robert Moresco and Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated for Best Directing for Haggis and Best Song for ""In the Deep"", it won the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Very good!"
"malcp","9","1","6","27 October 2006"," A well acted reflection on the human condition
","Taken superficially, this film would seem to be all about blatant racism and if you only look at it in that context you will miss the point. To quote a rather hackneyed phrase; 'Too err is human' and the one thing that this cast portray better than anything else is in this picture is that we all err, whether intentionally or not. We judge people and situations by any number of preconceived ideas and the only thing that reflects is the narrowness of our own vision. Our actions are more often motivated by self-interest than selflessness and yet we condemn others for behaving in exactly the same way. Many of the roles in this film can be seen as stereotypes, but it is not because of how they behave, it is because that is how they are seen through the eyes of the other characters in the film. These are not real people, and it would be easier if we did live in a world that's this tightly linked and clear cut, but despite life's complexities, our views on other people and especially those with any identifiable difference; whether age, race, creed or colour are more often than not just as simplistic, stereotyped and pathetically naive. This film's only failure from my perspective is that too many of the leads do find a redemption of sorts. If only life were really that simple."
"jennithib","9","1","6","15 August 2006"," Tight plot, understandable characters
","I thought this was an excellent movie. It's plot was strung together nicely and the characters were complex. Many complain that the movie doesn't address racism, it just show it... so? I don't think the problem of racism could be solved in a movie made for the purpose movies are made for - entertainment (after all it hasn't been solved thus far). Some also complained that we never get real motivation for the characters (why are they racist?). Isn't this a lot like life? People who are racist have an explanation that they see as justifiable, but is it? I think this may be the whole point.<br/><br/>As a daughter, wife, mother I was able to relate to these character sketches (perhaps why we don't learn a ton about them, so that they are each person could identify and relate to them in some way), I felt so much while watching this...<br/><br/>I've also read on here that people don't like the happy endings... I, personally, don't remember happy endings. For some people things are better, for some worse - I suppose it is all a matter of perspective."

","When people ask me ""What is Crash about"", It's almost impossible for me to come up with an answer. The truth is, you can't classify this movie. It's a drama, an action flick, a witty comedic piece and a testament to man kind's inability to accept one another. Every part of this movie was executed perfectly and extremely well polished. The story itself was excellent. It was exciting to observe how such a large group of people winds up weaving their lives together in a period of 24 hours. <br/><br/>The actors all put forth incredible performances in the movie. They showed their emotions so well and expressed what they were supposed to be feeling so convincingly that i wound up caring for them in the end. Surprisingly, I think the one thing that made the message of the movie so powerful was the musical score. The score for this movie was enchanting and tasteful. When used at the right moment it served to supercharge the emotions built into the movie. All in all this was an unconventional movie with an important message behind it. THis isn't one of those movies you watch once and never again, It will leave you wanting more and more, and that is a mark of a truly great film."
"mattkratz","Null","1","6","24 May 2006"," very well done
","This was one of the most powerful movies I have seen in a long time. It basically explores the prejudices just about everyone has and has a message-no one is immune. It starts off with a car accident involving two people of different ethnic backgrounds, then shifts to two black guys complaining to each other that they did not get sufficient service in a restaurant due to their skin color and then carjack Sandra Bullock's car, and then proceeds from there, never letting up and pickup up steam as it examines each character's various fears and prejudices. One such example of where no one is immune is when Ryan Philippe's character complains to his superior that his partner (Matt Dillon) is a racist, and then later finds himself in a racial situation which he handles the wrong way. Dillon's character also contradicts himself when he pulls over a black couple for no reason and feels up the wife during the interrogation. Later, he has to rescue her from a burning car. A Persian man who owns a shop also goes after a Hispanic locksmith who tries to fix his door after his store is vandalized and tries to blame him for it, leading to near-tragic circumstances.<br/><br/>No character is underdeveloped in this brilliant movie. I found myself thinking about my own life and reevaluating my values after watching it. I think it deserved the Oscar for best picture.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 out of ****"
"skowa","10","1","6","14 May 2006"," One of the most in depth, complex, and worthwhile films in recent history.
","This film has to be in the top 10 of my all time favorites! Crash at once entertains and opens the viewer's mind and heart to the lives of each of the characters. Each character was very well developed, which gives the viewer a true feel for the dilemmas facing each character. Another thing that is unique and that I liked about Crash, is that each of the primary characters, and there quite a few, had relatively equally important roles. To have removed any one character from the story line would have been to deprive the film of the depth that was necessary to reinforce the messages.<br/><br/>We did not see the more well known actors/actresses stealing the show. Instead, their roles were not any more nor any less important to the plot than the roles played by the other, perhaps lesser known actors/actresses. I am one who typically views films for their pure entertainment value, but Crash was not only entertaining, it also raised my awareness and helped me to view some aspects of life differently than I had in the past--I welcomed the lessons!<br/><br/>This film demonstrates in a rather poignant way how each of us is racist in our own ways and that each of us has the capability of being caring and compassionate. Sometimes in life it is so easy to label people as one thing or another, but this film, which I believe was very true-to-life, helps us see that if we label a person, we are taking the easy way out and failing to realize how complex each of us is. I will be recommending this film to many friends and colleagues."
"kylenewalker","8","1","6","26 April 2006"," Using racism to achieve more...
","Not just a grade-school lesson on racism, Crash is a well written and superbly acted film about strangers that meet by chance. Yes, the theme of racism that is repeated throughout the film is rather simple and contrived in that it takes the form in clichéd jokes and stereotypes, however it serves an important purpose. The tagline for the film is, ""You think you know who you are. You have no idea."" This is exactly what the film is about. A handful of people in LA who hold onto a certain belief of themselves at the start of the film are forced to re-evaluate those beliefs by the end. Writer and director Paul Haggis uses the vehicle of racism to achieve this self-reflection and purposely uses, I think, common stereotypes and jokes because the focus of the film is not to uncover the ""truth"" about racism or some other elevated goal, but to tell a story about people. <br/><br/>And I think the clichéd jokes and stereotypes work for the audience as well. For instance, in one scene the young black man, Anthony says, ""Look around! You couldn't find a whiter, safer or better lit part of this city. But this white woman sees two black guys (...) and her reaction is blind fear."" Anthony then pulls out a gun and carjacks the white woman and her husband-- and I laughed a little. Was I supposed to laugh? Was I being racist for laughing, or was it supposed to be funny? Haggis does this throughout the film to the point where some viewers might say ""okay, I get it, people are racist"" but that's not it; Haggis is trying to get viewers to reach that same self-reflective conclusion that the characters do by getting a wide range of audience members to relate to the stereotypes or clichés.<br/><br/>Overall, Crash's ensemble cast works well together with exceptional performances by Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, and Terrance Howard. The intertwining narrative keeps the story moving and the element of chance that brings the characters together does not come across as contrived but more as a gentle reminder of how we're all connected to one another."

","WOW! This movie was won of the best movies of all time. Any time I have a movie night and there is someone who hasn't seen this movie, I insist on it. I have not showed it to one person that didn't love it. It is crazy how all the stories come together in the end. It really gets me thinking how much we are all alike in certain ways. The writer covered EVERY scenario possible and still made it unpredictable. I have seen this movie at least 10 times and I still cry every time, just because it is so intense and moving. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody. The language is a little bad but really makes the movie. Some violence and sexual stuff, but it is rated ""R"" so that is expected. Great Movie overall!"
"YerYer","9","1","6","15 April 2006"," That's the way it is
","I just finished Crash, and I really like it. I like the way the story is being told. Every single shot is meaningful, no matter how countless it might seems. Every character in it has every possibility to show a different side of personality, which you would never thought he or she will be. Ones that terrified and frustrated may find his peace in a most unpredictable way; the most faithful boy died with god in his hand. Someone who did harsh and wretched things towards innocents may have a good reason; someone who was innocent and honest may become a real harm. Like Officer Ryan said in the movie: You think you know who you are. You have no idea.<br/><br/>There're aspects hidden our hearts we don't even notice for ourselves. Then how can we be so sure judging people we don't really know, not mention to those who hold tight to their prejudice and refuse any truth to change their mind.<br/><br/>It is about racism. I don't have any deep emotion toward this topic. I'm not living under the effect of it, not yet. Certainly I do hear about it a lot, and I shared my sympathy. It is ridiculous to judge people with the color of their skin; I can't even understand why people do this all these years. <br/><br/>It says there's no where else to be more mixed and complex like L.A. - people from all over the world round together. All different colors and religions, experiences and feelings, are crowded here. While none of each are not trying finding a way out. So there're Crashes. I love the first lines of the movie when Graham's voice came out from the soft music at its back: It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something. That's how we get to know each other, and that's how the story begins and ends.<br/><br/>I wont say too much about the plot, you better make out yourself, and it's totally worth it. The last thing is that I love the music in it. They're touching and are all fits, especially In the Deep, and the tail-song Maybe Tomorrow which I have put in my Shuffle for weeks."

","From a relatively obscure film a year ago, to the Best Picture Winner at the Oscar's Sunday night, the word-of-mouth on Crash spread fast. But why did it achieve such high notoriety? Simply put, this thrilling drama is a solidly played out film from start to finish. With 6 Oscar Nominations total, the film features an ensemble cast that led Academy Award host Jon Stewart to remark that, ""anyone in the audience who was not in Crash please raise their hands."" Some notable performances are in Crash from Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard, Sandra Bullock, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, Thandie Newton, and Don Cheadle. Matt and Terrence were both nominated for Oscars this year, Terrence for his role in the film Hustle & Flow. From the opening credits I was transfixed by the honesty. The characters drew me into this very day in Los Angeles where races interact, converge and prejudices beneath the surface explode in all directions. This is a fresh portrayal of race relations touching on so many emotions - hope, beauty, redemption, innocence, tenderness, tragedy, and yet even humor. You end up seeing LA as a broad representation of the USA as a whole. This film, rated R, is a melting pot filled with profound truths that does not disappoint."
"afl3","10","1","6","11 April 2006"," Crash takes an honest and accurate look at the problem of racism today.
","The film Crash is possibly one of the most inspiring films that I have ever seen. I enjoyed this film for many reasons but there are two aspects of the film that stuck with me the most -- the fact that the film treated all races equally and it made me question the way in which we are treating our fellow human beings.<br/><br/>There have been many films that focused on racism. Due to this fact, I was not all that eager to see Crash. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by the entire film. In no way did this film pin-point any one race to blame for the current problems with racism. It simply presented different scenarios in which race played a large part in the outcome of the situations. The wide variety of people, including their different races, backgrounds, and up bringing, and the obstacles in which they faced really made this film. <br/><br/>Another aspect of Crash that I enjoyed was the way that it made me feel completely differently about race all together. Sandra Bullock, one of the characters in Crash, stated in an interview that after making Crash, she will most likely not play anymore romantic comedy roles. It is as though she has realized how significant films can be and she no longer wants to make films that simply entertain. I applaud this notion. If more people would react to this film in a positive, nonjudgmental way, the world could finally begin to heal and move towards truly accepting one another."

","This movie wasn't supposed to sit there and say there is a lot of racism in the United States. WE know that as somebody already said. But, the thing it was trying to get across is that every single one of us no matter of race is racist. Yes, that means not just whites. We all have our prejudices and if you are really being honest with yourself you will agree. People talk about this saying that the oppression wasn't covered. It didn't matter. The point was blacks like everyone else can make a name for himself and not just on the criminal side. Terrance Howard's character was a TV director. Yes he had white people over him or whatever but the point is he made it there himself. That is why he makes the comment. You embarrass me. You embarrass yourself. Everyone goes through a metamorphosis in this movie. Every single person. Some went bad. Some went good. It also touches the black secretary got all offended with the comment that Dillon's character made to her. The actress's name was Loretta Devine so I don't my ass jumped into because i can remember the white guy's name but not the black woman's. You find out by the end she is just as prejudiced and racist as he is. The point is everyone is racist and if we take a step back and look at ourselves maybe just maybe we can do something about it. I hate all the racist crap but like this movie is actually trying to show you, everyone hates it. 99% of us including all races make absolutely no effort to do anything about it. All we do is whine and cry about it and expect someone else to do something or for it to fix itself. It's not going to. If we want all the bs to stop we need to do something. Whites, Blacks, Mexicans, Asians and all other races."

","I've read of lot of the negative comments on this year's Oscar winner for Best Picture, and to a certain extent I agree with the fact that Paul Haggis' script is a tad unrealistic and perhaps even a bit amateurish. His direction is indeed heavy-handed and the film, from its dialog, its acting, its soundtrack, are all so very manipulative. But you know what...so what!? I loved this film! All of the snobbish film-student types can say all they want about how bad this film is on so many levels (some levels of which the average movie-goer could care less about). I loved this film because it affected me, on not only a cerebral level (I talked about this film and discussed it with many friends and family for days) to an emotional / gut level (it has probably two of the most intense and almost horrifying scenes I've ever experienced in cinema). This film goes for your heart and gut and crushes it and squishes it and makes you uncomfortable, but leaves you hopeful at the end. Will you experience this film in the same intense way that I felt? Perhaps - and then again, perhaps not. But you will experience something, and it will AFFECT you...positively or negatively. And that's what I love about the cinema and this film.<br/><br/>A worthy recipient of the Oscars! Go see it for yourself and make your own judgments!"
"haloboy-1","9","1","6","28 March 2006"," Too Subtle?
","Just recently rented Crash. None of the online friends I usually discuss things with have seen it so I thought I'd toddle on over to the IMDb board. Was I ever surprised to see so any negative reviews. What really interested me, though, was the complaint that the movie had no subtlety. Interesting because many of the same reviewers elaborated by pointing out how pat was the redemption of the character of Anthony. Well, no wonder these people think there is no subtlety here.<br/><br/>It is clear that Anthony thinks his act qualifies him for redemption. But he has learned nothing. He is still under the impression that those people he released were Chinese just because they are Asian and so dumps them off in Chinatown. By doing this to them though they have no way to communicate, no understanding of the value of the 40 dollars he magnanimously gives them, and little hope of finding a welcome by a different culture from their own what he has done parallels what the white abolitionists patted themselves on the back for and what they have been vilified for in some circles by freeing the slaves without providing the tools they needed to prosper. Do you think the Cambodians will thank Anthony for leaving them to deal with the different set of perils he has so smugly and self-righteously exposed them to? Do you think they should? <br/><br/>For more subtlety lets take a look at Thandie Newton's character. Thandie Newton the actress is bi-racial. She was obviously chosen for this part not only because she is a fine fine actress but because of her obvious racial make up. So when her character is berating her husband for being an ""Uncle Tom"" did anyone notice that she finds no comparison to what she is doing by embracing only the white side of her heritage?<br/><br/>I haven't seen anyone mention the implied affair between the DA and his assistant that goes a ways towards exploring just what it is that makes Sandra Bullock's character so miserably angry. Perhaps if they had been shown in a clinch then the poster who complained about the fleeting glimpse of the box of blanks could then complain about the dumbing down of this slightly suggested wrinkle that few seemed to notice. And do those who complain how trite it is that everyone is redeemed in the end really think that Sandra Bullock's character is going to continue being best friends with her maid once she is again up and around and off the painkillers? <br/><br/>Another complaint is the racial stereotype the movie is accused of promoting and a case is made about the crack addicted African American mother. But the important dynamic here is the one between parents and their children. It is not only crack addicted African American mothers who pay more attention to their difficult child than to their good one. It is not only crack addicted African American mothers who place the burden of parenting a much younger sibling on the oldest child, often forgetting that the oldest sibling is also a child in need of the parent's attention and approval. This movie chose to depict a parent who places the burden of parenting a younger sibling on an older one so that we can see his ultimate moral dilemma. This movie chose to depict a parent grasping at any small thing the bad child does(or might have done) as proof of his goodness while ignoring all of the large things the good child does that deserves approbation. But because the movie chose to make that parent a crack addicted African American single mother everyone says, to quote Matt Dillon's character, ""Well, that's just typical"" not even realizing it is their prejudice showing.<br/><br/>So to those who thought the movie had no subtlety I suggest that the irony is that the truth is the movie was too subtle for them.<br/><br/>Diane Margaret"

Not only does it expose important issues of our society today, it does it in a way the doesn't preach and isn't cheesy. The emotion that is shown by the actors in this movie is phenomenal - people like Brendan Fraser and Sandra bullock who have not necessarily been in the most serious of movies (props to Brendan for With Honors and School Ties), they do a masterful job of making you believe they are who they are portraying. I think the best acting portrayals in the movie were the male parts played by Terrence Howard (who is becoming a powerhouse) and Matt Dillon (who played the role so perfectly I hated him while watching but still understood his frustrations). Movies like this bring issues to light that are often taboo and more often are portrayed as lectures to our society that turn people off and don't have any lasting effect. This movie will be remembered."

","The issue of racism is blended seamlessly into the story. The life of 7 couples (white policemen, black TV personnel, black car thieves, Persian shopowners, Latino locksmith, white District Attorney, black detectives and Mexican woman detective) are interwined. Not to disclose too much, the stories behind these people come alive on the screen. Here racism knows no ends - those suffering from racial discrimination on the other hand discriminate against people of another colour. Yet racism alone would not hold the movie together, relationship does and the director succeeds in bringing out love-hate relationship between husband and wife, brothers, bad cop and citizen, father/mother and son. In the movie, people are not just good or bad - grey areas abound. Trust, or rather distrust, lead to tragedy at worst or reconciliation at best.<br/><br/>The scene that impressed me most is when the biased Sandra Bullock hugged her domestic helper, finally realised her own vulnerability and called the helper her best friend.<br/><br/>This movie deserves the Oscar for Best movie. Curiously, when I watched the movie, never did I associate racism to any city in the U.S. nor ponder whether any part of the story can actually be real. Rather, I feel bias exists in human nature, in any parts of the world and to a varied extent. Very worth watching."
"GloriaT","9","1","6","18 March 2006"," Living and Hating in L.A.
","""Crash"" has been called a film about racism, a description which nails its leitmotif but fails to do justice to an engrossing film about a variety of people loving and hating in L.A.<br/><br/>The movie, written, directed and co-produced by Caucasian Canadian Paul Haggis, comes at its subject matter from so many angles it might even appeal to some racists! ""Crash"" provides plenty of drama to keep the enjoyment level high while a mixed bag of racial and ethnic stereotypes parades in front of the camera lens. As the pieces to the puzzle-like narrative fall into place, we are shown ostensible reasons for racism, but also persons who refuse to give in to hate. ""Crash"" also dares to point out that there are no guarantees: someone's racially motivated judgment may turn out to be accurate in a particular instance. Without moralizing or even leaving us with a moral at the end of the story, ""Crash"" does, however, lament the ultimately losing proposition racism represents -- whether it is practiced by an individual or a bureaucracy. The anger and hatred recycled throughout the City of Angels by the racially prejudiced characters in this film is shown to be a destructive force that takes a human toll.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock plays a district attorney's wife, defined by attendant privilege. When she is traumatized by armed carjackers, it brings out the bile of her biased views. Bullock's performance is absolutely raw; she is a woman alone with her anger, whose husband (Brendan Fraser) is more involved with political damage control than reconnecting with his spouse after their harrowing experience.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon is a cop who blames ""the job"" for his lack of humanity and the dehumanizing way he interacts with others, whether they are African-Americans, women, Hispanics or rookie cops. And it is ""the job"" which will ultimately define him.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle, also a co-producer, plays a police detective whose senile mother blames him for the misspent life of his younger brother (Larenz Tate), an otherwise intelligent kid, who just happens to practice armed robbery. Cheadle's character is all too well aware of the ramifications of race on his job and in his department. However, he is paralyzed to act against it by the same world-weariness, acquired from years of chasing down bad guys, that arguably allows him to continue to function in his job while caring for his increasingly helpless mother.<br/><br/>Rookie officer Hanson (Ryan Philippe) is disgusted by gratuitous abuse. But his instincts are not yet honed enough for him to successfully navigate the hard-to-predict world of cops and robbers.<br/><br/>An African-American TV director (Terrence Howard) is forced by events to re-examine his place in society. When and where he chooses to make his stand might reflect the stranglehold of ""the man"" or it might just hold the key to real social change. Viewers will decide for themselves. <br/><br/>Thandie Newton delivers a performance of wide-ranging authentic emotions in her pivotal role as Cameron's wife. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges plays Anthony, the garrulous ""Go To"" guy in a gang of two. Armed and delusional, he rants about conspiracy theories on racially charged themes, while preying upon solid citizens. But when his snub-nose is wrested from him during an attempted carjacking, Anthony is symbolically emasculated, and he freezes in fearful helplessness. Afterward he slips back into his criminal routine, but Anthony may have found religion or at least a moral line on the asphalt that he is not ready to cross.<br/><br/>In one subplot we watch a loving father provide for his preschool daughter while trying to keep her safe from gun violence. At the same time, a caring adult daughter reluctantly helps her angry storekeeper father purchase a gun he is convinced he needs for his protection. The unlikely convergence of these separate households plays out like a karmic ballet. <br/><br/>At times in ""Crash"" it seems as if L.A. is home to only hateful people. But amid all the useless bluster we are also given a glimpse of the potential for a racially harmonious future. It lies within the grasp of each of us, literally: the same hands that violate, can also save and console.<br/><br/>""Crash"" also holds up the inherent innocence of children as part of the plan for a better future. Aligned against this hope is a formidable adversary: the prejudice alive in men's hearts and society's institutions. Adults may have the power to create a fairy-tale world for their offspring, and children may have the naïveté needed to fully believe in that world, but beliefs built on purity don't often survive as we mature into adulthood.<br/><br/>""Crash"" teeters at times on a cliff of conspicuous contrivance and melodrama, but its in-your-face attitude, the praiseworthy lyricism of James Muro's cinematography and an emotive musical score keep it from plunging over the edge.<br/><br/>In the big city, with its fast pace, complex institutions and disparate populations, it is all too expeditious to misjudge based on skin shade or language. ""Crash"" leaves its audience questioning the wisdom of basing important choices on such insignificant matters."

","I remember watching the TV commercials for ""Crash"" when the movie was still in theaters. The commercials emphasized Sandra Bullock, America's sweetheart, as a foul mouthed, mean spirited, rich, rigid, racist white woman, and Ludicrous as a witty, charismatic, black carjacker.<br/><br/>""Oh, no,"" I thought, ""just what we need. More Hollywood Limousine Liberal one-dimensional pablum about how we should just all get along. Another 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.'"" A funny thing happened, though. Many acquaintances, from a variety of backgrounds, approached me to urge me to see the film. They were moved by this movie in a way that I haven't seen people be moved by a movie in years.<br/><br/>Then, when ""Crash"" won the Academy Award for best picture, I thought, okay, I need to see this, even if just as a cultural artifact.<br/><br/>Boy, was I surprised. ""Crash"" was nothing like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" except in that it has a great cast.<br/><br/>The script is sharp and fast and literate. Characters manage to say memorable things without sounding artificial (for the most part.) I miss Joe Mankiewicz. I miss great scripts. ""Crash"" is a treat for fans of language.<br/><br/>The cast is just, plain, unbelievably fine. Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Tony Danza -- who would have guessed that these stars could have done the kind of intensely moving work that they do here? Matt Dillon gave a performance, and created a character, that I will simply never forget.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, and Loretta Devine are also great, but not as surprising, because they don't play against type. The actors playing a Persian shop keeper and his daughter, a locksmith ... Each performance is stunning, perfect, moving.<br/><br/>Terrence Howard ... what can I say? I'm running out of words. Terrence Howard was exquisitely moving.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillipe. Keith David.<br/><br/>Just, standing on my chair, applauding. This movie gave me a whole new appreciation of acting as a profession.<br/><br/>""Crash"" consists of one stunning moment after another that wrenches both with its realness and its artistic merit. I've lived some of those moments: a father reassures his daughter with a tale of a protective cloak; a woman embraces someone whom she suddenly recognizes as a friend; a man says he doesn't want to apologize any more; a son tries to help his ill father.<br/><br/>Most movies would be lucky to create one such scene.<br/><br/>Some have argued that the movie is contrived. To those folks I'll report: movies *are* contrived. See, Matt Dillon is not actually a police officer ...<br/><br/>I didn't find one moment of ""Crash"" to be unbelievable. We've all had moments of coincidence that defied chance. That's why the word ""synchronicity"" exists.<br/><br/>Others objected that the movie is preachy. I've really got to wonder about the lives of the folks who found this movie preachy. I live in a very multicultural, multiracial world. Events like those in ""Crash"" happen in the world I inhabit. Unlikely allies do form. People do sell out. Deals are cut. Rescues are made, and lives are lost. How is depicting these realities on screen ""preachy""? I'm wary of overuse of words like ""preachy"" and ""manipulative"" in film reviews. They tend to be used by people who like movies shot through gauze in the South of France where the only thing that happens is that Charlotte Rampling gazes off soulfully into the distance.<br/><br/>I think many, too, had a problem with what is on screen in ""Crash."" The white supremacist bad guy everyone is primed to hate is revealed to be a complex human being. Blacks are not depicted as blameless; some steal, are rude, and make racist comments. I think that that bit of reality will disturb some movie goers.<br/><br/>Some argued that the movie ends too neatly. I didn't see any neat ending. In the end, there is life, and there is death, and mere chance separates the two. The final sounds in the movie are a new racial confrontation beginning.<br/><br/>The film's sheer artistry, and its soundtrack, make all the horror it exposes bearable. This movie left me exhilarated. If we can produce movies like this, maybe we can learn to all just get along."
"princessreject","7","1","6","13 March 2006"," Inspiring
","When I first heard of Crash, the first thought of mine was 'Oh great another political feel good movie skating over the real issues of society'. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a truly mesmerising and inspiring film, showing the troubling issue of racism still found in our society at the moment, portrayed through the lives of various strong and diverse characters. I won't say a lot as there are not enough words to reflect how deep and astonishing this movie is. What stuck out for me the most was the truly outstanding performances from each and every actor included in this film, which is a rare sight. In particular, appearances from actors such as Thandie newton, Ryan Phillipe and Don Cheadle really made me believe whole heartedly what message the film was trying to get across to the public. Furthermore, the emotional, hard hitting story line made me acknowledge the true conflicts of our world, and more than once I was overwhelmed with tears. I may sound sensitive. I may sound cheesy. But I will always remember how Crash forced me to unlock emotions I never knew I had. It deserved the best picture Oscar, and a hell of a lot more. If you want to see a worth while exhilarating, emotive film (with some raunchy love scenes to boot), I recommend this classic."
"kareem-1","9","1","6","12 March 2006"," Americana Microcosm - The Best Picture
","This movie sat on top of my DVD player for weeks. Tonight, I figured ""what the hell, I'll TIVO the Soprano's premiere, and see what all the fuss is about. I've been lucky enough to see all this years nominees for Best Picture, and I had to say I was pulling for Capote, until tonight <br/><br/>Crash is one of the most fascinating movies I've seen in years. Great ensemble-cast movies like this seem to keep sprouting up (Two Days in the Valley, Full Frontal, Happy Endings and I Heart Huckabees), but none speak to the audience (about the audience) like Crash. Heck; I nearly cried at one point (don't tell anyone). Cheadle, Phillippe, Bullock, Fraser (when was the last time you saw him in good movie), Dillon, Terrence ""whoop, that Trick"" Howard, and Thandie Newton all perform in ways that we haven't seen in years and what was up with Ludicrous - that kid can really act - somewhat! <br/><br/>Forget the philosophical reasoning behind Crash and you end up with a story built upon a city. Los Angeles isn't like any other town in America. Being a New Yorker and living in DC, having been to Orlando, Baltimore, Iowa City (so friendly, it's almost scary) and Chicago. You realize that people in LA don't really play by the same rules as the rest of us. Even though it's a perfect example of Microcosm Americana. No matter how, fervently we say ""we're all Americans and we all deserve the respect and tolerance"". There is still a lot of racist and intolerant BS that still carries on within our borders and towns. Racial tensions run so high, because everyone's insulated in their own comfy little worlds, and when someone from another world interacts with theirs, they freak. Crash, shows you a range of emotions between all these types of people, but unlike most ensemble movies, their stories don't intermingle perfectly to that pinhead point at the end. Loose ends are left, your left wondering, and the credits roll. Perfectly done. <br/><br/>It's a rare and exceptional feat to witness a film in which you are forced to look at yourself - what you believe - how we look and interact with our neighbors and even strangers; and ask why. Why do I act this way, why do I continue feel this way toward other human beings that have done nothing to me or mine?"
"OneThousandThings","10","1","6","12 March 2006"," It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know?
","It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something.<br/><br/>The opening quote of this movie demonstrates the lack of a connection between members of our society. Although Los Angeles is the city specifically mentioned in the quote, LA symbolizes our American society as a whole. The speaker, Graham, has the belief that we are looking for a connection to each other. We cannot find this connection on an emotional level which is what would be ideal, so we find it on a physical level where we ""crash into each other"" in a figurative way. Although the ""crashing"" is figurative, literal violence can be a way of ""crashing"". An example of this happening in the film is the Persian shop keeper ""crashing into"" Daniel the locksmith. The shop keeper lacks a connection to society that is mostly due to a language barrier; his spoken English is fairly poor and he is unable to read English but he has to work with people who speak and write only English on a daily basis. He feels isolated from society and is unable to obtain an emotional connection with anyone except his wife and daughter. He has trouble communicating with Daniel the locksmith which leads to his shop being robbed. After he feels like he has lost everything, he comes to the conclusion that Daniel must have robbed his store. He makes the decision to find Daniel and threaten him to get his money back. The crash occurs when the shopkeeper pulls his gun out. He fires it toward Daniel but Daniel's daughter jumps in front of him so that the shot is fired at her. The result is great distress for only several moments, most likely about ten to fifteen seconds. The shopkeeper is distressed because he thinks that he has killed a child and Daniel is distressed because he thinks his daughter has been killed. Because there were blanks in the gun, Daniel's daughter is not killed. The end result of the crash is the shopkeeper feeling like his life is not over and Daniel feeling grateful for his daughter's life.<br/><br/>One truth of American society that is depicted in this film is that racism can be found in most everyone. There is more to the movie, but this is the most prominent theme and easiest to talk about. The director, Paul Haggis shows this by revealing racism toward and by many different races instead of just focusing on two different races. Many other films have made themes with racism of white people toward black people, occasionally black people toward white people. More films have depicted, but rarely made a theme of, racism toward Latino minorities. However, this movie showed all different angles of racism such as black to Asian, Asian to white, white to Middle Eastern, Middle Eastern to Latino and almost any other mixtures of these races. Paul Haggis also showed the truth of racism by portraying how the little, every-day type of comments that we usually ignore or maybe laugh at can be hurtful. As these comments were spread to others, anger in society grew."

","Plot Outline: For two days in Los Angeles, a racially and economically diverse group of people come together in unexpected incidents. Characters include a black detective looking for his brother, two car thieves always discussing racism in society, a racist cop with a sick father and his idealistic partner, a black director and his wife, a Persian immigrant shopkeeper and a Hispanic locksmith.<br/><br/>Comment: Paul Haggis struck gold with Million Dollar Baby's adapted script and has done it again with Crash. What's better is that he's directed it himself. Crash doesn't actually narrate a story but takes a slice out of time in LA. The opening narrative about impersonal life in LA and the depiction of prejudices and preconceived notions of characters built on their own biased experiences form the foundation of the movie. The slow pace of enhances the intensity of the movie and helps audience get closer to the characters.<br/><br/>Crash has many good moments and good dialogues. Notable ones include the Locksmith's little girl and the cloak, the second brush between Officer Ryan, a racist cop played by Matt Dillon and Thandie Newton. Lots of Good and Bad sides of people are depicted. What sets Crash apart is that it gives insights into how and why of the Good and Bad which is not a common occurrence in movies. Despite all the intensity, you wouldn't want to hate any character in the movie. Crash is recommended for those who love intense movies. So, take some time out to catch up with a slice of time from LA.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","6","9 February 2006"," Crash Touches
","Few movies are thought provoking. Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" is conscience provoking. In the opening scene of ""Crash"" Don Cheadle as Detective Graham says, ""In L.A. nobody touches you."" Director Paul Haggis and co-writer Robert Moresco touch and inspire in their stark and uncompromising story of bigotry, racism, and prejudice. Haggis and Moresco illustrate through the chaos of colliding characters the prejudice that exists in all of us. Prejudice is not really good or bad, rather it just doesn't work. Haggis and Moresco also celebrate the possibility of the best in peoplethe part that is noble, courageous, selfless, and forgiving. In his directorial debut, Paul Haggis is bold and brilliant. The cast which includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Terrance Howard, Brendan Fraser, Thandie Newton, and Ryan Phillipe is impeccable.<br/><br/>With its intertwining narrative threads ""Crash"" is truly the director's medium. Haggis is uncompromising in his portrait of prejudice in both broad and subtle strokes. The effect is powerful. Two young black men, Anthony (Ludacis) and Peter (Larenz Tate), carjack the Navigator owned by district attorney Rick (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). Following a lead on the stolen Navigator, police officers Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Hanson (Ryan Phillipe) stop Navigator driver Cameron (Terrence Howard) and his beautiful wife Christine (Thandie Newton) for really no good reason. Ryan crosses the line and literally violates Christine in front of an impotent Cameron. Persian store owner Farhad (Shaun Toub) and his daughter Shereen are labeled Arab by a gun store owner when they purchase a handgun to protect Farhad's store. Hispanic locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena) is dismissed by an angry Farhad, when Daniel recommends that he repair the store door, because the replaced locks only are insufficient. Graham (Cheadle) and his partner and lover Ria (Jennifer Esposito) are investigating a the shooting of an undercover cop. Graham is also taking care of his ailing mother, and has a brother who is career liability.<br/><br/>The surprise and power of ""Crash"" is in the story unfolding. This is intended not to give anything way. Haggis eloquently and poignantly reveals that all is not what it seemspointing to our own prejudgment. The beauty of ""Crash"" is that we the audience gets to walk in ""another's shoes"". Sandra Bullock is amazing and compelling as the seemingly unsympathetic rich bigoted wife Jean. Her Jean has a realization: ""I am angry all the time and I don't know why."" The catharsis for her is that she is the reason she is so alone. Matt Dillon is electrifying as Officer Ryan, who is both an enforcer of stereotypes and a man capable of great courage and compassion. Don Cheadle is a commanding presence. His Graham is caught in a racially black and white world, where decisions are gray. Cheadle has this quiet strength of will and profound humanity as he makes things work with Ria (Esposito), his mother, and his life. No one gets out unscathed. No one is the villain. Everyone is humanthe great paradox. Shakespeare said of Man, ""the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust?"" ""Crash"" depicts our individual prejudices, and also our innate nobility and capacity for compassion. Through ""Crash"" Haggis seems to say that it comes down to choice. ""Crash"" is an absolutely powerful movie that lives with you well beyond the screen."

","Crash is a very powerful and moving film with some hugely memorable scenes that will be remembered for a long time. Although I did find the first half to be quite slow and repetitive in places the second half completely blew me away, which in the end fully justifies the first. All the characters are from different backgrounds and races and most people will find some one to whom they can relate. It is unnoticeably a film about racism, it's a topic the drives each story, although there are still noticeable sub-topics along the way, it never strays to far from its central theme. Its messages are clear and important, it shows racism from every possible angle, and that's one of the reasons it has such a powerful effect and has gained so much praise. Personally I found it hard to connect with at first, as I am white, living in a white area of a white town, in England, which is primarily a white country. Added to that I'm not racist, so it's a topic I know little about, yet it still managed to draw me in and I came away all the better for it.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful film both visually and emotionally, with well rounded characters, an outstanding script, and mind blowing performances all round. It's a well crafted and thoroughly enjoyable drama that I highly recommend.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","""Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing ever happened"". Sir Winston Churchill.<br/><br/>This is a film about those moments. It's about epiphany, in the non-religious sense. The characters are revealed to us, and then we see them caught up in some event - for each of them, an event which runs totally contrary to their nature, beliefs and identity. An event which challenges them in powerful and extreme ways. And thankfully, I think their view of the world is permanently transformed - they don't hurry off as if nothing ever happened.<br/><br/>I loved this film. It's well acted, immersive, thought-provoking and full of surprises. The characters are portrayed with great sympathy, I had no difficulty understanding and relating to their dilemmas. In fact the whole thing is done with such skill that the emotional impact on me seemed almost as much as it would have been on the characters themselves.<br/><br/>I have not seen a better film from 2005 and I doubt whether you have either."

Don Cheadle is, as always, excellent.<br/><br/>I was initially a little put off by Haggis's approach to characterisation, as, in it's first quarter, the script is really an essay on the angst of liberal white America, but as the film develops archetypes and expectations are both successfully reinforced and undermined  a neat trick, if it can be pulled off, which it is here. In one case  the tale of an immigrant shop owner angered into irresponsibly taking up arms - a whole series of cinematic clichés seem to be converging, only for the rug to be pulled out from the audience at the last moment  the consequence of which almost had me in tears.<br/><br/>It's that rarest of Hollywood beasts, an ensemble piece  borrowing a little from the style of Altman's 'Short Cuts' and Anderson's (underrated) 'Magnolia', with story-arcs featuring seemingly unrelated characters having a domino-effect on other tales and characters. It's easy for characterisation to suffer when there's a concerted effort to join-the-dots between plot lines, but for the most part this process is handled with subtlety, and there's not a bad performance in the whole thing."

The directors have taken ever single step possible to make a story that is easy to follow, yet inter-related, complex, and honestly disturbing.<br/><br/>Growing up in white-bread suburbia doesn't often expose you to racial tension, but that doesn't mean that the movie doesn't apply. The acting by all the players is so believable that you are taken to their world, and you feel for a second as if you are in inter-city LA struggling alongside these characters.<br/><br/>In the end the movie is certainly emotionally charged, and good for all people to see, if only to illustrate for them how important it is to be accepting of all different kinds of people."

","I started to watch a DVD of this movie in a dull weekend night, and just 10 minutes later I was fully attracted by it. The screen play and picture narration is TV style, but much better and natural then those ""24 hours""s. The movie is full of touching scene and inspirations from the beginning to the rest. As a foreigner in the country, the movie make me thinking and imagination. It is very dramatic, mixed with sentimental, violent, funny, love, trusty and educative elements. It has a very rich content and expandable meanings. The music is terrific. The director and screen cutting is smooth and well connected. It is a comfortable movie, a poet washing you mind but never sermonic. Go and watch it, if you like it, it worth buying a DVD for collection.<br/><br/>I think it reaches the level of another great work: ""The God must be crazy"". We are lucky watching such kind of movies, and more lucky, not to watch too many of them."
"fernanda-unique","9","1","6","12 January 2006"," A Different Movie
","I think CRASH is amazing. It is about the difference of cultures living together in a single country (US). The film is a narrative, telling different histories at the same time, with flashbacks and interaction of the characters: very creative and soft. Its purpose is to observe and reflect on your own. Is violence a cultural or racial or social cause or is it part of all human beings? It is realistic, in a global society peoples' behavior is becoming more and more primitive in a complex and contradictory way. You should see it, it is not so simple as it seems. Although we have several prejudices belonging to the past and passing though generations, do we really hope to rest in peace? Or is it very confusing to be apart, almost internally impossible to be treat differently, causing a most defensive, but yet aggressive behavior?"

","There have been a lot of multi-plot line movies in recent years, such as Magnolia and Traffic, not to mention Life is a Dog.

It tells a number of linked stories essentially involving racism.<br/><br/>Each little story is told so efficiently and profoundly that any one could have been worked into a full story.<br/><br/>Some characters will be redeemed, others will miss the chance for redemption, and some will fall, but there is also hope because of mood of redemption in this movie. The cold and the snow is a metaphor for this. When it cold enough it can snow and that changes the mood of everything.<br/><br/>The interlinking does seem over contrived, the attempts at humour are pathetic and some of this analysis of people and characterisation is a little off.

It challenges our preconceptions, both of racism and of how we imagine the direction the movie will take.

","As a Star Wars fan, I feel obliged to say Revenge Of The Sith was the best movie of the year. But in my unbiased and honest opinion, Crash is hands down the best movie of 2005. The performances blew me away. Before seeing this movie, I didn't think Sandra Bullock was a great actress, but didn't think she was a terrible one either. This movie changed that. In the scene when Sandra confronts Rick about being carjacked, she proved she can really light up the screen. But one performance that took me by surprise was the one by Ludicrous. He delivered a good performance. The racism that each character expresses and experiences is really a wake up call. And one of the most famous (infamous?) scenes in the movie-with the Persian store owner and the little girl-is some of the best movie making I've seen. I tell you, when what people thought was a loaded gun went off on the little girl, there were quite a few teary eyes in the theater I was in. Thank god those were blanks huh? Anyway, if this movie is not nominated for at least 1 Oscar that is absolutely ridiculous. But hey, if Shakespeare In Love can beat Saving Private Ryan for best picture, who knows what might happen at this year's Oscars.<br/><br/>A perfect 10/10, as you have seen above. Highly recommended."

","I thought I'd add some lyrics by the band Ween to the review as I've never been to America, let alone L.A.<br/><br/>The film is all about mistakes. Mistakes that someone living in a British community reading newspapers and watching television news know will not burden their lives through laws which they are not governed by, most directly, gun control. Or dreams of living as large as America, and making errors of judgement from thinking on such grandiose scales which is where the racial tension inherent in this movie could well be derived from.<br/><br/>What the movie does is show a big city interacting on a very small scale from the police department to television producers and petty criminals on the wrong side of the fence and pick their lives apart only to fake a reformation of the jigsaw puzzle at the end.<br/><br/>In many ways the Stella cast reminds me of a group of conniving union delegates who know they have done wrong and commissioned somebody to write a movie that doesn't hide this fact, and quite the opposite, implores you to join them. Bums on seats? No, more go out and buy a Matt Dillon shaped dildo and sit on it the night before your first period starts.<br/><br/>What the film can't hide from the back of my mind is the tragic occurrences witnessed recently in the US, not the ones that happen daily; things for which someone is to blame and no matter how hard I try, watching this movie brings to mind but one answer: blame America. There, a happy ending, after all."
"Sylviastel","10","1","6","31 December 2005"," Breathtaking, horrifying, and yet probably the best film of the year!
","In Hollywood, they should just look outside their walls and gates for a good story. They don't have to travel very far. The story of Crash is complicated to describe but it is an ensemble piece with an excellent cast like Matt Dillon who plays the racist cop with sick father at home fighting with an African American HMO representative for coverage. He takes his anger out on a successful African American couple. Thandie Newton is unrecognizable and believable as the light skinned wife of a successful television director who gets felt up by Dillon's character and humiliated but in the end, there is something called redemption that these characters seek and need to prove that they are not the cruel, heartless, caricatures of society. Matt Dillon's character is a veteran Los Angeles Police Detective but a racist filled with anger and hatred. I hope he is not overlooked for his performance in this film. By the end of it, I wanted more and I saw this film on an airplane screen but I was glued to every word and scene. Brendan Fraser is miscast as the Los Angeles District Attorney. He is just too young. I love William Fichtner who has been around for years and finally getting noticed. Sandra Bullock is wonderfully complicated as Brendan's wife. They both survive a carjacking and are distrustful. The Persian man who loses his place of business because of a break-in and vandalism is also heartbreaking but you end up liking him and feeling sorry for him in the end but who suddenly has hope for the future despite losing everything to hatred. This film is a lot about hatred, prejudice, racism, sexism, and it is also about redemption of the characters. Don Cheadle is also wonderful in his role. I hope the Oscars don't forget about them one bit. It's the film that is worth watching again and again. You want more when it's over and you wonder why Hollywood doesn't make films about life in Los Angeles. Finally, the Oscars votes came in and Crash won. The controversy over the other film is ridiculous and the most absurd. This film was not meant to win an Oscar for best film. It was the little film that could. When Haggis directed it, he was not thinking about how many awards this would win for him but the message of optimism in a pessimistic society. I'm glad Crash won over the other film. Roger Ebert named this film of the year in his annual top ten. The other film came in 5. In my opinion, I think the Academy was right in selecting this film. Yes, this film has just as much controversy as the other film does. I won't name it because it's not worth mentioning. It was the upset of the night and I would have loved to have watched it on television but I fell asleep and woke up to the news."

Twists and turns, deeply human and personal; emotionally draining in some tense scenes; wonderful story-telling; laughs that suddenly hook you into high drama.

Everybody is the good guy(strictly no pun intended), all of these everybody's are also the bag guys, but what ""Crash"" wants to show us is the shift between these two states in each of these people. It succeeds with flying colors. This is a goose-bump movie and I was consuming the screen with my eyes like it was the last movie I was ever going to see. Very precisely and tactfully paced, ""Crash"" knows when and why to show something-no screen time is wasted for making moments appear more (or less for that matter) than they are. Paul Haggis, the director, also had a very clear vision of why hiring known, even super-star actors/actresses was going to pay off. He succeeded something remarkable, not one! of these names stands out in the movie as the predominant one, quite the contrary, its the events around them that take that place.

It makes every person, no matter what race or ethnicity or walk of life they come from stop and think about their reactions to people. Our world has gotten smaller, faster, and more expensive. Somewhere in the rush of technology we have lost the human contact that our world was once built on and sometimes we are so desperate for that contact that we just crash into each other because even contact in anger is better than nothing at all.

While watching this movie, the viewer can identify not only with characters of their ethnic background, but also with situations and circumstances. It leaves you wanting to analyze each and every character as well as their circumstances and how it relates to you on a personal level.

How often we let the past experiences, stories etc. affect our future behavior. How we all have this so called notions about people: be it color of skin or religion or geography etc. But what this beautiful director unfolds in the movie is that this very concept of prejudging people is the cause that bad people still remain bad. <br/><br/>The director has masterfully portrayed how the prejudices can be wrong and how people whom we fear/hate/ try to stay away from, can go out of their ways to help us. This movie talks about the heart of a person which is pure and the pureness resides in each and every person. All we need is to give the person a chance.<br/><br/>I salute the director.

","I can't stand cops, or couldn't until I saw this movie. I told my grandson not to major in Criminal Justice because police see the worst of people and sometimes become like them in order to survive. Not so a firefighter. Matt Dillon, doing the best acting of his life, portrays a rotten cop and a good cop, going from worst to best and nearly giving up his life in the process of saving another. Talk about the Bible Illustrated!!! ""Giving up your life for your brother""...what a portrayal!!! Especially when the savior is also the molester!!! Now flip it and Crash gives us the other side: as the rookie cop, disgusted by the abuse of the Dillon cop, works his new assignment, he saves the black movie director's life who is trying to perform 'suicide by cop'. But then, doing another Good Samaritan deed, he winds up killing another black guy for nothing but a St. Christopher's medal that he thought was a gun in the kid's pocket.<br/><br/>This will remind you of Robert Altman's films as all these various ethnic types have their lives intertwined, and a nigh-fatal occurrence goes down because of the lack of understanding and communication between the Iraqi and the Hispanic (funny, the description calls him 'Persian').<br/><br/>The only mysterious character is the D.A.'s wife, played by Sandra Bullock. I never understood why she was always so angry. Nor did I understand what the D.A. was having to explain. This movie is so rich with so many subplots, you really need to see it multiple times. I was so busy keeping up with who was who that I sometimes thought I was involved with the detective when I was actually with the D.A.<br/><br/>It started to get too 'Hollywood' with magic saving people's lives, until one didn't get his life saved. The portrayal of the compromises we human being make to get through life, to get ahead in our careers, was devastating. ""Forsake all others and come after me"". ""He who would save his life must lose it, for my sake."" or the Biblical verse: ""If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out"". The axiom: ""He who returns evil for evil is human, he who returns evil for good is monstrous, but he who returns good for evil is saintly."" will occur to you more than once as you watch this very excellent ""CLEARED for Sunday SCHOOL LESSONS"" film. It is not profanity and sex that is evil: it is murder, corruption of the soul, greed, and thievery of both goods and one's good name, as epitomized by the Bush administration and represented here."
"hall895","9","1","6","7 October 2005"," A brilliant ensemble cast in a brilliant film
","A riveting and explosive drama, Crash is a simply terrific film. Exploring issues of race in a brilliant manner the film manages to be thought-provoking and eye-opening and yet still entertaining and thoroughly engrossing. Crash follows a widely disparate cast of characters in Los Angeles where people's prejudices and assumptions color the way they see others and ultimately impact their own destiny. We follow over a dozen central characters and explore the ways in which the fates of these people, seemingly with no connection to one another, all become intertwined. It's a tangled web and a fascinating one to explore.<br/><br/>If one actor had to be singled out as the star of the picture it would be Don Cheadle as a black cop being pulled in many different directions. His family, his superiors and his Latina female partner, who he also happens to be sleeping with, all want something different from him and the plot can be said to revolve around him. Cheadle gives a terrific performance but there are many other actors doing excellent work portraying varied characters, each of whom have their own unique and well-developed story. Particularly noteworthy are Matt Dillon as a racist cop, Terrence Howard as a successful black television director, Michael Pena as a Hispanic locksmith who is also a loving father and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges as a young man who has chosen a rather interesting career path. In somewhat lesser roles the likes of Sandra Bullock, Jennifer Esposito, Thandie Newton, Ryan Philippe and Larenz Tate all do fine work. There are other less-familiar faces who also turn in very good performances. Perhaps the only casting misstep is Brendan Fraser as the Los Angeles district attorney. Fraser really isn't plausible in the role, not having the appropriate sense of seriousness and experience required. But his screen time is mercifully short, not nearly enough to detract from all the terrific performances around him.<br/><br/>Cross-cutting between characters, following so many different stories that all tie in to one another somehow, Crash is a thrilling ride. It is full of suspense, has many, many moments of great drama and sheer terror, and all along is filled with raw, genuine, honest, in-your-face emotion. It is certainly a movie with a message yet you do not feel as if you are being preached to. The story is simply laid out there for you to see for yourself the consequences which prejudices and false assumptions can have. It is a brilliantly conceived story which is performed wonderfully by a superb cast. One cannot ask for much more than that."

However even though I can't truly relate to other races, I can certainly sympathize, and have gained a better understanding of the reasons for the tension between different social classes. Also, unless you get really angry if someone looks at you funny, you shouldn't find this movie offending.

To my great disappointment it is nothing more than just another Hollywood production where everything is simple, there is no gray and the good cowboy will come to the rescue at the end of the film. I think films like these are frivolous and even dangerous, they may leave you with the idea that you've seen something 'that really makes you think' while in fact the stereotypes have just been reinforced.

","SPOILERS One of the largest problems in the modern world is this on going issue of race. Whilst an improvement on the 1960s, there is little point denying that racism still exists in the world. Stereotypes are as powerful today as ever and people live in fear or hatred of another due to the colour of their skin. In Paul Haggis' ""Crash"", this divide is brought to our screens and shows us a few home truths. Made with an excellent cast and with a wonderful script, the film reminds us that in the majority of life's decisions, racism is there. Whether intentional or subconscious, so much of what we do is driven by a dislike for someone of a different skin. This is the disturbing truth of this film and when you have finished feeling unclean and guilty, you realise that despite it's message, the film is a beautiful piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Over the period of one day, the lives of a number of Los Angeles inhabitants are intertwined. The racist cop (Matt Dillon), the robbed District Attourney (Brendan Fraser), the detective with family issues (Don Cheadle), and many others, all these individuals find their lives coming together in one big racist mess.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot, ""Crash"" is an amazing piece of work. Well written and directed by Paul Haggis, it absorbs from the opening moments and leaves you thinking about it's message long after it's closing credits.<br/><br/>The cast also do an exquisite job. Matt Dillon as the racist cop who seems to almost have racism built into his nature without any real reasoning, Don Cheadle as the detective who has to look after his mum, all are brilliant. The award for finest performance though has to go to Sandra Bullock's magnificent turn as the rich, recently robbed wife of the district attorney. Played as a bitch with no real friends who fears rather than hates particular groups, she assumes a constant misconception that all black and Mexican Americans are out to rob people.<br/><br/>One point also worthy of mention is the magnificent conversation between the characters of Anthony and Peter (Ludacris and Larenz Tate). Analysing life in a conversation reminiscent of Tarantino, the two discuss the evolution and position of the black man in society. Beautifully shot, this scene then springs as ironic when the two conform to the stereotypes by robbing Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Crash"", if you can call it a problem, is simply that it forces us to look inside ourselves and examine our own takes on racism. It's a topic which needs self examination, but more often than not, people won't like what they see.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, as a piece of cinema, ""Crash"" is brilliant. Superbly written, shot and acted, it is a joy to watch. A strain, but a joy none the less. For home truths, you need to watch this film."

Crash is, at the core, all about racism, stereotypes, the human condition and redemption. It's an art film there is no doubt about it but with a clear and concise and often scary message.<br/><br/>The plot is very multi-storied. You have several different stories, occasionally overlapping about different people in different circumstances of different races. They all have different reasons for the feelings that they share about life and about these other races. White, Black, Chinese, East Indian, Mexican, many different races are presented in the film and I don't believe (despite what anyone says on here) that any one race is presented in any different of a light. I believe Paul Haggis who directed and wrote the film did an amazing job of portraying all these people and races in the same sort of distinction which is a seemingly impossible job. He walks such an incredibly thin line that could have turned this film into an insult to so many but he perfects it!! Let's talk about this cast...a run down of the stars...Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Ludicrous, Shaun Toub, Loretta Devine, Tony Danza, Bahar Soomekh and so many more. The brilliant thing about this cast is that they reflect what the film is about. This is a racial mix of Hollywood stars. They all represent a different portion of humanity. To talk about any one of their performances would be pointless. They all share nearly the same amount of screen time as there is so much going on in the film. They all do an incredible job. <br/><br/>Watching their stories is just as interesting as real life and just as scary. They all have their reasons for their particular bigotry and for some of them they find redemption and for others they never do. Crash was not made for entertainment but for a message, a sad, harsh, well meant message about humanity and racial equality and living together. And how sad and lonely we all are to the point where we would crash into another human being just have contact. Check this one out for something different and important in film making!!"

","At first, i thought maybe this movie is as the previous Crash.. but nothing alike. Go see this movie. It's a masterpiece. It has many stories, that all eventually get together, while some may think its a bit kitschy, for my opinion, it's perfect. This movie came to say something, and it did it flawlessly. 11 out of 10<br/><br/>***contain spoilers***<br/><br/>I especially liked the scenes where the racial cop saves the black woman , and where his partner risking his life without knowing to save her husband from going ballistic, after they both made the above two situations. While after, the same second cop is killing from misunderstanding & pressure, another man."

","A snapshot of anger and intolerance in modern-day LA, Crash follows a group of apparently disparate characters whose lives intertwine over 24 traumatic hours. It's an impressive directorial debut from Million Dollar Baby scribe Paul Haggis. But as intelligent, provocative and marvellously acted as it undoubtedly is, Crash still relies on a string of clichés, contrivances and coincidences to hammer its message home.<br/><br/>That message is: rich or poor, law-enforcing or law-breaking, hard-working or work-shirking  one way or another, everyone's a racist... but we all have a shot at redemption.<br/><br/>With Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton and Don Cheadle in the mix, this was always going to be worth a look. And being a film about preconceptions, the film benefits from some interesting casting, with Sandra Bullock playing against type as a disaffected wife, Tony Danza as a sly TV producer and 'Ludacris' Bridges as a car-jacker with a chip on his shoulder about everything - including rap music. But even here, Haggis sometimes takes the obvious route by giving the most unsavoury-looking guy - Michael Pena's Latino locksmith  the purest disposition.<br/><br/>Plot-wise and thematically, Crash veers from the predictable to the inspired. But while it also takes too much time to tie up its many strands, it is as thoughtfully made and thought-provoking an ensemble drama as you're likely to see this decade."

","First of all, let me say that I liked the movie. A lot. I think that it was a great character study which also touched home on interesting issues such as family, race, the American so-called melting pot and relationships. The best theme of the movie I believe was showing that sometimes bad people do great deeds, and good people do horrible ones. However, the similarities with Magnolia were so obvious. If they hadn't been I'd rate it a 10. PT Anderson must be angry somewhere. The many characters all coming together as their stories are revealed bit by bit, the horrible deeds done by thw ""wholesome"" characters (Ryan Phillipes cover-up in crash and The gameshow hosts molesting of his daughter in Maghnolia). The redemption of the sinners - Ludicrous in crash and Tom Cruise & William H Macy in Magnolia.

","The summary should do, really. But let's elaborate a little. Before I say anything else, I'll tell you I'm a critical movie watcher. I'm European, prefer European movies as they have far more depth and diversity and I have little respect for the rubbish shoveled out of Hollywood. But I still keep an eye on it. Even among the trash you can find things worth keeping, and this movie definitely qualifies.<br/><br/>The story is sobering, at least at first. It doesn't hold it's punches when the human condition (at least in L.A.) is described, and it shows us racism is rampant everywhere. Yes, even in the USA. The quality of this movie lies is the complexity of the emotion that is shown - events and characters are not black and white, if you pardon the pun. Characters are far more rounded that we are used to seeing in Hollywood movies. Still, Crash doesn't manage to keep it's strong points going for the entire duration of the movie. Sentimentalism creeps in, some events you can see from a mile away and the obligatory 'happy' ending cannot be avoided (I don't think you'd consider it a spoiler if I tell you most characters in the movie have received a lesson in life by the end). But what we see in between opening and closing credits is strong enough to make not want to dwell on that too much - it's also strong enough for me not to be naive and think the lessons learned will stick, not with most of them anyway.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a rare thing to see a movie of this quality, with this cast, come out of the Hollywood studio's. You wouldn't want to miss that, would you?"

The characters are good chosen, almost each nationality living in Los Angeles is represented. It shows us how our prejudices are affecting us in our lives and doings, and how we judge our fellow men with our stereotyped ideas. The characters in the film confront their own prejudices and show us that inside of all of us lays a good one and a bad one, that we ""learn"" our prejudices and that there is always a possibility to change our way of thinking and our lives.

I read somewhere that Oprah said if you only see one movie this year, make sure it's this one so I went tonight with a friend and we both agreed that it was absolutely and stunningly close to perfection. It's a movie about how the lives of a several different strangers intersect through a series of events over a couple of days in Los Angeles. It's about how we are all racists (or at the very least strongly judgmental of others) in some way or another and yet what makes us all the same is our humanity and how a split second can change your life forever. The tag line for it is ""live your life at the point of impact"" and I'm telling you when you watch this movie you'll feel like you've been severely impacted afterward. It drove me through every emotion imaginable and those emotions manifested themselves physically in my body while I was watching it. As we were leaving the theater, awestruck, I had tingles on the top of my head. I can't remember the last time, if ever, I've seen a movie that moved me in such a profound way.

Not only do we have a presentation of American society in the microcosm that is LA, but there is no one character that you are told to see as the bad guy by the end. Prejudice and racism runs in the very fabric of everything Americana, and we see how it manifests as hatred cycles over and over. Misunderstandings, miscommunications and misinterpretations contribute to the downward spiral in the story of this film, all three points very much prevalent in our society.<br/><br/>The level of acting is good enough that you don't need focus in on it...which is great.

The level of tension and the bread-down of trust was omnipresent. Black is not white, there seemed to be few shades of gray. The land of the free is the land of insecurity and fear combined with an incredible superiority complex. What can happen to a society like this ? I think it was brave tackle this subject through several inter-related vignettes. I did not leave the cinema smiling...and I was thinking about what I had experienced in LA through he eyes of Canadian director Paul Higgis.

I never would've guessed her as one but she is great. It's like she bitches out everyone in the entire film and there are a few scenes with her that she is great in. Ludicrous, who we know as the rapper, who sings Move bitch get out the way, is great. Move bitch get out the way. who'd of thought that that would be a good performance? Everyone in Crash gives great performances. There are characters that you hate, feel sorry for, and that will drive you crazy. The situations involved in Crash are all emotional and fantastic. Crash also features characters that are assholes and turn to good people and people who are good people and are turned into bad people. Matt Dillon gives a great performance as a racist cop who redeems himself towards the end. i'm not going to go too much into the characters and stuff. There are so many situations that I don't want to go into to because they are so good. Crash was the best film of 2005, and it also won best picture at the Oscar's. I think it's truly a masterpiece.

"mxbishop","9","1","7","21 July 2008"," Great Drama
","I'm surprised at all the negative comments about this film. For me, _Crash_ succeeded in supplying great drama, writing, acting, and direction. Others have compared _Crash_ to _Magnolia_ - but for me, _Magnolia_ is stale, ponderous, and far too long. _Crash_ moves along very briskly - and does not linger on any one character to the point of banality.<br/><br/>I think what made the movie work for me was the idea that no one is beyond redemption - but even so, redemption is not always guaranteed. Matt Dillon first appears as a completely despicable character, and later - in what I found to be an amazing scene, he rescues a woman whom he had earlier molested. Meanwhile Ryan Phillippe, who at first seems to possess a true sense of justice, and later helps Terrence Howard out of a real jam with cops that want to shoot him, has a moment of poor judgment, and suffers a terrible psychological price for it.<br/><br/>I also think the music is great (Mark Isham) - and really sets the mood for the drama that unfolds. As humans, I think we can and should treat each other better. That's all this movie is really trying to say.<br/><br/>The only fault with this film that I can find is the tacked on ""Hollywood"" ending of showing another car crash - and the resulting altercation that ensues, as the camera dutifully pans upward. To me, that's how you end a comedy - not a drama, and especially not a drama as good as _Crash_."
"nishant-cool07","9","1","7","1 July 2008"," This one has to be watched for its sensitivity
","This one is more than worth the bucks stuff from Paul Haggis.I like the idea of exploring the subjects not everyone likes to talk about , but they still very much touch and sometimes haunt our lives in some way or the other.We all have judge mental shortcuts and almost all of us suffer from the biases that creep into the thought process of an individual as a part of his/her upbringing or the cultural legacy that he/she inherits.We have some preconceived notions about people from a particular race or geography and all of that is not friendly most of the times.But they do exist and subjects like this specially if it has racist overtones, are like elephant in the room.Nobody wants to talk about it.<br/><br/>Then you get to see a movie wherein there are heterogeneous characters who just stumble upon each other and then there is a clash between different worlds.The script does really well to develop the characters along with the plot and there are phases in the story telling where all the characters are going through the same phases of emotional turbulence and their believes are being questioned by none other than themselves.The way the characters grow in the movie is also very well in sync with the context and their coming to terms with the reality of existence of people different from their notions.This actually sets the pace for the movie.<br/><br/>There are some really moving performances from all of the actors specially by Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon.Sandra Bullock and Branden Fraser are also impressive with their depiction of a couple who are as much confused and perturbed as the rest of the lot.The background score just intensifies the emotions and you would almost feel for the man crying on the screen.<br/><br/>All the characters in the movie live in pairs and all the time they are talking about their own experiences and mindset about the rest of the world with conviction.Whether thats correct or not is never judged by the director himself, which highlights the fact that there are not inherently good or bad people, its just that there are different people and we by our insight and judgment decide which of these two categories do they fit in.The judgment itself can be erratic at times or the circumstances forcing may not be friendly.<br/><br/>But end of the day , the movie sort of agrees to the existence of different worlds within the limits of a city and the characters also have no choice but to grow up and come to terms with it.Unlike Babel whether everything is left to the viewer's discretion , this one tells you the story of a city and its people with the sensitivity of appreciating a goodwill gesture and feeling for somebody's loss.<br/><br/>Make sure you watch this one !!!"
"johnnyboyz","8","1","7","29 February 2008"," Haggis produces something that makes us aware; that tells us to open our eyes. Intriguing and often quite powerful.
","Until very recently, this film held a high spot on my own personal top 50 films; that is until I re-watched it and it fell a few dozen places. But let that not fool you, for Crash is still a well made and in depth look at life, race, racism in society and that element of fate that binds us all; wherever we live. When you deal with films that tackle race and racism, it's always good to make your first port of call information on the writer. From what we know, Paul Haggis is a white Canadian and yet he includes characters in his film who are of the Asian, African-American and Hispanic decent. I would not say he does all of them justice but one theme that lies within Crash is, in fact, stereotyping and how we perceive someone of another race on first glance.<br/><br/>I think when I saw this at the cinema two years ago; I came out thinking I'd seen something that was brilliant. Two years of maturity towards other races and having met many more people, some of which are not of my own white, Caucasian; the film does not seem as spell-binding and amazing as I first thought although the scene in which one character's little girl 'saves' him form a bullet still pulled at the emotional strings; a little harder this time around for some reason  maybe because I watched it alone this time, who knows. But anyway, Crash remains a smart and somewhat deep film. The idea at its core is 'how do we see people around us of different descent?' A very early scene has Anthony (Ludacris) comment, out loud, on his distaste for Jean Cabot (Bullock) as she displays defensive body language upon seeing two black people walking down the road together. It is all about first impressions and how we perceive other people. The twist or the sting in the tail is, of course, that what follows is a carjacking of said persons.<br/><br/>But Haggis does not make the error of making a point and then counteracting it. Later on, a Persian (not Arab, they want you to know) shopkeeper gets extremely hostile toward Daniel (Peña), a Mexican locksmith, but only does so through his own lack of ability to speak the language native to the country he is a citizen of (English in America). Similarly; when Jean and her husband Rick (Fraser) get home from the carjacking, Jean has similar antagonistic feelings toward Daniel because she has just suffered at the hand of rejecting her instincts for another ethnic group: she isn't going to make the same mistake and goes with her hunch by insulting Daniel who she believes will pass on their keys to his burglar 'amigos' after changing the locks. We find out a scene later than Daniel is a loving and caring father with a wife and kid; one of whom it would seem has suspended his own dreams in order to move out of a rough neighbourhood after a stray bullet crashed through his daughter's bedroom. This perception Jean has is wrong; she was correct in thinking Anthony and his buddy were hostile but grossly incorrect in Daniel - this is the theme; perception.<br/><br/>Crash is set over the Christmas period; a time of year difficult for most people given the reunion with families (some of which people will not like) and everything is very busy and highly strung. This creates the perfect backdrop for Crash and its issues. Likewise, staying with the initial perception theme; police officer John Ryan (Dillon) is a racist and a bigot when he is faced with extreme situations or times of testosterone rush: the phone conversation with Shaniqua and the frisking of the other black woman are examples of this; I mention this because our usual perception of white cops may be that they are law abiding and upstanding  something Ryan's partner Tom Hansen (Phillippe) certainly embodies although the denouement in his life occurs when the obnoxious, hitchhiking African American he is giving a lift to later on acts suspiciously when he reaches into his pocket; what follows is nothing short of typical, for a number of reasons that would spoil the film if I went into them.<br/><br/>I think an important scene in the film that embodies the films themes is the one in the TV studio; the director comes down from the gallery and states that a character didn't say the line 'black' enough. Such a situation highlights, once again, the difficultness we have of coming to terms with stereotypes and what's what. If the African American did not say the line like he did then maybe that's not how he speaks after all; likewise, who wrote the script within the script? A white man? A black man? We'll never know, and we'll never know if he imagined black people to talk like that. Needless to say, the director that comes down is white and he says it to a black floor director. Crash itself may have be written by a white Canadian but it does show at points; the Korean characters of Mr and Mrs. Ho aren't well written and there are some needless arguments spawned by race; a black character and someone Hispanic argue over what should have been said over a phone call and it seems all a bit silly but there you go. In the end, no one has really 'won'. Detective Waters has found his brother; John Ryan's father is still very sick; the Cambodians that are found are let loose into the streets of hate and racism without any aid at all and people still shunt one another in their cars. It may not be a pretty film but it's often powerful, often interesting and makes you think about those of different race around you."

"Isaac5855","9","1","7","20 April 2007"," An Extraorindary Motion Picture Experience
","CRASH was a breathtaking and undeniably powerful motion picture that moved some, angered others, and has probably caused more impassioned debate than any film of the last 10 years. This Oscar winner for Best Picture is an unsettling, imaginative, and quietly accurate examination at the very touchy subject of race relations and how, in some very subtle ways, we really haven't made much progress in this area since the 1960's. This film rattled cages everywhere because it shined a light on behaviors in this country that we want to believe don't exist but have really just been quietly shoved in the closet and almost out of sight. This film angered a lot of people because it's unflattering to us and shows a side of us that we would rather believe doesn't exist but I defy anyone who sees this extraordinary film not to find one character or event that they can relate to, have seen something similar occur, or know someone in their own lives who is like a character in this film. Many have criticized this film for conveying the ugliness of prejudice and bigotry with a sledgehammer but I disagree. Paul Haggis' superb Oscar winning screenplay weaves a tapestry of story and character that never punches you in the face. Instead it haunts your conscious with its powerfully quiet indictment of our own inner demons that we had forgotten about. This film traces 24 hours in the lives of several disparate characters in downtown Los Angeles where the separate events these people experience shed a different light on this still highly sensitive issue. The cast is uniformly superb...Don Cheadle plays a police detective whose investigation into a dirty cop's death finds him in a position of compromising an investigation through reverse discrimination while dealing with a drug-addicted mother, a hoodlum younger brother and a latino partner/girlfriend (Eva Mendes). Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges does a star-making a turn as an intelligent LA thug who loves to blast white Los Angeles for the deplorable way they treat black people while carjacking a political candidate and his wife, played by Brendon Frasier and Sondra Bullock. Bullock is surprisingly effective in a very unsympathetic role. Terrence Howard is brilliant as black TV producer who is humiliated during a traffic stop involving a bigoted cop (Matt Dillon, Best Supporting Actor Nominee)going a little too far with his girlfriend (Thandie Newton)has him questioning his manhood and taking the law into his own hands when Bridges also tries to carjack him, not to mention a reconnection between Dillon and Newton that provides one of the film's most powerful moments. Mention should also be made of Ryan Phillippe as a sympathetic cop who finds out he's not as liberal as he thought and Larenz Tate as Bridges' running partner. And don't miss the ""Magic Cloak"" scene...one of the single most moving scenes in the history of cinema. It's not fun, it's not flattering, and it's not easy to watch, but CRASH is an important and beautifully crafted look at an armpit of our society which we would like to think no longer exists."

","Yes that is what this movie does is states that everyone is Racists. Not a little bit but entirely and completely. Yet that is a harsh comment about us but this movie does provide some hope as we see the characters change. Now whatever you are easily offended, or hate stereotypes, or just hate racism entirely see this movie. Why you ask? Because if you go see a movie that deals with racism and do not want to get offended well that is just stupid because the point of such movies is to get offended seeing a racism movie and not wanting to be offended is like going to a beach in a clown suit, just does not work. And whatever you felt this movie told you things you already knew and hate it for that well show it to people who do not understand such things for this movie is still a must see."
"HiddenVoice","7","1","7","6 September 2006"," A harsh look at people.
","Crash really goes deep to tackle the race issues.A thing that has plagued humanity.A thing that keeps driving men with power to manipulate those who are different and keep them under their foot.Even if it focuses only on a handful of characters,from which only some are actually widely discriminated,its issues are still universal.<br/><br/>As it begins with a murder having taken place,and into the investigation,A character asks himself why we keep colliding with one another,even if we never come close to each other.As the story progresses,it becomes an urban drama with a murder mystery left to be solved.Lives of a group of people with different background comes colliding with each other resulting in consequences,surprises and redemption.In the following 36 hours,their lives will change and they will somewhat question their actions.A Persian store owner and his daughter who have problem with a Mexican locksmith fixing locks.A housewife and her DA husband's continuing quarrels over having mistrust in people who are not white, working for them.Two black carjackers,one who completely despises white people and pervasively accuses white people for everything.A black TV director who is accused by his wife of being a wimp and a coward towards a cop sexually and racially harassing both of them.A police detective investigating a crime and having problems with his partner who also is his lover and his personal life.A rookie cop who is put along with an experienced officer working for 13 years,who also have trouble taking care of his father, to learn from,who harasses non-white people.These men and women will learn why they are so intolerant to each other and find redemption within one another.<br/><br/>Upon my first viewing,I was left sorely disappointed.You see,I really show deep respect to films that tackle racial discrimination with sensitivity.With Paul Haggis writing and making his debut,that further got me interested.But it wasn't what I expected.It does delves into those issues,but somehow it feels an unfocused attempt.Yes,it doesn't approach its racial issues in a straightforward manner.It rather includes a murder mystery into the whole story,but that's where the problem begins.It can't decide which does it want to be.An urban,mystery crime drama or a race drama.And it gets all jumbled and convoluted.And its direct speeches from the characters makes it look cheap,as any young filmmaker can pull that cheap trick off.It somehow steps into the obvious.As it takes a non-conventional take to its subject,it slowly enters to that obviousness.I would expect something more unconventional from Haggis.Despite its honest attempt and sensitively handled subject,it somehow lacks something.Something effective is missing.It somehow doesn't know how to end the whole film.It can't make up its mind.It remains ambiguous.It sometimes appears too preachy and corny and weak.The stories are uneven.And sometimes there are way too many coincidences.<br/><br/>But having said that,I still regard this among the most thoughtful and important films in the Cinema world.One that every person must see.Its uncomfortable and hard look on race relations makes it impossible for you to look away.You are forced to view what we have become from what we once were.Where man once was of the same color/race,of the same species,and living on one continent and land,before separating into various continents and various colors and races,has now become so different from their own kind that we start questioning ourselves.What is going on?What's wrong with us?Why do we hate each other so much?Why does color or our background makes such a difference.Why all this hatred?Misunderstanding each other due to our different languages,given us by the ones who created us in this confusing world,is another thing.But misunderstanding each other even when we are able to understand each other,because we are different is something else.<br/><br/>Like all films that tackle with really thought provoking issues,this film also leaves us with no answer,but just forces us to look at our ever-changing world from a distance and see what's happening.It ends with a notion that if we try to tolerate one another,if we just try hard enough,there might be a possibility that we may coexist even if we remain treating each other the way we have been,there might just be some hope.This film is not entirely or not even remotely successful to what it was trying to convey.But it comes close to stimulate our receptors to send signals to our head to come to our senses.But giving this film the best picture award over BrokeBack Mountain,I think that was unjustified.<br/><br/>The film boosts fantastic score,and a melodious and beautifully written original track,IN THE DEEP.Impressive cinematography.<br/><br/>The films main strength is in its ensemble performances.Every actor gives full justice to his/her character.In particular,Thandie Newton and Terrance Howard.Matt Dillon is really convincing as an enraged,anger filled cop.His nomination was well deserving.But I was surprised how Thandie Newton didn't get her nomination,when she gave a really deep performance.Howard was already great in Hustle and Flow,but here he shows his versatility.Ludicrous is really amusing and really makes you laugh at his character whenever he starts accusing white people.And Michael Pena also really shines.The entire cast does a fantastic job.You simply can't look at a single performance to sum it up.It's an ensemble piece and the credit should go to each and every actor.The reflective emotional moments are really well executed.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis' first feature is a superb debut.He handles everything really well.His script is a strong point.The flaws in the script are clearly visible but the performances hides them well.But Haggis' screenplay should be given credit for approaching the subject in a different way.A well done effort.<br/><br/>So,Crash may be another undeserving Best Picture like Chicago.But it certainly needs to be watched.<br/><br/>7.5__B+__***1/2"

Their were good guys and bad guys, and you could see everything from their prospective. It didn't rely on gore as most Quentin Tarantino films. Even Sandra Bullock's acting was perfect for this film and perhaps it is because she was playing a character much closer to herself. I have found her performances in other films with those cute romantic films to be phony and forced. Her interviews come off as being very careful and guarded. The move grabs your attention from the start, even though the opening credits and credits music make you think this is going to be an odd film."

","The great thing about this movies is it's a thinker. Now I realize thats almost cheapening to a movie like this, but it does make you sit back and look at the general rationalizations we make against other races. Now some have bashed the dialog and the acting, both of which I found excellent in their nature. I'm not the best myself but I do enjoy writing and delving into someone else's art/writing. The best thing about this movie has to be the fact that most of the lines are the to the harshest extent, but they basically say what a lot of us say in our heads. Things that we know isn't ""PC"" and we save it in our memory and tell our own race a joke about it. This whole movie is a dive into the interactions of all races, it doesn't just take punches at Caucasians and blacks, or even just Hispanics. It knocks on everyones door and says ""Hi I'm a racist!"" And we all are to some degree, wait till you tell that joke about that one race that time they did that one thing. Then you'll realize it. I've seen and heard all of the things written in this movie, so realism isn't a problem. But luckily I've been on most every aspect of our social ladder, and seen others there. I've lived on the west side, the north side, the ghetto, the trailer park, the lake house, been there done that. And people are just like this, yet most of us are quiet about it. Just take sometime to watch it, think about it, and realize we all have flaws, and our acceptance of each other makes us a stronger community and country."

It just makes your eyes well up with tears and makes you so proud to be human, despite all your failings. It has such moments of truth, such moments of passion, such moments of humor! In fact, I would describe the movie exactly as that, a collection of moments - a collage. The theme of redemption is especially prominent in the movie. Characters gain greater insight into themselves and a more profound sense of humanity through their metaphorical collisions. Hands down the best movie I have ever seen!

You can trust me when I say a movie is good because it truly is. This movie isn't good, it's excellent. It is the most emotional and controversial film I have ever seen. The acting is superb, even from Ludicrous who was great. I was most impressed with the acting of Matt Dillon and Thawndie Newton. Newton and Dillon both gave the performances of their lives as a racist troubled cop and a disturbed angry wife. I am however very upset that Paul Haggis, the best screen writer today did not win best director.

","It is very hard to weave stories with the mastery that this movie has; often we marvel about coincidences in our lives, but this are more common that we suppose. Our lack of omnipresence makes the repercussion of our actions, silent and blind. Crash exposes one of this circles of life, masterfully deploying the hidden or held thoughts and words that we so call racism, human nature, anger and love, hope and despair, magic and science. Can we erase the word racism from the dictionary? Can we erase it from our lives, our world and our actions? I have yet to know of a society where some type of racism doesn't take place. Every time something new appears there is a new reason to practice racism, bigotry or hate. If it is not AIDS, it is poverty, or skin pigment, or smell, or customs.It seems as if human nature was inherently pushing us towards hate. Now and then, there is something that makes things come into perspective. If it is a profet, a book, a singer or in this case a movie. Enjoy."

The sound track song beautifully by Bird York was excessively useful in capturing feelings of all nature; from sorrow to shame.<br/><br/>I have been very emphatic on the fact that i do not usually take a huge liking to many movies. perhaps this is due to me watching such a vast quantity of movies.

From the beginning you're thrust into multiple situations all having to do with racism over a wide spectrum of people in Los Angeles. Every person, knowing or not, is connected to everyone in the movie in some way shape or form. The only complaints I would have to have would be the vulgarity. The only problem would have to be the language. This is not for the relatively innocent viewer. It's very crass and very realistic.

","Story about two days in the life of various characters in LA. There's a rich couple (Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser) who have their car stolen by two black men. There's Don Cheadle playing a police detective with partner Jennifer Esposito--he has a junkie mother and a criminal brother. Matt Dillon plays a VERY racist cop with horrified partner Ryan Phillippe. Loretta Devine plays a black health insurance worker who has to deal with Dillon. A middle Eastern couple has their store looted by a gang who think they're Arabs. Terence Howard plays a man whose wife is sexually (sort of) assaulted by Dillon--who did it because he's black. There's also a Latino repairman mixed in this. These stories all start up apart and slowly converge together by the end.<br/><br/>The movie is strong--the dialogue pulls no punches and ethic slurs are commonly used BUT it is necessary for the the integrity of the story. The movie is (of course) anti-racist and anti-gun--the NRA must HATE this movie. With the sole exception of Fraser the cast is great. Everybody explodes--especially Bullock (in a GREAT scene), Dillon, Phillippe and Howard. I only give this a 9 because, towards the end, the plotting becomes clumsy and there are way too many unlikely situations. Still worth catching.<br/><br/>Now--as for the Oscar controversy saying that this stole the Oscar from ""Brokeback Mountain"". Not really. (For the record, I'm a gay man). ""Brokeback"" was long, slow, boring and depressing. Also some Academy members said (AFTER the awards) that they hadn't seen ""Brokeback"" and had no intention of watching a gay love story. Also ""Crash"" was simply a better movie. Still I don't think it deserved an Academy Award for Best Picture--it's not THAT good. But it didn't steal it from ""Brokeback""."
"sbonzai","10","1","7","29 March 2006"," Watch it with someone you love
","'Crash' is a movie that really touched me. As a young man, rarely does one reminded of the importance of life, love, family and friends as in this movie. Moreover, after watching, the viewer is left with the need to hug his loved ones as hard as he can. This is the type of movies you watch with a loved one.<br/><br/>The movie mainly deals with relationships between people of different ethnicities in America. Being a Jewish Israeli citizen, the political situation seems so obvious, that any debate is dismissed as being chewed up and redundant. Yet, this movie shook me up. The same issues we are confronted with on a daily basis, in different scenery and with different participants, seem so much clearer. While everything is divided to black and white in this movie (and other ethnic groups), the division miraculously disappears in the hands of the director. Suddenly there are only people, driven by the same fears and desires, but separated by different environments and statuses, and brain washed by different lies. In fact, here lies the beauty of 'Crash'. It doesn't try to disprove stereotypes. By it's standards, stereotypes are not the problem of this world, they are just a slight exaggeration of the harsh reality. The problem is the people who give in to those stereotypes, and by that contribute to the conflicts they are living in.<br/><br/>Another issues dealt by 'Crash' are, car accidents (as suggested by the title) and children's care of elderly parents. I won't elaborate, but if you wanted to take one thing from this movie, it would bee this: You can improve every aspect of your life. All you have to do is pay attention to people, to your loved ones, to the elderly. Show them respect, and people will respect you. Give them your love, and they will love you. Protect them, and you could not be harmed. Mistreat people, and the reality you live in will never change. <br/><br/>(And that's by the way how the movie explains also car accidents, in the first line)<br/><br/>The truth is that the only problem I have with 'Crash' is it's title, which has little to do with it's content. That way, It could easily be mistaken for some kind of high budget action film. But, I guess, I can understand the motives behind such a name. $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$<br/><br/>This Review is devoted with great love to my best friend, who is like a brother to me.

"marjel0412","9","1","7","28 March 2006"," This movie HAS a POINT
","No man is completely good or bad. Though, one can generally incline to one of those sides. <br/><br/>Sometimes our reactions to situations (are provoked) depend on our previous/recent experiences (maybe too recent). Every man is capable of doing noble as bad things, though it's not a 50% - 50% thing (thank God). We should try, as much as we can, to open some kind of ""umbrella"" (take precautions) when we see that some kind of a ""storm"" is coming our way. If we are just careful enough we should be able to notice (most of the times) same changes (""clouds coming"") and trigger our ""security alarm"". For most of the cases that is: run like hell from everybody else until the ""storm"" passes... eventually, the shiny sun is above the clouds and always comes after the rain  and that's a very comforting certainty. In this case we see the same people with different ""weather conditions"" inside them - reacting differently to various situations. <br/><br/>We see that when our ""sky"" is blue and shiny just before the certain situation => we are capable to see things more clearly, altruistically and are (beautifully) capable of doing the great and noble deeds, even ready to give our very own life for someone else. But, if/when the ""storm"" comes, our judgment is temporarily clouded, and we are not capable to see thing clearly => we have little time, less ""light"" of reason and compassion, and so, we make quick/wrong/stupid decisions (most of the time). So, we might have many (good inclining) people in prison just for being a bad ""weather forecaster"" => doing wrong things during their personal internal ""storms"". (I hope I'm using good expression; English's not my native tang)<br/><br/>So, generally good people: (or those inclining to good; those who listen to their conscience) might do foolish things in their ""storm"" moments (but these are only moments, when they pass  they're generally very sorry for what they did - and they'll try to make things better), on the other hand  bad people (or those inclining...): are also CAPABLE of doing noble things if something happens that helps them to see their ""light"", their ""sunny sky"" full of reason, love, compassion and peace. And they'll do it completely naturally.<br/><br/>And now we come to the very POINT of this movie:<br/><br/>Do not judge your fellowman at first sight, maybe (s)he had a bad moment/minute/hour /day/month/year/life, maybe (s)he just didn't have the opportunity to see his/hers blue sky lately (or ever). Maybe (s)he needs just a little understanding or a KIND word. Maybe that's just a moment that'll pass soon and (s)he'll be his/her old self again (= hopefully good). One wise man said: ""One good word can make a bad man (turn) good, and one bad word can make a good one (turn) bad."" We should try not to have any prejudices, paradigms... every man is a unique gift to human race... and also: essentially there are no races... and sadly: there are those who are willfully determined to be bad.<br/><br/>Do not lose your faith in people's goodness, believe in them, give them more space, everyone can change, everyone can be good (or bad, unfortunately), just let us give everybody that chance  we might be surprised."

As for the fact that this movie deals with racial subject,I forgot it the instant i heard the opening lines by Don Cheadle and I found the movie to be a fascinating story about people and their insecurities and how their different backgrounds just provide a let out for their feelings,and no matter how trivial different backgrounds of people may appear in the big picture,it does indeed play a big part in our opinions about people. As for some of the people's opinion like the movie is overdone and the dialogs are cheesy,and it is improbable that the so many characters can meet in a big city,I am sure they are missing the whole point of the movie.As far as i am concerned i reveled in the smart dialogs,witty writing and some brilliant acting(yeah,even Sandra bullock does well).This movie made me think which to quote Mr.Haggis himself ,is the whole point of watching a movie.Of course if it was mere entertainment there's always John Woo genre of movies(not that I don't like them).

I will end my comment with some lyrics from the soundtrack (last song) ""You thought you have all the answers / something happened see it coming / You can't stop it ... "" What happened? People are RE-discovering themselves: learn how to see beyond the appearances, learn to respect, they learn to act like human beings again, because there is a human being beyond every black, white or yellow ""cover"".

"Gambitt","8","1","7","1 March 2006"," An insightful and honest commentary about the current state of racism in America
","I thoroughly enjoyed Crash because its perspective on life closely parallels my own.<br/><br/>We bounce around like pinballs, colliding with one another and very frequently doling out injustice to each another. Every now and then through bizarre coincidence, we have the fortune, or misfortune, of colliding with someone from a previous encounter. There are several ways to handle this. If the other person was someone you previously wronged, then you can either flee and avoid further confrontation, or you can try to make amends. If the other person previously injured you, you may try to turn your cheek and forgive, but it's all the more tempting to seek retribution which results in harm greater than what you had suffered; thus conflicts escalate and negative energy builds like a snowball rolling down a hill growing into an avalanche towards some hapless victim at the bottom.<br/><br/>However, most likely you'll hardly ever strike the same person twice in a large city. Instead each encounter will be fresh to you. But each pinball carries with it the weight of prior negative, and positive, collisions. A person in a foul mood from an earlier rude encounter or bitter at being wronged by a person of another race or culture, may lash out at you instead. And hence the cycle continues.<br/><br/>This is further exacerbated by the prevalence of cars in our society. Hiding behind ""metal and glass,"" we can drive rudely, cut off others, run people off the road, with the safety of anonymity and instant escape (ironically, this specific point was not explored in depth in the movie).<br/><br/>Crash reminds us that the world we live in may be smaller than we think. Maybe you did nothing to incur the irrational wrath of a stranger, but what if someone you know did? You may escape the consequences of an injury you inflict on a stranger, but what if that angry person proceeds to injure someone you know? Does it matter at all how far removed you are from the ultimate result? Crash also reminds us how easy it is to succumb to anger, bitterness, and abuse of power. People are frail, vulnerable and imperfect, but with conscious and vigilant fortitude, they can overcome the negative tendencies of human nature. Crash reminds us that though it's not easy, you can attempt to mitigate and relieve the suffering, injustice, and pent-up bitterness with patience, courage, and understanding.<br/><br/>Crash is a must-see movie for everyone."

","This is outstanding. If you're feeling disillusioned with the state of movies or you'd like to see some social commentary without being preached at, then watch this immediately. It is everything that a movie should be.<br/><br/>It's a strange film to categorise, in the same way that Magnolia is. It kinds of stands outside of the standard stuff and just exists as a brilliant piece of cinema. There isn't really a role or a central storyline - just a succession of people, real people, living through a few days in LA. Their lives intertwine, in much the same way that they handled things in Magnolia, but that's not the important bit; it's just important that you sit back with an open mind and observe.<br/><br/>It's very rare that you find a movie that is - essentially - about race that doesn't try to preach at you one way or the other. Racism is a very cloudy issue these days and Crash does not say 'Look at this evil racist' or 'Look at how badly these people are treated', it shows a succession of people being real, genuine people right in the middle of this very tricky subject and lets you draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>There are some fantastic acting performances in this. Terrence Howard and Matt Dillon in particular are superb, most notably the former. He was nominated this year for an Academy Award for his role in Hustle and Flow - which he was also brilliant in - but for me he should have been nominated for best supporting actor for his part in this too. He owns the screen when he's on it.<br/><br/>In short - this is a magnificent movie. It richly deserved it's Academy Award for best picture - I've seen all other nominees and this stood head and shoulders above all of them.

Following the template of Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Crash's"" story is told over the course of 36 hours through the eyes of nearly fifteen people. All of these people are inter-connected with each other, directly or indirectly through their actions.<br/><br/>Beginning at a murder scene, ""Crash"" introduces you to detective/lovers Graham and Ria as they probe the crime scene where he discovers that Graham's younger brother was murdered. Following the template similar to ""Pulp Fiction,"" we are left waiting to find out who did it and why he was killed.<br/><br/>""Crash"" conveys a simple message that's easy to put in words, but difficult to follow: Equality is myth, let it not elude us forever. This is message is seen, but not followed, in the scene where Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser are carjacked. Right before the carjackers steal the car, their conversation includes many truths about the attitude of people towards African-Americans. Their comments are strong, but applicable to the attitude of people towards ethnic persons.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon's role as a racist cop is challenged when he saves a black woman from a car wreck. However, the night before, he pulls her and her husband over when he's searching her, he searches her inappropriately, but whose word will they believe: a police officer's, or a semi-drunk woman's? But with his change of heart in the car wreck, it is seen when human life is a factor, his racism is pushed to the side and humanity brought upfront. If only this was true in real life. This scenario is unlikely in real life, but makes for an eventful change of heart for the film, for which is fits perfectly.<br/><br/>These events, along with many others, make up Paul Haggis' ""Crash."" What can debatedly be called the Best Film of 2005 received six Oscar nomination (every nomination deserved) including Best Supporting Actor (Matt Dillon), Best Editing, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Song (""In the Deep""), Best Director, and Best Picture. However, Terrance Howard deserved a nomination for ""Crash"" in addition to his nomination for ""Hustle and Flow."""
"SandeepLoyalka","9","1","7","2 February 2006"," A Must-Watch!
","Pent-up frustrations,simmering racial tensions...and redemption.That,in essence,is Paul Haggis' brilliant 'Crash'.A layered,richly textured screenplay,outstanding performances from the incredibly talented ensemble cast and impeccable direction make 'Crash' one of the finest films of the year.Several completely absorbing stories run parallel with each other,moving along towards a conclusion filled with hope,despair and a deeper understanding of oneself.This is certainly not escapist fare.Its a film that makes you think and think hard.Its a film that questions our day-to-day urges and motivations.Its a film that simultaneously makes you want to applaud and deplore the human spirit.Haggis sets himself up as a writer-director to reckon with and I would certainly be disappointed if his efforts are ignored during the coming awards season.A must-watch!"

","I live in a remote little town called Ojai, CA. I saw Crash when it first came out. Then I rented it again recently and got much more out of it. PLEASE SEE THE COMMENTARY AT THE END OF THE FILM AS IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE PLOT AND THE REASON THIS FILM WAS MADE. A really interesting thing that's happening is that our church ""Community Church of Ojai"", is having a viewing and discussion time after the movie. This is really progressive for a church, especially a conservative one. This film will be viewed by teens (with parents' permission) and then discussed in detail about what they learned about themselves, etc. and how Jesus wants ALL of us to be but that we are flawed and have to make a ""free will decision"" to make about what they were taught to believe. I believe this film will make a big impact if all of us keep promoting it as such. It should be required viewing for all teens!!! Even it it's rated ""R"". It shows real life situations, not glorified sex and violence. It has a point and a huge message. JUST REMEMBER TO VIEW THE COMMENTARY AT THE END. Thanks for reading this. I pray it will inspire you to spread the word and end racism and hatred for others based on their color or status."

","I have seen hundreds among hundreds of films, but never before has my heart beaten against my chest so hard, nor my hands shaken so nervously as when I was privileged enough to view this film. Never before has film been used so effectively to communicate to an audience, a point that is globally understood, but seldom discussed, and rarely debated due to taboo and political correctness.<br/><br/>Crash addresses such an important part of human society in 21st century. Post 9/11, long since multiculturalism has been accepted into the mesh of our societies, it speaks a thousand languages with one clear message; humans are racially intolerant. It doesn't say 'they are intolerant by default' or 'humans have always been and will always be intolerant', but it attempts to ask why we have gotten this way. We are falling apart, but above all; there is hope. People have the ability to change, and to embrace cultures contrary to their own.<br/><br/>A poetically filmed piece of cinema complemented by a magical soundtrack by Mark Isham, this film should be viewed by everyone and anyone. If you live and breathe in any kind of modern society, this film is relevant to you.<br/><br/>All of the actors in this film perform a solid and well-executed performance. The only gripe I would have is that Brendan Fraser has been miscast in this film. Someone like Denis Quaid or Dylan McDermott would have fit the role much more convincingly in my opinion.<br/><br/>Easily in my top 3."
"joestank15","10","1","7","30 December 2005"," Wow. just wow.
","How could this one've slipped past theaters with such minimal exposure? A series of interconnected vignettes involving diverse characters and odd circumstances. I should've known to pick this one up when I saw that Don Cheadle stars. That man is a magical actor. Other important players are Terrence Howard as a successful black Hollywood director who is unsure about whether to stand and fight for his dignity after he and his wife are pulled over and abused by Matt Dillon, while Ryan Phillips a conflicted cop, is disgusted at Dillon's abuse of power. And this is the best movie Brendan Fraser has done since Gods and Monsters, but we don't see as much of him. His wife Sandra Bullock (who I was delighted to not see play herself) is spooked into distrusting and despising all minorities after she and Fraser are car-jacked. There are like 12 or 13 other important characters, and each is given a thoughtful and diverse background.<br/><br/>Paul Higgis is a masterful director and writer. The film is engaging, intense and powerful, with central themes of race and socio-economic status (more the former than the latter). I dislike using the terms Hero and Villain because these people are just people. Points of view switch and people grow, as they would in real life. The movie is slightly fanciful but not so much that it looses reality. And the fact that it is so real is what makes you connect with it the most.<br/><br/>No question, this is the best movie of the year and gets an A."

","This film is a work of genius from Mr Paul Haggis. Before I went to see this movie, I asked my uncle if he could tell me what it is generally about. He replied, 'It's a film about racism'. My initial thought was here is another movie that is a battle between whites and blacks. But when I went to see it at the movies, I was amazed, gob-smacked. It isn't a racist film between whites and blacks: it depicts a multi-ethnic racism society where in the space of 36 hours (I think) they will collide with one another. You will also notice that at the end of the movie, you do not hate anyone, no matter how racist or not racist they are: you will be able to communicate with all the characters and you see their perspectives on their lives. Absolute work of genius, definitely one of the best movies in 2005."

","Bringing approximately 8 talented actors together is one thing, and to bring together 8 talented actors and make an outstanding movie is on a whole new level. This movie has done just that in my opinion.<br/><br/>'Crash' is a movie that shows reality like it has never been shown before. The acting from all actors, and I mean 'all' actors was fantastic, rather like a perfect match for the roles that were portrayed by them in this movie.<br/><br/>The way different races and societies live in all areas of the world may not interest many, but to think that people tend to have the same problems as one another is something that goes unnoticed, and it is interesting and important as the viewer can relate to many of the situations that are reflected on screen. The movie is powerful, moving, dramatic and important. The acting is exactly right, and the movie is supported by a brilliant soundtrack also. It can be enjoyed by a worldwide audience, and the acting is not stereotypical in any way as some may think, it is the harsh reality that we live in.<br/><br/>It is worth watching, and I would recommend it to anybody who is curious about the society and the world we live in."

","Pulp fiction was entertaining when it came out. There was something fresh about having multiple stories dancing around into one quirky film. Yes it wasn't a novel idea, but it was well made and didn't pretend to be anything other than an entertaining movie. That however can't be said for Crash. It doesn't just try to entertain it is more or less preaching diversity and stereotypes throughout. Watching the film you get the sense that your in A Clockwork Orange and you are being treated for saying something racist... here watch this movie... let us bang you over the head about the evils of being a racist... no.... let us bang it into your head again.<br/><br/>I have to admit that the movie is well done and generally has decent performances but give me a break.

","I just saw this film for the first time and was completely blown away by it. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have witnessed first hand almost every situation depicted there in. I've never seen or heard or read anything that demonstrates more clearly the difficulties of Los Angelean living. It is a profoundly diverse melting pot completed segregated by it's geography, religious and racial differences and as Don Cheadle's character points out; steel and glass. The performances are just about flawless particularly Matt Dillon, Michael Peña, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Sandra Bullock and begrudgingly I have to give props to Ryan Phillipie who usually I prefer to make fun of.<br/><br/>Director Paul Haggis weaves the lives of some 25 different characters through two tumultuous days in L.A. As each life comes into contact with the next we watch as so many of their actions are fueled by their fear and ignorance of each other. At the same time we see how similar each character truly is regardless of race, religion, creed or color. Fear and ignorance, fear and ignorance, if only we could see how truly similar we all are. It's an emotionally charged and deeply moving depiction of a city and people that I love and highly recommend it to anyone interested in good thought provoking enthralling movie making.<br/><br/>DjM"

Reminds me of Pulp Fiction in many ways (can't tell you why without divulging the plot). <br/><br/>Sandra Bullock made me laugh. She so appropriately portrayed her character and the prejudice that's innate after you live in L.A. for a while. Larenz Tate's performance made my eyes water.<br/><br/>I believe that Terrence Howard's performance was underrated. He's a terrific actor, well-known in the Black community before Hustle & Flow.

All the people are segregated in United States, but through this movie we can see that we are going to need help from other people, not exactly our race. In this country is indispensable to know that there are a lot of people different from us. This film is very powerful about the theme and all the characters' lives relations.

"hprice-jr","9","1","7","2 August 2005"," Emotionally and entertainingly involving
","It's been quite interesting to view all the diverse opinions of the film and felt I had to add my voice to the discussion.<br/><br/>The world of film is a rather tricky medium to tackle the subject of racism and no one film can encompass all the diverse complexities that prejudice entails. Let's not forget that a movies's first job is to entertain and enlighten an audience. Crash succeeds at this exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis has constructed a wonderfully involving movie that allows the viewer a glimpse into various lives that are touched by both economic and race issues. True, some of the characters may be stereotypical, but the core premise seems to be one of examining racism and the hope of redemption. The interweaving nature of the story and the surprises the characters face within themselves makes for a very entertaining ride. That's why we go to movies and a film like Crash is a good example of Hollywood doing it's job right for a change. Crash would have been even better had the characters been fleshed out more with a running time that was longer. This reviewer would have been more than happy to sit through another hour of material.<br/><br/>So if you want to see something that is both emotionally and entertainingly involving check out this great movie."
"PWNYCNY","10","1","7","25 July 2005"," Intense movie
","This has to be Sandra Bullock's finest movie. This movie marks her transition from a comic actress playing fluffy roles, to a serious actress whose performance must command respect. And this is why this movie is so great - the surprising performances. Tony Danza and Matt Dillon are wonderful in their portrayals of characters that are complex and not mere two-dimensional facsimiles of human beings. The Matt Dillon character is especially indicative of the intensity of this movie. Dillon plays an angry, bitter police officer who, despite his racist behavior and remarks, performs heroically and in the process redeems himself. For this movie is about people relating to other people on the basis of stereotypical beliefs that ultimately have no basis in fact. But the highpoint of the movie is Sandra Bullock's surprisingly compelling performance. Her character is so terrified and angry, and feeling so isolated and vulnerable, that she sinks to a depth of despair that is seemingly irreversible, yet she too survives, thus conveying a sense of hope and making this movie a powerful work of art."
"joker-4","10","1","7","23 July 2005"," GRAND CANYON of the 21st Century
","In 1991, filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan created GRAND CANYON, a follow up to his hit THE BIG CHILL, focusing on the lives of individuals from different classes in the great melting pot known as Los Angeles. Fourteen years later, Academy Award-winning writer Paul Haggis boosts the tempo on Kasdan's formula with CRASH. Instead of looking at classes, Haggis focuses on race relations and proves that not only does everyone in LA hate everyone else, they downright despise each other.<br/><br/>No one is safe in Haggis' hands, which beautifully amplifies the awareness all Los Angelinos must feel, as his cast of characters include questioning Anglos, surviving African-Americans, angry Persians, working Latinos and the downright criminal Korean. Much like in a Robert Altman film, this cast all interacts with each other in unsuspecting cyclical ways. The two misunderstood African-Americans who hate to be profiled end up car-jacking the very- whitebread DA and his wife. The white rookie cop has to deal with his racist partner and his callous captain. A Mexican locksmith becomes a scapegoat for a Persian shopkeeper. An African-American detective is in love with his South American partner. All these roles are admirable played by an exceptional ensemble cast, many of whom are not known for serious  or good - drama work.<br/><br/>The story focuses on events that try the souls of mankind: carjacking, fender-benders, break-ins, shootings, racial profiling; events that make citizens feel hurt, afraid and, most of all, angry. It is anger that Haggis shows so well and the emotion is cast from the screen like a betrayed friend. Haggis also substantiates that no one in the overpopulated metropolis of his film interacts or understands their neighbor, and that this lack of touch is a direct result of their own anger and fear  and it doesn't take Yoda to point that aspect out. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle's character, Det. Waters, so eloquently points out in the scene-setting opening moments, ""In LA, nobody touches you. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" Haggis takes the next hundred odd minutes proving his thesis statement on anger and fear in a dramatically beautiful way. He then surprisingly does something else: he shows that love still exists in the City of Angels."

"DICK STEEL","10","1","7","9 July 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Crash
","Crash explores racial bigotry and racial stereotypes, and is the equivalent of what Traffic did on the exploration of drugs. Given the strong ensemble cast and character actors like Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe and Sandra Bullock et al, this movie contains many subplots skillfully juxtaposed into one narrative by director/writer Paul Haggis.<br/><br/>We start off with an apparent random murder in a deserted part of Los Angeles, and from the start, racial disharmony rears its ugly head, and does so throughout. Whether be it White-Black, Black-Asian, White-Asian, White-Hispanic, Black-Hispanic, Hispanic-Arab, its off the cuff comments made by characters are starkly honest and probably expresses deeply rooted, prejudiced human emotions, and our preconceived notions of others, like if you're tattooed, you belong to a gang, if you're white and rich, you'll get mobbed by the black folks.<br/><br/>We're brought back 24 hours prior to the discovery of the body, and this is where the tight narrative takes control in managing different subplots, yet keeping the audience thoroughly engaged with each. You have a white couple experiencing a carjack, 2 black boys in the hood (one of them played by Ludicrous) and their adventures, 2 LAPD detectives who have more than a working relationship, the story of 2 beat officers on opposite sides of a situation, a couple and their misadventure with the beat officers, a locksmith and his daughter amidst a gritty, harsh environment, and an Arab family. Relationships between characters are also key, as they provide a probable insight into the motivations of each character.<br/><br/>Told in 2 acts, the first sets up the premise and explores a little of the current situation each character encounters, and touches a bit on their backstory. In the second act, this is where the amalgam and intersection of their lives come into play. And this really brings to light what six degrees of separation really mean.<br/><br/>I'll stick my neck out and state that the narrative has NO flaws! Awesome! The twists come so fast, you're still in awe when you're exposed to the next revelation, and the next, until we come full circle. None of the characters are who they really are, as the narrative goes on, you start to wonder, if Mr Good Guy is really that Good, and if Mr Bad Guy is really that Bad. All characters have closet skeletons, even the minor ones, be it whether exposing their true characters through conversations, or actions, or leaving it to the audience to judge for themselves.<br/><br/>It's amazing how the depth of each character, and for so many of them, are touched upon in the same movie. At some point, you hate someone for their prejudiced views or actions, and yet at another point, you pity the same person based upon the situation they're in. Or you might think that perhaps someone has demonstrated moderate thinking, but you'll be surprised still at the same person's subconscious harbouring of stereotypes. Most characters are shady, and this shadiness of character is present, be it if your social status or skin colour. All the actors did a commendable job in fleshing the multi-faceted roles they each play.<br/><br/>The soundtrack contains an excellent selection of songs, but my favourite has to be ""Maybe Tomorrow"" by Stereophonics, played during the ending. Arnold Schwarzeneggar also had an appearance, on a photograph as the Governor of California, which I felt was a nice contemporary touch.<br/><br/>This is highly recommended, please do not miss this, as it goes into my records as a possible contender for Movie of the Year, with its excellent foray into exploring human emotions."
"papa_romeo_","10","1","7","27 June 2005"," Crash-course in race relationships...
","If anyone has seen and loved 'Magnolia', with the stellar cast and fast paced interlinking of seemingly opposite characters, then this is a film that you can't afford to miss.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around characters from different ethnic backgrounds and deals with the stereotypes that surrounds the social cliques. It ranges from in your face racism to a Persian(not Arabic...) family by a redneck shopkeeper, to prejudice against Afro-Americans on afro-Americans, white on white, and Muslim on Latino. In a nutshell, it tries to cram as much as it can into one bundle of perfection. The story lines of each characters aren't massive, and they are all meant to cover 24hrs time wise, which means that the pace of the film never lets up.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the master strokes of the film. With such prolifically awesome actors, namely Don Cheadle and Ryan Phillipe you get an unsurprising yet great display. Then you throw in Matt Dillon, who is less well known for great films, Sandra Bullock of unsubtle action fame, Brendon Fraser of off-beat actiondom, all of whom excel in Crash in the light of ACTUAL acting. It makes the film just seem that much better.<br/><br/>I haven't said much about the plot, but thats because really it isn't the most important aspect. What IS the important reason you must see this film, is that it deals with issues so many films ignore. And especially, in post-9/11 America, where the president seems hell bent on trying to create larger problems for relations, it is important that people see th e consequences racism has."

It is not flawless, but subject is so good and its brutally honest with whites, blacks, Chinese, Spanish, you name it. No one gets spared. Should have been in my sociology class.

"NoArrow","9","1","7","8 June 2005"," Brilliant in every, single way
","Well, isn't this quite the movie. Uh-huhevery year, in my opinion, a movie is released that is made just perfectly. Made perfectlymeaning all of the acting, all of the writing, all of the directing, the music, the cinematography, the editing, the plot, story, all that, is just perfect. Last year that movie was ""Collateral"". The year before that it was ""In America"". This year, it is Paul Haggis' ""Crash"".<br/><br/>The film tells the stories of ten or so different people whose lives intersect over a forty-eight hour period, between two car accidents in LA. There's Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner-girlfriend Ria (Jennifer Esposito) investigating the seemingly accidental shooting of a black cop, DA Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his neurotic wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), a TV director (Terrence Howard) and his wife (Thandie Newton), two cops  one racist (Matt Dillon), one gallant (Ryan Phillippe); an Iranian convenience store owner (Shaun Toub); two college-aged black men (Ludicrous and Larenz Tate) and the innocent, victimized locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena).<br/><br/>Some of them have connections with others when the movie begins, but by the end they'll all more or less be connected by the prejudices and judgments that they store in their hearts over years of ignored ignorance. As the most interesting character in the movie puts it: ""You think you know who you are? You have no idea""by the end of the film, all of the main characters are at least starting to learn who they are.<br/><br/>How? Well, to give away even the smallest detail may spoil the experience, but let's just say that a lot of the characters meet through accidents, crashes if you will. A lot depends on coincidence, a lot on behavior, and a lot on prejudice. But everyone learns.<br/><br/>Ensemble movies like this are done a lot, I guess, but it always feels fresh and new when they're done so well, like with 1999's ""Magnolia"". This movie is clearer and more bearable than ""Magnolia"", which was a masterpiece in itself. It just so perfectly captures human nature  none of the characters are completely innocent, and none are one hundred percent guilty, either. This is shown perfectly in the characters of the two cops, through developments that I will not give away, but I will say that they are both brilliantly emotional and suspenseful.<br/><br/>And yes, the movie is suspenseful. It shouldn't be one of those ""boring dramas"" that action-and-stupid-comedy buffs seem to avoid. This is a movie that could draw anyone in, because everybody can find a piece of their soul somewhere in it.<br/><br/>Its qualities stretch far beyond themethis is an ensemble piece, an ensemble of talent. Writer director Paul Haggis has been around since the early nineties I guess, but with this so soon after his Oscar-nominated script for ""Million Dollar Baby"", I'm seeing him as a new talent. And he's good. If he plays his cards right he'll be able to ride the Hollywood horse in the way Spielberg and Tarantino are doing it right now.<br/><br/>And the acting  oh, the acting! It's superb, it's marvelous, every actor knows the soul of their character, and plays it excellently (even Ludicrous, who might just have an acting career ahead of him, unlike a lot of his rapper peers). Now everyone was good, make no mistake, but let me point out a few who were justextraordinary. Matt Dillon ranks in at number one, as the fierce, racist cop, who we hate from the start, but come to understand by the end. Sure, when he explains the roots of his prejudices, we roll our eyes, but imagine walking in his shoes? And he has a scene that will be remembered. And there's Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton as the black married couple, who each face prejudice on their own and together, and seeing them interact we thinkyes, this is a marriage. I knew Newton was great, but Howard is a bit of a surprise herea good surprise, he's more talented than I might've thought at first, and this is his performance. An Oscar, I say! Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Pena, Shaun Toub, Brendan Fraser, William Fitchner, Keith David, Tony Danza and Sandra Bullock all pop up in a few scenes or more, and they each leave a great impression. People like Tony Danza and Sandra Bullock seemed like a lost cause, but they do have talentthey've just been hiding it for a while. It's expertly displayed here.<br/><br/>Basically, I can't think of a single reason for anyone of a mature age not to see this movie. It's greatone of the year's best.<br/><br/>9/10"
"laske2","10","1","7","23 May 2005"," Touching just to feel
","In the clever opening sentences spoken by Don Cheadle, the movie's message is quickly understood. It is a movie about interaction, about the way we all come together for the most random and seemingly uneventful occurrences in our daily life. It plays with race relations involving the whites, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics. The dialog is always talking about race, but never does it go over the top to the point of becoming repetitive nor does it ever seem like we are being read an essay.<br/><br/>I must admit I was more than hesitant about seeing a movie in which Ludicrous played a major role, but he, and the rest of the cast, played some of the most interesting and real characters I have seen in a long time. They play roles of what should be stereotyped characters, but for some reason they aren't. Director and Writer Paul Haggis was able to stretch these characters stereotypes all the way without breaking the bonds that keep characters real.<br/><br/>Possible issues of concern for this movie are the way that the movie is so intertwined that it could be seen as ""unbelieveable,"" and its sometimes predictable nature. Where as I personally believed every twist as something that could happen in our daily world, I could understand how somebody may not. And as for its predictable nature, this is one of the few films where knowing what might come next really doesn't hurt its impact.<br/><br/>The movie, to me, sends reminders of the movie Magnolia, the way we are all connected through the most twisted of eternal plans. So if you enjoyed that movie I do not doubt that you will enjoy this one. It is, in all seriousness, one of the few movies I have ever wanted to stand up and clap for.

","I'm not sure how I feel about this movie. About half way through, I couldn't help but think ""This is the movie, ""Million Dollar Baby"" wishes it could be."" Rife with intertwining plots and subplots, all populated with fascinating characters all represented by the brightest and best Hollywood has to offer. Why do I compare it to ""Baby""? Only because, when I think of Best Picture awards, this is far and away what I'd expect rather than ""Rocky"" meets a ""Lifetime Original Movie."" That being said, I'm still not sure what I think about ""Crash."" Having seen Magnolia, and Amores Perros, I can't help but be reminded of those particular treatments as I watch ""Crash."" Sure there are plenty of stories involving synchronicity and chance events all involving a certain group of people who don't know each other, so I suppose it doesn't matter that it seems familiar.<br/><br/>All issues explored in ""Crash"" are relevant and very much deserve to be exploited in any way. I can't wait to read negative user comments to see why I should not like this film, because I think I really do like it a lot.<br/><br/>All the characterizations were nicely done. The casting involves a balance of talent and obvious beauty. None of the female leads were anything less than super hot in my opinion. The male leads similarly involved very good actors who happen to be very handsome. Oh well. Gotta fill those seats. Nobody wants to see average or ugly people on screen for 2 hours... I can excuse that since this is a product of the Hollywood system.<br/><br/>Even so, this film still had a certain gritty edge to it that absolutely worked with the narrative. All the intimate moments were suitably handled and any extraneous elements were absent. The score is very good. The acting and direction is right on. The editing is off the hook. The production design is seamless and awesome.<br/><br/>I believed and I cared and I was moved."
"DVLefferts","10","1","7","10 May 2005"," A Menagerie of Raw Human Emotion
","In the first scene of this film, Don Cheadle says, among other profound things, ""I think we just crash into each other, just to feel something."" This short quote, in actuality, sums up the entire point that the filmmakers were trying present. In the sleepy city of Los Angeles, the viewers are taken on a wild ride - perhaps a corny simile, noting the title - in the lives of numerous, nameless souls, all lost and confused. We see the lives of racial minorities living in the back alley slums of the city, and in the next scene, the lives of rich bigot whites. By the end of the film, we realize that whether black or white or rich or poor, we are all looking for answers, and that, although we do not realize it, those answers lie in the most unlikely people around us. A menagerie of raw human emotion - fear, anger, sadness, joy, and above all, dysphoria. Although it seems like quite a list to take on in one film, perhaps too long, Crash tackles them all with both open-mindedness and subtle restraint, in only 113 minutes. It took Magnolia three hours, and believe me, Crash leaves Magnolia in the dust. This wild ride of a film - by the end of it, the viewer will have crashed into the truth of their own lives, going home to their beds, popcorn stuck in their back molars, stunned - and emotionally drained."

","I read the script before the movie came out. I found it to be very tight, yet had clichÃ©s that bugged me, but there were a lot of touching moments. Then I saw the film. <br/><br/>If this film is not a catalyst for thought provoking conversations, then we have really, truly, lost our humanity. This is truly adult entertainment, and I am very impressed with all the actors involved, especially Ludicrous. I really respected what he brought to the screen, so maybe people shouldn't be so hard on Hip Hop artists turning to acting. Terrence Howard was riveting, as was the actor who played Daniel Perez with such compassion. It was nice to see Thandie Newton acting in a relationship with a black character. I never see her paired up with black male actors in screen ""relationships"". Ryan Phillipe and Matt Dillon were great..like I said, all the actors brought their ""A"" game to the table. The only bad part of the film is Sandra Bullock's character. She has a ""Driving Miss Daisy"" moment with her character where she tells the Mexican housekeeper that she's her ""only Friend"" when all through the movie she talks to the woman and treats her like sh*t, and there is no reaction from the housekeeper, not even a reaction shot! That rang very false and is one of the weakest links in the script and movie.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis and Don Cheadle (one of the producers of the film!) should be very proud of the work. I was. It gives me hope. And the next time someone cuts me off in L.A. traffic again, I won't be so quick to judge. We all have bad days."

The way it was filmed was stunning, so was the editing. I'd still say no part of it was perfect but since it doesn't really have weak points and everything gets along so well with no plot holes (at least no apparent ones), it's a journey through the lives and points of view of very different people, with no blaming of anyone... Simply a reflexion about ourselves, the human kind and the society we live in, all of this turned into the simple symbol of a car crash. <br/><br/>Such a complicated story told in such simple words. Nothing else to do than appreciate.<br/><br/>Of course it isn't for you if you want to have a laugh or a corny blockbuster but otherwise you wouldn't be reading this right ?<br/><br/>Believe me, it's impossible not to be in some huge reflexion when the lights go on at the end.

","A film stitched together with a very thick twine. This is how I imagine making of crash: 10 or so sitcom screenwriters were summoned and sat down at a table for 5 hours. Snacks were provided. The first task was: ""write down your recent experience related to race relations in the USA."" Something you have heard yourself, heard a friend talk about, heard on TV. Two hours later the writers were given the second task: ""write down a thickest racial and immigrant stereotype that first comes your mind."" Two hours later the pages were taken from the writers and put in a food processor. Well, an equivalent if it, some computer program that arranged the pages in random order. The screenwriters went on a lunch break. After the break the facilitator gave them a Power Point presentation of the written material and said ""please notice the main themes. Come up with 5 to 6 sub-plots and 8 to 10 characters that emerge from this material."" An hour later, and after a short bathroom break, the movie script was ready. No, I'm not kidding. This is how the movie MUST have been made. The rhythm of the film is like of a sitcom, only except bursting with laughter, the audience would gasp. The characters that are so diverse should be interesting, but they come out cartoonish. The process of shooting the movie must also have been speedy and sloppy. The actors talk like they are reading the script from a conveniently positioned screen. Considering the sloppiness of Crash, I'm surprised that the audience couldn't catch an accidental glimpse of such screen, with the dialogue scrolling, the actors in a daze, thinking about what they are going to do in the evening, not even paying attention to what comes out of their mouths.... There's the other side of the story: I'm very glad to see a popular movie about race relations, discrimination, prejudice, connections, etc etc in the USA. I'm an immigrant in the USA myself and, even with white skin, lots of BS is flying constantly my way in many different ways. When I try to point this out, most people act like they have not clue and they would rather change the subject. Prejudice and discrimination need to be talked about, written about, made movies about - with grace, with depth, with heart, with thoughtfulness... I'm waiting for a movie that will not only hit me with thick stereotypes, dazzle me with quick twists of the plot, startle me by its number of characters and the speed of the good guy turning bad guy turning good guy, but would shake my heart, make me wonder and feel and give me inspiration. I'm waiting for a great movie that will address the greatest subject of this century: where are we now in this melting world? Hope that Crash is just a small, shaky baby step in this direction, a strong stir in the melting pot, and that followers will come."

","I had to reedit this comment, because after just finishing watching this movie i was so overflowing with philosophical comment.<br/><br/>I'm sure another movie will come along which i'll give ten stars to and so i'll think of this one as 8.5 stars or somesuch. But for now, after just watching this, i'm saying two thumbs up! So for now, for me, this movie is on top in the way the whole thing is assembled, filmed and directed.<br/><br/>I am reediting my comments here, but this will be somewhat philosophical anyway, because, in short, this is what you will take away from a nice grounded movie like this.<br/><br/>What i liked about this best is that this movie actually made me emotional, in a ""English patient"" way (like few other movies do) which is probably why, when looking through all the comments on IMDb.com, there is lots and lots of opinion about this movie. I think that's the best a movie producer could hope for. And it is a reflection of the polarity this movie holds (the contrasting situations it threads together) And in a ""Mystic river"" way, in a few places i was thinking, but this is acting (like i was thinking when Denzel says f***ing in ""inside man""), yet it still drew me in and got me emotional.<br/><br/>Maybe what spurs me to give it ten stars is that, although there is a concerted effort by the makers of this film not to portray any good or bad sides of story or characters - any goodies V baddies rudder, or even good V bad BEHAVIOR - you CAN take away a nice sense of ""pay it forward"" closure, because, afterall, it's just a movie you can walk away from at the end. Trying to communicate this ""pay it forward"" theme to people who are jilted and can't get past their own preconceived ""goodies and baddies"" is something that resonates in my life right now, so that is why it holds so much meaning for me. I think me and the person who wrote this film truly see eye to eye in that sense. Yet it weaves this pay it forward theme in a very grounded way, in terms that give the film a stark ""real""ness, like ""mystic river"" or ""million dollar baby"". The way it ebbs and flows situationally gives it a reality you can get caught up in, and can then reflect upon in a tangible way when you come away, because it pulls you into a sense of realistic familiarity, like those aforementioned movies do, rather than being a ""escapism"" movie.<br/><br/>Something that drums through the film reminds me of Will Smith's ""six degrees of separation"" spiel. And so this is how the movie begins, as though the ""black guy"" takes this theme up where Will Smith in six degrees left off, and so i felt that this film was talking to me about that process of spirit needing to turn in on itself so that we ""crash"" with the people around us in order to help make poignant for us an arrangement on some other level, in place of some more formal social way of understanding of that arrangement.<br/><br/>This film took a lot of money to make so i hear. No special special effects or anything. But it shows. I remember after watching the mothman prophecies, i was after it thinking about how various ideas could have been portrayed better, or differently, and then i saw the making of that movie straight after, and so it made lots of sense when the producer kept arguing about the monies available and how much certain parts were being curtailed. I wasn't thinking about any of that after crash. This film truly reflects a good budget, like the producer got what he wanted."

It's not supposed to sweep the Oscars, the acting isn't supposed to be perfect, and it's not supposed to make perfect sense.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of racists who steal, get carjacked, get shot by blanks, etc... . Throughout the movie, the racists are taught and trained to become non-racists (in a very comedic scene) and then learn to deal with people from other races. After that, a whole lot goes wrong.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless drama'. It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic. The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Ludicrous does a good job.<br/><br/>Michael Pena captures the 'reluctant hero' role, and the kid actress does well as his daughter.

","I'm not sure who these people are that didn't like the movie. I have yet to meet any of them. As a writer, I was blown away by this script. This movie personified the very context of race in America. It was a raw, unrelenting script that left nothing behind. This story is not about deep rooted character development, it's about the deep rooted stereotypes of many of the races that make up this country. Every serious person in the industry as well as people, whose opinions i respect, highly rated this picture, including myself. I will go even farther to say that this movie is a great example of how people react to one another based not only on race, but on gender, religious and socio-economical backgrounds. I think people tend to miss the point because, as I imagine most of these bloggers are white, they tend to take it personally. They feel as though their own race is being attacked, when in reality, in the case of the District Attorney and his wife, the so-called ""wrong"" assumption turned out to be the correct one. All stereotypes are rooted in truth, however, they are usually incorrectly asserted to paint a broad brushstroke of the entire group as opposed to a select few. This movie is thought provoking, daring and superbly acted, directed and filmed. To dismiss it by calling it racist is just missing the point of the film. Crash makes us realize that we don't always know who we are until the moment of truth strikes us. It's in that moment that our true character is revealed."

","Perhaps I liked this film because of what it was not. Having heard that it was about racism, and had received some awards, I automatically expected the classic Hollywood treatment where the racists are easily identified by their southern accents, poor diction, use of politically incorrect terms, and obvious lack of education. This film took a broader view. Although many viewers seemed to think the film was dark and critical of humanity, I found it to be unrealistically optimistic because almost every character had some strong redeeming quality ... not true in ""real life"". If there was a general theme, it seemed to be that people don't really listen to each other ... because they don't need to ... by just looking at the person you know who and what they are ... and of course we know who and what we are ... so we already know everything. The tongue-in-cheek comedy sprinkled through the stories made it more digestible. I gave it an 8 out of 10."

I saw a trailer or two, picked up a opinion from a few friends, and conveniently moved it to the back of my mind: before I had saw it, I already had decided that I would not like ""Crash"". Last week I caved in. After reading praise after praise (and, conversely, bashing after bashing), I decided that I must decide if ""Crash"" was for me. During the opening credits and the first couple scenes, I sat there, in front of my television, almost waiting to be impressed. I scoffed at the extremely unrealistic coincidences, laughed at the petty jokes and was almost disappointed in that my initial opinion, that I would not like ""Crash"", had come true. By the end of the movie, I was in utter shock. Have you ever seen a movie that can *actually* move you? When was the last time You cried during a movie? When had you ever found a film that stopped your life, and said, ""wait a second, they're right. They're right. We need to change""? ""Crash"" is a knockout, a thriller that will aim right for your heart. I was emotionally ripped apart by ""Crash"", it is a brilliant tapestry of film making and an outstanding example of Movies at their Finest.

","While this film may not have been my choice for best picture, it was likely the best of the nominees of a mediocre year for cinema. This was certainly a step up from the academy's 2004 choice which in my opinion robbed superior films like ""Hotel Rwanda"", ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Eternal Sunshine."" Anyway, back to 2005: What makes Crash distinct is it's way of probing the viewers own subconscious. It questions the viewers own racial beliefs without ever condemning them for it. The events are somewhat unlikely and the plot relies heavily on coincidence, but the story transcends logic. This film features one of the best ensemble casts I've ever seen. Sandra Bullock stood out most to me as a white woman who reaches the paramount of her racism and ultimately winds up miserable and alone. This film is complex, deep and thought provoking - certainly Oscar worthy."
"MaxBorg89","8","1","8","12 March 2006"," Flawed but strong handling of a relevant topic
","First things first: I think the Academy made a mistake naming Crash the best picture of 2005. Not that I didn't like the movie: it just so happens that it has a few defects that make it less Oscar-worthy than fellow nominee (and strongest contender until the ceremony actually took place) Brokeback Mountain. That said, the movie deals with a serious issue in a bold way, and therefore deserves to be seen.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Paul Haggis, who also penned the beautiful Million Dollar Baby, Crash shares its title with David Croneneberg's 1996 shocker, but contains none of the latter's sex-and-death imagery or themes. Instead, Haggis' work covers 36 hours of L.A. life, with various, totally different people who ""crash"" into each other. They have nothing in common, except for the fact that in a way they're all racists. These people include a black cop (Don Cheadle), his ""Mexican"" mistress (Jennifer Esposito), a DA (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (a surprising, serious, angry turn from Sandra Bullock), a shopkeeper from Iran, a thief (Ludicrous) and his pal, and others. Their problems range from Esposito making fun of a Chinese woman's accent but at the same time shunning whoever mocks her descent to Fraser finding it difficult to honor an Arabic law enforcer named Saddam (okay, maybe he's got a point there), though no one is as troubled as officer Ryan (the justly Oscar-nommed Matt Dillon), a man so unpleasant even his partner (Ryan Phillippe) feels uncomfortable working with him. The worst part is, Ryan's aware of this problem, but doesn't seem to care that much about it (""You don't like me, that's fine. I'm a pr*ck.""). Still, he proves everyone can change when he saves a colored woman (Thandie Newton), whom he was molesting earlier on in front of her husband (Terrence Howard), from the film's central accident.<br/><br/>Crash has excellent, gripping performances (Dillon, Bullock and Howard shine above all), and that's what really keeps the movie together, especially in the epilogue where the script's weaknesses begin to emerge: as talented as he is, Haggis' decision to end his directorial debut with a string of coincidences is a partial disappointment. The bigger problem, however, is Ludicrous' character: with his erudite thoughts and philosophical reflections, he is just too artificial for a movie that aims to depict a realistic day in American citizens' lives. <br/><br/>Aside from these flaws, though, Crash is a good, thought-provoking picture. Maybe not Best Picture of 2005, but interesting anyway."

Crash left me with my jaw on the floor, and my tongue unrolling to my front door step. I was so blown away by this film that I was speechless the rest of the night. Paul Haggis's Crash runs it's story along the lines of a basic concept: No two individuals will be totally kept out of each others lives. Myself, and whoever reads this, will collide, Crash rather, into each others lives. Yet we may not realize it, we do make an encounter with one another at one point or another along the highway of life, we will pass by one another. Because as the inside scene selection guide of the DVD says, ""Traveling at the speed of life, we are bound to collide."" And this so true.<br/><br/>But it isn't the concept that took my breath away, that canceled every notion to speak, it was how it was presented, and the acting of Don Cheadle, who I also liked in Hotel Rwanda, and of Matt Dillon, who is up for the Best Supporting Actor award at this years Oscar's. It is this collaboration that set this film apart from the others I have seen this year. My advice for those who get a thrill from an Oscar worthy film, is to see this film, it is an instant classic in my book, and will always be.

A very honest and gut wrenching look at society and how we react to other races in common situations. Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Brendan Fraser, Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard and many others are so good in their respective roles that you become each of them in each scene. I really don't think any of the actors or any of the writing could have been any better than it was. Crash is one of those movies that everyone should see. The writers and the directors give each scene and situation such obvious tender loving care you feel as if you could be witnessing the scene downtown. I did esp since I lived in Los Angeles most of my life. They present you with separate and amazingly real story lines and throughoout the movie then they present you with a beautifully woven and whole story that touches every fiber of your being by the end of the movie and you are left wondering how they did such a good job. When this movie was over I sat and just thought about all of the different situations that they wrote into this script and I couldn't come up with one that I couldn't identify with in a good or bad way. I'd be curious to know if they filmed different endings for each ""segment/story"" and why they decided on what they did, however they did it, it got my vote!! <br/><br/>If this movie is passed over for an Oscar I may never watch the Academy Awards again. I believe it deserves best picture but I will settle for some individual actor awards, or screenplay awards. This movie was several hundred strokes of genius.

","Crash tells many different stories. It involves many different people. However, all of their lives are inadvertently linked together through one accident.

I felt particularly bad for the Spanish locksmith that Sandra Bullock's character thinks is a gang member, and then we see him arrive home and discover he is a struggling single father.<br/><br/>What I liked even more about this movie was that it really makes you think. Besides the racism, it has another message, and that is you can look at any fender bender anywhere in the world, and the people involved all have their stories, and it all connects. There are so many subtle moments in the film that when you see them, you don't think anything of them, but when you see the ending, it all comes rushing back.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is really good. This is probably one of Sandra Bullock's best roles, and it is definitely Matt Dillon's best role. Paul Haggis is an awesome writer and director, and I can't wait to see what else he comes up with.

","Right from the opening credits I knew that ""Crash"" would not be your everyday, pop - it - in - the - microwave - and - don't - pay - attention -while - you - watch - TV - and - eat - your - tasteless - dinner distraction. This movie makes you sit up and open your eyes wide. The film follows seven groups of people from varying racial and socio-economic backgrounds as their lives become intertwined through a series of violent events: car crashes, armed robbery, the aftermath of robbery, police brutality and assault. The events are terrifyingly believable. Director Paul Haggis demands and gets superbly honest performances from the entire cast. Although the film unapologetically declares racial prejudice and its consequences as its most obvious theme, its discussion of this horrifying problem is subtly nuanced, and at its heart the film discovers genuine remorse and compassion. ""Crash"" is equally gritty and sensitive without indulging in anger, despair, or sentimentality. It is profoundly heart-breaking and also profoundly, but not stupidly, optimistic. Hell, it's just plain profound."

It's fascinating how the movie works as a fantastic essay about contact and communication, and how it conveys its meaning perfectly.

Crash also shows that strong endings needn't require the main character to commit suicide, etc. the way the stories of the characters concluded may seem idealistic, happy-ever-after but was probably appropriate considering the tension that was raised right from the start of Crash..<br/><br/>Crash allows people to confront and overcome the racist and anger that we keep inside us and protect to keep face.. even Ryan Phillipe, who seems to be an impartial, open person, shows he is human after all, and in some way his knee-jerk shooting of the African hitch-hiker reveals a racist part of him.. what Crash does put out is that there are far more challenging and miserable things in life to worry about than the colour of our skin or our accents..<br/><br/>the most memorable scene was when the Iraqi shopkeeper - and prob most of us - thinks he killed the locksmith's daughter, and the mother breaks down, but it turns out there was no ammo in the gun and the girl's fine.. later the Iraqi shopkeeper tells his daughter he was protected by an angel..<br/><br/>while most will probably turn to more relaxing films - certainly Crash isn't one of them - Crash is one of those films, like Passion of the Christ, where you must see it once and be changed.. i think it's probably a bit more tolerable than Hotel Rwanda or Munich.."

It underscores the need to grow beyond them to surmount the challenges that we face. On the racism front, it presents a refreshingly balanced view of the rather knotty issue of discrimination. The protagonists oscillate between being racist and being 'human'. The tendency to be self-obsessed has also been attacked meticulously and the last few scenes where repentance for the same is expressed by one of the actors do leave a lasting impression"

","One of the best movies I have seen over the last couple of years. Even though different stories are told they all blend together and make you realize how easy it is to judge and be prejudiced. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat constantly, at times it makes you angry, sometimes it makes you melt, other times it makes you laugh. The acting is great across the board. Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle are brilliant in their roles. It made me realize that their is good and bad in all of us and that the two co-exist.

"ilovedolby","10","1","8","4 February 2006"," Compelling and Powerful Like No Other Film of 2005!
","Paul Haggis, the writer of the Academy Award Winning ""Million Dollar Baby,"" makes his directorial debut in the year's most compelling drama, ""Crash."" Unintentionally, Haggis has created a film about race relations in Los Angeles, however, the situations could relate to almost any American city. What is unique about the many characters is that through their discrimination, be it serious or in jest, all present fallacies on the parts of others. Yet, they all speak from a perspective where the viewer, of any ethnic background, can find reasoning in their racial profiling. It is as if the film acknowledges racism, finds understanding and sympathy for it, and then manages to show how absolutely detrimental it is not only for society, but the individual person as a whole. By writing the film in such a way where the characters can be understood by the viewer, Haggis allows the audience to be intimate with those characters. We know that their assumptions are dead wrong, but we never find ourselves truly hating any of them. Take Matt Dillon, for example, who plays a racist, sexist cop. On a routine pull-over, he makes a black couple get out of their car. He frisks them both, but actually gropes the wife. In a later scene, we see this same woman, played by Thandie Newton who has gotten into a terrible accident. She is trapped in her burning car. Who should show up and save her life, but the same cop who accosted her. This is actually one of the films lighter moments of genuine intensity through emotion. But what it represents is the hypocrisy of all the characters. This was a racist cop who pulled this husband and wife over because they were black, and he groped the woman. Yet, he is here saving her life and wants nothing more than to protect her from a horrible death. Watching ""Crash,"" I felt so affected by its brutal honesty and ability to unite its many characters into one giant understanding of the story as a whole. It is the most powerful film to tackle race relations since Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing."""

"ignatz928","2","1","8","16 June 2005"," Absorbing but doesn't hold up to examination
","In Hollywood movies L.A. is most commonly used as just a convenient location for stories that could just as easily be set anywhere. Some of the few exceptions can be found in films like Magnolia and Short Cuts, which explore a web of interconnections between people in ways that seem particularly suited to a sprawling city like Los Angeles. Drawing on these earlier movies, the recently released Crash, which I saw last week at the downtown theater with my sister, concentrates on the specific issue of race. Writer-director Paul Haggis structures the story as a series of racially charged connections between both strangers and acquaintances. Over the course of about 24 hours these characters are all forced towards reckonings with how they deal with race. Haggis has certainly delivered a compelling and well-made movie, with beautifully moody, blue-hued cinematography and editing that is refreshingly controlled for a modern Hollywood film. Other than Don Cheadle, I'm not familiar with most of the ensemble cast, but they turn in excellent performances. Haggis has received some criticism for the coincidences that his screenplay is built on, but I can't say I minded; Crash is infused with enough style as to make it clear that it's not intended as documentary-style realism, and so I was able to accept the coincidences as a Dickensian device for juxtaposing different segments of society. Despite all of these virtues, the screenplay has a number of flaws that ultimately diminish the movie's power. Taking place over about the time of one day, the script has the characters go through dramatic transformations, and while some are justified by the story's dramatic intensity, others, particularly those experienced by a rookie cop and a black TV director, are overly schematic and unconvincing, turning flesh-and-blood characters into pawns in the director's grand scheme. The movie contains several scenes of the characters placed in harm's way that some viewers might find manipulative and overwrought but which I found to be legitimately compelling; there is, however, at least one too many of these moments. One of the difficulties in making an ensemble film has to be keeping the different characters' stories in balance; because many of the characters are set up as protagonists, and not as supporting characters who nudge the story along, there's less leeway in the editing room for removing subplots and tangents that don't turn to work. In Nashville and Magnolia, for instance, there were several characters who had obviously fallen prey to the need to keep the movie to a manageable length, rendering their function in the story more or less incomprehensible. Here, the character of the DA's bitchy, racist wife, played by Sandra Bullock, doesn't prove to be very interesting. Moreover, the crisis that befalls her and prompts self-reflection- she breaks her ankle falling down the stairs and is helped by her Hispanic housekeeper- comes right after several more intense scenes, including a car crash and an armed confrontation. At this point I began to get the feeling that Haggis was just piling on one catastrophe after another. The way in which Haggis keeps the issue of race throughout the film is less than subtle- in every single scene he contrives to have the characters discuss racial issues, so that after a while the movie starts coming off as an after-school special with four-letter words."

","I have rated this movie a 10, only because I feel anything less would not do justice to this phenomenal film! The movie has a faint similarity to the movie ""Go"" in regard to the way it was directed. I love the fact that there was one big story line, and then little inter-winding stories, and they were beautifully tied together. The movie does a fantastic job of portraying racism, and how it affects everyone. There was not a dry eye in the theaters!

","Before I went to see this movie my friend gave me a warning. ""Don't blink, cause you might miss something."" I didn't need the it, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. It is one of the ten best films I have ever seen. There are a few funny/ironic moments and some moments when make you let out this sigh of relief and it occurs to you that you have been holding your breath for most of the scene. Crash has brilliantly interwoven the lives of the characters into each other so amazingly well it's hard not to notice some degree of similarity in your own lives. Through the entire movie you are taken on an emotional roller coaster, where characters become than they seem to be and they make you start to think a bout some of the people you encounter in everyday life. I walked out of Crash wanting a few minutes to process what I had just witnessed. After as I talked about the movie with my friend I could feel that raw emotions I felt as I sat in the theater. Especially discussing some of the more dramatic encounters the characters had. As soon as this movie comes out on DVD I'm buying it."
"flipgirl38","Null","1","8","3 June 2005"," Powerful, Hard Hitting Drama About Racial Stereotypes
","In Paul Haggis's feature directorial debut, Crash, several different characters walk the streets of Los Angeles, their minds already made up of the different ethnicities that surround them. Because of these stereotypes, not one character is able to clearly see the people that stand before them. And it is in that universal characteristic that makes Crash such a wonderful film.<br/><br/>There is no better place to exhibit the loneliness, pain, and fear in America better than Los Angeles, which is a melting plot of different cultures within a twenty mile radius. Watching a film such as this questions your own views on how you see people of different races, as well as surprises you at how quick we are to judge someone who is not like ourselves. No on exhibits this finer than Sandra Bullock's character, Jean, who is only too quick to judge a Latino locksmith as a gang member. Jean is so blinded by these racial stereotypes that she makes, she does not even realize her actions till the end of the film, where she comes to realize her Latino housemaid knows her better than her supposed white friends.<br/><br/>The Latino locksmith, as it turns out, is the furthest thing from a gang member. He is a family man, with a wife and angelic little daughter to whom he tells a sweet story about an invisible and impenetrable cloak that renders her impervious to all harm. That little story comes back into play when a Persian immigrant, whose store was broken into and ransacked, tries to take vengeance on the locksmith by threatening him. What ensues is one of the most climatic and heart pounding scenes I have seen on film in quite some time.<br/><br/>Yet this is simply skimming the surface at the amount of character development and characters that are involved in this film. We have Don Cheadle as a detective who is having an affair with his Latino partner, Matt Dillon is a somewhat corrupt cop who performs an inappropriate search on a light skinned African American woman that comes back to haunt him. Ludicrous is a man who car jacks white people's cars and sells them to a car garage, all the while preaching about how white people give the ""black man"" a bad name when he is giving the ""black man"" a bad name himself. So much is packed into only 100 minutes that I only wish that these characters had more room to breathe with their intertwining stories.<br/><br/>There is amazing use of score throughout. A score that hauntingly fits that chaos and tragedy that fill this picture. THe music alone may very well bring you to tears, it is that moving and in perfect synchrony during a car crash scene where Matt Dillon rescues a woman trapped in her car. This is what thematic score is supposed to e: symbolic to the characters on screen.<br/><br/>Crash is a powerful and moving film that is not to be missed. Paul Haggis has debuted with a hard hitting drama that will hopefully be remembered come awards season in 2006. I can only wait to see what this remarkable screenwriter and director has in store next.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended"
"Bob Pr.","9","1","8","1 June 2005"," Excellent, powerful, thought provoking, unique
","This movie is unlike any other movie I've seen and probably that'll be true for most viewers.<br/><br/>There are approximately 9 important couple relationships (husband-wife, child-parent, working partners, etc.) somewhat explored as they interact with each other as well as many others. Our appreciation of these couple relationships is deepened by seeing the variety of forms they can take. E.g., a child protecting a parent (or vice-versa) is presented in several iterations and the contrasts between them deepens the impact of each (probably implicitly, without even our awareness that the film is doing that). They come from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds -- black, oriental, Latino, white, Middle Eastern, etc.<br/><br/>The lives of these various people collide in accidental but natural and seemingly inevitable ways. In each collision people make quick judgments about each other often based on racial or ethnic stereotypes, especially when people are fearful or hurt. It's part of the power of this film that as viewers we find ourselves doing the same thing, too. Another power is that it demonstrates people are far more complex than putting a person in the box of a stereotype allows.<br/><br/>Although all the accidental encounters between these couples COULD seem contrived, everything flows realistically, naturally -- including all the dialog. The casting is great; the acting superb. The snippets presented of the lives of these 17 or so people are interwoven to form an overarching, coherent, powerful narrative.<br/><br/>This is not a movie that will change many lives, especially among those who treasure holding their ethnic biases. It will appeal most to those who grieve that we all so easily form and hold such stereotypes.<br/><br/>Rated ""R"" for some natural, adult emotional language and a sexual scene. AFTER you view the movie, your appreciation will be furthered by visiting the IMDb message board and reading the discussion on this film there."

But unfortunately it takes something so traumatic and severe to open your eyes. Then you see the cycle repeat over and over (ending of the movie) It's hard to pick one direction.

","I saw this movie on the recommendation of a therapist and friend of mine. I left the movie realizing one thing: we never really can imagine that our preconceived ideas of others, can be so wrong. We are all human beings, driven by the same needs, facing the same fears, wanting good in our lives, and all too often we don't realize how universal this is. To make this movie just about race is entirely wrong, it is about the human race. Though I think that the interaction and dissimilarities of the different characters (Korean, Persian, black, white, rich, poor) is typically of our American culture, I would imagine it applies on a universal level as far as the prejudices we hold as humans. We hear it from our parents who heard it from their parents, prejudice runs in families for generations, no matter how educated, rich or poor we are. The D.A.'s wife (Jean) sounds the same as the young black characters, she simply held back more. In the end, I felt good and enlightened by this movie and realized how every word I say and thought I have, is often in some way and indication of the prejudices I hold about others, some I seriously need to address, others more innocent, but prejudice nonetheless. I salute Paul Haggis for this most eye opening movie."

"themovienazi","10","1","8","23 May 2005"," A slice of life that you shouldn't miss!
","Crash was a film of exceptional quality that you don't often see anymore from our large Hollywood institutions. An independent film that pushes the envelope and comes close to reaching the limit that most everyday audiences hold for entertainment. I find the most entertaining films also to be the most stimulating, and without a doubt, Crash delivers one hell of a punch. The basic tenant of this film is the ""everyday people"" scenario that insightfully develops the lives of several characters that live in a world where race matters more than most are willing to admit. Since our heroins can also be considered villains for their decisions (if you solely stick to the perspective of Hollywood writers,)it brings a level of realism unattained by most films excluding those such as ""American Beauty"" and ""Traffic,"" which forces the viewer to relate on a much more personal level, rather than a fantastic one. I could spend hours analyzing the characters one by one, but I would rather not ruin the awesome ability of this film to penetrate one's psyche. Cras may seem a little too convenient in its cyclical plot, but life itself comes with so many coincidences that we tend to ignore them for the purposes of a breathable reality where every decision is not a painstakingly rational one. In my opinion the film tells the truth about what think about, what we want to believe, and what we actually see. The best film I have seen in years, and the best so far this year. See it my friend. Please, see it!"

I don't think I've ever seen Sandra Bullock play a role like this before. Of course, Don Cheadle delivered with no problem. But that is to be expected. I was also shocked at ""Ludacris"" and his performance. He played his part very well. I suggest that everyone go see this movie as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed. Every scene of the movie is important and says something about racism in a way that people don't anymore. It lets us know what people are still thinking about other races, but try to pretend are just ""stereotypes"". As I said before, go see the movie, you will enjoy every moment."
"joemystery2004","8","1","8","14 May 2005"," This one cuts hard and deep.
","Paul Haggis' ""Crash"" is a movie that makes us ask the worst questions about ourselves and our own racist inclinations. Where do these thoughts come from? Are these thoughts inborn or are they learned? A beautiful ensemble piece, Crash examines modern day Los Angeles in a 36 hour period where several events have the lives of about 15 characters converging. There is no performance in this film that is wasted. No actor doesn't pull his or her own weight. I won't go into deep character details. I'll just call out a few standouts.<br/><br/>First, there's Matt Dillon, who in my mind is a lock for a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his role as a racist cop. His villain is so multi-dimensional, that you hate him, empathize with him and identify with him. Superbly acted, Dillon never misses a beat.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle also delivers a great, subtle performance that may earn him a lead Oscar nomination simply because he clocks more screen time than Dillon. It seems that Cheadle, a great black actor who isn't showy or cocky like his peers, is finally getting the respect he deserves as an actor. Oh, how I would have loved to see the dignified and humble Don Cheadle accept the best actor Oscar over Jamie loud-full-of-himself Foxx. That would have been a great day for black cinema.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of talk about Sandra Bullock's fine performance. And it was a good performance. I was surprised how easily Sandra Bullock abandoned her cheeky, comedic stupidity for this role and transformed herself into this largely plausible and detestable character. However, she will not get nominated for an Oscar. That I can almost guarantee. If she were to be nominated for an Oscar, it would be in the best supporting actress category and two actresses from the same movie are rarely nominated in the same category. (RARELY - It has happened) I say all this because Thandie Newton, whose performance is second only to Matt Dillon, is sure to garner this actress her first nomination and maybe even a win (it's too early to tell. I can't really see any supporting female players topping this performance.) Thandie Newton's performance as a violated wife of a black socialite is also multi-layered. Now, my brother has said that he dislikes roles where people are yelling and carrying on. He says that it's too easy. Is it? I don't think so. Showing gut-wrenching emotion is difficult because you have to straddle that line between believability and maudlin. Some people can do it. Some people can. Newton can.<br/><br/>This movie may garner nominations for director, picture and screenplay, but I'm loath to say definitively at this point, simply because of mixed reviews from critics. Had it been released a little later, it would have had a greater chance. However, I still have a feeling that ""Crash"" linger in the minds of Academy voters and be recognized for the bold, standout film that it is."

Crash is definitely on my must buy list. It is also a movie I believe needs to be shown in schools. It is an honest, somewhat dark brutal truth of todays society, and Crash makes you stop and realize it. A true 10 out of 10, one of the years top 10 best, and certainly the best drama. GO!

"DeeNine-2","10","1","9","5 February 2007"," Remarkable take on the clash of cultures in L.A,
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>Crash was a surprise winner of the Best Picture Oscar for 2006. It's a message movie and the Academy obviously liked the message. The message is that racial intolerance is untenable if you really stop to think about it and see people from some point of view other than your own.<br/><br/>What makes this work is a brilliant conception and adroit direction by John Haggis, a believable script by Haggis and Robert Moresco, and fine film editing by Hughes Winborne. All three won Oscars. They were able to preach, as it were, without preaching. By putting people in positions of racial and ethnic irony, they show us that racial prejudice is absurd. We see events that could happen to anyone regardless of race or ethnicity. We also see that supposed stereotypical behavior that we may hold against another race or ethnic group is sometimes exactly what we do themselves. The movie points to the truth that everybody is prejudice in one way or another.<br/><br/>The story itself is about several people whose lives accidentally come together (""crash"") in the ethnically and racially diverse, sprawling City of the Angels. There are two young black guys who could pass for UCLA students (they think since they're in the Westwood area) who hijack the SUV of an LA politico, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) as he and his wife Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) are driving home. There's a double irony here because one of the guys is complaining that people are afraid of them because they're black in a white neighborhood even as they move toward the hijacking! Later we meet the mother of one of the black guys whose brother Graham (Don Cheadle) is an LAPD detective who tells his mother he's bedding a white woman, Ria (Jennifer Esposito) who he thinks is Mexican, oblivious of the fact that her parents are from Puerto Rico and El Salvador! There's quite a bit of this ironic confusion about race and ethnicity in the movie, the point being people tend to see others as stereotypes of skin color and language without really being aware of who that person is as an individual. A Persian shopkeeper is thought of as Arab. Hindus are thought to be Muslim. Thais are Chinese. Ignorance is the basis of racial and ethnic prejudice, is part of Haggis's message. And he's right.<br/><br/>One of the most beautiful sequences in the movie begins when Shereen (Marina Sirtis) buys some bullets in a gunshop for her father, the Persian shopkeeper. (Pay attention to those bullets!) Later we see Daniel (Michael Pena) talking to his daughter Lara (Ashlyn Sanchez) who is hiding under her bed because she is afraid of the bullets that used to go off in her old neighborhood. Daniel gives her his invisible, impenetrable cloak to wear to protect her, taking it off and putting it around her. Later when the Persian shopkeeper comes hunting Daniel because he thinks Daniel tore up his store, Lara runs to protect her dad who no longer has the impenetrable cloak! I won't tell you want happens. You have got to see the sequence yourself.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon plays a racially prejudice cop who could pass for a young and less sophisticated real life ex-LAPD Det. Mark Fuhrman of O. J. Simpson trial infamy. He is the central character in another interesting sequence beginning with his groping shakedown of a black man's wife.<br/><br/>The stories meld together in a way that reflects how Los Angeles is a cultural melting pot--or is it a salad bowl? The stories that intertwine bring out the underlining preconceptions and prejudices of the people of that salad bowl (or melting pot) in a way that is more effective than a dissertation or documentary might be. Yes, there is some contrivance, but I think it's fair to write that off as poetic license.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most amazing thing about this movie is that although it won the Best Picture Oscar it only cost about $6-million to make. It's one of the most original films I've seen in quite a while and one of the most effective."

We see a number of different people - some blatantly racist, like Matt Dillon. Others are the victim of racism - like Terence Howard and Thandie Newton as his wife. Others, like the Iranian store-owner, just happen to be victims of their own limited communication skills.<br/><br/>There are various ways this film can be read and a number of messages implied from the various sub-plots. At the end they all preach tolerance and humanity if we are to lead civilised lives as part of a diverse community.<br/><br/>What makes this film superb is the calibre of acting. There are a number of known faces all giving solid performance. There is no single star. Its very much an ensemble piece with nicely fleshed out characterisations and plots which intertwine neatly in the end to show how everything is related. I rate this higher than that other great ensemble piece Robert Altman's Shortcuts because the characters are more fully developed."

","Crash is a movie that everyone should see, because it explores the dark world of prejudice and how the people feel about one another.<br/><br/>It is intent to change the way we act; to avoid paradigm; and tries desperately to move us with its emotions.<br/><br/>With an all star cast, includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, and Brendan Fraser, Crash takes us along for the ride, giving us the experience of depression, anger, fright, and sometimes relief. There are some bumps in the ride, some cheesy scenes, but is overpowered with some very powerful scenes.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis did an extremely well job directing and writing this Oscar winner picture; the cast did another well job acting, making us believe as if this is real life. I'll guarantee you Crash will make you wonder about the real world, and how the problems are affecting us to live happily ever after."
"aatkinso","4","1","9","31 May 2006"," ""Crash"" brings nothing new to the table
","My '4' is motivated primarily out of my admiration for any filmmaker who wants to tackle a major social issue with his art. Too few do that, though it seems 2005 was a bit of a rebound year for political pictures. Also, I think ""Crash"" would have made a solid first two episodes of a TV show. (Maybe after a season, I might have gotten to know the characters.) Some decent acting, some nifty editing.<br/><br/>Those things aside, I must say that this was incredibly difficult to get through. I saw it in September '05 after I'd heard good things about it, and I was very excited to see it (as I always am with smaller pictures that get good reviews). But almost immediately, I could tell this screenplay was going to be painful.<br/><br/>""Blackest thing you've ever done is watch 'The Cosby Show'!"" ""At least I didn't do it with the equestrian team!""<br/><br/>Or something to that effect. I mean...really? Is that really the dialogue? And in what universe do people verbalize *every* *little* *racist* *thought* that comes into their heads? The most pressing problem with contemporary racism is that people refuse to even acknowledge their own racist tendencies, not that people say ""spic"" too much. Prejudice is something much more elusive than offensive words.<br/><br/>And the characters. Here he/she is doing one thing, and now here he/she is doing something that appears to be...the antithesis! End of character arc. What school did Mr. Haggis go to that allowed him to think this was acceptable screen writing?<br/><br/>And then the over-arching message of the movie: Racism is bad, and we should all work to end it. And we can! If we really, really try!!! Bold message in 1965, but do you have anything new to add, Mr. Haggis? No? Then why am I watching your movie? Maybe if I thought about race like a child (and apparently some people do), I might have found this movie worthwhile, but I don't, and I didn't.<br/><br/>The fact that this beat four outstanding nominees for Best Picture speaks, ironically enough, to the prejudice of Oscar voters against a movie that actually does bring something challenging to the table, be it that the struggle to inform as well as entertain via television may have been lost (Good Night, and Good Luck), or that being a great artist can mean manipulating people and selling your soul (Capote). <br/><br/>Neither of those messages made voters feel good about themselves, though - and ""Crash"" did."

I'm not Matt Dillons biggest fan and believe him to be quite a wooden actor but he performed brilliantly in this as did most of the cast who aren't all renowned for their cutting edge acting....but in this case all were superb!! Acting aside the film deals with racism and stereotyping terrificly, and confronts some difficult issues with apparent ease. I admit I held certain prejudices before this film and admit I still do to a point but this film changed my opinion in so many ways to so with race related issues. If more films were brought out like this the world would be a better place. It a truly inspiring film and really serves a vision of how life could be if everyone was as open minded as the cast eventually portrayed and how just simple little things can make our lives and society in general a safer and more amazing place.<br/><br/>My 10/10 score I feel is justified as the film itself is superb, the story is wonderful and the cast are brilliant!! even Ludicrous was pretty good albeit a very safe role, but still very decent! one word...WOW!"

"blanche-2","9","1","9","21 February 2006"," Excellent look at racism, assumptions, and prejudice
","Paul Haggis has done an amazing job writing and directing ""Crash,"" which gives the viewer a glimpse into the lives of several people and shows the effect of racism, making assumptions about people based on stereotyping, and how prejudice has invaded all of our lives. Haggis' film style reminded me a little of Robert Altman's films and a little of ""Magnolia."" Granted, the subject is racism, so the stories all involve it, giving one the impression that every single person in America is prejudiced 24/7. And maybe we are! Maybe it's so deep-seated sometimes that we're prejudiced without even realizing it and make decisions based on these prejudices every day. Haggis asks us to examine ourselves while we're examining this microcosm of people.<br/><br/>There is some wonderful acting in ""Crash"" - that of Sandra Bullock, Thandie Newton, who is particularly powerful, Matt Dillon in a performance that should take his career in a new direction, Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, Brendan Fraser et al. - all first rate.<br/><br/>The gun show salesman who calls a store owner ""Osama,""; the store owner who accuses a locksmith of trying to cheat him; a DA's wife who is convinced this same locksmith will copy her keys and come back later to rob her; the policeman with problems at home who acts horribly toward a black man and his wife and then becomes a hero; making fun of the way someone talks; being disrespectful of your Hispanic housekeeper who is probably your only friend - rage, rage, and more rage. When Haggis shows us the full human being in many of these cases, stripped of their race, profession, color, accent, wealth or poverty - all they are is people - angry, vulnerable, afraid, and hard-working.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a provocative film with many riveting sections - both scenes involving Newton and Dillon are astounding - and the encounter at the locksmith's home has one of the most frightening moments you'll ever experience. In the end, you're left with the realization that we're all the same, and by making assumptions about one another, we put up walls, we spoil what could be a decent situation. ""You think you know who you are?"" Matt Dillon asks Ryan Phillippe. More importantly, do we recognize the other person for who they are?"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","1","9","15 February 2006"," No one is good or bad
","From the moment I heard of this film, I knew I had to see it. I could hardly wait. Luckily, I didn't have to wait for long; now, two days later, I got to watch it. I must say, as high expectations as I had for the film, I am still thoroughly impressed and very short of in awe. The film offers no escape from the real world; look elsewhere if that is what you seek. It doesn't force it upon us, either; It rather shows us realism as it is. No cynicism, no ideology. Merely an unbiased look at the world of prejudice. The hate, the fear, the mistrust... and more importantly, what it leads to. We are introduced to these people, people of all ""races""(ridiculous idea, really, that of races; and quite outdated) and religions, we connect with them and understand them... and then we see them being prejudiced against or them prejudice against others... or both. And we understand. The effects of prejudice. That no one is good or bad; everyone just... is. Everyone does what they believe is right, regardless of persuasion, religion and nationality. The film plays like a TV-series, meaning it changes scene back and forth between all of these characters, which works very much to the film's benefit. The plot is amazing, it develops marvelously and it keeps your interest throughout. The pacing is perfect, I wasn't bored for a second. The cinematography is beautiful. The dialog is real. The acting is astounding, with many of the actors playing against their usual character. There was no performance that I felt was the least bit flawed or poor. This is the first film that has truly 'gotten' to me for a while... well, at least in the two-going-on-three weeks since I watched The Story of Us, and even that doesn't compare in quality(though it may in emotional impact). It shows excellently how much of an impact(and how negative and vicious it is) prejudices have; there's a scene where two characters of different races interact; one is caught in a death-trap and the other attempts to rescue her. And the frightening and disturbing thing is... she's more afraid of him than of the possibility of her imminent death. The film contains much foreboding... many plot developments may at first seem predictable, but most, if not all, will still surprise you. The only thing keeping this from a perfect rating, the one thing that brought it a little down for me is that Asians just don't seem to get the attention that all other nationalities get here; there are people from the Middle East, there are Latinos, there Black people and many, many white... but there are only two or so Asian characters, and they are the only truly stereotypical and thin characters. That derives from the greatness of the rest of the film, which is a grand example of film-making and story-telling. Maybe the film should have been longer, maybe some other characters should have been cut... I don't know. Another, somewhat minor, but still important complaint; the film talks down to its audience a bit too much; it's as if director/writer Paul Haggis expects the viewers to possess no sense of logic. Things are explained in unnecessary detail. These two things bring the film that one step back, prevents it from being completely perfect. Too bad. It was pretty darn close. I recommend this to anyone and everyone... just make sure to be prepared for an unpleasant look at reality... rather than an escape from it. 9/10"
"juvenile-2","8","1","9","4 June 2005"," POTENTIAL SPOILER: Are the only Asians in this Film Stock Characters and Extras?
","I won't rehash the plot since others have already done so. Although I applaud the film for its frank approach to racism, I can't help but feel that the Asian characters were treated in a very cursory and shallow manner. There is no fully-realized and complex Asian character in a film that supposedly looks at a broad spectrum of cultures that make up contemporary Los Angeles. We get a shrill ""dragon lady"" stereotype with broken English and a mild-mannered Korean man who has barely two lines in the entire film and turns out to be a snake-head/human trafficker. . . And don't tell me the insurance guy counts. Paul Haggis, I commend you for your work, but if you wish to have Asian characters in a film about race relations, please take the time and effort to create someone with depth, feeling, and all the complexities of your competing characters."

","Synopsis: A Brentwood housewife and her DA husband. A Persian store owner. Two cops who are also lovers. An African-American television director and his wife. Two carjackers. A Mexican locksmith. A rookie cop. A middle aged Korean couple. They all live in Los Angeles. And during the next 36 hours, they will all collide.<br/><br/>This movie was a very emotional 2 hour ride. A look at the affects of racial tensions in our perfect land of opportunity, Crash is confrontational, though not radical. It teases us with what might happen and what could happen but then cushions the blow with light humor. Sadly, the issues raised in the film, specifically racial intolerance are perpetuated by the things we laugh at....and the laughter kept the film moving.<br/><br/>It was very dramatic. Unpredictably dramatic. I think every actor in the film read the script and said, ""This is my Academy Award!"" They all brought the drama! Seasoned actress Sandra Bullock played completely against type which was refreshing. Rapper Chris Bridges (aka Ludicrous) did an excellent job for only his second film. And the UFC is not a fan of acting rappers. I love Don Cheadle and his portrayal of the jilted good son was exceptionally moving. Actually, the whole movie was moving. Now where it moves you, I can't say. Some may reflect quietly, others may move to the exit . If you don't prefer intense dramas...go see something else.<br/><br/>We all look at people we don't know or don't understand and draw conclusions, some bad some good. This movie did a very good job of demonstrating how destructive that aspect of human nature can be. And yet, how inevitable it is. One of the things that I think makes a good movie is how much you think about it after and how much you talk about it. Crash will give thinking people plenty to discuss."

","""Crash"" (2004), the 2006 winner for Best Picture, deserves every bit of that honor. Directed by Paul Haggis (who helped write the upcoming James Bond film ""Casino Royale""), it is a masterful direction that really works due to its intelligent and evenly-paced script (also an Oscar winner for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen) dealing with racial issues in Los Angeles, as well as the right ensemble cast to tackle the subject matter. Of the actors, the best ones are Don Cheadle as Det.

","This was one of those kind of movies where after you see it everybody kind of leaves the theater in silence which is definitely what happened when I saw ""Crash"". People did not know what to say because I believe it left you with so many things to think about. It was just that powerful which can sometimes leave you speechless!!!!! The audience in the theater was of a mixed crowd who could relate. People who only believe what they see on the news about race relations should definitely see this film. It was shows ""the hush-hush"" conversations that are said ""behind closed doors"". The cast is marvelous! I was totally surprised at rapper/actor ""Ludicrous"". He definitely held his own with the rest of the great cast-from Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Larenz Tate and Matt Dillon to Keith David, Loretta Devine, Terrance Howard, and Thandie Newton. It was also good seeing Tony Danza and Jennifer Esposito on the big screen. And lets not forget Brenden Fraser. The script is smartly written and the characters say what a lot of us think but are afraid to say. The scene with Terrance Howard and Thandie Newton being frisked and violated by Matt Dillon's police character was like something out of a ""Civil War"" epic the way the slave-masters would use their power over slaves. The encounter with Sandra Bullock and the Hispanic locksmith said a lot especially in the fact that while he was installing her new locks and she was making false accusations against him, he in turn was trying to protect his own family by moving them into a nicer neighborhood. The one that hit home for me the most was when Ludicrous talked about not robbing black folks but he turned right around (being a hypocrite) and tried to car-jack Terrance Howard but then Terrance turned the tables on him and let him see how embarrassing he was not only to him but to himself as well. This movie definitely dispels the myth about people looking at other people and ""not seeing color"" because they do. Color is first, gender is second, and the human being themselves is last."

","Crash, is about the lives of several people who deal with racism in some way shape or form in their everyday lives. Crash, has good direction, a good script, good performances from everybody involved, good original music and good cinematography. There were many things I liked about Crash, and then some things I did not like about it. The film deals with racism and that is the main theme of the movie but the director focuses on it so much that after awhile it feels like he is trying to teach a lesson on it and makes us his students watching an educational film on racism. I thought it went a little overboard and after awhile it felt like the movie was nothing more than a film trying to show us what is right and what is wrong and how miserable these people are because of it. The film also gives us a moral ending that maybe we will be all better if we change our ways and are not racist. The film also felt like sometimes it wanted to shock us with these racist characters and situations just for the sake of shocking us and make the world a better place and get it's morals across but at the end the film doesn't have much to say other than do this because it is right and don't do that because it is wrong. And near the end of the movie I felt like the director was trying so hard to make us care about these characters and identify with them that it almost got a little sappy. It's like he wanted us to cry or feel depressed just to get this message across but it doesn't work. At least for me it didn't. The film is also jumbled and doesn't deal with having so many characters in one film too well and during the second half of the movie it started to get slower and felt like it dragged at times. The film started out good and it has some good scenes and is interesting for the most part and has good performances but ultimately I found the movie too preachy about it's message and the film is so concerned with it's message that it does little else with the film. I still enjoyed the film enough with it's performances and involving first half but because of this relentless preaching and the jumbled plot of the film I don't think it is the masterpiece critics are making it out to be."
"geniuswoman","10","1","10","15 May 2005"," evocative and poetic
","Crash is poetry in dramatic form. Is it realistic? Yes, but not in a way that we should expect to meet these characters in our daily routines (just as we wouldn't expect to experience the same kind of love/lust/longing depicted in poetry). Its realism and power is derived from clearly articulating the intensity of the frustration and intolerance that lives beneath our consciousness. This movie should not be berated for its hyperbolic characters and coincidental encounters  they should be recognized as devices (brilliantly employed) to generate a sense of involvement with and personal responsibility for the reality of racism and selfishness. Racism is the central theme of this film, but it is not an end in itself. Rather it is the means through which we see how we construct and cling to the notion otherness (whether it be race, class, or religion) in order to define our sense of self. The different segments and encounters are mean to illustrate how connected we all are, simply by virtue of being alive with a common purpose  to be happy."
"oshram-3","10","1","10","14 May 2005"," Powerfully done drama
","Crash deals with an automobile accident that touches the lives of several people in L.A. Cheadle leads the movie as Detective Graham, who is rear-ended at a crime scene, which kicks off the movie. The rest of the two hours shows us how we got there, following the threads of several different seemingly disconnected lives and showing how in fact they all influence one another without ever meaning to.<br/><br/>Crash does not always come together; it's a little hard to get into because we aren't given anyone to latch onto, and at the start the movie stakes a claim that deep down where they live, everybody's pretty much a prick, more often than not (excepting a character named Daniel, played by Michael Pena). The people we meet are not always sympathetic  in fact Bullock pretty much plays a racist jack-ass  but they are always honest and real, even if they can be unpleasant. Ludicrous in particular is saddled with a character that could have been played as comedy, the young black male who sees an anti-black motivation to everything in the whole world; but in this film, the character comes off as realistic as any other.<br/><br/>Where Crash excels is in betraying your expectations. One person is set up sympathetically, and he turns out to be a jerk; another is set up as a jerk, and he turns out to have a solid core. Not every character is a twist, and not every situation relies on irony, but there's enough there to make a central theme in the film. In lesser hands this could have played out poorly, but Crash is so deftly orchestrated that there are some moments of dramatic payoff in this film that most movies can never hope to achieve; and some of them, you don't even see coming, which is even more welcome.<br/><br/>Bullock's obnoxious character is given a brief moment so strong toward the end that it brought tears to my eyes; likewise a speech given by Cameron, a black TV producer (played expertly by Terrence Howard) to Ludicrous' thug character at the end is very, very strong. Ryan Phillipe has a few excellent scenes, though his is a lesser role than some of the others. But the two most powerful scenes in the movie spring from directly opposing desires in the viewer  one an act you desperately don't want to see happen, and one you do.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon plays a racist cop who is forced to come to the aid of a woman (Thandie Newton) he harassed; the initial scenes with their characters don't play out that strongly, but when they confront one another in literally a life-and-death situation, the emotion is so powerful it leaps off the screen at you; probably five minutes of some of the best film-making I have ever seen. Likewise, the one wholly positive character in the film, Daniel, captures our sympathy almost at once, and his scenes with his daughter are tender and unaffected, very natural. When suddenly she is put into danger, the viewer can't help but react strongly (several people in the theater gasped audibly); what happens there, again, is simply brilliant, brilliant film-making, drama at its finest, reaching off the screen and touching us where we live.<br/><br/>Crash offers no easy answers, and everyone in the film must come to some difficult realization about themselves. It's not always an easy film to digest, and it plays with some ugly truths about people, America, and our society. But its very lack of a pat ending, its very unwillingness to wrap up the story in any sort of convenient way, make it a much stronger film. Though not a flawless piece of work, Crash is so strong in so many areas that even though we have more than six months left, it's hard to contemplate a better film being released this year. So often you hear ads proclaim ""one of the most powerful dramas of the year."" Well, those words would be true of this film. I don't know if Crash is playing everywhere, but you owe it to yourself to see this in the theaters if you can  though the drama is so intense that it will still play well on DVD, I would imagine."

The expression is eloquent and sharp as a scapel. But beware, this movie's points about racism and human nature are as powerful as any religious, political or academic ones you've ever heard. And since most people 'can't take the truth' to borrow a famous tag line, that's a problem.

","The gem of this film is the dialogue. All characters speak their own languages so naturally, you won't find a single moment that they are actors talking out of a script.<br/><br/>This is a film about racial tension in America, and more specifically, in the LA area. It's about prejudice against races other than one's own. In order to make all these happen in a less than two hour movie, serendipity has to be the norm to gather white, black, latino, Asian, mideastern all together in a story during a 36 hours period. So it might not make any sense when all these characters always run into each other, but you would not have time to question that during the film, because you will be completely captured by racial conflicts and the emotion they provoked. Will you get offended? Probably so. Will you find some traits of yourself in those characters? More than likely.<br/><br/>None of those characters in the film are perfect, and more or less they are prejudicial against others. I think that most people in real life are this way. Some people are more this way than others. Some people are more reluctant to admit than others. Some people act upon those prejudices more than others. That's the reality in our society and that's why I like this film because it doesn't cover up the feelings of those characters with political correctness, and the film let those characters speak their minds.

Some people may realize that they don't know themselves, some may realize that they are like some of the characters in the movie (too judgmental), some may stop giving racial stereotypes, and some may pray to Saint Christopher. Crash is a social commentary that puts prejudice of all kind into perspective.<br/><br/>The way it is filmed shows the chaos of LA and of people's lives. It could make the viewer see the chaos in their own lives or they could feel their lives are less chaotic.<br/><br/>Overall, good film...slow beginning, but good film."

","This movie is an awesome journey. It is amazing that in the year 2005 that our racial harmony is still not where it should be. Crash takes you on a journey through the lives of multiple characters interwoven together by similar events. This movie has the feel of Magnolia by Tom Cruise which was so well done.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast in this movie was awesome. Each played their part bigger than the movie itself. From the very opening credits of this movie you are drawn into the world of this movie. Most importantly for me you care about the characters. Some of the characters were a little underdeveloped, because of the complexity of the plot, but what you lack in development you more than make-up in implied backstory.<br/><br/>If you didn't know this movie deals with race relations. It was interesting to watch this movie in an audience that was diverse. Some of the more prevalent stereotypes in our society was explored. They were not explored in an ABC after school special way, it was explored with very graphic imargery and language. It is a reason this movie garnered an R rating. I really feel that the language used in this movie was needed, to understand the depth of the issues dealt with. Many of my Christian readers will be offended by this language and a brief sex scene, but I think you should go see the movie anyway, because the story is bigger than that. Remember the Passion got an R rating too! This is best movie of 2005 to date. I would have given it a 10 rating, but I didn't want to eat that if something greater came out this year. But this is a remarkable film that I feel every one should see. This movie will make you think twice about your own life and whether or not you are making unjust stereotypes on another race or even your own race.<br/><br/>M.L.K. dream is still not complete and this movie helps to show us how we can make it happen. Go Crash into your favorite theatre to see this movie.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10, because it will go down in cinematic history! And it will win an Oscar!"

","A movie with a message should present it with respect, clarity and responsibility. Movies like Get Out, Do The Right Thing, 13th and even (as silly as it is) Zootopia and various kids shows present these themes about race in some sort of respectable or, at the very least, in a thrilling, engaging way that leaves the audience stunned or a bit smarter when the credits roll. A movie that gets its point across without being an inconsistent mess.<br/><br/>Crash isn't one of those movies. In fact, it's the movie delivers its message in the most rough, uncomfortable and most obvious way possible without carrying about anything else in the movie including its characters and it's plot.<br/><br/>This is a movie so abominably and unapologetically horrible that it shocks me that to this day, people enjoy this garbage. There are literal Sesame Street episodes who present the same message in a better, more adult way than this rated R, indie, Academy Award winning flick with stars all over the production.<br/><br/>This characters (for the most parts) are one dimensional, cardboard cut out, generic stereotypes of the races and group represented. There is a twist where 2 black people talking about how their viewed as menaces who people are afraid and that they should be more scared because of everything else and that they're just normal people, mere seconds before they pull out guns and robs the state attorney car. The movie is trying to prove a point to not stereotype everyone but using those same stereotypes as our characters and its driving force for the plot. None of it is realistic in any shape, way or form. The only thing you get from these people is that they're just douches who are racist in one way or another (except Michael Pena's characters but we'll get to him) and they have a half baked change of heart through an event knocking some sense into them.<br/><br/>The technical filmmaking (i.e lighting, editing, and cinematography) would be fine but then you realized that it won an Oscar and you realize ""what?, how?"". The editing just consists of basic, film school entry level transitions and cuts with some other ones consisting of pretentious shots carried by the generic, pretentious, operatic score. The score does absolutely nothing but try to hammer in how flashy it is with the same tune used over and over like in the part where Sandra Bullock falls down stairs or how its used when Michael Pena's daughter is shot and its supposed to be dramatic, instead of hilarious due to the editing.<br/><br/>Let's talk about those 2 for a second, Sandra Bullock plays a racist, rich, white woman who's the district attorney's wife. She's racist because of the incident of the carjacking and says some racist things due to anger, falls down some stairs, hispanic housekeeper takes her to the hospital and is not racist. This is basically the end of most subplots from this movie. They either end like that or just abruptly end at the climax like Michael Pena's subplot. Also, was there not a single other take for that scene. You're telling after days and days of working on the movie and editing it, nobody decided to use a better take or tell the director something isn't right? Did nobody explode in laughter when they rewatched the footage and see how terribly and hilariously flawed it is and shouldn't be altered in a better and a serious way. It's possibly the worst scene in the movie by far with a character who doesn't really seem to be bad and good since he's done nothing really racist.<br/><br/>Most reviews on here on talking about ""at the end of day, everybody's good and bad', but that's clearly not what's trying to scream at the choir. In one scene Ryan Phillipe's character (a rookie cop) is in a car with Larenz Tate's character and because of suspicion that he has a gun and a fit over country music (no kidding) and decided to just burn the car that they were in and hide the body and then it just ends. It's like if you were downloading something and then (at 97%) it just cut off.<br/><br/>To describe Crash in simpler terms is to describe a rich entitled prick named... Amy, she's the most well known girl across the school, she's very rich gaining a lot of unneeded things Lambo's and jewelry. She's also in the cheerleading team and despite her being the worst and weakest out of all them, she still gets undeserved praise and awards for no reason other than she's popular. She also couldn't care less about anything the next one night stand or how she's ""getting fatter"". The only time she does care is to talk about how white people/men are bad and refusing to delve more into topics other than the basic shallow level knowledge that everyone else feed her. She just says a couple of words and then leaves"

","If you've been searching for the most complete and perfect representation of what so many people in the West actually think, this movie would be it. A perfectly crafted, paint-by-numbers path to race relations in the West but, primarily in the US. There is no way any decent human being can watch this and not come away moved or shaken by the extremely deep and visceral NPC programming portrayed in this film. If you want to really understand the lens by which our betters see our nation then you're going to NEED to watch first Birth of a Nation, then Crash. The former is no doubt a more realistic and unvarnished look at modern America but the latter is a superior theatrical performance. They should have entitled the film, Birth of the NPC since it captures the true depth and illumination of not only the mind of your average, every day NPC, but their commitment and unshakable belief in the purest of dogma. Perhaps most devastating rebuke of nuance and critical thinking in a movie ever witnessed this film is the pilgrimage for all real NPCs who not yet have been corrupted by facts, or evidence, or the ever present threat to bubbles everywhere.<br/><br/>Evidenced by the fact that the critics have crowned this movie as their own personal example of a serious and moving drama, it informs us that without a shadow of a doubt, these people actually do exist. Not that the evidence isn't already constantly swirling around us from nearly every corporation and government institution coming together, working hand-in-hand, to ensure that each and every one of us is as woke as they want us to be and we all owe them a debt of gratitude for such enlightened entertainment; never has it been more undeserving.

","Most people would agree that America is obsessed with race, certainly its politicians of a certain political bent are. This film is set in Los Angeles only a decade after the O.J.

All the same it is difficult to believe that all the principal characters would have been as obsessed with race as they are portrayed in this film, and it isn't only the whites who are bigots.<br/><br/>Weird happenstances and outrageous coincidences happen every day, but those herein beggar belief, and would a police officer really have sexually assaulted a woman in front of both her husband and his own partner during a traffic stop? In 1985, Anthony Pacho was indicted for fondling shoplifting suspects; although the former Glendale police officer would eventually plead guilty at Los Angeles Superior Court to lesser charges, it is most doubtful if a veteran officer would have jeopardised his pension with the sort of outrage depicted here two decades on.<br/><br/>As for the redemption in this film, bad people can do good things, and do all the time.

","Race is paramount in this film, and all our preconceptions of who people are get twisted and turned through the intricate plot. With each new additional character we find another assumption, another stereotype, and then watch as that preconception is obliterated as the character develops. It is a credit to the deftly written script, tight direction and exceptional acting talent that every one of these many characters is fully realized on screen without ever feeling one-dimensional.<br/><br/>I would love to discuss some of the details of what happens to explain how well it is done, but part of the magic of this film is allowing yourself to be taken on this ride. Mind you, this isn't a ride of pleasure. The first half of this film is unrelentingly in its ferociousness. I could literally feel my rage at some of the characters forming to a fever pitch. The fear and hatred I was confronting wasn't just on the screen, but in the pit of my stomach. And in one absolutely brilliant moment I was literally sobbing at the expectation of horror unfolding, only to be cathartic-ally released in a most unexpected way.<br/><br/>Mr. Haggis was in attendance at the screening I saw and explained that the idea for this film came to him one night sometime after 9/11 at about 2 a.m. when his own memories of a car- jacking experience from 10 years before wouldn't leave him alone. Clearly this film was his way of relieving those demons of memory, using the catharsis of his art to unleash them and in doing so has given to all viewers of cinema an opportunity to examine our own preconceptions about race relations and how we treat each other and think of ourselves. He mentioned in the discussion after-wards that he likes to make films that force people to confront difficult issues.

There are lots of crashes, mostly attitude-attitude as well as physical.<br/><br/>There is a nose-tail car incident very early on which is repeated at the very end.

The good cop can't cope with the bad cop and tries to get transferred, but runs up against ingrained issues at the precinct and later makes a bad, bad mistake, the consequences of which are not explored.<br/><br/>How many main actors are there?

It is lacking when it comes to a compelling story, which is clearly what this movie wanted to be, but because we are following so many different characters it becomes hard to feel for any as they are all underdeveloped, there's not a single character who's potential felt fully used. As far as Best Picture winners go, it lacks originality, there's not a single story that we haven't seen in another movie, or a character that feels fresh, it's too dedicated to being realistic that it forgets to offer something exciting or different for its audience.

Graham (Don Cheadle) is a police detective whose brother is a street criminal, and it hurts him to know his mother cares more about his brother than him. Graham's partner is Ria (Jennifer Esposito), who is also his girlfriend, though she has begun to bristle at his emotional distance, as well as his occasional insensitivity over the fact he's African-American and she's Hispanic. Rick (Brendan Fraser) is an L.A. district attorney whose wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock), makes little secret of her fear and hatred of people unlike herself. Jean's worst imaginings about people of color are confirmed when her SUV is carjacked by two African-American men -- Anthony (Chris Bridges, aka Ludicrous), who dislikes white people as much as Jean hates blacks, and Peter (Larenz Tate), who is more open minded. Cameron (Terrence Howard) is a well-to-do African-American television producer with a beautiful wife, Christine (Thandie Newton). While coming home from a party, Cameron and Christine are pulled over by Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon), who subjects them to a humiliating interrogation (and her to an inappropriate search) while his new partner, Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillippe), looks on. Daniel (Michael Pena) is a hard-working locksmith and dedicated father who discovers that his looks don't lead many of his customers to trust him.

Here are some points I show interest in this film of coincidence: 1, Don Cheadle, is the man I have seen in hotel Rwanda and the iron man? Nice play as a very contradictory detective with a drug-addicted mother and a thief brother I have to admit. 2, Ludicrous, my dog, you are always a star in my heart since your cool play in fast and furious series, it's a character showing braveness but stuck in wrong commitment of racism, but he and I both see the silver line when the second last scene which he release Asian stowaways, that means he has turned that false commitment back, started to do what do not EMBARRASS himself. 3, racism is the main phenomenon linked to the theme, but who can deny that? Arrogance and bias is just there existing in people's mind, Chinese are so smart to not to express makes China much more harmony than the free world. 4, cop, which is citizens' defender, make it really contradictory in this film. Ryan is that bad cop which stop a black man's car, search his wife's body boldly, and intimidate them, but save life from a crashed car which faced explosion. Tom is that good cop which has consciousness refusing to corporate with people like Ryan who is of racism and guarantee the movie director been hurt by Ryan and him not been hurt, but killed a black man because of his deep-heart racism. 5, ""she is the angel"".

It is simply amazing. I won't try to use grandiloquent language to share my experience. In short, the film will give you a tour of life in 2hrs. I learned a lot from it. The film has some brilliant gray characters which are beautifully portrayed, and that's life..Everybody we meet is gray..Evereybody is a combo of good and bad. The movie might will blow you away by its magical simulation of chaos and how one event leads to another. It depicts the intertwined lives of people and how chaos affects them. The movie might will help you in several ways..It provokes a lot of disturbing questions which we all need to answer. It would make you introspect your mind using these questions. There are many things in life which we do or which happen to us that we can't let out..we bury them inside, and those things gradually make us weak. This movie might help those people who carry such baggage. it'll make you understand that there are things which are beyond your control and you don't have to blame yourself for every single thing that happens to you. So I say take it easy..Watch this movie and stop being cynical (if you're). I would recommend it to each and every movie buff.<br/><br/>PS- The movie won't offer anything to people who are looking for entertainment..(Though, I found it highly entertaining)."

","I will admit, Crash is a very emotional movie. It depicts the lives of strangers and how we're all so connected yet distant from our neighbours. Racism is at the centre of this movie, and prejudice seems to cause countless problems in everyone's lives in one way or another. There's constant battles between doing good or bad and overall, this film is definitely entertaining both on a superficial and mental level. <br/><br/>Although Crash was a very interesting movie, I felt the amount of drama was overdone and it almost seemed artificial at instances. Don't get me wrong; there certainly were moments of genuine panic and relief. But at specific moments, I could easily distinguish the storyline as fabricated when I really shouldn't have been able to, and this reduced its otherwise strong relatability. <br/><br/>The acting in this film was excellent. Performances from actors like Michael Peña and Matt Dillon really pulled this film together and were by far some of my favourite scenes. The perfect settings and contrast between different lives really give this movie an edge and is the reason I, among many others, truly enjoyed this film from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I definitely think the racial themes addressed in this film were very revealing--though arguably a little plastic--and helped relate this movie with modern times. I am glad I watched this film since it shows the stark disparities between two individuals, and it highlights the numerous parallels as well."

","This film didn't really seem like my cup of tea, but I kept it on and really got into it. There is some really fantastic performances in this film. I really liked the way all the different people's lives were interlinked. Although I really thought the film was going to end on a downer, I was happy that some of the stories turned out well. Especially the locksmiths story it was a huge relief to find out his daughter wasn't accidentally killed. I thought Sandra Bullocks character was far too outwardly racist and don't really think there would be anyone that vocal about it. Their story was probably the worst. Don Cheadle got what was coming for him and Ludicrous' story ended with a nice touch."

","I have watched many films in my life, yet for some reason this one has eluded me for quite some time. Anyway I finally decided to watch it and boy am I glad I did.<br/><br/>""Crash"" beautifully mixes racism in society and combines it with the butterfly effect (for those who may not know the butterfly effect is the belief that a small change in one place can lead to an overall big change), to give an incredibly interesting look in to attitudes on race in society. There was honestly not a moment in this film in which I was bored, but there was a sex scene within in the film which I didn't understand the purpose of as it didn't feel like it belonged or was even related to the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>All of the actors play their parts incredibly well, I was particularly impressed with Sandra Bullock as well as Ludicrous as it felt like they totally embodied their roles. You truly end up caring for all the characters and understanding what they have to deal with from their point of view and yes awful things do happen to some of them. Yet the movie doesn't beat you over the head with it's message, it lets you come to your own conclusions. Is this movie totally depressing?, No. is it thought provoking?, Yes no other movie has made me think about myself as a human being more than this. It may be hard to find but Crash is a movie about progress and within its message there is Hope.<br/><br/>Now the only reason for which I have not awarded this movie a 10 which in all honesty it probably deserves, is simply due to the movie poster. For some reason whoever made this particular poster decided to give away a major plot detail. That is all. Other than that it is the perfect film."

","The 2004 film Crash takes the audience on a roller coaster ride through the lives of many characters. The film, co-written, produced and directed by Paul Haggis reflects on the racial and social tensions in Los Angeles, California. The film stars, Graham Walters (Don Cheadle) and Ria (Jennifer Esposito) who play police detectives in the film, who are dating and intertwined with Peter (Larenz Tate) who is Graham's brother in the film. The film also includes Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock) who are carjacked by Anthony (Chris ""Ludscris"" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate). Also starring in the film are John Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his partner Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) who are corrupt Los Angeles police officers. Additionally, Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) are pulled over by John, after the two display unusual behavior while driving. The story reflects on the lives of all these characters, how they are all connected, and how racism is relevant in today's society.<br/><br/>The major theme reflected on racism and the social perception. The movie placed a great deal of emphasis on racism, including scenes of Daniel (Michael Pena) going into a store and being treated badly because of his race and tattoos by store owner Farhad (Shaun Toub), while attempting to buy a gun. The two have an altercation, and Daniel leaves the store. Irony plays a part in the scene where Anthony and Peter are walking down the sidewalk and the two discuss how they were victims of racism and poor service based on their skin color. Shortly after having this discussion, the two hijack a SUV driven by Rick Cabot with his wife Jean as the passenger. The story begins to unfold and you begin to see the connection between the characters.<br/><br/>While watching the film, I recall having a similar feeling while watching American History X. Primarily, because of the strong emphasis placed on racism. There is often a lesson to be learned in dealing with movies that focus so much attention on racism and the perception that society accepts this behavior.<br/><br/>The motif of the film was relevant throughout, and related to the theme in the aspect that racism was consistently displayed. The lighting, often times dark and somber, also played into the theme. Racism is not bright and cheery, it is disturbing and dark.<br/><br/>Though this movie contained a high dose of reality in what people go through on a daily basis, it did so with ease. Even though the characters were divided, they were still somehow connected."

","The gray area of prejudiced behavior and blatant racism plays across the volatile melting pot that is Los Angeles. The white elephant (pun intended) is bold, provocative and, except for plot run-ins and tie-ins, very un-Hollywood-like. Various angles paint a very un-black and white picture where racism is neither attacked or defended. It's just laid out as one big question. Where does common sense end and racism begin? The concept of crashing into one another did not pold any water with this viewer, but the reality we all deal with certainly did. Our cast is shown to cope with their own emotional versions of the truth, with heroic honor and self revelations."

","The successful and popular writer and producer Paul Haggis convinces with his second ""Best Film""-Oscar-winning production ""Crash"" after ""Million Dollar Baby"". He implements the ethnic conflict in Los Angeles in an emotional action-packed film full of socio critical scenes. The viewer explores the racial attitudes and stereotypes which can not only be found in L.A., but also in most cities all over the world. Haggis has created a film which provocates to think about the conflicts everyone is involved in, but also is an intense criticism of the actual situation.<br/><br/>The action takes place in Los Angeles over a time lapse of one and a half days. The car-jacked couple, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), the LA District attorney, and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock), raises their stereotypical prejudice against others from different ethnic groups, for example their Latin house hold help or the Mexican-American locksmith Daniel Ruiz (Michael Peña). The car-jackers Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate) experience a mind change and a tragical event based on a misunderstanding through the prejudice of Officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillipe), who first seems to be the person who trusts most in strangers without stereotypes and criticizes his partner Officer John Ryan (Matt Dilon) in his racial action. There are also Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and Christine Thayer (Thandie Newton), who are flagged down by Officer Ryan for no cause; and the African-American police detective Det. Graham Waters (Don Cheadle), who is having an affair with his Latin partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito). All characters are bound to their personal development, they are forced to reassess their thinking and point of view against other ethnic groups. <br/><br/>Haggis has created a breath-taking film, which illustrates the conflict between ethnic groups very well. He also makes use of different cinematic devices to let the viewer witness the 36 hours development and identify with the characters opinions and thoughts. The viewer undergoes the process of the mind changing of the various characters, which are all elaborated very detailed and represented in all of their attitudes. Many emotional situations are existing as well as thrilling and pulsating moments. The created atmosphere according to the mind changes does also develop and electrifies the audience. The whole production forces the viewer to also change his mind, as the topic is still actual and biases and racial assumptions are occurring all over the world at this very moment.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Haggis created a very critical film, which deals with a very actual and intense topic. He shows the development of the different characters very well and detailed as well as the various stereotypical thinkings which are existing in everyone. ""Crash"" can only be recommended because of its extensive elaboration and the implementation of the still current topic: racism.<br/><br/><ul><li>by Fabian Finke and Kevin Kreker -</li></ul>"

","Several stories interweave during two days in Los Angeles involving a collection of inter-related characters, a police detective with a drugged out mother and a thieving younger brother, two car thieves who are constantly theorizing on society and race, the white district attorney and his irritated and pampered wife, a racist white veteran cop who disgusts his more idealistic younger partner, a successful Hollywood director and his wife who must deal with the racist cop, a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop, a Hispanic locksmith and his young daughter who is afraid of bullets. The movie shows that people are born with good hearts, but they grow up and learn prejudices. Which, in turn bring out bigotry and racial stereotypes. The setting in Los Angeles, a city with a cultural mix of every nationality. The story begins when several people are involved in a multi-car accident. From that point, you are taken back to the day before the crash, seeing the lives of several characters, and the problems each encounters during that day. An LAPD cop (Matt Dillon) is trying to get medical help for his father, but he is having problems with a black HMO clerk who won't give his father permission to see another doctor. He in turn takes out his frustration on a black couple during a traffic stop. A socialite (Sandra Bullock) and District Attorney (Brandon Fraser) are carjacked at gunpoint by two black teenagers. Sandra takes out her anger on a Mexican locksmith who is changing the door locks to their home. Later that night, the locksmith is again robbed of his dignity by a Persian store-owner. Many of the characters switch from being bad-person-to-hero in ways. Farhad (The Persian) thinks Daniel (The Mexican) looted his store, so he grabs his gun and goes to Daniel's house. He threatens to shoot Daniel and Daniel's daughter runs outside to protect him because she has the invisible cape. She jumps into Daniel's arms and Farhad shoots her. It turns out that the bullets were blanks and the family goes inside and Farhad is left to think what he did. Peter and Anthony (Ludacris) try jacking Cameron's truck. Peter is left behind as Cameron and Anthony speed off. They are cornered by police. Cameron is finally fed up with the prejudice he sees and steps outside and tries to get shot. Officer Hanson recognizes Cameron and orders the officers to put down their guns and forces Cameron back into the truck. Cameron drops Anthony off. Peter tries to get a lift later and Officer Hanson picks him up. As they're driving, Peter notices the statue of St. Christopher that he carries along at starts to laugh. Thinking that Peter is laughing at him, Officer Hanson orders him out. As Peter goes to grab the statue, Hanson thinks it's a gun and shoots Peter. He sees what he was really reaching for and freaks out. He dumps his body at the side of the road and burns the car. We end with the beginning, where Det. Waters investigates the crime scene. We find out that in fact Peter was his brother. Anthony ends up riding the bus but gets out when he sees the Chinaman's truck, keys still in the lock. When he takes it to the chop shop, they find out there's a bunch of Asian immigrants in the back. Georgie offers 500 apiece for the immigrants and the money is excepted. The End :)"

These people are all different yet all alienated, to the point of breaking, so much so that when they come together, things explode. he complexity of the film comes from the encounters between characters and their tangled lives and worlds. Race is paramount in this film, and all our preconceptions of who people are get twisted and turned through the intricate plot. With each new additional character we find another assumption, another stereotype, and then watch as that preconception is obliterated as the character develops. It is a credit to the deftly written script, tight direction and exceptional acting talent that every one of these many characters is fully realized on screen without ever feeling one-dimensional.

Again, when the locksmith goes to fix the door of senator's house, the wife of senator yells him and wants him to change the locks following morning because she thinks the locksmith copy the keys and will sell them to the gangsters.

When it comes to details; personally I evaluate this movie considering its purpose and how it is useful for those who watching it. After people watch the film, which point the viewers will consider and want to change in their life I mean.

Furthermore, there are people in different races and belief in the movie both good and bad ones. Some of them have racial prejudice against people who are from other ethnicities. Because of this attitudes, people always hurt each other both emotional and physically; however, Paul Haggis manages to show us that there is not any kind of differences between people according to their appearance, wealth or nationality.In my opinion, the turning point of the movie is the scene that the officer John Ryan survived the black woman whom he groped the day before. At that scene, John Ryen regrets the thing he had done. Furthermore, each person in the movie who has racial judgment starts to regret their actions and comprehends that the racism only hurts people and drives a wedge between people.To sum up, the movie helps us to comprehend that we should put our prejudices and racial attitudes away.

This movie intertwines the lives of many unrelated people living together in the city of Los Angeles, California. It all takes place within a 36 hour time period. It focuses on the social and racial tensions that people face every day and it uncovers the negative truths of our shared humanity.<br/><br/>The cast of Crash is plentiful with big Hollywood stars:<br/><br/> A Brentwood housewife and her DA husband: Sandra Bullock as Jean and Brendan Fraser as Rick  Two police detectives who are also lovers: Don Cheadle as Graham and Jennifer Esposito as Ria  An African-American television director and his wife: Terrence Howard as Cameron and Thandie Newton as Christine  A Mexican locksmith: Michael Pena as Daniel  Two car-jackers: Chris ""ludacris"" Bridges as Anthony and Larenz Tate as Peter  A hardened cop partnered with a rookie cop: Matt Dillon as Officer Ryan and Ryan Phillippe as Officer Hansen<br/><br/>Life moves fast and this is something that all viewers can relate to. As citizens, we are often walking around in our 'own little worlds.' The theme of this film is to take a look at all the different walks of life and it allows us to see things from all points of view, not just our own. Our actions cause reactions. Too often people do not stop to think about how their proceedings will affect others. This film takes things to the extreme and it shows us the consequences that may result.<br/><br/>A tag line for this film is: We crash into each other just so that we can feel something. This is in relation to the fact that we are somewhat robotic in our daily lives. We have to work, some individuals even have to pick up second jobs, many of us are parents, and some of us are still furthering our educations. The hustle and bustle of daily life can cause us to slowly build resentments we are not even aware of. In addition to the theme of how we can affect others; there is also a piece of this film that shows how many of us are brought to our breaking points.<br/><br/>In some ways this movie did show similarities to the movie American History X. Crash is much broader. However, both of these films address the 'elephant in the room.' They cover topics that people do not like to talk about, but topics that are very real. They are both racially related. They both teach some sort of life lesson and show us things that truly make life meaningful: Love, family, the power of relationships, and respect for others.<br/><br/>There is phenomenal technique within the editing of this film. They weave together the lives of strangers and the transitions are extremely smooth. It can be hard when jumping from one unrelated scene to another and I give the editor of this film a lot of credit. Many of the scenes were filmed multi-camera. There was quite a bit of rearranging that had to be done and I found the editing to be flawless.<br/><br/>The sound effects and soundtrack are also very important elements used in this film. The end of this movie is quite a long 'aha moment.' The events all come full circle and everything that had been unpredictable throughout the film now makes perfect sense. Sounds help to heighten the intense moments in film. They have done an outstanding job here.<br/><br/>In summary, we live in a society where we must behave in a politically correct manner. But at the end of the day, we all see the world from our own perspectives. This is the reality. I found this film to be very real. As a viewer, I can really appreciate this. These are necessary issues to uncover. I feel as though these discoveries can only help us to become better people and better members of society. If I could, I would mail a copy to every household in the United States! This is a great film. I cannot say enough good things about it."

","In the film ""Crash"", that is written and directed by Paul Haggis, several characters' lives crash into each other as they are dealing with racial tensions in LA. The long list of characters includes a white district attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) whose car is stolen by two black men Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Peter Waters (Larenz Tate), a black TV producer Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine Thayer (Thandie Newton) who are pulled over by two white cops Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Officer Hansen (Ryan Phillippe) of which one is racist and inappropriately frisks the wife, a Hispanic locksmith Daniel (Michael Pena) and family, a Persian store owner Farhad (Shaun Toub) and his family, a Chinese couple Choi (Greg Joung Paik) and Kim Lee (Alexis Rhee), and black detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his Hispanic female partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito). Their lives become intertwined through car accidents, vandalism, and shootings and their attitudes toward each other change throughout these events.<br/><br/>The major of theme of racism is really blatant and in your face throughout the movie. I found this to be a bit unrealistic. It's not that I don't think there are that many racist people, but the way in which their stories are all connected takes away from the realism. However, as much as it was unrealistic, I didn't mind because of the ride that that the film takes you on. Some characters use race to have power over other people, and other characters seem to learn from the mistakes they have made regarding another's race.<br/><br/>The style of the film is amazing and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. With each scene, I was curious how it was going to bring us back to the beginning of the film. Its style is a reminder of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Magnolia"" which also includes a large cast of characters that are interwoven together. It's a complex style, but the theme is simple so it is easy to follow. I would recommend this film for the ride it takes you on and the discussions it will lead to in the end. The film highlights a serious problem in our world, even if it is portrayed a bit over the top."

","This film focuses on a widely diverse group of people who seemingly have nothing to do with one another. Brought together by issues of racism and violence, their stories intertwine in the end showing how everyone's lives intersect somehow.<br/><br/>Starring Sandra Bullock, Brenden Fraser, Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle just to name a few, this award winning film gives the audience a brief look into the lives of a group of people who learn many different lessons on life. The major theme of the movie is clearly defined as racism. All of the characters in one way or another face some form of racism and all handle it in their own way. The secondary theme of the movie is violence; however the two go hand in hand. The racism is based on violence and the violence is based on racism.<br/><br/>The two major film techniques used in this movie to give it dramatic effect are camera angle and editing. Every scene in the movie is short, seemingly unorganized, a few moments of each storyline. The camera angles are important because they show the important aspects of every scene. They don't focus so much on the action but rather the human reaction and emotions of each character. In the end the unorganized scenes start intersecting and the audience sees the other characters in different story lines. This technique brought the film together in a way that helps you understand that everyone is connected be it personally or emotionally."
"holton04","6","0","3","18 March 2012"," A movie that shows the unfortunate cruelty among the world and the harmful results that come from it
","Crash is a movie directed by Paul Haggis about a handful of different characters all with a similar struggle that connects them to one another. The movie jumps from one story to another, not tying in how they are all connected until the end. Each character in the movie faces the issue of how to not only live among, but treat different racial and ethnic groups. Ryan Phillippe plays Officer Tom Hansen who attempts to fight the racial separation in the city of Los Angeles and more specifically his partner Officer John Ryan, played by Matt Dillon. Don Cheadle plays Det. Graham Waters, Terrence Howard plays Cameron Thayer, and Sandra Bullock plays Jean Cabbot. The acting is well done in the movie, Crash. The viewer is left feeling an emotional tie to each character. Whether the viewer is feeling hatred, hurt, or sorrow, each actor is able to tap into the emotions of the viewers. This movie is similar to Gran Torino. Both have themes that deal with the fight of racism and prejudice. In both movies, the characters don't know how to deal with the characters of other races. Then, as the movie goes, the characters come to realize that their race and heritage don't define them as people. The movie, Crash, uses different camera angles to intensify the film. The camera zooms in on character's reactions and certain important scenes. During intense action scenes the camera angle is farther away to give the audience a clear view. Then, when the characters are reacting to the recent occurrence, hurtful slur, or sad scene, the camera zooms in close. Also, the lighting is important. Some scenes are dark and relate to the dark attitudes the characters have towards one another. Many scenes are set during the night. The surrounding is dark, but the characters features are lit up to intensify their reactions and feelings. The lighting makes the viewer feel the darkness of the theme. The movie is all about the struggle of the different cultures living together in peace. It shows the hardships some of the characters face because of their race, religion, or heritage. Crash gives a brutally honest idea of how cruel people can be to one another. The ignorance and lack or compassion the different groups of people have towards one another in this movie is a big theme. This leads some characters to be cruel and hurt others. The movie proves time and time again that the stereotypes and ideas one group has towards another is generally wrong. Without the terrible assumptions and hurtful behavior the characters have towards one another, all of the accidents and tragedies could be avoided."

","The movie Crash, directed by Paul Haggis, centers around several individual lives and their imminent fate that leads them to cross each other's paths in a web of racism and violence. This film features well known actress Sandra Bullock and A list actors such as Terrance Howard and Matt Dillon. Bullock plays Jean Cabot, wife of the District Attorney, who is carjacked by two black men which fuels her racist attitude. Dillon is a racist LAPD Officer John Ryan that acts inappropriately towards a black couple, Cameron Thayer (Terrance Howard) and his wife. The intertwining events come full circle when a car crash occurs and Thayer's wife's life is at risk. <br/><br/>The strongest and most prevalent theme is racism. Almost all the characters have strong feelings of disrespect and dislike towards someone of another race. The main players include Officer Ryan, Jean Cabot, and the Thayer couple. However, lesser characters also allow racism to be an underlying tone. This includes an Iraqi store owner distrusting of a Hispanic locksmith and a cop duo comprised of an African-American male and a Hispanic female. The language and actions of the characters clearly demonstrate their attitudes toward others unlike themselves. Until the end of the film, the racism is unrelenting. There are other films that share a similar theme which includes Babel, directed by Alejandro Gonzalez. The characters in this movie are also victims of fate and unfortunate circumstances. <br/><br/>Some of the techniques in this film include the camera angles and lighting. The issue of race is general a dark theme. Most of the scenes throughout this film are also dark. The carjacking occurs at night in the darkness as opposed to in the daytime, which illustrates the severity of the incident. While the camera angles are varied, there are several scenes with long intense lingers on the character's face. This moment allows the viewer to get in touch with that character's feelings of angst, disgust or hurt. <br/><br/>Overall, the film touches all of the areas surrounding race from different cultures. The fact that this movie occurs within a short time period and in the same city, further points out what many of us come into contact with each day. Although at times the content may be offensive and may make the viewer cringe, it is very poignant."

","Crash confronts the racism that is within all of us, whether we admit it or not. It begins with Asian women screaming racial insults at each other at a traffic incident. Next up is Middle Eastern people in an argument at which a man buys a gun. The third scene is a car jacking of a white district attorney an his wife by two black men. The d.a.' s wife is later having the locks changed in their house when she makes racist remarks about the Latino locksmith. A pair of white police officers pull over a black husband and wife and frisk them aggressively, even to the point of sexual harassment of the wife. More examples of racial prejudice continue to a shattering conclusion. Paul Haggis does a good directing job with a fine ensemble cast."

"starzATnite","9","0","4","2 February 2012"," Makes a great statement
","Paul Haggis weaves a spellbinding tale of sadness and disrespect for people who don't know each other. Cultural differences and fear drive snooty Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) to demand her door locks be changed again in the morning as the Hispanic locksmith works within earshot on the Cabot's last door. The protective shell around Jean Cabot is her mansion of a home. Even her pretend friends don't come to her rescue. Six intertwined stories take place in Los Angeles, CA. involving police officers who become hardened (Matt Dillon), Persian store owners, a black detective struggling to keep his family together, an upper class, black movie director, and a pair of thugs who seem to be on the edge of knowing right from wrong. Excellent cinematography and suspense keep the film moving forward. Camera angles help separate the stories by pointing way up in the sky, or shooting down from a very high point. Costumes and vehicles make the characters very believable. The director's wife, Christine (Thandie Newton) is always seen in designer clothes and high heels. She seems to have a shell around her keeping her from really bonding with anyone, but trying to get closer to her husband. The actor (Ryan Phillippe) who plays office Tom Hansen, seems genuinely concerned about people. The shell around officer Hansen keeps him from bonding with other officers. As the new guy he still wants to give people a chance before pouncing on them like his partner does. Nice guy locksmith, Daniel (Michael Pena) gives his protective shell to his daughter who is afraid of bullets. The timing and editing in this movie is very different from any other movie I have seen. After seeing this movie and the outstanding performances of actors like Don Cheadle and Thandie Newton, you can't help but ask yourself what the world would be like if people would just deal with circumstances, help each other out, and completely disregard skin color."

","You can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. The acting is extraordinary, the topic and plot realistic and gut wrenching. This movie is not just about racism, but more about people making choices based on limited information and knowledge. They judge others before they've walked a mile in their shoes. The show is also one that envisions negative actions as having negative results, that is you reap what you sew or to put it another way, life is a circle and things come back around to bite or reward you. Further to this, one of the most profound lessons to learn from this movie is that we humans are a mixture of villain and hero. We have the ability to choose which we're going to be at any moment. Not many movies being made these days make any dent in our self indulged semi-conscious lives, but this show does. It makes you think and demands your full attention. Don't watch it with someone who never shuts up or has the mental capacity of an Amoeba. This is a movie to share and to discuss long after it's over."

","The movie Crash is a story about human relationships and how the lives of several people cross paths during the period of 24 hours. From the start, we have preconceived notions as to how people will react in certain situations and this holds true for a little while. However, with just one word, one action, situations are turned around and characters grow. Although some characters in the story change for the better, others' lives are forever scarred. This movie contains racism, stereotypes, and prejudice that we can relate to in our own lives.<br/><br/>Some of the characters in this movie include Brendan Fraser as Rick Cabot and Sandra Bullock as Jean Cabot, a white District Attorney and his wife; Don Cheadle as Detective Waters, a black detective whose brother is missing and whose mother is addicted to drugs; and Matt Dillon as Officer Ryan, a racist white police officer taking care of his sick father. Additional notable characters include two young black thieves, Ludicrous as Anthony and Larenz Tate as Peter Waters; a Latino man, Michael Pena as Daniel; an Iranian shop owner, Shaun Toub as Farhad; and a wealthy black TV producer and his wife, Terrence Howard as Cameron and Thandie Newton as Christine. There are several other characters who make an appearance during the course of this film.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the present but flashes back 24 hours in an attempt to bring us to the emotional state of the present. Like Richard Curtis' Love Actually, throughout the movie we jump from story to story and then back again, sometimes overlapping each other. This is done so we can watch the changes taking place within the characters as they ""crash"" into and relate to each other. In addition, the sounds of several crashes and gun shots as well as the use of black screens are utilized to invoke suspense and fear from the audience. As the film is viewed, the audience is pulled into all of the feelings the characters portray including rage, anger, fear, relief, sadness, and grief.<br/><br/>All of us have had to relate to at least some of the issues employed in this film. Whether it is dealing with someone who is angry, being involved in an accident, or being the victim of a crime, we get to follow the characters in this film as they move through and deal with their emotions. Each character is changed by the end of the film. Some characters find the biggest problem within themselves, others learn that there are just some things they cannot change, while yet others have a little help from others to help them see the light."
"mcclar02","10","0","3","10 December 2011"," This movie displayed true concepts in every day life that not everyone is willing to accept
","The movie Crash involves several stories that are interwoven and connected within a thirty six hour period, without the characters in the story line being unaware of how their actions and beliefs affect the other person or other people. The theme of this movie show how people of all races and classes are interconnected by their attitudes and beliefs that affect each other in a profound and life changing way; from racists attitudes and beliefs from their own personnel experiences in life to how they got where they are in life and why. The main character Detective Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) is an African American Detective with the Los Angeles Police Department, his girlfriend Ria is a Latino Police Detective (Jennifer Esposito). His mother (Beverly Todd) is a drug addicted woman who's only concern is her youngest son, Peter. Peter is constantly in trouble with the law and Detective Walters is constantly trying to help his mother and brother Peter to clean up their lives. Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) is the wife of a D.A. Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser) who is too busy trying to get re-elected than to worry about the problems his wife is dealing with after getting car jack by two African American Males, Anthony and Peter. Jean deals with her racist attitudes and thoughts. Her husband is trying to bribe Detective Waters in order for the election to go in his favor. Anthony and Peter are always talking about racist's attitudes and the mindset of society as they continue their crime spree throughout the movie. Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) an African American Director and his wife Christine Thayer (Thandie Newton) are pulled over and harassed by a racist cop, Officer John Ryan (Matt Dillion) and his new partner, Officer Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe). Officer Ryan is dealing with his own personal problems with his ill father and his lack of adequate insurance coverage. Officer Tom Hansen is new to the police force and doesn't like the way Officer Ryan deals with people of other races, he wants to do the right thing but not sure how to make a stand. Officer Ryan does not believe he is racist and tries to help others, but ultimately proves his reactions to a situation that he is a product of the environment he is in; as we all are. Then the Persian immigrant store owner Farhad (Shaun Taub) and his daughter Dari. He buys a gun for protection of his store. He believes the Mexican lock smith did not fix his locks the way he should have. Farhad's daughter picks up a box of shells that are blanks because she is trying to control her father's irrational and racist behavior. The Mexican lock smith and his daughter who is afraid of the crime and violence that goes on around her. Her father tries to work hard and protect his daughter despite the racial prejudice he experiences We are all victims of our own beliefs, by what we have experienced in life or been taught. Crash combines many prejudice and racist thoughts and beliefs by its characters reactions to each other as they interact with life events. The climatic ending which starts at the beginning of the movie shows how we are all running through life with the ability to crash into each other but are able to put are hateful thoughts and feelings aside in the face of tragedy and human need."

","I believe crash was an outstanding movie. It was an eye opener that racism and predudice still exist in the cold world we live in. I thought it was brilliant the way the characters all intertwined together. Of course there were parts I didn't like especially when the cop (Ryan) worked so hard to stand for what he believed in and tried to get a new partner,helped the film director when he pulled over, and when he picked up one of the car jackers that was actually a decent guy. It was sad to see him shoot the car jacker due to what his partner put in his head, it made him think of the worst posibilites. I loved how the cop rescued the women he sexually herassed, when the father didn't get shot right in front of his own home, and when the other car jacker let all of the illegal immagrants go despite all the money he could have gotten for them. This movie demonstrates that with good comes evil, and with the bad, comes with the good. It was clever how you got to see the characters and how they were related to one another in some way. It was an amazing movie and I recommend it to whoever understands the world we live in today. We are all in this world for a short period of time, so make it count, and make a positive difference, never let the color of your skin, your nationality, or religion ever disuade you to become the person you want to be."

The choice of actors and actresses for each part couldn't of been better, with such performers like Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Ludicrous, etc. Everyone fit their part so perfectly and did a wonderful part putting themselves into character. Some of the scenes in this movie a viewer will not forget or be shocked like the incident when the woman gets pulled over by the cop and he is frisking her in a very inappropriate way. In that scene the cop takes advantage of her, knowing the husband can't do anything about it without getting in trouble because he is a cop. That's a big scene, and how the beginning of the movie is foreshadowing. It's a great film. All in all."

","This film is definitely one that can help people view the way that racism really takes place. I don't believe that most take racism and stereo typing as serious as it really is. In this movie, it is about a couple of characters who go about their daily lives, having to deal with being harassed, blamed, or criticized all because of their skin color or where they come from. It is viewed by all different point of views, showing how each and every one of them are racist in some way. From the cop harassing the black couple (woman), the two black kids stealing cars because of the way people view them, and to the way Sandra Bullocks character just automatically assumes that they key lock smith man will give their key away. All in all, it shows how racism takes place in all different ways. I firmly believe that by watching this film it will touch your heart in some way.

Although there are many other movies that portray the same image I think this one does it best. The movie is about 8 characters lives and how they encounter the reality of racism and how tough it can be to live with it around you. At some point all their lives become connected in one way or another which I thought was really cool. It is a very emotional movie sometimes not for the faint of heart. But ultimately it gets my approval and I think it could change the views of many other people."
"moses06","Null","0","2","20 September 2011"," Great movie which revolves around deep rooted conscious thinking about racism, and cultural prejudice
","Crash is a thought provoking movie based on a simple premise of following eight characters that represent people from all walks of life. Screenwriter and director Paul Haggis drama revolves around the racial tension and gender stereotypes of a group of strangers in Los Angeles. that is strung out on drugs, and a young thieving brother. Grahams partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) is also his girlfriend. Jean(Sandra Bullock), the wife of Rick( Brendan Fraser) who is a district attorney in L.A., is highly uncomfortable around anyone unlike herself, and as proof of her personal conviction, her SUV was stolen by two African Americans-Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter(Larenz Tate). Christine, (Thandie Newton) the beautiful wife of Cameron(Terrence Howard), a well to do television producer are pulled over by police officer Ryan (Matt Dillion) who interrogates the couple and sexually harasses Christine while husband Cameron watches on. Cast members Loretts Devine, Ryan Phillipe, and Larenz Tate all give a great performance. The theme of the Crash touches on the exploration of other issues such as racism, cultural prejudice and how people tend to look at others a particular way based on assumptions learned through life. The movie showed how we all live in our own comfortable bubbles, and sometimes we don't think about relating to those of different backgrounds, and socio economic statuses. A great example of another movie that has a similar theme can be seen in the movie Driving Mrs. Daisy. Hoke, played by Morgan Freeman is the chauffeur to a wealthy old Jewish woman, Daisy Werthan, played by Jessica Tandy. The way Miss Daisy treated Hoke as though she did not want him around and accused him of stealing from her shows her mindset towards those of a different socio economic class, and racial background. It wasn't until much later on in life that Daisy realized that Hoke was a true friend from the beginning. <br/><br/>In Crash there was a particular scene where scene where Officer Ryan was called to an accident an had to help Christine out of an over turned navigator. The angle in which the scene was shown was upside down from Christine's point of view. The cameras angle and perspective the viewer was able to get a feel for what was happening psychologically to Christine. As the camera moved back and forth in angle, it was easy to see that Christine was clearly in a distraught state, and initially refused Ryan's help. Officer Ryan's previous meeting of Christine came when he pulled her over and sexually harassed her after he verbalized his dislike of her being in the car with a Black man to his partner. Christine's obvious dislike of Ryan is stemming from that previous incident. This type of racism and dislike was prevalent throughout. The lighting is allows used very creatively throughout the movie. The incident when Officer Randy pulled over a Christine and Cameron was done in the evening. The lighting was adjusted so that the audience could see the details of what was going on in the scene clearly, but dark enough to portray the mystery of the event taking place. In the beginning everyone lives in their own bubble and tend to look at those outside of their bubble as alien. Not realizing that we all are the same seems to be the major expulsion throughout the picture. Realizing to be careful how you treat others, because you never know when you are going to meet or need that person in the future. Crash uses racism and cultural prejudice in combination with synergistic fate as a way to draw and keep the audience attention, and what a great good they did."
"fergus35","Null","0","3","16 September 2011"," Crash. I loved this film!
","Crash (2004). What an appropriate title for this movie. I loved watching this film. The storyline, character interactions, editing and direction were ingenious. I wanted to write a review without giving too much of the movie away, but found that hard to do once you start diving into the different directions this film takes. So not to take away the enjoyment of someone reading this post before watching the movie, I decided to focus this review on the theme, style, and techniques that the director/editor utilized in the film. <br/><br/>The theme of this film is centered on the style and structure of the film. This film incorporates many different characters and story lines that take place over the span of one day. Because of how each character intertwines with one another, the film was shot in a unique way. It gives the viewer the perception that while one event is happening in the movie, another is event is taking place at the same time. <br/><br/>The film incorporates what the film industry calls form cuts. This type of technique is often used to transition one scene into another by matching a similar shaped object to another shape in the next scene. For example, in the movie you will notice when Dorri (Bahar Soomekh) leaves the gun shop after the altercation between her father, Farhad (Shaun Toub) and the owner, she pushes the door of the shop to open. The scene then immediately jumps to (jump cut) to Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate) pushing open a door of a restaurant to exit. The film incorporates more of these types of form cut transitions. <br/><br/>Another technique utilized quite effectively was the musical score to emphasize important scenes. One scene that the director/editor used to heighten the emotional mood of the film was the scene with Officer Ryan (Matt Dillon) and Christine (Thandie Newton). Both of these actors did a superb job in their roles. Officer Ryan is a bigot cop who had an altercation with Christine the night before by improperly performing a search on her. Ironically, it is Officer Ryan that comes to Christine's aid and saves her life from a car crash. The music in this scene is very powerful. There are very few lyrics, and the ones sung are not in English. The actions of the characters, facial expressions and the body language of the characters, helps heighten the score. There are number of things going on in this segment of the film and the music gives the viewer the sense that something is about to happen, and the film delivers on this buildup. <br/><br/>Crash is a great film and makes you think about all the stereotypes that we have perceived in our mind. A really good line from Officer Ryan was that you think you know who you are, but that you really have no clue."" When looking at movie themes, it is sometimes determined if a movie has a universal interest. I definitely feel that Crash fits this evaluation because of the movie topics on prejudice, stereotypes, relationship conflicts, and human trafficking. All of these things are still issues all over different parts of the world today.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this film. If you saw the film Traffic (2000) by Steven Sodenbergh, than you will enjoy Crash. They both are shot in similar ways by intersecting multiple story lines and characters together. Officer Ryan's comment that I spoke on earlier also applies to Traffic. While watching this film you will begin to see people's character change, some for the good and some for the bad. Check out the movie and have fun watching for the form cuts and dramatic musical score that I discussed. Enjoy!"

","Crash Crash is a film exploring a multiracial cast and the lives they lead facing hatred and racism. Produced in 2004 and directed by Paul Haggis. This film has actress Julia Roberts playing Jean Cabot, Brenden Fraser playing Rick Cabot, and Matt Dillon as John Ryan. This movie demonstrates lives colliding and how we can all play an indirect role with each other.<br/><br/>This film reminds us that we should look at life with an open mind and not judge people by the color of their skin or where they came from. We may have preconceived notions about other races but we should treat everyone as their own and not judge an entire race from one person.<br/><br/>Jean Cabot demonstrates what racism is all about. She saw two black men walking in a nice neighborhood and immediately grabbed onto her husband. After the two black men realized what she thought, they high jacked the car that they were driving after holding them at gunpoint. When Jean arrived at her home the locks were being changed by a Mexican. By now she didn't trust anyone that wasn't white, so she loudly accused the Mexican of being a con artist and wanted the locks changed again. The Mexican heard her and left without saying a thing.<br/><br/>Another scene was when Officer John Ryan was trying to rescue a lady from a crashed vehicle. He had formerly threatened and molested her in front of her husband only because she was black. Officer Ryan thought he could do anything to anyone. Later after he realized he was rescuing her he felt remorse. He realized how uncomfortable he made that woman feel. All he knew is that he wouldn't give up on her now and wanted to earn her trust back. He rescued her and she was grateful for it. She hung onto him after he pulled her from the car and that showed that people are capable of getting over their differences.<br/><br/>After watching this film, you realize times don't change much. Even movies that are set in the present date still face racism. The Cider House Rules was another film that also contained racism and preconceived notions about black people. Although, it eventually came to a point where you just have to forget about the color of someone's skin and coexist with them because there isn't a real problem.<br/><br/>The movie was a constant reminder of people and their true feelings. When they pulled the camera in close you could really start to relate to these characters. Again, the scene where the officer was pulling the woman out of the car, was very well shot. You viewed the scene from within the car and it gave you a sense of what it was really like. It was dark, leaking gasoline, and you could see flames on the other car. When they pulled the officer out at first and left the woman, it showed his struggle and how he wanted to go back. That was one of my favorite scenes in the whole movie.<br/><br/>By watching this film a viewer should be reminded that no matter what color your skin is, you shouldn't judge someone else by an entire race of people. Don't let one person screw up your thought process for a whole race. Even though our world is crazy we must remember to not make it worse by feeding into hatred and racism."
"gomez09","Null","0","2","1 August 2011"," The Domino Effect
","The film Crash (2004) is centered on a belief expressed by a detective (Don Cheadle) at the scene of investigation early on in the film. His idea is one that revolves around the notion that people, or strangers, used to touch and feel close to one another in the past. The detective expressed that as time and city life evolved the closeness that people once experienced and enjoyed had strayed away or had become forgotten. He continued by stating that this feeling is missed so much amongst the populace that these people will sometimes go to the extreme measures of crashing into one another just to experience it once again.<br/><br/>The film then flashes back to the day prior telling multiple stories that intertwine and lead to the scene that is being investigated by the detective. Differences in race, societal hierarchy, and privilege lead and guide the actions of these characters. Regardless of their actions or crashes into one another's lives, the characters progressively shape the story and ultimately play a key role in what happens in the end. This movie was a prime depiction of great editing. This film consists of telling many different stories which ultimately draw a connection into one another. Editing efforts ensure that viewers' ideas, links, and reactions are influenced and guided in a way that makes the film credible and logical. In the film there were many instances in which sound effects were used to contribute to the realism of the action in the film and the emotion actors were experiencing at particular times. One scene, involving a potentially fatal car fire, included sound effects which built upon the suspense of the scene. Translating emotion from the silver-screen to viewers came in the form of a repeated and melodramatic melody. The filmmaker made this continuously used the same melody which familiarized viewers and cued them to digest the actor's emotion. This film is about the influence, both directly and indirectly, we as humans have on the lives and people within our society; our individual beliefs, values, and actions impact those around us."

","Crash deals with several real life stories that impact several characters in Los Angeles, California. Some main actors are Don Cheadle who plays Det. Waters, Matt Dillon who plays Officer Ryan, and Sandra Bullock who plays Jean Cabot. Racism and stereotypes are the major themes in Crash. These themes contributed to the film by showing how different races deal with each other in negative ways.<br/><br/>The storyline in Crash portrays a diversed group of people interacting in day to day activities that connect them together. Crash deals with how ethnic stereotypes are thriving in the minds and thoughts of people.<br/><br/>In one scene, two black teenagers are approaching Rick and Jean Cabot who are walking down the street. Jean notices them and immediately gets anxious or nervous. Although, they did carjack them, the point is that she was already afraid of them before they attacked them which shows how some white people are afraid of some black people.<br/><br/>In another scene, Officer Hanson gives Peter a ride in his car. During their conversation, Peter notices that Officer Hanson has the same figurine that he has. When he reaches in his pocket to show him, Officer Hanson panics, shots him and dumps his body in a field. This scene shows the fear that white people have regarding black people.<br/><br/>Gran Torino has a racism theme, as well. This movie stars Clint Eastwood as Walt who is very racist. He is upset that his neighborhood is becoming more integrated with Hmongs. This film shows how racism can deeply impact people in a negative manner. But, what is most enjoyable is seeing Walt demonstrate that people can change and become a positive factor in the lives of the people that he misunderstood early on.<br/><br/>The color and lighting was very realistic in Crash. During the daylight and evening scenes, everything looked very natural and had accurate lighting. For example, when Christine was in a car crash, the camera captured realistic lighting of the scene and the explosion.<br/><br/>Also, the angles really captured the expressions and demeanor of the actors. For example, in the main crash scene when Christine was stuck in her car, the angle of the camera captures the accident scene from each vantage point. This allows a realistic feeling that involves fear and anticipation, at the same time.<br/><br/>This film was accurate portrayal of how different groups of people feel about each other. However, their differences didn't keep them from crashing together in this dramatic film about racism and stereotypes. This film exposes the fears and prejudices that are engraved in our society and cultures. Some characters seemed to change the way they felt about other races as the films goes along, however, others still never changed their viewpoint."

","THE STORY: Peoples of differing ethnicities and social-economic levels 'crash' into each other in Los Angeles over a two-day period.

For one thing, ""Crash"" is even more serious and dark. <br/><br/>As you can see above, this is a very involved story with numerous interwoven story lines; it ain't no mindless popcorn 'blockbuster.' A casual viewing won't cut it. It's not that type of picture. Most of the negative criticisms about the film are by people who didn't watch closely and then lambaste the film with criticisms that aren't even legitimate.<br/><br/>For one thing, the film is about so much more than racism; it also addresses stereotypes, hypocrites, the capacity for good and bad in every human soul, second chances, passive correction and shame, self-sacrifice, redemption, forgiveness, abuse of power, the last straw, manhood & emasculation, giving someone a break, true friendship, misunderstandings, favoritism and more. <br/><br/>*** SPOILER ALERT *** <br/><br/>Furthermore, not every character is racist as some critics insist. Brendan Fraser's character never shows any racism and the only reason his wife (Bullock) blows up with racially-charged statements concerning the locksmith is because she just got robbed and shoved to the pavement at gunpoint by two young black guys. How would you or I react after such an experience? Also, Matt Dillon's cop partner never displays racism in the truest sense; why else would he radically come to the defense of the director who has a fit or pick up a young black male hitchhiking? (What happens later is a misunderstanding not real racism). What about the detectives Graham and Ria and Ria's housemaid mother? (Yes, Graham makes one derogatory statement about Hispanics, but that's it; he's hardly racist). These are all main characters. <br/><br/>Then there's the criticism that all the protagonists are ""essentially one-dimensional racial stereotypes."" This is completely untrue. Graham and Ria (black and Hispanic) are successful detectives; Cameron is a successful black TV director; and the Hispanic locksmith is a family-oriented working man, not a criminal or gangbanger. Yes, there are some people who fit the stereotypes, like the two young black male thieves and the racist/abusive white cop, but one of the thieves becomes shamed for his lifestyle & hypocrisy and the racist cop is willing to risk his life for a woman of color, thus redeeming himself (from the guilt he felt over abusing his power the night before), besides his white partner is anything but a white racist who abuses his authority. I could go on but this is enough. <br/><br/>One critic criticized the film with this multiple-choice question: ""You are involved in a car accident on a busy street. The other driver is Asian. Do you: <br/><br/>a) Wait for the police to arrive and see if the other driver is okay. b) Exchange insurance information with the other driver. c) Scream and yell, ""damn chinks don't know how to drive!"" <br/><br/>""If you picked C, you'd love Crash."" <br/><br/>This car-crash scenario DOES take place in the story, but he's leaving out some important details -- A woman & man are rear-ended by an Asian lady. Why don't they call the cops? Because they ARE cops and there are other cops on the scene. Why does the lady detective talk back to the Asian woman? Because the Asian woman is having a fit and throwing racial slurs (she's Hispanic). This is WHY she talks back to the Asian woman, not to mention she's a cop and therefore in a position of authority. Why does the Asian woman have a fit anyway? Because she's rushing to the hospital to see if her husband's alive or not. So, you see, the witty little multiple-choice question doesn't actually fit the reality of the film. <br/><br/>*** END SPOILER *** <br/><br/>Another criticism is that the racism in the story is not subtle like it is in real life. Well, haven't you ever seen anyone blow up like in the movie? I have. In a city as big as L.A. how many such blow ups happen over any 48-hour period? <br/><br/>Yes, there's a lot of raw emotion and hard-to-watch scenes, but there are undeniable glimpses of love, hope, redemption and forgiveness as well. If you're in the mood for a well-made psychological drama with numerous insights to the human condition, don't miss out on ""Crash."""
"KnightsofNi11","7","0","2","13 May 2011"," Is it genius? Is it crap?
","Crash seems to be one of the most polarizing Best Picture winners ever. A quick browse through the IMDb forums will show you that some people view this film as an ingenious masterpiece while others despise it with every fiber of their body. I find myself somewhere in the middle of these two opposing sides. There's a lot of debate over what Crash is, what it all means, and what its true motivations are. So much of this film is subjective and can be looked at in a positive or a negative light so I'll just establish fact. Crash is a movie about an ensemble of people whose lives intertwine over the course of two days in Los Angeles. We have a racist white cop, a high society black couple, a Persian family that owns a pawn shop in downtown, a black hoodlum who preaches about racism and avoiding stereotypes all the while jacking cars, a Hispanic locksmith, and various others. Over these two days these people learn about themselves through dramatic encounters that all fuel a motif of racism and stereotyping. This movie certainly has masterpiece potential, and maybe thats why I am weary to solidify my opinion on this film at this point.<br/><br/>In theory Crash is amazing. The thought going into the story is intelligible and complex. It's a story about finding out who we are and what makes us human. It seeks to examine the effects of stereotyping and where this kind of human nature leads us and how it makes us feel. If you examine the film closely you find all of these things in many different ways, but the issue comes from what you have to dig through to discover this metaphoric treasure trove.<br/><br/>Virtually every character in this film is a racist. And some of the racism is just so forced and is crammed down your throat in such a rude and unsettling way that you start to lose sight of the magic potential this film was heading towards. There are just certain moments where, try as you might, you just can't buy into the fact that some people are actually like that. I'm not denying that racism exists because it does and it is a sad part of our everyday life, but I just don't believe it at this level of force fed cliché. Nearly every conversation in this film has to do with race and every bit of banter is racially motivated, so much so that it gets tiring and irritating to an extent.<br/><br/>Another place where I have some trouble connecting with this film is some of the characters. I said before, nearly every character in this film is racist and judgemental. The judgemental part goes back to the recurring themes of human nature but the racism is just too over the top for me to like any of these characters. Now I realized by the end of the film that the purpose of these unlikeable characters is that they are supposed to go through major revelations at the end of the film and learn who they are and where their own actions have led them. I know that at the end of the film they did all learn things, but I didn't feel like they learned anything. Obviously I saw it on screen. I saw Farhad part with his anger after almost killing a little girl. I saw Officer Ryan come to terms with himself and how his own bigotry was affecting his life. I saw Cameron realize who he was and that he still loved his wife in spite of everything. I saw all of these things, but I hardly felt any of them. There's a wall between me and the characters in this film that blocks all emotional connecting and this wall was built by the way in all these characters and their development were forcefully spoon fed to me.<br/><br/>But maybe Paul Haggis, director/writer of the film, is actually a genius for making Crash the way he did. Maybe he purposefully made the characters as blatant and cliché as he did to frustrate and confuse people. And once they are angry they vent these feelings of frustration and start to boast why the film is wrong and why they are above this kind of clichéd and predictable film. In doing so could they be proving Haggis' point about the people who think they are above racism and stereotypes? Are they just falling into another stereotype that Haggis actually addresses in Crash. We have the characters of Peter, Anthony's friend, and Officer Tom. These are the two characters who set themselves apart from all the racial tension and don't let it play a role in their lives. Of course, in the end, they are the most affected by it because of their own underlying stereotyping which they hadn't addressed in themselves until Tom shoots Peter. Are the haters of Crash just proving Haggis' point? This kind of meta filmmaking is a bit of a stretch, but one can never truly know, can they? I definitely have some issues with Crash, but it isn't necessarily a bad movie. However, its motives are too shrouded in subjective ambiguities for me to really connect with this film. I can see at least some of what it set out to accomplish, but the gray area is where much of the criticism, my own included, of this movie comes from. Of course as far as just pure filmmaking goes, Crash has a great cast and some powerful performances. Haggis' direction is also superb. Combined with the music it is even more powerful and dramatic and there are moments of this film where the visual quality is astounding and will not leave you. But when you take a long hard look at this film it is just really difficult to discern just what kind of a film Crash is."
"cuppa_tetleys","8","0","3","13 May 2011"," A brilliantly crafted message that the title doesn't even hint to.
","Crash reminds me of a drama piece I did for an exam - an ensemble of different characters and events that seem separate but are related in theme and statement. Every performance in this film is excellent; every part no matter how small has been carefully thought out and acted with skill. All writing, acting and directing are fantastic, and special praise for the editing and the structure of the piece which always keeps you engaged and keeps the pace at the correct tempo.<br/><br/>Any problems I had with the film were probably just ones of taste; in terms of an artistic work, Crash is essentially perfect. It deals with racism in so many different and intelligent ways that, combined with great acting, give us a real sense of reality. However in the first 20- 30 Min's I felt like I was being bashed over the head with the message: RACISM IS BAD, with every character talking about race and discrimination which seemed unnatural to me. But that was most likely just to make it really clear to the audience what was being dealt with, and the narrative and dialogue settle after a while to deliver some truly amazing stuff.<br/><br/>Another gripe I had with this was that, as with my drama piece, it was very difficult to become emotionally attached to any of the characters as just as you get focused on one guy, it jumps to the next and you don't see the same characters on screen for another half an hour. Again, this was intentional - this film is to make us think, not feel; to reflect on our own attitudes and question ourselves what we would do in the same position.<br/><br/>A truly brilliant artwork, but it is in no sense a standard film as it's purpose is to convey a message through its story. It reminds me somewhat of Requiem For a Dream, in a good way, but without the emotional impact as we can't really connect with the characters too well. I shed a few tears at one bit though. In summary, it does exactly what its meant to do and any faults that can be found are merely due to discrepancy of taste. <br/><br/>8/10."

","I have seen Crash three times now and each time its Robert Altman approach improves - the way the stories interweave, the fact that it is addressing rather than disguising race, and the way the story impacts remains powerful and effective.<br/><br/>Many of the negative reviewers seems to find it akin to soap opera or like a Lifetime movie; I disagree, though it does resort to some cliché in parts, the effect of the film rises above any simplistic notions of happy endings or trite messages, and tries to state and explore, nearly always with great success, the current state of race relations in the US.<br/><br/>Did Crash deserve its Oscar, is it the best film of the year? Perhaps not, but what it is, is a brave attempt through non-linear stories, to portray a very complex issue, in a way that has not been done often before in US cinema and for that reason alone its worth the award and worth viewing."

","This movie commendably portrays the reality of social relations in one of the biggest and most important cities of the world: Los Angeles. Interwoven into this tale are the stories of several inter-related characters who are all portrayed to live quite separate lives,but still somehow come across each other in the course of their daily lives.<br/><br/>To start with, this movie quite effectively portrays the vile manifestations of anti-Muslim and anti-Arab racism in the months following the 9/11 attacks, where a Persian store-owner suffers a break- in and then breaks down mentally. <br/><br/>Cops are portrayed nonchalantly as racist and potential racist enforcers. Particularly interesting is the case of the young Officer Hansen played by Ryan Phillippe who initially is prone to non-racist attitude, but is instructed by his senior one time partner, played superbly by Matt Dillon, regarding the ""realities"" of being a cop. Hansen eventually succumbs to racist prejudice.<br/><br/>The film also includes a few people of the non-upper classes: two black youths who are led into crime and portrays a kind of catharsis for one of them when he is forced to go against his ""principles"" in a car holdup. Then there is the touching portrayal of a South American immigrant and his family. There is also the reality of human trafficking which is quite explicitly shown.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie which brings out many uncomfortable truths, in the midst of which the real sufferings of humanity in the midst of the so-called ""City of Angels"" stands out."
"jklewis54","10","0","4","25 March 2011"," descent into relativism
","As an unfurled roll of 35mm film, ""Crash"" provides vignettes of disconnected, but intertwined, lives spiraling into individual discovery of the collective reality that surrounds them. Normally plying their lives within their individual frames, a number of people are forced to face personal fears, biases, and insecurities. The director skillfully brings what are totally disconnected relationships and the normal interaction of lives in the metropolis of Los Angeles into an examination of the realities of how closely those lives are connected – and can often collide.<br/><br/>Too many to detail each person here, the main characters are intensely involved in their occupations and seek to overcome personal issues in the midst of internal and external struggle that fuels the issues even further. The thread within the film is a karma-like interconnectedness of these lives. In ways they will never know, each interaction provokes outward reaching ripples in the pond of each of the lives depicted here, causing them to search internally for answers. It brings to mind the story of the angry man coming home to yell at his wife, who yells at the kids, who yell at the dog, who barks at the cat, who jumps on the man – clawing him.<br/><br/>In a culture once embedded with absolutes, ours is growing so relativistic that we are losing any point of reference for our actions. A quote that beautifully book-ended the film (along with the crash analogy) summed this succinctly: ""Graham, I think we got rear ended. I think we spun around twice, and somewhere in there, one of us lost our frame of reference. And I'm going to look for it."" It is apropos that, in that scene, the detective discovers that the brother he tried to protect by compromising his own ethics, is now dead. The sacrifice of his values was ultimately worthless . . . and saved no one – including himself. This is a great picture to use in a discussion with this culture that is rapidly descending into relativism; the losing of ones' values leaves us with nothing."
"kaseka01","9","0","4","20 March 2011"," Racial discrimination and its prejudice
","Crash (2004) is drama film produced, and directed by Paul Haggis. The film focuses on racial discrimination and its prejudice in California (Los Angeles). The movie relates several interwoven stories about different group of people and their dramatic scenarios: a black Hollywood TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton) who has to deal with a white racist officer John Ryan (Matt Dillon). John unsuccessfully try to get medical attention for his sick father from a black insurance representative staff Shanigua Johnson (Loretta Devine); a gang of two black teenager Peter Waters (Larenz Tale) and Anthony (Ludacris) carjacked, at gunpoint, the District Attorney Rick Cabot (Brandon Fraser) and his wife Jean (Sandra Bullock). Sandra takes out her anger on Daniel (Michael Pena), a Hispanic locksmith who is changing the door's locks to their house; an immigrant father who is discriminated by a shop's owner when he was buying a gun to protect his belonging. The movie theme refers to how racial conflict remains a subconscious matter that the mind can fail to control. The movie starts with Los Angeles detective, Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) who was investigating the crime scene where his partner and he were involved in a car accident. The accident and the crime were not connected. From there the film back up to the day before the incident. Throughout the movie, the sequence of events shifts between different characters; at the end of the film, characters switch from good to evil or vice-versa.<br/><br/>Officer John Ryan rescued Christine from her car accident. Before the incident, the same officer sexually molested her during a patrol. As opposed to his partner Tom Hansen who transferred to a one-man car to avoid his racist behavior, Tom ended up being involved in the murder of Graham Water's young brother (Peter). Jean changed her attitude towards her maid.. The camera angles in this movie were excellent; they make viewers feel as they are part of the action. Variety of sound is used from one scene to another to enhance the message the editor want the audience to get. From the opening scene to the final scene, the background music plays an important role. Haggis did a great job of telling the truth of how people can react when it came to racism. The use of music, sound links, dissolve transition, outside/in and inside out pattern, parallel cuts help to make Crash an excellent movie."

The film displays how a mixed culture communicates and reacts with disrespect and ignorance, and immediately resorts to using hatred and violence as a way of communicating with their fellow man. This lack of respect and understanding usually ends with disastrous results. The setting adds to the films element of suspense because of the intense racial interaction and hatred that LA is riddled with. Using LA as the setting offers just the right mix to make the film feel real and alive. Crash is a montage of many different cultural backgrounds that balances out to generate a feeling of realism of what each of these people deal with on a day-to-day basis. Haggis uses many different technique of flash back and a crisscross structure to relay the feeling of the family's frustrations, anger and fears of how to effectively communicate and trust other cultures. He is able to show how most of the people involved in the film are not racist but have become a product of their unfortunate environment. Haggis is able to expertly juggle the extreme emotional effect with a sense of realism that keeps the viewer totally involved. ""Crash"" is not an easy film to accept, it brings to light many racial situations that are not accepted in society. With a theme, that centers itself around communication between different cultures in it ugliest form. However, it is wonderful production of realism and issues that many would like to think do not exist. This movie is a definite must see. I encourage everyone to view this film with an open mind."

","Who said that the Oscars movies can't be independent and good quality? Crash is an example of that.<br/><br/>A single event in somebody's life can have repercussions in many others. That is the point of departure of this post-modern holistic view of human interrelations and of modern American multicultural multiracial society. A portrait of the always bleeding American society and of the depths of human spirit.<br/><br/>Crash is a choral film in which each main character mini-story links to the others in an organic way. Moreover, is not a movie with good and bad people and roles, as all characters are deeply human, therefore, both shown in all its splendor and misery - sometimes disgusting, reproachable, racist and violent, some others heroic, tender, kind and good. The story has action and introspection at the same time, and the main characters are wonderfully drawn and played by all actors.<br/><br/>The movie, moreover, offers a raw unadorned image of American society and social groups - a society full of anger, violence and fear. Nobody is free from it - Rich or poor, immigrant or native, leftist or fascist, victims or executioners. But, again, the characters are not good or bad, are good and bad depending on the circumstances.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that some of the developments of the story made made me question assumptions and prejudices about people. In fact racist people can show non racist behavior and vice versa. Some people preach anti- racism and them behave in a racist way. Heroes can be villains and vice versa.<br/><br/>The director did a great job at creating unity and giving harmonic pace and sense to the emotional physical and cultural chaos in which most characters live. The movie makes you think, but it is entertaining and approachable, emotional and thinkable.<br/><br/>A great movie that will stand the pass of time."
"dalton2","10","0","3","9 March 2011"," A depiction of selfishness and altruism, or the eternal fight between Good and Evil
","OK, this movie covers the issue of racism and also about the American society, but there's something deeper in here.<br/><br/>You can see both mechanisms of survival in the human being: the instinct of survival of the individual (egoism) and the instinct of survival of the species (altruism). They both are present in every human being, and they are ""transfered"" from one human being to another in a ""contagious"" manner. When somebody is under the control of selfishness, he is virtually a hero for himself, and a killer for everybody else. There you have Cameron, a non-violent Buddhist man whose life you get to find caught under selfishness, with no fear to be killed by a gun, maybe even wishing to be shot as a sign of compassion for himself, who's willing to stop his suffering after other people ""transfered"" so many negative emotions to him that now that instinct is taking his life under control. And you can find that apparently hateful policeman, John Ryan, who abused a woman in the first minutes of the movie, saving later her life after a car accident, in this case, under the control of altruism, and acting as a hero, not for him, but for that woman. It's the perpetual fight of Good and Evil, depicted in a precise and understandable way. The policeman's father has a painful disease, and he transfers all his anger to his son day after day, who feels each day a little more helpless about a former compassionate person he truly loves. When we get to know that fact, we suddenly see him under a completely different point of view. The movie seems to tell us, ""you see? it's just a matter of knowledge"", and we even understand his madness: as spectators, we don't catch his anger any more. Fear, anger, desire, attachment. You can see all negative emotions which, according to Buddhism, cause suffering to humans, which in turn makes our ego grow and veils our minds. Other movies, like Star Wars, show that ""force"", and also how easy it is to fall into ""the dark side"", but no movie showed before, without metaphors, and with so much detail, how human nature works.<br/><br/>Suddenly, in the middle of madness, a combination of coincidences makes a miracle happen: a gun doesn't kill a little girl. That's a drop of Good which turns upside down a whole ocean of Evil, and shows that altruism, illusion, positive emotions... Good, in a nutshell, is our way to go, and also the strongest tool for survival provided by nature.<br/><br/>And this latter ""miracle"", and other scenes in the movie, like the one where Jean Cabot is angry and doesn't know why, and one minute later falls down the stairway, make me see this movie even in a deeper way. The Celestine Prophecy comes to my mind, with not just instincts involved, but the universal energy (something like ""qi"" from Eastern philosophies) flowing among humans in the form of positive and negative energy, and a superior ego controlling each of our lives in every detail as a master puppeteer. Within this framework, that miracle wasn't just a coincidence: it was one part of a kaleidoscopic reality where universal energy forces coincidences to happen. In other words, the little girl, with her innocence and true love, made that possible through a change in what we know as reality. This concept is very close to Buddhist karma.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie can also be interpreted from a scientific point of view in the form of the theory postulated by Richard Dawkins in his book ""The Selfish Gene"".<br/><br/>In any case, it serves as a hard criticism of the actual selfishness present in the American capitalist society, ""preached"" by Ayn Rand in her bestseller books, which have got to be almost as popular as the Bible, a line of thought that is spreading from the USA together with psychoanalysis to other countries like France and Argentina as a cancer in society. There are older movies which cover this issue in a metaphorical or allegorical way. One of my favorite ones is Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), remade in 1978.<br/><br/>Crash is a great movie, worthy of the Oscars it got. Watch out, there are two movies with this name in 2004."

","Crash is directed by Paul Haggis. Crash has many large name actors/actresses such as Don Cheadle (Graham Walters), Matt Dillon (John Ryan), Sandra Bullock (Jean Cabot), Jennifer Esposito (Ria), Loretta Devine (Shaniqua Johnson), Ryan Phillipe (Tom Hansen), Larenz Tate (Peter Waters), Brendan Frasier (Rick Cabot), and Thandie Newton (Christine). <br/><br/>The entire film takes place in all of two days. Crash follows several people of different ethnicities. These characters include an African American director and his wife; a Middle East store owner and his daughter; two white police officers; an African American detective and his female Hispanic partner; a Latin locksmith and his young daughter; two African American teenage criminals; and a white district attorney and his wife. The film shows how these people experience racism and how they are also guilty of racism. All of these characters are connected by one ""crash.""<br/><br/>The district attorney and his wife experience a car-jacking (done by the two African American teens); then Jean is uncomfortable having a Latino locksmith change the locks in her home. The movie director and his wife get pulled over by two white cops; one of the white cops violates the wife and she gets angry at her husband for not standing up for her. The Latino locksmith is trying his best to raise his young daughter and provides her with a cloak to protect her from gunshots. This film shows raw racism. It is very real in that situations like these do occur on a daily basis even in today's society. Crash takes the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster. There are lots of negative attitudes depicted throughout the entire film. For example, Daniel (the Latino locksmith) changes the locks at the Middle Eastern man's store after it has been broken into. Daniel informs the store owner that he needs a new door but the owner refuses. He experiences another break-in and blames the locksmith. He goes to shoot Daniel and ""hits"" his daughter. It is then that the store owner discovers there were only blanks in the gun and thankfully the girl is okay.<br/><br/>Sound effects are important in this film. Silence is used in many of the crime and action scenes. Music also plays a vital role in giving the emotional effect. The variety of music played relates to the scene and conversations. Some music used includes: hip-hop, country, Middle East music, and Latin music. <br/><br/>Another film that exhibits racism is Gran Torino. However, in this film it shows one racist person (Walt). He is racist against everyone. Others in this film are accepting of Walt despite his racist ways.<br/><br/>Crash shows that everyone is different but yet we all have so much in common. It is tragic that racist situations still occur so frequently. This could easily be prevented if we all just look past our differences and see how alike we all really are."

The movie boldly addresses racial and social stereotypes—at times upholding them—but usually contradicting them. More importantly however, the film focuses on how as human beings we may have our differences, but we are much more alike than we are different.<br/><br/>Not since The Breakfast Club (Hughes, 1985) have I seen a film so thoroughly remove the prejudiced lens through which we view others.

","Crash, written and directed by Paul Haggis, is a story concentrating on 8 seemingly unrelated characters whose lives ""crash"" down over a fateful 24 hours. With a star-studded cast leading the way, the film takes a hard look at the external tensions and stereotypes of the people in greater Los Angeles, and contrasts them with the internal struggles of the dealing with life in cultural melting pot. Reminiscent of Magnolia (1999) or Traffic (2000), each individual character's story is shown, and then woven together through various incidents that might seem like a normal day on the streets of L.A.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Larenz Tate, and Terrence Howard lead a strong cast that give a deep introspective into the conflicts of life in L.A. Each main character has some stereotype, usually racial, that they are playing into, willingly or not. Dillon plays an angry LAPD officer that abuses his power, but at the same time shows a softer side while trying to take care of his sick father. Phillippe plays the opposite of Dillon, an officer who bucks the system and stands up for what he believes is right. He too is conflicted between his external values and the stereotypes of the world he lives in. This internal/external conflict is a constant theme between the other characters, from the upstanding district attorney's wife (Bullock) to the successful African American director (Howard) to the petty criminal (Tate). All of these conflicts come to a head in the 24 hours where their lives intersect. <br/><br/>Racial tensions play a key component in the story. The plot lines are controversial and attack real issues that affect our society head-on. The characters show the worst and the best of people, and take you on an emotional roller coaster as you learn more about them and what makes them who they are. <br/><br/>The subjective viewpoints throughout the film give the viewer the experience of living in these character's shoes. The cinematography and editing are top notch, and place the viewer within the correct frame of mind to understand the situation without being too obvious. The scenes, although seemingly disjointed and non-related, flow together into a wonderful series of stories. The strong soundtrack plays a huge part in this film, with subtle background music that highlights the seriousness of certain scenes, and the lack of any sound highlighting tense moments. <br/><br/>Crash brings good directing, writing, and acting together to tackle a difficult subject matter, and turns it into a great drama that tugs at emotions of the viewer throughout."

","The movie crash takes place in Los Angeles; this drama was written and produced by Paul Higgins. This movie is about racism, conflict and the ability to change. This movie was inspired by a real incident when Paul got his porch stolen. The characters in this film made many mistakes toward each other in which affected them in the end. The main characters of this film are Sandra Bullock as Jean, Matt Dillon as officer John Ryan, Ludicrous as Anthony, Brendan Frasier as Rick, and Thandie Newton as Christine. Each of these characters played a major role in this film.<br/><br/>Jean, an upper class, middle aged white women, was having dinner with her husband Rick. When they were heading to their car, they got car jacked by two black men (Anthony and Peter) by gun. When she returned home a Mexican was changing their locks and she insisted on them being changed again in the morning because ""He was going to sell them to his homies"" . Rick told her that she was over reacting and insisted she go to bed. Come to find out later, he was a family man and had no relations with any sort of gangs. After the carjacking she really started showing her racist tendencies. When she slips and falls down the stairs no one would answer the phone, she then realized that her only true friend was a minority.<br/><br/>Officer John Ryan works for the LAPD, he notices a car that looked like the one jacked previously. His partner informs him that the plates don't match but John notices two black people were driving and proceeds to pull them over. He makes them get out of the car and while searching the man's wife Christine he molests her. He gives the couple the option to apologize for their ""wrong doing"" or go for a ride in the police car. Christine's husband apologizes and Ryan sends them off with a warning.<br/><br/>Christine is very upset with her husband for humiliating her and they get into a fight. She tries to make amends with him and he just under minds her. After leaving upset she gets into a horrid accident where she was stuck in her seat belt and the car is leaking gas. The only officer on scene is John Ryan, Christine then makes the decision to let Chris touch her and cut off the seat belt in which he saves her live.<br/><br/>The way this film was shot kept everything flowing very well. It starts with each character as an individual and ends with how every individual affected one another by their actions. I have only really ever seen two racist movies, Crash and American History X. These films are related in many ways. I think these types of movies show how people can actually change their perspective on life but it usually involves life threatening acts. But it is always good to know that people can change for the better. I enjoyed watching these movies because of the emotional affect that it brings."

","The movie crash involves a collection of events that bring multicultural characters together during an unforeseen situation. Each character is a victim of their own cultural bias that keeps them from interacting with others. In the movie stereotypes are challenged, confirmed, and cross-examined by the characters point of view . The film involves many actors that are connected by a single crash. The main character includes:<br/><br/>Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) Matt Dillon (John Ryan ) Terrence Howard(Cameron Thayer) and Thandie Newton (Christine Thayer)<br/><br/>The theme is centered on racism and stereotypes. It explores how racial discrimination distorts our views and plays a vital role in the way we perceive and treat others. The irony in the film involves the characters no one knows who they will encounter in terms of tragedy and emotional anguish. Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock) is a wealthy house wife her life is forever changed when she is robbed by two black men. She is now intolerant of people of color. Personal prejudices are formed from experience; those of us who had a bad experience with another race tend to stereotype that particular race. Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) is a African American detective with the LAPD. His negative view of his own race caused him to distance himself. Matt Dillon (Ryan) is a racist veteran cop who pulls over an African American married couple Terrence Howard (Cameron Thayer) and Thandie Newton (Christine Thayer). During this routine traffic stop Officer Ryan takes pride in degrading Cameron and abusing his wife. Powerless Cameron watch in agony as his wife is being humiliated. This incident of indecency put a strain on their relationship causing friction between the two. <br/><br/>Crash is a film that provides insight into people attitudes and behaviors brought on by bigotry and stereotyping races. The characters in this film are noticeably recognizable by their stereotypical behavior. Because the film is conflict motivated characters are too quick to use offensive racial remarks without merit. The scene takes place in the racially disjointed city of LA. Every day people pass each other by as if others aren't visible. The lighting of the film is symbolic to the headlights of a car that blur the vision of passing cars. Crash suggests our view of each other is distorted. The motif relates to the actual crash as it detailed how apparently unconnected lives overlap in entirely unpredicted ways. If it wasn't for the car crash the characters wouldn't be inter connected and forced to put their personal prejudices and side to help one another. <br/><br/>One of the main characters Don Cheadle set the tone for the movie; he states ""We crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" This comment suggests that we are unaware of own being and must try to connect with those around us. Our opinions of other are guided by notion that we are superior. Racism is learned behaviors that can be overcome if we take the time understand and value other cultures."
"galown02","8","0","5","31 October 2010"," Good Movie. Worth Seeing.
","Crash takes you through a two day in the lives of multiple characters in a way which shows different stereotypical and racist views that each character has towards another. Their lives are intertwined in a way that makes each question and possibly change their viewpoint towards another ethnic group. The movie stars Don Cheadle (Detective Graham Waters), Matt Dillon (Officer John Ryan), Ryan Phillippe (Officer Tom Hansen), and Sandra Bullock (Jean Cabot). In each ""Crash"" moment a character learns something about themselves and how they would react in a given situation. The movie is set in the City of Los Angeles and places each character in situations that are familiar to the area. Because of the racial tensions that have taken place in the Los Angeles area, it is a perfect setting for a movie that deals with stereotypes and racial diversity. The movie places each character into a racially driven predicament, and allows you to see how each responds. The setting of Los Angeles allows this to be believable due to the diversity of the area and allows the viewer to have an understanding of what life is like in the city. The lighting and filming techniques of Crash put the viewer into what the situation would be like if you were in it yourself. The director utilizes natural lighting to put you right into the view that the person in the scene they were really faced with that dilemma. The use of subjective and objective filming techniques helps to paint a picture for the viewer. In the objectively filmed scenes, you are allowed to see the environment and put it into its proper context. As you are thrown into the subjective view, you get the feeling of the drama that the character is experiencing and thus are given a rush of emotion that makes you, the viewer; feel as though you are in the scene. Like American History X, the theme of the movie is racially toned and shows similar stereotypes that people may view towards other races. Crash takes you through all the emotions that you may feel if placed in similar situations, but unlike American History X you are left wondering how you would respond if placed in a ""Crash"" situation. Will you have the same responses as the characters in the movie or would you respond differently. The only way to know is to be put into your own ""Crash"" and see what you would do."
"bowie03","Null","0","3","27 October 2010"," A film that depicts racial overtones in our society
","The film combines several stories about issues of race involving several characters who live in Los Angeles. The theme of this film is racism and stereotypes about different groups of people. The film contributed to this theme by portraying how white people are afraid of black people. This film depicts characters in Crash within the context of many typical ethnic stereotypes that exist in our society today. For example, that Latino character with a shaved head and tattoos is a gang banger, an upper-class white woman who is discomforted by the sight of two young Black kids is a racist, two young Black kids as being criminals, but these story lines causes these characters to rethink their own feelings and beliefs during their ""crash moment"" when they realize what really exists within themselves. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle plays Detective Graham who is a black detective who has a younger brother that is a small time criminal and their mother cares more about the younger brother which bothers him. The Cabots are a white couple played by Sandra Bullock who plays Jean Cabot the wife of Rick Cabot who is played by Brendan Fraser. Rick is a district attorney and Jean has a strong dislike for groups of people other than herself. Chris Bridges plays Anthony who is a young black man who doesn't like white people. Larenz Tate plays Peter who is a young black man who seems to be more open to other races. <br/><br/>The Thayers are a black couple who are very successful played by Terrence Howard who plays Cameron and Thandie Newton who plays his wife Christine. This couple is confronted by Officer Ryan, played by Matt Dillion, a white cop subjects them to a humiliating, questioning and an inappropriate body search of Christine, while his new partner, another white cop played by Ryan Phillippe watches. And, Shaun Toub plays Farhad who is a Middle Eastern store owner who feels threatened because of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks who decides to purchase a gun for protection. <br/><br/>Another film with a racial theme is Gran Torino. This film addresses racism and the negative effects it can have. Also, it demonstrates that when faced with the realities of beliefs and viewpoints, people can change. <br/><br/>The color and angle of the film were great. For example, when Christine was involved in a car accident and was pinned in her car. The camera was able to capture all of the angles of the accident. The color of the fire was realistic and the natural lighting in that scene enhanced the fear that was lingering. <br/><br/>These characters emotionally and physically collide in this dramatic film. Their lives avoidably connect and their prejudices and biases are exposed. Some of them learn from their racial experiences while others find out about their dark side."
"ltpblake","Null","0","3","26 October 2010"," Many different lives accidentally connecting
","Film Review: Crash – 2004 Crash is a movie about people who live completely different lives and end up crossing paths with each other. Each person is guilty of racism in some type of way and they are all personally affected, changed, damaged, or victimized by this racism. Each character is made up of many layers which does not allow you to figure out exactly who that person is and how they will come out at the end of the film. The following are names of the major actors and actresses who make up this outstanding film cast:<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock as Jean Cabot<br/><br/>Matt Dillon as Officer John Ryan<br/><br/>Don Cheadle as Detective Graham Waters<br/><br/>Brendan Fraser as Rick Cabot<br/><br/>Terrance Howard as Cameron Thayer<br/><br/>Ludicrous as Anthony<br/><br/>Thandie Newton as Christine Thayer<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe as Officer Tom Hansen<br/><br/>Larenz Tate as Peter Waters<br/><br/>Jennifer Esposito as Ria The theme of this movie is prejudice, racism, and stereotypes. It shows individuals, family members, business people, working people, and strangers saying the most hurtful and cruel things to one another. Every character in the movie has their own situation or irony facing a range of prejudice, such as, gender, class, and, race. In one scene of the movie, an Asian woman and Ria, a Latina detective, get into a car accident with one another and the Asian woman blames Ria for causing the accident and makes a comment about Mexicans not knowing how to drive. The Latina woman makes a comment back to the Asian woman about her being too short to see over the steering wheel and that she was the reason that the accident happened. This is one example of how stereotyping is used in the film. A scene that gives an example of racism would be when two black men, Anthony and Peter, are walking in the middle of downtown Los Angeles talking about white people getting better service than black people. Anthony commented on a black waitress only wanting to serve white people because she assumed that black people don't tip. Ironically, Anthony ended up not tipping the waitress because he said she gave him bad service. This film's theme is similar to the theme in American History X because both films give examples of racism, stereotypes, and prejudices. Each film shows the harsh reality of how ignorant people can be and how badly people can treat each other. Two techniques that worked really well with the theme of this film were the lighting and sound effects. Low-level lighting was used in the scenes where characters were plotting crimes and in scenes of sadness and misery. High-level lighting was used in the action scenes or rich people scenes. Sharpness, high gloss, contrasting colors, and shiny objects in the background are used for demonstrating situations where the characters are wealthy and their surroundings are supposed to look perfect. The sound effects for this film that were extremely appropriate were the noisy, city sounds of Los Angeles and the sound of silence. Each one gave a dramatic effect and made you feel as though you were involved in every storyline of the movie."
"matthe28","Null","0","3","19 September 2010"," Movie about racial tensions
","My movie for this week was the movie ""Crash"", and it is a movie based on the social prejudices and stereotypes of today's society. The racial tension that this movie brings to light is not only sad, but at the same time, honestly portrayed because these very scenarios in this movie are everyday real life situations quite frankly. A few of the major characters are Rick and Jean Cabot, which are played by Brenden Fraser and Sandra Bullock. They are walking down the street about to get into their car when they are robbed at gunpoint by two black guys, and this act only confirms Jean Cabot's suspicions about young blacks in that neighborhood must be looking for trouble. Other characters were Cameron Thayer and his wife Christine Thayer, played by Terrance Howard and Thandie Newton respectively. Here's another type of racial profiling because Cameron was a well off movie director with money, and he and his wife are harassed by two white L.A.P.D officers just because they were black. Matt Dillion played one of the racist cops, and he was sort of dealing with his own prejudices against the system so to speak because of the lack of help he felt was not there to assist him with his ailing father. Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges plays the role of Anthony, and his excuse for everything that's wrong in a black man's life is directly the fault of the white-man. Instead of doing away with all his excuses and taking responsibility for his actions, he'd rather steal cars from white people and continue thinking the way he does. The lighting is appropriate in this movie, especially on the scene when the Persian father was about to shoot the Mexican locksmith, and his daughter ran out in front of the gun shots. The scene went into slow motion and the lighting got hazy, emphasizing the magnitude of that moment. The camera angle was an important factor in the scene where Christine Thayer's vehicle had flipped, and she was stuck inside. The trail of gasoline from her car to other car was vividly shown by the angle of the camera, and it further added to the urgency for police to free her from the car and almost certain death.<br/><br/>The movie ""Crash"" forces viewers to acknowledge more than just the typical black and white problems of racism. But this movie opens it up to the rich verses the poor issues of racism, the post-911 issues of racism that mostly all Middle Eastern people had to deal with probably, and the issues of racism within one's own race about how one should conduct themselves given certain dramatic situations."

","I must insist that the thoughts I record when writing my reviews for IMDb are all my own, but before starting a review, I almost always read several others. I always include reading those by Roger Ebert (who, believe it or not, can drop some terrible clangers as to the detail of films — I first noticed this in his reviews of Unforgiven and A Chorus Line — which do rather shake your confidence in his judgment); and The Guardian here in Britain as well as those enthusiastic IMDb members who, like me, like to add our two ha'porth worth. Among the members' reviews there are invariably those which go to extremes and laud this or that film as quite possibly the best film ever made (presumably until they write their next review), and those that insist that this or that film is just so bad, it should be put out for cat litter. I find it difficult to take either of those kinds of reviews seriously. But Crash is one such film which arouses extreme emotions. As for the external reviewers, Ebert liked it (I think — it's not always were clear what he thinks) but one of the reviewers for the Guardian was lukewarm. His criticisms can be summed up as 'liberals being self-consciously 'edgily' un-PC' — he suspects that in various pitches to drum up support for the film, the fact that its treatment of race is 'edgy' was much to the forefront. Admittedly, the acknowledged aim of writer/director Paul Haggis was to make us, the viewers, aware that racism is everywhere and even in ourselves if we care to look closely enough, and in the Guardian reviewer's view that is about as original as announcing that water is wet. Yet on this occasion the chap is being too harsh. The 'message' of Crash is, perhaps, not quite as earth-shattering as Haggis would have us believe, but if, just for the moment, one can put the 'message' to one side, he and his producers deserve a great deal of credit for the film he made. It is never, ever dull and at times is immensely gripping. OK, there might, or might not, be some truth in the charge that Haggis's array of characters do tend to the stereotype, but from the six years I worked as a newspaper reporter I know that, without exception, each and every one of us can tend to stereotype if viewed from a distance. It is only when others get to know us better that our individuality emerges, but even then — well, the news isn't always great. How often have we got to know someone better and discovered traits which weren't at all to our liking? Crash stands out in that there are no heroes or villains, no good guys and bad guys, merely people with their several flaws. It is very refreshing to watch a film such as Crash. It is a truthful. There is none of that posturing to effect all to common in modern cinema, and the characters shown in Crash behave as, in my experience, people do. At no point did it sound a false note. As for the sheer and admittedly huge coincidence of everyone coming into contact with everyone else, well, that didn't bother me a jot. Do we complain that Twelfth Night is unrealistic in that it is highly unlikely a woman could successfully masquerade as a man so well that another woman falls in love with her believing her to be a man? And although it would be presumptious to compare Paul Haggis to William Shakespeare they have in common that they are creating, or attempting to create, works of art. As far as I am concerned the essence of art, whether it be pure sound, paint on canvas, hewn stone, a film, a novel or a performance by an actor is manipulation and at the end of the day the only thing that counts is whether the creator of that work of art carries it off. And most certainly Haggis does carry it off. At no point does the level of coincidence jar. Overall, Crash is a one-off and a very successful one-off at that. If you like good cinema, do yourself a favour and give it a whirl. You really will not regret it. There is not a bad performance in it."

","The plot of ""Crash"" is a group of people are connected in one way or another in a 24 hour period in LA. Connected being by way of family, relationships, hate, love, or by pure coincides. Mayor actors/actresses that appear in this movie are; Don Cheadle (Det. Graham Waters), Sandra Bullock (Jean Cabot), Matt Dillion (Officer John Ryan), Jennifer Esposito (Ria), and Karina Arroyava (Elizabeth). The theme of this film is prevalent throughout the movie, wanting the viewers to know that there is good and bad in every human being, and also not to judge people you don't know by the color of their skin or the normal stereotype they represent. Two techniques that I found really appealing in the film were irony and use of title to represent the meaning of the movie. I thought ""Crash"" was an extremely appropriate title for the movie. At the very beginning of the movie, one of the main characters, Graham Waters who is a detective is telling his partner, (which later you find out he has intimate relations with) ""no one in LA touches each other."" He then says, ""Everyone lives behind a wall of metal and glass; I think we crash into each other just to feel something."" The entire movie is about how people are so judgmental towards each other and have such strong racial hatred towards others. That is the only feeling they know and the only way they can crash into each other is by hatred. The irony in this movie also represents great emotion and understanding of the characters. One scene that really sticks out to mean where I was totally hung on the irony was when a young Mexican father tells his daughter this bedtime story one night after work when she is think she hears a gun shot in the neighborhood. He gives her an imaginary cape that will protect her that he got from a fairy when he was younger. She totally believes the story and has her daddy put the cape over her shoulders and she falls asleep. At the end of the movie, a man comes to the family's house to kill the father because he thinks he broke into his store. The little girl sees her dad outside talking to the man with the gun and she tells her mom that her dad doesn't have the cape and he isn't safe. She then takes off outside just as the man shoots the gun, the little girl jumps into her dads arms and ironically the bullets doesn't hit the girl or the dad. Everyone is amazed and can't believe what just happened. The man with the gun later on tells his daughter, that the little girl was his angel. This was a really good movie, and I really recommend ""Crash"" if you're looking for an emotion film that really has a message of not judging anyone by the color of their skin or their background."

","Some of the acting is pretty good, but the intent of the film seems a bit loose. If the intent is to show we all have prejudice, it succeeds on some level. If the intent is to show we all are capable of good and bad, it doesn't quite make it. If the intent is to show that all races in megacultural societies try, it's not realistic. What it doesn't show is that people operate most comfortably in their own culture with like people. This is not necessarily racially motivated--more, financially/socially. This is a truth. The dialogue is a bit stereotypic;it is someone else's version of how we speak. Again, mostly it is socially/economically oriented. The wealthy people are afraid of being robbed; the poor people feel abused and used. As long as America and like countries follow fascistic and republican tracks, this will never change. It is basically a have/have not society where people rarely cross over social barriers except through notoriety or fame. The rest of us are slotted by birth, family, education, etc. The lie is that America works. It is just another version of pre-revolutionary France. In order to be president of anything, you must have the backing and it is financial. You must cooperate with industry. Industry and banks run the nation. Politicians, Hollywood, and Madison Ave. are advertising puppets. It is about conformity.The rest of us have to deal with the anger and disappointment in the streets. The rich take cabs and have doormen. You are not immune unless you have a house in Dubai. What else have we got but who we are and what else to do than blame each other for our problems? I have to live with crazies, hoods and sickos in a city trying to lure wealthy Euros while it lets its infrastructure fall apart. I take the subway with messed up teens and street people who want to push anyone around because it makes their impotence less real. How do you fix that? I wait in long lines for everything and pay more than suburbanites for it. How do you fix that? I tolerate as best I can foreigners who ignorantly think they can impose their culture on ours because those who come here have money. This, after all, is the America they've been told has to tolerate everything and protect everyone! This is impossible. America is impossible. The freedom of all means nobody is free and nobody is represented. It makes lobal warming appear to be a blessing."

","Crash is not a great movie, but it is pretty good (sometimes very). The problem when you think about it is obvious, it is too short. The scenario gives us a large and varied handful of people, perhaps too many to fit into a one hundred minute story. As a result, Crash feels a little underdeveloped, and pretty contrived. Despite that, the drama is solid, the acting is superb, and the movie's intentions are noble. Probably a film worth seeing.<br/><br/>Set up a little like Pulp Fiction, with shorter scenes, Crash intertwines the lives of various people living in the darker parts of Los Angeles. Among them: a racist but dedicated cop, a middle eastern shop keeper on the verge of bankruptcy, a pair of street thieves, and a young couple going through marriage trouble, after receiving police abuse one night.<br/><br/>Crash is not a movie to fall in love with, but it is a respectable motion picture that is able to make do with what it has."

","""Crash"" is often described as an ""anti-racist"" film, but it does not fit the normal template for issue movies about racism, which normally deal with some injustice perpetrated by white racists against blacks (often in the Deep South) and with the efforts of black people, often assisted by liberal whites, to combat that injustice. ""Crash"", which is set in Los Angeles, has a complex plot consisting of a number of separate, but interlocking, sub-plots dealing with various aspects of racial tensions in the city. The cast is made up not solely of Caucasians and African-Americans but also contains Hispanics, Koreans, Chinese and Iranians. The title refers not only to an actual car crash which plays an important part in the plot but also to the ways in which people ""crash"" into one another when their lives collide.<br/><br/>The plot is too complex to summarise here. Some of the main characters, however, are the following:- Rick Cabot, the city's white District Attorney and his wife Jean.<br/><br/>Anthony, an African American car thief and Peter Waters, his Anthony's friend and partner in crime.<br/><br/>Graham Waters, Peter's brother. Whereas Peter has chosen a criminal lifestyle, Graham has made a career for himself as a detective on the police force.<br/><br/>John Ryan, a bigoted white police officer and Tommy Hansen, his partner.<br/><br/>Cameron Thayer, a black television director and his wife Christine.<br/><br/>Daniel Ruiz, a Mexican-American locksmith.<br/><br/>Farhad, an Iranian shopkeeper.<br/><br/>Although the main characters are drawn from a variety of different racial backgrounds, many of them (and some of the minor characters as well) are guilty of displaying racial attitudes- not prejudice towards blacks, but also prejudice towards whites, towards Hispanics, towards Asians and towards Middle Easterners. Even those who are the victims of prejudice themselves may also display it towards other races. Farhad, for example, experiences racial harassment from white Americans, who mistakenly refer to him as an ""Arab"", but his reaction makes it clear that he finds this offensive because he himself dislikes Arabs and resents being taken for one. Other characters may not display racism in the sense of prejudice towards another race or favouritism towards their own, but are nevertheless prepared to exploit racial tensions for their own ends. An example is Cabot, who is prepared to manipulate the evidence against a white cop accused of shooting a black colleague in the hope that this will win him votes among the black community.<br/><br/>Yet, despite the prejudices they display, most of the characters are not wholly evil. One character who seems to have aroused particular controversy is that of Ryan. In one scene he is seen to be abusing his authority by sexually molesting Christine under the pretext of searching for weapons. Yet in a later scene he bravely and selflessly risks his life in order to rescue from a burning car a woman who, in an ironic twist, turns out to be Christine herself. Ryan's racist attitudes are explained in terms of the damage done to his father's business by local affirmative action policies.<br/><br/>What is so controversial about Ryan is that he offends against our preconceptions (about movie characters if not about real life individuals) that a person who commits one base action will inevitably prove to be an irredeemably corrupt villain in all other respects. Ryan, in fact, is only one example of a theme running throughout the film, the idea that no person can be regarded as wholly evil or wholly good. This idea is applied generally, not merely to questions of racial attitudes. Anthony, for example, seems at first sight to be a thoroughly unpleasant individual, yet at the end of the film he saves a group of illegal Asian immigrants from a life of virtual slavery, even though he does not like ""Chinamen"", as he calls them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, characters who initially appear admirable show that they have a dark side. Hansen at first seems to be a liberal; he requests a transfer because he is offended by his partner Ryan's racist attitudes. Later, however, he shoots a young black man dead when he over-reacts during an argument. Graham also appears at first sight to be a conscientious officer, but he later agrees to withhold evidence and thereby pervert the course of justice in order to have the District Attorney drop a case against his brother Peter. (Ironically, Peter turns out to be the man killed by Hansen).<br/><br/>I must admit that I have never seen ""Brokeback Mountain"", so am unable to enter into the controversy as to whether that film should have beaten ""Crash"" to the Best Picture Oscar in 2005. I can, however, say that ""Crash"" is an excellent film which certainly makes a worthy winner. It is a good example of ensemble acting, with all the cast making a valuable contribution, even though there are no outstanding star performances. It has an intelligent, well-written script which asks some difficult questions, not just about racial issues but also about human nature in general. It is not, however, a dry, abstract exercise in social or moral philosophy but also a powerful human drama with a number of emotionally gripping scenes. Occasionally the complexity of the plot makes it difficult to follow, and there seem to be one of two loose ends, but overall this is a very good film indeed. It is remarkable that Paul Haggis, the co-writer, co-producer and director had previously directed only one feature film, ""Red Hot"" eleven years earlier. 8/10"

","How could someone be born into a multicultural society and still see only what the naked eye lets you? There are no words to describe this kind of hatred; there are no words to explain this injustice. This interesting point is brought before the world, and the world is deceived with the inevitability of the fact that everyone has their justification. The justification that everyone has to pursue because there is no other choice, this justification would be death. The movie ""Crash"" written by Mark Lewison; acts as a mirror into the minds and hearts of everyday people. This movie lets us view who we (humanity), really are; and we are detestable and an undeserved people.<br/><br/>The setting is a Los Angeles involving characters that are inter-related to each other without even realizing this. There in the big city live these people with their opinions about everyone else except for themselves. These characters seem to have everyone else figured out, but what about their own lives? What about the configuring and bewildering issues that dwell in their own homes? There are at least seven situations involved in this story line and every one of these situations there is someone that is judging someone else for their construed information about their personal ethnic heritage. These problems are the key factor in this movie, to overcome and understand the real meaning of abhorrence of another person's race. To find out what it really means to be a person of the underlined text, and that is hope. Hope for the next person to come along and pick up where we left off at; and that place is understanding. To understand another people that are not from your own, traditionally we may call that wisdom.<br/><br/>To my understanding, as I watched this movie that was portrayed by brave characters, I see how humanity is reacting who we really are. As for the human race, we may have been one of those characters in that movie; we maybe under motivated and uncultivated too much for our own good. All I know is that this cycle has to stop somewhere and sometime soon."

Many, if not most people go to the movies for the simple entertainment value, where as others go in order to seek out something familiar and often painful within themselves. The former movie goer is eager to see something where there are good guys and bad guys and despite seemingly insurmountable odds, the good guy prevails at the last moment, creating a perfect circle of meaning and the ultimate satisfaction that good triumphs over evil; a happy little package with a perfectly tied bow. The latter film-goer however, comes in with the understanding that life, or at least a brief glimpse into people's lives, is a linear event, often not turning out in happy endings or even providing endings at all. It is with this understanding that the viewing of this film must be undertaken.

"syou","8","0","4","20 November 2007"," Crash!
","Unlike any other inspiration movies I have ever seen, Crash is by far the most influential movie. But in addition to the wonder movie plot, acting story line, I have many negative things to say about the movie as well. First of all, I believe it's important to recognize this movie as one of the most motivated film ever made. The topic of the movie is racism in America. However Paul Haggis, director, focused this problem in Los Angeles because of its hectic nature. The story introduces many characters with different ethnicity and slow brings these characters into each other's life. All of these characters are diverse of the way they live life, but they're also similar in the way that they accepts the hidden racism that's affecting the world everyday. The movie portrays the typical racial stereotypes and shows that it's an evitable concept that is here to stay in our community forever. In one scenario, a white woman Jean Cabot, played by Sandra Bullock, become extremely racist after being pointed with a gun during her encounter with two black men on the street. When Jean saw the locksmith, Daniel, installing new locks on her door, she demands to her husband Rick, played by Brendan Fraser, to have those locks removed because Daniel is Mexican. The movie is so emotionally packed with radical circumstances that Haggis leaves the audiences no room to decide who are justified and who aren't. Ludicrous' character is an example of this confusion. He plays Anthony, a black gang member who is extremely self-conscious about his ethnicity. During many moments when he's faced with a White man, automatically Anthony assumes the man is making typical black racial comments. The problem is this is that most of the times, he's the one who keeps refer back to the racist comments others had made about his people. This leaves me the impression that he's actually more racists about his ethnicity than what the society has placed upon him. The actors were phenomenal for portraying their appropriate role. Of all the characters I find Daniel, played by Michael Pena, especially convincing. Daniel is a young hardworking Hispanic immigrant with a loving wife and a beautiful naïve daughter Lara. Because of their low income, the family is forced to live in a criminal environment. The father daughter scene was truly moving. When Daniel comes home from work, he finds Lara hiding under her bed scared by the sound of guns outside her window. As an affectionate father, Daniel tells Lara the story of an imaginary guardian angel who gave him a 'charm' which will always protect him from any evil. Then he passes the 'charm' to Lara and kissed her to sleep. Lara, now wearing the 'charm', is convinced that she's protected from all harm. So when the Persian storeowner who is convinced that the Mexican will rob his store, he fires the gun to Daniel as Lara jumps in front of her father to protect him. Daniel screams and breaks down to tears while holding Lara in his arms. The feeling of witnessing the situation is revolting. At first you will feel petrified watching the little girl resting on the father's shoulders as he screams in despair. But sudden you'll find yourself speechless as you see the girl slowly look up to her father. The bullet missed Lara. How? That's what you should find out. I respect the ending of the story. Unlike other movies, the director ended the story on a neutral tone. Instead of try to end racism, Haggis left the problem as it is. I believe this adds to the reason why the movie is so respected. Haggis' point is that racism is never endless when we have diverse people together in the same melting pot struggling for the competition of survival. It's the price we all have to pay for living in America. Even though the leaders of the country try hard to end racism, it's just impossible to achieve this idealistic notion. What I really liked about the whole movie is that it's not just a propaganda to stop discrimination, but it's also acts as a notion that allows individuals have their own understanding of the issue. Because the movie involves with characters of various race, more people will be able to relate themselves with the matter and hopefully react to it in an idealistic fashion. The negative thing I didn't like about the movie is the exaggerated and the unrealistic racial discriminations. I believe the director had embellished the issue a little too much. Taking the movie to a much personal account, I believe Haggis took the topic too dramatic to an extend that it's almost insulting. Not everyone in the city is as racists as the characters in the movie. Most of the people are too busy dealing with their own lives rather than getting into other's lives. Just like police Graham had said in the opening of the movie, ""You brush past people, people bump into you. In L.A., nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."""

","A black detective barters to save his felon brother from life in prison. A white officer of the LAPD struggles with his dying father's HMO. A Hispanic locksmith works to keep his wife and daughter out of the dangerous neighborhood they've left behind. What do all of these people have in common? They are just a few characters in the three-time-Oscar-winning film entitled, Crash, who find themselves battling and, often simultaneously, contributing to the common racial prejudices that plague modern-day Los Angeles. While the theme is often force-fed at times, the powerful music, suspenseful plot, superb acting, thrilling cinematography and vivid character development make this a prized film of our time. <br/><br/>Writer and director Paul Haggis takes us on a roller-coaster ride of emotions from the disparity and anguish that each character experiences to their ultimate chance at redemption. For Officer John Ryan played by Oscar-nominated actor Matt Dillon, the story begins with a phone call to his father's health insurance company. He pleads with a black female representative who tells him they cannot help his father. Angry and frustrated, Dillon's character deliberately stops a car carrying a black husband and wife and gropes the woman. Her husband, a successful producer played by Terrance Howard, chooses to sit back and do nothing to preserve his reputation. At the same time, Officer Ryan's white partner serves as a disturbed onlooker, unwilling to take a stand against the injustice. Ryan later sums up the film when he tells him, ""you think you know who you are you have no idea.""<br/><br/>The theme of the film, though forced at times, is both simple and critical. We shouldn't judge those around us based on racial, sexual or any other prejudices. The characters in the film make this painfully obvious throughout their development. A previously judgmental black carjacker played by Ludicrous is given a wake-up call and a second chance. The once prejudice wife of the city's District Attorney finds an unlikely friend at a time when she needs one most. The theme applies to the network of characters whose lives eventually and profoundly ""crash"" into one another by story's end.<br/><br/>The choice of Haggis to use Christmas in Los Angeles as the film's setting is remarkably befitting, presenting a sort of ironic seasonal imagery throughout the story. While Christmas tends to carry with it the connotation of holiday cheer, Haggis challenges this by accompanying it with a slew of dismal events in a city that rarely sees snowfall. Also noteworthy is Haggis' choice to use a racially diverse city like Los Angeles and a notoriously racist organization like the LAPD to convey the theme. These examples of Haggis' creativity prove effective as characters from different backgrounds collide.<br/><br/>As with all great films, the music in Crash is moving and plot-appropriate. Music producer and composer Mark Isham takes hold of our spirits and doesn't let go. One particular example of this is shown through the gripping scene where the store owner stands before the locksmith, pointing a gun. This scene, together with the music, is so powerful it sends the proverbial chill down the spines of its audience. With Isham, composer of music from such films as Miracle, Bobby, and Oscar-nominated ¬A River Runs Through It, Crash will have you putting a hand over your heart (IMDB.com).<br/><br/>Another element of the film that adds to its tone is its abundance of great actors. Those not previously mentioned include Don Cheadle as the black detective, Jennifer Esposito as Ria, Brendan Fraser as the DA and Sandra Bullock as the DA's wife. Matt Dillon's portrayal of Officer Ryan is especially captivating. Rarely does a film come along that makes us truly feel and understand the characters and their situations. The convincing acting of such a stellar cast adds to the credibility of the film's message.<br/><br/>Lastly, what credibility does a film offer without realistic and creative cinematography? Steadicam operator and cinematographer James Muro makes us feel we are right there with the characters. Muro shines through Crash from his experience filming blockbuster hits such as Miami Vice, Titanic and Terminator 2 (IMDB.com). From the scene where Officer Ryan struggles to save the trapped woman from her burning car to the scene where snow finally comes to Los Angeles, Muro's camera work brings us to the action, once again, making the movie all the more effective.<br/><br/>There is little wonder why Crash is so highly acclaimed. Its iconoclastic theme begs us to learn to change. First-rate acting and dramatic music bring credibility to the already captivating storyline. Fresh cinematography creates realism and the crisp character development makes us sympathize. No other film makes us think more about how we treat others or how we give in to prejudice. Perhaps only in dire times of need do we disregard our differences and work together to save ourselves from peril."

","The movie Crash, co-written, directed, and produced by Paul Haggis, is an image of honesty, violence, truth, and irony projected beautifully onto the screen.

Nearly ever screenplay he has written has claimed success. Among the list is Academy Award winner Million Dollar Baby, and Flags of Our Fathers. In 2003 Razor magazine published a list of, ""nonconformists that defy dictates, the iconoclasts that cling to independent thought, the radicals that refuse adherence - that give us pause. They are what legends are made of."" And sitting within the top 25 was Paul Haggis. After watching Crash, it is evident why.<br/><br/>""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know?

Almost every word provokes thought, so this movie is not one to catch on a light-hearted whim. <br/><br/>The characters in Crash are presented and are almost immediately developed. There is no superficial, graceful entry into their lives; instead the audience is harshly, honestly, and abruptly thrown into each character's engagements. Through a series of their actions and consequences, the movie emphasizes how vital it is for human kind (despite race, age, or gender) to be honest with each other. <br/><br/>The work is poignant.

The difficult task of blending multiple stories into a convincing whole without any trace of artificiality or exaggerated sentimentality is an admirable achievement.Life as it is with the increasing tendency of present-day man to isolate himself and hide behind prejudices towards others as a form of survival in a mad, mad world. Not a moralizing or judgemental approach as to what we are as human beings but an illustration of the complex aspects of our nature and how easily good can turn to bad and vice versa. Our narrow-minded outlook on the world around us and how easily we debase individuals by defining them as belonging to an inferior class or race is the main theme on which the movie is based. The issue however is not that simple and the most important aspect of this movie is that it sees things as they really are: our urban environment and our personal experiences with people in general do not encourage real confidence in our fellow man. There remains however a glimmer of hope and the message ""Crash"" conveys is that by gaining insight into the fact that our attitudes in general are based more on the unforeseen and casual incidents we experience in everyday life than on our so-called deep convictions, we could (possibly) become better people.A lot of reviews consider the movie weak due to its radical and therefore limited analysis of racism in general and that it focuses too often on a form of cheap emotional content. But let's be honest: isn't that precisely the only way most people in the real world function?"

If Brokeback mountain was about a heterosexual couple than in would have gotten ZERO publicity. I do not think it right to judge a movie just on its merits.<br/><br/>Crash was a great movie with a an incredible, story a great acting from every cast member and wonderful directing. Sadly this movie will go down as the movie that ripped off Brokeback mountain.

","This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen my whole life. It's a beautiful film about racism and social problems, and is directed and produced with precision. Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, and Terrence Howard are 3 of many extremely talented actors who appeared, all of which represented their characters perfectly. It is also one of the few times I've been impressed with a rapper-gone-actor, as Ludicrous gives an outstanding performance as a car-jacker. Another impressive detail is the way that the story lines mesh together. All of the major characters in the movie met with another at least one time, creating a giant web of characters. It is an absolutely fantastic film, and I recommend it to anyone with a heart and a brain."
"Chrivhec","7","0","7","31 August 2007"," The greatest competitor of Brokeback Mountain deserved its Oscar for Best Picture.
","Like every year, 5 strong Oscar nominees for Best Picture of the Oscars of 2006: Brokeback Mountain, Capote, Crash, Good Night and Good Luck and Munich. Although they both are terrific movies, Capote and Good Night and Good Luck had too strong contestants to win the Oscar for best Picture. They had great stories but the stories of the other 3 nominees are still stronger. But they deserved to be nominated of course, and Philip Seymour Hoffman earned his Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The nominees for that Oscar were alright, although I'd rather seen Eric Bana nominated for Munich instead of Heath Ledger for Brokeback Mountain. But that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>So there were 3 movies left to be Best Picture: Brokeback Mountain, Crash and Munich. Although Munich is an incredible and terrific movie by all means, it couldn't measure up to Brokeback Mountain and Crash because of their interesting and exceptional stories. Sometimes fiction beats reality and history when it deals with an amazing subject. And this year we have that situation.<br/><br/>So actually the greatest 'battle' was between Brokeback Mountain and Crash. And the reason why Crash won, is because the concept of racism is still more intriguing than homosexuality. 'Love is a force of nature' was the strong tag-line of Brokeback Mountain, and although the movie is as good as it can be, the masterpiece of Paul Haggis took over. Crash deals with such a fascinating subject. The collision of a group of people who are facing racism and who are in some way connected to each other. Each story of every man or woman in that film is as intriguing as the concept of the whole movie itself. And the cast is absolutely great. They all have supporting roles, and every role is just as good as the other ones. Matt Dillon did great and deserved to be nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Maybe Sandra Bullock deserved to be nominated too, but apparently she had too little votes to be in the top 5. I'm pretty sure they considered her to be nominated though. And of course the rest of the cast is fabulous: Brendan Fraser, Michael Peña, Ryan Phillippe, Terrence Howard,  very well done.<br/><br/>Crash also delivers a big scale message about racism, and I actually felt different after seeing the movie. Not that I am a racist, I definitely am not, but it gets to you anyway. I hope a lot of people have already seen this movie and a lot of people will see it. It will always be remembered as the greatest film of 2005-2006."

The characters are well developed, and extremely well acted. The pace is brisk, and the cinematography rings true to the film. Crash makes no judgments.

This movie does an astounding job of pointing this out, and will stay with me for a long time."
"transcendingpictures","10","0","7","15 August 2007"," The Best Picture of the Year
","""Crash"" is a motion picture experience not to be missed. It's truly miraculous how writer/director Paul Haggis and his team creates such a poignant and important story with so many characters, that by the end of the 1 hour 45 Minute running time (so short of a film of this degree of characterization), one feels so connect to these people.<br/><br/>I've seen the film 4 times now and my last viewing was the most powerful for me. It's a testament to the care and passion put into the writing by Haggis and Robert Moresco, and the dramatic execution of the story. I'm sure most people have seen the film given it deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture, so I won't go into detail on the events of the story. It's amazing how with only a few scenes with each of the dozen characters the film follows, I felt so engaged by their lives and choices, and genuinely connected to their struggles. The way that Haggis touches on the most authentic and dramatic beats of each, and the skill and confidence he has telling these intertwining stories is the work of a master storyteller and consummate filmmaker. And this was Paul's feature directing debut which makes it especially inspiring and noteworthy.<br/><br/>For me, the strongest elements were the use of the little girl and her idealistic sense of courage and faith, and how she became such a beacon of appreciation and hope for her father (Michael Pena) and the store owner who threatened him (Dato Bakhtadze). It was so touching and beautifully executed. Also, one of the final scenes with Tom (Ryan Phillippe) and Peter (Larenz Tate) was powerful, especially in its representation. I wondered why in this film the most devastating action was the shooting of a benign criminal by a good cop. Upon closer analysis of the film, I believe that this is the perfect metaphor for the world today. Tom is a good cop who decided to sell out on his principles and not follow through on his actions to expose Matt Dillon's character's shady police work. Peter is a criminal with strong spiritual beliefs who consciously knows better yet still continues to do wrong. By having the good guy who does nothing and the bad guy who knows better being the two to have the final and focal conflict (the film starts off with the aftermath of this action), we see that these are the types of people that are shaping the world the way that it is today. The tragic and painful context of the world today is largely a result of the good that do nothing and the bad that know better. That's what I took from it and for me it opens up a lot of conversation on this important issue. A great film presents powerful themes, and ""Crash"" cuts to the heart of the issues. Ultimately, this film has a hopeful message rooted in unity, forgiveness, love and transformation. And the realism of the characters in the relateable and believable social context makes the experience all the more personal and topical. <br/><br/>""Crash"" is easily one of my top 10 favorite films, and I look forward to what filmmakers like Paul Haggis, Robert Moresco, Bob Yari, Cathy Schulman and their teams create in the future. This is a near perfect film in my opinion. Dramatic. Important. Poignant. Enpowering. Great writing, acting and directing. 11/10."

","With films like ""Crash,"" you have to be very careful. That is to say, you can't underplay the plot to make room for show-stealing roles, and you can't overplay the plot and hide the performances. In my modest opinion, ""Crash"" is a great balancing act. Still, though I loved it, I can easily understand why others did not.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is really a morality tale told through the stories of a day-and-a-half in the lives of several people. There are humongous themes of racism, profiling, and other modern ""taboos."" The real message is that racism is everywhere and in everyone, which is a bold statement. People often comment that they feel as if they're being talked down to as they watch the film, which is understandable, but I had no problem with it. ""Crash"" doesn't linger for too long in any certain type of racism, and concentrates more on stories and character studies. Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, and Ludicrous all hold there own, Terrence Howard is very complex and great to watch, and Matt Dillon gives a stand-out and uncharacteristic performance as the most openly racist character in the film: an ultra-white cop with ""daddy issues."" ""Crash"" is a great film, and I think it's worthy of ten stars. still, I wouldn't put it up there with the real greats, like ""The Godfather"" and ""Casablanca."" I cannot guarantee that you will like it, but it's worth seeing for the interesting take on racism and the good/great performances."

","I had been looking forward to seeing Crash since before its Oscar win but my DVD rental people only decided to send it recently! It was worth the wait (although continued the trend of depressing films they keep sending...).<br/><br/>Crash tells the story of a group of people living in LA who are all either racist or the victims of racism and whose lives become intertwined in various way. My main quibble with how it dealt with the story was the incredibly bluntness of it all - to me it all seemed a bit over the top and impossible that so many people could be so racist - but I am in England not LA so things may well be very different there! This all made for some scenes which were incredibly uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is well structured with all the various story lines tying up together without being overly convoluted or spoon fed.<br/><br/>The acting on the whole was superb. Sandra Bullock and Matt Dillon deserve special mentions in my opinion for their portrayal of distinctly distasteful characters. One sore point for me was Brendan Fraser who irritated me slightly (although he does seem to do this in every film since I endured the horror that is Bedazzled).<br/><br/>Visually the film is quite impressive, depicting the nature of the subject matter well. The score is also supportive of the action on screen without being distracting.<br/><br/>This is a very good film that should be seen, but be prepared for some uncomfortable viewing."

","Occasionally the best film of the year actually wins the Oscar for best film. Crash is a wonderful way to spend two hours.

And despite the hatred and cruelty it describes, it gives hope that things can get better for us all. That is if we can survive our own gross stupidity.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of the ensemble cast and the multi story format so well executed by Robert Altmann. Lately that genre has become a little tired, but this is right up there with the best. The cast is so consistently good, and each of the interlinking stories has an important contribution to make. <br/><br/>Those who like good and evil to be set up like cans on a rock may not enjoy this movie.

"Pedro_H","9","0","7","26 April 2007"," A fantastic movie -- important, if not perfect
","In modern day LA a group of urban professionals, gangsters and their significant-others struggle with life, racism and relationships during a highly overheated 36 hours.<br/><br/>The technique of Crash (the directorial product of Million Dollar Baby author Paul Haggis) is to flip between stories and characters like a horse fly buzzing around looking for fresh blood to suck before moving on to the next victim. Sometimes we don't stick around for the aftermath - as if it can be taken as read or presumed. Not original and in terms of plot development, but nevertheless very moving.<br/><br/>Its major fault is that seeks to ring maximum emotion of the scenes at the price of plausibility or even clear reason. For example, I have no idea why Sandra Bullock's character suddenly saw the light and hugs her maid. To give but one example.<br/><br/>What I like best is that nobody quite comes away clean. Nobody gets a full clean bill of health. Even honest cop Don Cheadle (the nearest thing to the main star) describes his partner as ""Mexican"" when her parentage is not actually from Mexico. In LA - this movie says - very few people have time for detail or have much consideration for the feelings of others.<br/><br/>Housewife Sandra Bullock is spoilt and presumes that the tattooed locksmith is a gang-banger - when he is not, he is a loving father. She chastises the Latin American housekeeper for not putting the cups away without seeing how much she does for them and what she provides.<br/><br/>Politician husband Brendan Fraiser only wants to spin everything to his own advantage - even being car jacked! <br/><br/>Cheadle is a cop with troubled blood relatives and a seen-it-done-it attitude to life. In this movie even cops are not all one and the same team.<br/><br/>In other stories gangsters discuss the racism and stereotyping they help create and a storekeeper doesn't understand enough English to comprehend what a fellow tradesman is trying to say. And so it goes on.<br/><br/>LA is portrayed fairly as a bag of races, creeds and winners/losers. But given the USA is a free country why do they chose to live there? Have they no choice? They are people with no general love of their fellow man - strangers, screw 'em, this movie seems to be saying. Nor does the movie allow you to relax - good people do bad things and bad people do good things. The movie rips away your normal security blanket.<br/><br/>The snow (in LA?) and the cinematography play to make it seem like a kind of dream. Or even an extended ""serious"" pop video. The real world - but not quite. A pastiche of the real LA and the real LA experience, but not the real one. <br/><br/>I rate Crash one of the most important films of the new millennium. It asks questions (although without answering them all) about why America cannot settle down. We - in the UK - are heading towards having a capital where only half the resident population are white. And I knew London when it was as white as any major city in the world and yet it doesn't have this level of tension and animosity. Is this because you cannot - as the film opening line makes out - live totally behind steel and glass here?<br/><br/>While this film seems to split people - I am glad it won the Best Picture Oscar. This is adult cinema in a world of cartoons. Let us hope that for director Paul Haggis good things come in threes and he has one more classic up his sleeve..."

"jeff_le_man","10","0","4","4 October 2006"," A great look at our society. Warning major spoilers
","""Crash"" has a large name to live up to. Originally released in 2004, it went unnoticed to most people. Through word of mouth and an aggressive advertising campaign the movie received a huge boost in popularity that culminated in the winning of the 2006 academy award for best picture. ""Crash"" is a roller coaster ride of well developed emotions. It is a crash course in discovering how difference in class and race is all that is needed to turn strangers to enemies in our society. ""Crash"" is a beautifully constructed film and is one of the few to fully live up to the hype.<br/><br/>The film covers two days in Los Angeles in which a group of radically different people randomly interact and ""crash"" with each other through a series of coincidences and ironic events. The movies principle is introduced in the first lines spoken by Don Cheadle. ""It's the sense of touch. Any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people. People bump into you. In L.A, nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something"". These lines implicitly foreshadow the crashing of these random people all separated by race and class. That's what crash is. It's a metaphor for these interactions and coincidental occurrences that are always occurring throughout life. ""Crash"" is a strange movie. It can be viewed just for enjoyment and be a very satisfying movie or it can be analyzed and deciphered to reveal many hidden themes and ideas that Haiggis portrays through his script. The story revolves around a police detective with a drugged up mother and a criminal young brother, two car thieves who are constantly commenting on class and race, the white district attorney and his irritated wife, a racist white cop (caring for a sick father at home) who upsets his younger partner, a successful Hollywood director and his wife who must deal with the racist cop, a Persian-immigrant father who buys a gun to protect his shop, a Hispanic locksmith and his young daughter, and more. All the people interact with each other in some way, which leads to a very meaningful and heartfelt climax where some of the characters are enlightened and some aren't as lucky.<br/><br/>The movies strongest scenes feature Matt Dillon, who was nominated for an academy award for his part, and Thandie Newton who also shows that unlike her previous movies she can act very well. Perhaps the strongest scene of the movie is the car accident where Dillon's character saves Newton's. Other actors all deliver strong performances and all seem perfectly suited for the rolls in which they are given. Michael Pena ,who was seen in last summers World Trade Center, gives a particularly applaud worthy performance as the little girls father and he proves once again that he is among the finest new actors in the business. The directing is above top notch also. Paul Haggis made his directorial debut with Crash, which he also wrote. Crash marked the second best picture Oscar movie that Haggis has written, the first being Million Dollar Baby. Haggis' next project is the new James bond movie Casino Royale that early reviews are praising. The cinematography of ""Crash"" is Excellent and uses wide angles shots and crisp clear lenses along with disjointed camera angles to convey the chaos and unpredictability of the characters lives. Also lingering close ups often without sound are used to show characters emotion throughout the films key moments. The soundtrack also adds to much of the emotion going on in a positive way. The movies tight script is very well constructed. It manages to be gritty, heart warming, violent, spontaneous, witty, shocking, thought provoking, and ultimately tragic all at the same time while always keeping character development as a main priority. The movie is also brilliantly paced for its two hour running time; it never feels boring awkward or cheesy.<br/><br/>A closer look at the material shows that ""Crash"" is an in depth look at many themes. Those most prominent being racism, cause and effect, regaining dignity, coincidences, and tragedy. Throughout the movie the relationships between the characters are weakened or destroyed and only when characters are enlightened do they finally strengthen. A perfect example is when Matt Dillon's racist police officer character molests Thandie Newton's Character in an act of racial discrimination in front of her husband. Later in the movie he arrives on the scene of her car accident and in a moment of panic between the two he throws away his prejudices and accepts that they are both human beings and successfully saves her life. This is an example of an epiphany for Matt Dillon's character. Ryan Phillipe's character is also believed not to be a racist but when he is in the car with a black man and the black man reaches for his pocket, Ryan Phillipe's character shoots the man dead. This is also an epiphany because it is revealed that he to is a racist even though he appeared on the surface not to be. Ironically even the health adviser lady who appeared to be merely a victim of prejudice was a racist herself as seen in the last scene in the movie when she says to a man with an accent ""I don't want to speak with anyone who doesn't talk American"". ""Crash"" conveys such a large scale of emotions such as happiness, anger, contempt, fear, pity, and many others. It reveals how stereotypes shape the way the human race views the world so much that sometimes humans generalize people by skin colour or social class before even meeting them."

","My once modest respect for Paul Haggis has profoundly elevated due to his alarmingly integral and vividly realistic perception of the real world as it is. Crash explicitly illustrates the high racial tensions, class distinctions and general prejudice which is often overlooked in contemporary society. Although the plot is arguably unoriginal, the entire cast pitch in their best efforts to convey Paul Haggis' screenplay in the most dramatic, sympathetic and genuine way possible.<br/><br/>Crash consists of different sagas of people who are of various classes, races and cultures all sprouting from the viewpoints of six to eight people. The beauty of Crash is that there is no one protagonist, no actor who displays better histrionic capability than another, no redundant scene which compels you to push the fast forward button; everything falls into place, and like several puzzle pieces all finely clicked together, Crash illustrates incidents in the real world.<br/><br/>From the heart thumping scenes of molestation based on the grounds of racial profiling, to a bigot cop's redemption, to the persistent diatribes of of an affluent white man's wife, to the immoral actions of two unstable black men, the medley of emotions one feels during and after the play are ineffably intense."

As I put the pieces of this ensemble together, comparing it to films like the safe and dated 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner', to the eternally relevant and timeless classic 'Do the Right Thing' serve to show 'Crash' as truly unique and invigorating because its tragic and near tragic moments leave it open for debating how we rationalize our fears based on our treatment of each other which often gets out of control as quickly as a fire and we are unable to control it."
"Bandit1974","9","0","3","13 July 2006"," Subtle Hatred
","I read the user comment that accompanies the movies statistics (actors, directors, awards etc.) and the user commented that this was the worst movie ever made and that it handled the subject of racism in a childish manner. The user went on to say that if you'd like to see a ""real"" movie about racism than you should see American History X.<br/><br/>First of all, American History X is a phenomenal movie. It tackles the subject of racism like no other movie, but I do believe it explores racism at its worst. I think Crash explores the subtle racism that exists on a much more prevalent level. The true hate crimes that are depicted in American History X are horrific, but I believe racism exists in a larger number of people the way it is portrayed in Crash. Racism is based upon fear and ignorance and that is what we see in Crash. People that are afraid and ignorant. Every day people if you ask me.<br/><br/>A woman (Bullock's character Jean Cabot) sees two black men walking down the street and she instinctively draws herself closer to her husband. A Lebanese store owner calls a lock smith because his door will not close. The Hispanic lock smith tells the store owner that the problem isn't his lock it's the door. The store owner tells him to ""Just fix it,"" and the lock smith informs him that he needs to call someone who sells doors. The store owner insists that he fix it and accuses the lock smith of trying to rip him off because he probably has a friend that sells doors. Does this sound irrational? That's because most of the characters in this movie are, but to me they are real.<br/><br/>Most of the characters in Crash are flawed to some degree which makes them even more real. Not only does Crash explore racism amongst several different cultures it also explores how people deal with racism within their own culture. As the movie clearly demonstrates, racism exists in every culture and none of us deal with it intelligently. In Crash a man is accused of not being black enough by his wife. That same man tells another black man that, ""You embarrass me,"" because he is living up to many of the stereo types placed upon black people.<br/><br/>More than racism I think Crash explores another problem in our society. Our culture has become much more diverse over the years and it would appear that communication between the many different cultures is a HUGE problem. This of course can ultimately lead to racism."

","Crash, baring in mind it is not at all real, is an excellent film. If people want to find truth in it though, this is not the place. It is no more nor less a representation of reality than JFK or other conspiratorial types of films. Crash makes it seem as if Los Angeles is about ready to erupt into mass hysteria with racial battle-lines being drawn as people arm themselves. This is not the case-- at least not in the affluent areas or even middle-class areas. In the areas of Los Angeles stricken by poverty this might be more prevalent, although its a statistical fact that most violence in those areas are people inflicting harm on others of the same race. <br/><br/>Having said that, lets address Crash as a pure piece of fiction. It is very well crafted, with excellent characters and great performances. Like an episodic, I found myself wanting to know what happened to a particular character next, while at the same time being sucked into the next character and story line just as quickly. Excellent film-making."

","In CRASH, Canadian-born director Paul Haggis takes us on a whirlwind tour of race relations in L.A., where people from many nations collide every day. He examines how we view each other and how our lives intersect through a series of vignettes, and after awhile the film began resembling MAGNOLIA in its structure and plot; it even includes a slightly miraculous act of nature, although nothing as dramatic as raining frogs. Alas, there is no Tom Cruise on hand to anchor this episodic film. The best we get in CRASH is Matt Dillon as an anguished cop with an ailing father and Don Cheadle as a detective with a missing brother and drug-addicted mother. Both are very good, but neither has the star power to provide the focus of the film; this is strictly an ensemble piece, using a mix of known and unknown actors in key roles. It is sort of fun to watch the normally wholesome Sandra Bullock as D.A. Brendan Fraser's wife getting all potty mouthed and bigoted after she is carjacked by a couple of street blacks. An initially almost unrecognizable Ryan Phillipe plays Dillon's squad car partner, and ends up being the most tragic figure of them all."

But i can appreciate why it was widely regarded as a good film and i repeat GOOD, not Great.<br/><br/>Its set in LA over 2 days and is made up of a series of small stories, entwining at some points throughout with Each story supposedly reflecting an aspect of racial tension or problem within American society etc. Some of which i feel worked well and were perfectly realistic and others i felt the Director tried to force upon the audience. I feel it doesn't tackle the broader problem of racism but merely highlights minor aspects of it therefor i feel it will receive mixed responses from all sides of society.<br/><br/>It terms of how the film is constructed, i was very impressed with how the director controlled the information being given to the audience and all the separate stories progress consistently and i personally found myself engrossed throughout and not at stop start intervals. The Music reflects the moderate pace of the film and the Cinematic aspects are fresh but not over the top which makes it a film that isn't too intense visually but mentally.<br/><br/>The acting award in this film has to go to Matt Dillon as i feel he portrayed his character the best, and was believable in the role as was Don Cheadle who is fast becoming one of a few actors i have complete faith in.<br/><br/>All in all, i feel it is worth a watch.

Its style of weaving multiple stories with a single thread makes us realize how everything happening around us is all connected.<br/><br/>The performance of Matt Dillon was amazing with a wonderful portrayal of the different shades of his character. The difference of Matt Dillon the ""racist bad guy "" and Matt Dillon the ""good cop with a sense of duty"" has been portrayed with great dexterity.

"nara-5","9","0","5","18 April 2006"," A good but obvious movie, about things that needed to be said, and that too NOW
","First of all, it is of course no coincidence that this movie was released now. Or that it won the Oscars now. One should not forget the timing factor, even for the Oscars. There are few absolute Oscar movies, and lots of relative ones. And I think Crash is one of the later. Given 9/11 and the subsequent unfolding of worldwide events, these were things that had to be said and they had to be said NOW. Even if they are obvious things.<br/><br/>There is no story in this movie, yes. The only binding factor among the disparate characters/lifestyles/sets is racism, and how it impacts one's daily life. This movie is, simply put, a one-idea movie. It deals exclusively with racism, or, even better, racist stereotyping. If you find this boring, stern or limiting, then this movie is indeed not for you. <br/><br/>Racism. The storyline may not be one that is easily foreseeable, but the typologies so well enacted by the actors are of the commonly identifiable, black and white type (no pun intended): the ""Arab"" shop-owner immigrants, the Latinos, the high-class black family, the street-smart black guys, the well-balanced politician, the lonely black cop, the xenophobe cop, the successful but neglected wife and so on. <br/><br/>And then there comes racist stereotyping, which is in fact the main ""character"" of the movie. This one also comes in all possible shades: the stereotyping arising out of ignorance, the one out of hurry, laziness or absent-mindedness, or just simply out of habit. Some characters in the movie are questioning their own actions, others just act blindly. But like most of us (wild assumption), many of the characters are very much aware of their stereotyping, yet they act on it out of a fuzzy sense of fear that we have rooted deep within: better to be safe than sorry.<br/><br/>It's almost as if you can see the people behind this screenplay brainstorming and writing down all possible ideas, scenes, typologies and characters as they pop up. ""what about adding a Latino...what about some Arabs...or some alienated rich black guy"" and what about this and that. <br/><br/>But going beyond racist behaviors arising out of common stereotypes, the movie traces down in a sometimes funny and imaginative way their most unlikely roots. And so it goes about depicting things that go close to how -one thing following another in a chain reaction manner- a tight shoe can lead to murder. And at the end of the movie, to twist it even more, in a very obvious attempt to explore all imaginable facets of the issue, even the good guy turns bad and the bad guy turns good.<br/><br/>Appearance is smashed into pieces and reality, ugly as it can be, is reconstructed with them. The movie is intended to be a collage with a message. But by no means does this make it less palatable or watchable. Anyone who is able to follow a basic Discovery documentary will find no difficulty in following the thread. Reviews calling Crash as ""unwatchable"" are simply out of range. And those who claim it's just plain morbid are rather naive. <br/><br/>Yes, it's not the usual movie directing. It does take on the form of a semi-documentary on purpose, precisely to highlight the everydayness of it all. No matter how quirkily the events unfold or how didactically this movie is made, one cannot help to ponder over the issues and recognize ones every-day self in it. <br/><br/>All in all, Crash is a well-crafted piece of cinema, with good casting and good acting. It is no doubt a good movie. It might not enthrall you, it might not enlighten you in any way. Yet, it somehow works."

We're not all racist.<br/><br/>The movie circles around several different lives, who come from all different backgrounds; black, white, Persian, Mexican and others. All living in Los Angeles, the film shows the struggles and hardships and persecutions that these people go through in their daily lives. Taking place in the span of 24 hours, the film does do an excellent job of telling a story that is quite moving, and at times very intense.<br/><br/>I thought everyone involved in the film was excellent, especially Saundra Bullock, who was my personal favorite, alongside Ryan Phillipe, who both did outstanding jobs. Not that the rest of the cast, shouldn't be noted on their work. <br/><br/>The problem I had with the film was that they make it seem like all of America is racist, when in reality Americans have no conception of what racism is. We are so politically correct these days, that even if someone looks at you funny on the street, people automatically think it's because you're black? That makes no sense. They try to prove this point in the film. I disagreed with almost the whole film. Although it does shed light on a few interesting topics, that are more than likely true, it still felt like an advertisement, more than a film.<br/><br/>However, I do appreciate the storyline, the direction, acting and cinematography. The individual stories in the film were excellent and it was quite entertaining to watch.

It had some nice stories and acting but it seemed a bit superficial in a way. I found that the film was too short for me to really feel anything for the characters except for Terence Howard's wife who was sexually harassed. I probably seem a bit weird saying that it's too short but I'm used to characters being fully developed in front of me in a movie such as ""Magnolia."" (Which people incessantly compare ""Crash"" to) I did enjoy watching the film because I love multiple storyline narratives and I liked some of the character's stories in this. The film looks great. It really just looks good for some reason. Maybe it's the choice of filters, the film type, etc. I don't know but the colours are very warm and I like that. The only slightly technical thing I had a problem with was the music. It just didn't fit. Throughout the main titles it sounded fine but in a crucial moment such as when Farhad shoots Daniel's (The locksmith's) daughter it just sounded wrong. In that moment i expected a sweeping, soaring piece but it was instead some synth stabs and pad washes. Didn't fit at all.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a good movie save for a few disappointments but it certainly did not deserve Best Picture.

Some of the situations seem forced just to make a point. The transformation of the Bullock character from a whiny, racist bitch to Mother Teresa following a tumble down the stairs is unconvincing.

I did not look for myself or for others in the characters but found us all in there. More importantly I found a movie that showed a side of humanity without preaching, without making it too ""hollywood"". Simply a movie that will haunt me more and more. There are a couple of scenes that will live with you forever. I had thought this would contain much in the way of ""race baiting"", but found that not only was this not the case it seemed to offer some genuine insight in to lives and into stereotypes that we use without thinking. I don't believe that it was mired in the typical wash of political incorrectness masquerading as good screen writing, it was instead simply a look behind all of the black, brown, white, and yellow faces that we see everyday. Who are we to judge those we do not know?"

","The way the movie portrays people's anger and the decision/judgments they make guided by blind anger. The characters' roles in the movie are woven out in a simple yet complex manner which carries the audience from scene to related-but-not-related scene in a fulfilling way. its been Million Dollar Baby since I watched a movie this interesting. its not the usual story, bad guy, good guy, lovers breakups and makeups etc... There's no bad guy, there's no good guy. people are not necessarily bad because of the things they do today. and the big lesson is, There are no bad and good people in the world, just bad and good things! A particularly like Chris and Cheadle's characters. they played them brilliantly."

","This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It reached something deep inside of me and I think that anyone has some heart would feel the same way. The casting, the plot, everything had it's place in this movie. All the events that took place were linked with each other greatly. This one deserves a way better rating. I recommend this one to all those who believe in second chances. I think this movie belongs to those that have really something to say. It speaks about people, about feelings and in a way it teaches us a lot of things, which I guess, everyone who saw the movie, should figure out by themselves. Of course, every film wants to teach us something, but this one does it in a special, almost brutal manor. This is a must see."

","Even our prejudices comes a full circle. As Matt Dillon says in the movie ""You think you know who you are... You have no idea!"" Give it time, stay open and you can become what you hate or turn into what inspires you.... We are all so closed in our lives. Our reactions to everything outside so prejudiced, hardened and vitriolic, that to see that we are all the same - that we are all hurt and burned by the same thing, that we are all moved and healed by the same touch, that we are all indeed brothers and sisters - we really need a jolt/a deeper wound/an unkinder cut/a leap of faith or a turn for heroism !.. We need to crash into one another to become one again! The opening quotes, paraphrased, I think sums up the whole theme of the movie for me - ""It's the sense of touch. In any real city, you walk, you know? You brush past people, people bump into you... Here, nobody touches you. We're always behind this metal and glass. I think we miss that touch SO MUCH, that we crash into each other, just so we can feel something."" That being said, I wouldn't go so far as to say this is a great movie. It provides very thin and topical suggestions of the racism and prejudices in modern-day society. This is not a cerebral achievement or for that matter a deeply intellectual movie. Intermingled plots in tenuous circumstances make whatever changes of heart/guard/faith that the characters undergo seem at times circumstantial, rather than something that was deeply provoking and meaningful to their lives. But then again, I think this movie aims to be what it is  A warm message of oneness, a gentle warning against our prejudices- and perhaps nothing more. I don't know if it is really Oscar-worthy. But it's worth a while to watch it and there is definitely something you can take back home with you."

","Crash is definitely a strong dose of reality. There is no subtlety about this movie. It is so in your face that you can't help but think about it and remember it for a very long time.<br/><br/>Crash tells the interconnecting stories of a group of people from different ethnic groups who live in LA and have there different stereotypes about each other. In the next 36 hours they are all about to collide in a way that will change them forever. There is no holding back with these people. Many of them are very blatant about how they feel, and the opinions they have about one another will have us, as viewers, thinking that we aren't that much different with our own feelings.<br/><br/>The acting is the best part of Crash. Everybody is given depth and we learn to understand why they feel the way they do. But once we think we have the characters figured out, we are thrown a curve ball, and our opinions are suddenly changed about them.<br/><br/>The movie also contains some very powerful scenes. Two in particular stand out in my mind. One involves and overturned SUV where a victim has to be saved before the SUVs leaking gas catches fire. The other involves a father and his daughter which begins at the movie's earliest proceedings as a tender moment that will eventually lead to a big payoff near the film's end.<br/><br/>Even though Crash is a well done film, it still contains some predictable scenes which take away from it's power. It also becomes a little too preachy, but none of this really makes the film boring or too overwhelming. Definitely recommended."

","This is a unique time in the history of L.A. We find ourselves roiling and 'crashing' in a stew pot of people very different from ourselves. Most of us are finding that we must, every day, expand our ability to understand and emphasize with the 'other'. Often, our patience gets stretched, sometimes it snaps. We are called upon to make the most difficult moral choices in dealing with each other and through those choices, we find out who we really are (""You think you know who you are?"") - IF we choose to look and listen to our own reactions.<br/><br/>That is why ""CRASH"" is a fable for our times. Paul Haggis is an evocator of possibilities - the multilevel possibilities of our moral choices and their repercussions, as he was in ""MILLION DOLLAR BABY"". But, this fable of possibilities (""CRASH"") contains exaggerated characters, fantasized situations, miracles and madness - as aids to get at the dirty, rotten, unvarnished truth.<br/><br/>Its getting to be an exceedingly complicated world out there folks.

","This movie is fantastic. It pulls at your emotions, makes you question your own identity and the views you hold and brings the topic of racism into the 21st century. Each character is rich, real and displays a certain element of good and bad, making them so much more to relate to. I think Matt Dillon was fantastic in this role (He was robbed of an Oscar!!), as were Ludicrous and Thandie Newton. Everyone in this film deserves mentioning. The movie is well written, well acted and well directed. All in all it is brilliant and I highly suggest you take the time to watch it. You won't regret it and you'll be glad that you watched it."

","Racism, that's always been a problem in America. Its no more a secret, every body knows it and Crash makes sure it brings out the exact feel and the mood of the situation. It does not over play it neither it is under played. The screenplay is perfect it has a brilliance in it to stand out and even though i have not seen the rest of the film that's was in contention for the Oscar i feel this deserve one and go with the jury. It has a big star-cast in it starting from Sandra Bullock to Arnold(in a photo), everybody is apt in their role the casting is perfect.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon who was nominated for Supporting Actor, even though his performance is too good in the film i don't think he deserves a nomination. His role was so short in the movie that you don't even feel he is there in the movie, this is not for his character alone but every other character in the movie is treated the same way. Some scenes are very intense in the movie that even you are not part of the system you feel the pain and specially the scene when the Persian guy shoots the little girl.<br/><br/>The film moves smoothly from the title to the credit, the shifting of one shot/scene to the other is really well handled. The editor might deserve it for his work but still i have not seen the others to conclude but his work is neat. The question if this film deserves an Oscar, well i think the jury might have gone with the issue that has been dealt in the film rather than the box office collection, which is a good thing and will be leading to the making of more meaning full film. So Crash of course had crashed in the right spot."

The truth behind this film is extraordinary and stuck with me for time to come afterward. I have to admit, I have just bought the DVD.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton was exceptional in her role of the TV directors' wife. Sandra Bullock impressed as Mr Brendan Fraser, and Matt Dillon simply stole the show from cinema greats such as Don Cheadle. Even Jennifer Esposito impressed me!

"Philby-3","7","0","2","13 March 2006"," Haggis finds multi plotting a tricky business
","""Multi plotting"", in which a group of often disparate characters with their own story lines meet and intermingle, has been a popular film format since at least ""Grand Hotel"" in 1932. Robert Altman, who was given a special Oscar in 2006 has used this technique to good effect in several of his movies, starting with ""Nashville"" (1976) and another recent successful exponent was Paul Thomas Anderson in ""Magnolia"". It's an effective technique but requires a lot of skill to make it work. It has a tendency to put an emotional distance between the audience and the characters, making it harder for viewers to identify with them, and one can finish up feeling one is just observing pond life through a microscope.<br/><br/>In this film, writer/director Paul Haggis, a very experienced TV producer, gives us some well-rounded characters, such as Don Cheadle's amiable black detective, but others, if not cardboard cut-outs are rather flat, such as Sandra Bullock's angry housewife Jean, and her slimy District Attorney husband Rick (Brendan Fraser). Other characters are shameless exercises in audience manipulation, for example Matt Dillon's very well acted white racist LAPD operative who after behaving very badly towards a middle-class couple, saves the wife from a fiery death. Just to press the point home we also discover he is an attentive son to his ailing elderly father (and engaged in a battle over Dad's health insurance cover with an unsympathetic black bureaucrat).<br/><br/>It was difficult to have much sympathy for the Iranian storeowner who was unable to recognise that he, and not the latino locksmith was responsible for making the store easier to burgle. Maybe we would understand him better if we knew, say, that he used to work for the Shah's secret police. There is plenty of tension when he confronts the locksmith with a gun, but once again our emotions are manipulated (via the locksmith's daughter).<br/><br/>Again, the black car-jacking desperados are such obvious dickheads it is difficult to empathise with them also, but the story line is manipulated in such a way as to put them in a different light.<br/><br/>It has to be said most of the acting is first-rate and the story lines are well handled, though there are some loose ends. It was only right at the end I realised that after the first scene (at the crash  no more than a fender bender) that the whole film is in flashback  frankly I thought that was too tricky. Oscar material? Really, no. I haven't seen ""Munich"" but ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Capote"" and ""Goodnight and Good Luck"" are all superior in their different ways. So how did it win? Well, more than half the academy live in the LA area and obviously thought the film told it how it is, or how it feels to be an Angelino. As an outsider though, I am at the other end of the microscope."

"Syrchek","8","0","4","11 March 2006"," Not a huge newness in the abundant world of movies but still very good.
","As it's already well known, the occurrence is set in contemporary Los Angeles. Here we are pinned to the short and also contemporary stories of a few individuals that come from various ends of society. And somehow their everyday lives cross or should I say crash over each other because of numerous and coincidental events. A series of events, reactions and counter reactions determine the stories pace and direction.<br/><br/>You never know who is the next person you are going to crash into. Throughout the story the only person that seems to be the nexus of all these incidents is an official called Graham (Don Cheadle). Despite his ignorance considering the causes of most events, he is the starting-point to almost every character in the film. <br/><br/>The heart of the story rotates around the attempt to expose the duality of each and every person involved in a certain situation. On one side of the medal the characters are shown as cold, racist, annoying, angry, on the other side, the position they found them self's into stimulates them to act unselfishly, kindly, openly and make a few hard self-sacrifices.<br/><br/>I've had high hopes before seeing this film. I expected something more dramatic, more serious and more complex. Astonishingly there is a good deal of humor and cynicism in some parts. And unfortunately a good deal of clichés too. The dialogs could use some sharpening in the sense of memorizing them. I also think that it's a bit too much involved in the general stereotypes about each race. But ultimately the film proves that those exact stereotypes, no matter how stupid we think they are, are the main reason for racial intolerance.<br/><br/>What I also could not fully digest is the periodic notion that I am watching a TV-film and not a big screen release. Maybe it had something to do with the ""look"" of the film. But don't worry about that. Even the most fanatic visual-technical freak will gradually skip that aspect and get pulled in the series of deeply moving scenes. And hands down to each and every actor. To me it is almost impossible to pick the absolute best performance. It's one of last years best movies, though far from perfect, you will remember it for the edginess of it's characters. And also for the accuracy in modifying and converting their tones.<br/><br/>........ 4/5 ........"

Using racism as a theme, it explores all the variations of who, when, where, and why, but with zero pandering to the audience, a sly use of stereotypes, and truth-seeking avoidance of PC-ness. On occasion, situations may seem a little too poetic for their own good, but this is a minor point, and in fact, I'm willing to call this film an EPIC Poem about Racism and Redemption (This is how I see 1998's ""The Thin Red Line"" - an epic Poem to War.

There are many stories in Crash that could each be an entire novel, or at least a major short story. In this day of sampling every thing - the aesthetic of using smaller pieces for a reassembled larger result seems to fit - taking strong aspects of each story, weaving them into a new rhythm, tying them together with a consistent tone, and constructing a highly complex yet focused new work.

It really makes you think about your life and how everyone interacts with each other. Crash makes you rethink your actions. I have never really been a racist person, and racist things have always bothered me. I come from a small town so I see a lot of racism every day. Crash is a movie that everyone, from every race, and every walk of life can relate to. Even though it has some bad language, it is not obvious. Some movies throw it in there just to ""be cool"".

My expectations were quite high, but I wasn't disappointed. It was actually even better than I thought. The story contains several intertwining story lines involving around 20 people from many races that collide in the space of 36 hours. Its truly amazing to watch all these characters effected and how they change throughout. The film is really showing how people are in this day and age and how they react to different situations.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is the cast, which is one of the biggest I can think of. Although some are given slightly more screen time than others, none dominate the picture, although there are certainly several stand-out performances. For me, the best performance came from Michael Lena as a locksmith who has some of the films most powerful and emotional scenes. He was criminally overlooked at the SAG awards by not being included in the award for ensemble cast, even though William Fichtner (though the good actor he is) was only in one scene and was included. However, his performance was Oscar Worthy and I really hope he goes onto bigger and better things after this because his performance was truly tremendous.<br/><br/>He is nearly matched by Don Cheadle and Matt Dillon whos performances seem to get better and better every new movie they star in and Dillon received a well deserved nomination. Good luck to him come the Acadamey Awards. The other performances are all first-rate and everyone has significant roles in the story.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Acadamey Awards, though I haven't seen the other nominated films, it appears to be a two-legged race between Crash and Brokeback Mountain. Although I haven't seen Brokeback I would really love Crash to win Best Picture as it really is one of the most challenging and thought provoking films I can think of.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a must see film for every mature person out there and provides a realist look at modern day people and how we react to those around us.<br/><br/>10/10"

That magical scene with his daughter & the cape was worth the price of admission by itself. Ditto for Ryan Phillipe's work. He's never impressed me in anything he's done until now. But I pegged him as the moral center of the film when I first saw it, the character we were supposed to admire & be most comfortable in identifying with. And his ultimate betrayal of everything he seemed to stand for previously still hit me like a punch in the gut upon second viewing. <br/><br/>Seeing Sandra Bullock play a privileged suburban bitch was a real treat. I always knew she had it in her, but it was great to see her cast off the mantle of American's Favorite Comedic Actress & show some real skills.

","Frame of reference is an important part of the experience when it comes to viewing ""Crash"". While difficult to separate one's own ""self"" from race and ethnic considerations, the power of the film directs us to challenge our preconceptions about others of different backgrounds. Though the movie relies on more than it's share of coincidence, the events proceed in a way that leave one disoriented when something doesn't occur the way we might expect. The Persian's revenge for example, becomes a life redeeming experience when his weapon fires a blank at a young girl (wearing an invisible cloak). Even the man's explanation is at odds with our mindset; an (guardian) angel saved the Persian from a life of regret, not the life of an innocent.<br/><br/>Name actors never threaten to overcome the story here; presented as an ensemble cast they merge with their characters to make us forget their celebrity status. Particularly convincing in this regard is Sandra Bullock, so expertly cast against type that it's almost shocking to watch. No single character dominates, as lives merge on the collision course of human frailty.<br/><br/>My primary interest in viewing the film was to see how it stacks up against the other Oscar contenders for 2005.

"reason12","9","0","6","5 February 2006"," Nothing is as it seems
","In this complex tale of interlocking relationships and miscommunication, we discover the racial tensions that exist in post 9-11 Los Angeles. Though at times amazingly ironic and coincidental, Paul Haggis creates a tight and believable cast of characters who are confronted by their own racism as well as the racism of their neighbors when their worlds collide and they are stripped of the facade of their bubble. The District Attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock) are held up and their SUV is stolen by two young black men. A Persian family (who is mistaken for being Arabs)do not understand the Hispanic locksmith and when they are later robbed, blame him even though he warned them of their unsafe doors. A Middle class black couple are mistaken for the car thieves and are mistreated by the police. And so it goes.<br/><br/>Misunderstandings and feelings of rage and prejudice froth and foam and at one time create an ensemble of characters the viewer grows to like and, at the same time, creates an atmosphere of unexpected twists and unpredictable characters who just may let the stress of their lives overwhelm them in the heat of the moment. This is a brilliant commentary on the state of racism in our country today and forces us all to ask the hard questions that plague us. Are we racist and how can we reconcile ourselves to our fellow man? As powerful as this film is, it does contain strong language, violent scenes and two sexual scenes which should be taken into consideration depending on the audience."
"mister_nameless","10","0","6","5 February 2006"," The best movie ever!
","I think that the film ""Crash"" is one of the best movies Hollywood had ever produced. It is a very stylish motion picture that introduces us to a cold and pessimistic atmosphere, showing us the true fragility of human lives. In my opinion, a good phrase that fully describes this movie is: ""You think you know who you are? You have no idea."" (one of the movie's tag lines) The magnificently written story illustrates this message with excellence showing us the interconnections between numerous human destinies. People think they know who they are. But they change throughout the course of the movie leading a battle against the banality of life with violent efforts. These people feel the emotions they have never experienced before. Rage, hate, violence and racism give place to love, happiness, friendship and care. The movie's characters are breaking through dozens of obstacles on their way to survive in the cold and lifeless world they live in. By the end of this voyage, these same characters realize that incredible strength lives inside them. They completely rediscover themselves. Film director Paul Haggis chose a very unusual and difficult approach for a Hollywood film, and he succeeded in illustrating it. The people he shows us seem to be common stereotypes, but, in essence, they are not. It's really a miracle, how he could pull together such a great film with real educative values, tons of interesting personalities and stunning fate interconnections. The main strength of the film is that it all works. We never know when and how shall we pay for our own foolishness and excessive pride. We never know what awaits us in future. The message of this movie is very important to understand. If we let the inside evil guide us, we won't be able to save ourselves from the assault of bad luck. To sum it up, ""Crash"" is a powerful film. It is full of surprises and truly deserves viewers' attention. Of course, it also has several weaknesses. Some of the characters are not too well developed and their transition from good to evil or vice versa is way too fast (like Anthony the carjacker). Also, the ends of some film subplots are not shown or fully explained (like detective Waters' search for his brother's killer). What's more, some of the things mentioned in the film are also not too well explained (like the blank bullets in Farhad's gun). But, overall, it's an excellent film with top acting and unforgettable situations. Thumbs up!"

","I'm not often shocked or stunned by films. That is exactly what I was after watching Crash. This was one of the most powerful and mesmerizing films I have ever seen. Not a false note or wasted line of dialogue in the whole picture. One can't help but take a good look at his or herself in the mirror after a film like this. The actors are not portrayed as simply good or bad. There are shades of both and that colors the different scenes. The ensemble cast was astounding and not in the Ocean's 11 or Traffic artificial sort of way. I don't see stuff just because its packed with stars. If that were the case I would of loved Independence Day. These are all talented actors not just pretty faces. The director is completely in control of the audience and gives nothing away. You can predict-and you no doubt will-but you would be wrong. The suspense builds and is sustained until the closing credits after which you will be haunted by what transpired and how it violated your expectations. I didn't feel manipulated by the director because of some forced emotion of political agenda. I was manipulated because I couldn't help but be enthralled by all the characters and what would become of them as the events unfolded. This all transpired in a film under 2 hours long. That too me is remarkable."

Parallel stories narrated briefly, interact creating some kind of circle around the main topic racism, hatred, prejudices, false appearances, the struggle of good and evil. What I really like about this film is the way it makes us look at ourselves in the mirror, and say, hey I really do this sometimes, how come?. Sometimes these short stories end up like a fable and not like it would happen in real life, there's some lyric in every scene, it suggests what it might have happened but does not give us violence or punishment as a solution, only thoughts, deep thoughts."

Crash blows past Do The Right Thing by first acknowledging racial stereotypes but then creating personalities to the characters and adding complexities to the stereotypes. Each negative character is softened by plot developments, and each positive character is darkened by plot developments as well. No one is ""innocent"" and no one is ""guilty.""

The acting by Matt Dillon, Don Cheadle, and Terrence Howard were absolutely phenomenal. Their acting really shows a certain character development that was needed in this type of film. The movie really does spark a roller coaster of emotion that leaves you breathless to the film's end. What makes it even better is that it focuses on something that each and every one of us faces every single day of our lives: Racism. Crash not only makes people focus on racism as a whole but also brings up very interesting points that at some points contradict themselves somewhere in the film, making each and every character more complicated and realistic. Overall, Crash is just one of those revolutionary films that must be seen to truly enjoy its greatness.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."

","I recently rewatched this movie on DVD, having seen it months ago at the movie theatre. I'd forgotten just how very good it is. This is a type of story telling I really enjoy, thought provoking and non-linear, taking something as random as a car crash, then using it as the basis for weaving several apparently disparate story lines together. Intersecting lives showing the ""butterfly wing"" effect, how one event affects another in a chain reaction, until the tiny air movement of a butterfly's wing causes a hurricane. <br/><br/>I also love movies with an ensemble cast such as Crash has, not one huge star and a scattering of lesser mortals but a multitude of parts exploring a wide range of characters. Everyone here was excellent without exception. The film explores such diverse themes as ingrained racism, crime and corruption, the inadequacies of the health care system for the elderly, and family duty, against the backdrop of Los Angeles. It tries to show how none of us can live in isolation in the city, our lives are interdependent whether we like it or not, and, whatever our backgrounds, most of us are trying to find the same things in life; safety, security, a reasonable living. The movie also explores how the constant frustrations of life, and mis-communications can cause people to flip, from anger, fear, distrust and despair. <br/><br/>Matt Dillon's cop trying to care for his father, and Don Cheadle's cop trying to care for his mother, stood out for me, and Jennifer Esposito was very good in too small a part.

","This is a lovely roller-coaster, without gore and blood that I don't want to see in such movies. Quite clean, but not for children.<br/><br/>I usually find crime thrillers tiring to the boot, but this one is different. Racism exists, not in people, not in countries but in situations. One cannot pin down a person as a racist. <br/><br/>The lines between the racist and the victim are blurred and reversed in society. This movie is a valuable documentation of the stress associated with immigrant issues: willful and forced ones. <br/><br/>A myriad of situations are exposed: unintentional racism, harmless racism, spontaneous racism etc. Hate crimes are just one area, other areas are diversity policies, passing insults.<br/><br/>Another facet exposed by the movie is how deeply racist the victims themselves are. How they almost. bring doom on their own worlds by assuming too much in their conditioning and not letting their hearts do the talking. <br/><br/>This is a timely movie. It shows how attempts to eliminate racism have created problems for people on both sides of the divide. It also brings out some smaller issues, for gliding moments: like the inability of HMOs to serve the truly sick. The insensitivity & busy-ness of health care providers to provide genuine health care as compared to 100 patient/hour assembly line care.<br/><br/>There are lessons for everyone in this movie.

"dylan-cross","8","0","4","21 December 2005"," An intense collage of stories set in Los Angeles suburbia.
","For the past five years or so, Hollywood has been producing quite a few movies that deal with ""character clashes"", usually within the backdrop of a large city. In these types of films characters from a variety of backgrounds ""clash"" together during key points in the film as the result of sporadic, short term conflicts. ""Crash"" presents a diverse set of characters ranging from street detectives to doctors in a pivotal film that gives us a glimpse of racial tensions and their complexities. The biggest aspect I loved about this movie is that it presented the biases and stereotypes harbored by everyone in Los Angeles without attempting to get at a moral solution to the problem. I think the story specifically attempted to show what people do in unpredictable situations and how they deal with those situations accordingly. By watching this film, the viewer is not subjected to a detailed morality lesson, but instead gets the perspective of all of the characters and how those perspectives conflict with other people in the story.<br/><br/>Among the backdrop of racial tensions, we're also presented with other problems the characters face, and within that context, we seem to understand their motivations a lot better. Some of the main problems presented in the film are of a housewife unhappy with her marriage and herself, a detective that has no idea how to console his mother, and an Iranian family living in the shadow of fear and paranoia.<br/><br/>I'm really glad I got a chance to finally see this because the characters are very impressive in their performances. Also, we see a lot of unexpected twists of fate that turn up at the most inopportune times, thus further fueling the film's effect on the audience. Unfortunately, at the end there were a few obligatory ""tear jerker"" scenes in the story which I thought were unnecessary and this ultimately identified the film as resembling other Hollywood spawns. However, my final vote is that this movie was gripping, visually impressive, and an awesome work. 8 of 10."

I found the interaction between Thandie Newton's and Matt Dillon's characters to be harrowing yet very realistic. Crash is touted as a realistic fable, and you find yourself clinging to various characters to give you some hope, yet, it is in the unexpected that this film shines.

I mean The Constant Gardner and THe History of Violence over Crash? Come on. Why don't they just hand BBM the award? I mean at least put BBM up against something that could give it some competition and Crash the respect it deserves. I'm so tired of every year movies that should be nominated aren't only because they were released earlier in the year(Passion of The Christ 2004). Though I'd want to see Crash beat BBM if it were nominated, even I can't argue that BBM deserves this over the movies it's up against. And then Terrence Howard gets nominated for the completely wrong movie. Matt Dillon at least pulled out a nomination but I would be very surprised if he won because I don't think the Golden Globes want the Oscars to even consider Crash. Even Munich didn't get nominated! Could the Golden Globe's fear of not wanting BrokeBack Mountain to lose be anymore obvious? The Golden Globes need to stick to television. I always preferred the Oscars over the GGs for various reasons (The Aviator beating Million Dollar Baby) but now they have completely showed their blatant disregard of great films by putting THEIR favorite film of the year up against films we all know will not beat it. Now is that cowardice or what?"
"jaredsundberg","10","0","4","15 December 2005"," Overcoming Adversity
","Overcoming Adversity Crash displays characters that are able to overcome society's stereotypes because all of the characters in the movie are affected by their race and because some of them are able to overcome what society has labeled them as. In addition to this, some of the characters prove that we can't all overcome society and continue to follow their societies stereotypes.<br/><br/>My previous experience with the film was watching the film on 11/15/05 in the upstairs of my house.<br/><br/>Race is the overwhelming issue on the table throughout Crash. Several characters stories are shown in the film, some of which correlate with each other. For example, at one point in the film, a bigot cop pulls over a black couple. After asking the couple to step out of the car, the wife begins to talk back to the officer and the officer then puts them both against the car and pats the wife down in a completely inappropriate way. Later in the film the woman gets into an accident and the same bigot cop goes to help her. She at first refuses to allow him to help her get out of the car, as gas begins to engulf the car though she accepts it, and both barely get out alive. The point remains, that characters in the film overcome what society has stereotyped them as (in this case, the officer breaks his bigot label by saving the black woman).<br/><br/>Some of the characters are labeled by others in the movie Crash. Fro example, the character that Sandra Bullock played in the film was walking on the sidewalk with her husband and upon seeing two black men walking down the street (one of whom was acted by Ludicrous) tensed up. She had always been cautious of black and was somewhat of a bigot. After the two men car jacked her just minutes later, this only supported the feelings she already had of black people in general. Later in the movie though, Ludicrous freed illegal aliens that he found in the back of a truck. He had the chance to sell these aliens but instead freed them and this seems to be a start for his conquering the labels that other put on him without even knowing him.<br/><br/>Not all of the characters of the film Crash are able to overcome what others think of them. For example the young cop in the film is told by his partner that he will soon also be a corrupt officer after their explicit traffic stop. The young cop denies this, but it turns out later in the film that his once strong morals do give way, and he commits murder and ditches the body. Not everyone can be a hero, some are able to conquer, while other fall, and this once head strong cop proves it by sinking down to a murder.<br/><br/>Crash is a film in which many characters are able to conquer societies hurdles of stereotypes and find who they really are."

","Emmy Winner Paul Haggis delivered another outstanding production in "" Crash"" like he bestowed upon us before in ""Million Dollar Baby."" The movie ""Crash"" starts off in Los Angeles with a car accident and leaves the audience wondering what the cause of the accident was. Twenty-four hours earlier flashes across the screen, and we are then introduced to multiple different groups of characters who are complete strangers to one another. The different groups of characters consist of Latinos, African Americans, Caucasians, Asians, and Persians, whose lives all intersect in unpredictable ways. The audience doesn't know how the characters relate to each other until it is revealed near the end of the movie. I found this movie to be brilliant, and after watching it, I became a huge Paul Haggis fan. If you enjoy movies that leave you guessing up until the very last minute, I would recommend this film to you.<br/><br/>There are a number of different plots and sequences, and they all link together in surprising and unique ways. The movie goes back and fourth between each character's different cultural conflicts and the differences they experience due to their different cultural backgrounds. The audience is shown a number of story lines such as: A car accident, a car jacking, vandalism in a marketplace, a suspicious death, and L.A. Policeman being untrustworthy. All the stories circle around one thing, RACISM! All the characters act on certain situations that they are placed in , and we learn that there is good and bad in everyone.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is an extremely powerful film and delivers a strong message. Paul Haggis speaks out about how racism still exists in our society, no matter how much we deny being racist or prejudiced. He shows us how we place segment on strangers by their cultural backgrounds. Haggis includes scenarios throughout the film which makes the audience feel uncomfortable. It is shocking to hear a character say, ""Why do these guys have to be black?"" This movie is disturbing, but depicts reality.<br/><br/>""Crash"" features a Hollywood cast playing unusual roles. A major reason of why this is an excellent movie is because of this amazing cast. It includes: Matt Dillon as a racist police officer, Ryan Phillippe as his nervous partner, Thandie Newton and Terrence Howard as an African- American couple, Larenz Tate and ""Ludacris"" as African-American carjackers, Brendan Fraser as a Caucacian district attorney, Sandra Bullock as his wife who is also Caucasian and a racist, Michael Pena as a polite and caring locksmith who is Latino, and Don Cheadle as an African-American detective. All of the cast deliver magical performances in the roles they play, which makes the movie that much more interesting and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is a film that speaks out about a subject that is very offensive ,and stirs up a lot of controversy in our society today. This movie leads to discussion after seeing it and makes you wonder when we are going to put racism behind us. Or will we ever? This film is made for mature audiences with a R rating for language, sexual content, and some violence. It keeps the audience guessing, and there is never a dull moment. I would suggest you rent this brilliant film, if you haven't already, because it is a subject that needs to be thought about and shouldn't be ignored any longer."

","This movie is a very interesting story about how people's lives intertwine with each other at some point, and how these collisions with each other affect one another's point of views or morals. There is a good amount of foreshadowing and symbolism throughout the film, but the editing is so far gone that there is so much left to want. There are no transitions between scenes with dialogue to cue a response from someone else, or fade-in/fade-outs to show dramatic reactions. There are even some scenes that feel like they were just thrown in so that they could seem like they wanted to ""make people think."" If you watch closely, the close-ups and overheads are very jagged and feel forced, and it makes the viewing experience that much less enjoyable.<br/><br/>The storyline is top notch, but it felt like there were too many characters. If there were maybe 4 less characters, or combined the characters somehow, it would have been better. In the end, I didn't remember anyone's name at all. The creation of main characters is usually done skillfully so that their names are repeated over and over so that the viewers don't forget them. This story had very impactful scenes, but when discussing this with peers or others, it was very hard having a conversation saying ""the woman who was molested by the cop"" or ""the black receptionist lady."" The amount of symbolism and foreshadowing is commendable for this story. If this had been more skillfully displayed for everyone, I would have thought much higher of this movie.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7 out of 10 because I enjoyed the story very much, even to the point where I did think about it for a few days after the movie, but the editing was far too rough and amateur to deserve higher."

Everybody has already said the great things that made this a top #250. But, otherwise, I would like to make some remarks. Don Cheadle made a so intense and vivid performance that make me want to see whole new movie with his character. Sandra Bullock should work more with directors like Paul Haggis. Jennifer Sposito shines on every scene she appears. But, most of all, the experience of watching this Crash is quite philosophical or existentialist. Are we able to change the course of our lives? Are we all puppets of fade? These are good questions that the movie made me think of. So, this great masterpiece discusses tolerance, racism and pain like Altman dis in his great years."

","Crash is about ordinary people in America from different ethnicity and how all their lives are connect. It's about the hidden and open racism that different ethnic backgrounds people have, it's about the little things we do that can actually be a disaster for others, it's about change and to see the world through open eyes and not with our eyes closed. Crash is an in-depth exploration on the themes of racism and prejudice,cause and effect, chance and coincidence, and tragedy,""CRASH"" is a metaphor for the collisions between strangers in the course of a day-to-day existence. Set over a twenty four (24) hour period in contemporary L.A. Crash features terrific casts which include: Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Jennifer Esposito, Brendon Fraser, Chris Bridges, Loretta Devine, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Lorenza Tate. The movie is approximately 113 minutes in length. Crash follows a couple of characters with different backgrounds. We see how these people react to one another, most of the time out of prejudice. We see how a white woman grabs the arm of her husband when two young black men are walking up to them, how one of those black men thinks every white person is a racist, how a white cop pulls a car over only because the people in it are not white, how a couple of people think a young Hispanic man belongs to a gang. We then see that some of the prejudice, although it is wrong to have it, turns out to be true, how the same white cop helps a black woman out of a burning car, just days after violating her on a traffic stop. How she doesn't want him to help rescue her because of the incident, how the same police officer is angry because of the health of his father and that the lady that is responsible for his insurance papers is black, that could explain his behavior. Not justify it, only explain. How a restaurant owner doesn't understand the Hispanic locksmith when he tell him he needs to fix his door not the lock. When the restaurant owner comes back the next morning finds his place destroyed and the insurance adjuster tells him that his insurance doesn't cover it. Because the lock smith told him to fix the door. The restaurant owner then takes his revolver that they had just purchase and goes to the locksmith's home and waits for him. He shoots but nothing happened because they had purchased blanks for the gun. How two gang members want to car jack cars and when they pull over a SUV with a black man in it .The black man retaliates because he tries to explain that is why the black man has it so hard because of people like them. The police are in pursuit of this vehicle and when they pull it over the same white police officer that pulled him and his wife over the day before responds to the other officer to let him go. Towards the end of the movie an Asian guy that got run over by the two Black people had a van full of Asians that would have been sold as sex slaves. You feel sorry for the Asian guy, until you find out he is in the market of selling slaves, and then you feel good he got hit real good with the stolen SUV, since that is what he did with the lives of the people in the van. Shows you can't feel sorry for people all the time when bad things happen. The same black man then was offered money for each of them but in the end he has a change of heart and takes the van back and releases them and even gives them money for food. This movie really makes you examine the way you view and judge others around you. I suggest everyone go see this, no matter what background you come from this movie will truly open your eyes to the real world and what actually goes on. It will amaze you."

","Unfortunately, I've seen several movies like this in the last year and, even if I liked the film, I do think that too much is too much. I accept that having to have the same characters in every scene forces the screenwriter to think a bit and that having the same actors in all the scenes reduces the costs of the movie dramatically, but I shouldn't suffer from it! :)<br/><br/>OK, on the more serious side, this is a good movie. Some of the scenes are hilarious and it is not overly dramatic, as most of the movies of this type are. However, I feel they pushed the interconnectivity a little too far. I mean, the same people meet over and over again ... in L.A. That's statistically improbable.<br/><br/>Also, not being an American, it is hard for me to judge how real the film is. Is the racism such a big problem there? Does it affect every level of society as the movie showed? Are Iranians really not Arab? :) OK, joking here.

Instead of the black and white, two dimensional nature of most attempts at tackling racism, Haggis does a beautiful job of showing how complex racism and discrimination is, and how misunderstanding causes terrible hurt and waste. The link between fear and racism is explored well. And all this without any tinge of ""documentary""ness.

Everyone's inner ugliness and prejudice is brought to the forefront rather than being lightly sidestepped, resulting in the most accurate representation of reality possible. My only criticism is that it didn't generate enough hype or publicity. With an all star cast, it would be assumed that more money could have been pumped into this quasi-low budget film (watch the audio commentary, the quips referring to the sets and movie expenses are too funny), saving it from being relegated to the bottom shelf at Blockbuster.

This is one movie that is not just masterfully made but the message it carries is amazing. Racism is a topic that's been touched before, but its mostly about blacks and whites. Crash envelopes both races, plus all the in betweens. This is movie about the stereotypes in society, and how we see others different from us. No one is shown to be perfect, everyone has flaws, but everyone is human and that is what makes the experience so real. I myself am coloured and have seen white people trying to judge me on it, and i have done the same with them and the Chinese, blacks, Arabs. Everyone will associate with this movie.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis could be called a genius for his splendid direction, which is intensely emotional at times but strangely hilarious the next. The story (or stories rather) connects so wonderfully and you would be hating a character at one point and cheering for him the next. But what will strike you the most is how much you will care for these people on seeing their side of things. <br/><br/>The performances are all excellent and I have developed immense respect for Matt Dillon after seeing this movie. I will never forget his performance and would say he truly deserves recognition. Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillipe and Don Cheadle are also very good.

"JoeStracke","Null","0","2","9 October 2005"," Hate is not black or white.
","This film explores prejudice but not in the way that, say, Spike Lee does. Nothing here is quite so black and white. Everyone is prejudice to some degree that is a part of what being human is. This is a film that lets you explore that aspect of your persona, and either a) reinforce your moral beliefs or b) force you to confront why it is you think the way you do. In other words, if you are set on judging another human being based on how they look, then this film will most likely anger youwhich is, I believe, all the more reason to rent it and watch it with an open heart. Personally, I was raised by a father who spat out racial slurs at every opportunity. This, unfortunately, is not so uncommon. What compelled me to re-think his point of view was two fold: I was endowed with an above-average IQ, and cursed with a father who was an asshole... hence, I was obliged to make up my own mind on a number of things. No matter how noble or righteous you believe your point of view to be, it is always a good thing to reinforce (*not* justify) exactly why it is you feel the way you do.<br/><br/>Please forgive the tangent, but I am not one to believe in black rights, women's rights, gay rights, etc. To me, these are advocating separate but equal rightssomething that is fundamentally wrong and against what the U.S. Constitution stands for. I believe that everyone should have the same base rights but you cannot expect positive results from an antagonist movement. I realize that this is not very realistic in modern society, and that people are (understandably) desiring instant change for unjust representation. I have no issue with the intent of such movementsjust with the need for them in the first place.<br/><br/>Back to the film. If you go into this movie with your prejudice, then you will be both rewarded and chastised for your beliefs. The trick is to pay attention to the effects of such thought, and acknowledge the larger picture. Here is, in effect, a spoiler: judge each human being you meet as the color graythen determine their true color by their actions. True, you may get burned from time to time but at least you will be a decent human being throughout the trials, one that is without regret or remorse. While this may be an overly idealistic point of view at least it's one that beats the alternative perspective of hate and mistrust. At the end of the day, it is only yourself that you need answer to."

Most of these parts are played well by recognizable faces, if not names, a wise decision that makes tracking the various participants very easy.

The impressive part of this massive character list is that although harsh and gritty, few if any of the portrayals are full stereotypes. Portions of many might be considered trite, but even those characteristics are addressed within the context of the film.<br/><br/>With fathers, mothers, brothers, daughters, these characters collectively provide something for everyone to latch onto as they create some of the frankest discussion you will ever see on film. In doing so, the words avoid being gratuitously explosive, instead casually fitting into the ongoing events, as though the sometimes shocking statements are just normal conversation. In fact, I don't think it uncommon for many of the words to be spoken or pondered in private daily interaction. However seeing and hearing them emanate from the big screen is an entirely different beast, as the movie elucidates many of the thoughts and words nobody will publicly claim.<br/><br/>Addressing touchy issues is a dangerous venture, but one that ultimately rewards more than restraint would have. Race and racism are the explicit themes that have garnered headlines, but beneath it all lies anger. One character poignantly comments on waking up angry for no apparent reason, and that is the root problem that lingers both within the film and within the viewer. Leaving the issue at racism (etc.) would have made for a decent film in itself, but pushing one step further thematically does likewise with the film, making it that much deeper, like the conversations you can have with a close friend as opposed to a casual acquaintance. Mix in the always potent themes of family, life, and death, and you have a film that at some point strikes to the very core of anyone.<br/><br/>The power of ""Crash"" stems from that introspection it triggers, encouraging the viewer to examine his own thoughts, motives, and reactions. This brings ""Traffic"" to mind, even though ""Crash"" lacks the powerful dramatic story arcs of Steven Soderburgh's work. The narrative here occasionally overwhelms emotionally, but does so inconsistently, perhaps because the constant moving between numerous tales slightly retards the emotion. From the intertwining story arcs to a song playing over the final act resolution to a strange something falling from the sky, the film most reminds of ""Magnolia"", but without any sort of emotional upswing at the end. ""Crash"" won't leave you feeling as optimistic, although it will make you think more.<br/><br/>Accentuating the penetrating narrative is the tight cinematography. Gone are most of the usual scene-setting wide shots, smartly and cleverly replaced by cuts that switch locations by using congruent shots, such as tight images of two separate people opening a door. Close-ups of faces and hands permeate the picture, subtly but greatly adding to intimate nature of movie, emphasizing the personal level at which the story best connects. Also enhancing the mood is the soft bluish color palette, similar to the also L.A.-based ""Collateral"". But instead of the slick high definition video dominant in Michael Mann's picture, James Muro's frequently hand-held shots are grittier, reflecting the coarse lives and thoughts of the characters.<br/><br/>Typical cinematic story lines need the questions raised within the film to be answered (ahem...""War of the Worlds""...ahem). Films like ""Crash"" excel precisely because they leave the viewer to ponder the posited questions. Equal parts social commentary and observation, this is one of the more daring films of the last few years, Bottom Line: If you take the chance to see it, properly prepared mentally, you won't be disappointed; you will be pleasantly surprised on numerous levels. 8 of 10."
"Jonny_Numb","6","0","3","6 October 2005"," well-done, but beats you into a corner with its ""message""
","Bearing no relation to the David Cronenberg film of the same name, Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" is a button-pushing film that shoves race discrimination in the viewer's face in a way that is both admirable and off-putting. When dealing with such issues, filmmakers tend to shroud themselves in a protective cloak that makes them invincible from negative criticism, as those who criticize, without careful justification, can be painted as being as racist as the characters in the movie. My central objection comes in the form of the sledgehammer subtlety with which the issue is presentednot that it doesn't deserve addressing in such a waythat causes the film to reek of ""Oscar consideration,"" and thus removing some of its authenticity. Thematically, the extensive ensemble cast linked by scenes of racism that change their perceptions (a DA and his wife are carjacked at gunpoint; an Iraqi store owner is robbed; a black director releases his pent-up fury after witnessing his wife being molested by a corrupt cop; a detective investigates the murder of a young black man; a rookie policeman is hardened by two notable racial encounters), and the stories and the resulting fatal ironies that occur are well-done, with spectacular performances all around (Matt Dillon as a racist cop; Ludicrous as a paranoid petty criminal; Sandra Bullock as the DA's wife). Unlike 2003's ""21 Grams,"" which also presented moral and emotional quandaries with the intent of telling a story from three equally-explored viewpoints, ""Crash"" is more prone to contrivance (that cop's demeanor really shifted drastically), especially when put against the gimmicky framework of a single ""day in the life,"" which leads to plot developments that seem forced and inauthentic. Still, almost in spite of its overwhelming good intentions, ""Crash"" is compelling, unpredictable, and well-performed. It will provoke discussion and linger in your mind, which is an achievement in and of itself."

","Thirty minutes into 'Crash', I was slightly put off and irritated. And at the time Don Cheadle's character insulted his girlfriend/partner's culture, I was about ready to stop viewing. The film's premise seemed to me outdated, outlandish, and just a bit naïve.<br/><br/>But I stayed. And I stayed primarily by accepting this film not as an indictment of America, nor as a primer on race relations in California, but as a movie about jerks  plain and simple. White, black, yellow, and brown jerks (well, maybe not brown - I can't remember any egregiously bad behaviour from that group)  all of them flawed, and all of them human. And by staying, I was able to actually say I found the film entertaining to watch, with several well thought out points to make. Moreover, I thought all the actors were realistic, and the story never dragged.<br/><br/>While several of the vignettes are pretty coincidental (you might say contrived)  the Matt Dillon/Thandie Newton one in particular  by and large the randomness of the characters' relationships works well. Paul Haggis, the writer and director of the film, does an excellent job of keeping the dialogue realistic, and the scene setup logical. And the music not only complements each scene well, but is evocatively apropos as well.<br/><br/>While I don't find its overall argument (which I think is 'you have no idea who you are, but you are racist') truthful, the movie did make you think. Also, unlike most movies today, this film is not forgotten two hrs after you leave the theater (or return the DVD in this case)."
"pkatzzz","4","0","7","1 October 2005"," Diversity is great?
","Actually, I got something Completely different out of this movie than any of these reviewers did, and I'm not sure it was the intention of the writer/director either.<br/><br/>Every reviewer (here and the ""professional"" ones) seems to think this movie is an expose on racism in America, and how we shouldn't judge each other on skin color alone. But the truth is that the clash (or crash, if you will) between races is NOT based merely on differences in skin color, but in our different CULTURES, which are merely represented by people with different skin colors, eye shapes, hair textures, etc. The topic of multi culture clashes is never addressed anywhere because we're all expected to love the idea of multiculturalism.<br/><br/>However, this movie, probably unintended, presents a much more realistic view of the results of vastly races, and subsequently cultures and cultural values, living among each other...Racism, or the belief that one race is inherently genetically superior to another, is not the real problem facing the people in this film, or in life. Problems don't happen between races because they have different skin colors- problems happen when different races have different and conflicting cultural values, as those ingrained values affect each race or ethnic group's perspective on life, work, family, leisure, how they raise their kids, how they view money, self-discipline, sexuality, morality, work ethic, etc. The skin color of a white person isn't the major factor which differentiates him from a black person - the value system that he is raised with does. <br/><br/>Why is it that when a black person succeeds in a so-called traditional white man's world, is he then ostracized by those blacks who intentionally segregate themselves from whites? It isn't because his skin has turned white, but because he is now seen as embracing the VALUES of white society, and therefore not really ""black"" anymore. <br/><br/>So, it's not really about being ""black"" or ""white"" skinned, it's about ""black culture and identity"" vs ""white culture and identity."" The same applies to other races and ethnic groups - each one has it's own identity and cultural values - which again, we're supposed to embrace. But, let's face it people: many of those values CLASH harshly with each other, and soon, you have a balkanized society -especially when each culture - and consequently, each value system - is supposed to be valued and tolerated equally. Well, that's nice and dandy in theory, but in reality, it doesn't work. I think this film illustrates that: we can all sing ""We are the world"" all we want, but in day-to-day life, it's unrealistic to expect that I'm gonna be OK with your values that I think stink, and that you're gonna embrace mine. And by suppressing our resentment that we aren't SUPPOSED embrace or value our cultural values over others (especially if you're white) or even recogognize they exist (!)Largely due to such artificial and suppressing devices as political correctness and diversity training, the anger is growing and growing and will be exploding in more situations in our ever increasingly diverse society. At some point, it will become more and more common for people to stand up and scream out: ""Goddammit! I'm sick of being told to tolerate and embrace your Third World cultural values when my values are what made this country great! Your people are bringing us all down, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"" <br/><br/>It's complicated folks, and the more we have varying cultures living together - and the more we ignore the harsh implications those differences bring to the table - the more our varying cultures - and races - will clash."

","This is a compelling movie where the cast of characters maneuver like dodgem cars as the story lines bring them into direct impact with one another. Set in Los Angeles, the multi-ethnicity of the characters and the associated stereotypes challenge viewers to grapple with provocative comments about how power is exercised and negotiated in a social environment where there is no black and white, only shades of gray. Heroes turn into villains and vice versa as viewers are challenged to take sides, then eat humble pie. Don Cheadle and Matt Dillion deliver thoughtful performances, while Sandra Bullock appears a little out of her comfort zone playing a character who is hostile towards a world that leaves her afraid to walk down the street at night. Perhaps the movie can be criticised for biting off more than it can chew. There is overt dialogue which pontificates about certain aspects of ethnicity and social justice. This leaves the audience with a feeling of 'so what'. Despite this, the movie is well worth a look."

","...know that you will be manipulated severely as a viewer. Normally, I don't mind being jerked around emotionally by a film if a) I know beforehand I'm in for it, and b) the manipulation is based on believable plot points. That's where most of this films adherents and I depart company; I felt only about half of the director's attempts to pull me up short actually worked, for me, anyway. I need to say right here, though, that this film should be seen, if for no other reason, than its clear message on how subtle racism creeps into all our live, and the toxic effect it has. That, for me, was the movie's redeeming virtue. On the downside, I ended up saying ""I don't think so"" once too often for my comfort level. For instance, when the Iranian shopkeeper fails to have his door fixed and instead yells at the Hispanic locksmith about being ripped off, and then (after having his shop vandalized) gets zilch from the insurance company because he didn't follow the locksmith's advice? Please. This guy struggles to leave Iran and scrapes together a business in L.A. and we're supposed to believe he won't walk to the back of his shop to see what the locksmith is telling him is wrong with the door? I hate it when directors do that, ask us to accept a completely unreal situation so he can then move us on to the resulting crises, which is supposed to evoke sympathy for the characters involved. This film, unfortunately, has more of these moments than is good for it, and by the end it pulls what could have been an excellent film down to being just a good one. The acting all around is first rate, especially that of Matt Dillon. Bottom line: see it, but the more slack you can cut the director, the better you'll like it. I just couldn't cut him that much."

","I was prepared not to like this film, since I usually dislike films that have received a lot of acclaim, finding them overrated. However, I found this film surprisingly interesting, if not flawless. Ludicrus put in one of the best performances I felt, presenting a fascinating character. Somewhere on this board a user suggests that his actions in the film are not supported by character development, whereas I would argue that the timescale of the narrative (which presents snapshots of interlinking lives over a controlled timespan, i think just a couple of days) precluded any real character development anyway; rather characters were shown to be multi-faceted at any given time. The character played by Matt Dillon was also well constructed and interesting. I didn't feel the film to be Hollywoodish, and was rather well put together. It was commendably open-ended, too, although I would balk at those who draw the simplistic conclusion that 'racism goes two ways' - racism has, in fact, a distinct and persistently meaningful cultural history that cannot be reduced to such a formula (racism has been used to exploit, enslave and murder on a grand scale and spanning centuries, and is not equable to xenophobia). However, if those who would draw comfort from said simplistic analysis spend time with this film, they could do far worse. All in all, an evening well spent at the cinema."

","This is what cinema is all about, a movie that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go even long after the movie is over. Hats off to Paul Haggis who wrote and directed (and who also did such a marvellous writing job on ""Million Dollar Baby"")it and with the help of Don Cheadle, who is one of the stars and producers, raised the funds for it and exercised artistic control all the way. And what a way. The characters are fully realized, multi-dimensional. One feels one knows a character (a white racist cop turns out to have a seriously ill father that he nurtures and cares for so tenderly)and then another dimension is added, the same cop risks his life to rescue a black woman from a blazing car crash. One never knows where the stories are going, down even to the very ending there are more surprises in store. In someone else's hands this could have been a wreck of a movie, the extremely racist dialogue would have been softened and blurred. But not here. I found it breathtaking that so many story lines were crammed into the movie,(and yes, there are some metaphoric levels as well which really work and some truly lovely magical moments) but the characters are engaging and real. A faultless cast who give of their very best, Tony Danza, for example, excels in a very tiny role, but he is only one talent of so many. Everyone shines in this and it is difficult to single any one out. In real life racism is all around us, vocalized often in the safety of homes, more often as a reaction to the unexpected: an accident, an imagined rip-off. This movie dares to go where no movie has gone before. 8 out of 10. Bravo and brava to all."

","What a good movie! Notice the use of good rather than great. I was really enjoying this one. There was a broad range of characters played by a more than able cast of varying experience and backgrounds. There were some great moments of dialogue, tension, humour and emotion where the audience were held at the edge of their seats, wondering if this time tragedy would strike. There was an intricate web of a storyline, weaving strands of interconnectivity to each thread of this tale of racism in LA and delicately pulling it all together. Alas it was in the drawing together of these tales that the film went wrong for me. Elements that had more emotional impact seemed to be finalized first, leaving more trivial, less weighty aspects to the very, very end which meant I was leaving the cinema not feeling very much about the whole thing rather than leaving with stronger feelings. It seemed to blow its load prematurely and a little reordering at the end would have made this a better movie for me. Despite this fudging, it's still one of the best movies in theatres at the moment and if you miss it there, do make a point of seeing it on DVD/TV."
"dromasca","8","0","4","5 September 2005"," A Los Angeles 'Wire' - good, but slightly over-rated
","'Crash' annoyed me to start from because it took the title of another film to remember by David Cronnenberg. It succeeds to be a different and interesting film however, so from now on we will need to say this 'Crash' or that 'Crash'.<br/><br/>The film is built as a puzzle of loosely coupled stories, around the theme of the attitude of common people in their approach to people belonging to other communities, in the multi-racial Los Angeles of today. The mix technique is interesting, although if you carefully analyze it we have already seen it used in other films, one good example being the excellent HBO series 'The Wire'. Each of the individual stories has a moral theme, based on how initial judgment and race-based stereotyping can prove to be wrong - in the eyes of the characters, but also of the viewers.<br/><br/>It's an interesting movie, although neither the script is that original, nor the racial theme approach is that crisply approached. It god very good critical feedback, maybe slightly better than it really deserves. At some points I had the feeling of manipulation, especially when world music was brought to help and channel feelings in the more pathetic scenes. Still, the overall sensation is of a well constructed puzzle, like life itself, or if you want like the diversified society it describes.<br/><br/>One final remark, the whole cast is very good, but Matt Dillon is the best in the role of a racist cop, who proves to be much more complex and very different from what the spectator may originally think."

","Crash was a very intense and interesting movie. I arrived about 10-15 minutes late, but sat thru the movie twice.<br/><br/>Crash is an interesting type of movie in the style of famous black movie-maker, Spike Lee. Several different racial and ethnic groups are portrayed in the movie, many of whom don't get along too well with others. These groups often intimidate and carp at one another.<br/><br/>Also portrayed are the officers of the police force on duty and off duty and the way they act toward the community and one another. For example, police Sgt. Matt Dillion insults and intimidates people trying to get help for his ailing father, who has prostate trouble. Another interesting family is the poor black mother who doesn't have very much food in her refrigerator. One son is a respectable police detective. The other son is a troublemaker and hoodlum.<br/><br/>The Persian family adds a lot of character to the film with father, daughter, and mother. The father and the daughter talking back and forth with one another is quite interesting. The Middle Eastern music in the background with the Persian family on the screen is quite good and intense. I'll look for the music on the internet.<br/><br/>Again, a very dynamic, well-done movie!"

Each section of L.A.'s vast community is examined from the rich politician and his wife, the Iranian shopkeeper, the Latin family trying to escape labelling of being gangster and down to the oriental white van man.<br/><br/>Interesting as it is, the stories aren't overbearing but as ever due to the many strands in the film they never seem to be able to fully examine the stories enough. Nevertheless, the general stories take twists and turns to keep your interest going and in this very difficult time of increased racial awareness it is a very relevant movie which is worth viewing. Likely will be positively noted in the Oscars, although i don't think that it is as good as that, but Matt Dillon will likely be given a positive nod for his portrayal of a bitter policeman for whom to there is more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Good intelligent cinema in a year of daft US nonsense, but nothing incredible although worth a visit to the cinema for."

Now, firstly, I gotta say that it was a million times better than ""Traffic."" I'd even go as far to say that it was along the lines of ""Pulp Fiction."" Maybe better, but ""Pulp Fiction"" had the comic strength to it. This movie was funny, really funny, but had a super dramatic feel to it.<br/><br/>""Unexpectedly funny,"" Entertainment Weekly says. They gave it an A.<br/><br/>~~ Don Cheadle plays a cop whose mother doesn't like very much. She likes her other son, who Don Cheadle is having to look for. That's his part. His partner, Jennifer Esposito plays someone he calls Mexican, which she corrects him on.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton plays a television producer's wife. They are pulled over by a cop played by Matt Dillon and his partner, Ryan Phillippe. Matt Dillon pulls them over for the husband, the driver, who is receiving fellatio from the wife. Matt Dillon pushes them against their car and frisks them for weapons. He does this to Thandie Newton and practically molests her, feeling her up. Her acting was really good, even though I don't like her crying face.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe starts out as this innocent kid. Turns into bold cop. Endsnot so innocent. He asks to be reassigned from a cop who gives interesting opinions on why he thinks Ryan wants to be reassigned. Matt Dillon is a racist cop with a father who has a urinary infection.<br/><br/>Sandra Bullock is a mean lady who doesn't know why she's mean. She sees some guy who looks like a gang banger changing the locks on her home. She asks for the locks to be changed again in the morning. This, of course, is after her car is stolen by Ludicrous. That's Ludicrous' part in the movie, and he tries stealing the television producer's car later in the film. Sandra Bullock, although we don't like her, ends up having one of the emotional scenes with her maid later in the movie.<br/><br/>My favorite story and character was about the guy who was changing the locks. He goes home and walks in his daughter's room, looking around. She's under the bed. They talk about how they moved out of a dangerous neighborhood and then the daughter admits to being afraid of the bullet that came through her window once. The father is such an awesome and nice guy. His conversation with his daughter made me want to cry throughout the whole scene. It was amazingly awesome and that scene alone made me love this movie. The father tells her a story about a fairy. Of course, the daughter doesn't believe in fairies. ""See, I told you you wouldn't believe me."" She tells him to go on with the story. The fairy brought him an invisible cloak that was impenetrable to bullets. Then, he passes the cloak onto her.<br/><br/>I think the last story in the movie was about a store owner who isn't very fluent in the English language. The character is introduced in a gun shop and he needs to buy a gun in case his store is broken into again. His daughter buys the bullets for him and chooses a red box. His locks (to his store) are changed by my favorite character, but his door is still too old. When told this, he doesn't believe it. That night, his store is broken into. He blames the guy who changed his locks. And he takes his gun and his bullets over to the lock guy's house.<br/><br/>My favorite scene: SPOILERS: Do NOT READ: (This is a must-see film): The lock dude comes home and then has a gun pointed in his face. ""I want my money back (from the locks I paid for)."" <br/><br/>SKIP: ""I have $50, I don't have all of what you paid fortake my wallet."" <br/><br/>SKIP: Inside his house, the daughter says to the mommy, ""He doesn't have it!"" The mom asks ""He doesn't have what?"" And the daughter runs out. Of course, it took Jake and me a while to realize that she was talking about the invisible cloak. She jumps to her daddy, and the store owner fires a shot. Such an emotional scene, seeing this nice guy hold his daughter and hearing the BANG! I wanted to cry so badly. Then the daughter says ""You're okay, daddy."" He checks herand she's fine. No bullet holes.<br/><br/>""Crash"" is, by far, the best film of the year 2005. It's about racism and stereotypes, yes. It is extremely entertaining and even thrilling. There are plenty of moments that get your heart rate going. And it's emotional. You care about each one of the characters, and they all play their characters very well. Tony Danza appears in a cameo, and he's good! Grade: A. Re-watch value: B (some may think it is too dramatic). This is currently my favorite movie ever. Currently. The music, though similar to ""Traffic,"" grew on me, and I decided that it was good and went with the movie perfectly."

Every single member of the massive ensemble impresses. The trustworthy likes of Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle do their best as always. New faces such as rapper Ludicrous deliver wonderful performance. Even Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser are superb.<br/><br/>What makes 'Crash' the film it is it's unflinching reality, it's constant ability to shock you, the way it forces you to question - and even change - your perceptions. It refuses to bow to fantasy. Even moments which seem fantastic at first turn out to be either beautifully scripted coincidences. No character in 'Crash' is exactly as they appear at first. They are multi-layered individuals, with their very own morals and motives. These morals and motives unfortunately lead to discrimination and bigotry in a number of cases. But never in the way you expect.<br/><br/>Uncompromising and highly intelligent, Crash is a motion picture which has something to say, but never what you expect. One of the films of the year."

Any film that has Don Cheadle getting laid has to be a good one, he wouldn't do it for Clooney, would he, seeing as he is a producer for this, and has someone believe that they were saved by an angel as he fired blanks has to be funny, sweet and well done, and the performances given really justify the intensity, thoughtful and damaging ideas with wit, integrity, and fantastic scenes of people of LA crashing as their lives touch in different ways to other cities. Brenden Fraser being able to get away with having a go at taking a photo, never taken, of him pinning a medal on an iraqi called Sadamn and not getting told off makes this racially confident and strong enough to cope with what is thrown at it.

","First of all, if this is an accurate depiction of life in LA, the movie compellingly makes me glad I don't live there! Fantastic directing, acting, writing, film editing, and storytelling! Don Cheadle is really becoming an acting juggernaut! One of Bullock's better jobs of acting too. The tension in quite a few scenes is nearly unbearable. A few flaws detracted from the over all experience for me, however. The opening premise does not seem to ring true. Although LA is different from some other big cities, in that direct contact between people is much more limited, the net effect in terms of hostility and crime is not all that different than New York or Chicago. The problem is more with big cities in general than with LA air conditioning and cars in particular. The other problem was with the Persian storeowner's irrational treatment of the Latino locksmith. He seems to speak English well enough in all the other scenes to be able to understand what the locksmith is telling him, but he acts as if he doesn't know the difference between a broken lock and a broken door. He showed no appreciation for the work the locksmith did at no charge. I also don't know what he expected to get from holding up the locksmith later, unless he though he was responsible for the robbery of his store. None of this was made very clear, although this storyline's crucial scene itself was an absolute corker, no doubt! A must see for 2005!"

I thought heh whats the big point? So that dude is black and that chick is white.. Come on guys, get along. Don't be such clichés.<br/><br/>But as the movie went on and I stopped wondering how it is possible that a bunch of people keeps on meeting each other again and again in such a big city as Los Angeles and realized that the movie is something like an oversubscribed analogy and that it really doesn't matter if the happenings are plausible, I started to compare that film to ""American Beauty"" in my mind. I guess it was necessary to show development in characters that in reality probably would take years. <br/><br/>After that I was very happy we went to see that movie. The message(s) of this film should be pretty obvious, so nothing to say about that.<br/><br/>Personally I really liked Matt Dillon's acting and finally I saw Sandra Bullock in a role that I liked.

","and the only time they come into contact is by crash'. And with these words Paul Haggis tears open the box of CRASH, one of the most searingly vital and important films of the year. This is a film that explores prejudice, racism, fear, hate, bigotry, random violence and all of those barriers we people of the cities have erected to isolate ourselves from the miscegenated world in which we live. In Haggis' hands every possible form of miscommunication based on ignorance and transference of self-loathing is woven together in a story that mixes Caucasian, African American, Asia, Persian, Hispanic conflicts and lifestyles and the concurrent disruption of world views gone wrong into a pungent story of tragedy and collision.<br/><br/>Every character in this well-crafted script eventually confronts every other character in ways that are at times coincidental, at times, tangential, and at other times the direct result of prior confrontations. African Americans bully each other over their own prejudices, Caucasians belittle their Hispanic workers and are the first to point the finger at the 'tattooed gangsters' who in reality are innocent tradesmen, Persians terrorized on their property immediately aim their hate at other minority suspects, redneck racist policemen thrash out at African Americans in response to their own personal family demons that have eroded their outlook and extend that venom to the most innocent of the rookie cops who metamorphose into like habits. Every form of prejudice and hate is encountered and none of the characters is free from being both the perpetrator and the victim. It is as though the Golden Rule of 'Do unto others as you would have others do unto you' has been hideously transformed into a reason for violence.<br/><br/>Each member of this extraordinary ensemble acting team is outstanding form those with the largest parts to those whose presence is fleetingly meaningful. And some of the actors heretofore know as B actors rise to the level of brilliance under Haggis' knowing direction. Matt Dillon, Ryan Phillippe, Don Cheadle, Terrence Howard (here is a star!), Thandie Newton, Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges, Larenz Tate, Loretta Devine (extraordinary!), Beverly Todd, Jennifer Esposito, Michael Pena (who delivers the most affecting scene in the film), Shaun Toub, Yomi Perry, Brendan Frasier, Sandra Bullock, Tony Danza, William Fichtner - indeed, the list of the entire cast should be included in the kudos.<br/><br/>People leave the theater stunned, tearful, informed, and incredulous, so great is the impact of this film. Much or that impact is aided by the brilliantly creative cinematography of James Muro and Dana Gonzales and by the powerful musical score by Mark Isham. This is quite simply one of the finest films of the year by anyone's standards. For those critics who descry Haggis' lack of providing 'Redemption' for the characters, this viewer would take offense: every character is altered either tangentially, directly, or referentially by the tightly woven tapestry that is CRASH. Recommended for everyone to see, internalize, and begin to make changes on our planet. Grady Harp"

","I saw this film over two months ago and it's still going through my mind. The main character is the Los Angeles I live in- most of us isolated in our cars as we travel though our daily lives on congested freeways and streets, inching slowly towards our destinations. Only when forced by the usual violent circumstances do we rub up against our varied ethnic communities only to realize how different we all are- and yet, as this film reveals, how similar our humanity is.<br/><br/>Crash is a great ensemble film, drawing together actors that give both subtle and dramatic life to their characters. Sandra Bullock for once reveals a dramatic edge to her acting ability, and Don Cheadle as always, shows his talent a hundred percent. The rest of the cast stands out in their ability to give this film not only the different contrasts between the characters, but also the thin gray lines that blur stereotypes. <br/><br/>Paul Haggis shows us how fear keeps us isolated, and yet how once in a while when it is called for our humanity brings us together to show how much we all share in common.<br/><br/>This film is helped out by outstanding camera work and a soundtrack that adds greatly to the emotions revealed in it. Although I have mixed feelings about recommending any movie (everybody has their own different opinions when it comes to watching a film) this is one film I feel moved to talking about to friends.

","When you bake a cake, you put all the ingredients into a mixing bowl, mix them all together, and then bake it. If you just have the ingredients and never actually mix them together before baking though, you're not getting a cake. 'Crash', to me, feels like just that; great ingredients, but nobody mixed the batter.<br/><br/>'Crash' has all the elements of a great movie. Great cast, great acting, great dialogue, believable characters and motivations, impressive cinematography, and a good director. But it just didn't quite 'gel' with me. It seemed like it was just a series of vignettes with barely developed characters and story lines, with a bunch of racist overtones to speak a message that's never quite clear.<br/><br/>Most of the characters were stereotypes themselves, nobody *really* redeemed themselves even though the stories made it seem like many of them did, there was never any closure in the majority of the stories, and everything was just a bit too coincidental to seem as realistic as the movie was supposed to be. All of the characters would show up again to affect another character in the story, which would then affect another character. For a movie that's supposed to portray gritty realism, I certainly found myself thinking ""What an unlikely coincidence"" very often whenever a character would show up again later on for a dramatic third-act plot twist.<br/><br/>I think a TV series with maybe one character's back story focused on per episode (for example, the same format as ABC's ""Lost"") would've worked better. But there really was never a full, coherent story in this movie, nor was there ever a clear message. It just seemed like they wanted to pack way too much into two hours, and for me, it fell a little flat.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing for the fantastic performances (I never knew 'Ludacris' could act, Don Cheadle is excellent, and even Ryan Phillipe surprised me).

Some characters undergo VERY cheesy epiphanies, the rest though stay pretty much exactly the same. Sandra Bullock's role in the movie was so pathetically one-dimensional it's a wonder it wasn't cut.

","Written and Directed by Paul Haggis (writer of Million Dollar Baby) and starring an ensemble cast that includes Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle, Matt Dillion, Michael Pena, Thandie Newton, Terrence Howard, Brendan Fraser and Jennifer Esposito.<br/><br/>The movie is set in Los Angeles and presents several interconnected vignettes of contemporary life (over a day and a half) filtered through the lens of racism and several derivatives. <br/><br/>The movie will deservedly face a barrage of criticisms, chief of which is its ability to manipulate the audience to a state of being very unsettled. This is done using a series of observations and it works well. However, given how they are intensely dramatic and thematic, are these observations realistic? <br/><br/>This notwithstanding, the movie's thematic elements get the message across: racism, stereotyping, class lines, all result in faulty human communication and interaction. The film rolls along quickly advancing whether you recognize it or not, everyone is affected. <br/><br/>The entire cast is superb, probably because of their belief in the material and Haggis' command. However there are a few stellar performances, most notably: Matt Dillion, Thandie Newton, Michael Pena, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Ryan Phillipe. The ""Crash"" moments of these central characters (always two-sided) are very well executed, despite the fact it personally ached to watch at times. <br/><br/>The film employs Los Angeles like Michael Mann would do, establishing the city as a character. It is edited like a Robert Altman or Paul Thomas Anderson flick and Haggis takes his time in totally dismissing the notion of subtlety and clichés, resulting in heightened dramatic tension, even though on occasion, the narrative makes absolutely no sense. <br/><br/>These flaws are thoroughly excusable, because the movie has great ambition, intent and heart. It is one of those rare films that promotes discussion about a very real issue. Further, the presupposition that we all use these filters and that you really may not know yourself, cements the movie's poignancy when we realize the possible consequences of using them."

","I just had a delectable visual and mental treat from Paul Haggis. Crash, which opened in theaters on Thursaday, is a well-crafted story. From the opening scene of a car collision, the film unfolds to weave several stories to form an intricate web of inter-related events involving the beautifully drawn characters. The basis of the story might have been racial discrimination and stereotyping but beneath this surface, it's really an emotionally-charged collision of unearthed feelings, contradictive thoughts and the emotional freedom that people sometimes deny themselves by refusing to confront reality. There's a couple of heart wrenching scenes in the film too.<br/><br/>Although most of the actors have minimal screen time due to the various stories, the acting is consummate. Don Cheadle is shaping to be a great character actor as his display of emotions is so intense that you feel him. Ludicrous, the rapper (whose music I couldn't care less), also shows promise in his big screen debut.<br/><br/>For me, I identify most with Sandra Bullock's character, a heavily repressed and unhappy socialite who was robbed at gunpoint with her husband (Brendan Fraser). When her character said, ""I am upset but it's not because of the carjack. I wake up feeling like this every morning. I am angry but I don't know why."" And when she falls off the stairs shortly after, only to arrive at the realization of the people and things that matter most.<br/><br/>I am deeply surprised by how well the little stories intertwine so flawlessly to present a thought-provoking film. Certainly one of my three favorite movies of 2005 following Closer and Sommersturm (Summer Storm). I urge everyone to see Paul Haggis' Crash and experience 2 hours of feeling again."

","Let's take one of the most obnoxious characters; Matt Dillon's Sgt Ryan. Not only does he stop people for no good reason, but harasses them sexually. He is a racist and insults people to their face. Yet he has a sick father who apparently can't afford medical care (at least until he has full-blown kidney failure.) He touchingly cares for him and at one point breaks down in tears. Should he be pilloried for being a racist? What is his problem? What theme runs through all the characters? Would Peter Waters and his friend steal cars if they had a car to begin with? Would Shaniqua deny medical care if medicine were free for everyone? Would the young officer have shot Waters in a panic if his tolerant views had been born out of social and loving experiences with black people, as opposed to theoretical, knee-jerk political correctness? Why is everyone so stressed out? There is only one answer, in my view. Capitalism diligently works to divide people and keep them helpless in the face of injustice. If Americans can blame ""the other-the black, the Mexican, the Iranian,the Asian"" then they don't have to consider that their lives are rat race, that they are unemployed or can be fired at any moment, that they can become homeless, that they have no medical care, that they have to toe the line against their better instincts or face the wrath of a corrupt system that demands corruption. None of these conditions are brought about by blacks, Mexicans, Iranians, Asians. They are brought about by the system, and the system is capitalist.

From the superficial exteriors of race, gender, dress and language, each character instantly judges the others out of context, usually to devastating consequences; the layers are pulled back as each is rubbed raw by their contact with the other.<br/><br/>Each action leads to unpredictable consequences that unexpectedly affect another person and no good deed goes unpunished. No one is left unscarred, though not everyone learns a lesson from their experiences, from the most naive (Ryan Philippe putting his preternatural baby face to good effect for a rookie cop) to the most jaded (Don Cheadle using a whole new body language than his other films for his police detective). Every character has flaws, either from their past or present, and almost none are quite the stereotype they seem at first, especially as each is pushed in unexpected directions to do unpredictable actions.<br/><br/>Virtually the entire ensemble is note perfect, particularly Terrence Dashon Howard as an African-American man who quickly adjusts (and misadjusts) his style to fit into his various social environments. Sandra Bullock has surprising dramatic authority, even if her character is less revelatory than the others, and Brendan Fraser as her husband has the only one-note of less credibility as a too young and too stiff district attorney.<br/><br/>The language is frank and lacerating in its confrontations, bordering on Mamet and LaBute territory for its bluntness about American society, but I never cry at those playwrights' works and I cried here out of hopelessness and despair.<br/><br/>Oddly, the soundtrack selections make little ironic note of the Christmas season setting, but there is some quiet commentary of each character listening to separate songs, such as hip hip or country, to subtly indicate the different musical environment they create around themselves (but not, Lyle Lovett's ""L.A. County"" though his music would have been more appropriate here than in ""The Interpreter""). There is also the ethereal world music that Haggis used similarly atmospherically in his groundbreaking ""E Z Streets"" television series.<br/><br/>I saw the film with an integrated, multi-ethnic audience in Queens, NY that in the first half reacted in turn in support of seeing themselves represented on the screen, but throughout the second half was dead silent. This film will make for good discussion groups, particularly in contrast to Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" as that phrase takes on many more layers here. I do wonder what input the cast had in the dialog; if Haggis had used a Mike Leigh-style involvement, such as with ""Vera Drake,"" the language could be assured of authenticity as well as electricity."

It is a great directorial debut that lingers on being a 2 hour non stop TV drama w/out commercials that tries to cover so many characters that one wishes Paul would have tried to provide more depth to less characters to enhance the message that feels like a roller-coaster always flying down at 200 mph... but at the same time the edginess and superficiality of this effect truly captures the essence of what it feels like to Live in LA..which could have been another title for it. Perhaps it is due to his background in TV that yearns to provide non stop drama with no depth of character so we wont switch to another channel at the commercial but that is a shame since he covers such wonderful subjects of racism,love and having faith in a system that is so devoid of it these days.<br/><br/>But besides this small exception the film delivers stunning acting, quick sometimes too quick of a pace that is so full of dramatic events that one can predict them but with such an all star cast one allows for such exaggerated coincidences to enjoy the insightful message that he keeps pounding thru our heads until the roller-coaster ends with a reminder that indeed.. we can keep crashing or perhaps not.<br/><br/>nobody could give away just one spoiler in this movie to ruin it but it surely will be a movie to be talked about for a long time and hopefully more films will follow in his footsteps to make a change and show how we can thru films of this nature.<br/><br/>Great job and i highly recommend it... but it isn't a light fun film so be prepared I give it an 8 with potential of a 10 next time"

It turns out that Ludicrous and Matt Dillon had greeeaaat performances as well as everyone else in the film. I was biased against Matt Dillon because of his work (or lack there of) in Employee of the Month. I just couldn't believe he would even agree to do such a horrible film. Anyways, back to my main point (if I have one). This movie was excellent and can apply to all of our lives. It was unexpectedly funny, but it was the kind of humor that you feel bad after you laugh because you know it's true. I had such a variety of emotions from all the culture-clashing going on. I felt like I got the crap kicked out of me during that film, but, somehow, in a good way. See this movie, it just might change your outlook on things. Don't write it off like I did, but open your mind and put yourself into, unfortunately, what could be just another day of ruthless experiences that directly and/or indirectly affect you each day. This film may seem all to real to you."
"Barky44","9","0","7","3 June 2005"," A Bold Look at Racial Perceptions
","""Crash"" could be considered as one more film trying to throw racial prejudice into our face. There have been many films out there that try to preach to an audience about racial intolerance in a bigoted America.<br/><br/>If you blow off this film because this is what you think it's about, you'll really miss out on a good film with good writing.<br/><br/>What makes ""Crash"" so good is it's the first film I've seen that really digs at racial ""perceptions"", not race ""relations"". After all, in life the perception comes before the relationship. The filmmakers recognize this point and go right at the heart of it.<br/><br/>We are shown an upper-class white woman see the Hispanic locksmith as a potential criminal. We see the Iranian shopkeepers treated as Arabs. We see the working woman accuse the Asian wife of not speaking English (to which the latter retorts ""I am speaking English, you :expletive:."" This whole film is like that: a myriad of differing viewpoints. The director changes viewpoints so frequently yet so flawlessly. He shows the world through black eyes, through white eyes, or through Hispanic eyes, all without confusing the viewer. But he doesn't stop there (that would stereotype far too much), he also manages to rotate through class structures, through religious beliefs, and through various degrees of morality.<br/><br/>If you allow it to happen, the effect is to alter your perceptions of race and humanity. There isn't only one view of the world (your own), there's billions of viewpoints, all as real as yours. This is real life (amplified for drama by the movie industry, to be sure, but real life nonetheless).<br/><br/>Continuing to mimic real life, there's no big story of racial tolerance in ""Crash"", no big ""group hug"" between the white man and the black man that redeems the characters in the end. Like a car accident, the participants fill out their paperwork and go their separate ways, never to meet again, never to learn anything from each other. Just continuing on as before. It's not the normal Hollywood ending, but it's by far a more honest one.<br/><br/>It may be far too much to ask of a film of this sort (it simply isn't a film for the masses), but hopefully a few people manage to change their own perceptions after seeing ""Crash"".<br/><br/>9 out of 10. There are one or two plot elements that are simply unoriginal (""I need to shake hands with a black man to get elected"" -- oh brother), but other than that it's a very good film.<br/><br/>Barky"

","I, like most of you reading this comment, am a huge movie buff, but lately, I have been disappointed with the array of horrible movies in theaters lately, To me, Hollywood's movie scripts aren't what they use to be, BUT...I ain't here to bash on Hollywood, A few movies have rescued hardcore movie buffs like myself, ""Nobody Knows"" and ""Whale Rider"" are great independent films...a well written script for Hollywood to save us is all we need! Lets just say, this movie has saved us, many times over, the writing, directing, even a feeling of authenticity was renewed with this film, Not just a film on racism, but how small the world really is, everyone is linked, one way...or another, Powerful moments in the film made a non-emotional film viewer like myself buckle down and want to cry, This movie has easily made my top 10 list of best movies all time, and I am certain that it will rise upon your lists, If you are looking for a movie that will restore your faith in Hollywood, then this is it, thanks for listening, Mani p.s. before I watched the movie, I read the cast list, and I was surprised of some of the peeps they casted, but never the less, I was surprised more on an awesome job all of them did, even our friendly neighborhood rapper, Ludicrous."
"rebecca3725","9","0","8","22 May 2005"," another view of the melting pot
","disturbing, powerful but also, inspiring and redemptive, as masterfully made movies tend to be. A movie that confronts us with our stereotypes, prejudices, fears, and inner hypocracies. Beautifully crafted storytelling and compelling acting by almost everyone. The character development is superb. Haggis manages to weave the stories of 10 people with disparate lives into a fabric that exposes the myth of the urban melting pot.The theme-- that we don't know who we really are until our fears are staring us in the face--is brought out with subtlety, yet powerfully visualized on the screen. This is one of the most refreshing and best made movies in many years."
"bobbobwhite","9","0","8","20 May 2005"," Tough subject to get right; this film did
","Crash let us know right away that it was not going to be an easy film to watch, with the characters essentially fighting each other in racial struggles sometimes to the death. The racial struggle is still inconclusive in America, and probably in the entire world, and we still don't know for sure how it will turn out. Will we survive it? Crash tried to give us a hint of hope that we may.<br/><br/>Crash tried to show that even though some might fear or even hate others for being different than them, we still need each other often in order to deal with life's many issues and problems. That should be the lesson...we do need each other, and emergencies like those shown in the film are the great equalizers...we are all in the same need in those situations, no matter who helps us, and we should be very grateful to those who do help us no matter what their color.<br/><br/>Don Cheadle is rapidly becoming a star who takes over a film from other actors, even though most did a good job, especially Matt Dillon, Terrance Howard, and even Sandra Bullock who really surprised me with her ability. Cheadle was again wonderful as he usually is, and was very soulful as a world-weary cop with a junkie mom and criminal brother riding on his overburdened shoulders.<br/><br/>Matt Dillon's tough/gentle cop character showed the realistic changes a person can make when thrown into conflicting situations evoking the opposite emotions of anger and compassion...one time he was an angry brute bent on cruelty, the next time a gentle and compassionate rescuer of the same person he earlier brutalized. And he was a loving son too. Just like all the rest of us can be in different life situations.<br/><br/>Terrance D. Howard, who has a great face and looks a lot like a black Benicio del Toro, was a standout. He was an Oreo entertainment exec hot shot in the early going and he wimped out shamefully in a tough racial situation involving his wife and a white cop, but his character came through later with some real backbone when he felt pushed hard enough to take a stand against perceived racial profiling and persecution by the police.<br/><br/>Stereotypes are with us because, as shown in this film, a lot of them are based on truths or half-truths, but are just plain wrong when applied to individuals. Crash showed well how wrong all races can be by pigeon-holing others into convenient niches that fit their own built-in prejudices. Sometimes it even killed them.<br/><br/>Great night shots of LA and wonderful film technicals throughout, using very clever cutaways that seamlessly melded one scene's end into the start of a totally different scene. Very slick and effective. The only false stretch for me was that it is realistically an impossibility for all the different characters in the film to run into each other so often in 12 million-people strong L.A. That just couldn't happen, but it made for a very interesting and fantastic drama, if not always a totally realistic one."
"darthraider56","9","0","9","16 May 2005"," Get ready for roller coaster of racism
","This movie is an absolute must see. I didn't know much about it when I went into see it. The trailers for it were very obscure and didn't tell you much about the film. Trust me, this is a good thing. Because of this, you're not expecting the many twists and turns that will constantly bombard you through out the film. If you liked the pace of ""Snatch"", and the character development of ""Traffic"", this movie will definitely keep you engaged. Although this movie has many well known actors/actresses; including a very pretentious Sandra Bullock, a level minded Ryan Phillipe, that sleaze ball Matt Dillon, the gorgeous Jennifer Espisito, Oscar nominated Don Chedle, a surprisingly humorous role from Ludicrous, and many others, amazingly, no one steals the show. It seemed as though each scene was dominated only by the characters in it. This is what separates it from most other films. In a post 9/11 world, everyone is on edge when dealing with races other than their own. The characters are quick to judge others based solely on stereotypes they've come to believe. Racial epithets are used as soon as a character feels like they are being threatened, dis-empowered, or as a joke. The story carries on as each characters life intersects and affects another characters life and story. It was genius to place this movie in the epicenter of diverse ethnic backgrounds and clashing cultural encounters; Los Angeles. If anyone has seen ""Collateral"", you'll remember that one of the reasons so many of the murders in that movie were successful was that L.A. is such a disconnected city when it comes to socialization that no one cares what is happening in someone else's life. Although there is an overall sense of disconnectedness in the film, its funny how at the end, everything falls in place and you have come full circle. Another smart move by director Paul Haggis was not including any subtitles, this way only the specific culture in the audience who speaks the same language as the character will understand what they are talking about, just like in real life. This movie connects people.<br/><br/>Like many other pictures before it, Crash tries to illustrate to the audience what it feels like to be the minority. However, with this film, everyone in the audience is the minority. It doesn't leave anyone out of it. Black, white, brown, yellow,  Asian, Middle-Eastern, Latino, African; everyone steps into each other's shoes for 115 minutes. Just about any racial statement or stereotype is brought out in the film. There is no hero, there is no super-villain, there is not one character you absolutely despise, and no one you cheer for. Do not expect to come out of this movie anticipating someone has won a battle. No race comes out on top, it shows us how any race is willing to make judgments about others even if they have been oppressed before. It is also a film about redemption. By the end, of the film, a few people you wish wouldn't die, do, other who you wouldn't expect to do good deeds, do, others find redemption spiritually, and some find it through a friend.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, you better soon."
"rosscinema","8","0","6","16 May 2005"," Intrigueing look at racism in Los Angeles
","What this film does that others haven't in the past is have the subject of racism brought to the forefront from the perspective of all the characters and how small things that occur can have a major impact even with those who are not directly involved. Story is about how several characters living in the Los Angeles area deal with racism and how it effects their lives and everyone around them including a black cop named Graham (Don Cheadle) who is sleeping with his female partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) but has no idea of which Latin descent she's from.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Other characters involve a district attorney (Brendan Fraser) and his wife (Sandra Bullock) and how they deal with being carjacked from two black men (Ludacris & Larenz Tate) who have their own perspective of things. A white racist cop named Ryan (Matt Dillon) harasses a black couple (Terrence Howard & Thandie Newton) while his disgusted partner Hanson (Ryan Phillippe) looks on and an Iranian store owner has his business looted and blames the Hispanic locksmith.<br/><br/>This is made by Paul Haggis (Million Dollar Baby) who makes his directorial debut with this effort and not only does his script cover all the bases but his attention to detail is at times overwhelming. In my perfect film world this would be considered the normal attempt in making a film but instead audiences are used to wading through about 10 or so bad films before finally viewing something thought provoking such as this. As much as I respected this film I still came away thinking that it was flawed in some manner and I think what hurts this is that there is just too many characters and events being tossed at the viewer. Even so, Haggis's effort deserves praise not only in what he's trying to achieve but by pushing the right buttons and provoking the audience with a subject that (let's face it) makes everyone uncomfortable. Haggis has emerged as a true talent and an important artist and he seems to be one of those writer/directors who even if he fails he'll still create something that's worth everyone's time."

","I knew when I saw the previews for Crash, that it was going to be a movie that I would enjoy, but I didn't know how much. It wasn't even until the day before I saw it in theaters that I realized it was focused primarily on racism, nor did I know that it was being directed by Paul Haggis, the mind behind Million Dollar Baby. So, I went in to this one pretty open to anything that was thrown my way.<br/><br/>I won't spoil anything and I won't give a summary of the movie because enough people have done that before me, I will just say that from the opening to the ending, this movie grabs a hold of your throat and doesn't let go... forcing you to watch and listen as people criticize, call names, attack verbally and physically, people that they deem ""different"" and by the same token, inferior.<br/><br/>The thing about Crash that I think sticks out the most, is that anyone can place either themselves or someone they know in the shoes of anyone in the movie, from Bullock, to Cheadle, to Ludicrous, and even Ryan Phillipe, the one ""good guy"" in the movie. You can't help but put yourself in their situations and ask what you yourself would do and, by the same token, what you wouldn't do.<br/><br/>I will close by saying that people who can't handle racial slurs, foul language, and violence, probably shouldn't see this film, but at the same time I encourage everyone to see this film and embrace the politically incorrect reality of a movie like this that only comes along once in a couple years. Thank you Paul Haggis for making an entertaining movie that has a real message behind it, something lacking in most of the movies today."

"espector","6","0","8","9 May 2005"," Would have liked it better if it were twice as long...
","Crash takes on a number of important issues, though none that are particularly new to the screen. Though it attempts to deal with race in America in a provocative, original way, I left feeling like I barely new the characters in the film. This movie reminds me of a dramatic version of Love Actually - so many people, so little time. With half the characters I feel I would have gotten to know them better and enjoyed the picture more. The plots are interwoven in such a way that it really feels like you're watching a movie. A more realistic portrayal might have included more finely drawn personalities and fewer interconnected elements. Overall, an ambitious attempt at creating race dialogue that falls a bit short."
