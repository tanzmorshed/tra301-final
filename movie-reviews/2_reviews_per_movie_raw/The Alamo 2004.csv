","After writing a phd dissertation and spending months doing research on the Alamo at The DRT library and across Texas, I became convinced that I might not live long enough to see a theatrical release that would finally do the history justice. The IMAX Alamo film is very good along historical lines, but due to budget limitations not to mention physiological IMAX constraints, it did not capture the scope and depth of the event. But make no mistake about it - this Alamo film does both. The Alamo's major participants are three dimensional flesh and blood mirror images of those one will find in their diaries, letters, books and first hand accounts of those who knew them. Even the Mexican dictator, Antonio Lopez Miguel De Santa Anna, is no longer a cardboard demon - he anticipates what Mexico will become without the stern hand that must come down to crush ""the American pirates."" Also, for the first time, the Tejanos who fought against their brothers and sisters in the Texas cause are well represented. The battle sequences culled from Santa Anna's own battle plans and the accounts of those who carried them out and those who survived, leave no nuance to the imagination and vividly demonstrate that even a chaotic retreat can turn into an unmanageable enemy force, overwhelming the west and north walls of the Alamo. The bloodbath, fury, chaos and desperation pulls the viewer into the center of a swirling vortex of courage and carnage. Patrick Wilson is his superb as Colonel William Barret Travis, the defacto commandante of the doomed fortress. For once, the multi emotional Travis is captured with all of the guilt ridden memories of his humiliating trial in Alabama, and the indecision that plagues his early confrontations with his sceptical Texan force. The ennui and angst of command did take a toll. But Travis' courage and conviction converge in a heart wrenching moment in front of his command, making the case for death with purpose. Jason Patric makes one wicked Jim Bowie and the fact that the Congress of the U.S is still trying to unravel some of his land swindles initiated almost two centuries ago underscores his portrayal. Bowie's legendary prowess in brawling, bilking and beating those around him is well known and Patrick's every move makes you instantly and consistently aware that Bowie was every bit the bad ass. But Bowie was also a romantic of epic proportions and flashbacks to his tragic marriage to Ursula Verimendi give a poignant underpinning to his deadliness. Billy Bob Thornton steals the show as David Crockett - but then - how could he miss? As Dennis Quaid said; ""Billy Bob is David Crockett - A hillbilly actor playing a hillbilly actor."" Thornton's performance is staggering. A self proclaimed over achiever and withering self critic, Thornton understands the very human David Crockett of his autobiography and letters, juxtaposed with the Davy Crockett of legends. It is a harrowing performance - particularly when Crockett realizes the Alamo is doomed. ""David Crockett might drop over these walls and take his chances,"" he confides to Bowie. But Davy Crockett, the legend cannot. ""People expect things,"" he tells Bowie. ""I've been on these walls all my life."" There is a palor and sadness that is worked beautifully by the modest film score. The photography paints Greek tragedy. These were and are real people. Many, many fans of the John Wayne ALAMO miss the overblown (but fun) saintliness of the celluloid 60's epic.For some, THE ALAMO 2004 is filled with defenders who were too human, historical facts be damned. But when Micajah Autrey and David die, I couldn't help but feel the pain of retrospection they both felt at that horrible moment. Add to this a wealth of metaphysical angst that is a subscript of this masterpiece. Tejano Catholic Voodoo guarantees the time, place and purpose of Bowie's demise. ""Did it matter?"" a dying Bowie asks a doomed Travis. ""Buck's"" face is a mask of hope and despair. These men will die not knowing if giving their lives will matter to anyone but themselves. Director John Lee Hancock does a marvelous job with subtleties that encompass great portions of Travis, Bowie and Crockett 's personality in particular. Did Crockett intentionally hit Santa Anna's epaulet? A second viewing revealed a gold reflection in the pupil of David's eye as he fires. How did Crockett die? He dies going down swinging inside the Alamo Church - but you never see his body. He dies a second time as one who refused to surrender. But you never see his body. ...And in the beginning of the film as you see the bodies of the defenders being carted away, you see Bowie and Travis, but not Crockett's. The last scene of the film is not a replay of the Crockett fiddle scene. There he is, playing over a nighttime San Antonio, alone - with no one in sight - and Billy Bob's ""David"" satisfied and almost bemused face in the final scene. What a gorgeous shot and a perfect way of tipping the hat to legend as well as a establishing while questioning the nature of immortality. <br/><br/>When history is relevance and universal, what more could we ask? I feel for the people who made this movie. In this climate of blind nationalism - embracing history not despite of its flaws but because of them will not garner the recognition this film so richly deserves. There are those that truly appreciate your efforts and applaud you for THE ALAMO fim I've waited to see all of my life. This one like the real battle, will be remembered. Thank you so much!"
"tidepride","Null","209","244","11 October 2004"," Surprised at the negative reviews
","I've rarely been as surprised by the reviews I've read here - or disagreed with them more - than I was for this film. Most of the ones here are negative and call this film boring, poorly done and lacking in character development.<br/><br/>I am very easily bored. At just over 2 hours, I found this film captivating. Poorly done? John Lee Hancock's film is one of the most effectively produced I can remember. Not one moment of this film was shot on a sound stage. They took 50 acres in Texas and actually rebuilt the entire city of San Antonio de Behar and the Alamo and shot the entire movie in situ. <br/><br/>But the most amazing aspect of these reviews is the repeated accusation of lack of character development. I came away from this film understanding for the first time who William Barrett Travis, David Crockett, James Bowie and Sam Houston really were. The human underneath the legend as it were. David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) has a great line in this movie: ""If it were just me, simple David from Tennessee, I might go over that wall one night and take my chances. But this Davy Crockett feller - people are watching him"". Lack of character development? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The piece de resistance, though, and the one that made me take fingers to keys and write this review (something I almost never do) was the review which claims there was no tribute given to Tejano assistance in the Texas Revolution. Did this person see the same film I did? Or did he/she take a bathroom break every time Juan Seguin's character was on screen? The PRIMARY thing I learned from this historically accurate-as-possible-when-making-a-movie film was ... ta da .... the involvement of the Tejanos! I had never really considered before that there was a brother-against-brother aspect to the Alamo, but it was very implicit in this film.<br/><br/>Ignore the negative reviews, particularly if you are a history buff, and see this film."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","28","30","11 August 2011"," I think I will probably have to settle for what I am now.
","The Alamo is directed by John Lee Hancock, who co-writes with Leslie Bohem and Stephen Gaghan. It stars Billy Bob Thornton, Jason Patric, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, Emilio Echevarria and Jordi Molla. Music is scored by Carter Burwell and Dean Semler is the cinematographer. Story is a recreation of The Battle of the Alamo that ran for 13 days during the Texas Revolution of 1836.<br/><br/>On release it was met with disdain at worst, indifference at best, and now historically it stands as the second biggest box office failure behind Cutthroat Island. The pre release word of mouth wasn't good, and with ""difficulties"" of the financial and creative kind leading to Ron Howard leaving the directors chair-and Russell Crowe and Ethan Hawke bowing out of roles for two of the main characters, the film has never had an equal footing from which to try and sell itself as a worthy epic. Yet if there is a western styled war film most likely to improve with age, then Hancock's Alamo is it. You see, in time it's hoped that people can embrace that this take on the Alamo legend thrives on humanistic depth, telling it not as a ""hooray"" hero piece, but as it was, men doomed to die. And more pertinent, men who ""knew"" that in all probability, they were waiting for death to come.<br/><br/>Now that's a hard sell. It's highly unlikely that we will ever get an Alamo film to please everyone, because ultimately the story is a sombre one, an unforgiving 13 days of sadness and bitter disappointments. No matter how it gets dressed up, with Duke Wayne bravado or otherwise, this was a futile engagement. There's no chest beating stirring of the emotions for the outcome of this battle, for example such as the British being allowed to withdraw gracefully from Rorke's Drift, this is bleak history. It was a bold approach by Hancock and his team, to strip away the glitter and paint it in fallible humanistic greys. Heroic pop culture characters like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie are not defined by glory rah rah rah, but by being men dealing with the harsh realities of war as best they can. It's telling that when Crockett turns up at the Alamo, he is genuinely stunned to learn that the fighting is not over, his plans for a comfortable life in politics vanquished the moment he sets foot upon Alamo turf.<br/><br/>Hancock should be roundly applauded for having the courage to craft such an honest depiction of the siege, and it's not as if we aren't warned about it, either in history as fact, or during the downbeat opening five minutes of film! So a film rich with in depth characterisations, then, but also a picture layered over with considerable technical skill. Hancock himself only really misfires by having a tacked on coda that shows Houston defeating Santa Anna and gaining his surrender. Who made the decision for this ""uplift"" I'm not sure, but it feels forced and doesn't have the impact intended. It would have been more telling and poignant to just have a title card flash up to tell us that Houston defeated Santa Anna in 18 minutes. We don't need to see a hurried recreation, the sombre mood needed to be kept up right to the last end credit rolled. For that's the true pain of The Battle of the Alamo.<br/><br/>However, Hancock gets mostly great performances from his leading cast members (Thornton hugely impressive as Crockett) and shoots his battle scenes with brutal distinction. His overhead shots are superb, especially as the Mexican army attacks for the final and telling time. The 100s of soldiers swarming over The Alamo looks like ants converging on a desert oasis, the hopelessness of the defenders of Mission San Antonio de Valero is never more evident than it is here. Semler and Burwell aid the mood considerably. The former is inspired by much of the film being set at night, utilising fires and candle lights to enforce the shadows (of death) hanging around the characters, while the textured brown, red and yellow hues used for the landscape gives off a parched beauty that lends one to understand why these men fight for the land they occupy. Burwell scores it evocatively, where tender swirls of emotion sit neatly along side the more broad action strains of the brass variety.<br/><br/>The lavish sets and costuming, including some tremendous hats, are all good on production value, to round out a tip top production. It cries out for revisits by those who dismissed it so casually back on its release. Certainly I myself found it helped considerably knowing now that this was not some rousing spectacle, but that it's a detailed character story leading up to a sad and inevitable conclusion. That coda and some under nourished support characters stop it from being a fully formed classic from the genre, but that aside, it's still one terrific and thoughtful piece of film making. 9/10"
"renee-133","9","87","101","7 April 2006"," A very good film that did not deserve negative reviews!
","I really don't understand the mostly venomous reviews for this film. It was the most historically accurate film ever made on the subject and the acting, for the most part,was exemplary; although, I must admit it is far from my favorite performance by Quaid. But Thornton, Patric, and Wilson were tremendous; I cannot imagine anyone else playing those 3 roles as well as they did! It is a sad commentary on the preferences of our society in general when a film this good and on this type of subject does so poorly. I hate to pose this question, but could it be due to a Texas/war backlash due to our current administration and the Iraq situation? Or as a movie-going public, do we prefer to be ""dumbed-down"" these days? Anyway, I highly recommend this film!"
"ma-cortes","7","20","21","24 July 2005"," Interesting rendition of the mythic Alamo mission with impressive battles
","Epic western upon the state of Texas's fight for independence in 1836 . The usual band of diverse personalities including Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thorton) , Jim Bowie (Jason Patrick) , Colonel Travis (Patrick Wilson) defend a small fort against very big Mexican raiding party commanded by general Santa Anna (Emilio Echevarria) . It's until the spectacular crushing spotlight of total slaughter and revenge executed by Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) when the movie comes alive at all . Previously meeting final tragedy , they contend with each other and finally understand the meaning of life and come to respect each other . It was a troubled issue but with millions dollars budget weighing heavy in the conscience of the producer Ron Howard and director John Hancock led to a real flop and didn't had the wished box office . Big budget production features an impeccable musical score by Carter Burwell and Billy Bob plays the violin , besides it has an incredible number of extras for the Mexican army . <br/><br/>The film is correctly based on historic events . The stalwart but tragic defense has become one of American history's most often repeated legends,although historical research has revealed a few facts that go unmentioned.For instance,Sam Houston,commander in chief of the Texas forces,never felt that the crumbling mission could stand up to a siege,and ordered frontiersman Jim Bowie to destroy.He didn't ,however,and rescinded the order and sent attorney turned colonel William B.Travis to defend it.The force that remained in the mission the date the siege began,is estimated at between 182 .Of these less than 20 were actually Texans,the rest including Bowie and another frontier legend,Davy Crookett were volunteers.Early all of them believed that reinforcements were only a short time away.Santa Anna Launched a pre-dawn attack.To the strains of ¨deguello¨a battle march indicating that no quarter would be given,or no prisoners taken,some 1800 Mexicans troops stormed the fort.They were thrown back by the cannon and rifles of the defenders,they rushed again,and were repulsed a second time.Eventually Santa Anna sent another wave of troops who broke the outer defenses and forced the Texans to retreat,fighting hand to hand.When the fighting was over,there were no survivors among the defenders.The myth that the garrison fought to the last man ,however isn't quite accurate,since the evidence indicates that Davy Crockett and several others were captured and possibly tortured,then executed.That they died bravely has never been disputed.William Travis who at least according to legend,invited all who would stay and die with him to cross the line in the dirt,fell near a cannon at the north wall.And Jim Bowie,already deathly ill from a sickness that had recently claimed wife and children,fought from his sickbed near the main gate.Like many others among the defenders Bowie was armed with the formidable hunting knife named for him.The legendary defense served as a rallying point for the beleaguered Texas.Although Santa Anna ,who lost at least 600 of some 3000 troops against a force of less than 200,referred as a small affair,the valor of the defenders gave the surviving Texan troops something to remember and thus they did,six weeks later at San Jacinto,but a new battle cry had been added to the annals of American history:¨Remember the Alamo¨"
"wforstchen","9","66","77","11 May 2005"," This historian loved it
","I was definitely part of the Baby Boomer Davy Crockett phenomena. Heck, I actually won a contest of Davy Crockett look alike when I was four years old in Newark NJ, and as I look back, I believe that wonderful and completely fictional television series by Disney, helped to trigger my interest in history, which has been my career now for over thirty years, starting as a middle school teacher and now a college professor, along with a number of books published.<br/><br/>I eagerly looked forward to this film's release and I regret now, that for one of the few times in my life I listened to critics who absolutely trashed a film so that I never went to see it on the wide screen. Made the same mistake with Blade Runner when it first came out!<br/><br/>So it was wait until Starz picked it up and frankly, I was blown away. I actually went out the next day and rented the wide screen DVD version to check it out more closely and will definitely buy it, I love it that much.<br/><br/>This is the best of all the attempts to tell the story of the Alamo. Sure, I grew up on the Crockett and Alamo legend, but I also got a healthy dose of cynicism about the whole thing when examining it from the Mexican perspective, particularly in relationship to the slavery issue and the promises made and broken by Houston and Austin to the Mexican government. This film, though it dances more than a little around those issues still at least touches on them.<br/><br/>But what really caught me was the attention to historical accuracy in relationship to the battle itself. I'll claim that for the first time every, a film captured the ""feel"" and truthful presentation of late 18th and early to mid 19th century linear warfare. Other films always make it look absurd, but here you see how it did work, manuevering masses of troops up to then deliver terrifying volley fire at close range then charge with the bayonet.<br/><br/>The weapons and how they were used was dead on perfect, right down to the use of canister by the artillery and regardless of what one critic said about shells, they were indeed used and the incident with Travis and the spurting fuse was perfect. Formations, volley fire, skirmishers, the awesome and terrifying Mexican pioneer troops, whoever was responsible for the setting and staging of this battle did a brilliant job. The set was perfect as well, down to the finest detail. The cinematography as well, especially the stunning scene from a high angle shot, the charges coming in from all sides at once, the defenders getting overwhelmed.<br/><br/>I'd rate this movie up with Zulu as a film about a small determined garrison standing against impossible odds, which is a great archetypal story.<br/><br/>In contrast, ""Patriot"" which drew so much critical acclaim was absolutely gut tearing, in a nauseating sense, when it came to any semblance of historical accuracy regarding battle and every year now I have to deprogram my students regarding its retched attempt at showing what Revolutionary period warfare looked like. For that matter I'll put Gettysburg and of course Gods and Generals in the same miserable league.<br/><br/>I do not understand why so many critics are trashing the acting and casting. Bill Bob Thorton and Jason Patric are superb. I was awed by Thorton's approach to the legendary Crockett character. Much of what was and still is believed about Crockett is all myth (and yeah even admitting that breaks this Baby Boomer's heart). Crockett was a character created by American theater and the first of the nickel and dime novels of the 1820-30s. He was something like a Schwartznegger cult character for his time, even while still alive, but his exploits were all legend. Thus the stunningly truthful scene of him confessing what really happened in a fight against Indians, the incredible acting when he kills, almost by accident, a Mexican soldier and you immediately sense that this is the FIRST man he has ever actually killed and he is horrified by it. . .and how in the end (SPOILERS AHEAD) he is trapped by his own legend into becoming a hero regardless of his fears. A historian that I studied under in graduate school wrote about the Alamo and was the first to tell me that Crockett, according to Mexican sources, survived the fall of the garrison and was executed after wards. I remember not wanting to believe it (Baby Boomer here, remember, Davy Crockett went down swinging). The debate varies, did he willingly surrender and beg for his life, was he wounded, overwhelmed and then executed. . .we will never know, but the screenplay does address it, and does it well.<br/><br/>A fictional scene undoubtedly, but still profoundly moving, Crockett playing the violin during sunset of the final night of siege. A beautiful scene that is haunting.<br/><br/>In closing, my thumbs up as a historian for this work. It is not a film that many would care for, no love interest, no ridiculous heroics, no Mel Gibson trying to do a Daniel Day Lewis, then sweeping off the girl in the low cut bodice after slaughtering a plentitude of foes, just a gritty, straight forward war story that is profoundly moving.<br/><br/>Only negative. The perpetual scowl of Quaid as Houston. Though his big final scene, the Battle of San Jacinto, is darn good as well, especially when done through the POV of Sequin, and the terrible dilemma faced by Mexican-Texans fighting on the Anglo side."
"ellisa","10","162","198","6 October 2004"," Excellent film that stands up to stupefying rancor
","Having kept an eye on this film since before it began production, I have been amazed at the viciousness of the invective that has been hurled its way. Reviews, both professional and amateur, have tended to offer viewpoints whose stunning ignorance have been nearly matched by their astonishing arrogance. This film has suffered much at the hands of pencilneck journalists who just couldn't wait to write some endlessly clever variation on 'forget the Alamo.' Precious few, Roger Ebert chief among them, seem to have understood the film. <br/><br/>Much of the vitriol is because it is a Disney film; while much is because it has to do with Texas. Both, largely because of their successes, seem to attract critics who allow decency and fairness to fall victim to their vindictiveness. I fear, however, that we live in such a cynical age, that the notion of men voluntarily giving up their lives in defense of freedom is so difficult to comprehend that it is met with derision. <br/><br/>Disney did not help matters with their poor handling of this film's publicity. I attend many movies, and I saw the trailer once. Where was the media blitz, as Touchstone did with Ladder 49? A predatory press gleefully playing up pre-release difficulties was met largely with silence. Disney seemed to have had no faith in the film, or at least no clue as to how to market it. Their loss. Literally. Fortunately, their campaign for the DVD was somewhat better. <br/><br/>As for the film itself, it is the most historically accurate version of the Alamo story  though that isn't saying much. For those for whom historical accuracy is a litmus test, there is still much over which to nitpick. But, as is the responsibility of a popular culture interpretation of historical events, director Hancock fully captures the spirit of what was going on at that particular time and in that particular place. Hancock and crew did a stellar job in lovingly recreating the world of 1836 Texians  American and European immigrants, as well as native Tejanos  uniting in revolt against an oppressive regime in an effort to gain independence, as well as a sovereign government attempting to enforce law and order on its frontiers. The principals, the tempestuous Houston, the celebrated Crockett, the fearsome Bowie, and the young, unproven Travis are portrayed as real humans rather than as demigods. Each has his obstacles to overcome, and each shows significant growth as their fates are played out. For those who make the ultimate sacrifice, their heroism is made all the more real by this emphasis on their humanity. The actors, particularly Thornton in an Oscar-worthy role, as well as Patric, Wilson, and the marvelous Emilio Echevarría as Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, are to be commended for their interpretations of these enigmatic characters. A major bonus of the DVD is the commentary by professional historian Stephen L. Hardin and military adviser Alan C. Huffines -- particularly useful for those who cannot wrap their minds around the differences between popular culture, history, and art.<br/><br/>Hancock has provided us with a thoughtful, intelligent, deliberate, and often subtle film for adults, certainly an explanation for the film's lack of box-office success. Even Burwell's score suffers from these 'shortcomings.' Comparisons to John Wayne's 1960 The Alamo are as inevitable as they are pointless, but anyone expecting that film's heavy-handedness may be disappointed. It is like comparing 2004's The Passion of the Christ to 1961's King of Kings  they are not remakes, but variations on a theme, each with their unique points of view, merits, and shortcomings.<br/><br/>The film's biggest fault is that, even if one didn't know that it was cut by about a third by negative test audience reactions, it is still apparent that it suffers from these cuts. This is a complex, epic story that demands epic treatment. I abhor criticizing a film for what it is not rather than what it is, but I join many others in sincerely hoping that a director's cut DVD will be forthcoming, so we can see Hancock's vision as it was intended. Where do I cast my vote?"
"leadpoisonaod","10","68","80","26 October 2004"," Well Crafted Historical Film
","I saw this movie on opening day with high expectations. I am somewhat of an Alamo buff and wanted to see the event portrayed better than ever before. And it certainly was. The historical aspect was perfect. I've read up on the Alamo before, and all the details were accurate: the clothing, guns, uniforms,the way the battle unfolded, and even the weather. The acting, especially Billy Bob Thornton's, was excellent. Almost Oscar worthy. The casting was just as good. Each actor fits their rolls with almost uncanny perfection. Although Hancock isn't quite Spielberg, he is exceptional because he did a good job on the film, and he put a LOT of care into it. (no props, stage lighting, a 50 acre set, not to mention historically perfect)<br/><br/>The Alamo is no doubt a controversial film. Those who slam it seem to revert to the fact that it should have been directed by Ron Howard, and been more gory, glamorized, and shouldn't have been so compressed (the original version was over 3 hours). More Hollywood, is basically what they're saying. It's these same people who compare it to John Wayne's version, saying it should have focused on artistic merits rather than history. Personally, I don't know if these people would know the whole PURPOSE of the Alamo if it ran over them with a steamroller. Hancock's vision was to make an Alamo that actually had some history to it. He wanted to tell the story right for once. The way I see it, The Alamo has as many if not more artistic merits of John Wayne's version, but adds historical accuracy and tells it true, without sacrifcing the drama. <br/><br/>The acting, casting, and directing are great, the historical value superb, and the battles (especailly on widescreen) are breathtaking. Sure, it would have been better with more scenes and blood, but this is the best Alamo movie I've ever seen, and a good film anyway. Not perfect, but pretty darn close. 9/10 Stars."
"Michaelrsear","10","28","31","30 August 2006"," Great Movie
","A truly great film. Sure it has flaws as does every film ever made, but nothing worthy of such criticism. To compare it to John Wayne's version is meaningless - both are good in their own way. However, this latest installment is by far the best. The pains the creators went through to be as historically accurate as possible is nothing short or great. This film was beautifully shot and had many great moments like the approach of the Mexican army during the final assault. When Billy Bob Thronton peers over the wall into the darkness and sees hundreds of Mexicans nearly at the fort's wall it's both chilling and wonderfully done - it is quite possibly one of the greatest scenes in movie history. What the real Alamo defenders really thought and felt at that moment none of us will never know, but how the film was shot gives us some basic insight into the terror they felt knowing they were about to die a violent and horrible death. And how can anyone be unmoved by Crockett playing his fiddle along with the Mexican army and then saying ""it's amazing what a little harmony can do."" Or when the spirit of Crockett plays his fiddle at the Alamo after being revenged. This movie is full of very well-done scenes and lines like this. I wasn't much interested in Billy Bob Thronton's work before this movie or even recall having seen him in anything, but he earned my respect with his performance - he was that good. But while Thronton stood out in my mind, each actor was great. The fact that the actors felt a strong emotional attachment to this film was obvious. Thus, how anyone can find fault with this movie is beyond me. It's a great film about great men (although flawed like us all) and the ultimate sacrifice they made. I find it very disappointing to read some comments which say, ""well, there wasn't enough action,"" or, ""the characters weren't well developed,"" or whatever; all I can figure is those people saw a different film or are trying to somehow convince us they have some sort of unique insight and to that I say BS. This is a high-quality film with high-quality actors that I consider one of the greatest films ever made. If you didn't like it then go back to watching garbage like ""Dude Where's My Car,"" or ""American Pie"" as you'll be better able to relate to that mindless crap. I guess a film that requires some thought and appreciation of great acting and production that doesn't rely so heavily on graphic violence, nudity, and gross filth, is beyond the intellect of today's average movie goer who will by contrast readily cite the unlimited virtues of such idiotic films as ""Jason vs. Freddy,"" or any of the 100s of B-grade garden-variety teen slasher flicks that totally rely on the big-breasted bimbos and blood-thirsty maniacs to sell tickets - who, even if by some miracle they were able to read this review still wouldn't understand what I'm saying. Thank goodness for movie makers who will risk ridicule to make a good film about something meaningful. Hats off to all of those who were involved in making the Alamo.<br/><br/>Michael Sear"
"jamesdavidson88","10","22","24","12 April 2004"," Good Alamo Movie
","I've read all the criticism associated with this film and I think some of it is a little unwarranted. As an Alamo buff my judgement of this film is definitely biased, but I will offer my opinion anyway. I think ""The Alamo"" is a very good Alamo film, definitely the best interpertation ever made about the epic battle. I loved John Wayne's film, but this movie has a more realistic approach. Some people criticize the film about certain scenes such as the Crockett's death, his fiddler on the roof scene and other tidbits that took place inside the Alamo compound.  Some people try to use those scenes as proof that the movie contains historical inaccuracies. The truth is there will never be a complete historically accurate Alamo film because we really don't know, nor ever will know what really took place. Any director is going to create his view of th battle. I also think is the best movie ever made about Crockett. Billy Bob Thornton captured the personality of the real Crockett. It doesen't matter if the fiddler on the roof scene never took place. That scene by itself captures the true spirit of David Crockett. A man that is more of an entertainer than wild frontiersman, an entertainer so talented that he can entertain the Mexican Army and temporarliy keep them from firing their cannons. We can see his charisma shine and we understand why he was probably elected to Congress. People make a big deal about how Crockett, Bowie and Travis died at the Alamo. Does it really matter? They were there until the end. Thats what counts. I do believe the movie could have been better. It definitely suffered from editing and even a little star power to carry certain scenes.  I think the director's cut will serve the movie justice and I believe over time people will have more respect for this movie. I don't beleive it is a perfect movie by any means at all. I do believe that it has much more to offer than what people are giving it credit. Again I'm huge fan of the duke, but I view his film as more of a John Wayne movie than an Alamo movie and there is nothing wrong with that. I just beleieve this Alamo is closer to the true story."
"cfo718","10","22","24","12 April 2004"," Pleasantly Surprised!
","I had been anticipating the opening of this movie for quite some time and saw it on opening day. I've followed Patrick Wilson's career go from Broadway, to small screen, and was excited to see his big screen debut. I was expecting the film to not be that good, just because of tired subject matter, directorial/actor issues, etc. but I absolutely loved it! Besides the beautiful set and costumes, the actors were great. The general of the Mexican army was positively sinister-such a wonderful interpretation and performance of that character! The script was really good, considering all that it had to tie together and communicate in a short period of time- both the battle scenes and normal scenes were woven together very well. It also had some great one-liners for unexpected comic relief- especially Billy Bob Thorton's character, Davey Crockett. And the music was fantastic! Maybe it's my down-home, Midwestern upbringing, but I thought it was really good and strongly encourage everyone to see it. Don't listen to bad reviews/people who haven't seen it/people who think only Texans like it/whatever...It's a great movie and worth the ticket!"

The 2004 film is called "" The Alamo "" the events concerning the battle at the old mission gets a face lift and some of the actual facts are finally included in the story. In this updated version, the hero of the Alamo, David Crockett is very ably played by Billy Bob Thornton. Taking a more modest approach to the actual figure from Tennessee, he allows the myth to dissipate and replaced with a more humble, introverted and practical character. Jason Patric plays James Bowie with a sincere sympathetic and vulnerable veiner which allows the audience to recognize the famous knife-fighter as a man conscious of his own mortality. Patrick Wilson is William Barret Travis, the prideful boisterous and often antagonistic lawyer given command of the tiny mission. With a handful of regular soldiers, he accepts the doomed post with the full knowledge his was only a holding action and without help not expected to hold. Dennis Quaid plays Sam Houston and seen as a self-determined leader of a republic torn from a poorly governed country. The fact of Crockett's death is as close to the literal record written by Jose Pena. The movie is structured well and when the actual facts are imposed, the fiery six hour assault, destruction of the crumbling adobe building and the killing of the all volunteer force of 186 men becomes a fitting tribute to the men and their cause. The reason why this movie will become a Classic will be due to the cast, it's director and the fact someone tried to tell the truth and that stands of it's own accord. ****"

","Excellent movie about Texas independence from Mexico and the heroes who made it happen!  Billy Bob Thornton was surprisingly good as Davey Crockett (I was interested in seeing this movie for that reason alone--I thought this was a funny choice but he was excellent in this role.  Jason Patrick also was good as Jim Bowie and Dennis Quaid proved once more to be a versatile actor by his fine portrail of Sam Houston.  I thought this movie was better than the John Wayne Alamo of the 1960's -more accurate in showing Travis death (a bullet to the head early in the final siege on day 13) and also showing Crockett's capture and execution (most historians believe he and a few of his men were captured and executed shortly after the Alamo fell.)  I also liked how the movie continued after the Alamo fell and told how Santa Anna was finally defeated.  It is a good family movie to see --very educational and historically accurate.  The critics have bashed this movie for reasons unknown.  Several people who left the theatre the same time as me said almost in unison -""I can't understand it, the critics ripped this movie and it was really good"" --The Alamo didn't concentrate on any one central character and didn't throw in a ridiculous love story to appeal the masses like ""Titanic"", ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Enemy at the Gates"".  I guess this is an essential element with today's critics because if a movie doesn't have it, the movie gets ripped!! --This movie deserves a much better rating than the expert critics gave it."

","For all the scoundrels & reasons for the Texan revolution, the Alamo was the price paid by them all & for it all.  Alamo IS the most accurate (historically) film made to date.  It showed all the warts of the founders of Texas & leading defenders of the Alamo, as well as the ultimate result, the massacre of those inside and the ruthlessness of Santa Anna.  Billy Bob Thornton played Crockett to a ""T"", he showed all the range of the man that ultimately had to live up to his own legend.  Most Texans will be disappointed in the land, power-hungry, drunken Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid), but he's there warts & all.  I think it had been better if Ron Howard had been the director, but Disney wouldn't let him do his way, and John Lee Hancock did well, just not excellent.  I'm Texan, born & raised, and this ain't no John Wayne movie, but for everything they took out to make it historically accurate, the things they put in made it a better and more passionate movie.  All Texans that watch will get that hitch in their hearts and maybe more non-Texans will appreciate where our pride comes from."

","Never have I seen so many critics duped by advance buzz or ulterior considerations (like politics or Eisner-related emotions).<br/><br/>This was an excellent movie.<br/><br/>Thornton, Patric and Wilson provide perceptive, subtle and realistic character studies of the three central figures of the Texian defense of the Alamo.  Thornton's ""David Crockett"" allows views to learn and like the historical figure, not the overblown and caricatured hero of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.<br/><br/>Apparently, many critics prefer hyped-up fantasy and action films rather than a serious effort to probe history.  USA Today spoke for them with a silly ""too true to be good"" headline.<br/><br/>The tragedy is not that the film is bad; the tragedy is that too many critics and too many movie-goers don't care about our nation's history and crave mindless escapism."

","I saw the Alamo and thought it was a fabulous enjoyable movie. The attention to detail made you feel as if you were living in Texas in 1836. The scenery was spectacular, and the acting was wonderful. Billy Bob Thornton played Davy Crockett as man, not a super hero. He was an ordinary man placed in an extraordinary situation. He did an excellent job.Jason Patric as James Bowie was wonderful, showing bravery while fighting illness. Patrick Wilson transformed William Travis from a hard nosed officer to a man who became respected by the Alamo defenders. Dennis Quaid was spectacular as Sam Houston. He showed the right amount of bravado, grit and determination needed to avenge the Alamo. Emilio Echevarria was a pompous Santa Anna, and Jordi Molla was Juan Seguin, a Mexican who supported the Texans. The movie had the right combination of drama and comic relief and the battle scenes were glorious. A must see movie."

Billy Bob Thorton is especially good as Davy Crockett. Some of the people who write bad reviews about this movie really don't know jack about what they're saying. There is nothing wrong with it.

","Having seen ""The Alamo,"" I find it hard to understand that the movie was a box office failure. Of course, if you're looking for naïve, overly emotional patriotism, you're in for a disappointment. But it's precisely this more nuanced approach which makes ""The Alamo"" great. It's not a movie that's driven by the Puritan/Manichean urge to make every American with a gun into an unqualified knight in shining armor, or rather into a cowboy who always wears white.<br/><br/>There is no doubt in ""The Alamo"" that the Texans were right to reject Santa Ana's (Antonio Echevarría) centralist constitution, and they were  as they were right some 20 years later, when they rebelled against another President's attempts to mar state rights. There is also no doubt in the movie that those roughly 200 defenders who held the Alamo for two weeks against a daunting force of 7000 were heroes, and they were. There is thirdly no doubt that their leaders Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) and Bill Travis (Patrick Wilson) were heroes.<br/><br/>However, the movie shows these main heroes  and Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid), who later defeats Santa Ana at San Jacinto  as each having a dark or at least problematic side to them. Houston is an alcoholic, who has to battle incompetent, bickering Texas politicians in order to raise an army to relieve the Alamo. Crockett feels under pressure to permanently live up to his rough, strongman persona, a persona that doesn't adequately respect every aspect of his personality. Bowie is an insubordinate criminal, who suffers from tuberculosis. And Bill Travis is basically a greenhorn who is simply not up to the task of commanding the garrison. To make matters worse, Bowie and Travis initially quarrel about who's in charge, a quarrel that is only stopped from getting physically by Crockett's intervention. Further, Crockett and Bowie own slaves, who are rightly questioning the wisdom of helping their masters defend the Alamo, since Mexico had already abolished slavery at the time.<br/><br/>It's great that the movies shows us that these men fought valiantly not because of their impeccable characters and unlimited morality, but despite their personal flaws. They pull themselves together, they put up a good fight, and they buy Sam Houston the time he needs to raise the army he later used to defeat Santa Ana decisively. Needless to add that the battle scenes are spectacular, but they're not obtrusive since much of the picture consists of meaningful dialog, which isn't always a given in a war movie."
"djy72","10","23","26","24 December 2004"," Best Alamo movie ever made!
","As a student of Texas history, I can tell you that there are few areas in which this version steps wrong. Great care was taken to get as many details right as possible. If you want to know what happened with these events, watch this version...DO NOT watch the 1960 John Wayne film!!! Just about the only thing that version got right was having the Alamo located in Texas...other than that, Wayne's version was a total work of fiction. It seems the 2004 version at least made an effort to talk to historians. Now another reviewer here complained this one seemed to much like a History Channel documentary...I wonder if that guy has even been to Texas? I'm from there, and the locals are fiercely protective of this period. They want to see it done right. This one does it right. On top of that, it has some very imaginative shots, like the ""you are the cannonball"" scene (you see the cannonball get fired from a cannon and fly towards its target as though YOU were stuffed into--and fired from--the barrel yourself). The performances were great all around, but mostly, I'm just grateful they got the details right."
"cariart","7","85","107","11 April 2004"," Flawed but Entertaining Epic...
","John Lee Hancock's THE ALAMO is often sluggish, mired in his effort to provide 'detail' in an attempt at honesty, and it is nearly 90 minutes before action fans get their money's worth (and they do; the Alamo's siege and 'last stand' are mesmerizing), but all that being said, the film is a remarkable re-evaluation of one of America's best-known legends.<br/><br/>While each of the story's principals (David Crockett, James Bowie, William Barret Travis, Sam Houston, and Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana) are de-mythologized, it is Crockett (brilliantly conceived by Billy Bob Thornton) who captures and holds your attention. Neither the folksy backwoodsman (as portrayed previously by Fess Parker and Arthur Hunnicutt), nor the hero answering an oppressed people's call for help (John Wayne's 'take' on Crockett), Thornton's Crockett is a well-dressed country 'sophisticate', who plays the violin and the political game in Washington very well. As the film opens, he attends a Washington production of ""The Lion of the West"", based on his fictional exploits, with a leading man dressed in what we today consider the 'Official Crockett Uniform' of buckskins and a coonskin cap. The character on stage, and the legends surrounding him which would ultimately incorporate the Alamo as it's final act, is the 'DAVY Crockett' we all know, but the 'real' David Crockett, according to Hancock, is an opportunist who sees political rebirth in Texas, and arrives hoping the battle is already over. Thornton is masterful, showing Crockett's ambition, his fear of having to 'live up' to the legends surrounding him, and his gradual emergence into a true hero, who would defy Santa Ana with his last breath.<br/><br/>The other leads aren't given as much screen time for character development, with the exception of Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston, a heavy-drinking pragmatist with a political agenda and ambitions of his own. Patrick Wilson's Travis is a failure as a father and husband, hoping to rebuild his life and reputation in Texas; Jason Patric's Bowie is a glowering, unsavory adventurer/businessman, involved in slave trafficking, and terminally ill during the siege (Hooker does, however, bow to legend, allowing the dying Bowie a chance to fire his pistols at the Mexicans before being overwhelmed). Emilio Echevarría, the first Mexican to ever play Santa Ana in an American film, has gotten bad press for his portrayal of the leader as a loud-mouthed, insensitive, lecherous egotist, but from all accounts, that WAS what the real Santa Ana was like.<br/><br/>While the slow pacing of most of the film is a problem, the film's final half hour appears rushed, as the Alamo's fall jumps quickly into Sam Houston's victory over Santa Ana, at San Jacinto (an event that occurred after a momentous six weeks of defeat and tragedy barely touched upon by Hancock). While it is understandable that the film makers wanted an 'upbeat' ending, it comes across as jarring, nonetheless.<br/><br/>If you like your heroes and history 'bigger than life', the 2004 ALAMO will disappoint, and you should stick to John Wayne's version. If, however, you want a new perspective, and are willing to dispense with the preconceptions of the past, this film has a LOT to offer!"
"big-o-1","10","59","73","11 April 2004"," The most historically authentic film yet on this subject!
","This film was the first one to portray the character of the Texas Revolution participants which viewers have long sought.  John Lee Hancock has build some credibility for himself over avoiding some overindulgence in using artistic license.<br/><br/>Limited use of special effects and reliance on good scripting and acting enhanced the film to its' optimum.  There was not much that could be done better.<br/><br/>The creation of the set near Wimberly Texas, forty miles north of San Antonio, permitted excellent views of Texas scenery that most settlers would have seen.<br/><br/>One unfortunate miscarriage of this film, was on the subject of Native American participation during this battle what went uncredited.  Sam Houston did have Native Americans under his command during the siege at San Jacinto. This Texas feels that more work needs to be done to credit Native Americans for their contribution.<br/><br/>Some untold truths left off the film are worthy of mention:<br/><br/>1.  Once Santa Anna was captured, his constitutional power to act as a head of state was lost, thus introducing a complication for the recognition of Texas as an sovereign nation.<br/><br/>2.  Sam Houston did have an additional reason to spare Santa Anna's life. Both were Masons and the code of conduct forbids taking the life of another Mason.  Masons still routinely hold high political offices today throughout the United States.<br/><br/>3.  The decision to acquire recognition of Texas as a nation required an acting head of state to preside, so the United States was chosen.  At this most opportune time when recognition was given, a deal was struck for a land purchase from Mexico, for territory west and north of Texas.<br/><br/>4.  Santa Anna was dictator four different times.<br/><br/>5.  Santa Anna was married several times and his last wife was 16 years old. After Santa Anna was deposed from his dictatorship for this final time, he went into recluse humiliated to live a modest life with his young wife, who paid people NOT to laugh and taunt him in the streets of their home village. Santa Anna died a pauper.<br/><br/>6.  The decision for Texas to be annexed into the United States has long been debated as pre-conceived, but it was clear that trade agreements and currency exchange was never going to be favorable to Texas as a nation with few alliances.  In order to improve it's standard of living, a choice was made to either accept annexation into the United States or be part of Mexico again.<br/><br/>The Alamo is one of several missions along the Olmos Creek/San Antonio river.  Most are still standing today and can be visited.<br/><br/>
The Daughters of the Texas Revolution were responsible for restoring the Alamo into it's current condition.  Developers nearly snuffed the existence of the entire Alamo before DTR intervened and secured funding for a purchase and restoral of about one-third of the original mission."

Waynes Alamo is indeed a timeless piece of movie history and will ALWAYS be my favourite film, but this new ALAMO is a completely different kettle of fish.This is thoughtful and realistic, the characters are believable and honest, and the battle scenes moving. You cannot compare the two films, one is a Hollywood masterpiece, the other a work of modern day honesty. Thornton as Davy Crockett i though was a throughly believable person, and totally different to Waynes version. I was greatly surprised by the lack of success of the film at the box office and the poor reviews, nevertheless i would count this amongest my favourites.

","Ever since I saw Fess Parker swinging ""Old Betsey"" on the Alamo walls, the story of the Alamo became a lifelong obsession. I have read every book I can find on the subject and have seen nearly every movie made concerning that epic 13-day siege. Hancock's ""The Alamo"" is, in my opinion, the most accurate depiction of the siege and fall of the Alamo. The movie is beautifully filmed with great attention to detail and historical accuracy. I was particularly impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of David (Davy) Crockett. From what I have read about Crockett's life, Thornton captured the true essence of the man and brought him to life. The final battle and fall of the Alamo is the highlight of the film. True to history, the attack begins in the pre-dawn darkness while the defenders are asleep in the mission. All other movies depict the final assault in broad daylight with the defenders ready and waiting. The scenes of the Mexican Army quietly approaching the walls are extremely well done and true to life. (Also somewhat scary!!) Granted there are some minor historical inaccuracies (as in all ""historical"" movies), but they do not detract from the overall story. I highly recommend this movie for any Alamo fanatic or anyone wishing to go beyond John Wayne's bloated rendition. A great film!!!"

As a history buff I would watch paint dry in a period costume ! Sadly the viewing public are not interested in seeing a pure history flick, no matter how interesting the subject matter. Therefore movie makers have to make stuff like Pearl Harbour, which is basically a 3 way love story with the beginning of the Second World War as a back drop ! But hey, look at Band of Brothers...a historical mini series that has proved itself very successful ! Finally, The Alamo is a fine movie, historically close to truth without getting overtly sentimental.

","Forget the comments from foreign sources, this is not what someone from Mexico, Europe, or anywhere else thinks.  This is about what a Texan thinks when he sees this version of the history that made Texas.  Texas is the only state in the United States that was once its own Republic, its own nation. Because of this, we have the only state flag that may be flown at the same heighth as the US flag, all others fly below it.  That is part of the reason we feel so strongly about our state, why our state is so revered from others, and why we are so hated.  It is what makes this state so unique and why I love it so.<br/><br/>This movie goes beyond what John Wayne's version told us and got to the truth about the characters involved.  It exposed Texan heroes for what they really were.  It also correctly personified Santa Anna for the highly nationalistic defender of Mexico and for the vicious dictator he was.  But ultimately, he was shown as the coward, who upon being defeated, tried to hide disguised as a Private and then relinquished the very soil he was fighting for simply so that his own life could be spared.  For anyone who considers that comment as a spoiler you are wrong, the history is written and the ending of this movie is clear known in that history.  I am reminded of a fool in line who made the comment as we were leaving an early showing, ""I hope none of these people gives the ending away"".<br/><br/>This was a very well made epic although I would not have hesitated to recommend it had it been longer to go into further depth.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, to fellow Texans for the telling of history we know, and to others who wonder why we from the Lone Star State have so much pride in a small band who died fighting an army that was thousands times larger."

","In the usual thoughts of The Alamo, you begin to think, Hardcore Action, Superheroes like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie. Boy, you were wrong. The main reason for this film's bad rap is because the trailer marketed it as a Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, this one proves to find itself in the more personal side of war. Despite constant bombardments by the Mexican army the film keeps a low-action tone until the last half hour or so. It, instead of focusing on the battle to defend the Alamo, John Lee Hancock depends on the ""soldiers"" defending it.<br/><br/>The film lays more on the shoulders of Sam Houston(Denis Quaid), Jim Bowie(Jason Patrick), William Barret Travis(Patrick Wilson) and Davy Crockett, The Lion of the West(Billy Bob Thorton). You would go in expecting Crockett to be the John Wayne infalable, super courageous, bear killing immortal but instead Billy Bob Thorton gives a human depiction of the legend. You can see the fear in his eyes and the determination in his soul with his suprise that the war ISN'T over when he arrives like he thought. He repeats to everyone, he can't jump the mississippi or fight bears. This, without a doubt is one of Thortons best performances. He dosen't take control and lead the Americans, this is left to Willam Travis, created flawlessly by Patrick Wilson.<br/><br/>An unexpectedly good Performance by the newcomer, he shows how Travis was inexperienced but still had the courage, inteligence and determination to fight who or whatever was thrown his way. When the time comes, he gives a speech to lead his men no matter how difficult the task is. He has a great quarrell with Jim Bowie for control, until finally the sick Bowie is forced to give Control to Travis because of his ailness. Bowie is played dead on by Patrick, he, even on his deathbed takes as many enemies to the grave with him before they steal the last minutes of his life. It was painful to watch Bowie do up the buttons of his waistcoat to join the battle, struggling to hold on to his own life. The men of the Alamo knew no help was coming especially from Houston who would not sentence his men to death trying to hold an old spanish mission.<br/><br/>The great Houston played by Denis Quaid in a simply ""scrumtralescant"" performance as the drunk war man trying to salvage what he could of his reputation by giving Texas it's freedom. Every carachter has their moment; Travis's speech, Bowie's attempt to do battle, Houston's ""remember the Alamo!"" and of course, one of the best scenes I have ever experienced in film when Crockett plays the violin along with the Mexican artillery march. This short moment is a scene of edenic quality inside the filthy deathbound fortress. Heaven visits the men as they live a minute or two of harmony in the dark hours of the seige, mexican and american alike.<br/><br/>By all this film proves it's excellence with it's spectacular battle scenes and outrageous sets deserving of an Oscar nomination, as well as Hancock's unique portrayal of lonely men in a war for their home. This film has found a high place in my favorites and is third(behind the passion and Eternal sunshine) as the best movie of the year so far. Hancock deserves awardment, as well as the rest of the Alamo. If I were to give this any other rating than A+, 10/10, two thumbs up, I would be a traitor to the world o film that I love so. I will always remember the Alamo."

","""The Alamo"" is the most accurate depiction of this historical event in years.  The Billy Bob Thornton performance is the zenith of the movie's strength.  His portrayal of David Crockett is worth the price of admission. It places the previous actors, Fess Parker and John Wayne, in a cartoon like, position in this dramatic role.  One must see this film on the big screen to appreciate it's panoramic impact.  Much of the action takes place in the Alamo itself, however, there is the extra benefit of the battle that took place at the San Jacinto Battle grounds.  I found it a refreshing presentation of this film genre.  All of the performances were deeply felt, and Billy Bob's is especially outstanding.  Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston also turns in a remarkable performance.  This was a long awaited movie, and well worth the wait.  Plan on a long film."

Dennis Quaid is exceptional as the unyielding and visionary Sam Houston, as is Jason Patric playing a smoldering James Bowie, whose restrained aggression is as commanding as the knife he's so famous for.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson is the perfect fit for a Colonel Travis that has too long needed rescuing from the almost prissy rendering proffered in John Wayne's celebrated production of The Alamo, which is also good - but this is the one for our generation. The self-effacing Davy Crockett played by Billy Bob Thornton is both endearing and charming in his genuineness. The whole production is both very likable and believable.<br/><br/>A beautiful and unexpected mystical quality runs through much of the film, from the formation of Texas and Houston's pursuit of his vision, to Bowie's dreamlike memories of his former life and later attempts to heal him, to the legend surrounding the life of Davy Crockett. It's an excellent movie with a beautiful score, and stands as one of the very few that is both one of my favorite war films as well as one of my favorites period.<br/><br/>California and New York are the center for both the liberal media and the liberal elite mindset as a whole. There is rivalry, jealousy, and strife between all men and their various institutions, at every level of all Society. It's no surprise to find it here. It has been this way since man fell from God's grace 6000 years ago in the Garden of Eden. Don't let anybody fool you, it is the anti conservative sentiment of this elite - against both the former President and the very successful southern state he hails from, that is behind this vitriolic and acidic denouncement of something not just good, but very good.

"Alfriend","Null","13","15","26 February 2006"," Historically accurate and so well done. A very underrated film.
","I have been a history buff most of my life and was a small child during the height of the Fess Parker, ""Davy Crockett"" series and film that played on ""The Wonderful World of Disney. Since then David Crockett was a particular favorite to research. This biopic effectively strips the myth from all of the people involved and reveals a far more compelling and honest story. Director John Lee Hancock and writers Leslie Bohem and Stephen Gaghan are the masterminds behind this effort and went out of their way to seek guidance from noted historians (check out DVD for their excellent commentary) and historical documents. No longer do we have men of marble but real flesh and blood, flawed people striving for greatness and success and ironically it is their very flaws (and the excellent acting) that make them both sympathetic and compelling to watch. This in turn makes their story far more moving.<br/><br/>The production values and special effects are amazing, authentic and go a long way to creating the look and feel of the period.<br/><br/>The Celtic style music by Carter Burwell is both stirring and beautiful and very well used throughout the film.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent all the way around. First and foremost IMHO are Jason Patric as Jim Bowie. Patric re-creates the legendary knife-fighter as a hardened cynical soldier of fortune with a burgeoning inner life. Patric is very believable as a man as quick to kill as he may have been to drink and carouse. <br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton was physically an unconventional, yet finally excellent choice for Davy Crockett. Following in the footsteps of physically large, macho actors like John Wayne, Fess Parker and Brian Keith, Thornton is not a big man at all and also shorter and less athletic looking than the real Crockett. But he compensates for this with a contained, very honest, entertaining and riveting portrayal of a man both blessed and cursed by his celebrity. It is also far truer to the historical Crockett. Thornton, Hancock and the writers do a great job in showing the often unknown, anti-war and philosophic side of Crockett's nature in revealing his feelings about his role in the Red Stick War and in the scene where he must watch a young Mexican soldier die. The campfire scene in the Alamo where Thornton/Crockett confesses his feelings about the Red-Stick War is actually based on Crockett's auto-biography. This is a thinking man with a conscience who has seen it all. This Crockett can not jump across a river or catch a cannonball or grin a bear to death (the latter a funny line from the Fess Parker version). He is a man who in the end like the rest of the men and women in the Alamo show the greatest bravery in fighting for what they believed in and in facing the greatest fear of all, the fear of death. In the finale, we see a close facsimile of how Crockett may have died. It is far more moving than the traditional last-man-standing scene that has played in the many versions prior to this one.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson is also excellent as William Travis. Here is a young man trying to live up to the ideals he has created for himself and struggling and bumbling along the way and finally coming to terms with the ultimate acceptance of having to be content ""with the man he is now"".<br/><br/>Jordi Mollà as the often overlooked Juan Seguin does a wonderful job in showing the great inner-conflict of a man who must fight against his own people to defeat the dictator Santa Ana. Seguin was later, like many Mexcians who sided with the ""Texian-Americans"" betrayed by the very people he fought with.<br/><br/>Emilio Echevarría is compelling as Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana. Although he is much too old for the character at that time, this is a leader both charismatic and consumed with greed. <br/><br/>Dennis Quaid walks a tough tight-rope in playing Sam Houston. This is another marble-like figure perhaps Texas's George Washington. Director Hancock and Quaid reveal a man tormented by what many feel today was a bipolar disorder that Houston suffered from. Quaid ably treads that fine line between overacting with enough of a dose of truth and realism to make this man come to life before us.<br/><br/>What makes people great in my mind is that they can accomplish things in spite of their foolishness, frailties or disabilities. This helps the rest of us to see that we too may have greatness in ourselves as well. What is compelling is that people can accomplish heroic deeds in spite of their fears or flaws.<br/><br/>Another great gesture is the honest portrayal of the black slaves, Sam and Joe. Thankfully we no longer have to see the faithful long-suffering slave throw himself across Jim Bowie to suffer the bayonet thrusts of the Mexican soldiers. Instead we see men who were suffering with the reality of slavery and not so willing to die for their ""master's"" cause.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast all add to the depth and credibility of the film. Each and every actor in the Alamo regardless of whether or not they had lines knew exactly who they were and you can feel that throughout the film.<br/><br/>When this movie first came out, I avoided seeing it, feeling that Thronton was not a great choice for Crockett and also feeling that perhaps this was going to be another flag-waving type film, making war seem like the great and noble deeds of men of marble. Instead we see the misfortune, confusion, degradation and personal isolation and yet great courage and fierce camaraderie that one can feel in combat. I'm glad for a chance to see historical characters with all their warts. It is far more compelling.<br/><br/>Do check out the DVD and the extras. It is an excellent history lesson and entertainment."

","I am a Texan. I love this movie not just because the performances were good or the movie was exciting, but because the movie was historically accurate. I found it refreshing that all the myth and legend was finally put to the side, unlike the John Wayne version,(Not that Mr. Wayne's version was bad.) and the true story of The Texas war for Independence was portrayed factually. Even the backgrounds featured in the movie are accurate, why, because it was filmed in the same general area that the actual ""runaway scrape"" took place. I love the fact that the characters flaws were portrayed without reserve. The gods of Texas history were not perfect no matter what any proud Texan will tell you. If you own the DVD you can choose to watch the commentary featuring two of the scholars behind the movie pointing out what few problems there are with the history and the movie. So if you love a good western, you're a history buff, just a good Texan, or a good Texan just at heart, this is a good movie for you."
"robfosters","8","23","29","8 July 2006"," A Fantastic Film
","It's great to see a historically accurate film like this. The bad reviews are not deserved. It's great, and Billy Bob puts in a superb performance as Crockett. The film tensely leads up to the main battle in a way you have to watch to appreciate. Davy Crockett harmonising on his violin with the Mexican army, causing them not to attack one particular night is fantastic. His comment of ""see what a little harmony can achieve"" is one of the best quotes i've seen. the film is extraordinary and too many people are writing this film off before they have a chance to watch it a second time and truly appreciate the magnificence and human element of the whole piece. Finally, I don't think there has been a more elaborate set ever designed. To fully recreate the Alamo is a great achievement. Don't listen to the reviews, just watch and..............<br/><br/>REMEMBER THE ALAMO!"

","Another version of the Alamo battle has been released and this is it. The Alamo recreations of the past in such films as The Alamo: Thirteen Days to Glory and John Wayne's version have both been very popular but just touch base on the facts.<br/><br/>The story is the one we learned in grade school. Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton has come to the Alamo so he can earn a piece of land once the war for Texas independence is won. He is now under the command of Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) and William Travis (Patrick Wilson) and is defending a small, unfinished mission near San Antonio. <br/><br/>Slowly Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) makes his away across Texas but is not permitted by the government to make an attack on Santa Anna's forces. Slowly the Alamo is surrounded and violent skirmishes occur around it. Eventually an all out night-charge is called on and the Alamo is overrun. <br/><br/>The same story but it is done a little more interesting this time with better acting. Instead of young Alec Baldwin as Travis we get small time actor Patrick Wilson and does a fine job. Billy Bob Thornton does a fine job after his disastrous Bad Santa (2003) and really brings out the character of Davy Crockett never really done before. <br/><br/>The battles are nicely done: not to much gore, believable deaths, and good visuals. Filmmaker John Lee Hancock brings out a fine Alamo film which is just short of being a great film. Now some accuracies brought out. Unlike most films showing the bed stricken Bowie standing up and firing off shots then swinging his knife, Bowie is finally made out to what actually happened, not being able to stand up and barely able to move. It is quite sad actually. No 1459 Mexicans are killed in this which makes it much better than the 1987 version where a bullet is fired and it kills ten guys. In actuality, historians believe that around two hundred Mexicans were killed, double that wounded.<br/><br/>The movie is very good. It has some good action and some fine acting. The plot is thin at a couple of points and Santa Anna is made out to be a Bond villain but it's fine. It is well worth a trip to the video store.<br/><br/>The Alamo. Starring: Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Quaid, Jason Patric, Patrick Wilson, and Emilio Echevarria. <br/><br/>3 out of 5 Stars"

","Just simply a wonderful story of how average people defeated a dictator. For years I've felt badly for the people of Mexico, and how their future of land and resources was lost. But the Battle for the Alamo presents the case for why Santa Ana had to be defeated. I'm sure you've seen the 1960 version of this story with John Wayne, but this film is worth viewing as well. Colorful in so many respects. It was worth watching."
"g-bodyl","8","6","6","3 May 2014"," Hugely Underrated Film!
","The Alamo is a vast, smartly-told historical epic that is way better than people give it credit for. It's a shame this film is widely known as one of the biggest box office failures in the history of cinema because this is a much better film than that. It describes a history lesson that is significant in our American history and one that features some very courageous heroes who sacrificed themselves for the good of our country.<br/><br/>John Lee Hancock's film tells the story of the fall of the Alamo. As Santa Anna's army is crusading in Texas and converging upon Fort Alamo, several hundred men including the famous Davey Crockett are preparing their defenses to fight Anna's army as they wait for reinforcements from General Sam Houston.<br/><br/>A cast like this shouldn't have been strong as it is and that impressed me the most. Dennis Quaid did a decent job as Sam Houston, but I feel like Billy Bob Thornton had one of his best roles of his career as Davey Crockett. He had many brilliant scenes and my favorite is when he was serenading both the Americans and the Mexicans with the fiddle.<br/><br/>Overall, the Alamo is a very good history lesson. If nothing else, this movie is set to inspire people about the history and the odds these heroes had to overcome. There are some pacing and editing issues here and it's unfortunate Hancock had to cut out lots of footage because sometimes the story seems to be uneven. But also, this features one of the best scores that Carter Burwell has done. All-in-all, this is a great film and much better than the general consensus. I rate this film 8/10."

The action and battle scenes were realistic. Credit was given to the Tejanos who fought there and who were important afterwards in the development of Texas. It was ""patriotic"" but not overly so. It had that intangible ""realness"" to it. I am sorry I did not see it in the theatre.

"andydufresne","10","12","14","11 April 2004"," VERY CLOSE to the truth.
","If you studied the history of Texas more than about 5 years ago you may not be able to swallow all of this movie.  Until that time the OFFICIAL VERSION said that all perished in the battle for the Alamo.  Recent revelations have led historians to believe that James Bowie was dying of lung cancer and fought his last fight from his death bed.  Davy Crockett was not killed in battle but was captured and later executed.  A couple of things that I think were not portrayed well or at all were that Bowie was a scoundral who had defrauded a lot of folks in Louisiana befroe fleeing for Texas.  Sam Houston had ordered The Alamo abandoned as he saw that it held no strategic or political value.  William Barrett Travis did indeed abandon a pregnant wife but it is (and was) widely believed that she was pregnant with another man's child.  There were many political and military divisions within the community of men fighting for Texas.  ""Volunteer"" groups were acting as their own armies and doing what they pleased at the moment.  Some believed that The Alamo was the gateway to Texas and that to capture it was to capture Texas.  Not all the political leaders approved of Houston as the General of all the armies.  Houston was too smart to think  that he could whip Santa Anna in a ""fair"" fight.  SAM HOUSTON ended up defeating the Mexican Army the way Washington defeated the British.  By getting a little lucky and picking the right time to fight.  THAT is why Houston absolutely could not ride to the rescue of those at the Alamo but could not come right out and say so.<br/><br/>IF you have a desire to get a real good take on Texas history of the time check out LONE STAR NATION by H.W. Brands.  An Excellent writer.  The book is available at any bookstore<br/><br/>As to the movie itself...I fought back tears when Travis addressed the men. Billy Bob was excellent.  If Davy Crockett was NOT as Thornton portrayed him he might well wish he was.<br/><br/>Quaid was very good as Houston.  NONE of the characters in this movie have enough time to develop their entire backstories and it is not always evidenet why he does the things he does.  He was a hard drinker and often drunk but pulls things together when necessary.<br/><br/>As to Santa Anna he was about like he is portrayed.  At Goliad he executed ALL those who surrendered.  At the battle of San Jacinto they were also yelling REMEMBER GOLIAD.  He was cruel.  He did things to his own people that were later repeated against Texas."
"mime.de","8","9","10","27 August 2005"," This film tells the truth
","As a child of ten years I have seen John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" for the first time. I was deeply impressed by the heroic story, and till this day as a man in the fifties, I still love this movie. Okay, I know now much more today about the real story when Texas fought for independence. For sure, the Duke's interpretation of Davy Crockett is sometimes more Cardinal Spellman as one of the king of the wild frontier. And sometimes the pathos of some scenes is intolerable. But the battle scenes are great, Richard Widmark did a fine job as Jim Bowie and the music composed by my favorite composer Dimitri Tiomkin is surpassing. In contrast to Wayne's epic John Lee Hancocks dark and melancholy picture don't want to narrate a fairy-tale for American patriots. This films tells the truth about the ""13 days of glory"", the historical background and the the motives and characters of the volunteers who fought in Alamo and at San Jacinto. I'm not a historian, but what I ever have read about Santa Anna, Sam Houston and all the circumstances down in Texas, from all films this one is very close to the authentic story. We see not heroes at all - what we see is an interesting, exciting, good casted, sensational photographed and well directed film about the things happened when the Lone Star State was born. I cannot understand the comments saying ""The Alamo"" is too long or boring or there are too much dialogs and too little action in it. Look for the admirable performance of Dennis Quaid and the outstanding Davy-Crockett-characterization of Billy Bob Thornton. ""The Alamo"" 1960) is a picture of the childhood, ""The Alamo"" (2004) one for the adulthood. Great movie, I give 8 out of 10 stars."

","Although I am a true John Wayne fan  and I saw his movie over 22 times on the screen, I did enjoy the Alamo 2004.  I am not sure I agree with the capturing of Davey Crockett I did feel the movie captured the spirit of the defenders.  I was raised in Oklahoma but I always felt a deep love and respect for the Alamo.  The movie was entertaining and made you proud of the people involved.  I haven't decided yet whether I liked it as much as the 1960 version but I have now seen it 5 times and like it better each time I see it.  One of the scenes I enjoyed the most was the one where Davey Crockett was fiddleing on the wall of the Alamo while the Mexican army played the cutthroat music.  The feelings the defenders must have felt while they listened to the Mexican music must have been heart wrenching."

","After all the negative press, I went to this film with very low expectations -- but I came away a fan. The panoramic sweep of this film is powerful and subtle, and its ensemble cast is as smooth as the whiskey Sam Houston downs in a single gulp in an early scene. <br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton steals the show as Crockett, adding both comic moments and a richly somber humility. The period details are very accurate, and the dialogue, unlike that in many period films, actually emulates the locution and rhythm of the nineteenth century quite aptly. It may not be the greatest epic war movie I've seen lately -- but it's good enough to hold its own, and I'm certain I'll want to see it again."

","The movie was very realistic and somewhat true to form. Hollywood is a terrible historian, but this time they were pretty close. John Wayne's Alamo always insulted me because the only thing factual in his Alamo movie were the names of the stars and the mission. Other than that, everything was completely false, including the reason for the battle in the first place. This Alamo movie obviously took some liberties but was fairly factual. Disney's Crocket using Fess Parker and John Wayne's Alamo movie started a movement to discount any historical documents that didn't show the American propaganda these films threw out. This Alamo movie showed the reality of the people and the times.<br/><br/>If you are a Texan, this is a must see.

"Eradan","9","5","5","18 June 2019"," Far Better Than It Was Given Credit For
","""The Alamo"" (2004) is not perfect but it's far better than it was given credit for. It is also aesthetically and historically superior to the 1960, John Wayne version of the legend so beloved by hardcore conservatives. In particular, the sequence when the Mexican Army storms the Alamo is the most historically accurate depiction of this confrontation ever put on film.<br/><br/>The film's great flaw is the 12-minute Battle of San Jacinto sequence tacked on at the end. It's just too much and it breaks up the dramatic flow of the movie. It's as if ""Braveheart"", instead of ending with the martyrdom of William Wallace, had fifteen minutes added on telling the story of Robert Bruce's victory at Bannockburn. The makers of ""Braveheart"" correctly gave the real-life sequel to Wallace's death about a minute's worth of narration at the very end. John Lee Hancock should have taken the hint.<br/><br/>A minor flaw was the scene where Travis addresses his troops when it becomes obvious that they're not going to be rescued or reinforced before Santa Anna's assault. His self-deprecating and deeply personal speech does not ring true for the character or the period. Nobody talked that way back then, least of all a wannabe hero like William Barrett Travis.<br/><br/>Nitpicking aside, the real problem ""The Alamo"" (2004) had was that it collided headfirst with the masses' addiction to mythology. Hardcore conservatives rejected it because it humanized the legendary heroes of the Alamo (especially Davy Crockett) while leftists rejected it because it didn't demonize this set of dead white males. And in between these warring political tribes, the great mass of sheeple rejected the movie because it didn't give them enough bang for their buck. If those idiots were going to put down $12 for a flick, they expected to get a lot more sex, violence, special effects and celebrity than ""The Alamo"" had to offer.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton should have received an Academy Award nomination for his brilliant portrayal of Davy Crockett. Thornton's Crockett is a political and pop culture superstar who feels paralyzed by his own legend and suffocated by his fans to the point he barely knows who he is anymore.<br/><br/>Emilio Echevarría was miscast as Santa Anna (a much younger man in 1836 than Echevarria) but the lines written for his character are quite good and he delivers them with verve. His Santa Anna is an egomaniac whose fascistic and tyrannical tendencies are (partly) compensated for by his genuine love for his country.<br/><br/>The other main characters were basically good but there wasn't enough time to develop them deeply. I've seen most of the movies and miniseries about the Texan Revolution and they all do this, ie choose one or two of the main charactors from the Alamo Mythos and show events from their perspective.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate ""The Alamo"" a nine on the IMDb scale. Anybody who's interested in Texas, or American folklore, or this period of history will find it well worth their time."
"rrstewart-53923","7","5","5","21 December 2018"," Reviewers did gross injustice to this film
","When this film came out in 2004, almost every review in the media (with the notable exception of Ebert) was roundly negative. When I first saw it about a year later, I held my breath, expecting to hold my nose, but was utterly surprised by how different my own take was from that of the pundits. Between the incredibly detailed and historically accurate sets, costumes and other production details, to the extensive character development, exposition of historical context and superb acting, I was left wondering if I had seen the same film as the one the legion of professional opinion makers saw, who torpedoed it. In watching it again, my opinion has only grown over time, and as one who has read more extensively on the subject, I can only conclude that the meanness with which it was treated had all the makings of a deliberate, coordinated effort, as most of these negative reviews dwelt on relatively minor imperfections while making no mention whatsoever of the superb attention to historical detail, the wonderful acting, and not least, the fact that for the first time Santa Anna and numerous others in his officer corp were given names and acted like 3-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>Apparently much of the contemporary dismay of many upon viewing it is that it was not like John Wayne's 1960 effort of the same title (which also bombed at the box office), which gave a totally one-sided view of history, replete with two-dimensional characters uttering jingoistic pieties like ""freedom"" and ""republic"" without mentioning that the ""freedom"" was all about the freedom to have slaves!<br/><br/>Sure, the film could have been better. Apparently original director Ron Howard had asked for a budget of nearly double the one finally secured, which would undoubtedly have allowed for more visual effects, with more detailed battle scenes, but no movie is perfect and considering what they film makers did achieve, I think it is only right that The Alamo (2004) be given a second look."
"scott88-4","7","5","5","8 June 2006"," Not What I Waited ""Forever"" For, But A Good Re-Telling..
","Being a self-confessed HUGE Alamo fan (not many of those up here in Canada I imagine), I knew that this film was coming for years, and waited anxiously. Upon arrival however, I heard the stories that made me begin to think, ""Oh no..."". First, the involvement of Disney. God...does everything they touch turn to bile? That worried me. Then, the self-dismissal of Ron Howard as director. I had understood that Howard wanted to take the film in a bit of a different direction, make it ""edgy"" and show the violence of the siege in all its ""glory"". In fact, it was a bloody final battle and not at all as pretty as previously shown by countless other films. But, of course, Disney slashed the budget and were probably horrified that there was going to be blood and cruel violence in their war epic. How appalling I'm sure!!!! Howard left soon afterward.<br/><br/>Whle I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and embraced Billy Bob as Crockett, I couldn't give this long awaited friend a ""10"". While Jason Patric was admirable as Bowie, I though Dennis Quaid a poor cast as Houston. The sets were breathtaking and period perfect. Costuming and weaponry wonderful and score was above average. Some scenes in particular I thought really well done were the Crockett ""fiddle duet"" with the Mexicans, Crockett plinking on the fiddle while the Mexican army crept through the darkness to surprise the sleeping garrison, Travis' speech to the doomed troops, and the final minutes of the assault as Crockett looks to the young boy and realizes some sort of destiny.<br/><br/>I really think the final assault scene could have been longer. After all, telling a story is crucial, but the last assault might have been a bit longer in my opinion. AND it was, much to Disney's delight I'm sure, totally bloodless. Now I know there are a lot of opinions here already that probably applaud the lack of blood and brutality (why would we have that in battle scenes anyway????), but come on! There was much more blood and carnage in John Wayne's version as well as in classics such as ""Zulu"" and the beautifully bloody ""The Wild Bunch"". We get to see a glimpse of the head shot Travis as well as a bloodied Bowie, but they are quite tame. The battle scenes were wonderfully staged and the night/pore-dawn assault a treat for the eyes (as it truly happened BTW), but I thought it too antiseptic. The final battle for the Alamo was extremely brutal, sadistic, and cruel in fact. Hand to hand fighting was ferocious, yet the film really showed none of it. I would have liked them to show this side of the battle instead of trying to give us a little ""Fess Parker"". But then again, when Disney's involved, you know there is going to be some problems. I'm not asking for a horror show here...just a little more realism and some uncomfortable moments. Remember, the real event was as nasty as they come and the defenders slaughtered in a gruesome manner. Jeeez, even John Wayne got a little blood on him!! Way to go again Disney. I wish Hancock would have pushed a bit more for some darker moments.<br/><br/>Overall though, a good entry and easily the best of all the Alamo films. Billy Bob was a magnificent choice as DC and made it much more enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>Since this film bombed so badly at the box office, I don't see any more Alamo films being made in my lifetime....too bad. Let's hope Disney doesn't look to get involved in a ""Custer's Last Stand"" and/or a ""Rourke's Drift"" type of film. The farther they stay out of the WAR film biz, the better."
"ven2s","8","8","9","24 April 2004"," Very Moving
","This is a very character driven movie especially as it looks at the involvement of Jim Bowie, David Crockett, William Travis, and Antonio de Santa Ana.  The first three were men basically running from their pasts, whether from legend or infamy, while the last believed he was the Napoleon of the west.  In the end, those who were not seeking fame nor saw themselves as heroes but deeply flawed human beings, became true heroes and eternal; while the last, although remembered, became less than what he thought he was. In reality, the Alamo was Mexico's response to an insidious invasion by the United States across it borders through americans who either became mexican citizens ( in order to be elligible for lands)or were descendents of such and became known as Tejanos. In other words, Mexicans fought Mexicans at the Alamo. The other basic cause of this fight, was slavery. Many of the heroes of the Alamo and those in the lands of Texas held slaves and the Mexican Government had outlawed slavery. Many of the slave holders rebelled against this imposition by the Mexican government and this ultimately culminated in a civil war and the ultimate acquisition of Texas, initially to be a country unto itself apart from the United States, but was soon assimilated into the other states but is still a Lone Star.<br/><br/>Although this is hinted at in the movie, a viewing of the history channel's presentation on the Alamo and Davie Crockett, will give one a deeper understanding of what the context was for this tragic yet heroic conflict. Why heroic? Because the people at the Alamo faced a hopeless situation with dignity and determination. Regardless of their views,  they shed their blood for what they believed and for freedom. Right or wrong, their blood won Texas. In these days in which we are involved in a lengthy war whose outcome is trully unknown, will Americans show the fortitude to see it through or will we cut and run?  Remember the Alamo where ordinary people did an extraordinary thing!"

"rbsjrx","7","10","12","31 December 2006"," A tricky subject done well
","Making a film about the Alamo in 2004 was a risky business. On the one hand, you have the traditional story which doesn't always stand up to close historical scrutiny. One the other, you have revisionist history which often tosses out the inconvenient, replacing it with material which is just as suspect, but politically correct.<br/><br/>This film takes the middle road which, like all compromises, is guaranteed to leave both sides unsatisfied. I believe this simple fact underlies many of the poor reviews this film received.<br/><br/>It is to the film's credit that it presents the most historically credible version of the events leading up to the birth of the Republic of Texas. To be sure, there are still points which may be quibbled over. But without the benefit of a time machine, it's difficult to come up with a more reliable exposition of the known facts.<br/><br/>And that is, to many critics, another of the film's weaknesses. The average movie goer wants to be entertained and reacts negatively to any obvious attempt to educate him/her in the process. That's a sad commentary on our society, but that's the way it is. This movie could have been more entertaining, but then it wouldn't have been as educational. I appreciate accuracy and educational value in historical films, so I really liked it.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this... If you're looking for a familiar retelling of the Alamo story which sticks to the established mythology, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a complete retelling which turns the entire story on its ear, this isn't for you. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a real story of real people who changed the face of America, this is a really good film."
"levistie","10","10","12","2 January 2006"," Perfection
","Other than some editing errors and few cheesy lines, this film is one of the best dramatic/war films I've seen. Director John Lee Hancock did a magnificent job of making a historically accurate film without making it boring. It tells the story of the 13 day siege and fall of the Alamo that helped lead to Texas Independence. But it's not the battles or the killings that make this such a great war film, it's the character study. Because deep down that's what this film is, a study of the men who fought for Texas independence. We see deep into their thoughts and feelings as with each day they come to the realization that they could die at any moment. By the end of the film you don't want to see anyone die, from the big name actors, to the extra being butchered in the background. Never has there been such a portrayal of this great battle, nor has there been such a gut wrenching scene as when Billy Bob Thornton (plays David Crockett) stands atop the walls of the Alamo and plays along with the Mexican marching band bringing a moment of peace as both sides realize that they are all just ordinary men caught in a horrible situation. This is the best film ever made, hands down. 10 out of 10."
"Napoleon799","10","10","12","4 September 2004"," I Loved It
","I loved this movie more than any other history movie so far. Since the fourth grade I've always been interested in the Alamo and the Texan Revolution. When I heard about a brand new film based upon the battle of the Alamo I counted down the days for the first day it came out... and I made it. Oh yeah sure maybe it had some sad and unfair parts but I knew what was going to happen and who was going to die. Now, I saw ""The Rookie"" and I saw ""The Missing"" and due to my opinion John Lee Hancock was the perfect director for this film. I lost all my respect to Ron Howard since that crappy film (Though I loved a Beautiful Mind and The Grinch). Thank goodness that he didn't direct that film, for what I heard in the trivia Russell Crowe was going to play Crockett! Hell No! Leave that part to a true American acting stylist and stay with Master and Commander (no offense).<br/><br/>Oscar winner Billy Bob Thornton was perfect to be Sam Houston. Dennis Quaid went perfect as well with Sam Houston. Though so would've Oscar-nominee Tom Berenger, no? Emilo Echevarria did seem old in that film. He looked twenty years older than the actual thirty year old Santa Anna but he still performed great. William Travis was around I think twenty three during his last days; Patrick Wilson is though thirty-one years old. But, leaving out the age he did better than Oscar-nominees Alec Baldwin and Laurence Harvey. Now as for Jim Bowie... I think Oscar-nominee Richard Widmark and James Arness did better than Jason Patric however. <br/><br/>Sound was better than The Two Towers, screenplay was great, music was alright, cinematography was good, costumes were normal, the film was at perfect movement speed, and the performances were beautiful. 10 out of 10. No. I'll be honest at least; 9.5 out of 10. That's fair. I hope that film becomes Oscar-nominated for at least Best Actor and Supporting Actor, Best Direct, Best Sound, Best Music, probably Best Screen writing, but mostly it should be nominated for Best Picture.<br/><br/>!THE ALAMO WAS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR!"
"CrockettKid","10","11","14","3 May 2004"," If it was just me, simple old Crockett, I might just say this is the best movie ever...

Billy bob might juat be the best crockett ever and their never will be a better one. The depiction of the battle of the Alamo was amazing. Every single shot was amazing. Carefully done to show the full persepctive of the battle. I mean, when those axe cutting mexicans attack the west wall, i was scared out of my wits. And crockett getting executed.. Amazing! so i think i would definetly say best movie ever and deserves a ten out of ten. And by the way, if u dont think that let me warn u... I'm a Screamer!"
"garrycane-1","10","9","11","4 August 2005"," How I thought it would be
","I was at the Alamo a year or so ago and I found it a fairly disjointed experience. I did however build a picture in my minds eye of how it must have been and when I finally got to watch the latest interpretation of events I was pleasantly surprised. Moving beyond cinematography, direction, production, lighting and effects all of which were 1st class I must give a big thumbs down to casting... but only on one count.... what were they thinking of by casting Jason Patric as Jim Bowie? I firmly believe he was miss-cast. Whilst Thornton gave an epic and realistic view of Crockett Patric left us in a damp heap, sweating and thirsty. Overall I would say the direction and production was about as good as it gets but sadly this was not reflected in the Academy awards ( We all know this is no benchmark). An enjoyable movie overall and if you are ever down San Antonio way look in as I swear you can feel the spirit of those brave men beside you."
"Homesleece","9","9","11","31 December 2004"," Remember the Alamo
","I spent six weeks in Texas History class learning about the Battle of the Alamo. The causes, the actual battle, and the aftermath. Then we had to write an essay comparing Lon Tinkle's 13 Days to Glory to at least four other books.<br/><br/>Then it's near the end of the first semester, so our teacher lets us watch the movie during the class. I was stunned at how great the actors were, and the final day of the siege was absolutely stunning. The language, clothing, and appearance of the characters were on the spot. Don't be fooled by reports that this film is not historically accurate, because it pretty much shows what happened during the days there.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some acts of bravado that probably didn't happen, but they fit in nicely. This movie has an amazing ability to show that the defenders had some faults, yet it also portrays the raw courage in the atmosphere."
"B24","7","9","11","17 April 2004"," A few words to describe many
","Apart from colorful and dramatic sequences that play lavishly over the screen, imparting a generally correct and truthful sense of place as well as history, this is a movie of words.  Too many in some places and too few in others.<br/><br/>This is not the cartoonish Alamo of Fess Parker or John Wayne.  Thankfully so.  But neither is it a summary of all that was actually good or bad about the seminal event that created ""Texas"" as a concept bigger than life and arguably still representative of the changing frontier in North America.<br/><br/>To put it briefly, I liked what was here but came away dismayed by what was not here.  Any movie that presumes to portray an actual and well-documented historical event must do more than touch on this or that fragment of fact. The production staff is obliged to accept what is presented to them by the writers, the actors, and the director -- leaving on the cutting room floor only irrelevant scraps.  I have the feeling that procedure was not followed here.  Too many threads holding the story together are missing.<br/><br/>For example, the single most important motive lying at the heart of the Texas rebellion is inadequately explained.  Was it merely greed and personal ambition on both sides that created the conflict?  Or racial and ethnic disputes?  Or Manifest Destiny?  There is absolutely no clear picture to be gained from this movie that sets in perspective what the fuss was all about. Yet we have glorious and stirring speeches (or at least aphorisms) emanating from all parties, delineating character rather well but existing only in an isolated truth here or a compelling argument there.<br/><br/>Somewhere on that cutting room floor, I suspect, are scenes that focus less on individual character and more on the fact that ""Texians"" were a unique combination of English-speaking and Spanish-speaking citizens of the newly-created nation of Mexico, a remote outpost or colony of the central government that grew too large for that government to handle.  In that sense, it was just like any other historical event reflecting a desire on the part of a distinct group of persons living at the edge of an empire to achieve self-government.<br/><br/>When seen thus, the merging of cultural differences that characterize Texas even today presents a unified entity of mutual interest.  What holds this story together, as very ably shown in bits and pieces of the film, is how important it is to recognize what humanity holds in common in spite of apparent differences.<br/><br/>Little wonder that Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett steals the show. (Unlike Dennis Quaid as a one-dimensional caricature of my collateral ancestor Sam Houston.)  This movie could have been another thirty minutes longer and mutually subtitled to get at the heart of its message.  No Oscars for the current cut."
"goonie2979","10","9","11","11 April 2004"," Great Movie
","Most of the criticism I've seen for this movie seems to be a little misplaced.  First of all, this movie is no more anti-Mexican than ""Saving Private Ryan"" is anti-German.  Hancock does a good job to portray the Mexican soldiers as just that, soldiers. Most of the animosity is directed towards Santa Anna who is by no means considered a hero in Mexican historical culture but instead a tyrant.  Being a person who has spent an extensive amount of time studying Texas history, the Alamo in particular, I did notice there were some inaccuracies but thats to be expected.  This is Hollywood not history.  I am not about to sit here and act high and mighty and rip apart this movie because it's not 100% on what actually happened. The truth is no one can actually say they know because it's been a highly debated topic for some years now.  What I can say is that I feel this is a very good movie which helps to give one a sense of sacrifice and integrity and bring a human feel to a legendary event."
"randysigley","10","9","11","11 April 2004"," A battle epic based on action and not gore
","War movies and battle epics can shock and dismay with gore and special effects or they can tell the story of the struggle through good camera use, powerful suggestion, and the use of intense action to draw in the audience. The Alamo did the latter and I am pleased that it provided a good movie without relying on the annoying camera jiggle and gory effects of Private Ryan.  The point of this movie is the struggle, and even though it is set in a battle setting, the higher message can be conveyed without shock tactics.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton finally made David Crockett a real person without debunking the myth or the man.  Crockett and others were there by happenstance, and were faced with a choice of dishonor or death.  He is effective."
"adrianarm","9","8","10","11 April 2004"," Remember The Alamo At Oscar Time
","After all the rumors that this film was in trouble, writer/directer John Lee Hancock delivers a superlative epic film with outstanding performances that should be remembered at Oscar time.<br/><br/>Balancing historical facts with Hollywood entertainment is no easy task, but Hancock does it here with ease. Visually the film is breathtaking and done with a minimum of special effects.<br/><br/>Working from a script that is reminiscence of Horton Foote, the film excels with three-dimensional charaters that are flawed human beings that show courage of mythical proportions. The performances are right on the mark, from Billy Bob Thornton's Crockett, Dennis Quaid's Houston, Patrick Wilson's Travis, to Emilio Echevarria's Santa Anna. The only one-note character seems to Jason Patric's Bowie. Julia Roberts' ex-boyfriend is not one of the great actors of our time, but in all fairness, this character seems to be written with little for him to do. It's the one major disappointment of the film. But the real stand-out here is Billy Bob Thornton, who gives one of his best performances to date.<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of people that were disappointed by this film. If you are expecting a John Wayne movie, rent ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" and stay at home. If you are such a history buff that if Travis doesn't draw a line in the dirt will bother you, then watch Ken Burns ""Civil War"" for the 1000th time. And if you are expecting a huge war film full of gore and guts, just rent ""Saving Private Ryan"" and save some money.<br/><br/>But if you want to see an intelligently conceived and excluded film with outstanding performances of this or any year, this maybe the film for you. All that I can tell you is, that I saw ""The Alamo"" at a packed bargain matinee, and at the film's end, the audience gave it a standing ovation. I can't remember a movie that received that response in a long, long time."
"primroseballinger","10","6","7","6 February 2008"," One of my favorite movies of all time
","This movie is historically valid in many respects, much more so than other Alamo films. Old San Antonio was reconstructed near present day San Antonio, so the setting was about as close to the real place as you could get.The parts were very well cast, and the acting was wonderful. I'm with the other reviewer: I don't understand why this movie didn't do better at the box office. The one reason I can think of is that it focused on politics and war tactics rather than romance. Even though romance did not figure prominently in the film, for the empathetic person with some imagination, there was romance there too: James Bowie, still grieving for his deceased wife; his sister-in-law who perhaps had always secretly been in love with him; and Susanah Dickinson, a survivor of the Battle of the Alamo who watched her husband die there. Another thing I liked about the movie was that it did not end at the Alamo but followed the Texas War of Independence to its end at the Battle of San Jacinto, where General Sam Houston used hi knowledge of the strategies used by Wellington against Napoleon to defeat General Santa Ana, known as the Napoleon of the West."
"Rod_Heath","8","6","7","11 October 2005"," Stands Tall
","(Historical spoilers ahead) The Alamo story stands as proud and singular in U.S. history as the fort itself, yet in cinema has consistently proved a magnet for pomposity and bellicosity, as in John Wayne's loud, cardboard epic that was torn between historical speechifying and horse opera shenanigans, or the under-produced, stodgy Republic production ""The Last Command"". John Lee Hancock's version of the story is the most historically accurate to date, but historical accuracy is far from being the only value in film-making. We also ask - is it dramatic? Exciting? Do the characters and their plight move us? Can it make us forget the simplistic drum-pound of the usual way the story is told? For the first ten minutes or so of Hancock's ""The Alamo"", I was unsure - a proliferation of bad wigs, scrappy character introductions, and clunker lines of dialog made me afraid I was in for an exercise along the order of ""Revolution"". However, Hancock slowly gained a reign on the disparate story elements, and produces a resolutely low-key film, bordering on anti-heroic. It pricks the myth of every figure involved, but it's not the loud icon-breaking satire of, say, ""Little Big Man""; instead, by locating and exposing the weaknesses of its titan heroes, they become much more vital and interesting people.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton's Davy Crockett is a wily, intelligent, haunted man who would much rather play fiddle at a dance than risk his life and those of others, yet his life has already been misshapen by his own legend. He maintains a jovial smile even as he realizes he's stumbled into a situation that will certainly mean death and horror. When he engages in up-close killing the expression on his face indicates that his stomach has sunk into his boots in sorrow. Yet, when demanded, he gives stalwart service, and his final scene is suitably heroic yet entirely in character as he meets his death with cool defiance. Jason Patric's Jim Bowie is a tough but rootless, morally and mortally sick man, hanging grimly onto the ghostly memory of brief happiness with his Tejana wife, the only escape he ever found from the pain, both physical and spiritual, from his shady of past. Patrick Wilson's William Travis is no rabble-rousing martinet but a scared, irresponsible, devolved semi-aristocrat trying desperately to prove himself up to the position of command he has been given. These are the chief figures in a minutely described, slowly building nightmare. The idea of these men's growth, touched on in ""The Last Command"", is here the whole story.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid does good work - although he occasionally strains at being so intense and serious, when he does best bringing a wry, boyish humor to his parts - as Sam Houston, like the Alamo defenders a damaged man, the bloom having gone off his statesman's figure, reduced to a near-drunkard squabbling with tinny would-be politicians, trying to find the resolve and manpower to take on a professional army, which he painfully receives in the butchery of his friends. The trouble is, Houston disappears from the story for so long we almost forget about him, and this contributes to the film's finale, the battle of San Jocinto, being less effective than the body of the film, which so effectively involves us with the Alamo defenders, and also the action is scrappy and throwaway compared to that grand battle scene. Nonetheless, I liked that Hancock included this, as it makes it clear what the Alamo meant to the run of history, instead of appearing a context-lacking bit of bravado.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why this failed to light up either the box office or the awards season. It's completely against the grain of ""Braveheart"" and ""Gladiator""-style historical romancing. Despite having been bankrolled by Disney as a work designed to inspire patriotism, it completely refuses to turn into ""Pearl Harbor"" idiocy. Instead, Hancock presents a tense, dark, rousing yet tragic war film, chasing solid realism and a breath of poetry, as in the scenes where Bowie, slowly expiring from consumption, lies in a candle-lit room, tended by his tough and loyal sister-in-law, whose face is a map of character and beauty; these scenes, pitched on an ethereal ground between life and death, appropriate considering these men are dying in a church, counterpoints the grim, no-nonsense necessity of the defense. Then there's the terrific moment when Crockett gives harmony to the Mexican war drums with his fiddle, the film's best expression of a sense of heroism that is resolutely human yet transcendent.<br/><br/>If stories that the film was severely edited are true, I expect there was some more material on Jordi Molla's fine but limited turn as Juan Seguin, one of the chief Tejana rebels, although he does get great moments towards the end, and also on the painfully contradictory position of the slaves in the Alamo, who must decide whether their first loyalty is to the people they know - their owners - or the people they don't, who might just free them. But at least this aspect is considered. This story is not the triumph of righteous Monroe Doctrinism but the history of an uncertain, contradictory idealism that might lead anywhere. Emilio Echevarria's Santa Anna - placing aside all arguments over his historical status - strikes me as a bit too old and seamy to capture a man who really did impress his soldiers and country with his dashing persona, and he never quite escapes the realm of an easy-to-hiss movie villain; it would make his final revelation as a gutless tyrant more effective if he seemed previously a bit less of a toad.<br/><br/>If ""The Alamo"" ultimately lacks the fire and consistency that make for a great film, nonetheless, like another film with a western setting, a large budget, an artistic eye, and status as a complete box office dud that I love - ""Heaven's Gate"" - I hope this film might stand tall in ten or twenty years time."
"g-furr","9","6","7","24 April 2004"," Maybe I'm Getting Old, But I Enjoyed This
","I cannot understand why this movie is being panned and rated down. The acting is so well done without being overdone (as is the case in so many movies these days). Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett was phenomenal. He portrayed Crockett just as I imagined the man probably was, a somewhat unwilling legend who is not really where he wants to be but who nonetheless does what he can to help a bad situation. His story about a battle with Creek Indians that he participated in as a youth is riveting.<br/><br/>
Santa Ana is a true despot, in love with himself and his glory, even considering his own soldiers chickens to be slaughtered. The Texians were portrayed as very human: selfish, greedy, violent, but capable of great heroism and sacrifice. The Mexicans were appropriately shown as brave capable soldiers, on both sides of the battle. I feared there might be political revisionism at work, but overall I think the attitudes and words of the participants were probably pretty accurate reflections of the times. I never had any illusions that the Texians were saints.<br/><br/>
As promised, the set is outstanding. The battle scenes are very realistic. Gunfire is heard less sporadically than you would expect in a modern battle because it took so long to load for one shot. It takes a while for the plot to get to the battle, but the tension builds quite well. The pacing was very effective as the doomed men in the Alamo slowly came to realize there would be no escape. The director did a good job of drawing me into understanding that feeling of hopelessness.<br/><br/>I guess people don't go to see movies unless they contain exploding helicopters, massive CG created armies in battle and funny characters who do things that are not believable. It's too bad people can't watch two hours of well acted staging of a historical event that includes some good dialogue. I guess today's movie goers have an attention span for conversation of about 30 seconds.<br/><br/>The one negative was the ending which crammed the month long retreat of Sam Houston and his eventual victory at San Jacinto into about 20 minutes. It was somewhat anti-climactic after what happened at the Alamo. I know that needed to be shown because it is also part of the story, but it just seemed a little out of synch after the breath taking drama in San Antonio.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all."

","John Wayne, move your ass over.  This version has more of the realism that Wayne's classic missed. Although Billy Bob Thornton will never surpass John Wayne as an actor,  John Lee Hancock has definitely surpassed him, given us a superior movie in the role of director. The battle scenes were well done. I must admit though, I did miss what is a traditional memory to Texans, that of Travis drawing a line in the sand, and that of Bowie asking his men to carry him across Travis' line.  As iconoclastic as I am, that omission hurt. Although there were a couple of scenes that were at best apocryphal, (the fiddling during the Mexican Army's playing of ""Deguello"" comes to mind), it was a very satisfying movie."

It wasn't like a dead end plot. This quality is very good in a movie. This movie reminded me alot of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid. Which if you saw that movie you'd know that it too was action and drama. I think that directors should make more movies based on historical events, as long as the facts remain the same. This movie will bring tears to your eyes as you sit in the seat, it's like you're traveling back in time. And you're right up close with the men who fought for their families and lives.

","I am glad this movie included the victorious BATTLE OF SAN JACINTO which occurred about 6 weeks after the siege of the Alamo. Amazing to see that 800 Texans defeated 1600 Mexicans in 18 MINUTES.<br/><br/>The battle at the Alamo was the prelude to that victory at San Jacinto over Santa Anna where his life was traded for Texas independence.<br/><br/>Other movies left this out and it's important in explaining how Texas split from Mexico to become the 28th state of the United States.<br/><br/>What this film did not clearly develop were the historical circumstances that led to the Alamo battle. Mexico had encouraged white settlements in the area and then decided otherwise. White Texians and Mexican Tejanos lived in relative peace together in the San Antonio area. They even fought together at the Alamo and at San Jacinto.<br/><br/>Included on the DVD is a deleted scene from the 2004 movie which showed Mexican General Cos and his defeated Mexican troops marching out of San Antonio after a battle that happened PRIOR to the Alamo. Cos had agreed to leave the settlements alone but Santa Anna broke that pledge. Those scenes should NOT have been deleted.<br/><br/>The beginning of Alamo 2004 is too murky. What this movie needed was a better set up and a voice-over narrative to more clearly explain what was going on. <br/><br/>HOW THE WEST WAS WON employed this technique and it used Spencer Tracy as the narrator.

I was impressed by the amount of detail put into this movie. The way the film maker focused on the important characters made the story move along, while still leaving the viewers in the loop.

","I am not a film critic but a historian with an interest in good films.  As an Texas historian, the film struck me as accurate to the extent that an historical film can be.  We do not know what was said when and by whom during the day to day lives of long dead men.  We do know what others have said they said.  We have transcriptions of speeches and we have diaries. Some historical evidence is conclusive, some is debateable.  I do find that the conclusive parts of the fight for the Alamo is very accurate.  I do find that individual conversations, eventhough fictional, are likely in their characterisations of the person.  I especially find the character of Santa Anna well documented.  Although we know less about Mr. Crockett than some of the other participants, I for one hope that this written character as superlatively played by Mr. Thornton is a viable interpretation of the man. One has the feeling of ""being there"" as the sets and landscapes mesh with the actual places.  As an fledgling film critic, I give the film high marks with the proviso that some who abhor the study of history may not be as interested as I."

I always consider myself an Alamo buff and would recommend this movie as well as the others to anyone.

","There will always be comparisons between this film and John Wayne's bloated 1960 epic of the same name. The 2004 version is a much better film for a number of reasons. The acting in Hancock's Alamo is of a personal nature; Billy Bob Thornton's David Crockett is a man haunted by his own fame, Jason Patric's Jim Bowie wrestles with demons unleashed by his wife's death, and Patrick Wilson seeks desperately to find a new life amid the chaos of revolution. Dennis Quiad as the hard-drinking, self-destructive Sam Houston may be the one weak spot in the cast. Even the defenders of the Alamo look as if they belong in that crumbling mission on the edge of San Antonio de Bexar. A friend of mine noted that ""it looks like a made-for-TV movie,"" but he wasn't be especially critical of the film. What he meant, I believe, is that the normal scope and sweep of historical dramas was not present in this film. But the film did not suffer. Again, to pick on the Duke (and I'm a John Wayne fan), his Alamo certainly had vista galore; but the direction and story sat on its chest like a concrete block. Keep this in mind; the 1960 version is about a group of heroes valiantly defending their makeshift fort--the film seldom lets you forget that. Hancock's is about ordinary men in extra-ordinary circumstances where death is not some abstract thought. They are going to die and they are frightened."

His treatment of ""Apollo 13"" was nothing short of outstanding.  A few months ago, when the delay in release was announced, I found out Howard was no longer directing and the reins had been turned over to Hancock.  It was then I began to worry.  Sure enough, the obvious weakness in this film is the inconsistent direction and chopiness of the story.  On the other hand, the lead actors are all fantastic!  Patrick Wilson as Travis is just how the stories were told.  Jason Patric brings Jim Bowie (and is extremely impressive knife) to life.  Dennis Quaid does an OK job as Sam Houston, although maybe a bit heavy handed in his approach.  No question, though, that the movie and story belong to Billy Bob Thornton as Davy (he prefers David) Crockett and Emilio Echevarria as Santa Ana.  The arrogance of Santa Ana is chillingly portrayed and Billy Bob continues to prove that he is one of the best actors in the world.  He becomes his characters.  The crucial battle scene (portrayed accurately as being in the dark) is done fairly well, but the bravery and destiny of those involved is heart-breaking.  I would have loved to have seen Ron Howard's version, but am impressed with the accuracy of the storyline of Hancock's film."

","Want to see the most historically accurate film ever made about the Alamo? This is it, so true to the facts that the final battle takes place entirely in the dark, ending just before dawn, as the actual fight did. Not only that, Crockett is captured alive and executed later, likely the case in real life. Strong production values give this a striking and unglamorous look. Best of all is Billy Bob Thornton, who probably comes closer to recreating the real Crockett than any other actor ever has. (Sorry, Duke . . Fess). So much for the good stuff. Jason Patric is as dull and listless as Bowie as he has been in every other movie he's ever made, and Dennis Quaid is hardly the right person to capture the great Sam Houston. You might guess that in the PC age (that's political correctness, not personal computers), the role of Juan Seguin, Spanish defender of the Alamo, would be made focal and given to a top Latino actor (Antonio Banderas?) but he's still on the sidelines and played by an unknown. The real downfall, though, is that in trying for historical accuracy (and succeeding), the filmmakers failed to bring this alive as drama. Just one quick example of how poorly thought out the film is: Susannah Dickinson and her infant child are focused on throughout the film, but they forgot to let viewers know that they both survived the fight - they simply disappear! And while the Alamo battle is well staged, the follow up fight at San Jacinto is absurdly abbreviated and so plays as an anti-climax. Perhaps if Ron Howard had directed, as originally planned, with Russell Crowe opposite Billy Bob, this might've been one of the great ones."

","Unlikely to win the kind of critical kudos that befell Michael Cimino's initially much maligned ""Heaven's Gate"" on it's subsequent reassessment, John Lee Hancock's ""The Alamo"" is nevertheless a film ripe for re-evaluation with the passage of time. Whereas John Wayne's version of events was a sentimental, jingoistic hymn to the Republic Hancock takes a more critical, revisionist view that was unlikely to please post 9/11 audiences and yet this is a much more authentically heroic film than Wayne's cynical piece of political posturing. This is a naive, primitive picture whose heroes are little men writ large by history and whose sacrifice is all the more noble by it's very lack of forethought. On hindsight this is a perfect post 9/11 movie; the heroes of the twin towers were similarly 'little men' made great by an even more monstrous historical event. Consequently the film is genuinely moving. All the performances are first-rate, far eclipsing those of the original and it is visually superb (courtesy of Dean Semler's cinematography). It is also brilliantly directed and intelligently scripted. Indeed a triumph for all concerned and the most shamefully undervalued western since ""Heaven's Gate""."

"JAKastner","8","7","10","9 April 2004"," The Moose Hole - Review of The Alamo
","`Remember the Alamo!'<br/><br/>Sean Hannity, in his latest book `Deliver Us From Evil', said it best that, `Many of America's greatest moments have come when its people have taken up arms to defend liberty'. This statement can be applied to many memorable moments in American history ranging from the fight for independence in the American Revolution, the struggle for unity in the Civil War, and the rescuing of foreigners from brutal regimes in World War II, the War in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. And, yes, even at The Alamo, which is the topic of the above mentioned movie and this review. Due to events both at the time shortly after the fall of The Alamo and in the decades there after, the story of `The Last Stand' has been greatly misconstrued, with no help from the filmmakers in Hollywood who, then as they often do now, take `creative liberties' to make history more exciting and action packed then to express the true meanings of such memorable events. There is no doubt that many will be going into this film expecting admirable heroes, consistent gun-blazing action, and everything spelled out for them so that no actual thinking is required  For those expecting that, I am proud to say you will be deeply disappointed.<br/><br/>The story centers on a small group of settlers who barricade themselves within a former missionary church and do battle with a vast superior Mexican army, all in the name liberty from a vicious dictator. The tale of `The Alamo' really begins around the mid-1830s in a time when the Mexicans have won independence from Spain but their government has slipped from an unstable democracy into a militaristic dictatorship led by Generalissimo Antonio Miguel Lopez de Santa Anna. In those uncertain times, the Mexicans allowed travelers from the United States to settle in their lands and even encouraged it in order to bring the American dollar into their economy. By 1836, the number of Americans greatly outnumbered the Mexicans 4-to-1. Under the rule of Santa Anna, who would become known as the `Napoleon of the West', further restrictions were being passed on the settlers and consistent negotiations for an annexation of Texas to become a separate nation from both Mexico and the United States were continuously denied. Faced with an uncertain future for settlement and a fervent refusal to obey a totalitarian dictator, 300 men (along with their wives and children) fortify themselves within The Alamo, which was a former missionary church (one left uncompleted), faced against over a thousand Mexican soldiers led by Santa Anna who is determined to crush the colonial resistance no matter how many of his men he has to sacrifice to complete that task. The story for The Alamo is quite possibly one of the most historically accurate features in quite some time and definitely the most historical representation of the event presented on film, which isn't saying too much with the highly inaccurate John Wayne feature being the most popular one. Those who have a general understanding of the events leading up The Alamo as well as the central figures within the film will have a fare greater appreciation for the work done here then those coming in cut and dry.<br/><br/>Before discussing the group of talented actors who represent the central figures who stood and fought at The Alamo, one must know that the men represented in this film, in the event known as `The Last Stand', are not admirable men based on their pasts. Some are drunks, some are abandoners, and others are men chasing the shadows of what many expect them to be. But all that, as bad and undesirable as their situations may have been, does not matter in their courageous stand taken at The Alamo, where all fought and died for a cause they believed in and because of that nothing else can have hear-say. One of the most memorable highlights of the film, if not the greatest highlight, had to be the exuberant and well-fitted performance of Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett. Thornton gives a brilliant insight into a man who's own legend, which was often too much for him to bare, brought him to the Alamo and how he eventually found true meaning in his life because of it, though he had no true reason to be there in the first place. General Sam Houston, who was originally planned to be portrayed by Russell Crowe, is performed by Dennis Quaid who gives an admirable performance as well as the right tone of the character despite a couple of unadmirable qualities that plagued his place in history. And praise must be given to the casting director for picking an actual Mexican in the role of Santa Anna (wonderfully acted out by Emilio Echevarria) unlike Once Upon a Time in Mexico's choice of William Dafoe as a Mexican drug cartel which was clearly miscast.<br/><br/>Overall, Remember The Alamo for what it was  the courageous last stand of a group of individuals who saw Texas as a fresh new start away from the dishonorable lives they once lived and free from the oppressive rule of a totalitarian regime. As it was said once before, The Alamo is not for the average movie-goer who every-so-often finds an interest in a historical based drama. This one requires a much keener interest in the subject matter as well as a general knowledge of the events that led up to the event as well as ones that followed in its wake. Though the filmmakers try their best to keep the focus of the film in its historical context, occasionally they veer off course and slip into its mythological aspects, most notably the final scenes of Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, which, as aspirating as they may be, took away from the film's nearly flawless portrayal. Another minor complaint would be that the filmmakers did not focus too much on the events after the fall of The Alamo and the defeat of Santa Anna but with running time standing at slightly over two hours, one can see why they may have wanted to wrap it up at the point they did. The Alamo no doubt will have its critical, as well as public, hecklers but their criticism is reserved to the less knowledgeable area of their field that focuses only on what is on the surface and doesn't require supplemental insight into historical events."
"MartianOctocretr5","6","4","5","21 August 2006"," Superior battle engagement scenes; but the 1960 version was better
","It's an old dilemma with dramas based on historic events. Everybody knows what happened at the Siege of the Alamo. The question is how to present the events leading up to the inevitable; the 1960 version addressed that issue with deeper thought and sensitivity.<br/><br/>This version delivers less insight and background on Bowie, Crockett, Travis, and the other Alamo defenders than its predecessor. Nor does it tell you anything relevant about the invaders. What are these people (on both sides) fighting for and why are they willing to die for it? At first, it's hard to even differentiate which actor is playing which role. What little you do get suggests a sour, pessimistic view that the Alamo's defenders were just being stubborn and defiant in their defense of the fort, rather than have any ethical reasons for their actions. One scene even shows a lone survivor/prisoner mocking the victorious Mexican army after the Alamo has fallen. The line spoken here was meant to be.....what? Arrogant? Funny? Insulting? Defiant? It just comes off as being pathetic.<br/><br/>There are some interesting military battles, but the focus is solely on the guns, bombs, blood, gore, violence and destruction. Little is revealed about tactical strategy, or even casualties in the early skirmishes. The movie offers an all-too brief show of respect for the dead, showing one of them as a ghost playing a requiem song. The following engagement between Houston and Santa Ana is well-executed, but it's unnecessary in relating the Alamo story. <br/><br/>This movie is a decent watch, but you're better off with the 1960 version of ""The Alamo."""
"mlevans","9","4","5","6 October 2004"," Remember Hancock's Alamo!
","I now have TWO favorite versions of 'The Alamo.' While the John Wayne version will always hold a special place in my heart, I found myself completely captivated by the 2004 version.<br/><br/>Both have their strong points. The 1960 version still has its comfortable fit--like an old pair of shoes, ragged but comfy after all these years. Both have magnificent cinematography, great musical scores and memorable characterization. I didn't think anything could challenge my images of John Wayne/Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie/Richard Widmark and Laurance Harvey/William Travis. However, I have quickly (after two viewings) come to be quite fond of the Billy Bob Thornton/Crockett, Jason Patric/Bowie and Patrick Williams/Travis characters.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>When I first heard of 'The Alamo' being remade, I assumed it would probably be a politically correct diatribe against all things American. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it avoided both that direction and the myth enforcing of the Wayne version. I believe director John Lee Hancock struck a happy medium.<br/><br/>I am not enough of a historian of this time period or of the Alamo specifically to be sure just HOW historically accurate Hancock's rendition is. It is clearly closer to the surviving documentary evidence than Wayne's was, however. I like Thornton's interpretation of Crockett very much and agree that his ending was probably much closer to the truth than Wayne's. I am not sure if his actual words to Santa Ana were recorded by surviving soldiers or if they were Leslie Bohem's creation. There seems to be enough evidence, though, to suggest that the Tennessee congressman probably DID survive the actual battle, only to die at the hands of the Mexican troops. Crockett's plucky final moments are just as befitting to a legend as dying with his gun firing.<br/><br/>Speaking of gun(s) firing, Bowie's death was also memorable. Patric's ill (apparently dying) Bowie casts a much different light on the old knife-fighter than Widmark's interpretation. Again, though, there is no dishonor in firing with both hands from one's virtual deathbed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Williams' Travis is more human and much more likable than Harvey's. His rapscallion past was not brought out at all in Wayne's version. Yet his remarks to the men (minus his legendary line in the sand gesture) note that Texas was a new beginning for many of the men. His youth, more than his pomposity, is brought out in the 2004 version.<br/><br/>I especially like Thornton's Crockett. This seems to be a much more historically accurate Crockett than Wayne-as-Crockett. In this version he is an ex-congressman, interested in getting in on the ground floor of a new nation--one he understands already has its fighting behind it. Only reluctantly is he dragged into a war. I think this is a very feasible explanation. Again, this Crockett does nothing to dishonor the legend. It merely attempts to separate man from legend. Like Daniel Boone, Crockett actually lived to see himself become a world-wide celebrity, with books and a theater production hugely exaggerating his exploits as a woodsman and fighter. Despite his desire for safety and privacy, he realized that his reputation meant something to many people--and he was willing to fight and die to protect it. Again, I think this is a very believable interpretation of Crockett. I certainly loved his gutsy answer to the Mexican army, playing their infamous 'cutthroat' battle song right back at them with his fiddle. Hancock was right in replaying this moment of the battle at the very end of the film.<br/><br/>Speaking of the end, like 'Pearl Harbor,' the film does not end with the fall of the Alamo. It follows Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) and Santa Ana (played with wonderful aplomb by Emilio Echevarria) through the decisive Battle of San Jacinto. Unlike 'Pear Harbor,' this technique works. Rather than water down the product like the former did, this sequence puts the Battle of the Alamo in perspective.<br/><br/>Overall, I would call Hancock's Alamo a real winner. I just wish I had gotten to enjoy John O'Connor and Dean Semler's stunning cinematography and Carter Burwell's musical score on the big screen. O'Connor and Semler worked magic, with gorgeous sunsets, colorful uniforms and the hauntingly quiet, powerful images of the quietly advancing Mexican army during its final nighttime assault. The image of a lone bayonet advancing through the darkness will always be with me.<br/><br/>Wayne's version will always be a classic and a comfortable fit. Hancock's Alamo, though, is a truly superb film. This Alamo is certainly worth 'remembering.'"
"PsycoSnow","Null","4","5","5 May 2004"," My theories of why people didn't like the Alamo
","I'm not quite sure why everyone (with the exception of a few) is labeling this as ""the worst movie ever'. I have two theories:<br/><br/>Only a Texan could really understand the significance of the Alamo. I have noticed that nearly all of the negative reviews come from people who don't live in Texas. This leads me to believe that the negative reviewers, from other parts, either don't know the whole story of the Alamo, or don't really care. If you don't care about the Alamo, then why did you go see it in the first place? But realize that if the Alamo hadn't been fought then Texas might have never gotten its independence from Santa Anna, and therefore may have never joined the United States. If you don't know the whole truth, don't act like you do. I have read several reviews that compare this movie with the 1960 John Wayne movie. I personally have nothing wrong with John Wayne, but the fact is that the 1960 make had many historic inaccuracies, so please don't compare the two. And don't try to make a review about lame parts of the movie, for it is coming straight from history. So, by calling part of this movie lame, you are calling history lame. And something that I read in an article in the Statesman (Austin paper) is that I think people have just been waiting for a chance to say 'Forget the Alamo'.<br/><br/>People don't like it because it doesn't portray the characters in the stereotypical way that the myth does, but remains historically accurate. Many times people mention that the movie doesn't show the characters as the heroes that they were. If this is true then fighting to the last man even when all is lost, is in no way courageous or heroic. Hancock lets you see the internal lives and struggles of those at the Alamo, which makes their deaths even more touching.<br/><br/>I understand that people are titled to their opinions, but when they insult the history of Texas, I take it personally! Don't mess with Texas!!!"
"c-h-graham-1","Null","4","5","24 April 2004"," Historically accurate, historically unmarketable
","This film is perhaps the most fulfilling and detailed story of the quintisential American hallmark of bravery and heroism.  And yet while the story nearly writes itself, Disney has made the near-fatal error of misreading their audience.  Very few, if anyone, wants to see a movie graphically illustrating the death of americans, famous or otherwise, in a hopeless battle.  ""The Alamo"" is a great film about a topic that many people try to avoid exposing themselves to: Americans locked in a battle they know they cannot win.<br/><br/>There is another Dennis Quaid film called ""Come see the Paradise"" about the American government's unlawful detainment of asian-americans during World War II.  While historically accurate (and an important story that every american should read and know), most Americans avoid intentionally exposing themselves to aggressive and shameful moments in their history.  ""The Alamo"" is a tough sell because the entire film is contaminated with the truth that all the characters within the Alamo's walls are killed, some of them horribly so.  No one wants to see that, even if it IS american history."

","I was expecting a little more from this film, but it really didn't start to take off until more than hour into the picture.  Most historical films take some liberties with thought-provoking statements and/or comic relief.  This film, however, simply delivered factual rhetoric for the first hour.  It wasn't until the second hour that the actors seemed to get into character and the story really picked up.<br/><br/>I will probably research some of the scenes that I saw to see how ""accurate"" they may or may not have been.  It was the end sequence that I was really waiting for.  I know from history that the final battle ended in a matter of minutes.  Supposedly the reason for this was that Santa Anna took a nap every day around 4pm.  Houston became of aware of this and launched his attack right after 4pm, catching the Mexican leader literally asleep at the switch.  I didn't really see anything to prove or disprove this fact in the film.  It would have been nice to see, however.<br/><br/>Overall, a watchable film.  I will give it an 8/10 mostly for the excellent sets and costumes.  The acting was good, but more could have been done to enhace the script."
"mizshely2003","10","4","5","10 April 2004"," Great performances, choppy editing
","I enjoyed the film although the choppy editing made for a small amount of confusion and robbed a potentially great film of its continuity. Billy Bob Thornton should get an Oscar nod for his performance as David Crockett and Patrick Wilson as William Barrett Travis was able to bring many dimensions to a very stilted character. Dennis Quaid's egocentric Sam Houston was something of a caricature, but many non-Texans view Mr. Huston in just such a historic light.<br/><br/>I thought the film failed in its attempt to show the fight for the Alamo as a civil war, of sorts, comprised of a mixed bag of soldiers fighting on each side. In the current theatrical release, Santa Ana is portrayed as a foppish Napoleon, but there is very little development of the other Mexican characters. On the other hand, David Crockett, Colonel Travis, and Jim Bowie are fairly well fleshed out, as are many supporting roles. If the film is to give a truly rounded portrayal of the events, it needs to balance the character development of the people inside the Alamo with more information about the soldier's in Santa Ana's army."

","I went into this film not expecting to like it but I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a little too long and it drags in parts but, unlike other films on the Alamo, this one fits with the histories that I have read on the battle.  It is also not a one-sided view.  Most of the Mexicans are shown as plain men and not the villains that are seen in other films.  The one exception is Santa Anna who is shown as the b**tard he was.  The portrayals of the major characters seem to be right on the money.  I was especially impressed with Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of Davy Crockett.  It is always difficult to portray a legend but Thornton does it in a manner that lets you see the man behind the legend.<br/><br/>The cinematography was exceptional, especially in the battle scenes.<br/><br/>In short, it is a film well worth seeing."

The fact that the sentry's were exhausted and asleep then the final assault began.

","Admittedly, having been born in Austin and raised near Houston, I'm a bit biased. And being born on April 9, I had to go see the movie the second it came out! What a birthday gift! Still, I really liked this film - it's far superior to the John Wayne and Fess Parker takes on the Alamo.<br/><br/>The directing could use some work; there are far too many close-ups of the actors' faces. The film could also stand to be a bit shorter. I daresay those are ""The Alamo""'s only major flaws. I don't think there was a bad actor in the picture. Perhaps the screenwriters' got things wrong with their characterizations, but the actors did exactly what those writers told them to do. Superb. The Dallas Morning Star reviewer called it intellectual and compassionate - I'm not sure those are the words I would use to describe the movie, but I won't argue with him. As far as intellectualism goes, the character development was perfect - most movies are sufficiently lacking in that department, yet it's really easy to spend too much time on character development. Even with at least five major characters to track, this movie walked that fine line perfectly.<br/><br/>I don't know how accurate it is historically. With a few notable exceptions such as ""Thirteen Days"" and ""Inherit the Wind"", Hollywood routinely blows off history. It was nice to see the Col. Travis line in the sand legend ignored, as well as to see all our larger than life characters portrayed as fully human (which to me makes them that much more heroic). Also, the battle of San Jacinto was very well done. Perhaps that scene was a bit cliched, but I'm speaking in terms of accuracy with this paragraph.<br/><br/>Since the movie only came out today, I won't spoil anything (obviously, the Alamo was a massacre but we kicked butt at San Jacinto - just like the Titanic sank. I mean I won't spoil any style specifics). I will say that, despite some critics' disapproval, I liked the way Davey Crockett went out. It wasn't quite John Wayne and the ammo dump, but it was every bit as heroic. The scene with his violin was great, as well. Both of them, come to think of it. I wouldn't ever think to cast Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crockett, but he pulled it off. He took some getting used to, but after the first half hour or so I could see it. Dennis Quaid would have been more appropriate as either Col. Travis or Col. Bowie, but he worked as Sam Houston, as well.<br/><br/>Is $7.50 too much for a movie ticket? Perhaps. But if any movies are worth the price of admission, this one certainly ranks among them, especially given a lot of the crap out there made purely for money.<br/><br/>God bless Texas!"

","I went and saw a sneak preview of THE ALAMO last night, and it was entertaining. Whether it is a correct historical view is yet to be determined, but it has a nice cast of characters. It is a mixture of war, comedy, drama, and romance. Billy Bob Thornton play Daniel Boone, and provides most of the funny one-liners of the movie. Dennis Quaid plays an alcoholic General, Sam Houston. The battle scenes were very realistic, and this makes up for the rather lengthy and slow plot. I would recommend reading up on your Alamo history, for it may be beneficial when viewing the movie, it was for me.  It is worth seeing, but don't expect too much, for you will most assuredly be disappointed."

","Excellent Film,<br/><br/>I can't imagine a film like this getting poor reviews  I guess the craft and its significance is a bit beyond the understanding of the current generation and those who are into movies featuring morons like Paris Hilton or Snoop Doggie Dogg. But this is an important film that has been very well done. I've watched it three of four times - once with the historical commentary. Each time I'm impressed with not only the effort it took to make such a film but the historical significance of the story it tells. The film is superbly directed, acted, filmed, and is the closest historically we're bound to see. Billy Bob Thornton's performance is beyond great as are the other main characters. In fact, I can't think of any actor that did do an outstanding job including the little boy who witnessed Crockett's final moments. It is one of the few films I couldn't wait to own on DVD. I easily give this film an A+ .<br/><br/>Michael Sear"

","I liked this version of The Alamo as much as I liked all previous ones, Last Command, The Alamo (John Wayne Version), Alamo (made for TV) and Gone to Texas. The story of how the Texians annexed the US and detached Mexico is one of bravery and courage of both Texians and Texicanos against a superior force. This version does introduce a more introspective David Crockett in the form of comic actor Billy Bob Thorton who captures much of the real David Crockett's humor in irony and introspection. David Crockett in the Billy Bob Thorton interpretation is more a captive of his public image than the Mexican forces surrounding the Alamo.<br/><br/>All the US versions since Last Command have treated the Mexican view in an honorable manner. This particular version adopts the Mexican account that Crockett survived the battle but was executed thereafter.<br/><br/>The failure of this version was in the inability to explain clearly Jim Bowies' personal devastation and in its neglect of the heroine of the Alamo legend Mrs Susan Dickenson who knitted the Texian flag in Mexican colors with the legend 1824 for the --- gasp --- liberal ---gasp --- constitution that Santa Ana usurped."

","I just rented it and very much enjoyed it. It is extremely difficult, especially nowadays, to make a historical movie without offending someone. ""Extremists"" from both sides will find something to dislike about this movie. Hence the many bad reviews from the mainstream media who, no doubt, disliked the portrayal of the butcher, Santa Anna. From the other side, some may not like the depiction of the American ""heroes"", especially Davy Crockett. (Thornton is not your John Wayne Crockett) But for anyone interested in a beautifully filmed, well acted, presentation of an important event in American/Mexican history, you will enjoy the film. My problems with the film. 1)Although the Constitution of 1824 is mentioned, its importance in the rebellion is not fully explained. Hollywood seems to always have problems depicting the reasons people rebel. (See Braveheart/The Patriot) 2) A couple of just plain silly scenes. (e.g. Travis suggesting the dying Bowie leave the fort just before the final attack). But nothing major. It is a shame that this movie did not get the attention it deserved."

","This movie is flawed, no doubt about it. Maybe it was just all the negative press I heard prior to viewing (low expectations might be the answer); but I found myself enjoying the movie. Billy Bob is engaging as ever; Patrick Wilson was strong as Travis; the music by Carter Burwell was moving; and the fighting was mercifully not drawn out - plus the movie really made no bad guys out of either side. While some of the dialog is stilted, a case could be made that talk of that kind wasn't that unusual at the time, and that flowery speech was the rule of the day (although maybe not around rough frontiersman).<br/><br/>It reminded me of other like movies that received similar negative to average reviews - e.g. The Patriot, Gods and Generals etc. It's probably just a history thing, but I probably will not mind watching it again if the chance arises."
"greggldavis","9","2","2","3 April 2017"," I was impressed by the realism of this film
","I just happened to start watching this movie and was immediately struck by how restrained it was. It didn't go over the top in either direction, either making the historical figures larger than life OR turning them into complete jerks or anti-heroes. It just let them be human beings--not quite average human beings, but human beings nonetheless.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT I started reading up on Bowie before the movie reached the point of his death and learned that the movie depicted the most likely scenario, that he died sick in bed trying to defend himself with his pistols. But the film didn't try to turn this into some last stand of blazing glory where he takes out a dozen or more enemy soldiers before falling. Bowie manages to shoot just one or two soldiers before he's overwhelmed and slaughtered.<br/><br/>Crockett's death was probably more dramatized--from what I read it's more likely he died during the battle than from being captured then executed (but not before getting in a couple of digs at Santa Anna). Still, even that scene doesn't overwork the dramatics too much."
"dhrice","8","2","2","7 August 2016"," An Emotional Experience
","I just finished revisiting this film, and despite some lingering quarrels with Davy Crockett's cheesy death scene and Dennis Quaid's overheated portrayal of Sam Houston, this movie is a wonderfully emotional experience for me as a native Texan. The macho and occasionally corny 1960 version with John Wayne, Laurence Harvey and Richard Widmark is, in my opinion, far inferior to this film. John Lee Hancock did a brilliant job of portraying the haunting fears and nagging doubts that the doomed and selfless defenders surely felt when they faced the grim reality that they were surrounded and alone. He also tried to hew pretty closely to the historic facts while engaging in the inevitable amount of dramatic license required for a Hollywood feature. I cringed when I heard that Billy Bob Thornton was cast as Davy Crockett, but he was a very pleasant surprise. His twangy Southern accent was a perfect fit for the role. The other pleasant discovery was the Hispanic actor who played Juan Seguin. This well-known Texas history story passed into the realm of heroic legend long ago, and that makes it difficult to portray without disappointing lots of viewers and history buffs who have rigid expectations. I give full credit to native Texan Hancock for even taking it on. The final siege sequence is visually stunning, inspiring, overwhelming, and heartbreaking. And the coda at San Jacinto provides an emotional catharsis. Great music score as well. I wish Hancock had been better served by a couple of the main performances, but I remain a fan of this film."
"tomsview","7","2","2","4 September 2013"," Remember this Alamo?
","Was another version of the Alamo a good idea? Judging by the box office results the answer is no, but this one professed lofty intentions, to make it as close to the real story as possible, with just a few changes here and there.<br/><br/>According to the earliest publicity, the decision to make another Alamo movie was born from the alarming state of world affairs, and the desire to remind Americans how they had made sacrifices in the past for ideals they believed in.<br/><br/>Whatever the motivation, the filmmakers had to overcome the problem that movies set in the early 19th century are often stuffily costumed and talky. As one commentator said, the Alamo era is a bit like Charles Dickens meets the Old West.<br/><br/>The 1960 version overcame the problem with three high profile stars – John Wayne, Richard Widmark and Laurence Harvey as Colonels Crockett, Bowie and Travis respectively. However, the makers of this version, which is beautifully crafted in every department, went for characters that seem overwhelmed by events, but in the process they may have made them a little too lacklustre. <br/><br/>Even the music set the tone for the two versions; Carter Burwell's elegant but restrained score versus Dimitri Tiomkin's mighty opus for the 1960 version. <br/><br/>Thanks to the movies, Australians also have a fair idea about the events at the Alamo. Like Americans we watched Fess Parker's Davy Crockett go down swinging Old Betsy, and then John Wayne go out with a bang a few years later – not forgetting Arthur Hunnicutt as Davy in ""The Last Command"" who has the best line in any Alamo movie when he says to Sterling Hayden's Jim Bowie before the Mexican assault, ""They'll eat snakes before they get in here Jim"".<br/><br/>Those earlier films inspired me to read Walter Lord's ""A Time to Stand"", which still holds up as an even-handed history of the event. I also became aware of the controversy over whether Davy Crockett was executed after surrendering or went down fighting as he had done in film after film.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton plays Davy in an anti-heroic fashion. His Crockett is likable and his performance is a thoughtful one – whether it is the performance that was needed is debatable.<br/><br/>Sam Houston, played by Dennis Quaid, appoints William Travis and Jim Bowie to defend the Alamo with a small garrison against the Mexicans. Travis is played by Patrick Wilson and although youthful looking, gives one of the best performances in the film. Jason Patric plays Jim Bowie, who like Crockett is weighed down with his status as a living legend; he also engages in an intense rivalry with Travis.<br/><br/>The Mexican army arrives many thousands strong. Santa Anna, played by Emilio Echevarría in the manner of a demented mafia don, orders that the mission be captured and the defenders destroyed. After days of bombardment, Travis informs the garrison that they can expect no relief, and that any man who wishes to escape is free to go. None leave and the Texans are all killed during the battle – except Davy Crockett who is taken prisoner, proves defiant, and is executed.<br/><br/>The depiction of the final battle is the most accurate of any version. Played out at night, the long sequence features a breathtaking panorama of the Mexicans closing in on the Alamo.<br/><br/>Although the film ends with Sam Houston's victory at San Jacinto, it cannot overcome the attempts to cut the legend down to size. If this was the filmmaker's goal, they succeeded all too well. But in so doing, surely they fell short of fulfilling their expressed wish to create a film to provide inspiration during a time of crisis and stress. If they are looking for the reasons why the movie failed, it could be as simple as that."
"rtolchard","9","2","2","5 September 2010"," Thoughtful and emotionally truthful historical epic
","I can't understand why this film aroused so much negative criticism when it came out, because it is head and shoulders above the John Wayne version, which makes the assumption that everyone knows about this and believes in the Texan cause before the film even gets going. I am British, and therefore outside the whole myth-making process that surrounds this story, but even I was caught up in a film that tried to depict events and characters as they really were, and that created a much more emotionally moving depiction in the process. For weeks after I saw it, I read everything I could around the story, which must say something about the impact of the film. The best part for me was the visual detail and the attention to the creation of a believable social and cultural backdrop against which the story emerged; I particularly liked Jim Bowie's sister-in-law fetching a folk-healer to help him, and his memories of the gracious, exotic, Tejano society into which he entered when he married his wife. <br/><br/>I also found Travis's stiff-necked, unappealing integrity entirely credible from an emotional point of view in relation to his recorded actions, and Davy Crockett's fiddle variations on the ramparts has added a new tale to his continuing legend. Santa Ana came across as a pompous, capricious twit - which was borne out by everything I subsequently read about him.<br/><br/>I have failed to give it a 10 because I would have preferred it to have been made as a mini-series, which would have allowed for more character development and more pursuit of some of the stories of the different characters."
"Robert_duder","6","2","2","25 June 2005"," An okay Epic
","This particular period epic seems to be the popular one to hit the gong for. I heard nothing but bad reviews and people's nasty comments. I had always looked forward to seeing it regardless because I like historical epics and there has been some less than stellar ones as of late. The Alamo didn't disappoint me at all. In fact I thought it was very heartfelt and real rendition of the circumstances surrounding the infamous battle. John Lee Hancock uses the characters sparingly and makes a movie all about the battle which is really what it's about. Despite there being some significant characters he takes a different approach by not being afraid of making them second to the infamous battle itself.<br/><br/>The Alamo is the historical story of Texas, before it was Texas. The Americans want the land as does the Mexicans and the only thing standing between them is the small fort of The Alamo, a strategically placed, vitally important abandoned mission where a rag tag group of countrymen have been sent to hold up against thousands of Mexican soldiers led by the Mexican leader himself Santa Anna. Among the American group are infamous historical figures Congressman David (Davey Crockett) and Jim Bowie determined to free Texas and make it part of the United States.<br/><br/>The highlight of acting to me in this film is Billy Bob Thorton, a man that I'm not crazy about in his personal life but nonetheless is one hell of an actor. He portrays the now aging Congressman Davey Crockett. He plays the man with such emotion and intensity and as an audience he's the character you feel the most compassion for. He seems wise, and experienced and you can't help but feel like you're in the presence of a legend. Jason Patric also does a good job as the ailing and dying Jim Bowie. He shows strength and hostility as quickly as he shows compassion and weakness. Despite this films apparently numerous historical inaccuracies I still think this film captures this time period and this battle better than most epics do. I think the inaccuracies are ignorable considering the work that Hancock did with the characters and the battle. Despite these characters importance and most of the film spent building them up, he doesn't hesitate to drop them quickly and unemotionally to the spoils of war. It's shocking and makes you snap back when you see someone who has been a main character for the last two hours eliminated in literally seconds. He also focus' in not only on the American side but we see the fear and desperation in the eyes of the Mexican troops. With this different approach to the period piece it does lose a little of what might be dramatic story and therefore does make it drag more than one would like. Also Dennis Quaid, who is one of my favorite actors, is pointless and misused in this film and despite his battle being important, nonetheless feels tacked on and useless by the time it comes around. His character is vapid and has no depth whatsoever. I really do think anyone who loves history or epics will really enjoy watching this. It won't blow you away but there is enough in it to satisfy and I enjoyed watching it.<br/><br/>6/10"

The person who played Travis seemed awfully young for the role. Both Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie were well done although I miss the traditional scene where the ""line is drawn in the Sand"" to divide those who want leave  and those who want to stay and fight ,and dying Jim Bowie begs them to carry him over to the ""stay and fight side'! The scenes of the Alamo being stormed were good, but somehow to me the movie lacked pazazz! Instead of ending with the deaths of  the defenders, we went on to see Sam Houston defeat Santa Ana on the banks of the San Jacinto River and no credit was given the defenders of the Alamo for the 5 days that their defense had given Houston to prepare. Santa Ana was portrayed as something of a  cartoon figure."

","I had heard so many people saying how lousy this movie was...I waited to see it when it hit pay-per-view. I don't know where those people got their ideas about the history of the Alamo. I thought there were fine portrayals by everyone involved in this movie. I truly enjoyed it. Since I am a born and bred Texan, and a proud one at that...but aren't all Texans? Watch this movie and realize the sacrifice that was made at this place that is the shrine of Texas history and you will know why we have such pride in our state and the blood that bought it. <br/><br/>Hey, there are only 2 kinds of people..Texans and the ones that wish they were:) That being said...<br/><br/>This movie showed the true tale of some 180 men that knew the score, knew how outnumbered they were, but knew what was at stake. In the style of the true heroes that they were they defended a mission turned fort called the Alamo, Spanish for dogwood. In fact the Alamo now lies in the middle of downtown San Antonio. I only wish the movie had put more emphasis on Santa Anna's slaughter at Goliad of Col. Fannin and his 300 fellow Texian fighters.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was well acted and quite realistic. These brave men held the Mexican army, of some 5000, for 13 days. Pretty staggering odds 185 to 5000! Yet they were still able to persevere those 13 days in the spring of 1836. Their deaths were not in vain. They were able to hold off the Mexican army long enough to give Sam Houston the time he needed to prepare for the onslaught. Another person that reviewed this movie, quite well I would say...except for the last paragraph...<br/><br/>""The filmmakers get a little nutty in the final act, which tacks on a 'Pearl Harbor' climax that has the film going beyond the Alamo just so it can climax on an American victory. This type of silly ending isn't warranted, and needlessly draws out the film way past its expiration date. The story of 'The Alamo' should've just stayed at the Alamo, and let the history books tell the rest of the story""<br/><br/>I believe it is only right to inform the people that aren't blessed enough to be in Texas....we lost the fight...but we won the war! The battle took place at an area now called San Jacinto, which lies just to the east of Houston. That battle indeed lasted only 18 minutes...and out of the several hundred troops belonging to Santa Anna that died that day, only 6 Texans died! I believe that 'the rest of the story' as Paul Harvey likes to say it, had to be acknowledged. Especially since Sam Houston was being shown leading his army and being unable to respond to the plea for help that came from Travis at the Alamo. <br/><br/>I feel pride in the fact that a bunch of rag tag men from all walks of life, backgrounds, education and race stood together in a fight for Texas' freedom. Travis who was well educated to Crockett who was a larger than life legend, a senator and a woodsman from Tennessee. From the slaves who stood and fought to the Hispanics that also risked their lives...like Juan Seguin who delivered Travis' letter for aid to Sam Houston. What a great honor to these heroes, ordinary people put into am extraordinary situation. But then, that truly is what any hero is. Truly.....Remember the Alamo! <br/><br/>Find a little known song by Marty Robbins called 'The Ballad of the Alamo' that played in John Wayne's version of the Alamo. Hey, I was raised on this stuff. Nothing against this version of the story either, its fantastic. Also on the soundtrack is a rendition of DeGuello, the music that the Mexican army plays...meaning 'no quarter'. It is a hauntingly beautiful melody considering its meaning."
"TxMike","Null","3","4","14 October 2004"," Good movie for anyone wanting a dramatization of battles fought for Texas' independence.
","I live pretty near Washington, Tx, where the Republic of Texas began almost 200 years ago. The park, Washington on the Brazos, has a remarkable visitor center with displays which tell the story of Texas. This movie, The Alamo, was made by Texans to show, as accurately and entertainingly as possible, the fall of The Alamo to Santa Anna, followed closely by the eventual defeat of same by Sam Houston to secure Texas' independence from Mexico. Santa Anna saved his life by agreeing to sign away the territory. Dennis Quaid, a native Houstonian, plays Sam Houston very effectively. Billy Bob Thornton is a hoot as Davy Crockett, violinist and sharpshooter, and spinner of tall tales. Overall a very satisfying movie for anyone who is interested in the subject.<br/><br/>The DVD's sound and picture are first rate. The extras are worth seeing. During the filming of the Alamo scenes and battles, the extras were asked to look over a list of all those who died defending the Alamo, and pick an actual person to portray. Some of the extras actually descended from those deceased hero's, and played their own great grandfather or distant uncle. When you see the scene in the movie, you can see it on their faces. They were not 'just extras', they were standing in the place of those real hero's, and it made a difference."

","I enjoy historical dramas and I have to include ""The Alamo"" on the list.  It made me read up on a bit of history about the Alamo and was surprised to learn no one knew for sure the actual events of the fall of the Alamo.  The surviving members of the Mexican Army gave varying accounts.  So the filmmakers here had to naturally engage in some speculation as to what transpired.  I found their choices plausible.<br/><br/>The reason Mexico lost a large portion of its territory was due in large part to it and its army being led by a megalomaniacal dandy.<br/><br/>I want to give praise to Billy Bob Thornton's portrayal of David Crockett, America's first celebrity.  It is sensitive, smart and brave.<br/><br/>One sad consequence of this movie's release has been to bring forth from the slime loathsome racists to infest imdb's message boards.  To them, US crimes against humanity is justified because of all the great stuff Americans eventually invented.  Ironic really in the context of the Alamo as the ""Texians"" were seeking an independent nation apart from the US as well as Mexico."

"flickmanic","5","4","6","7 October 2006"," Noble failure
","A much anticipated updating of the Alamo story touted to be historically accurate in every respect. A very tall order for a topic which to this day motivates extreme passions. In brief, the production team tried to do too much. The subject matter required a long running time to set up the plot, which today is much less understood - or misunderstood (!) than when John Wayne's film neatly followed Republic's ""The Last Command"" and Disney's Davy Crockett shows. Randy Quaid's Sam Houston, and the post-climax Battle of San Jacinto were poor choices. Old Samjacinto - and the film - would have been better served by a briefer cameo like that provided by Richard Boone in the 1960 version. Clearly the most compelling character in this offering was Thornton's Crockett; not surprising since he's the defender most written about by Alamofiles. Frankly Thornton's performance is the only element raising this production to 5-star. It is superb and really captures the essence of Crockett as described in various histories. The title should have been ""Davy Crockett at the Alamo,"" but perhaps would have needed Disney's paid release. Even the Alamo set, proclaimed in pre-production hype to be historically accurate in all details fell short. Most disappointing, as set designers reduced the size of the courtyard in front of the chapel; I suppose for photography purposes. Wayne's production did the same, in an even more inaccurate rendition of the mission. Finally, a production like this really, really needed a Sam Peckinpaw to accurately depict the savagery of the final battle. Mexican accounts (the only reliable eye-witness ones) are pretty clear and self-damning as to the butchery that took place. According to their written reports and letters, the real battle was even more brutal than the final shootout in The Wild Bunch; but I suppose needed to be cut short to make time for San Jacinto, and to avoid violating PC rules whereby savagery not imposed by Anglo-Saxons must be muted or eliminated altogether. Watch this one for Thornton and when he's not on the screen fast forward with the remote!!"
"flickershows","7","4","6","2 January 2005"," Yeah, I'll Remember It
","I missed my chance to see 'The Alamo' on the big screen in April 2004 because it tanked so quickly. And while this isn't a grinning endorsement, you might want to rent the DVD and give it a spin. First of all, the disc itself is terrific, from a technical perspective. It looks good (Dean Semler and John O'Connor share the cinematography credit) and sounds great. 'The Alamo' is a solid western about a big-time American failure---and, then later, a success---down in 19th century Texas.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock's version of this story waves its flags and sometimes panders in patriotism, but it isn't dull...which is the ultimate cinematic sin. John Wayne's (very dull) 1960 Oscar-baiter featured himself as Davy Crockett, but this modern telling has Billy Bob Thornton playing the man in the coonskin cap. Thornton is introspective, multi-skilled, courageous, funny...and the best thing in the entire movie. When Davy Crockett leaves the picture, the movie might as well be over.<br/><br/>The main character, actually, is Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid). With a ""Remember The Alamo"" battle cry, he leads a vengeful charge against the Mexicans that climaxes the film. Other than that, the glowering Quaid is hardly around. Jason Patric has a showy role as Jim Bowie, dying of consumption at the famously over-matched fort, but armed for a fight anyway. Patrick Wilson (as Bowie's rival) and Emilio Echevarria (as Mexico's General Santa Anna) also have major roles.<br/><br/>'The Alamo' is somber. It's different than westerns from 50 or 70 years ago, which were more of the carefree ""yee-haw"" variety. These days, cowboys always have a sense of gloom & doom. It's a common affliction in modern movies, but at least the whole point of THIS film is that defending the fort was always going to be a tragically futile act. Apart from that, I can't tell you anything else about this legendary story. They seem to have gotten it right."

Now that it is out, I can tell you that it was worth the wait. This is a very well done film based on the siege of the Alamo in 1836.  It is amazing that they didn't film it at the real Alamo because the recreation is terrific.  This version is different from the 1960 John Wayne version which was long and long winded.  This movie does not give in to too many speeches about republic.  Of the cast, Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as Davy Crockett.  His Davy Crockett is seen as a three dimensional character that is not entirely heroic.  Davy Crockett has trouble with his own legend and trying to live up to that legend, even if it costs him his life.  Jim Bowie and William Travis are also treated as relatively unheroic people who are slave owners and are looking for a new life in Texas.

I live in Bonham and the Hispanic was suppost to be James Butler Bonham. I really don't Appreciate the film director changing history. I am really angered at this and i'm sure my whole town is too. Other then that this movie was great. I like the end where the Hispanics got a beating just as bad as ours.

","Having endured this inaccurate movie I will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions. Yet, it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it. Davy Crockett was very poorly represented by Billy Bob, who I thought would have probably been better cast as Sam Houston given both men's love of oratory. I think self-absorbed Dennis Quaid(an actual Texan) would have been a perfect Crockett and it would have definitely fed into his starved sense of self-worship. As a Texan and a true believer in the Texas mindset I feel Davy Crockett was the quintessential Texan even though not born here. Our unofficial motto is ""It ain't braggin' if it is a fact"" was made for Crockett. And that last scene at the Alamo where Crockett is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to Davy Crockett ever made. To even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous. Three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead Mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat. Finally, that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of San Jacinto as a mutual battle of 600 Texicans vs 700 Mexican Soldiers when there was actually closer to 1,500 well trained Mexican regulars. Every Texas school kid who pays attention in their first Texas history class knows the battle took the Mexican Army by surprise during siesta time and the Mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and fled as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand."

","For you American history film buffs, this is a must see. The movie & the top billed stars do a great job bringing back to life some of the most colorful personalities of American history from the early to mid 19th century. Even if history isn't your thing, this film is an above-average production & worth the 2 hours or so of running time.<br/><br/>Personally, I think Billi Bob Thornton (who plays Davy Crockett) ALMOST stole the show. (Dennis Quaid put in another superb performance as General Sam Houston).<br/><br/>I watched this movie on DVD. You'll have an even greater appreciation for this film if you watch the special features. For instance, the movie was filmed on location in Texas (which wouldn't be that unusual, except that many American/historical movies of late are being filmed overseas --e.g. ""Cold Mountain""). Most of the extras (that play the 180 -or so defenders of the Alamo) are native Texans and many of the extras can trace their great, great grandparents as the actual persons that died defending the fort/mission. Also note, Dennis Quaid grew up in the Texas city named after Sam HOUSTON.<br/><br/>Check it out!"
"rmax304823","7","4","7","30 April 2005"," Surrender is not an option. (?)
","In World War II many Japanese soldiers fought according to the Samurai's code of Bushido, the way of the warrior, battling to the last man and committing sepuku rather than surrendering. And then there's the kamikaze business.<br/><br/>The response of Americans to this was one of mixed contempt and bewilderment. Repeatedly, we still hear on TV documentaries some variation on the expression, ""The Japanese fought to die for their country. We wanted to live for ours."" It was said that banzai attacks were made by soldiers crazed by drugs or hopped up on saki. ""Fanatics,"" we called them.<br/><br/>We have in this movie a reflection of that ethos, only here they are called heroes because they're on ""our"" side. It's never convincingly explained why they threw their lives away. Maybe, for any number of reasons, they wanted to exchange fire with the Mexicans -- ""The drunk delight of battle with my peers.""<br/><br/>I know that's a discomforting thought. In behavioral science it's called the social construction of reality.<br/><br/>It's a well-done movie. Hancock is an efficient and perceptive director. The script is more thoughtful and less condescending than John Wayne's version of the story, and the acting is better too, particularly Billy Bob Thornton, who is an amazingly versatile actor. As Davy Crockett his flabby and expressive face radiates a gleam of mischief and irony most of the time, while at other moments he seems to be contemplating a bust of Homer. He's outstanding. Dennis Quaid is good too, an actor who always brings something interesting to each performance -- as Sam Houston, a husky voice and determined frown -- but he's not on screen that much.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are well staged. The script gives all of the Americans and their compadres a courage touched by doubt. It also treats the Mexican soldiers as human beings. (It's a good thing our neighbors to the south aren't North Koreans or Iranians, eh?) But there is a heavy -- Santa Ana. A real grease ball of a heavy too, with an unprepossessing face painted like a corpse in a funeral parlor, thin lips, an arrogant sneer, and a complete disregard for the lives of his men or anybody else. ""What are the lives of soldiers? They are like chickens."" Needless to say, any legitimate claims Mexico might have had on Texas aren't gone into.<br/><br/>And yet this is an improvement over John Wayne's 1960 rendering. In the earlier film, the Americans are mostly comic figures playing lowbrow tricks on one another -- if you want to start a fight you have to knock a feather off your opponent's nose. Wayne's men all die super heroic deaths, with a mortally wounded Wayne deliberately blowing up an ammunition magazine, taking himself and dozens of the enemy with him. It's not exactly a ""kamikaze"" death but it will do. In this more recent movie, the men die for the most part just like everybody else inside the walls, except for Crockett who disdainfully invites the Mexican soldiers to perform their variation of harikiri on him.<br/><br/>The special effects deserve mention too. I really don't know much about the Alamo or the military technology of the time but it's interesting to see cannonballs with fuzes, which sometimes sputter out. The camera even shows us the point of view of a Mexican cannonball soaring through the sky and plopping down in the middle of the Alamo's zocalo. And to see the effects of grapeshot or cannister on massed troops. In most movies set around this time or a bit later, in the Civil War, we never get to see a cannonball hit the ground. There is simply an explosion and a few stunt men are tossed into the air. Grapeshot is never shown and I don't know why, because in close quarters it was murderous, far more devastating to attacking troops than musket fire. Grapeshot turns a cannon into a huge shotgun full of bullet-sized balls. Cannister shot takes the shell into the midst of the enemy before it explodes and sprays its little iron balls about. It was responsible for most of the deaths among the men of Pickett's charge. At any rate, technology is given its due.<br/><br/>The movie ends after the battle of San Jacinto. I'm not familiar with Texas' history but I know something about movie scripts and this battle seems to be in the movie mainly because we won it. It's the equivalent of Doolittle's raid on Tokyo at the end of the unfortunate ""Pearl Harbor."" What I mean is that it provides a victorious ending, with Sam Houston astride a rearing white charger and waving his sabre. This story really ended with the defeat at the Alamo.<br/><br/>I can't help wondering what this story would be like if the movie had been made by Mexico. How hard would it be to paint Texas as a secessionist province of the national territory, not unlike the Confederate South, except that Texas was being supported and populated by a foreign power? <br/><br/>A nice symbolic touch. The Alamo is surrounded by Mexican soldiers who persistently play the Deguello, a song meaning ""no mercy."" It is sunset and Davy Crockett says, ""I know what's missing,"" and he takes out his violin, goes to the roof, and using the Mexican band as an accompanying orchestra he smoothly begins to improvise a tune which ends in a sprightly jig. A nocturne in which one lonely fiddle defies a marching band, a cavalry march turned into a violin concerto. <br/><br/>It's a better movie than I'd expected it to be. I'd recommend watching it. You'll get involved, even if you're already familiar with the events themselves."

It was a desperate struggle during the early morning hours. One of my favorite parts in the movie is Crockett's last stand. The scene shows him and a few other Texans that have retreated into the church. They know there is no way they can survive. Looks of sadness are on their faces when they realize they are about to die. Suddenly, Mexicans charge through the church's entrance. Crockett and his men literally run to meet them with swinging muskets. It also shows Crockett surrendering and being executed by Santa Anna's men. Before he dies, he warns them that he's a ""screamer."" Right before the Mexicans bayonet him, he screams at them before being run through with their bayonets.

The actors put in decent performances: Dennis Quaid as Gen. Sam Houston, Jason Patric as Jim Bowie, and Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett. In this movie, Crockett is seen as both man and myth, mostly the man aware of his myth. The best scene has Crockett answering the Mexican army band's fight song with his own fiddle playing.

","I felt about The Alamo the same way I did about The Perfect Storm, where a bunch of fools deliberately tackle a storm and get killed. Then the fools get a movie praising their bravery. Apparently, the battle at The Alamo was pointless, driven by pride. They should have fled.<br/><br/>But maybe not. I found the film difficult to follow, unlike the sensational historical dramas, Thirteen Days and Braveheart. What were they fighting for? Was Texas an independent country before, after? Was something at stake? Why would they leave Texas undefended? Why would the only major fort in the area be a poorly built one? I went into the film wondering why The Alamo was important to history, and I left the same way. My best guess is that it underscored the cruelty of the Mexican army. Thus the battle cry, ""Remember the Alamo"", i.e. remember the cruelty.<br/><br/>I always feel a film that's true to life is worth watching, even if it's not so good (Pearl Harbor), but something about the acting or storyline seemed unrealistic and lacked drama to me. Maybe it's Dennis Quaid; I always seem to dislike his films.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- History buffs, but don't expect high drama<br/><br/>-- Texans & Mexicans<br/><br/>-- Pioneers with a coonskin cap who can kill a bear bare-handed<br/><br/>I'll give this film a 6 out of 10, but hey, I'm a Yankee, what the hell do I know (wink)."

","I am a Texan; therefore, since I was six, the tales of the Alamo have been imposed in my mind. I know the tales of Sam Houston, Davy Crockett, James Bowie, and William Travis by heart. Since my father is a history buff, it was only natural that we drive to San Antonio and visit the majestic Alamo. Never before has a movie truly captured the spirit and essence of this terrible tragedy. `The Alamo' is an extremely accurate movie from the characters down to the set designs. However, one thing the movie failed to mention was how Travis was not the `dead beat dad' who walked out on his family. It was his wife who had the affair and decided to leave him. Travis took his son with him because he was truly his child. The daughter however, was only a baby at that time and the child of the other man his wife had entertained.  Hum.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a great movie that captures the soul of Texas. It is accurate to the extreme and in my opinion there is no dull moment. It is as if the scenes build on each other, with every minute that passes the mood becomes more intense.  There are touching moments when we the audience can connect with the character on screen, we can feel the fear of the men as they fight the battle they know they can never win.<br/><br/>The actors are phenomenal, especially Billy Bob Thornton, he portrayed Crockett as the man, not the myth. The music is wonderful, it is a blend of salsa and strings, a masterpiece in my opinion. Carter Burwell did a wonderful job composing this score; it is right up there with Howard Shore's `The Lord of the Rings' compositions.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a wonderful movie that should not be forgotten, but remembered."

He basically carries the movie, since the other characters are pretty uninteresting. Jim Bowie's existential battle with a life of sin and final bout with consumption is more suggested (for those who know the story) than well-execute. So it worked for me. The battle scene could have been longer, and there were four or five laugh-out-loud bad parts, but I don't think there's anyway I couldn't have liked a movie with this title.

Travis's moving speech you never get a sense of what these Texans are fighting for. No one really understands the significance of The Alamo itself. If the movie spent some time explaining the significance of the Alamo and not on characters the movie would have been better.

I think that I enjoyed it much more the second time around. The movie was historically accurate and I was surprised at the detail that was put into it. I also thought the actors, for the most part, were really good and portrayed the historical figures well. I wish there was more character development in the movie because if you're not familiar with the historical figures, you don't really know much about the main character in the film.

Quaid was powerful as Sam Houston, Thornton was likable in a tender characterization of David (Davey)Crockett and Jason Patric's Jim Bowie was hard as his steel knife. Patrick Wilson did his best as Colonel Travis -I don't know how old the real Colonel Travis was in 1836 or what his personality was like- but the role would've been better suited to an older actor.<br/><br/>The Alamo's long, detail and character-driven prelude was a risky decision by the director, but pays off with repeat viewings of the film.

One of the minor controversies that continues to bother me about these films is the use of the name ""Davy"" as a nickname for Mr. Crockett.<br/><br/>The name Davy got its start in the stage shows that idealized the life of Tennessee's Congressional Representative while allowing a hefty dose of entertainment. In the 1960's, Walt Disney Productions took the name, and engraved it upon the American psyche to such a degree that film makers hesitate to simply discard a name that does not appear to have been Crockett's choice. If you read his autobiography, you will not see it mentioned. Not once. Crockett's book is a wonderful work by a masterful politician, and admitted humanitarian. It is well worth reading.<br/><br/>That being said, I will recommend this film for what it is, .... a much better attempt at telling a part of American history with less legend and more fact.

","The Mexican actor who played Santa Anna was NOT the first Mexican to play Santa Anna in movie history. It was James Olmos way back in 1980, a Mexican, who played Santa Anna for a PBS movie called, Juan Seguin. This man has been in a lot of movies as an extra and star, most people know him in his long career in front of the camera. And the REAL Santa Anna was not that bad as portrayed in the movie, a lot of his alleged Don Juan activities are just myths, that's all. Anyway, the movie itself I would rate a C~ no more, no less, it was just an average western like John Wayne's version. It tried to portrayed the three main characters in a new light based on their bad character traits as revealed by historical research. HOWEVER, it was good and wholesome to see Davy Crockett on his knees in front of the Mexican soldiery, for he did indeed surrender to Mexican forces that day, only to be killed moments after surrendering. This has been known just days after the battle. Even Sam Houston said that Davy and a handful of other Tex defenders begged for mercy from the Mexican soldiers. The rest is history as they say!"

","I'm not sure about historical accuracy, having never studied a detailed history of what happened at the Alamo. But I must say, this is a stirring re-enactment, with excellent acting and special effects.<br/><br/>Here's a refresher course for those of you who don't remember the circumstances of the Alamo. As a newly-freed Texas was trying to determine the form of government they would accept, Lt. Col. Travis and Jim Bowie were sent to command a garrison at an old Spanish mission called the Alamo. When the commander of the post left, command was left to Travis; the commander did not expect an attack. However, Santa Ana was marching through the winter. Davy Crockett arrived in the mission, and shortly afterward, Santa Ana showed up. The result was a siege that ended in the death of nearly all those at the Alamo.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thornton does a rousing job as Davy Crockett, and Dennis Quaid's performance of Gen. Sam Houston is just as stirring. Even the actors playing minor characters such as Juan Seguin (Jordi Molla) shine in this film. Of course, in a movie like this, it's nearly impossible to keep track of every character and actor, but what you can recognize is always superb. And this film does a good job of keeping this film on the main characters.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to just about anyone who enjoys history and/or war movies."

","One more movie about the Alamo martyrs. A solid, traditional, Hollywood war movie, with all of the usual attributes like heroic monologues backgrounded by an orchestra brass section on the soundtrack that's crawling closer with every fatalistic word, a good good guy and a bad good guy that reveals his ""goodness"" as the movie unfolds, slow motion dramatic moments, lots of dust and lots of uniformed people running at the camera. In general - as always - a group recall of personal life stories against the battle background. I guess there's no other way of telling a war story in cinema.<br/><br/>The subdivision ""good guys / bad guys"" is, well, startling: the good guys are mostly heroes and men of honor, while the bad guys are generally miserable, disgusting and look like walking displays of mortal sins. It makes the rare moments when the bad guys are beaten rather satisfying, but it also (IMHO) decreases the realism a good deal: in real life the bad guys are far less repelling, you even never know whether you end up as one of them (or maybe you already have?). I guess it's about dramatizing the story or something like that. There's surely a name for it, I just don't know it yet.<br/><br/>Speaking of realism: despite the really big scale of the battle (won't say ""huge"" cause even the ""Brave Heart"" is huger than this), there's practically no blood in the movie, so I figure that the complete realism wasn't the point, or at least wasn't the emphasis of the story.<br/><br/>In any case, all war movies are similar (see above), so what really makes the difference are the details. And the special mention goes to Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett! Billy Bob is amazing here, I don't care much about what he says or what he does (that's all in the script) but it's all about how he says or does it. He manages to create an absolutely lovable character, and fairly believable as well. Excellent work. The young Patrick Wilson is also pretty good as William Travis, for some reason he reminds me of a young Kevin Costner.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing to mention is the specially rigged camera that makes quite a few curious shots. But the potentially impressive shot with the cannonball flying over the fort's wall is just too slow for my taste, they could've made it more dynamic. Anyway, in the LOTR-3 a similar shot was done much, much better.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is slow at the beginning, probably too slow, and aggravated by this terrible piano that appears here and there in the soundtrack and makes the whole thing not only slow but moody and boring (this is subjective, of course). However, after about 30 minutes of making you want to kill the pianist, the movie starts uphill and gets interesting.<br/><br/>To summarize: it's a war movie with the standard set of corresponding character types and scenes, with a good deal of touching, romantic moments (the word ""romantic"" doesn't necessarily mean ""related to a romance""), and is a good thing to watch, once you've made it past the first 30 or so minutes of it. Strong playacting and some interesting shots make it even more appealing. I'd give it solid 7 out of 10, basically, for the playacting."

The actors give an outstanding performance and bring a sense of the ""human"" side to the heroes that everyone in Texas believes to be larger than life. Unfortunately, even the movie in its attempt to be ""accurate"" left a few things to be entertainment only and not history based. For example, just where was the actual church location in regards to the rest of the mission? Not that close to the main courtyard. How many people were captured at the end of the battle? Most reports say seven, even this movie's director claimed to use that report, but why was there only one shown? Entertainment. Several other things will stand out to ""Alamo Buffs"" as odd, but the fact is this is just one person's view of the battle. There are very few reports that can be considered true and accurate. The people inside the fort were scared to death, the survivors saw or knew their husbands were dead. They were likely in shock. The men taking the Alamo had seen their friends killed as they fought side-by-side. The attack itself took place in the dark so who knows what happened on either side? The entire case for the Alamo plays out like a courtroom drama. Any given lawyer could argue for or against just about any aspect of the Alamo. It was recently actually mentioned that the Alamo defenders may have stayed to protect gold and silver that Bowie brought in to help fund the Texas rebellion. Again, historians will become lawyers and argue that for sometime too. My final vote is The Alamo is good. It is as good as Wayne's Alamo was for 1960 (and at least attempting to be more accurate). I've added to my collection and found that in no way did any of the Alamo defenders ever appear to be cowards. They were ordinary men who were asked to face the impossible. Some of them were just built up larger than life even during their lifetimes."

The movie is telling a true story of a fight for independence, and in my opinion it does it well.<br/><br/>The movie could have very easily become one of two things. It could have taken the road of a movie like Gladiator and chosen action over story, or it could have gone down the path of Gods and Generals and chosen story and character study over action. I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with either style, except that it wouldn't have worked for this movie. Instead, the movie finds a perfect balance between the two. It gives you enough action to be entertained, while giving enough story and character building to make you actually care what happens.<br/><br/>The performances were spectacular. Billy Bob Thornton, who I normally don't like, plays Davy Crockett with a huge amount of charisma and class. Instead of playing him as the bear wrestling king of the wild frontier, he plays him as the Congressman caught in a fight that he didn't plan on being in.<br/><br/>
Dennis Quaid plays Sam Houston with the most power he's displayed since Great Balls of Fire. His performance as the slightly egotistical, alcoholic General is near Oscar worthy in my opinion and deserves to be recognized as such.<br/><br/>Jason Patric gives my favorite and best performance in the movie. He plays by far the most complex character and never goes over the top with it. Every moment he was on screen my attention was completely on him. He was able to stand next to Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton and steal the show away from them. Overall, Jason Patric gives the best performance of this year so far, and I believe it will probably hold up as one of the best by the end of the year.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, The Alamo did not dissapoint. It knew what it wanted to be and it did it well. The Alamo masters it's style and is the best it can be for the type of movie it is."

This is not usually the kind of movie I like to go see (I'm more of a comedy person) and to be honest, I didn't expect much out of it.  I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the characterization, dialogue, cinamatography and acting were amazing.  The main characters of Bowie, Travis, Houston and Crockett came to life.  As a Texan, I understood better and appreciated the sacrifices these men made for the future Texans.  I took Texas history in 7th grade and have visited the Alamo but this movie enhanced my knowledge of the events and gave me a picture of how truly scary the situation was for those men defending the Alamo.

This a very accurate and factual version that has a different kind of heroism than most Alamo films. The herosim of real men who made a choice to fight and die. The film does drag a little with alot of uneventful scenes leading up to the battle but the ending battles make up for the lacking of action throughout the film. A very different Davy Crockett portrayal by Billy Bob Thorton may disappoint some who are used to the John Wayne type of heoric legendary Crockett, but all in all this Crockett has his own heroism as a regular man who chooses to fight to his death. Very good portrayals of Bowie, Travis and Houston. Quite possibly the best historical presentation of The Alamo and very entertaining as well!"

Billy Bob Thorton gives an outstanding performance as the legendary hero Davey Crockett, who according to this film is more myth than reality. Personally I would rather see John Wayne's outstanding version of the battle for the Alamo.

History, after all, is written by the winners. I think the last scene with Davy Crockett is based on a book by a Mexican soldier, but I am not 100% sure. I like the line Crockett gives about the burden of being Davy Crockett, the legendary Crockett, that is, rather than the private Crockett he is not allowed to be. It is just as well that it turned out to be such a rallying cry for houston's Army, because it doesn't feel like it accomplished much else.

Instead of Davy Crockett being executed, I would have liked to see him die fighting like some accounts say. This movie is well made and entertaining. Near the end of the movie I thought it would end with Santa Anna winning and never getting his comeuppance, so I enjoyed the victory of the Texans at the end of the movie.

"jackfull","8","1","1","9 October 2018"," For Texas
","Now I have not seen the 1960 version of this film with John Wayne, so I will not try to compare them or tell you which one is better. This film is entertaining as it is. 
If you are bored and you scrolling through Netflix, and happen to stumble upon this film, sure you can watch it. But if your not a historian or a hard core american, you might not enjoy it all to well. But that being said, this film isn't all bad. 
John Lee Hancock's The Alamo is a loud mix of tender, tense, and battle torn scenes. You have a sense of understanding and connection with the characters. This is one of the films good qualities. Something this film doesn't accomplish well or even focus a lot on is picking out a main character. Depending on what part of the film your in, the focus can shift between Sam Houston to Davy Crockett to William Travis and then back to Houston. This can make it a tiny bit difficult to know who your supposed to be paying attention. Also there is a random young man in the Mexican army who they focus a good chunk of time on. Your never told his name, what he says, or even his role. Its not up until the very end when his role in the story comes. In the final battle among the confusion, he pulls his trigger, hitting the American general. After that scene, we never see this boy again. 
Overall however, even with the low points, this movie more than makes up for it in visuals, dialogue, and overall flow. There are points where you can't help but laugh and times when you just have to sit there in silence. The visuals are great and very accurate, from the clothing to the battles, to the overall style of the film. 
If you like being an American, or just want a good old battle, then this is definitely for you."
"neil-476","8","1","1","31 January 2016"," Nicely detailed
","A small number of Texans defend the Alamo against invading Mexicans, buying time for Sam Houston's army.<br/><br/>This retelling of the Alamo makes efforts to be historically accurate (John Wayne's 1960 version, by contrast, was more interested in the myth). It is dark and dirty, and the three key characters among the defenders - Travis, Bowie and Crocket - are far more conflicted and flawed than their earlier equivalents. And in many ways that is a good thing, because the nobility they display in their doomed defence is all the more striking by virtue of its contrast.<br/><br/>It's also worth saying that the action sequences are well staged, and the performances are all very good. The negative reviews on IMDb aren't wholly deserved."

The main characters were okay, with Jason Patric excellent as Jim Bowie, but the actor playing Sant Anna, I felt was miscast, and not the dynamic commander you expected. Though meant as entertainment, the Alamo compound itself jarred my eye being wrongly laid out, but only because I know some of the history, which does work against you in such a film. If only they had it a bit more like the Alamo compound used in John Wayne's epic. I felt after the battle ended at the Alamo the film should have ended, instead of trying to follow on to San Jacinto, as it was it these scenes, the lack of numbers in extras than those who were actually there was very evident. One man equal to ten or even twenty men may work in wargaming, but not in a film. As for the demise of Crockett as shown, wasn't really needed. Anyway, I prefer this version to that made in 1960."

"gcrokus","Null","1","1","25 June 2004"," Pitched Battle
","The myth, sense of adventure and inherent good vs. evil battle we know today as `The Alamo' has always demanded better treatment by Hollywood. And this film comes as close to depicting the way the siege probably played out far more fairly than we have seen.  In that sense this revisit to `The Alamo' is a very welcome addition to the list of movies on the subject.<br/><br/>
	The casting alone demands some attention.  Billy Bob Thornton gives a nice portrayal of the figure we now think Davy Crockett probably was; a man thrust into a pretty sticky situation but due to his own responsibility as a leader plays it out as best he can.  Bowie (Jason Patric) adds an element of pathos far superior to any ever portrayed, while Travis (Patrick Wilson) and Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) are far more human  and in Houston's case more brilliant  than we might have considered.<br/><br/>	For some reason battle films require sentimental touches, and this version of `The Alamo' is no exception.  Nonetheless there would have to be, in a siege of eight days, some time for reflection by participants on both sides. And to the credit of the writers enough humor is injected into the script to balance somewhat this aspect  how to film men waiting - of the 1836 engagement.<br/><br/>	 Essentially critically dismissed or ignored, `The Alamo' will prove to be one of the very good but highly underrated movies of the year.  `The Alamo' delivers in a few minutes a more remarkable feel for what the actual few minutes of pitched battle probably looked and sounded like than we have ever seen.  There is a shot from afar, in the early morning light, which dramatically captures the moment the assailants took the mission.  And the sensory quality of that few minutes of hellish pandemonium is equal to any seen in a war film, contemporary or not.<br/><br/>        As one does when entering this shrine in San Antonio, our hat is off to the fine effort put forth here.  Humanizing what was most assuredly an inhumane series of events - the fight for a free Texas - has never been done so well.<br/><br/>Rating: Three Stars"

It seems interesting that even back then they were implementing early forms of psychological warfare to wear the troops down mentally.

"dunric","Null","1","1","12 April 2004"," Remember the Alamo
","Having studied Alamo history for many years, I was aware of the complexities involved in recounting an accurate story of the key events in the Texas Revolution.<br/><br/>I will qualify my initial impressions with the following statement: This movie is not for everyone. If you don't enjoy history and yawn at military exploits, then the Alamo is not for you.<br/><br/>But if you, like me, enjoy reading about the exploits of one Davy Crockett from Tennessee, or James Bowie and his famous Bowie Knife, then this movie will bring to life what you might have already read in various text books, biographies and documentaries on television.<br/><br/>The cast chosen for this movie was curious, to say the least: Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett? Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston? Jason Patric as James Bowie? Patrick Wilson as William Travis? I was as skeptical as everyone else!<br/><br/>But everyone does a fantastic job, in particular Thornton. He gives a very convincing performance of the famous man who is unsure of his legacy as the ""bear hunter"" and ""back woodsman"" portrayed in legend. The finest example of this occurs during the scene where Davy is recounting a story of the Creek Indian Wars decades earlier. His story and the barbarism he recounts is one of cinematic legend, and will not be soon forgotten, nor will his riveting violin playing atop the Alamo (in countering the Mexican ""Slit the Throat"" drum beat).<br/><br/>James Bowie is expertly portrayed by Patric as the historical drunkard with a chronic, deadly lung disease. But we also see the human side of Bowie, including his former memories of a love affair and his often strained relationship with his slave.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson's performance is also exceptional, a rare gem of a performance for such a young actor with so little resume. Although he, at times, appears somewhat dazed and confused, this could be because as he transforms into the confident leader of legend, he is recounting his mistakes as a serial adulterer and dead beat dad.<br/><br/>Quaid also delivers an outstanding presence, casting new light into the real Houston's brass nature, covetous of both land and the bottle. But he rekindles the passions of his history by stirring the emotions of his rag tag army with the now infamous ""Remember the Alamo!"" call to his troops.<br/><br/>Jordi Molla, as Juan Seguin, shows the conflicting nature by which many Tejano's lived, fought and often died. Although Seguin participates in the first parts of the Alamo siege, he is sent on errand by Travis to deliver a message to Sam Houston, who promptly insists he stays instead of returning to the Alamo. This, no doubt, shows the importance of the Tejanos to the Texian cause. In future years, Seguin also participates in the Mexican-American War (on the Mexican Side), and also becomes mayor of San Antonio.<br/><br/>The Alamo movie is long (over two hours) and drawn out. There is much history to flesh out, and character development takes a good portion of the movie. Much of it is humanizing and de-mystifying the mythology of the core group of defenders who fought and died at the Alamo. But another portion -- and the best, in my opinion -- is the balancing of Mexican sympathies of several generals with the cruel, ""take no prisoners"" aim of the vilified despot, Santa Anna. It was obvious to all 187 defenders that Santa Anna intended to take no prisoners, even if they surrendered.<br/><br/>Once the final siege begins, we are treated to a very vivid, well-executed battle that point by point hits the perverbial nail on the historical head (with one key exception, which I will mention shortly). The siege is relatively short, true to history and expertly done. Many of the cinematic scenes are truly stunning, giving the audience a good indication of the hopelessness the defenders faced on the final morning of the siege. But it also shows the heavy price Santa Anna was willing to place on his soldiers, referring to them as ""chickens"". Historically, the Mexicans lost upwards of 1600 men of the original 4,000+ force (Santa Anna committed only one reserve, and possibly two, to the battle).<br/><br/>The siege, however, ends with an historical inaccuracy. Crockett is shown to have survived the siege, along with five or six defenders, and brought before Santa Anna. The movie is basing this on the forged journals of a surviving non-combatant. He was said to have ""lunged"" at Santa Anna and nearly got him, just before bayonets killed him. This is also in contrast to the real history of Crockett going down fighting with the rest of the defenders -- down to the last man (indeed, at least two non-combatants correctly identified Crockett's body near the church). In truth, the defenders did fight to the last man, often using their weapons as clubs when ammunition ran low, but Santa Anna enforced a ""take no prisoners"" aim (by the December 30, 1835 decree of treating all foreigners who took up arms as pirates), so perhaps Crockett died as he was portrayed in history.             <br/><br/>The movie does not end with Crockett's death, however. It goes on to show the Battle of San Jacinto, in which Juan Seguin is shocked to see the blood-thirsty nature of the Texian soldiers. The battle lasts a stunning 18 minutes, in which Santa Anna's army is routed, he is captured in the field and brought before Houston -- who spares his life (if only to get Texas).<br/><br/>The Alamo is a good movie. In fairness, though, parts of the Alamo could have been better. Very little mention is made of Goliad, it is only hinted at. And the other massacres which occurred during that time are given very little screen time. We are only shown Santa Anna's cruelty in executing 28 or so survivors from a previous battle. We are not shown what significance these massacres had in arousing sympathy across the United States."

","I was disappointed with The Alamo because I thought it could have been better.  There were scenes which were enjoyable.  Billy Bob's character, Davy Crockett, is one of the only highlights acting-wise in this one.  In my opinion, he comes close to stealing the show.  Although it isn't really that difficult in this film.  Something about it just didn't work for me.  It's tough to put a finger on exactly what it was.  Possibly just that the slow beginning didn't draw me in as it should have.  Possibly the ending.  Who knows. It was nice to see from a historical perspective, as some youth these days may not know much about the real story behind Texas as a state.  As a film though, it fell a little short for me."

While waiting for reinforcements from General Sam Houston(Dennis Quaid)the fighters for Texan independence are slaughtered. <br/><br/>This telling of the saga leaves a few questions to be asked; but over all this is a very interesting movie. Maybe a half hour too long, but still there is enough to keep your interest. Thornton is really the star of the movie and I liked how he put some humor into the already colorful character David Crockett. One of the biggest questions I have is: how did Crockett REALLY die? Patric as Bowie was violent yet passionate; Quaid has Houston coming across pretty pompous; and Echevarria may or may not have been dead on with Santa Anna as an overly self-centered warmonger with an ego the size of Mexico.<br/><br/>The intense battle scenes seem to be missing the usual obligatory blood and gore. And the minute profanity seemed unrealistic for the nature of the event. But then this is a Disney product and arguably the most accurate version of The Alamo...and you keep looking for John Wayne."

Test audiences did not like the movie.

Now the movie is finally out and we can see for ourselves what the hooplah was all about. It doesn't take long to realize that if this is the best they can do after 2+ years of editing, this movie should have been scrapped completely. It is a painfully boring movie, with not one saving performance. The final battle scene is generic, almost recycled. We have seen this in hundreds of movies before. There is nothing new, there is no reason to care for the characters, despite the hour and half of character development before any action actually starts. And the movie studio should be sued for false advertising. Dennis Quaid is being billed as one of the main actors in this film, but he appears only briefly at the beginning and again at the end. He is barely in the film at all. It is a boring movie, not even worth a rent after it leaves theaters in a week.

","When will a movie about what The Alamo was really all about be made? It is now the twenty-first century and yet here we have, once again, a movie that essentially celebrates a republic -- Texas -- founded on slavery. Mexico abolished slavery in 1829, an important fact totally omitted from this film. White Texans were rebelling against their government in Mexico in no small part because they wanted to preserve slavery. They were, in effect, terrorists fighting against their own government in Mexico City that wanted slavery abolished. The Texan victory over Mexico in 1836 assured that slavery would continue. If Mexico had prevailed at the Battle of San Jacinto, which followed the Texan defeat at The Alamo, slavery would have ended in Texas in 1836 instead of thirty years later. The movie adds at the end that Texas was admitted as the 28th state into the Union in 1845, but omits that it was admitted as a slave state. Is that fact unimportant or irrelevant? So here we have once again a film that distorts history and overturns elemental morality by arguing that those who were, in effect, fighting for slavery were really fighting for freedom. And by the way, it was not only Jim Bowie who owned slaves, as the movie briefly acknowledges, but also Sam Houston and Davy Crockett as well. How heroic is that? I guess we will have to wait for an African American writer and director to finally get this story right."

","As an historical buff, born in San Antonio, read 16 books on the Alamo type of buff, I'd say that I'd give the movie just 3. No, there was not enough character development, (oh by the way, also an actor, writer, director as well so I do know about character development). As far as telling details about the characters, 'learned more about Travis'? Not much. When a character had to reveal any hint about themselves it came almost as a one-liner, e.g., Travis to Bowie, ""I gamble, go to whores and leave my wife, but I never drink..."" Second Example: Primarily because people probably wondered what the woman with Bowie was referring to. Bowie married the young daughter of a landowner in San Antonio. She supposedly was the sister of Bowie's wife who died. Scandal was that he was technically never unmarried from his former wife. And finally, a glint at Crockett's true self when he asked, 'the fightin's over, isn't it?' Crockett was a man of 50, down on his luck and recently voted out of congress, he didn't go to Texas to fight, he went to reclaim his position in politics, his position as a legend. He inadvertently helped his own legend by dying at the Alamo - talk about irony. In fact, most Texians were in Texas because they were just one step ahead of collectors, barristers and angry wives. So, granted, in the length of this movie there is just not enough time than to give the more than the dime store thumbnail sketch of the characters. I will say that compared to the Wayne fiasco this was miles ahead, light years in fact. Yes, there are quite a few facts that they got right; the questionable 'line in the dirt' was left out and Crockett surviving only to be executed. Travis' death came a little late, he was one of the first to die but then, I can get real picky when it comes to three things I know well, History, Texas (and the Alamo) and acting. One never forgets the impact of the first time that one steps into the Alamo and the feeling of the very 'heavy' air inside. And yes, Tejanos were very prominent in the development of Texas both as a Republic and then later as a state. And lastly, the Alamo defenders were not 'americans'. One brief example, if anyone heard, was the declaration in one of the debates that the 'citizens' of Texas were in violation of the constitution of 1824 that they agreed to by not only giving up their American citizenship but by becoming Mexcian nationals and swearing Alleghenies to Mexico.

The character of Sam Houston, impeccably performed by great Dennis Quaide, is another big winner. Dennis performs so deeply and so well that I never doubted his integrity and his sincerity. Another great winner is Mr. Echevarria as Santa Anna - excellent portrayal of a malicious dictator, cowardly and treacherous. His subordinates awoke more sympathy, given the valiant deaths of some, but Santa Anna shies too as a great example of a real evil guy.

","As a native Texan, I learned the story of the Alamo early on and it became, as I think it does for most Texans, part of my psyche. The subject carries a lot of emotional investment, so it should come as no surprise that I want any movie made about it to be a good one. And so it was with 2004's 'The Alamo.' My hopes were high, despite reading about a troubled production, that this time they would get it right. The 1960 John Wayne epic had its heart in the right place (too much so, really) and succeeded admirably at times, but too often Wayne indulged himself in dumb comic relief and unreservedly hackneyed sentiment. That movie cried out for a better director. In terms of historical accuracy, this latest version of the famous battle comes out ahead, but in terms of cinema, it does not. It thankfully never reaches the depths of silliness Wayne's version did, but neither does it reach the heights of glory and drama that earlier film achieved, particularly in the climactic battle scene. The battle scenes here are often eerily quiet and lack the intensity of that earlier film. Of the four central characters (Travis, Bowie, Crockett, and Houston), Jason Patric does best as Bowie, in a very different portrayal than Richard Widmark's. Here Bowie is almost the epitome of 'cool,' a far cry from Widmark's impulsive hothead, despite succumbing over the course of the story to 'consumption' (tuberculosis). Billy Bob Thornton provides an interesting 'alternative' reading of Davy Crockett as well, more showman than hero... a better storyteller than soldier. His fame precedes him and also entraps him; he confides to Bowie at one point that if everyone wasn't watching him, he might just jump over the Alamo walls and make a break for it. Dennis Quaid is Sam Houston, who figures more prominently in this 'Alamo' than the previous one. Quaid seems to struggle at times to get his head around the complicated Houston, a fearless yet reckless leader of men who struggles with his own weaknesses and is often his own worst enemy. It is an adequate performance. Where 'The Alamo' really fails is in young Patrick Wilson's wholly inadequate portrayal of William Travis. There are several reasons Travis is the most important character in this story, but I think the main one is that, of the four men, he is the one who is known for only one thing- commanding the Alamo. Crockett, Bowie, and Houston are all famous for other endeavors, pursuits, and achievements. Travis alone is inextricably linked to this famous battle. You simply cannot tell the story of the Alamo well without telling the story of Travis well, and this 'Alamo' doesn't. The script is part of the problem but it's more than that. Instead of the gallant, swashbuckling hero Laurence Harvey portrayed, Travis seems more of a bookworm, annoying more than inspiring. Say what you will about Harvey's over-the-top, flamboyantly-costumed leader, but he made the character a mythic figure and was without a doubt the best thing about the 1960 film. Wilson's Travis by comparison seems more like a nervous high-school kid. In the earlier version, Travis got on everyone's nerves because he was a strict disciplinarian, a stickler for military detail; in the 2004 film, he gets on everyone's nerves because he's, well, a nerd. Probably neither portrayal is particularly accurate; however, one can definitely see Laurence Harvey's character writing that he will ""never retreat or surrender,"" as the real Travis did. So it is this flaw more than anything that ultimately sinks the latest 'Alamo.' Here and there are some good scenes and intelligent retellings of the people and places surrounding the famous siege. The Mexican leader, Santa Anna, is entertainingly interpreted as sort of a Mexican mafia chieftain. There is a memorable scene where Thornton's Crockett recounts a battle with Indians that ends in a somewhat stomach-churning manner. And there is the slightly curious ending, which portrays the Battle of San Jacinto, where the Texans under Sam Houston actually defeated Santa Anna and his army and won their independence. The makers of 'The Alamo,' 2004 edition, had their hearts in the right place just as John Wayne did, but for all their good intentions missed the mark, just as he had."

","""No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for HIS country.""<br/><br/>Gen George S. Patton<br/><br/>I settled down with the spouse to watch the DVD of the Alamo last Saturday night. Having no particular affinity for Texas, and being somewhat embarrassed by the US history of chauvinistic expansionism, the main reason we wished to see the movie was to check out the props and costumes. In the first scene the camera pans over the carnage left by the Mexican army and there, in extreme close-up, lay a broken pair of spectacles. ""Riding temple"" glasses from the 1880's! ""ANACHRONISM"", I thought. Spouse and I have been living history reenactors for ten years. Our era is the 1820's to 1830's so we pretty much know what the details of the era should look like. Of course, even the ""professionals"" at Williamsburg, Virginia, lapse sometimes when it comes to glasses, shoes and pocket watches, so we can cut some slack for a Hollywood movie. As for the movie? How did we know that it would be such a moving experience and become such a topic of conversation at the dinner table?<br/><br/>This is a great story of people caught up in circumstances beyond their control who decide to follow their individual concepts of ""honor"" and ""right"" to the end. I won't go into great detail explaining the plot as do so many of the reviewers on this site. Besides, this being a true life story, there is no plot. Character is everything. Travis, the peacock, who comes to understand that leadership is more than rank and fancy uniforms. Bowie, the ex-slave trader/duelist, who is running from (or to) his past. And then there's Crockett. Billy Bob Thornton steals the show as Congressman Crockett. Every scene that he appears in belongs to him. Lock, stock and barrel. Is there a 21st century equivalent to David Crockett? Someone who, in his lifetime, saw stage plays and ""penny dreadful"" booklets about his exploits produced? Did he begin to believe his own hype, or was he striving to live up to it? Thornton does a great job in his characterization.<br/><br/>This movie was probably a dud in the theaters because few people learn history anymore. The story can be slow and confusing to someone unacquainted with the facts. If you think that the Alamo is just an old mission church in downtown San Antonio, do a little reading on Texas history before viewing. For those reviewers who felt that the Santa Ana character was a stereotype, do some research. He wasn't a stereotype, he was the PROTOTYPE. Almost every military dictator in Latin America since his time has followed in the footsteps of Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana.<br/><br/>For the reviewer from Texas that denied that Crockett survived the siege and was executed later: Some evidence has surfaced in the last ten years (in the form of letters of Mexican army officers) that Crockett and a few Tennesseeans did survive. One letter had Crockett begging and crying for mercy. I liked the movie's take on this rumor. Now, about the props: After getting past the 1880's spectacles, everything was close to perfect. Travis' lap desk, the lanterns, the cooking fires, Crockett's fiddle, the clothes. A British Army officer named Basil Hall toured the US in 1827 and published a book with illustrations, one of which shows a backwoods hunter in Georgia decked out in tail coat and top hat with his shooting pouch and powder horn slung on his shoulder and leaning on a long rifle. Just like in this movie. There could have been a few percussion cap rifles scattered among all the flintlocks since they had been around for over ten years prior. Travis' double barrel fowler was a nice touch. Complaints about props?: A black-powder shooter can tell that they were shooting blanks. No safe charge that is stuffed down the muzzle of a flintlock sounds the same as a tightly patched lead ball. Also, as in so many ""period"" movies, there was WAY too much light in the interior scenes. To get the feel of period atmosphere, nothing matches the formal dinner scene from the 1997 version of PERSUASION."

","But unfortunately, the story gets muddled down by trying to stay too close to history.<br/><br/>Ignoring the juvenile critique that was given by the first reviewer, I'd say this is a decent, if not good movie. The biggest problem that was apparent is during the second act, there is a quite a lull in the plot.<br/><br/>The acting was good, great at times. The story itself is fantastic, but as I said before, it appears that Hancock attempted to not dramatize certain events, and had alot of empty space to fill. There were definite moments that did salvage the situation somewhat, and the fight scenes were fairly spectacular.<br/><br/>I'd say it's worth a matinee, or a rental. 31/2 out of 5."
"tinkicker","Null","2","4","13 April 2004"," Far better than I expected
","All of the pre-release buzz led me to believe that the movie would present the revisitonist version of the story.  I was extremely pleased that it didn't.  Since I grew up in north-central Texas in the 1950's and '60's, the John Wayne version is what I held as truth for a long time.  Since then, having done quite a bit of reading on the battle, and on the War for Texas Independance, it became clear that, while Wayne's movie really got my blood going, it was not very accurate.  Hancock's movie tells the story, not only more accurately, but is just as rousing.  I came away with a new appreciation of sacrifice and true courage, and just how much we owe the past.  Contrary to what many have said, this wasn't a fight for white supremancy or the US trying to take more land.  It was a fight between free-thinking people (from many different lands, including Mexico) and a centralist dictator with delusions of grandure who turned on many of the people who originally supported him (including Stephen F. Austin).  The Alamo gave the fledgling government of Texas TIME to declare independance and begin to organize an army.  The defenders knew toward the end that they were going to die...but they also had to know it was for a cause.  The one problem I saw with the movie was that it could be difficult to understand why some of the things happened the way they did without prior knowledge. Overall, it was an excellent movie and should not be devisive if people are willing to look beyond their own prejudices. Remember the Alamo!"
"jsh06","5","2","4","11 April 2004"," A good version of a great story
","As a Texan, The Alamo is part of my heritage. We have heard the story from an early age and I also had the benefit of seeing the John Wayne version as an elementary school kid. This is not the Wayne version but it is a somewhat more realistic version. There is always some difficulty in making a movie which is historical in nature. It has to be entertaining while keeping to the facts. I think they were able to do both.<br/><br/>Billy Bob did a great job with Crockett. I don't believe I have ever seen Crockett played in such a way. He has always been a larger than life individual and Billy Bob's portrayal shows a more down to earth human side that is refreshing.<br/><br/>I like Dennis Quaid but I would not have cast him as Sam Houston. His portrayal was adequate but he does not bring to mind the Houston that I envision from my schooling. Someone like a younger Raymond Burr would have been more appropriate to me.<br/><br/>I am not sure how my fellow Americans will take to something that is part of Texas history. This is a good movie and tells a great story. Few Americans,other than the colonist, have the history of fighting for their independence. That does not make Texans any better, but it does give us a certain pride that few can understand. You can share in the that pride by seeing this movie."

"JagdtigerIV","10","0","0","20 March 2020"," A flawed but still great film
","Growing up in Texas, I was always fascinated by the Texas Revolution, the Alamo in particular. When the film was released in 2004, I watched it in theater and was eager.<br/><br/>The film got many things wrong but many things right. In comparing this to John Wayne's Alamo (1960) there is a lot of humanizing of characters. General Anna is shown as a brutal man by executing prisoners but also as a charismatic and intelligent officer.<br/><br/>Crockett, Bowie and Travis are also developed as flawed men who came to Texas to start new lives because their old ones failed, Travis ran out on his pregnant wife, Bowie was a land swindler, and Crockett because his political career ended.<br/><br/>General Houston is also more developed than John Wayne's version as a man fighting other officers and politicians as well as General Santa Anna. There was so much infighting with the Texian government and military that it nearly destroyed it and that is shown here.<br/><br/>The film gets many things right, the final assault being a night battle, the layout of San Antonio and the Alamo as it was in 1836. The only real gripe I have is having the Alamo chapel abreast of the convention ""Long Barracks"" when it was 50 or so feet behind it to make a small courtyard with the palisade manned by Crockett and his Tennesseans. The uniforms, weapons, mannerisms and characters are also more accurate than Wayne's version, though smaller in scale. Wayne used thousands of extras to form the Mexican army. Here they had a only a few hundred. Here though, the 2004 version went the extra mile getting uniforms, weapons, and even drill right. In the Behind the Scenes feature it's shown the production crew found a period manual for the Mexican army and used it to drill their troops. Quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Billy Bob Thorton bears an uncanny resemblance to the actual Crockett. He was made for this role. He steals each scene he's in.<br/><br/>Where are the flaws? It's not what's in the film. It's what was left out of it.<br/><br/>For a story this complex with so many events and characters, it's obvious that many things be either condensed or removed for the sake of moving the plot. I possess the film's official companion book. In it is a that includes a copy of the screenplay. It shows that so many characters and development was left out of the finished film.<br/><br/>Many characters and key moments were whittled down or removed from the final film. Alamo survivor Susannah Dickinson is left with just one line of dialog. James Butler Bonham, who left and returned to the Alamo with messages, had all his lines removed and is in only two scenes, one is his death, and sense he has no name and no development, his death is overlooked by the audience. General Cos was Santa Anna's brother-in-law, the officer that surrendered San Antonio and the Alamo in 1835, retook it in the final assault, and was later captured after he fled the San Jacinto battlefield. In the finished film, I think, he appears in two scenes and has no dialog.<br/><br/>The young Mexican soldier that is shown shooting and killing Travis is fictional though in think he embodies much of Santa Anna's army. His name is Jesus and the screenplay has him being forcibly conscripted before the siege. In the scene leading up to Crockett shooting off General Santa Anna's empulette, the General speaks with the reluctant soldier who bravely accused the General of hanging his father when he was fighting the Spanish.<br/><br/>Another fictional character was virtually eliminated from the final film was another boy named Matthew. He's briefly scene when Houston is drinking in the store at Gonzales pushing a broom. The screenplay has Matthew joining Houston's army after the Alamo and fighting at San Jacinto. As the Mexican camp is overrun, he and Jesus run into, shoot, and mortally wound each other.<br/><br/>Some scenes are available on the DVD version, Santa Anna marrying a young woman in San Antonio, complete with his aide Batres posing as a priest for the wedding. General Cos and his army leaving San Antonio after their surrender in 1835. But these are just a fraction of what is missing. If you want to see it for yourself, go get the companion book it's well worth it.<br/><br/>I pray that a director's cut is released of this film, restoring the lost footage and giving us a larger story. If that ever happens, I'll charge into the store to get it."

","This is the most accurate film about the Alamo massacre that I have seen. And it takes the time to bring out the very human personalities of the historical figures involved.
The savagery of those times and battles is clear and hard to dismiss. It was good to see the U.S. Army Regulars Andy-by-God-Jackson had sent down, in the film.
As the Texican Army retreats, the viewer *feels* the frustration and growing anger of its men, as Houston - fully played by Dennis Quaid - waits ... and waits. If that quote of him about Wellington is true, he had certainly learned from him.
(My GGG Grandfather Charles Jack was a 17 year old Scots British Army officer cadet in Belgium in 1815 - later he joined The British Legion in Bolivar's War of Independence in Venezuela.)
Patrick Wilson is a perfect Travis, as he would be a perfect Lt. Cdr Layton in the new Midway film. Great intensity.
And Jason Patric's Bowie is similarly vivid, unforgettable.
But of course Billy Bob Thornton's *David* Crockett is the film's showpiece.

","I watched this movie for my History through film class. 
This movie is about the battle of the Alamo and the history of how Texas became part of the United states. There were very few men fighting against Antonio Lopez e Santa Anna's army in the battle of the Alamo. On the American side there were such men as : James Bowie,William Travis, Davy(David)Crockett, and etc.. This film shows how one loss can turn into into a victory. <br/><br/>This movie was made in 2004 and I think that the special effects were good. I like the acting that was done in this movie. The acting done by Jason Patric,Patrick Wilson,and Billy Bob Thornton was very good. The setting used throughout this movie was good. <br/><br/>I think that the historical accuracy was pretty good throughout this movie. <br/><br/>I haven't seen any other movies that connect to this one. <br/><br/>Things I liked:
-The acting
-The effects
-The soundtrack(Violin(Davy Crockett))<br/><br/>I didn't have anything that I didn't like about this movie. <br/><br/>Summary:
Overall I really enjoyed watching this movie. I liked the history of this movie and I think the actors did a good job of showing the audience that history. I liked the acting and I would like to watch more movies with Jason Patric,Patrick Wilson,and Billy Bob Thornton. I would like more movies that are directed by John Lee Hancock. <br/><br/>Question- What does it mean to be a hero in this situation?
This movie shows the true meaning of what it means to be a hero. The men that fought for America in the battle of the Alamo stayed and stood there ground. Instead of trying to run these men stayed to fight for there country. Even when James Bowie was dying he stayed and fought, on his death bed he laid there with his pistol to fight the oncoming Mexican soldiers."
"FountainPen","4","0","0","28 December 2016"," The Battle of San Jacinto was the main event !
","It comes down to about 15 minutes (out of 2 hours, 17 minutes), featuring the folk-hero Davy Crockett. Everything before is a somewhat laborious and, frankly, oft-times plain boring, build-up to the main event in this much-repeated story of what is always touted as a supreme example of extreme bravery and patriotism in the face of overwhelming odds. Yes, bravery. We are left with the great slogan and rallying battle cry ""Remember The Alamo"". This is the key to the big picture. Mexican General Santa Anna realized the futility of what the Texans were doing at ""The Alamo"", as a one-time event. He had to take a firm stand for his country. ""Without tears, there is no glory"". We, as moviegoers, as the viewers of this historical re-enactment, are sitting there, waiting to witness the bloody outcome, the carnage, the vainglory, the posturing. As this production of ""The Alamo"" indicates, we need to look upon ""The Alamo"" as inspiration for ""The Battle of San Jacinto"" which sealed independence for Texas against the Mexicans, with the decimated army of American General Sam Houston demolishing General Santa Anna's beautifully-tailored, arrogant, well-supplied forces. ""The Battle of San Jacinto"" is not a kind of footnote to ""The Alamo"". San Jacinto was the main event."
"Wuchakk","5","0","0","18 August 2016"," The Awful Truth: A small group of brave men waiting to be massacred by a veritable army
","Released in 2004 and directed by John Lee Hancock, ""The Alamo"" is a Western about the 1836 siege and fall of the famous Spanish mission-turned-fortress by Santa Anna's army of a couple thousand disciplined troops. The Alamo is defended by a ragtag assortment of roughly 200 soldiers, militia men and volunteers, including the famous frontiersman & politician Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), loose cannon Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) and by-the-book militarist Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson), the latter two regularly butting heads. Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) is on hand as a significant peripheral character. <br/><br/>The more popular John Wayne version from 1960 is just all-around more entertaining than this generally dreary rendition, although this version certainly earns points for being more realistic plus giving Santa Anna considerable screen time (excellently played by Emilio Echevarría), the latter of which the Wayne version doesn't do at all. Not to mention, this version ends with the humiliating defeat of Santa Anna & his army in a mere 18 minutes just six weeks after the fall of the Alamo. The rallying cry of Sam Houston & the Texian Army was naturally ""Remember the Alamo!"" You could say that Wayne filmed the Spirit of the Alamo with everything that goes with it, like big historical speeches, while the newer film goes for a more realistic telling, including de-mythifying the various legends. When it comes to historical accuracy, this version is about as close as any Hollywood movie gets. <br/><br/>But keep this in mind: No movie has ever been made, or will ever be made, about the Alamo that's thoroughly accurate, except for the obvious gist of things. Why? Because ALL of the defenders were killed. Even the Mexican eyewitnesses who were there disagreed on the major events that took place. For example, there are those who claim Davy Crockett was killed in the assault, as shown in Wayne's version, while others say he survived the battle along with 5-6 others only to be captured, lined up, and executed, as essentially depicted in this film. So any movie you see about the Alamo is going to contain a lot of conjecture.<br/><br/>Dimitri Tiomkin's score in Wayne's version is a dramatic, thrilling and tragic multifaceted piece that captured the slow build-up, eventual battle and aftermath. Carter Burwell's score in this version is mediocre by comparison; while certainly adept and adequate, it's essentially a funeral dirge that puts a dreary overcast over the proceedings. <br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: I've seen this version of ""The Alamo"" twice and have mixed feeling about it. I prefer the more modern, realistic tone of this version to Wayne's rendition, as well as the time devoted to Santa Anna & his men, not to mention the inclusion of the Battle of San Jacinto. On top of this, the movie's spiced with numerous good-to-great bits, but – overall – it just comes across too flat and dull. Something needed to perk it up out of the cinematic doldrums. The depiction of the Battle of San Jacinto does this, of course, but it's the last 12 minutes of the film and too little too late. Perhaps too many cooks spoiled the broth. <br/><br/>The movie runs 134 minutes and was shot in near Wimberly, Texas, forty miles north of San Antonio <br/><br/>GRADE: C+ (5.5/10)"

"kgwyly-1","7","0","0","16 May 2004"," BETTER THAN REVIEWS LEAD YOU TO BELIEVE...BUT NOT GREAT
","Overall, a good movie that didn't live up to my expectations but far surpassed the many horrid reviews being written about it.<br/><br/>ACTING: First off, all the actors in the lead roles should be commended for the depth they brought each and every one of their characters, the standouts being Billy Bob Thornton and Jason Patric. Patrick Wilson was very good but I was left wanting more from his character. I love Dennis Quaid and he fits the part of Sam Houston physically to a ""T"". However, his performance seemed a little stiff and I felt that that as an actor Quaid was just trying to steal every scene he was in. And that just pulled me out of the movie. The real surprise to me here is Patric. While I've seen his work in other films, his portrayal of Bowie is so real because he is so conflicted and he realizes that he is just not a good man. Thornton is good in a similar fashion but I wasn't surprised by his performance. Thornton is one of those actors who gives you your money's worth no matter what the subject matter. So the fact that he would be stellar in this role is just a given. Whether or not Santa Anna's character is as maniacal as portrayed in this film, Emilio Echevarria never goes over the top except for one scene in which I doubt any commanding officer would ever, EVER take such a stupid risk. Not to mention he looks the part as if he was torn from a historical painting. Whether or not I agree with the representations of these historical figures is irrelevant. Unless you actually met these men and knew them as men you would be hard pressed to judge the filmmakers on the disposition of these historical figures.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: When ""The Alamo"" is good, it shines. When it gets overly sentimental, it drags big time. There are some nice directing flourishes by John Lee Hancock here, especially when he uses sweeping aerial camera moves over the mission or on the battlefield. There's one shot in particular that seems like it's from some generic action movie, but it makes perfect sense once the entire scene plays out. When Hancock tries to get overly sentimental with the residents of San Antonio de Bexar I silently groaned. When will directors understand that to feel someone's plight, fear, or torture that we do not need to see their face? Especially when it's the face of an extra! One last thing about shot selection is a scene with Bowie that seemed like it was completely from another movie altogether! It's a camera / visual effect trick that doesn't belong in a historical epic whatsoever. It horrified me. It's completely out of place both story-wise and genre.<br/><br/>PRODUCTION DESIGN: Michael Corenblith is fast becoming the man to reproduce historical objects and/or structures on film. He recreated NASA circa-1970 in ""Apollo 13"" and now he's reproduced San Antonio de Bexar so respectfully that you would think he had blueprints and photographs to go from when building it. Living north of San Antonio and just 10 miles or so east from where they built the replica of the Alamo, the sets gave me a hyper-real sense of delusion that I was actually watching a documentary about the battle. Check out the bullet holes in the structures of San Antonio de Bexar! Awesome!<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: Gorgeous photography by John O'Connor and Dean Semler. It's gratifying to see a night scene that truly feels like it is only being lit by candles. I had some problems with the whole blue light (or moon light if that is what the filmmakers were trying to achieve) thing for scenes involving masses of Mexican soldiers. I think it would have been scarier to just hear the troops advancing instead of the obvious. The use of shadows is very well done in some scenes but borders on the melodramatic quite a few times.<br/><br/>MUSIC: What a missed opportunity Carter Burwell let pass him by. The opening music (which is a solo act for the most part) is so more haunting and emotional than the full orchestra crap that rises up eventually. Some of this music is what kills some of the better dramatic moments in the film, especially the hypersentimental scenes. Despite the utter nonsense of the scenes (one in particular which is just ludicrous), Davy Crockett's violin playing is beautiful but never used quite right. The one scene in which he plays along (you'll get it when you see it) is so horrid and the next scene so utterly ludicrous that I wanted to scream at Hancock for the sheer stupidity of keeping the scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>OVERALL: *** out of ****"

His cannon shot was in answer to the terms of surrender with discretion, not a childish temper tantrum to Bowie<br/><br/>*Bowie and Neil had already made the decision to ""die in these ditches"" so it wasn't Travis's prompting of Bowie that makes him admit the place should be defended<br/><br/>*During the siege, the Texans didn't make only one sortie, but actually made several through out.  In this film we just have people huddled down during cannonade.<br/><br/>*The lull that seems to be inspired by Crocket playing the fiddle and one upping the Mexican band, was in fact a part of Santa Anna's plan to lull the defenders into sleeping after over 10 days without sleep.  He knew they would be slow to wake.<br/><br/>*Mexican soldiers shivered on the ground for more then 1/2 hour before the cry of ""Viva Santa Anna"" started going up, rousing the defenders before the actual assault began<br/><br/>*Come on guys, what about the defenders stopping 2 attacks so that the final one happened in light not darkness.  We have one single assault caring the fort here, ignoring the 2 botched 1st attempts and the chance to display the bravery of the Mexicans having to cross the bloody ground 2 times<br/><br/>*If you are going to take from Pena's diary, it wasn't just Davy that surrendered/was captured<br/><br/>*What about the man who didn't stay?  You can leave out the line if you want, but one man wasn't inspired by Travis to stay to the end.  What about James Bonham coming back through the lines with word of Fannin not coming?<br/><br/>*Not a single mention of Goliad?  Hello, almost 400 men shot in the back on Palm Sunday?  Seems to me that the cry at San Jacinto was ""Remember the Alamo . . . Remember Goliad"".  <br/><br/>*San Jacinto - the Mexicans weren't surprised by the Texans suddenly being there.  They were camped facing each other, and waited for Siesta time to attack.  Also Castillion was shot not clubbed when he crossed his arms. Santa Anna put on a disguise and tried to escape, his own men gave him away later when they recognized him.<br/><br/>*Santa Anna just a bit too much of a cartoon villain here.  A little hard to believe this is the strong man who was elected again and again president of Mexico.<br/><br/>There, I've vented what bothered me.  On the bright side the film does have great performances, surpasses all the other films in accuracy (still the above needle me), and the battle scenes are directed very well - VERY well for an inexperienced action director.  In spite of my complaints, I look forward to the DVD, and hope it is the Director's cut - and may have a few of the above in it."

","This movie generated much heat on the discussion boards, well before it even opened in theaters - much of it consisting of derogatory comments from Europeans and Mexicans about Americans, from Americans about Europeans and Mexicans, etc.  (There were some calm, reasoned observations as well, but these appeared to be in the minority.)  In any case, the sparring appears to have been mostly ill-founded.  While it has its faults, this film is neither a jingoistic pro-American lovefest nor a politically correct American-demonizing essay.  It is fairly well-balanced, though the Texian viewpoint is given somewhat more sympathy than the Mexican.<br/><br/>First of all - the primary set (the Alamo and environs) was wonderfully done.  A lot of research must have been put into this careful re-creation, and it shows.  The battles of the Alamo and San Jacinto were well-staged and realistic, though with minor flaws (discussed in a moment.)  And the overall cinematography was great.<br/><br/>The main characters were well-drawn and well-portrayed, warts and all. Billy Bob Thornton's Crockett was the best of the lot; if you take a painting of Crockett from about 1826, age the face ten years, and add a few pounds, you've got this Crockett.  There were a couple of ludicrous moments centered on him, but for the most part Crockett is believable.  His homespun humor, general humility, frontier skills, grudging agreement to fight, and even his unhappiness with the U.S. treatment of native Americans are all part of the package.  And his death may be the most accurate ever shown on film, if the De la Pena diary is correct.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid's Sam Houston and Jason Patric's Jim Bowie are accurately shown as heavy drinkers (Houston's name among the Cherokee was ""Big Drunk"") and Bowie's role as a land swindler is alluded to.  His death is a little overdramatic - it is highly doubtful that he was able to put up any fight at all.  (And I'm not sure how familiar Houston was with Wellington's strategy at Waterloo.)  Patrick Wilson's William Travis is devoted, uncompromising, and yet in a little over his head - and also has deserted his pregnant wife and his children.  (His fierce devotion to slavery was left out, for the most part, but the rest is accurate.)  And Emilio Echevarria, though about ten years too old for the part, looks quite a bit like Santa Anna and played him to perfection - his ruthlessness, fondness for military pomp, and predilection towards affairs with young women are all accurately displayed. (Echevarria would have been perfect had he been portraying ""The Napoleon of the West"" circa the Mexican-American War.)<br/><br/>Balance was achieved, at least in part, by pointing out the existence of Mexican natives on both sides of the struggle (especially Juan Seguin's cavalrymen on the Texian side.)  And by noting, in a conversation between Travis' and Bowie's slaves, that slavery was illegal in Mexico.  And by showing the absolute bloodthirstiness of the Texas army at San Jacinto, where they showed that two could play the ""no quarter"" game.<br/><br/>The history was generally accurate, though telescoped in a few places.  A couple of annoyances were that (a) the Mexican band playing each night prior to their bombardment of the Alamo did not, as far as I know, play the ""deguello;"" they broke that one out partway through the assault, and (b) that, while the assault columns did get into position very stealthily, the charge itself was ostentatious, with the ""adelante"" being bugled.  (In the movie, the troops are practically at the wall before Crockett discovers them.  At least the attack is correctly portrayed as taking place before dawn.)  And both armies look great - the Mexicans with regular uniforms for the most part, the Alamo defenders in varied dress common at the time (including top hats, beaver hats, etc.)<br/><br/>Also, the troops under Fannin at Goliad are mentioned a couple of times, but then the thread disappears.  In actuality, their fate was known to the troops at San Jacinto, who shouted ""Remember Goliad"" as well as ""Remember The Alamo"" during their attack.<br/><br/>Most of this is forgivable.  What truly mars the film is the presence of a few cheesy Disney moments.  Crockett's musical duel with Santa Anna's band is silly (though he did have such a ""duel"" inside the Alamo, against a Scotsman playing bagpipes.)  The most ludicrous scene is Crockett shooting off one of Santa Anna's epaulets.  Absolutely preposterous.  And they overdid the displaying of Bowie's legendary knife (though the knife itself looked about right.)  There are a few other such moments in the movie, and they are objectionable enough to drag it down to perhaps a 6.5 in my book.<br/><br/>
But it is still the most accurate Alamo tale yet put to film."
"gipper1","Null","0","0","18 April 2004"," Missed its Window of Opportunity (Slight spoilers)
","""The Alamo"" is a film that will garner appreciation (though, unfortunately for the folks at Disney, no money) with the passing of time. At soon as Disney announced that the original Christmas 2003 release was pushed back to April 2004 - to ""give director John Lee Hancock additional time"" - the ""bad-movie"" buzz began. Critics were ready to bludgeon the film when it arrived over Easter Weekend, and while many did less than sing its praises, none could really bring themselves to hammer it the way the negative buzz indicated they should.<br/><br/>That's because Hancock's new vision of ""The Alamo"" was not the all-brawn, no-brain, John Wayne-styled hero worship they had been ready to dismiss without thinking twice. Its principal goal is to dig up the men behind the myth, explore their motives and the heartbreaking reality they must have felt when it finally sunk in that their small militia gang of 200 would be left alone against a force of 4000 Mexicans. Sam Houston, Jim Bowie, William Travis, and (of course) Davy Crockett occupy an exalted place in American folklore as result of the siege, but Hancock is not particularly interested in that - he wants you to feel what it must have been like to be trapped inside the abandoned mission with no possibility of escape and little chance of survival. <br/><br/>In debunking the myth, Hancock delivered both a couple rousing successes and a couple of botched failures. As Crockett and Houston, Billy Bob Thornton and Dennis Quaid provide the film's best performances, consistent in their flawed and ultimately human character. This makes it not only compelling, but also true - after all, Crockett was not a god among men as Uncle Walt and Fess Parker want us to think, he was human, and saw Texas as a chance for political redemption rather than a place to flex his bear-killing muscle.<br/><br/>
On the downside, several sequences (in the particular case of Jim Bowie's storyline) make me believe Hancock didn't put that extra time in the editing room to good use. The storyline involving Bowie & his slave, his deceased Mexican wife, as well as the backstory of Travis' (Patric Wilson) flawed character, are provided only in glimpses and ultimately go nowhere. One instance during the final battle intercuts Bowie, literally on his deathbed, preparing for a true Texas-warrior final stand that ultimately is a letdown.<br/><br/>There are also some marks of brilliance - Thornton's final scene as Crockett stands out, a wonderful moment of romantic fiction taking place the morning after the battle (though there is constant debate over the nature of Crockett's death - did he go out in a blaze of glory or cowardly begging for his life? - many agree he WAS killed during the fighting and never met Santa Ana face-to-face).<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Alamo"" comes close, so achingly close, to unquestionable greatness that you can't help but wonder why it missed the window of opportunity. Certainly the delay had something to do with it. Hancock and his team should be proud of what they have done, but I must remark that they could have done better. In spite of the dismal box office performance, I hope Disney gives the film a full second-life on DVD, where Hancock can reincorporate what I can guarantee is a plethora of deleted scenes to present his full vision of ""The Alamo"".<br/><br/>FINAL SCORE: 7.5 / 10"

","In an era where long movies are in vogue, after watching ""The Alamo"" I left the theater asking myself where was the rest of the movie.  At 137 minutes there is little question that the Movie could easily have been 10, 20, 30, or even 60 minutes longer with out upsetting too many people.  The short version of the film seems to deny the vewiers of the story behind the story.<br/><br/>I have a couple other minor complaints about the movie, If you are going to fire a 18# smooth bore canon on film, actually go out and fire one so that you see what they look like in real life.  Do look at other movies and say that is real enough.   In the Movie there was no recoil in any of the canons when they were fired and very little smoke, both of which are totally wrong. The same goes for both smooth bore and rifled muskets.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that it was difficult for movie goes to keep track of characters in the film.  They all sort of looked alike, acted alike and there was almost no way to tell them apart at first. Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Sam Houston was very well done, however the I think the editing of the film robbed him of a great acting job."

","The less said about this film the better. It forms a kind of ironic bookend with the Wayne widescreen classic epic, ""the Alamo,"" from 1960. The Wayne film was, in my view, the greatest movie of all time; look up the comments of Oscar-winning directors George Stevens and John Huston if you need evidence. This ""Billy Bob"" version is the worst of all time. The Wayne film is fondly remembered for its incredible battle scenes, particularly the death scenes of the Alamo's legendary ""big three"" heroes, Davy, Bowie and Travis; its emotion, the line-in-the-sand scene, for example; its cast, Wayne, Widmark, and Harvey were incredible and deserved Oscar's; and its haunting film score by Dimitri Tiomkin setting a standard for modern classical music. You can't say Alamo without hearing ""the Green Leaves of Summer"" or the Deguello in your mind. By contrast, this Billy Bob version is just awful -- no action, no drama, no stars, no film score, and the film was shot in the dark. Photography 101 is highly recommended before opening the camera lens. The Billy Bob film reduces Wayne's film's cast of ""thousands"" to a cast of ""tens."" I shut off my DVD of the BB version at the point Billy Bob as Davy warned the Mexicans after his capture that he was ""a screamer."" I am told the movie went on for another half-hour. Ugh. I tossed the DVD of Billy Bob's Alamo in the trash and immediately viewed the 1960 classic to get the Billy Bob version out of my head. To paraphrase Tiomkin's ""Ballad of the Alamo"" from the 1960 film, ""Let the legend of the 1960 classic grow and grow."" Thank you, John Wayne."

It's long winded, often without need, and it includes precious little action or excitement. I realize, of course, that the point here may well have been not so much the battle as the attempt to capture the spirit of the drive for Texan independence, and the desire to be freed from the oppressive Mexican regime, but still, it has to include something interesting.

","Unlike the 1960 version of the Alamo starring: John Wayne (Davey Crockett), Richard Widmark (Jim Bowie), and Lawrence Harvey (Sam Houston).  This version did nothing to towards building peoples faith in heroes.  I sat and watched this movie with my wife, and actually looked at my watch several times.  This movie seems to have been concentrated on tearing down the Alamo's heroes and making them out to be cowards that were there because they had no other choice.  If someone wants to know if Davey Crockett was scared of his fame let them read a biography or history book.  The story of the heroes of the Alamo is a story of pride, desire, and fighting for something.  It may be true that Jim Bowie, William Travis, and Crockett never went there to fight Santa Anna intentionally, but the story or legend or whatever it has become since the actual events took place have become a part of pride.  People want to believe that heroes are above all others. People know heroes have faults, but people have to believe that through their faults their heroes fought for what they believed in and stood up as heroes for their beliefs.  The only two reasons that I voted 2 instead of 1 for this film were two of Thorton's (Davey Crockett) scenes.  First was the Fiddle serenade with the Mexican drums in the middle of the siege.  Second was the only scene that showed the heroism I have been mentioning, that being when Thorton (Crockett)was tied up on his knees after the battle and told Santa Anna to surrender and he would let him live, then was set upon by the Mexican soldiers while screaming at them, knowing he was a dead man. Watch the 1960 version if you want to see heroes!! The 1983 version was better than this one!!"

","I preferred the John Wayne version. This movie was disjointed, the story was easy to follow but the characters, except for Santa Anna were unreal. None of the defenders really evoked sympathy for their plight. Why didn't the director get advise from a violinist prior to filming the unrealistic Billy Bob Thornton fiddling. I believe that the regular United States Army had uniforms, even back in the days of the Alamo. The Mexican Army looked quite realistic and all the Mexican Officers and soldiers looked the part. This movie has little to recommend it. I suggest you go the video store and rent a copy of the John Wayne version, which, although perhaps not quite as historically accurate, at least had character and was good entertainment."

Plus, all the characters aren't really given much equal screen time so it's also disappointing because the viewer then can't connect at all with any of them. And despite enjoying all the actors, whenever they gave a speech, it never really had any effect on me at all which is what these films are supposed to do which is wrap you into their conflict or at least ""see the light.""

","I consider myself quite open minded when it comes to film genres, as I will, basically, watch anything regardless of what type of film it is. Of course, I have my preferences; but I believe that a good film will shine through whatever genre it hails from. However, if I was to choose a genre as my 'least favourite', historical period drama would probably take the honours. That, coupled with the fact that I consider American history to be one of the most boring subjects ever means that, basically, I am in the wrong movie with The Alamo. However, since I have spent two hours of my life watching this film, I feel I have the right to comment, and that is something I intend to do: <br/><br/>Basically, this film suffers because it's BORING. If you're going to tackle a dull subject, the least you can do is tackle it in a way that is going to be interesting for the audience. Intrigue can be accomplished via a number of methods; character development is one of them, a strong story is another; but this film manages to capitalise on neither. Main characters die and major events happens and, quite frankly, I couldn't care less. This is not good for a film that is supposed to be portraying an important historical event. The Alamo also gives off a very 'cheap' impression, and that coupled with the fact that it received an almost completely incognito release makes the audience feel that they have stumbled upon a made for TV film. The fact that the battles are poorly, and very much under, done doesn't exactly bode well for the film either. This film is also a personal landmark for Dennis Quaid, as it is his second terrible film of 2004 (the other being, obviously, The Day After Tomorrow). At least Billy bob Thornton approaches his role with gusto, but his over-American performance hardly saves it.<br/><br/>Basically, you could do something better with this part of your life. If the subject of The Alamo interests you, then I recommend finding a book on the subject or maybe even checking out one of the earlier films, as they're bound to be better than this dismal affair."

","""The Alamo"" is by no means a terrible movie but it also is far from a memorable and impressive one.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint about this movie is the way the story is brought. The story is told like it's a 10 parts mini-series. The story is filled with all kinds of (unintersting) personal struggles and motivations of the characters. There are many slow moments in the movie in which really nothing interesting happens and at times too much 'blah' is going on. Also the characters are just totally brought wrongly to the screen. First of all, there are too many characters introduced in the movie without that any of them are ever fleshed out. People who have no knowledge of American history and the story of the Alamo in particular will have an hard time understanding who all these characters are and what their exact motivations are. It was also kind of cheap by the filmmakers to put all kinds of ethnics groups in the movie and they concentrate on them too much. That whole thing with the Mexican and African-American volunteers inside the Alamo was completely unnecessary and it felt forced. Perhaps another good example of what I exactly mean with that the story was told like an 10 part mini-series. It was like the filmmakers wanted to be completely political correct in every aspect. Of course there also are some inevitable patriotic moments but in this case I can live with them.<br/><br/>Another character problem was the main villain. The villain, Santa Anna is not portrayed like an historical person but like a typical stereotypical Hollywood villain instead, or James Bond villain as many people often refers his character to. He is too over-the-top mean, ruthless and just completely heartless. It makes the character a totally unbelievable one.<br/><br/>The casting of the movie is also completely wrong. Dennis Quaid was truly horrible and he went way over-the-top with his character and accent in particular. Why one Earth the ever casted Jason Patric is also still a mystery. This guy has totally no charisma. Thankfully there still is Billy Bob Thornton who seemed to be the only one that portrayed his character correctly and in a good and somewhat fun way.<br/><br/>For me the battle sequences were also somewhat disappointing. They failed to impressive me and the sense of scale was missing at times. Still you can tell that they were made with lots of profession and skills involved, it had some good looking effects.<br/><br/>It's a still somewhat entertaining movie to watch, even though there are some slow moments in the movie I was never really bored. It's an enjoyable movie to watch but it simply never becomes impressive or even emotionally powerful, even though the story of the Alamo itself is of course a powerful and heroic on its own.

","Sometimes history just never does really come to life on the silver screen. John Wayne learned this way back in 1960 when he starred and co-directed (with the uncredited John Ford) ""The Alamo"". The film was a giant bust and even though it survived due to a very generous group of Academy Award voters and friends of John Wayne, the mega-superstar was still somewhat disgraced as a film-maker and made out to be a performer who really knew very little about closed-doors Hollywood. Fast-forward 44 years and we have another version that just makes Wayne's version look that much better (not an easy feat to accomplish by the way). ""The Alamo"" in 2004 is a myth- and legend-filled bore of would-be epic proportions that puts itself in the embarrassing class with recent flops like ""Wyatt Earp"", ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"". The setting is Texas from 1835 through early March of 1836 when the titled Catholic mission in San Antonio, Texas fell under a 13-day siege from Mexican dictator/royal military commander Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana (played by the admittedly excellent Emilio Echevarria). The ambush though lasted mere minutes as a few thousand Mexican soldiers finally stormed a make-shift military base that housed only about 200 Texicans (old-time Texans and Mexican-Texans who had American and/or Mexican backgrounds). Why did this event drag on for nearly two weeks then? Very simple.......Santa Ana wanted to get Texas General Sam Houston (played by the always drunk Dennis Quaid) baited into the large graveyard along with legends Jim Bowie (Jason Patric), William Travis (Patrick Wilson) and Davy Crockett (a strangely alluring turn by the always impressive Billy Bob Thornton). Historically Houston would make Santa Ana have his Waterloo (well actually one of several for the on-again-off-again Mexican dictator) with San Jacinto, a surprise attack battle that took place shortly after the Alamo disaster. Texan director John Lee Hancock (who had a little success a couple of years ago with the over-achieving ""The Rookie"") gets caught up in silly dialog by ""Traffic"" screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (I still cannot believe he wrote this script) and then gets mired in spectacle (which is not that impressive to start with) and loses the focus on his interesting characters (Santa Ana and Crockett in particular). Historically the film is not very accurate either. Crockett's final moments are mythical and the Battle of San Jacinto was a total surprise attack in reality (that is why it took less than 20 minutes for Santa Ana's Military to be defeated there). In this film it is made to look like a realized confrontation and it was not. Also Santa Ana got caught at San Jacinto with his pants down literally as he was in his tent with a woman aka ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"". That too is never shown here and we are left with yet another inaccuracy. In this situation the history would have been better than the script itself. In short none of the people who worked on this know too much about Texas history and it is painfully evident as the whole production becomes a long and tiring teleplay-styled dud. Patric and Wilson are totally unwanted. Jordi Molla (as Seguin) seems to be the focus early, but disappears before we get to even know who he really is. Thornton uses his down-home country boy routine to humanize Davy Crockett and Echevarria is the production's strongest point as the cold, brash and flashy Santa Ana. Echevarria is one of those great actors (making a real name for himself in recent triumphs like ""Amores Perros"" and ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"") who no one seems to know or care about. I really wanted a movie about Santa Ana instead of the Texans because really he was the only believable and reputable element of the whole winding mess. Brick by brick, ""The Alamo"" falls with a tremendous thud that I saw coming before the first act even hit its half-way point. 2 stars out of 5."

","So, I really didn't like this film at all. I know that seems like there is nothing that I like lately, but for some very strange reason the quality of pictures seem to be diminishing rapidly. As I attempt to watch as much as I can from the video store wall, I cannot help but discover the poor nature of nearly everything Hollywood is releasing. The Alamo is no different. Here we have a group of men lost in a production befuddled film that would rather have the perfect ""visionary"" shot instead of actually telling a decent story. Creativity and originality seem to play second fiddle (pun is intended) to safe moments where our director could easily say ""historically correct"" instead of showing us any ounce of the truth. There had to be some darkness in that bottomless pit known as the Alamo, yet Hancock didn't seem to focus on that at all. I cannot help but wonder what type of film this would have been for Ron Howard and Russell Crowe to complete. Literally, this film felt like a second-hand thrift store. ""B"" actors filling in for table scraped parts that Crowe and Howard didn't want. Jason Patric, Patrick Wilson, Dennis Quaid, and Billy Bob just didn't seem to fit the mold that I was hoping to see. They did not accurately portray the ""Wild West"" as I was hoping to see. Instead, I felt I was watching this glorified account of death done by pretty actors that would give the ladies a reason to go to the theater.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am a bit to bitter about this film. I know that I should only dwell on the positive, but as each film progresses with poor results, it is hard to even see the positive. In fact, after the several films I have just watched I am nearly to the point of saying that Hollywood has gone completely to the dark side. I understand that his was a historical picture, but does that mean that creativity and originality are thrown out the window and into oncoming traffic? I would hope not, but apparently Hancock had other thoughts. From watching the special features of this film in which Hancock talks about the production of this film, he focuses so less on the actors performances and more on the actual set that you can only calculate why there was less attention to the actors and more on the scenery with the final product. As I watched the glorious overhead shots, the wondrous cannonball pan-through, and several other fantastical war scenes, I couldn't help but think to myself on how this should have been a story about people, not places. I do not think that Hancock accomplished this, or  really from the looks of it  tried.<br/><br/>With a central focus on the scenery and less on the acting, this creates a level of acceptable mediocrity with our actors. Honestly, there wasn't one that stood out in the crowd as a ""riveting"" performance. Each did their parts, brought some historical honesty to their lines, but overall it was Billy Bob being Billy Bob playing Davie Crockett and Jason Patric being Jason Patric playing Jim Bowie. I don't know if this makes sense or not, but I could not see these actors in their corresponding roles. I half-expected Dennis Quaid to come out of the forest at the end, ripping his shirt off, and pulling a Last of the Mohicans right there in front of God and his country  but he did not. In fact, he really didn't do anything except utter fragmented sentences from his dialogue that created this smart aura around him, when actually it was nothing more than Dennis Quaid being Dennis Quaid playing Mr. Houston. It was, to use a favorite word of mind, pathetic. I couldn't get the actors out of my mind. I couldn't see them in their respective roles, and this hurt the film. Directors have to realize that big names do not equal big film. Smaller, independent names could have carried this film on their shoulders better than these veterans did. Again, I cannot ponder enough about what the dynamics of this film would have been like if Randy Quaid were to jump aboard. Has the two brothers done anything together? I think The Alamo would have been a grand beginning.<br/><br/>Overall, this feature did not impress me. I know it bombed horribly at the box office, and now I can see why. There was nothing of value throughout the entire picture. From the uninsightful acting, the glamorized vision of war, and even the complete lack of structure (needing to focus more on man instead of nature), The Alamo proved that big budget can ruin a good history lesson. Sadly, I am not sure what could have saved this picture outside of a complete gutting. Have you ever walked into a room in which the walls were so moldy that you knew that you were going to have to rip them down to build a solid frame? Well, that was the feeling behind The Alamo. The walls to this picture were moldy and completely unstable leading to a flimsy frame. If only more time would have been spent working on the important elements instead of the ""Hollywood"" moments, this may have done a bit better. Until that time arrives, I do not recommend this film to anyone, especially those with any sort of passion for our nation's history. I do believe it would cause mass professor spitting and a rebirth of the duel.<br/><br/>Grade: * out of *****"

","As a historical war film, THE ALAMO isn't bad at all. It tells an interesting, rarely-covered story in a mostly realistic way, and it has enough workable performances from the lead actors turning legendary figures into real-life characters to make it worth a watch. The main problem with it lies in the existence of the 1960 John Wayne version of the story with the same name; that movie was an epic, full of drama, action, and pathos, and by comparison this is weak sauce indeed.<br/><br/>Both films are lengthy but I didn't start to fidget in the Wayne version as I did here. The battle scene in this version, when it comes, is more realistic but less gripping and somehow less violent than in the Wayne version. The casting is a mixed bag too. I like Patrick Wilson but he's just starting out here and has a lot to learn; his performance is much more mannered than in a film like BONE TOMAHAWK. Jason Patric barely registers and Dennis Quaid's role is rather pointless. Best of the lot is Billy Bob Thornton, whose Davy Crockett is a typically offbeat and unique portrayal, but other than that THE ALAMO is merely so-so."
"markstenroos","7","1","2","5 October 2016"," A decent film that could have been so much better
","Personally, I have never understood the adulation for the Texicans who died at the Alamo. These were for the large part a group of swindlers, cheats, reprobates, adulterers and who knows what else lowlifes who were fed up with the good ol' USA and decided to hitch their fortunes and futures to the government of Mexico. When things didn't go their way on that account, they decided hell, let's form our own country, our agreement with Mexico be damned, driving the Mexican military out of Texas.<br/><br/>Things didn't go so well after that, at least at the Alamo. But America loves its pseudo history and heroes, so we continue to make movies that tend to whitewash the ugly parts of our history. <br/><br/>That is not the case with this movie, which gives us the clearest account of the men who fought it out at the Alamo, warts and all. We finally get to see these legends put in the perspective of what and who they really were, and it isn't flattering, to say the least. <br/><br/>Indeed, one doesn't come away from this movie feeling much sympathy for the defenders of the Alamo. Davy Crockett shows up thinking the fighting has already ended, and as his friends die around him during the final battle, he expresses not any patriotic or heroic thoughts, but regret that he got his friends into ""all this."" Bowie, Travis and the rest are cut down without fanfare, or a star turn at dying with dignity and profundity. As Santa Ana tells his officers, ""what are soldiers lives but like those of chickens?"" Apparently, that goes for the Texicans as well.<br/><br/>Speaking of Santa Ana, he comes off quite well in this film. Was he a dictator? Sure. Dictators were the norm at that time. Was he cavalier in sending his troops to their deaths by marching them into fire in wave attacks? Not according to the way wars were fought at the time. Santa Ana was prescient (in the movie, at least) by realizing that the Mexican people would forever be under the foot of the Americans if they couldn't defend and hold their territory. He declared the Texicans to be pirates, and adopted a ""no prisoners"" policy. In the movie, he calls the Texicans ""bandits,"" which they were. The discipline of the Mexican army stands in stark contrast to the rag-tag Texicans, who indulge in a false sense of security by convincing themselves that the Mexicans would never be able to reach the Alamo quickly, as doing so meant marching 300 miles in the dead of winter. Well, guess what? They did it, taking the Texicans totally by surprise (and suffering tremendous casualties in the process). The hubris of the Texicans shows - they had no idea what they were up against in Santa Ana's army. <br/><br/>Worse, as Bowie tries to negotiate a truce, Travis fires off a cannon shot, provoking Santa Ana in declaring that no prisoners will be taken, though he does show compassion by allowing any Mexican in the mission to leave under a flag of truce before the battle ensues.<br/><br/>The professionalism of the Mexican forces also stands in stark contrast to the Texicans. The clear chain of command in the Mexican army allows for discussion of tactics and philosophy, even if Santa Ana stands as final arbiter in making a decision. Compare this to the ""every man for himself"" power struggles going on between Bowie and Travis, and one realizes there was just not enough time available to the Texicans to gel into a disciplined fighting force that could win the day.<br/><br/>Visually and story wise, this is a very good film. The casting is good all around, with Billy Bob Thornton producing a unique and honest portrayal of Crockett. Where the film fails - and fails miserably - is in the musical score, which is boring, repetitious, and in many places at odds with what is happening on screen. This is no more true than in the final Alamo battle scene, which would have been more effective without any music. One doesn't expect or want a John Williams Star Wars-style composition for this scene, but almost anything else would do. The score is completely at odds with the battle, leading nowhere, highlighting nothing, without crescendo or climax. It is really awful.<br/><br/>I think the film would have been much improved had the subject of slavery (Mexico outlawed it, Texas wanted it) been more deeply explored. And there are many other aspects of those 13 days - raids and other pre- battle operations - that never seem to get mentioned or even hinted at in the movies.<br/><br/>That aside, this movie is definitely worth seeing at least once. I find the denouement after the final Alamo battle to be both anticlimactic and entirely unnecessary. The Sam Houston-led battle is under-manned, small of scale and looks cheap, especially as it follows the battle at the Alamo itself.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10, with most of the stars withheld due to the lousy score."
"SimonJack","6","1","2","2 November 2013"," Accurate battle scenes, but a flat film otherwise
","The filmmakers went to great effort and expense to have a definitively accurate movie about the Alamo. The Alamo fort, dress and military uniforms, weapons, livestock, and setting were reproduced exactly to the 1830s. But, while this 2004 film may have hit the mark as the most historically accurate, it loses out in appeal and interest otherwise. The loss is in a very weak script, mostly bland characters and poor acting. <br/><br/>There are likely accurate records of the Alamo defense, Santa Ana's deployments and the battle and defeat from accounts of survivors. Among those were the messengers sent out, Mrs. Dickinson, Joe, and others who left before the battle. But there was no written record of the dialog and discussions between the main characters and others. So, this is all fiction, as it is in most films. And the fiction in this movie is mostly dull and lifeless. The script had no energy, emotion or passion. <br/><br/>Then, there is the cast. I'm not one for picking on directors and producers for ""miscasting"" actors, but this movie tempts me to make an exception. Only one role stands out in this film – that of Santa Ana by Emilio Echevarria. He did an excellent job with an interesting piece of script. But, after him, all the rest of the principals fall flat. <br/><br/>I have seen Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton in some very good roles. But they are terrible in this film. Again, it may be partly due to the bad script and poorly imagined dialog. Except for some snarls from Jason Patric, there's nothing to remember about James Bowie from this movie. Patrick Wilson is fair as Travis, but is just too young for the part. Quaid over-acts with most of his lines, and when he doesn't have a line or word to speak, even his grimaces and frowns seem forced and unnatural. This is the worst I have ever seen him in any film. <br/><br/>The biggest goof, I think, is in the character of Davy Crocket, and Thornton's portrayal. Except for the one short scene demonstrating his expert marksmanship, Davy Crockett comes across in this film as a wimp. There's nothing in this role that suggests a pioneering woodsman, adventurer, or frontier hero. Indeed, the filmmakers instead wrote a character who apologizes for his exaggerated image of folklore. So, they wrote a 21st century apology or correction into a story taking place in the early 19th century. Sure, we know that there were many overly- inflated tales about Crockett then. But did the real Davy Crockett go around meekly apologizing for the made-up image of him? <br/><br/>I can't understand the filmmakers casting Thornton as Crockett – especially since they wanted to be as accurate as possible. Thornton doesn't fit the ""build."" Crockett had a large frame and was a tall man. The Davy Crockett Almanac and Book of Lists (2000, by William R. Chemerka), gives a description of Crockett as ""about six feet tall and 200 pounds, no surplus flesh, broad shouldered, stood erect, of great physical strength, fine appearance, swarthy complexion"" In the early 1800s, the average male height in the U.S. was about 5 feet, 7 inches. That would have made Crockett stand over most other men by 5 inches. A tall man, indeed. While Thornton is 6 feet tall today, the average height is 5 feet, 11 inches to 6 feet. So, he's about average; and in the film, many of the players around him were taller and bigger. The role called for someone in the range of 6 feet and 4 to 5 inches. The 1960s John Wayne Alamo seemed to be more accurate in the physical proportions of its cast. <br/><br/>One last historical sidestep in the movie has to do with the end of the battle. A few months before the Alamo, Texans had defeated the Mexican army and driven it out of Texas. The Mexican soldiers apparently were wary of the determined and feisty Texans who were defending their land. So, as the last of the Alamo defenders fell, the Mexican officers couldn't restrain their troops who walked among the fallen defenders and continued shooting and bayoneting the bodies. Perhaps that would be a little too much realism or accuracy to show in a film that appears to be a ""feel-good"" tale about the past."
"pkzeewiz","4","1","2","12 June 2010"," much better than the John Wayne version.
","This is the story of the Alamo in Texas where a group of soldiers tried to hold off the Mexicans from entering Texas and getting to Sam Houstons camp. Col. Travis gathered up many volunteers to help him fight including Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett. The battle happened and they were out numbered greatly and almost all completely killed. Later the Mexicans were ambushed by Sam Houston's soldiers and in less than 18 minutes the war was over, those who died at the Alamo died for nothing.<br/><br/>This is NOT a remake of the John Wayne classic as many people say. It is the same story, because it is based on a moment of history, but this version is way more accurate. Waynes version had most of the men very heroic and it was way over the top and made out to make it more glorious than it was. This movie had the men being more human. Davy Crockett, although still to this day is revealed as a legend, in this film he tells his story of how he is nothing more than a man who did a few great things, but is not the giant he was made out to be.<br/><br/>I liked this story and thought it was entertaining. The direction was pretty good and acting was good as well. I liked Billy Bob Thorton and loved Patrick Wilson. Dennis Quaid, although on screen very little, did a great job. I must say that Jason Patrick leaves much to be desired as an actor, however. The music in this movie was horrible and was perhaps the worst thing about the film.<br/><br/>The film plays hard on clichés, but it got to the point faster. The war starts rather quick in this film and there was a lot of action. I would recommend it to those who like historical, war or westerns. 4/10 stars."
"CitizenCaine","6","1","2","18 July 2005"," New Alamo A Troubled Production, But Worth Seeing
","The Alamo was a troubled production with Ron Howard giving up the directing reins to John Lee Hancock over budget woes. As is the case with most similarly troubled movies, they don't do well at the box office. As a result, this film was a resounding thud. It may be due to its historical origins more than anything else. There are always expectations that are not met, or arguments about authentic details and so forth. Today's blockbuster demographic is used to seeing heroics that are far more unbelievable on screen than are depicted in this film. Hence, boredom is sure to set in long before the film gets to its climactic moments. However, the film is historically interesting despite scenes that drag at times. We get a strong sense of what kind of lives people led then. The foreboding of battle and the fates of the characters are communicated in unequivocal fashion. The film touches on a few things make this more than just a passing film: The Tejanos caught between the two sides was similar to what would happen thirty years later during the Civil War, and the film suggests that the stories surrounding the legendary characters we are familiar with might be more myth than fact. The film stars Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crockett in a great performance, realizing that it's hard to live up to what people say about you. Jason Patric is James Bowie of Bowie knife fame, who demonstrates heroism as he lies dying of tuberculosis. Patrick Wilson is William Barrett Travis, the young, brash commander of volunteer forces defending the Alamo, who rouses the men to battle near the end with a memorable speech. Dennis Quaid, as Sam Houston, doesn't have much to do until the last third of the movie; he portrays Houston as a wise, patient military strategist with an authoritarian aura. Emilio Echevarria is Santa Anna, an immoral tyrant, who has no respect for the lives of his own men even. The concluding contrast between the falls of the men at the Alamo and Santa Anna is a little too pushy and perhaps Hollywoodized. The cinematography of Dean Semler is terrific considering the fact that he faced the challenge of filming most of the movie between dusk and dawn. The battle scenes, though long in coming, do not disappoint us in their detail and gruesomeness. One of the main weaknesses of the film is that we do not know the characters well by the end due to the fact that there are so many. Although a bit slow at times, it's worth seeing. **1/2 of 4 stars."

I won't go into the detailed movie minutiae as many have before me but i must say that the use of movie time was extremely poor. I knew Marc Blucas was in the movie and I knew he was playing Jon Bonham, one of the central figures of the Alamo story and one of the most heroic (even in New York schools we learned about him). I then spent the entire movie waiting for Bonham's ride. I caught Blucas behind an actor in one scene and writing a last letter home in another. Um - what? I then find out that they did film Bonham's rid and obviously other footage to support this but it was cut out so that we could see a lot of grand sweeping shots of the Alamo at dawn, at noon, at dusk, at night... Oh! We also got to see Santa Ana molesting some woman and twenty-minutes post-Alamo of Sam Huston. I have read that the director plans to release a Direcor's cut DVD with this footage restored and I hope he does. But when a big part of your hype about a movie is the historical accuracy and you leave out a huge chink of that history and disrespect an extremely heroic act (Bonham did not have to be at the Alamo at all, he chose to go there and bring troops with him to support his friend, even knowing that he would more than likely die)in order to have your obligatory 'powerful man sex scene' left in, well..."

I was really looking forward to this film back in December, before its release date was pushed ahead to April, which really had me wondering, ""Why the change; Is this film a disaster?"" I eventually found myself in dismay, scratching my head and wondering, ""Is this the best they could have done?"" The film lacks important focus, the patriotic, spirited mood of the heroism inside the monument I had perceived in History class; in fact, you can hardly follow the characters from Jim Bowie to Davy Crockett, because the dialogue and their significance in the story is so minor and detached, that you just assume Davy Crockett was a regular figure among the men at the Alamo. The editing is hurried and somewhat disturbing; scarcely is one scene focused upon for more than five seconds, and thus, the entire mood of the film is diminished and you are left merely waiting for some action. Once the siege begins, while some scenes are quite effective (e.g. when the Texan nobly places himself in the line of fire and scores a ""hit""), we are so tired of the lifeless story and dull dialogue that we merely yawn at the fate of the men in the Alamo. We hardly care what happens or who wins, because the story is so dragging and uninvolving, and other elements which could have spicened the mood of the story (e.g. direction, dialogue, and editing) are so melancholy, and you find yourself glancing constantly at your watch, waiting anxiously for the end. If not for the effective, if historically inaccurate, ending of the San Jacinto siege, this entire film would be one big downer and a complete waste of two hours.

","The Alamo is a reasonably entertaining movie.  There's good acting throughout and the final battle scene is really mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Having said that, I now need to post a spoiler alert.<br/><br/>
They played fast and loose with a lot of the facts, and left out one of the most moving moments of the entire Alamo saga.  For whatever reason, the makers of this film seemed to have a real dislike for David Crockett. They continually downplayed his character throughout the movie, making him appear nothing more than a opportunistic, greedy buffoon.  The ending of the movie showed Crockett being captured and brought before Santa Anna - total horsecrap.  Crockett was killed in the fighting; his body was observed by one of the few survivors (Susanna Dickinson) as she was brought out of the Alamo.  In addition, one of the slaves (Ben) also identified his body.<br/><br/>And they totally omitted the line in the sand incident.  Travis spoke to the men and gave them an update on what was happening.  He then drew a line in the sand and gave the men the opportunity to stay and fight by crossing the line, or to attempt to leave.  Moses Rose was the only one who chose not to cross the line; he escaped later that night.<br/><br/>If you're willing to overlook several glaring factual errors, you'll like the movie.  It saddens me to think, though, that many people will see it and believe it is historically accurate.  If Hollywood is going to make a film about an historical event, they should either do it right or not do it at all."
"Jerrycrt","Null","1","2","9 April 2004"," Not bad
","A BIG step up from the 1960 picture that was more ""Hollywood"" than ""History. In defense from other reviews ... the ""line being drawn"" is Hollywood - not history. It never happened.  Also, Travis was only 26 at the time of the battle.  Bowie was 50 - so in the film, I think it is Bowie who is too young for the role.  I think the film looks great, and quite accurate; however, one of the things that bothered me was that it seemed to have gone through some serious editing - it did not build suspense (as in Zulu, or even the Wayne ""Alamo,""), and I did not get the feeling they were holding out for 13 days.  The use of subtitles (more than usual, to change scenes), makes me wonder if this film was cut down for running time reasons. Billy Bob Thornton gives us the best characterization of David Crockett ever presented on film.  Having just read the bio on Crockett, ""The Frontiersman,""  I was amazed at how he brought the man to life to the point where he fit every image I had in my head after reading the bio.  Remarkable.  I thought the final battle was over too fast in the movie, and again, I didn't feel the ""tension"" leading up to it.  BUT - it is still a FANTASTIC film that brings another chapter of American History to life on the screen; and I think many people will have new respect for the Alamo."

","So far, The Alamo (2004) is the most accurate film made about this episode in the history of Mexico and Texas. But it also is full of unforgivable historical mistakes. <br/><br/>Many things were changed since the fully Americanized 1960 the Alamo. Is the first time it is shown a preconceived plan from the Unites States to revolutionize Texas, but this film is still very much an Americanized story. They omitted again to almost all fighters in the Alamo and the Revolution of Texas were illegal immigrants and they are still shown as righteous heroes, even with the music in the scenes. Santa Anna was a son of a bitch and that if it is perfectly represented in this film. <br/><br/>1960's The Alamo was 200% Americanized, this one is 85%.<br/><br/>Mistakes: *They use the word Texas all the time, even when they show the name of the cities, but Texas was not Texas in 1836. It was the State of Coahuila y Texas. *Santa Anna was not a dictator in 1836, he was constitutional elected president. He ruled Mexico as dictator from 1853 to 1855. *The Mexican Constitution of 1824 was not voided by Santa Anna, it was changed by a Conservative Congress 9 months after the battle of the Alamo. *In Mexico never existed coins with the face of Santa Anna, even when he was dictator, never ever. *The order to kill all the rebels, was an order from the Mexican Congress, not Santa Anna's. Santa Anna just ran anti-piracy law issued by Congress. *Santa Anna's character is an old, when he was 42 years in 1836. *The Mexican army was asleep when Houston attacked; they were not on guard as is shown in this film.<br/><br/>Maybe my opinion is not worth much, because I cannot feel sorry for some people who fought for dismember my country after all my country gave to them (land in credit, no taxes, bilingual laws, etc.) if they had remained in their country they had not been killed by an army that only was defending its country. <br/><br/>And for those who do not understand, just imagine a group of illegal immigrants along with some legal, creating a revolution in any U.S. state in order to annexing that state to Mexico.

This movie failed to inspire anything in the viewer. The characters were thin and without definition. If I hadn't read about Jim Bowie I never would have known who he was! I have to admit that Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thorton did good jobs portraying Sam Houston and David Crocket, but everyone else might as well have been cardboard cut-outs! Lets not forget that this movie is not even close to being historically accurate and a little biased in favor of Texas. According to the movie, the only reason the bumbling Mexicans won was because Texans seem to have a habit of falling asleep on sentry during critical moments (haven't seen that one out of Hollywood, have you?) Overall, this movie was a waste of rental money, it dragged out trying to convince you to feel something for these poor people while Hollywood-script events take place around them.

","Good grief, this is a dull film.<br/><br/>Director John Lee Hancock, a Texan native, obviously wanted to create the most authentic film of ""The Alamo,"" but in his attempt to be so reverential, he forgot that he had a story to tell. Along with two other screenwriters - Leslie Bohem and Oscar-winner Stephen Gaghan - Hancock created a film where none of the characters is all that interesting.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that none of the main characters is fleshed out. Be it Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton), James Bowie (Jason Patric), Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) or William Travis (Patrick Wilson), every major character is thoroughly one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Thornton's the only one who gets a role with some bite. But Crockett, too, is underwritten, and at the end of 137 minutes, we still know very little about the man. As for the others: Houston's essentially a cameo starring a well-known actor and Bowie seems to be in the film only because the real character happened to be at the Alamo for the 1836 standoff.<br/><br/>Hancock's film runs about 25 minutes too long. There are too many peripheral moments that don't add up to anything much, including Bowie's dreary flashbacks and delusions. There's even a flashback within a flashback. Hancock seems so intent on getting the period details right, that he completely ignores that a film should first tell a good, compelling story. Yes, the story of the Alamo is such a tale, but this film slights all the major players by making them poorly written characters.<br/><br/>The only exciting aspect of the entire film is the novel use of the Spydercam. This camera, hung on high wires and propelled by computer, swoops, swooshes and gives us aerial shots in lieu of cranes or choppers. It's used very effectively, especially in the battle scenes.<br/><br/>This is a film you should watch on DVD or video with your finger on the fast-forward button so that you can zip past all the tedious stuff - and, believe me, there's plenty of it - and get to the well-done battle scenes. But the film lacks grit and, honestly, I couldn't have cared less about any of the people in ""The Alamo.""<br/><br/>I have no doubt as to Hancock's earnest desire to make a factually correct film version of the events at the Alamo. But sincerity does not mean the film automatically will be good. This one's a lumbering, ponderous attempt to tell an exciting true story. It's no wonder this film was plagued with production problems and that Disney delayed its release by several months."

I was not sure whether I was watching a flashback or if the movie had caught up with itself. The characters were not very well developed, therefore, I did not care much when/if one was killed. The story, jumping back and forth, was mostly focused on legendary characters(James Bowie and David Crockett) and not the whole conflict of the actual Alamo. It seemed more like a ""tall tale"" than an actual historical reenactment.

Sure enough, in order to attempt to be a crowd-pleaser, the Americans have to end up in victory.<br/><br/>Bill Bob Thornton plays Davey Crockett who just a good ol' boy known as a legendary modern day hero. Even the Mexicans know this.  Like the Mexican General, the Crockett character grins too much for his own good.<br/><br/>Jason Patric plays the famous knife fighter Jim Bowie.  You're just waiting for the classic Crocodile Dundee line, `That's not a knife. This is a knife' when Bowie practically pulls out a machete.

How to describe the dull dialogue, one-dimensional characterizations (with the exception of Billy Bob Thornton's exceptional ""Davey Crockett""), and the claustrophobic view of the Alamo fighters who apparently were not respected by either the film's writer or director.<br/><br/>And, there's one line that seems to sum up the politically correct view of those involved with the film - the line - something like - the Mexicans are fighting for Mexico, the Texicans want to conquer the world. <br/><br/>
On the other hand, in John Wayne's ""The Alamo"" the fighters are treated with respect, both American and Mexican.  There was a story and dramatic line that carried you from the beginning to the end.  Situations that were unclear in 2004's murky pc film were presented clearly, thoughtfully, and with solid dramatic impact.  And the acting -- Lordy, Lordy -- Richard Widmark's feisty Jim Bowie, Laurence Harvey's powerful, yet prissy Col. Travis, and Richard Boone's powerful Sam Houston....<br/><br/>What's the phrase - there were giants then...With a strong thumbs up for that exceptional actor - Billy Bob Thornton, who unfortunately could not singlehandedly save the current film.<br/><br/>John Wayne respected his material, respected the people.  The writer of the 2004 version toyed with the material and provided dialogue of little consequence.  Subtlety does not appear to be his strong suit as he hands Billy Bob Thornton one-liners, shows Jim Bowie as a one-dimensional consumptive, portrays Col. Travis as an uptight incompetent and General Santa Anna as part peacock, part buffoon.<br/><br/>Let's face it, since everyone's long dead and gone, a writer has lots of freedom in which to create his fantasy of what really happened at the Alamo and both movies have silly scenes that don't track.  But, with all of that, I'm left with that old cliche - they just don't make them like they used to."
"gpsmall","2","2","8","5 October 2004"," Emotionally flat, vapid, pretentious epic wannabe
","This movie was agonizingly boring. The screenplay was a pretentious attempt at creating an epic from an historical event. The actors all seemed to be saying their lines as if the film was a walk-through rather than the final cut and the lack of apparent emotion was the inevitable result. The director compounded the problem by lingering through scenes in a vain attempt to generate some emotion by fixating on the actors for what seemed like minutes after nothing new was occurring. The result for the viewer is a feeling that you are viewing a film in slow motion-indeed I used the fast forward repeatedly to move through the DVD version of the film to avoid such moments of stultifying boredom. To no avail, however. The only saving grace was that the movie was historically accurate, unlike the John Wayne version. I also question the political correctness of a movie that again shows the Alamo solely from the perspective of the caucasian American settlers who led the revolt against Mexican authority. 44 years ago, when the original Alamo movie was filmed, Hispanic-Americans were marginalized in American society and no one cared if they were bashed in films. However, it now seems totally disrespectful if not ethnically perverse to film a new version which fails to convey a Mexican and Tejano perspective on the conflict. Like Lincoln, Santa Ana had to decide whether to allow a substantial portion of his nation to secede or to attempt by force of arms to assert authority over the seceding regions, such as Texas. And many Tejanos (Mexican natives of Texas) resisted Santa Ana's attempts to reassert central authority over Texas, preferring autonomy from Mexico City. Without such Tejano support it is unlikely that the relatively recent American arrivals could have succeeded in their quest for Texan independence. Yet the movie offers no portrayals of or allusions to Tejano political support for Texan independence. It would also have been interesting to see how the Tejanos were ultimately dispossessed in large part after Texas obtained statehood, despite the financial and military support of many Tejanos for Texan independence."

","The first time I saw this film I felt a little deflated. It seemed to me that they had turned an undeniably heroic stand into a sort of unexciting event. I've seen the movie twice since on tape, and have liked it a lot better, finding it thoughtful, intelligent, well-acted and probably closer to the truth of the matter than any other films on the subject. In other words, it grew on me. A decision was obviously made to tell a revisionist, thinking person's story, not a flag-waving one. I suspect that many thinking persons will enjoy this 'Alamo', whereas those seeking a more traditional action film with the usual heroics will be disappointed. This is not everyone's cup of tea, but it is honorable and tries to tell an honest story. The depictions of Bowie and Crockett are fascinating and intentionally anti-myth. My favorite scene in the movie is Billy Bob Thornton as David Crockett with his violin on the Alamo wall. My greatest complaint about the film is that they could have livened up and dramatized the actual battle more without compromising anything, just heightening the picture. The final assault is curiously flat and uninvolving -- sort of matter-of-factly told. All-in-all, a fair effort and decent telling ... but it seems to me it should have been higher adventure. I think the definitive version is still yet to be made."

Neither the character development nor the artistry seemed to capture the imagination. The historical deployment seemed good, but it still leaves one to try and check the history books to see if all characters were dealt with fairly.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie is even more realistic than the 1960 Alamo version done by John Wayne. John Wayne seemed to be somewhat guilty in his movie of mixing his opinion with the movie facts - but that ended up actually quite well I thought in the 1960 version. John Wayne treated all in his movie of all nationalities, US, Mexican and other races with high regard. That seemed a very nice gesture. But the real memory of the 1960's John Wayne Alamo movie was the artistry - the playing of the song ""Green Leaves of Summer"" as thousands of Mexican soldiers gathered outside the Alamo. For whatever reason, that seemed a very emotional scene in the 1960's film that just was not there in the remake.<br/><br/>But again, I would highly recommend even this new version as a movie well done and well worth watching."

","This is the genre the Hollywood movie should be at its best - historic film inspired by the American history. This film is not one of the best in its category. <br/><br/>I actually am a history fan, but I am not very familiar with American history. Maybe I am close to ignorant on some respect, because I did not know before this film for example that Houston was a historic figure, and only vaguely knew about the Alamo. The problem is that the film did not help too much, and not being familiar with the characters of the period I had quite a hard time understanding the American characters views and differences. I have no complains, this is not supposed to be a documentary, but...<br/><br/>Sure, for the external world the story of Alamo does not tell too much. Non-American viewers do not resonate to it the same as do the American viewers and the Texan war that touches American patriotic cords is for other just another war fought almost two hundred years ago between two remote countries. The way the characters are divided between good American and bad Mexican may be by default right for the American viewer, but needs more argument in the film for a foreign viewer. The way its done, it makes me suspect some kind of stereotype. The Mexican general is presented too stupid to be credible, and showing him merciless to the defeated and corrupt morally does not help. Neither are we explained well why the soldiers and volunteers in Alamo fought with such fanaticism, nor why do they not send their families to safety. <br/><br/>There also is a missed opportunity for a great theme, with Sam Houston, having sacrificed his friends and fellow citizens for a bigger goal. However, if there was a moral dilemma for Houston in his acts, we are not shown it, instead we are instructed in his military tactics.<br/><br/>Moreover, the film seems too long, not much develops in characters, and if you are not really in the military history not much happens here. I liked more the drama in 'Cold Mountain', to take another American history epic, it had more interesting and powerful characters. The best act in Alamo was by far the one of Billy Bob Thornton, he is really fun to watch, but not enough to sustain a really good film.<br/><br/>'The Alamo' is a film to watch, but it does not exceed the level of mediocrity. 6 out of 10 on my personal scale."

Every detail of the movie, was exactly how the history books have depicted it. I was born in Oklahoma, raised in Louisiana, and have lived in Texas for three years. Texas has a lot to be proud of, and by reliving what happened at the Alamo, we all felt the pain and the loss, then revenged it, by making Texas a part of the United States. We all should be proud to say, that nearly everyone in the world joined Sam Houston in the Battle of San Jacinto, to secure Texas' fate. I've seen commments from other people, despising the United States. We're the greatest free country in the world, and we welcome those who want to be a part of the United States.

","I'd like to start by saying this:<br/><br/>The battle that ensued at The Alamo was NOT a part of American History. It was a part of TEXAS history.<br/><br/>During the stand-off Texas declared it's independence from Mexico, thus making it a sovereign nation.  It wasn't a part of Mexico, it wasn't a part of America.  It was Texas.  For those who want to refute this fact and want to continue to claim otherwise, tell me one American history class you've been in that has talked about the Alamo.  On the flip-side, every Texas history class I've been in this has been a huge cornerstone of the class.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point...<br/><br/>Since most of you north of the Red River have never taken Texas history, your comments sound ridiculous to those well versed on this subject.  Much of the movie is historically accurate.  I was actually surprised.  There were a few glitches...but mainly it got the message across.  Well at least to most of us...<br/><br/>Some of you guys posting missed the point entirely.  Those too busy commenting on camera angles and lighting...hahaha.  Are you guys serious? Were ya'll so engaged in that ya'll missed the content of the movie?  The fact that some of you said the men staying at the Alamo was stupid and that this movie is an attempt to make them heroes is appalling.  In the middle of the damn movie Sam Houston (played by Quaid) signs Texas' independence. Yeah...these guys were fighting for nothing.  It was stupid for them to stay.  I've never heard such asinine comments.  I can only be happy you idiots are watching movies and reviewing them and not fighting for my or (gasp) your freedom.<br/><br/>It would do many of you some good to open up a book and stop relying on a movie to capture EVERYTHING...from lighting to camera angles to the musical score.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this is the best movie ever made.  But it's a damn good TRUE story.  And I applaud anyone who tries to tell it."

","Texan John Lee Hancock certainly has the name to direct this revisionist epic but it lacks the bluster, hysterics of the liberties with the truth John Wayne production. Instead it is a prosaic and po faced film that feels too long and when the action finally comes you are reminded of Zulu and at one point you even sense Michael Caine will enter the Alamo shouting at the Mexicans not to fire any more cannons.<br/><br/>Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) is a man living up to his legend but offered a monetary incentive of land and political power to fight for an independent Texas which at the time was held by Mexico. General Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) is a boorish drunk politician organising a land grab, Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) is ill with TB but swaggers with an out-sized knife. Lt Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson) the earnest military leader who needs to earn respect from his troops.<br/><br/>The film by wanting to flesh out its main characters ends up making the narrative choppy. As we wait for the epic battle, it just feels like an interminable hiatus but the film never misses a trick to show up Crockett as epic. If I had spotted him playing the fiddle I would had taken a pot shot at him.<br/><br/>The Mexican leader is portrayed as an arrogant cartoon villain but the film's big mistake is not to include the history of Texas and give the audience who are not versed with American history some kind of potted history lesson of the lone star state that was not part of the USA and under Mexican control who as far as they were concerned were well within their rights to keep control of it.<br/><br/>The film has tremendous sets and art direction, it tries to address the issue of slavery, the irony that Mexico abolished slavery and the whites wanted independence so they could maintain it. You see Bowie's slave thinking for a moment that he might had been set free and the film ignores the fact that other heroes in this movie were also slave owners."
"screenman","4","1","4","16 August 2011"," Yet Another Alamo
","It's the third millennium and time for yet another revisionist movie. Most commentators seem to agree that this version of the Alamo siege is the most historically authentic of them all. Well, that's as may be. I'll have to take their word for it. I'm no student of American history.<br/><br/>However; it is supposed to be entertainment. It's a movie. It's not billed as a documentary, nor even a docu-drama. If I really want historical accuracy I'll opt for a documentary. Or read scholastic history books (though even they are often inaccurate). When I watch a movie, I want entertainment. I'd like authenticity too - but not at the cost of viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>This revisionist piece stars Billy Bob Thornton, along with wooden Mr Quaid. Adequate, but not exactly top drawer. It runs for some 2 hours 17 minutes, but - goodness me - it seems a great deal longer. I felt as though I had sat through the entire '13 days of glory'. I don't believe I have ever experienced a more gloomy, maudlin, self-indulgent piece of theatre. Incidental music assumed the substance of a dirge.<br/><br/>There's also a fair share of soul-searching in John Wayne's original epic, but that's offset by spectacle, comedy, and irony in the grand old style of Hollywood sagas. Wayne's 'director's cut' ran for well over 3 hours, but was hacked down to about 2 and a half for its release.<br/><br/>I love John Wayne's version. It may be preposterous, over-blown, and have little regard for truth. But it's a truly great movie - lavish, well-paced with progressively-building tension, and beautifully filmed. There's a script that intelligently meets every dramatic turn, with characters that are interesting and varied. And, of course, there's Big John himself - larger than life, full of panache and unique style, and a tremendously capable actor. He's balanced against Richard Widmark's surly, scathing Bowie. And the whole thing is bolted in place by a grand music score from Dimitri Tiomkin. As a movie; it's a classic tour-de-force on par with 'Zulu'.<br/><br/>Give me Wayne's romantic mythologising any day. As they say in 'Liberty Vallance' - when the legend becomes truth, print the legend'. Purists are welcome to Billy Bob & Wooden Quaid's revisionism; for me it's just a relentless bore and a half. Despite its presumptions of historical fidelity; I didn't enjoy watching it. And what's the point of that?<br/><br/>Not recommended."

","As a Texan, I was thoroughly involved in this film and enjoyed it up until the battle's aftermath. For whatever reason, the director/writer/producer made a clean break from factual history and decided to have Billy Bob (Davy Crockett) become the only survivor, who then shows his grit and guts toward Santa Anna before being bayoneted to death. Perhaps at this point they worried if people were still watching, so they try to tantalize the audience by showing Davy Crockett in a chance to beg for mercy and the ""goosebump-inducing"" scene of defiance. Any historian or any Texan knows everyone died at the Alamo, even good IL' Davy during the battle. I've never been so disappointed with the ending of any film, and the fact that it was tossed in there for whatever idiotic reason is a slap in the face and an insult to all Texans and insults the memory of what happened in 1836."

It wasn't a war so much as a massacre, but that's a debate I'll leave to the historians.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's far from great, but it's not that bad, either. Fairly middle-of-the-road, actually.

Yes, the movie did a good job of keeping the facts straight, and even had a few scenes that were done exceptionally well.  But this movie just didn't depict the events that occurred there in a way that kept an audience interested.  I couldn't tell you why either.  Maybe it was the slow pace.  Maybe it was the mediocre acting. Maybe my panties were in a bunch and I was just uncomfortable sitting there.  All I know is that I left the theater feeling like I had seen a movie that just should have been better then it was.<br/><br/>Now the one thing I did like was Billy Bob as Davy Crockett.  No, I take that back.  I loved Billy Bob in the movie.  He captured the character in a way that kept my eyes glued to the screen in every scene he was in, and I am not a Billy Bob fan.  But he sold me with this performance, and in my opinion, kept the movie from flopping completely.<br/><br/>So, if you're a die hard Billy Bob fan, this movie is probably right up your alley.

I don't count any historic inaccuracies against it, because the Alamo is a mix of history as well as myth.<br/><br/>I thought the movie could have done without certain lines.  Most in particular was during the actual siege of the Alamo, Crockett's friend said ""They've killed me Davy.""  Just a little to cliche for me. I enjoyed how the movie showed some character depth, especially Davy Crockett struggling with his fame.  I also thought the battle for Alamo was well done.  It was realistic, none of the defenders slew scores of Mexican soldiers before they were killed like you might see in some other versions, they were all killed rather quickly. After the movie was done, I must say that I wasn't blown away.  But I enjoyed the movie, I was entertained, and it was definitly worth seeing on the big screen.  6/10"

At one time I even counted a flash-back within a flash-back within a flash-back. It was never established as to WHY these people were even willing to die in Texas at the Alamo in the first place.  Also it was never brought out that the Mexicans hated Santa Anna just as much as the Texans.  And, to lead men into a futile battle where they are surely going to die, Travis, I'm sure wasn't such a sniveling little coward crying at the first sign of danger. He HAD to give a motivated rallying cry to convince, what men he had left, to stay and fight.   While Billy Bob's performance was, as always, superb, Davy Crockett was a bold, braggart - given to great oratory and a leader, which was never shown.  He just shows up in Texas with a bunch of men for no particular reason?  To portray Crockett as a clownish buffoon gives little credence as to why books were written and plays were made about him during his own lifetime and also being elected as one of the first Congressmen for Tennessee.  He was a very integral part of the expansion of the country at the time.  He was, by all accounts, before being elected to office a true frontiersman.<br/><br/>No wonder Ron Howard took 2nd billing in the producer's credits on this film.

I agree with the other reviewer. The best scene in the movie was Davey Crockett accompanying the Mexican Army on the fiddle.  Patrick Wilson was NOT Travis. I'm not sure if it was bad acting, bad editing or a combination of the two but, the movie never gave you a sense of what the Texas Revolution was about and what these men were fighting for. It was choppy and hard to follow. I think movie goers who do not already know the story will be lost. The movie was filmed ten miles from my house. The backdrop to San Antonio looks like what I see out my back door. It did not look like San Antonio de Bexar. The terrain is all wrong. It looked like Dripping Springs.

Then in the battle of San Jacinto, you see the Texan army advancing with a US flag and not a Texas Flag. Also, the Mexican army was resting that day, in the movie it shows them in ready position to attack the advancing troops. If you are into history, this is not a movie to see.

","The Alamo  as a battle  has been adorned as being the stuff of legends in American history. It brought about the death of American folklore heroes Davy Crockett and James Bowie, allowed Sam Houston to rise in power and fame and came complete with a vile villain in the way of General Santa Ana. So why is it that 21st Century America is so fascinated with the deconstruction of said legends? At times, such realism hurts the story and that ended up being THE ALAMO's downfall.<br/><br/>Leslie Bohem, Stephen Gaghan and John Lee Hancock's script tries to shoot for an accurate description of the events leading up to the battle and the humanity of the major players involved. Perhaps that was achieved, but a middle-aged Crockett reminiscing on the brutal trials of war doesn't make as compelling a tale worthy of the King of the Wild Frontier. The same can be said for Houston's alcoholism and Bowie being a slave owner. Billy Bob Thorton's acting  and fiddle playing  is what helps save his character's reputation. <br/><br/>If anything, it is the Mexicans that come across as being efficient and even noble in their own way. Their uniforms are pressed and they fight as a regiment. No wonder they won the battle. All America had to offer were soldiers more caught up in their own problems! Even the battle at San Jacinto, which was supposed to give the film a positive American ending, merely felt abrupt and tacked on, much like the final war scene at the end of Michael Bay's PEARL HARBOR. <br/><br/>Even with the base story, at least THE ALAMO looked good. Hancock provided great camera moves with a clean, slick look and nice edits, especially when the action kicked in. Most impressive was the total tracking of a cannonball flying into the Alamo itself. <br/><br/>Fans and history buffs might praise, or reject, Ron Howard and the film's other producers on trying to achieve an accurate telling of the Alamo's fall but in doing so all the elements of wonder and excitement these names of legends fabricate instantly become meaningless. John Wayne's ALAMO proved that even though the Alamo was lost, American pride, gumption and that stubborn spirit of ours lives on; that even the worst of times can still bring out the best in Americans. Hancock's version does little more than bring pity to the dead."

For one of the few times we get what the battle meant in context of the fight for freedom. The problem is that in trying to cover so much the movie plays like a History Channel special come to life, there are too many characters and too many events to fill a two hour movie. You want to care more than you do, but you can't since most of the characters remain largely cyphers.

","The Alamo tells the oft-repeated story of the last stand of Texas soldiers, including some famous historical figures, in the face of overwhelming odds. This historical event has been the basis for jingoistic nationalism so many times in American history it's gone beyond cliche.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Disney didn't go down the big flag-waving path with this film. They have attempted to weave a tale around the characters involved, characters with their own personal trials and flaws. We see Jim Bowie laid up with cholera and pneumonia. We see David (not Davy) Crockett trying to come to terms with his own fame. We see William Travis attempting to turn from pompous dandy to leader of a doomed garrison. We even see the minor characters in this tale: the Mexican soldiers who fought under the Texas flag; the slaves of Bowie and Travis; the young Mexican soldier who doesn't want to die; Santa Anna's officers who see his fallibility and ultimate cowardice.<br/><br/>These were all noble efforts on the part of Disney. Problem is, they didn't quite pull it off. It's still too much of a Wonderful World of Disney production, with largely uninteresting dialogue and generally weak character development. The acting is pretty good, the production values are not stellar but decent, it's just the script that falls flat. Just when they start to get interesting with one of the characters, they cut away and never go back to what made it interesting.<br/><br/>So I had mixed impressions.

","It seems as if, in an attempt to make the well known battle of the Alamo new and refreshing, director Hancock has taken out the very things that made the story of the Alamo such a classic. For one, there is absolutely no character development in the entire movie, and the viewer feels no emotional attachment to any of the characters. For an action movie, the action scenes seemed to be extremely brief and repetitive: fire the cannons, duck from the cannon shot, fire the muskets, duck from the musket shot. Even in the final battle of the Alamo seemed anticlimactic and brief itself. The addition of Sam Houston's defeat of Santa Anna at San Jacinto was a nice touch to give the movie a more positive ending, but seemed to stretch the movie to an even more anti-climatic level and made you ""forget"" the Alamo.<br/><br/>However, the Alamo did present a somewhat new look at the battle with the unorthodox deaths of the main characters, none of which went in a blaze of glory except for maybe Crockett. This adds a disappointing, but more realistic spin on the way wars go. The focus on Sam Houston's part of the story allows the viewer a broader perspective than other Alamo movies do.<br/><br/>This version of the Alamo is decent, but can in no way compare to the 1960 version, which is crammed full of epic battle sequences, extraordinary character development, great scenes, and a thrilling climax. I would rate this with the other action flicks of this time, such as King Arthur. It has such potential, but seems to fall short of a classic."

I resent the attempt of the producers to make this movie a source of American pride. The history taught today in our schools is tainted enough without Hollywood adding to it. I am not a Texan, but I do have an IQ higher than Highway Speed limit signs, and was taught history back when truth was valued higher than politics. U.S. Senator Crockett received a lot of flack from his fellow members of Congress for leaving Washington to go and fight for the independence of a nation other than that of the U.S. (Note that no current members of Congress or the House have done so today, even though many hold reserve commisions in the military.)<br/><br/>After the events at the Alamo, the Republic of Texas did join the United States, but the Alamo remains a proud part of the history of a nation other than the U.S."
"gregsrants","6","1","6","11 April 2004"," Two hours of foreplay for a PG-13 battle
","As a Canadian, maybe I was at a disadvantage watching The Alamo.  In school we were primarily taught Canadian History so my American historical knowledge is pretty much extracted from what I saw on television or seen in the movies over the years.<br/><br/>With this void of reference, the movie was a bit of a surprise for me.  The Alamo actually fell to the Mexicans?  I had no idea.  Davy Crockett was killed at the legendary battle? But what about his television show? Did the Mexican's really attack just one day before their big cannon was to arrive? With each passing scene, I seemed to be more out of touch with what I thought or understood about the infamous 1836 standoff.<br/><br/>What I did know however was all the Hollywood shuffling that took place during the production of the 2004 version.  Made widely public last year was the fact that Ron Howard and Russell Crowe were set to direct and star, but there were arguments with Disney and both dropped out.  I also knew that this movie was set to be released in December 2003 for Oscar consideration, but the studio pushed back the release explaining that director John Lee Hancock was still editing the film (yeah, right). <br/><br/>With all the negatives about the film found weekly on Entertainment Tonight and in Entertainment Weekly, the film was starting at a disadvantage before the lights even went dim in the theatre.  Add to the mix that the historical geeks would be all over the film for inaccuracies (as they are with any film based on a factual event), and viola, instant we-can't-win cinema.<br/><br/>This Alamo tells the story through four central characters.  There is the roughened James Bowie (Jason Patric) who has the respect of the men but is slowly succumbing to consumption; the young unrespected-at-first William Travis (Patrick Wilson) that is responsible for leading the troops against their formidable foe; the chiseled war veteran Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) who is legendary in the eyes of the Mexican army; and of course, not donning a raccoon hat is the popular and charismatic Davy Crockett played wonderfully by Billy Bob Thornton.  <br/><br/>These characters are known to anyone who has studied Texas history, but to us ignorant folk, we were at the mercy of director Hancock to educate us, and I must be completely honest here, I wonder just how many liberties the guy took.<br/><br/>For instance, did Davy Crockett really play his fiddle one night resulting in the respected non-action by the Mexican army for the first time in almost a week?  Did Sam Houston actually refuse to help the Alamo only later to become a hero in folklore?  And was James Bowie that ill that he fought Mexican soldiers from his deathbed?  All could be true, and if so, I will be very embarrassed for my comments, but on the surface, it seemed unlikely.<br/><br/>What I have uncovered since my viewing is that these four characters were incredibly interesting.  They all had huge egos and even larger drinking problems.  Each had no luck with women (or women with them depending on the slant you want to put on things).  They were a group that didn't particularly like each other, but rose to the occasion to defend the Texan frontier. <br/><br/>I wondered if spending time on the clashes these men might have had between each other would have been better than the gibberish each of these men orate while the audience awaits a form of battle.  Not just gibberish I should add, but gibberish set to arousing music.  The movie seems to be one rally-the-troops speech after another and there is a roaring musical score when anyone does anything other than speak.  Sam Houston walks out of a tentqueue the music.  James Bowie does up the buttons of his uniform from bedqueue the music.  I go get more popcornqueue the music.  In fact, I haven't witnessed such gross placement of a films score since John Rambo accompanied an orchestra into Vietnam.<br/><br/>All this leads to an eventual battle, that quiet frankly, doesn't even live up to the production values of Braveheart some ten years earlier.  We see explosions that throw people through the air, we see gunfire and bayonets, but I guess being Disney, there was no blood in the storage room beside Mickey's ears to use on the battlefield.  It made me feel like I wasted $13 on something that could have been seen on afternoon television.<br/><br/>
But it really wasn't so much the battle as it was the 2 hours of foreplay we are given that bothered me the most.  The trailers had me enthused thinking I was about the see some heroic war where the little guy stood up the bully and lost but not without a fight.  Instead, I was subjected to long talks, fireside speeches and the deteriorating health of a major character. Compelling, but then why call the movie the Alamo?  I think Texans Who Await Death, would have been a more apt title.  So, remember the Alamo?  I have pretty much forgotten it already.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"
"Buddy-51","5","1","7","3 April 2005"," Forget ""The Alamo""
","In the early part of the Nineteenth Century, the area now known as the state of Texas was the scene of a massive tug-of-war between the Mexicans, who claimed ownership of the land, and the Americans who were determined to gain independence for the territory so that it could one day be subsumed into the new, ever expanding nation to the north. The 1836 siege of the Alamo played a crucial role in determining the outcome of that struggle. For it was here that a group of 187 Texans chose to make their stand against over 3,000 Mexican troops led by the famed Santa Anna - and lost their lives in the process. This turned out to be a short-lived, Pyrrhic victory for the Mexicans, however, for the totality and brutality of the slaughter so outraged the Texans that the phrase ""Remember the Alamo!"" quickly became the official rallying cry for Texas independence, which was won soon after.<br/><br/>""The Alamo""'s all-star cast includes Patrick Wilson as William Travis, the Lieutenant Colonel who led the American forces; Jason Patric as James Bowie, the consumptive knife-fighter and leader of the Texas militia; Billy Bob Thornton as Davey Crocket, the legendary Indian-fighter-turned-United-States-senator; and Dennis Quaid as General Sam Houston, who chose to sit out the siege but who managed to extract swift and total revenge against Santa Anna and the Mexican army a very short time later.<br/><br/>The film is most effective when it deals with the history surrounding the event, even though a number of historians have raised serious objections as to the veracity of much of what is shown on screen. Still, when virtually every single person is dead at the end of a battle, it is a little difficult to come up with the primary source, eyewitness testimony one would need to compile a reliable historical account of the incident. Speculation is obviously going to play a very large part in any dramatic recreation of the event, so I think the moviemakers can be given some slack in this area. However, it is as dramas that such movies are judged, and here ""The Alamo"" doesn't score nearly so well. Admirably, it has attempted to see its larger-than-life characters in relatively life-sized terms, but in its attempt at humanizing the participants, it often winds up sentimentalizing them instead. Crockett, in particular, falls victim to this problem. So obsessed is he with playing down the near-mythological, iconic status his previous exploits have garnered for him, that he becomes little more than a simpering revisionist bore in the process.<br/><br/>""The Alamo"" also suffers from a malady common to films based on well known historical events: that of knowing the end of the story going into the movie. It leads to an even more serious problem here than it did in, say, ""Titanic,"" because, at least in that film, even though we knew beforehand that the ship was going to sink, at least we didn't know exactly which characters were going to go to their watery graves with her. In the case of ""The Alamo,"" all we can do is wait for the final battle to commence and watch as each of the characters suffers a common fate.<br/><br/>Because the majority of the film's 137-minute running time is taken up with the 13-day-long siege and standoff, the pacing often leans towards the desultory and the languid. Most of the time is spent with the characters sitting around and waiting for help to arrive, not exactly a scenario designed to provide edge-of-the-seat excitement for the viewer. Most of the acting is wooden and stiff, although Thornton brings a few nice touches to his portrayal of Crockett, even if his golly-gee-aren't-I-just-like-everyone-else boyishness begins to wear a mite thin after awhile. There's also an undercurrent of xenophobia running through the film in its one-sided portrayal of the opposing forces. Santa Anna, in particular, is reduced to the level of a stock villain, stopping just short of twirling his (admittedly nonexistent) moustache at moments of extreme dastardliness. Needless to say, there's been very little attempt to humanize him.<br/><br/>The actual climactic assault on the Alamo has been impressively mounted, although we are strangely unmoved by all the deaths we see happening before us. Interestingly, it is only in a different scene - the one in which Houston's army chases some fleeing Mexican soldiers into a river, brutally and senselessly slaughtering them in the process - that the filmmakers capture the ugliness and madness of war. More scenes like that might have made ""The Alamo"" less of a total rout for the audience than the Alamo was for those involved in the real thing."
"jpmd88","5","1","7","3 May 2004"," Avoid this like a root canal
","When I first saw the trailer I was a bit apprehensive about watching it in actuality but the historical significance of the film is what actually brought me to buy the ticket for this movie.    There is not much to play around with the story since the subject matter is based on a historical event.  There are 2 previous versions of The Alamo listed in IMDB, one made in 1960 and the earlier was in 1936 anything before that was probably the event itself.  Kidding aside, I haven't seen the earlier films hence I cannot make a good comparison.  This 2004 version is in my opinion too Hollywood for my taste because they are sticking to the tried and true formula typical of movies made in Hollywood in the last ten years or so. There is the typical `braveheart' scene where Gen. Houston played by Dennis Quaid pep talks his men before the obvious slaughter of the Mexican army. There was a bit of an overkill in the final minutes of the movie where Houston's men began wantonly killing Sta. Ana's troops as they retreat from their `Waterloo' so to speak.  Jason Patric as knife fighter James Bowie wasn't too convincing as he tried to play the funny guy against Patric Wilson's serious character William Travis.  Billy Bob Thornton as the legendary Davy Crockett seemed like a traveling court jester in this movie, I almost thought he would burst into song somewhere in the film but I'm glad he didn't.  Overall, I felt this film failed to develop the characters to a respectable level and heavily relied on the battle scenes to carry it through, sad to say it could have been made better, if they had a good script to begin with.  If your interested in historical films about America and its wars in the 19th century I would recommend watching the Oscar winning film Glory."
"MrHen","2","1","7","13 April 2004"," Too long, drawn out, and nothing really happened.
","To be perfectly honest... I thought this movie was absolutely terrible. Nothing happened throughout the whole movie.  I went expecting to see a little bit of action but there was almost none.  I really only remember two fight scenes, one drawn out and terribily filmed with what looks like an attempt to make you feel for all that died in the Alamo, and one that lasted about 30 seconds which was actually done rather well, but it was a nice bit of film tacked on the end of two hours you would have to pay me to see again.<br/><br/>The first fight scene wouldn't have been so bad except they drew it out and I had just sat through 2 hours of drawing out.  It felt like more of a ""finally, they're all going to die so I can go home"" instead of the respect for the Alamo I should have been feeling.  The character development was pretty decent except for (can you guess what's coming yet?) it was too drawn out.  There was a good movie hidden within all the waiting, but the waiting was 85% of it.  That might have been on purpose to try and make you feel the wait that they were feeling in the Alamo, but whatever they tried to do with it they failed.<br/><br/>It has been a long time since I've seen a movie that I thought ""Oh seriously, when does this get over?""  Granted that I wasn't expecting to see the kind of movie I saw.  I was expecting more action.  But in retrospect, as I look at what it was now knowing what to expect, it still doesn't look any better.  There is nothing they did in this movie they couldn't accomplish in a well written essay on the Alamo other than one cool part with Crockett's fiddle.<br/><br/>All in all, unless you are getting dragged to go see it by your girlfriend or family, are a big Alamo buff, or like any of the cast, do yourself a favor and find a spot on the History channel about the Alamo.  It'll probably be more entertianing.  2/10"

Despite a winning production design by Michael Corenblith there really isn't anything else remarkable about this otherwise forgettable epic wanna-be. (Dir: John Lee Hancock)"
"dhobbes1","3","1","11","2 May 2007"," ""The Alamo"": handsome propaganda.
","""The Alamo"" yet again gives us history a la Hollywood. An excellently directed, wonderfully acted crock.<br/><br/>Tragic as the 1836 slaughter at the Alamo was, the defenders were not valiant patriots who nobly sacrificed themselves for a great cause. They were land grabbers making an opportunity of the Mexican revolt (sadly, the film makes little of the Mexican defenders at the Alamo, the only ones there fighting for independence). The dictator, Generalissimo Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana, wasn't trying to take Texas because Mexico wanted what didn't belong to it, he was determined to keep what was left of an expanse that once included not only Texas, but what would become Utah and Nevada. Dictator or not, he had a right to rage war against interlopers who were stealing incredibly valuable land from his nation. <br/><br/>Also overlooked in the filmmakers' biased account: Juan Seguin and the other Mexican defenders were double-crossed the first chance Texans got. Seguin survived the battle and led a company with Gen. Sam Houston as Houston defeated Santa Ana at San Jacinto. Seguin was subsequently back-stabbed as, in the aftermath of the revolution, towns began expelling all Mexicans. After Seguin went on to help defeat a Mexican expedition against San Antonio in 1842, Anglos who'd been his comrades-in-arms turned on him with trumped up charges of treason. Vigilantes drove him from the city where he was born and forced him to flee to, of all places, Mexico, where, needless to say, he didn't get a warm welcome. Kind of takes some of the hero-worship out of the whole affair. <br/><br/>For good measure, one of reason colonists were up in arms against Santa Ana in the first place was that he declared slavery illegal. When Jim Bowie and William Travis showed up at the Alamo to fight for liberty, each brought a slave along to wait on him. <br/><br/>The whole thing boils down to the infamous edict of Manifest Destiny. The movie, of course, steers clear of this aspect. Which is a lot to simply overlook. And it's too bad because Hancock made a beautiful film with a strong cast of Dennis Quaid, Billy Bob Thornton, Jason Patric and Patrick Wilson as Houston, David Crockett, Bowie and Travis. The performances are masterful, conveying such humanity that you find yourself thoroughly engrossed in these characters and their fate. As well, skilled actors Emilio Echevarra as Santa Ana and Jodi Molla as Seguin acquit themselves admirably (especially considering they are handed two-dimensional characters to portray). <br/><br/>The Alamo is a powerful film in the same way that director D. W. Griffith employed groundbreaking artistry to create the propagandist landmark, Birth of a Nation."
"dddmi7-1","1","1","11","29 May 2006"," Absurd attempt
","Jason Patric cast as Sam Bowie? OK, anyone care to support that choice? Is there anyone, any actor cast in this 2004 version that comes close to the outstanding cast of the 1960 version? The scope and landscape of the '60 film dwarfs this sad attempt at movie-making. Casting, script, direction, cinematography, score...all spar and actually add up to just shy of a sophomoric attempt at film-making. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't buy into this sad waste of film. There are so many historical inaccuracies and theatrical miscues, I momentarily thought Oliver Stone directed this as another in his series of revisionist history lessons. I'm just so glad I borrowed this from my local library and didn't shell out $4 at blockbuster for this travesty. If BB Thornton & D Quaid keep making fine films like this, they will certain assure themselves of never ever garnering an Oscar. How did Thornton go from a small role in a great film like Tombstone, to a starring role in this monster of a box-office flop?"
"antshmartika","1","1","14","23 July 2009"," Possibly the most hyper-sensationalized movie I have ever seen
","First of all, I am a Texan (a San Antonian, no less) and I was appalled by this movie. Usually I am not a stickler for historical accuracy, I like a little leeway in the story telling. Davy Crockett wasn't executed in front of Santa Anna after cursing his name and offering surrender. Crockett was most likely one of the first killed (he's defending a mere cedar post wall in the movie. Now why would Santa Anna not choose to attack that side? Conveniently allows Davy to be the last survivor). And Deaf ""Deef"" Smith? His name was Deaf because he couldn't hear out of one ear! That's just basic homework right there, but the entire cast and crew somehow failed to notice the incorrect pronunciation. Also, instead of including relevant, historical scenes to juxtapose the studio created battle scenes with amateur lighting and cheap pyrotechnics, the director, screenwriter, and producers chose to fill those moments with outlandishly hyper-sensationalized garbage. Sweeping emotional monologues (Sam Houston on his cocaine-fueled horse), to gory Indian war tales (Yeah, David Crockett ate potatoes cooked with the grease of an Indian's back. Gotta be true). This movie was overwritten and under-directed (thank you Entourage) and was merely a highly low-budget film pretending to be have a fatter wallet. Sometimes it just takes a little research and creativity. This movie has none."
"classicsoncall","7","0","1","4 October 2019"," ""As goes the Alamo, so goes Texas!""
","It's been quite some time since I've seen the 1960 movie of the same name, but my gut feel leads me to consider I liked that one better. It certainly had a more stellar cast in a head to head match-up, with John Wayne in the role of Davy Crockett, Richard Widmark as Jim Bowie, Laurence Harvey as Colonel William Travis, and Richard Boone portraying Sam Houston. John Wayne doubled as director for that film, and his treatment offered perhaps a bit more even handed direction that didn't overtly paint the Mexican Army as villains, even though their mission was to march directly through San Antonio in order to subdue the rest of Texas under the Mexican banner. In this picture, Santa Anna's (Emilio Echevarria) character is represented along the same lines as say, Adolph Hitler, caring very little for the humanity of his soldiers, while describing them as little chickens, in other words, quite expendable when it comes to doing battle. That attitude also extended to the opposition, declaring that no prisoners would be taken alive, thereby calling for a massacre of everyone inside the dilapidated confines of The Alamo itself.<br/><br/>Of the principals, Billy Bob Thornton probably acquits himself best as former frontiersman and Congressman, Davy Crockett. Preferring to be called David, there's a scene in which he's shown to display his amazing marksmanship by shooting an epaulet off the shoulder of Santa Anna. I doubt if that ever occurred, so a bit of poetic license there. Wracked with tuberculosis, back then known as consumption, Jim Bowie (Jason Patric) has very little to do in the story, though he was given a mission by Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) to retrieve the cannon from the Alamo, which had been the subject of rival ownership between Texas and Mexico. Because of Bowie's status, most of the soldiers deferred to Bowie regarding military matters instead of the actual commander in charge, and at a critical juncture, Bowie had to nod his assent for the orders of Lieutenant Colonel William Travis (Patrick Wilson) to be followed.<br/><br/>If memory serves, the battle scenes in the original movie were more remarkably staged, though both pictures present the Mexican Army as resplendent in their military uniforms. Where this picture took things a step further was the aftermath of the siege, whereby Sant Anna, remining convinced of his status as a Napoleon of the West, decided to engage an advance led by Sam Houston which was bent on avenging the losses at The Alamo. Patiently awaiting a tactical mistake by the Mexican general, Houston's rag tag soldiers decimated the enemy troops in a mere matter of eighteen minutes. Apparently, Santa Anna overlooked the all important fact that even Napoleon, at the height of his career, had met his Waterloo."

There wasn't anything I noticed that made me question the historical accuracy.

","On release it was met with disdain at worst, indifference at best, and now historically it stands as the second biggest box office failure. The pre-release word of mouth wasn't good, and with ""difficulties"" of the financial and creative kind leading to Ron Howard leaving the directors chair-and Russell Crowe and Ethan Hawke dishing out roles for two of the main characters, the film has never had an equal footing from which to try and sell itself as a worthy epic. Yet if there is a western styled war film most likely to improve with age, then Hancock's Alamo is it. You see, in time it's hoped that people can embrace that this take on the Alamo legend thrives on humanistic depth, telling it not as a ""hooray"" hero piece, but as it was, men doomed to die. And more pertinent, men who ""knew"" that in all probability, they were waiting for death to come. <br/><br/>Hancock should be roundly applauded for having the courage to craft such an honest depiction of the siege, and it's not as if we aren't warned about it, either in history as fact, or during the downbeat opening five minutes of film. So a film rich with in depth characterizations, then, but also a picture layered over with considerable technical skill. Hancock himself only really misfires by having a tacked on coda that shows Houston defeating Santa Anna and gaining his surrender. Who made the decision for this uplift I'm not sure, but it feels forced and doesn't have the impact intended. It would have been more telling and poignant to just have a title card flash up to tell us that Houston defeated Santa Ann in 18 minutes. We don't need to see a hurried recreation, the somber mood needed to be kept up right to the last end credit rolled. For that's the true pain of The Battle of the Alamo. In other words, if you're movie is more depressing than a funeral, don't try to cheer someone up with a 5-minute scene.<br/><br/>And now returning to the present day. As watching this from my ""US History through FIlm"" class, I think to myself, ""Should I feel guilty?"" I believe I shouldn't, but there's a constant voice in my mind asking me why not... how my American ancestors are responsible for making this happen. However, I then remind myself that I'm supposed to be an arrogant teenager, so I try to forget any problems that exist in our society. Anyway, I'm getting off track, so I'll return to the review. Although ""The Alamo"" has several flaws, it is still a movie worth the watch, and will help educate many individuals on the great, dire battle that lacked meaning in all ways. This movie: 7/10 The battle this movie is based on: 0.00001/10"

This movie is personally not my cup of tea, I was personally bored while watching it I do realizes that I will much rather watch a movie that isn't so serious and reading a page texture but rather a movie that is more open and mystical with the way the world and humanity is or at least one that will make me laugh."

","I am writing this review for my U.S. History through film class. The plot is that the Americans and the Mexicans are fighting for the land of Texas. I only watched half of this movie so this review might not be entirely accurate. But I liked the war and setting as well as the dialogue when it was used well. When it wasn't used well, I didn't really like the dialogue. So this movie is alright but it could be better so I'd like to see others like but a little better."
"bambamcohee","10","0","2","9 October 2018"," Great Historical Film
","I watched this movie to gain a better understanding of the Alamo. This was one of the best films to ever capture what it was like even with the limitations of the budget. The filmmaker is telling the story of the Alamo. What it was like to be at siege inside the fort. What it was like to endure constant attacks from the French and Mexican armies. Then to show that the war wasn't lost when the Alamo was. Pretty much everything gave it away that the movie was recently produced. It wasn't grainy at all and had great sound. The acting was really well done; just as the special effects were. Of course there's really know what to know exactly what happen because the winners always write history. However there's small things that may not seem to real. For example how Crockett stopped the Alamo from being fired upon one night because he played his violin in harmony with the French. This movie's time period is pretty far from the historical films I've watched so I can't make any connections. I enjoyed how accurate this was to the actual battle. I loved how it showed and explained that Huston took out Anna's army in 18 min. There wasn't anything i didn't like; you can't dislike something for being accurate. Overall this was an amazing movie with great actors and an awesome director. I found it interesting how they managed to capture it and have it be a good representation of the battle. I would like to see more movies with the same actors and director."

","This movie was awesome. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I started reading reviews before I write any and I must say, you guys make me sick. What did this movie ever do to get so many harsh, crass, cruel, barbarous, savage, etc. reviews. This movie was a good mix of history and Hollywood. I didn't know a ton about the history of the movie, but I definitely know more after seeing this movie than I did before. I don't understand why there are so many haters. All of you are haters! What gives? Do you really think someone is going to care that you don't think the movie was any good just because they don't like how certain characters were portrayed? It's time for all of you haters to get off your high horse because you don't like the acting. I don't understand what is wrong with you people.
 If you still think the movie was so bad you would tell your friend not to watch it, I hope you'll reconsider that choice. I can't believe what you guys are doing. You really think that I want to hear all the bad stuff you have to say about a movie that deserves 10+ stars? 
 Enough about how sickened I am with all the negativity around here. Now it's time for me to explain how I felt about the MOVIE.
 
 The movie was glorious. If you've read my review on ""The Crossing"" you'll understand that I have a dark sense of humor. If you haven't, well, now you know. I loved this movie. I watched it in class and I would definitely watch it again. I will say, if you have a weak stomach, it's not a good idea for you to watch it. There is a lot of stabbing and death in the movie. One guy gets stabbed a bunch of times towards the end even though he's lying in his deathbed. Do they really think he can do them a lot of harm? I mean, he does shoot at them and hits TWO of them and there were how many? All of the soldiers of Santa Anna's that got into that room stabbed him at least once. They must have been thinking, ""Well, he's already dead. Let's just make sure he stays dead."" What the freaking crap?!?! He's dead guys. You killed him. You can stop stabbing him now.
 Santa Anna's army had been shooting at the Alamo for a long time before he finally decided to attack them in the middle of the freaking night! What the freaking crap! I don't care that the Alamo are trying to take Texas away from you, why can't you leave the americans alone?! This movie isn't trying to paint a picture of how barbaric the army of Santa Anna was. If you know the history of the event, you know that the army of Santa Anna was full of barbarians. I hate the lot of them. Just add insult to injury, why don't you?
 The death of David Crockett was really sad, but his last words were pretty great, ""I must warn you, I'm a screamer."" 
 There were so many young men that didn't deserve to be massacred like that. All these boys wanted was freedom. They were fighting for their freedom and a lot of them were brutally massacred for it. Then Sam Houston's army shows up and defeats the army of Santa Anna in 18 minutes. Something that the people in the Alamo could only dream about. Maybe if Houston's army had arrived sooner, the Alamo may have been saved. Maybe."

"erichansen1836","10","0","2","21 June 2016"," Does History Repeat Herself? Or do various cultures adapt the same stories and make them their own?
","The Admiral - Roaring Currents (2014 film) about 12 ships against 330 ships (from Korean/Japanese history of 1597) is the same odds ratio basically as 180 men against 5000 men in, The Alamo (2004 film) from Mexican and Texas U.S. history.<br/><br/>There is nothing new under the sun according to the Bible author of the Book of Ecclesiastes.<br/><br/>In both films you have the head military leader coughing up blood into a napkin. The Admiral does so (The Admiral), and Colonel Bowie does so (The Alamo).<br/><br/>The Alamo writers use 180 Texan troops fighting against 5000 Mexican troops. Whereas, The Admiral writers use 12 Korean ships against 330 Japanese ships. That is almost exactly the same odds ratio. EXAMPLE: 12 ships times 10 = 120 ships. 330 ships times 10 = 3300 ships. add half as many more and you get 180 ships against 4950 ships (sounds like 180 men against 5000 men).<br/><br/>Either history repeats herself around the world or else these writers are deceiving us into thinking their plots are original?<br/><br/>Consider the Israelite story of Moses, King Saul, and King David. Then consider the Roman/Greek story of the Emperor Nero. Nero's life was very similar to the combined lives of Moses/Saul/David.<br/><br/>Davy Crockett's life can be compared to Jesus Christ in great detail. Davy was even purported to have risen from the dead and appeared to many in Mexico City after the fall of the Alamo (and his death). Davy bled the 5000 whereas Jesus fed the 5000. And so on.<br/><br/>And COL Jim Bowie, COL Davy Crockett, and LT COL William Travis are considered the Holy Trinity of the Alamo.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Admiral is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost all rolled up into one? Or should I add Moses too, making 4? We have to add in General Sam Houston into the mix to make a victory for the Texans. So perhaps the Admiral is: Moses, God, Jesus, Holy Spirit all rolled up into one, or Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, William Travis, and Sam Houston all rolled up into one?"
"SnoopyStyle","6","0","1","2 September 2015"," the action is good
","In 1835, Sam Houston (Dennis Quaid) tries to rally people to Texas. William Barret Travis (Patrick Wilson) is given command of the Alamo. He faces Santa Anna with a smaller force even with the arrival of ex-congressman David Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton) and other volunteers. The movie continues after the Alamo and ends with Santa Anna's defeat at the Battle of San Jacinto.<br/><br/>There is a mass of historical characters being gathered here. It would probably help to center the movie on one non-historical character. There are too many characters that need their 15 minutes. There are some good action scenes but the movie is too old fashion to be compelling as a modern film."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","0","3","3 May 2013"," Not much worth remembering
","As the Mexicans sends an army of thousands to take back Texas(which was rightfully theirs), The Alamo becomes one of the main battlegrounds, in spite of being difficult to defend and possessing too few troops - the Americans simply didn't think there was much of a risk. We focus on general Houston(Quaid, a smart, if at times overly aggressive, commander) who some consider obsessed, Bowie(Patric, doing much better than in Speed 2, the only other thing I've seen him in... a man resigned to his terminally ill state, who still won't stand for just anything), Travis(Wilson, a man who has to prove that he isn't just a pampered rich kid) and Crockett(Thornton, stealing the film - having a complicated relationship with the mythical status he enjoys).<br/><br/>There are some positives to this. Every major character is a human being, no one is a cardboard cutout, and our protagonists are not flawless. We have themes of legend vs. reality, ambition vs. Family and lower class vs. educated. We can understand both sides, and this does admit some gruesome things the Americans did(and in general there are a ton of little details that feel real, and are there purely for that, whether they reflect well on ""our guys"" or not). When Spanish should be spoken, it is, and convincingly so. The production design is good, with high authenticity.<br/><br/>It's apparently the most(I haven't watched the others) historically accurate account, however, it is also Disney-fied. There is Little tension, the actual battle comes in late and is short(and violence tends to be implied). It's talky, and comes off as a made-for-TV piece, not reaching the levels of epic that it's clearly going for. There is no one vision shining through, and we're left wondering what to feel. As such, the 2 hour, 3 minute running time sans credits(or 2 hours and 11 minutes with) at times really snail-paces by.<br/><br/>The DVD comes with an English Audio descriptive language track, the featurette Return of the Legend: The Making of The Alamo(18 minutes long; I will review this on its own separate page here on the site), 5 minutes of fine deleted scenes(with optional director's commentary), a 4 and a half minute decent Set Tour and a King Arthur trailer. I recommend this only to those easily roused, and those looking for a summary of what happened in the form of a film. 6/10"
"deanix","8","0","1","24 June 2011"," Shame about the timing
","I thought this was a very well-made movie. The characters were believable and the action was historically viable. Lovely camera work too. I had avoided seeing it on account of the negative reaction on its release, but when I read some of the reviews here I decided to seek it out. Didn't have to wait long - it was on our local cable channel in the wee small hours. I was enthralled from start to finish. Maybe it got poor reviews in 2004 because it was about Texas (GW Bush's state) or maybe because it was a Disney movie. Watched it tonight on VHS. I will watch it again several times and eventually buy the DVD. John Wayne's 1960 version is a good show too(though not historically accurate), but but the Director's Cut is not available on DVD. The short version is poor in comparison, IMHO."
"robaustin","6","0","3","1 January 2005"," Hisorical truth didn't have to be boring
","At this moment in American history, with the government trying to slap on a heroic - if not happy face on a monstrous foreign policy, the idea of setting the record straight about the American past has appeal. We've been fed so many lies about our own history that when we see the truth, there's a built in shock value that should give the film a lift. And the facts could have made 'The Alamo' a good film. All it needed was a better script and tighter direction. It didn't have to be boring. And had it been better, other film makers might have been encouraged to take on other myths. How about a portrayal of Jesse James, serial killer - rather than a misunderstood Henry Fonda? The western is particularly fertile ground for remedial drama. But so are the stories of Bonnie and Clyde, The Sands of Iwo Jima, The Titanic - the list is long. And these subjects would work especially well in the hands of a number of directors with today's deeper, braver sensibilities. Opportunity missed. That's my verdict."
"interest-4","3","0","3","29 December 2004"," Good Entertainment
","The 2004 version of John Lee Hancock's Alamo may not have been historically accurate by any means, but it was Hollywood to the letter. I found Gerneral Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna one of the most interesting characters in the film, his lines did him justice. I do not want to take away Thornton's Crockett performance, it did give the viewer an inside look into a man who really did not want to be in the situation he found himself in - and in real life, Crockett was a man looking for the next vote, not the next fight. From the start I knew the movie was going to take a ""Hollywood"" turn, as history can be very boring to some, as being completely historically accurate would have flopped worse than it did. But if each viewer can watch it as entertainment verses true to life facts, I am sure they would be entertained. The battle of San Jacinto at the end did not do the actual battle justice, as it made Sam Houston appear to be a super hero leading his army to total victory. The Mexican army was not caught by surprise, as in real life, and the small skirmishes at the beginning were left out. The film also attempts to portray the Tejano rebels (Juan Seguin and his men) as being in total awe at the carnage carried out during the battle, when actually, the Tejano soldiers were some of the most brutal on the field. The movie gets my vote for entertainment at the very least. I rank it above John Wayne's 1960 version by a long shot - as Wayne merely fed the myth that has caused so much hatred and distrust over the years since the actual battle. If you can get over the alter ego persona of Houston, Bowie (especially Bowie), and Travis, I think you will enjoy the film. 3 out of 5 stars."

","his coughing was a little over the top, too. i think he was first timer at that. he was an awesome actor, its just his role that annoyed me, sometimes. whipping out the ""knife"" scenes were annoying, too one time was enough. that girl he kept having flashbacks about was really getting on my nerves. I mean, there was no meaning for that and it just took up too much time. And why did the girl have to be so ugly? god, she looked like one of those ""homeless/ need extreme makeover"" people.I mean, at least use a pretty woman, gosh! and did they have to be so graphic on his death? I'm not a fan of blood. they had to have the sound effects and everything even slicing the guy! I like the music though. it went well with that scene. the scene where travis makes his speech makes me angry because I had to study travis and it says he drew a line in the dirt after he said: ""and if any of you wish to depart you may do so now"" and then he draws a line in the dirt and TWO people are supposed to cross the line. (means they chose to depart.) that just makes me angry, that they forgot such a great part that travis does. and i don't remember reading about a little boy or girl either, all i read was about the pregnant wife. the thing that makes me laugh in this movie is how travis and bowie are always fighting, but then they eventually make up. They are like brothers in this movie, fighting and eventually making up. i really like the part where travis comes in to talk to bowie and says: (after the speech stuff)""How'd you like them?""(the words of the speech) bowie:""good words, good words."" (travis then offers bowie a way out)bowie replies with my favorite line: "" I deserve no mercy, but I do deserve a drink. Have anything stronger then water?"" travis says all his crap about things he'd do rather then drink and then says:""I'll see if I can fetch you a bottle"" and runs of to fight and yada, yada.thats what i'm talking about when i say ""brotherly relations."" its so touching! this is a movie i highly recommend you to see it is amazingly done, and its something I would watch over and over again. (which i do by the way.)i rate this movie an 8.5 out of ten and I hope you enjoy it because I did. the way i saw was we watched in history class which made me fall in love with it."

","I understand that Russel Crowe was originally signed to do this picture. When it started going over budget, the Director was fired. A new director was hired and attempted to salvage the remainder of the movie with severe budget restraints. The outcome was Dennis Quaid doing a very sour performance of Sam Houston and a movie that was noticeably lacking in continuity and poor performances. The cast was lacking in name recognition.<br/><br/>There was also much evidence of poor editing and rewrites. <br/><br/>Historical accuracy also suffered.

"TheMovieMark","Null","0","3","14 June 2004"," Not what it could've been
","""The Alamo"" is a good, not great, movie. It didn't have quite the emotional impact on me that I hoped it would. My better half, Stephanie, is from Texas, and she felt the same way. There just seems to be something about the pacing that doesn't flow as smoothly as I would've liked. I never truly got the feeling that the Alamo defenders had been inside the walls for 13 days, and the movie could've done a better job of showing the reasons why these men were willing to die behind the walls of an old, abandoned church.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, there are some historical inaccuracies. For one, I really doubt Davy Crockett played the fiddle along with the Mexican Army's band while standing atop the Alamo. It's a funny scene though. Also, historical accounts state that Crockett died while fighting. ""The Alamo"" portrays him as being captured and then killed. Don't worry, the movie doesn't get so politically correct as to have him beg for his life or anything. I was scared of that, but thankfully, he died bravely.<br/><br/>The biggest omission in the movie is William Barrett Travis drawing a line in the sand with his sword and asking those who are willing to die to cross over the line. All but one man crossed the line. A sick Jim Bowie, legend says, even had his cot carried across the line. The only man not to cross the line was Louis Rose, a French man who'd served in Napoleon's army. Wow, a French man was the one man not willing to fight? Surprise, surprise! Anyway, Rose escaped with his life and told the story.<br/><br/>In the movie, Travis does say that anybody who doesn't want to fight can leave, but the scene is not as powerful as it could've been had they gone with the ""line in the sand"" story. Why was this left out? I don't know, but it is most unfortunate.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""The Alamo,"" especially when the fighting started. I'm just disappointed that it didn't leave me feeling as charged up and patriotic as something like Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot."" If you have no interest or knowledge in the history of the Alamo, then I fear that this movie will not give you a satisfactory reason as to why so many men were willing to die, and you might find yourself asking why *you* should be willing to invest your interest in the movie."
"floridawar","Null","0","1","14 April 2004"," History Not Artistry
","I enjoyed this movie a great deal, although it definitely reinforces the case that historical accuracy alone does not make a great movie. I concur with many of the previously posted criticisms regarding this movie as ART, but got a kick out of a few elements of it that I noticed. Among the actors who appear in this version of the Alamo were two who appeared in the last major retelling; 1987s ""The Alamo; Thirteen Days to Glory:"" Tom Everett and Buck Taylor. Also, regarding historical accuracy, a portion of the lost garrison were ""New Orleans Grays,"" volunteers for Texas from Louisiana who wore grey uniforms. I enjoyed seeing them depicted among the motley militia etc. of the garrison. On that score, many of my friends were confused by the references to Travis commanding the ""regulars"" and Bowie the ""volunteers."" This was not a reference to the United States Army, But to the ARmy of the Republic of Texas, which included a core group of enlisted regulars (who did recieve uniforms after the republic was established), and volunteers, who were to serve only in wartime; in effect embodied Texian militiamen. These were supplemented by numerous independent companies of Volunteers from the United States, (like the Grays) who went to Texas to join the fray. Among Houston's army at San Jacinto were depicted a number of US Army ""deserters"" in the sky blue jackets and trousers, who are understood to have joined the Texan Army (with or without official permission is debateable.) The Two scenes that stand out in my mind were all to brief: The scene where the Grays are bayonetted to death in their barracks room was chilling and evocative in a way I have not seen in previous cinematic versions; Second, Crockett's execution, with the mixture of bemusement and rancor evident in the Mexicans. As I understand it is now pretty much accepted fact among historians that C. was executed, but by Santa Anna's staff officers in order to please their leader.In fact, I found myself more interested in the Mexican scenes than the rambling between the Texian principals. I appreciated the redemption theme of the film among the Alamo leaders, but after a few dialogues it was redundant, and I longed for more concentration on Billy Bob's Crockett and Echevarria's Santa Anna."

","then this is the movie for you. Just because there are hardly any serious action scenes in the first 90 minutes of the movie doesn't mean the pace had to be so slow. Except for David (as he preferred) Crockett, the main characters are presented as angels with dirty faces and alcoholics with hearts of gold. They all glower and mumble like Brando. The only exciting characters and riveting actors were Billy Bob Thornton (Crockett) and Echevarria as the deliciously evil General Santa Ana.<br/><br/>I've heard that the film has been re-edited several times in response to negative audience reactions at test screenings. The advance screening audience I was with last night (who saw it for free) not only did not applaud, someone gave the movie a well-deserved boo.<br/><br/>It still needs editing. The spectacular battle scenes could have been presented earlier, with the slow bits shown as flashbacks. I felt like I was sitting through a dry history lesson. ""The Alamo"" comes across as a Ken Burns documentary, but less exciting."
