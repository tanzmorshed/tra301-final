"Imme-van-Gorp","7","102","123","30 January 2019"," Unfortunately the ending ruined an otherwise great film.
","This movie is full of suspense. It makes you guess about what is real and what is not. It happens more than once that you have to wonder about what is the truth and who is lying.<br/><br/>Because you are just as clueless as the main character, Michelle, you really get to experience the same type of emotions and confusion as she is. This not only makes you feel closer to Michelle as a character, but also to the overall story.<br/><br/>They did, however, ruin this connection that they build over the course of the story by making this sloppy, rushed and just strange ending. If they had made a different ending, my rating could have been an 8 or maybe even a 9. Depends on how good of an ending it would have been."
"sonofocelot-1","5","385","500","10 May 2016"," ...oh dear Abrams. Again.
","I'll leave this review fairly concise. <br/><br/>This film was originally called ""the cellar"" the premise being what we see for the first 90% of ""10 cloverfield lane"": an excellent, brilliantly-scripted thriller set in an underground bunker, the tension lying in the ""goodie-or-baddie"" mystery that is the owner of the bunker, Howard. He is telling our hero, Michelle, that she cannot leave because the air outside is not breathable due to an attack, probably nuclear. She wants to leave because she suspects that Howard is insane.<br/><br/>That premise right there is perfect. Is Howard telling the truth? Is he a deranged kidnapper? Will Michelle eventually decide to leave? Is the air really breathable outside? The magnitude of that intrigue would have made for a brilliant film. <br/><br/>Would have.<br/><br/>This is when JJ Abrams and bad robot came in and basically did what they do with the end of every single project they ever take on. Ruin it. Ruin it absolutely horrifically. They have clearly seen monetary value in the name ""cloverfield"" and are insisting on making it a franchise. Do we expect monsters going into this film? Yes. Do we get them? Yes. Was it necessary? Absolutely one million percent no. <br/><br/>10 minutes from the end of what had been a gripping film, we finally see Michelle leave, and escape the bunker. She realises that the air is still breathable. Now, ""pre-abrams"" as I'll refer to it, this would've been an excellent ending. A bittersweet tale of abuse, of loneliness from Howard's point of view, of revenge, of victory. But with a huge psychological trauma to go home with. Honestly this film would be perfect had it ended here. But it wasn't to be.<br/><br/>This is when the aliens come. We seem to in the blink of an eye turn from ""the cellar"", a brilliantly told thriller, into an Abrams, overly-Hollywood, big budget cringefest. For me, it wasn't the moment the spaceship came on the screen, it was the moment our timid hero, portrayed brilliantly up until now, who'd just been crying uncontrollably with relief at the air still being breathable, suddenly turns stern action hero. She looks up and says ""you have GOT to be kidding me"", in the same emphatic way we've seen in 600 ""five out of ten"" films down the years. <br/><br/>I'm sorry, but you've just seen alien life. And that's your reaction? In what until now was a very realistic, well told suspense thriller? Not having it for a second. It was like we could see the moment Abrams took over. And it ruined what could have been a classic.<br/><br/>The remaining 9 minutes are nothing more than a glorified creature feature, culminating in our hero, who's suddenly lost all her emotions, driving off to help the ""human resistance"" fight against the aliens.<br/><br/>End of movie. What amazes me most is the number of critic reviews I've seen saying ""the aliens are a metaphor for what is outside a person's lonely bubble of abuse"" or some nonsense along those lines. Sorry guys but you're thinking WAY too much into it. This is a story of a money-grabbing company, who bought a perfectly good script, and ruined the ending with aliens. <br/><br/>I'm not entirely sure what I expected in all honesty. It's Abrams. I saw the ending to LOST and vowed never to make the mistake of investing my time in any of his projects again. Sure enough, I made the aforementioned mistake again and it's almost as bad as LOST was (minus the 5 years of my life id invested for the lovey-dovey, semi-religious, out-of- ideas cop out snoozefest that was the ending to LOST). <br/><br/>Abrams strikes me as one of those who inexplicably takes pride in disappointing his audiences, as if he feels he's somehow above them and that the negative reviews are just people who don't ""get"" him. I think in all honesty it's more a sign that he's just not very good at what he does. <br/><br/>My advice? Turn off when you see Michelle remove her oxygen mask. Pretend that's the end and you have your film of the year. Watch on for yet another example of ""how to ruin a perfectly decent project: by JJ Abrams""<br/><br/>5/10. 10 for the first hour and a half, minus 5 for the last 10 minutes."
"mhodaee","5","110","143","4 August 2017"," Fantastic, gripping, thoroughly enjoyable, until the final part ruins it...
","I give the 5/10 out of the credit I owe to the original writers of the fascinating psychological horror that takes place inside the bunker. The mystery is compelling: Is Howard telling the truth? Is there any real threat outside? Is Howard a crazy child-abusing maniac? Did he plan all this to own Michelle? etc. I could all go on pretty well had the film ended with the heroine's escape, but then, all of a sudden, what the? REAL ALIENS? Are you kidding me? Just how ""lost"" are you Mr. Abrams?! You turned the fantastic, gripping thriller about a deranged paranoid old man into a totally irrelevant tale of worm aliens taking over the earth? The ending ruins everything. The character of Michelle was well portrayed as a woman running away from problems instead of facing them, finally managing to ""grow up"" and learn to fight her problems. The ending, however, turns her into a completely different person. From a timid girlfriend, Michelle turns into an alien- smacking badass chick straight out of a classic sci-fi alien flick who blows up a giant alien invader with a bottle of liquor and a matchbox and, not frightened in the least, decides to take the fight to the aliens herself. The movie begins and proceeds as a psychological thriller/drama about paranoia, claustrophobia, and insanity and in a split second turns into the worst moments of the Resident Evil franchise. I literally thought I was watching a remake of the ending of The Thing, with the same actress and all. Great job uncle J.J., you did it again. Had I know he was involved in the plot, I would've thought twice before watching this film. You CAN enjoy this film, just turn if off as soon as the hero goes free. keep watching and it'll turn all the fun you had into utter disappointment, frustration, and resentment."
"fil-nik09","5","73","100","5 October 2016"," Hmmm...
","First of all, I must say that I was expecting 'something different' considering the 7.3 note here! Something really worth of that note, but this is not that great!<br/><br/>As many have pointed out, this film has a problem with ending. I would have ended the film when she sees the birds flying. But that alien / mars attacks ending was just totally out of the blue. Totally not connecting with the film ( though I admit it proves the story that something bad had happened). I mean... even if they really wanted the alien ending, it could have been more subtle. This was like you added a totally different movie to the one you are doing.<br/><br/>Good point is that you really DO NOT know if the guy who held the girl in the basement is good or bad. We do not know if he killed anyone before he took the life of the guy in the basement. Everything is up to you to decide. All in all, he is actually a good guy from what we were seeing up to the point when he shot the guy ( but only when he said he would take his gun).<br/><br/>All in all, this maybe could have a better note if it wasn't for such laughable ending. I did not like it.<br/><br/>5 from me."
"DVR_Brale","7","42","56","27 July 2016"," Slow building & plot alternating claustrophobic bunker movie with a sloppy ending
","I've always loved movies with strong atmosphere. Three people locked together in an underground shelter is a recipe for making a movie which is going to draw you in a rather small but peculiar world.<br/><br/>This is one if the rare non-crime movies that keep you guessing what might have happened and what's happening. No where does the plot release it's vents but on contrary it keeps building pressure.<br/><br/>There are little if any horror elements in this movie. Those of you who want to get scared are not going to be content. Those of you looking for a tense, slow building atmosphere are going to love this one! This is primarily a mystery movie.<br/><br/>John Goodman has done such a good job that he even succeeded in making me nervous like I was locked with him. There's nothing really strange about Howard. The conditions are guilty for making him looking wicked. Or are they?<br/><br/>While the main premise has been greatly utilized I don't think ending was sound or in some way contributory to a plot. It's as if writers didn't know how to leave some space open for a sequel. <br/><br/>You can enjoy this movie equally well watching it by yourself or with somebody else. Go and see it."
"jesussanchezfdez","9","242","371","11 March 2016"," Powerful and shocking mystery
","10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.<br/><br/>First of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan movies would lose all interest.<br/><br/>I was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and surprising finale. The direction is amazing and claustrophobic. The performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman. The story is gleefully unapologetic delivering chills and full blooded twists (the biggest of all is the intense ending reveal) even thought it deviates from the monster POV storyline.<br/><br/>Secretly made, impeccably marketed, nicely developed and finally here along with us: 10 Cloverfield Lane promised thrills and delivered it and then some. I was expecting some things that I tasted but I was surprised by a complexity and a twisted sense of horror that I didn't see coming. 2016 has released the very first great movie of the year."
"brands42","9","278","431","9 March 2016"," 10 Cloverfield Lane
","Two months ago, no one knew that 10 Cloverfield existed, let alone was about to be wide released in theaters. One month ago, no one had any idea how, if at all, this film was related to the 2008 film Cloverfield except for the obvious title and produced J.J. Abrams. And now, all is revealed. Sort of. Here's my review.<br/><br/>One of the greatest things 10 Cloverfield Lane has to offer is that the audience really has no idea what to expect going into the film. Very much in the J.J Abrams way, the production for this film has been left completely under-wraps and the trailers have revealed next to nothing. That's one of the benefits for the movies, so I'm not going to spoil or give anything away in my synopsis or the review. I won't even tell you if this movie is indeed a Cloverfield sequel or if it's something different altogether. You'll have to find out for yourself, because I can tell you right now that you should spend the money to go see it in theaters.<br/><br/>I'll be brief. A woman we know very little about named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a car crash in a breath taking opening credit sequence. She wakes up a few days later to find herself in an underground bunker with Howard (John Goodman), a large and crazed eyed farmer standing above her. He tells her that she can't leave, because some sort of disaster has happened and it's not safe to go outside. Finding herself alone with Howard and another man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), and I'm stealing their tag line here because it's a dang good tag line, they find out that Monsters come in many forms.<br/><br/>Obviously I had no idea to expect when I went into 10 Cloverfield Lane. No one did. But within the first five minutes they set the tone so you know what kind of movie they are going for, and I found myself instantly engaged. For the rest of the film, I was floored with what was going on. Director Dan Trachtenberg takes the reigns on creating a film that will hit you with the unexpected, and leave your jaw hanging.<br/><br/>The best word I could think of to describe this film while I was watching it was claustrophobic. For the scenes that takes place in the bunker (I'm not saying how much of the screen time that actually is) they create such an intense and nervous atmosphere that you feel yourself getting antsy along with the characters. <br/><br/>That's because for almost the whole film, we don't really know what's going on. We know what John Goodman is telling us and leading us to believe, but we have no idea if that's reliable or not. We discover things along with the characters, which is why this film is such a good build up. When the conclusion to the film finally comes, you leave more than satisfied. But don't ruin it for yourself by looking up online spoilers to see if it is a Cloverfield sequel. Spend the money. See the movie. Find out for yourself. It's worth it.<br/><br/>I've heard the argument and I've sited it a few times in past reviews, that the best way to bring out great performances in actors is to lock them in a single setting film where they having nothing to hide their performance behind. That's what happens here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, an actress who deserves to get more work than she does, played the character so well as she captures the nervous ticks without acting completely helpless the whole time. In the end, she was pretty bad-ass. John Gallagher Jr., a character who could have been super annoying, ended up being great in the film too, and had really good chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead.<br/><br/>But the stand-out of the film if John Goodman. John Goodman is in so many films every year that we sometimes take him for granted and forget how good of an actor he can be when he's not mailing it in (whatever Hangover film he was in. I forget) but rather commits whole heartedly to a role. That's what happens here. He could have easily over-cooked his performance where it came of as cartoon-y or unrealistic, but he hit just the right level of disturbing and off-putting where you are crept out by the guy but you can't be sure if he's in the right or wrong. It's a performance similar to Joel Edgerton's in The Gift.<br/><br/>ALSO just read on IMDb that Bradely Cooper's voice appeared over a cell-phone in one scene. I knew I had heard the voice somewhere but I couldn't put my finger on it until now.<br/><br/>At no point of 10 Cloverfield Lane does the film slow down or lose interest. It uses it's hour and forty five minute runtime, a surprisingly long one for this type of film, to achieve the best possible effects. The film flies by and I found myself never wanting it to be over. <br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie you should rush out to the theater to go see. Accept that you know nothing about it going in, and enjoy that experience. Because it's something that doesn't happen often and it's a rare gift when it does. 10 Cloverfield Lane has a lot to offer despite the fact that it's a very small film. In fact, regardless of the fact if they are in the same universe, I'll say I enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane more than I enjoyed Cloverfield itself. And I want to see the story continued in a sequel. 10 Cloverfield Lane gets an A-, it's one of my favorite films of 2016 so far. Go see it this weekend. "" - brands42"
"sipanu_alin","8","32","44","16 June 2016"," Annoyed by people who expect alien holocaust in this movie
","First of all, the film was more than good, in my opinion and, for the people who like to see a good or more than good movie, I recommend buying a ticket or the DVD release or just rent it. As a medium spoiler, I'd say that, plot wise, it reminded me of ""Law abiding citizen"", with the first three quarters of the movie full of suspense and plot twists, and the last act, a little rushed and over the top. And that justifies the two penalty points I gave to this movie, one of them just for the exaggerated use of a bottle of good brandy.<br/><br/>As for ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", I can say it offered just the things you would expect... from a movie you really don't know what to expect. A thin trailer, with little to no information about the plot was, in my opinion, was a clever move and made me watch it. And, to be honest, except for the final act, I was more than satisfied with the emotion, the tension, the acting (great for two of the main characters, kinda OK for the other one), the way the director played with my mind and feelings about the characters and the way it builds them. You expect them to be capable of doing the things they do in the movie. For once, a complete looser at the beginning of the movie doesn't become, inexplicably and over night, some kind of Macgyver/guerrilla fighter at the end. It's a movie you can't forget really easy.<br/><br/>Now, for the part that I'm quite annoyed with: the alien mayhem expectations that make this movie ""baaad""...<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of reviews and opinions about how bad this movie is, about how much of a mixed up plot nonsense is and about the fact that most of them where ""waiting for something to happen"". Well, as I mentioned before, a lot of things happen, just not the ones you would expect. And, as I've seen, the upset and disappointed moviegoers were, mostly, the ones that expected to see a sequel for Cloverfield. Well (spoiler alert) IT'S NOT! It's a movie that tells a story happening during the events of Cloverfield and that is the only connection to the original. It can be taken as a standalone film, for that matter. And, as I said, a quite good one.<br/><br/>In conclusion: if you expect monster aliens fighting military helis, explosions, guns and all that Michael Bay stuff, then skip this one. On the other hand, if you expect a good thriller (with some added Sci- Fi at the end), good acting and disturbing plot twists, then it's the kind of movie for you.<br/><br/>P.S.: I'm not saying anything about the plot, because, just as one reviewer said, ""the more you know about the movie, the less interesting it will be""."
"NonSequiturL","8","165","258","9 March 2016"," Great claustrophobic story with fine performances... and a twist
","Full disclosure: The year is 2007. A trailer hits cinema screens advertising a mysterious film named ""Cloverfield."" Nobody knows what it's about, except that it's riding on the wave of the found footage genre, and that it seems to depict a giant monster attack on New York. Speculation immediately breaks out all over the internet, but nowhere more fiercely than on the IMDb forums, with many folks being caught up in the genius viral marketing. I myself was one of those people, along with my wife. Yes, we met on IMDb's Cloverfield forum. She moved from the US to Australia a few years after, we got married, and we've lived together happily ever since.<br/><br/>Yes, that is the power of film; it can bring people together in the most unlikely ways possible.<br/><br/>So, it's with some excitement that we were blindsided by the brief and vague advertising campaign for 10 Cloverfield Lane. Does it have any connections to the original Cloverfield? What's JJ Abrams playing at here, exactly? Without giving too much away, it's not a direct sequel, but rather a sequel in tone. I'm assuming Abrams is going for an anthology style series here, with each entry being a different story tied together by their themes and science-fiction setting. It's clearly a marketing thing, but if that means we'll get more films like this, I'm certainly okay with it.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane eschews its predecessor's found-footage trappings, and immerses us in a classic style bottle thriller. The setting is limited and claustrophobic, and the cast small, but the story and tension will grab you and not let up until the end. The nature of the mystery means your opinion will hang very precariously on whether you like that ending, and I suspect it will be divisive. There's not a great deal of resolution, and if I'm correct in assuming this will be an anthology series from now on, I doubt we'll ever get any. But that's fine, because I don't think the story that would follow the film really needs to be told.<br/><br/>What matters are the performances. John Goodman is the real draw card here. He gives a stunning turn that is delightful, sympathetic and absolutely terrifying in equal doses. He's had so many great roles in the past, but he is unforgettable here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also very likable as the resourceful protagonist. Perhaps a little too resourceful at times, but for the most part we're with her happily throughout.<br/><br/>The film looks fantastic despite the cramped environs, with great use of color and shadow and some interesting cinematography. There are some nice designs and special effects toward the end of the film, even if they may be considered a little derivative. The score is tense and effective, and keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The script is great with very little flab, and if you like these kinds of stories which lock characters together in tight, paranoid spaces then you'll find a lot to enjoy here. Just don't go in expecting Cloverfield 2, because this is not it. It's its own beast, and has a brave ending that you'll either love or hate."

I have to say, it's hard to tell if the greatness of this movie is going to hold up in 10 years because of how everything surrounding the movie made it better, but I really really liked it.<br/><br/>Me and my friend tried to avoid the spoilers on the internet and read as less as possible on the movie before we went to see it. Fortunately, the brilliant marketing campaign did not reveal anything about the story, and the fact that it was a sequel to 'Cloverfield' is going to make you constantly guess. Is it a traditional horror/suspense movie? Is it a monster movie? Where are the monsters? WHAT IS GOING? (Pretty much what I kept asking myself all along the movie)<br/><br/>John Goodman was incredible, definitely the standout of this movie. The soundtrack was great, some jukebox oldies and a thrilling score.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) driving off from her marriage and taking the road to leave her husband. This is made with a perfect montage, and there's no dialogue for the first 4-5 minutes of the movie. Then, things take a turn and we are transported to the bunker you saw in the trailers.<br/><br/>I will say it again, go watch this film, and don't read anything about it on the internet. I can't recall the last time a movie kept me guessing like this one. If you tend to get bored and tired by the usual clichés in movies, buy your ticket to '10 Cloverfield Lane' and enjoy your time at the movies.<br/><br/>Clever marketing, brilliant story, very good direction, great performance by the cast, it's hard to complain about this film!<br/><br/>9/10"

Even when it succumbs to the action and polemic moves, it will leave you on a grim and high note, pestering for another outing if it's any good like this.<br/><br/>If the ""Cloverfield"" that started it all was about speaking without breath and CGI scares, this ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is about deeper intentions, deeper tension and personal stuff that is scarier than a giant monster. While the connection to that movie is not so remarkable until the finale, this installment is so brilliant on its own, so well marketed (without ruining any twist) and so well ended that will surely please any viewer who were looking for a damn good movie.

Even more rare is when a movie like that delivers a wholly original story that's even more satisfying than you ever thought it would be.<br/><br/>'10 Clover-field Lane' is a perfect reminder that films can still surprise us, delight us, and horrify us in a way that's never been done before. Mark my words, Dan Trachtenberg will be a force to be reckoned with in the future. His feature length directorial debut is a showcase for his absolute confidence and strength as a storyteller and filmmaker, and I can't wait to see what he does next.<br/><br/>Of course, it always helps to have the likes of J.

Speaking of bad dreams, John Goodman turns in a performance unlike anything he's ever done before, and manages to be both strangely sweet and unbearably creepy. And John Gallagher, Jr. nails his roll perfectly and adds some much needed levity to a story that's almost overwhelmingly claustrophobic.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about what film I could use to compare '10 Clover-field Lane' to, and while I think even a comparison to a specific film might give too much away, I feel safe in saying that it is absolutely Hitchcock.

","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)<br/><br/>This is a tricky movie to review because it tries to do three different things, and it does two of them well. It's a movie that gets so much better as it goes, you hate the manipulative first twenty minutes more and more. <br/><br/>The problem is worse because I don't want to give away the plot. There are a few key twists that are part of what makes the movie special. The last section, which I can't outline a bit, is by far the best part, and it isn't given time to develop. Oddly, the last part is also preposterous, and the main character survives against all logic, and the first sections of the film strive for true fictional accuracy.<br/><br/>So, ultimately, the point of the film is to surprise and surprise. What really bothered me was the way the first section, where the leading woman is help captive (you learn this right away), tries to mislead us in a sensational way that doesn't make sense with the main central part of the film. <br/><br/>John Goodman, the big name here, plays a survivalist who is portrayed as a good guy with a mixed up sense of justice (and some personal loose screws). He's pretty good, though doesn't command the role quite the way he does some others in his career. The shelter he's created is elaborate, and the crisis outside the shelter is kept ambiguous— and doubtful—which is a great bit of suspense. <br/><br/>The final section almost seems to suggest a sequel—one that would be utterly different than this film.

The girl finally escapes the bunker (she was originally forced into it) just to find out most of the Earth is taken over by aliens and the best part, she was able to destroy one alien ship with a bottle of liquor. For a girl who runs away from one sign of problems, she did pretty good with an alien chasing her and a ship carrying her in a car in the air. Like what?<br/><br/>I can't anymore. I just can't.<br/><br/>Why can't I vote 0 stars?"

","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a superior example of the kind of story that would have made it into a half an hour on a show like ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits"". For some reason most horror/sci-fi movies these days have that feeling, like what you're seeing would have been far more effective at a shorter run time, and the idea doesn't really sustain a feature length.<br/><br/>I guess kids today, who didn't grow up with shows like that, may not have the same impression.<br/><br/>The story is interesting enough, and is largely held together by the unsettling performance of John Goodman. The ending is also a show stopper, though the movie has some padding on the way there that may make your interest wane."

","Goodman plays Howard, a paranoid psychopath and the proprietor of a large underground hideout, built for the occasion. In said hideout, he plays house to two co-dwellers: a bearded moron (John Gallagher Jr) and an attractive young lady played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Is there really a threat outside, will Howard behave himself? The problem is, after 20 minutes of tedious scenario and bland characters, who really cares?<br/><br/>The film never picks up any speed, sports no subplots, feels like it could go anywhere without sticking to any internal logic (which indeed it doesn't) and merely serves hollow and underused characters. <br/><br/>It's obvious the writers of this project wanted to fuse two genres of film but ended up having half the audience wet their pants over the ridiculous ending in which an alien spacecraft is destroyed by a bottle of Single Malt and the other half of the audience so abashed, they dare not admit they just wasted 2 hours of their lives."
"CineMuseFilms","4","22","34","16 March 2016"," The ending transforms this film into an incoherent and unforgivable mess.
","Many movie lovers will leave this film with a dilemma swirling in their mind: can a poorly conceived and poorly directed ending be ignored while you hang on to the memory of the brilliant film that almost was? In cinema, the answer is usually no because we remember a film backwards via the way the story ended. The ending is also the key to how we read a film and how we apply genre codes to make sense of cinematic storytelling. This film traverses three totally different but often compatible genres: the psychological thriller, the horror/gore, and the science fantasy, in that order. Note that the last one is not the same as science fiction, a respectable genre that creatively draws on the logic of science. The film 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) starts brilliantly as a thriller, drops a gear or two as horror, and then has an inexcusable brain-snap as mediocre science fantasy.<br/><br/>The linear plot line opens with soon-to-be-married Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) walking out on her fiancé only to drive straight into a horrific car crash. She wakes chained inside a bunker and is held captive by Howard (John Goodman), a doomsday prophet who built the sealed underground structure in anticipation of a major global event. He eventually convinces her that the outside world is now a post-apocalyptic and uninhabitable mess. His neighbour Emmett (John Gallagher) is the only other actor and becomes a confidante for Michelle, but not for long. For the first three- quarters of the film, tension builds then flattens while Michelle becomes accepting of her plight in a claustrophobic space that has all the comforts of home. When Howard's temper shifts into horror and gore mode, Michelle takes flight only to stumble into a B-grade science fantasy created with last century computer graphics. Everything this film achieves in terms of emotional tension, doubt, confusion, and of course, unbridled feargoes up in a puff a smoke.<br/><br/>John Goodman's imposing girth, menacing bluster and steely gaze entertainingly convey total terror with enough glimpses of 'Mr nice-guy' to create confusion. For the most part Mary Elizabeth Winstead ably reflects vulnerability, disbelief and fear, although she settles into domesticity rather too easily. The early unfolding story sustains a level of plausibility, even when Howard starts going weird. The real thrill in this film, however, is watching it crash and burn in the last twenty minutes as it runs out of ideas and takes a bad turn in the hope that the applause of science fantasy fans will drown out the boos of thriller fans. But neither group wins as the ending transforms this film into an incoherent and unforgivable mess."

"hemispheres_89","3","35","59","19 March 2016"," This movie infuriated me - but not for the reasons you might think!
","*Spoilers further ahead so read at your own risk!* I just got out of the cinema after catching the late show of this film on a Saturday night. Now, let me just start off by saying that I have walked out of movies I hated before, sat through movies I hated right until the very end, and movies I absolutely praised to the heavens (I think all of us have been in all of these 3 categories at least once in our lives when it comes to movies).<br/><br/>However, a fourth category has now emerged for me and reared its ugly head - and it is perhaps the worst one of them all! When it comes to ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", this was the very first time I've EVER sat through a movie for its near-2 hour running time, in complete tension and suspense, only for the last 30 minutes to come unhinged so abruptly and vapidly.<br/><br/>Why were so many plot elements introduced throughout the film if absolutely none (and I mean NONE) of them were addressed? This is the problem with filmmakers nowadays - many of them have the ability and talent to showcase excellent traits of a movie, such as atmosphere or good casting choices (as is the case with this movie. More on that later). But none of them have the ability to tie it all together into a cohesive story. Boring and incomprehensible are two things this movie is NOT, but that still doesn't mask the fact that the filmmaker had no idea where he was going with this, and that's very clear from the outset.<br/><br/>Comedy was interspersed throughout the film in little sprinkles, but none of it manifested into anything remotely humorous, given the circumstances. Many films work under the pretense of adding a black comedy component, but it simply doesn't work here.<br/><br/>And then we get the absolute worst ending I've ever seen - what were we supposed to take away from this? That our female heroine suddenly has ""combat skills"" and ""medical expertise"" just because she can crawl through a tiny ventilation system and treat a cut with stitches? Is it supposed to be a rush of sudden girl power? GIVE ME A BREAK! The main protagonist wasn't even the least bit likable, which slightly alienated me from the start. What was the point of the subplot having to do with Michelle's husband calling her repeatedly before the events of the film? Or the one about Howard's-daughter-Megan-that-turned-out-not-to-be-his-real-daughter? Or something like that.<br/><br/>Do any of these things really matter anyway? Nope, because none of them were addressed! And this is what I'm talking about when I say that there was no semblance of a cohesive story. There wee very trace amounts of character depth or perception illustrated here - just a case of more questions being asked than answered, followed by a hallmark of trite clichés to wrap things up before the culmination of the 103 minute runtime. And then.... aliens????? REALLY??? <br/><br/>Now, for the one big positive about this film - John Goodman's performance. He didn't fail to impress here, as per usual, but with a script this lackluster not even his overpowering tour-de-force can save this one. I wish that were the case, though."

","I loved Cloverfield which for me was one of the best films of the 21st Century. I saw it in a cinema and loved it and watched it a dozen times since on DVD and still love it. <br/><br/>Cue Super 8 which insinuated it had a Cloverfield connection but was just about a bad CGI alien spider that made a space ship out of a water tank. Not a bad movie but not great either. <br/><br/>Then out of the blue comes a trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane which may or not be a Cloverfield sequel. The clever use of the word Cloverfield hints at a connection and then J.J. Abrams feeds that with his comments. <br/><br/>If like me you loved Cloverfield then try to be unlike me and don't waste 10 pound on this absolute crock of a movie. Massively disappointed and feel cheated after watching this garbage.<br/><br/>A girl wakes up after a crash in an underground shelter with a young bloke with a poorly arm and John Goodman. He tells her he 'rescued' her as there had been an attack and it's not safe above ground. <br/><br/>In the trailer we see <br/><br/>.....the girl fight her way up the stairs and peer out the doorway with a look of shock. Con trick as it's not what you (and I) probably thought. <br/><br/>.....Something huge seems to walk over the shelter causing stuff to fall on the floor. Again a completely unexplained scene that later makes absolutely no sense at all. <br/><br/>.....The famous drum scene as Goodman dons gloves and starts to open a 40 gallon steel drum. Could it be a Clovy parasite? Or something equally strange and interesting? No it's a nothing scene that reveals nothing we imagined it would be. It does have a bit of shock value and is a central plot device for the finale but still nothing of any great interest to Cloverfield fans. <br/><br/>......Then the outside scene with the explosion the gas mask and the light and roar approaching the barn. When that was revealed I thought WTF? <br/><br/>There we have it. Whilst there may have been some cursory nods to Cloverfield they flash by so quickly that they are not noticeable without freeze and rewind buttons which my cinema did not have. Simply clever marketing using the name Cloverfield prominently to attract attention to a pretty dull psycho film with some utter bilge to end it with. It says something when the film makers have to nick scenes from the incredibly awful WOTW by Stephen Spielberk. <br/><br/>The acting was very mediocre with John Goodman, who is a great actor, seemingly catching a nap as he delivered his lines. The sound was terrible and even in a cinema I could barely hear what was said. The CGI for the finale would make the Sci-Fi channel blush. <br/><br/>I left the theatre 10 pound lighter robbed of nearly 2 hours of valuable time and completely disillusioned with J.J. Abrams All that for this complete twaddle that Alan Smithee would disown."

","I explicitly avoid watching any trailers or reading any reviews from 10 Cloverfield Lane just because I wanted to be certain to be surprised by the story. I just heard from some people that it was good and that's all I needed to know. And I'm glad I did because during the whole entire movie you wonder what is really happening. You think about all the possible scenarios and still you are never sure what is going on. I like those kind of movies, mysteries, that keep you on edge all the time. The cast did a perfect job with their respective performances. And even though there are almost no other actors then the three main ones, John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr, the movie never gets boring. It's full of twists and that's how I like it. One of the better ones I saw this year."
"jtindahouse","9","110","214","9 March 2016"," A brilliant mystery that will keep you guessing until the end
","The first thing I'll say is that I'm not going to spoil a single thing about this film (other than how good it is), because everyone deserves the chance to see this film as I did - without a clue to the answer of the mystery and simply looking for any shred of evidence to guide my opinion. I actually had very little idea what kind of a film I was in for with '10 Cloverfield Lane'. I had seen 'Cloverfield' years back and mildly enjoyed it (according to the rating I gave it on IMDb) but could remember very little of it. I knew what the plot was about and that it was a ""found footage"" film but could remember almost zero specifics. I can tell you though that I won't be forgetting specifics about this sequel for a very long time.<br/><br/>I love nothing more than a well created mystery where the audience are left in the same confused state as the character/s and are filling in the pieces of the puzzle as the same pace that they are. This is one of those films. I see it was originally titled 'The Cellar' before it was reworked into a 'Cloverfield' sequel and I can very well imagine it working all on its own as a stand-alone thriller. <br/><br/>John Goodman is the star of the show. He truly can be a brilliant actor when he sets his mind to a character. He plays the role perfectly never giving away any more than he needs to and adds to the mystery surrounding everything perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also impressed me in the lead role. She's likable and bad ass depending on the scene and plays both equally well.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this film. I think it helps when you go in with no real expectations (as I can imagine a lot of audience members doing for this type of film) and then just out of nowhere you find yourself enjoying the hell out of it. As previously stated I won't give anything away, which leaves my hands tied a touch in discussing one of the key aspects of the film. All that's really left to say in that case is see this film!"

","May contain spoilers so read at your own risk.<br/><br/>Pretty much the WORST potential sequel to an unpredictable monster/destruction/action movie ever. Firstly, this lacks nearly all of those characteristics. Second, when did we find out that this was an alien attack in the first movie? It's almost expected of us to know this as we're waist deep into the second movie before we even discuss what could be outside the bunker. Oh, yeah... right... the bunker, the one we're forced to see from nearly every angle possible because 95% of the movie takes place in it. I feel like I know more about the bunker than I do about the surrounding area, location, and what is happening outside. Completely horrible. I expected MAYBE half of the movie to take place in the bunker, but no... 1hr 20mins into a 90~ min movie, and we're still in there, without having seen one monster aside from John Goodman's angrier side when he realizes Winstead's not going to play the role of his lover/daughter, or whatever. This is literally a movie about a crazed man who has the perfect excuse to kidnap this girl who he ""bumps"" into on the road during the unfolding events of what I assume is the first movie, but we'd never know because we're never told that! Do yourself a favor, and wait for this to hit red box for a dollar rental... or just skip it entirely and watch re-runs of Real World/Road Rules challenge. The scripted drama is far better in those shows than in this. Winstead should have done another Scott Pilgrim film instead of doing this, and the budget they probably spent on making this movie was likely minimal."

Had I known that, I would not have wasted my money.<br/><br/>These people need to choose a plot and stick with it.

","Maybe to be attached to that ""Cloverfield"" movie back in 2008 (Does the time fly?) is the only misstep of this powerful movie. And that thing can be quickly pardoned. Because ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a surprising masterpiece of tension at a small scale that leaves the audience with a big chill far away from the theater.<br/><br/>The less you know about the movie, the better. Also the less you expect somewhat of a direct follow up from the previous, even much better. Although that won't be a problem because the pace of this movie grabs you since the moment Mary Elisabeth Winsted picks the car and then it never let you go. The story is inventive and involving as well the round of performances. Menawhile Winstead is marvelous in the movie and Gallagher Jr. is really good there is John Goodman who gives the really first Oscar-worthy performance of the year. Goodman has always being associated to a comedic roles and he is fully capable of it. But in this terrific thriller he's masterful and flawless. Every time he appears steals the screen.<br/><br/>With a conclusion that will divide the audience (I personally loved it, leaving you terrifically satisfied and pinning up for more) and counting some people that may find this movie a bit of hollow because they were looking for a more prominent monster, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a brave and groundbreaking ""sequel"" that has turned itself into its own. Its ""blood connection"" to the first may be more for a ticket sale rather than a continuation, but this is a independent movie that must be experienced immediately.

","What the hell was this movie? <br/><br/>I am a huge enthusiast when it comes to horror/thriller movies, and once in a while, I really do love myself a good containment movie. Although it seems that this movie was a swing and miss for the type of content that it obviously wanted to portray. Here are the many things that were wrong with this movie: <br/><br/>1. Let's talk about the fact that this girl's kidnapper should not have been the one who was insane. When analyzing a situation like this most people would automatically assume that this poor old man was, in fact, the one who was insane in this movie and would have gotten enjoyment from watching him develop into what they expected while the movie was expanding its plot. To keep all of this short and concise, the right person to have been made insane should have been the one other person in the whole situation; Emmet. Emmet was perfect for the job, along with the fact that this would have been a perfect twist to Michelle, the one who trusted him oh so much.<br/><br/>2. What in the world were the writers thinking when they thought that they could introduce a new character into the movie, and completely ignore giving her a detailed backstory? At the moment, I mean the girl who was killed in the room with the air ventilation system. This killing made me very excited and further proved the fact that Emmet should have been the insane one. He himself said that he helped make the shelter, which means that he had absolute access to it and could have easily had the opportunity to kill a girl that had more of a personal connection to him than Howard. <br/><br/>3. Don't even get me started on the ending. The movie would have been perfectly fine had she escaped and saw the world outside as undisturbed and consistently beautiful, but no, this movie had to play a nasty chord on my heartstrings and introduced a completely unexplained alien along with an alien spacecraft that apparently was ""definitely a military aircraft"". <br/><br/>Goodness, I hated this movie, it was a pain to watch."

","I've only recently watched this on a plane from the States to the UK and I think one of the reasons I'm writing this is how surprised I am to see 1 or 2 rated reviews here.<br/><br/>The set-up is cute - essentially making you guess (and second guess) what genre of film you're watching and the three leads are so good. John Goodman has the eye-catching 'is he or isn't he a loon' part but that only works as well as it does because of the other two.<br/><br/>So it's the ambiguity that makes the whole thing work (other reviews have criticised the static nature of things and 'boooring') but that's what makes it tense. It's set in a bunker - not a lot of room for running around. Plus, you don't quite know who to root for or who may have a yet to be revealed agenda. Well handled, simple and believable in a weird scenario.<br/><br/>The ending (last 20 minutes or so) felt a wee bit daft like it was an idea bolted on to a different screenplay. Having said that, this was 'softened' somewhat by adopting a tone of voice adopted from Carpenter's The Thing (""you gotta be f*****g kidding me..."").<br/><br/>Sorry - genuinely surprised by the haters.

","Now, I knew going into this that it wasn't in the same ball park as the 2008 movie Cloverfield. I was aware of the basic plot but I had stayed clear of trailers and reviews before viewing it as I didn't want to ruin my viewing experience. It was painfully obvious that before I watched the movie it was going to have an alien/monster aspect. The fact that is is named Cloverfield and that I saw a movie poster of the house glowing like a spaceship pretty much confirmed to me, before viewing that there was to be some form of sci-fi element outside of the bunker. And when a movie spends most of its energy keeping you guessing to whether the outside world is infected, when its glaringly obvious (off my two previous points alone) that it actually will be, is a whopping plot hole in my personal opinion.<br/><br/>The lead character Michelle is in a car crash, she awakes in a cell, chained to the wall by a mysterious man, Howard (played perfectly by John Goodman). He tells her that he found her and rescued her by taking her down into a bunker under his farmhouse as the outside world above ground level is toxic and it could take years to become safe for them to leave. It is obvious now that the vat majority of this movie is to be played out in the confined space of the underground bunker, filmed over 4 or 5 rooms, it has a dark, claustrophobic, tense feel to it. Bottled-up environments require good acting to make them work, if you are restricted to 3 characters for 90 minutes in a dialogue driven movie then the acting has to be top notch and convincing. And in 10 Cloverfield Lane, it was just that. The acting was very, very good, especially from John Goodman. He portrayed his character effortlessly, portraying a man who wasn't black or white, he was mysterious, compelling and awkward. He could take you from thinking he was an honest man, to thinking he is a psycho murderer within a matter of seconds. Without his presence, 10 Cloverfield Lane wouldn't have been half as effective.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we are kept guessing if Howard is a good guy or a bad guy. The plot shifts several times, one minute making you think that he is a genuine, honest man to then making you feel as if he is a psychopath, hiding a haunting past. This was interesting and I was very emerged into this aspect of the movie. He swore by the theory that the outside air was contaminated and he kept his prisoners there for their own safety and you were guessing whether this was genuine or if he was simply brainwashing them with fear tactics.<br/><br/>In the end we aren't given the full backstory to Howards life, but enough evidence is there to point to the fact he was deranged. My theory is that his Wife/Daughter left him, he kidnapped the missing school girl and likely resulted in killing her through his depressed psychotic personality. He killed the other main character in the show, having a barrel of acid already prepared to dispose of the body and he had spent years building a bunker below his house for the possibility of an 'alien invasion' (or was it just a chamber where he kept and tortured people?). Either way, all the facts point at Howard being a unhinged, murdering mad man.<br/><br/>Making a safety suit out of a shower curtain, half a Coca Cola bottle and some duct tape, in order to try and escape is simply ridiculous. Surely attack Howard first, then proceed to make your homemade suit would have been a more conventional way of doing things? Rather than trying to hide it from him? Bizarre storytelling to say the least.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 10 Cloverfield Lane was a claustrophobic, well-acted, dialogue driven thriller which was played out very well until the final 15 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Now, where to begin, trying to summarise this abomination of an ending?<br/><br/>1 – The film was well paced and constructed perfectly, offering a really tense viewing with some scenes having an uneasy feel. This was ruined the second she was out of the bunker as it took a complete U-Turn going from 0 - Hollywood in a matter of seconds. <br/><br/>2- As I said earlier, I was expecting some Alien element outside of the bunker, with it being something I was expecting, I wouldn't have been completely against it, however the way in which it was executed was so poor that it just ruined the entire movie. If the aliens had been subtle and attacked with some better directing it could have been saved slightly.<br/><br/>3 – Killing the 'alien' with a conveniently accessible cocktail Molotov, made of a magazine and a wine bottle, by being perfectly able to throw it into its open mouth whilst being dragged up towards it whilst in the seat of a car is just too much for me, I'm sorry. <br/><br/>4 – To finally escape and hear on the radio that survivors must head to Chicago, conveniently as she is driving past a road sign (in the middle of nowhere) that points towards Chicago, is again downright laughable and lazy.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is a shame that the movie fell apart so quickly in the last 15 minutes, prior to the end scene I would have given it an 8/10 or even a 9/10 for the great scenes, acting and storytelling in the bunker. However due to the horrifically poor ending I will give it a 7/10 and I think that may be a little generous."

","Imagine being trapped inside an underground bunker by John Goodman who claims the air outside will kill you. Our damsel-in-distress encounters this appalling predicament in first-time director Dan Trachtenberg's ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" after she awakens from a violent car crash. Worse, she finds herself hooked up to an I.V. drip, her injured right knee chained to a cinder block wall, and 'no service' on her cell phone. Reportedly, producer J.J. Abrams has called Trachtenberg's mild R-rated chiller ""the spiritual successor to ""Cloverfield."" Does anybody remember that mediocre monster thriller? The 2008 sci-fi saga ""Cloverfield,"" produced for $25 million, made over $170 million at the box office. This abominable monster on the rampage opus told its tale by means of ""found footage"" recovered from a camcorder. Never did we ever get a clear picture of the gargantuan that transformed Manhattan into a junkyard. Comparatively, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a one quarter ""Cloverfield"" sequel with a lot of time squandered on a formulaic hostage thriller. Synthesize the ""Room"" with ""War of the Worlds,"" and you've got the gist of the Josh Campbell & Matthew Stuecken screenplay. If you're looking for a full-blown sequel to ""Cloverfield,"" you're going to be disappointed. If you looking for two short films edited together, you might like ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" Audiences that want to see monsters are going to feel cheated, and audiences that want to see a fresh hostage crisis are going to be bored. An attractive twentysomething gal leaves her boyfriend, packs her stuff, and hits the road. Later, after dark, as she is cruising down the highway, somebody out of nowhere smashes into her and she passes out. We neither know who did it nor what did it.<br/><br/>When poor Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""Final Destination 3"") regains consciousness, she finds herself held captive by a hulk of a man. Howard (John Goodman of ""Argo"") served in the U.S. Navy, behaves like a survivalist, but has a sense of humor. She struggles to escape, but Howard thwarts her every attempt until the grand finale. At one point, I thought ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was going to be an immaculate, brightly illuminated version of ""Saw."" For example, after we meet Howard, we discover that he doesn't seem to be such a bad sort. Apparently, he went out of his way to rescue Michelle and then nurse her back to health. He has built an underground bunker equipped with all the luxuries that one might require to endure a long period isolation from everything above ground except the fresh air that his filtration system keeps clean. Moreover, Howard has taken in another individual for the duration. Country boy Emmett (John Gallagher Jr. of ""Jonah Hex"") would have been a track star at a nearby university if he'd gotten on the bus and gone. Instead, he backed out at the last minute. Overall, Emmett turns out to be the most sympathetic character. Roughly three-fourths of the 105 minutes in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" takes place underground, and things grow as claustrophobic as they do tiresome. Mind you, rookie director Dan Trachtenberg and his writers have made the two captives smarter than the average victims. The problem is that he keeps these three characters confined for far too long before we discover that Howard is not only a lunatic but also a liar. Howard has no idea what is happening outside, but he warns Michelle and Emmett that harmful chemical fallout awaits them if they venture outside. Michelle hatches an escape plan for Emmett and her to escape confinement. At this point, things take a murderous twist, and our heroine must rely entirely on her own resources to escape with her skin.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, the last quarter hour yields ""10 Cloverfield Lane's"" biggest surprise and it has a lot to do with ""Cloverfield."" My chief objection to this movie is that I got tired of the drawn out bunker episode. Indeed, suspenseful moments crop up, but some moments don't make sense. We get acquainted with the three characters, and we begin to see the flaws in nice guy Howard's character. If you've seen one hostage movie, however, you know that nothing ever ends well. Watching ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was as bad as watching the 2002 Jodie Foster thriller ""Panic Room."" At least ""The Panic Room"" had some comic relief. Ultimately, as shrewd as the two hostages are in ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" nothing about them is charismatic. The writing is above-average, but the story is far too predictable. For example, in one scene, we watch as Michelle is caught between a rock and a hard place. She manages to escape, and she is at the last barrier when a crazy woman with a blood-speckled face begs to be let into the bunker. Howard convinces Michelle that the contaminated outsider will kill them all with her tainted flesh. Michelle relents, and Howard doesn't chain her up again as he had done earlier.<br/><br/>Of course, once our heroine not only figures out a way to break out of the bunker, but also keep Howard at bay, the rest of ""10 Clovenfield Lane"" turns into a radically different movie. Relief degenerates into abject terror, and Michelle confronts a predator that makes Howard look like the syndicated Hanna-Barbera purple cartoon hippo character Peter Potamus. In the remaining quarter of an hour, our heroine dispatches this new adversary, and suspense mounts during that final fifteen minutes. Nevertheless, it looks like Trachtenberg and his scenarists were so desperate to slough off the initial 80 to 90 minutes of their grimly realistic, but hopelessly tedious hostage drama that they tried to shoe-horn in an episodic sequel to ""Cloverfield."" ""Cloverfield"" was feculence from fade-in to fade-out, and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" appropriates the narrative thread at the last minute to give audiences a cheap shock. Not even an actor as watchable as John Goodman can salvage this monstrous misfire of a movie."

Director shows great promise while still early in his career. 4. Story more important than special effects or pointless action sequences (always a plus for me). 5. Sound effects, usually unappreciated in non-action films, well used to add to the intensity of the drama.<br/><br/>Minuses: 1. We've probably all seen John Goodman play a similar character before. 2. There's a possible murder that took place prior to the film, a plot device never resolved.<br/><br/>Since the film has the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title, a lot of dim light bulbs thought this was a prequel or sequel to the other film and bad mouthed it because it isn't.

They must have fallen asleep during the rest of the movie (when they realized it wasn't Cloverfield 2) or this generation is dumber than I fear it might be.

","10 Cloverfield Lane is a lean movie that is packed with tension throughout. It does not dwell on over dramatizing the character's situation but manages to keeps a very tense atmosphere throughout the movie. John Goodman's performance as Howard is excellent as he is both menacing but can make the audience sympathize with him. He manages to exert a sense of firm authority that would make anyone fall in line in real life. The cinematography helps too. It creates a claustrophobic atmosphere and gives a sense of helplessness. This makes it easy to also empathize Mary Elizabeth Winstead's situation. Throughout the movie, I could feel the awkwardness, the tension and the menace throughout the atmosphere without the use of gore. This is a very clever psychological horror movie with a great twist at the end. (But given the title has a reference to Cloverfield, it should not be much of a twist, however, it still packs great surprise and tension.) The finale is rather open ended, you can see it as either hopeful or bleak. In short, this is an amazing movie and I wish Hollywood could make more movies like that."

","I'm probably in the minority, but I disliked Cloverfield ... intensely! So many of these found footage films as far as I'm concerned, are just an invitation to watch someone's tarted-up home movie. Their producers/directors should be commended for being excellent marketing strategists in being able to convince punters to part with their hard-earned, to watch some (generally) cheap, tacky B feature. Cloverfield was no exception.<br/><br/>However in a significant turnaround, I'm happy to report that the Cloverfield's ""blood relative"" (according to JJ Abrams) is a much better production and a far more interesting story, than its predecessor. Technically speaking 10 CL is streets ahead, with the found footage format dispensed with and a small, but very professional cast employed in telling the story of 3 people dealing (not always on a voluntary basis) with life adjustments in a world affected by the events at the end of Cloverfield.<br/><br/>The cast were uniformly good with Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle and John Goodman as Howard being the obvious lynchpins. Knowing virtually nothing about the storyline going into the film (apart from it having some vague relationship with Cloverfield), I have to admit I was pretty much hooked by the unfolding series of events affecting Michelle pretty early on. And as both her seemingly sometime antagonist and ally, Goodman's Howard is the perfect physical contrast. But very pleasing to see another independently resiliant and strong female lead character being featured in such a surprisingly entertaining and thrilling sequel as 10 CL turns out to be.<br/><br/>Much has been commented about the film's climax. I have to admit to some ambivalence. This is where the relationship to the earlier film is given some clarification, whilst overtly setting up the stage for a later episode. Still rejoicing over the absence of found footage, I guess I could just about accept anything thrown up by the producers. I will admit to some disappointment in that the events are clearly played out in real time, with Michelle emerging from the shelter at what is clearly the beginnings of dusk. For some reason an unlikely darkness then overwhelms the setting within about a minute of screen time and with the subsequent taking up of hand-held cameras, the action suddenly becomes more difficult to discern. Though I was still somewhat relieved, I can understand how others may have experienced some disappointment.<br/><br/>I'll admit to looking forward to the next instalment and even perhaps girding my loins and giving the original another watch, just to see again how well (if at all) it sets up this story."

I could deal with some of the less important details, but the story does not go anywhere in the end. A few examples of these unanswered questions are:
What is Michelle's background?
What happens next?
To what extent did Howard tell the truth?
What role does Britanny play in the story?<br/><br/>All in all, the movie causes a lot of confusion, but the reason I think it still deserves a decent grade is because the tension in the movie is tremendous. I loved how the viewer is kept in suspence throughout the entire movie. The character design is also terrifically done.

Not sure if that would have worked too well if it was still contaminated, but one step at a time. Instead we get a look at an alien space contraption and another one of those 'Alien' inspired monsters, but this one with a bulbous pulsing head with fangs. I wish someone would come up with a creative new look for an outer space monster. Up until then, I thought the writing held up well with enough twists and turns to make you wonder what was going on with Howard and his paranoid fantasies. The description that Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) had of Howard being a 'black belt in conspiracy theory' was a pretty good one. I would like to have come up with that one myself. As it is, once Michelle made it back to the outside world I felt let down considering all that went before.

These issues are really only limited to a somewhat rushed finale, though, and the final result is still a much finer film than its predecessor. It's an incredibly intriguing and evolving mystery-thriller that's consistently entertaining and suspenseful, as it uses its small core cast of well-realised characters to drive the tension within its (mostly) single, increasingly claustrophobic location to expert effect. It's incredibly compelling mainly because of its intense focus on character, while it's the several subtle twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seat as our reading of the situation (always seen through the lens of the protagonist) continues to organically change.

She was in a car crash, and Creepy Dude saved her. Ok, sure, but let's go to the hospital, demands Michelle. Nope, the air is poisoned, creepy Howard confidently tells Michelle, who by now is really sketched out. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) is also locked in the shelter, but he says it's by his choice. He knew about the shelter because he saw Creepy Dud building it a long time ago, so when the attack happened, Emmett rushed over to the farmhouse and essentially forced his way in. Sounds believable, right? Even Creepy Dude is locked in the shelter with them. Is Emmett in on this thing, too?<br/><br/>The story is pretty good and keeps you in the dark. Is creepy Howard telling the truth, or is he brainwashing these two victims? There's evidence of both. Creepy Dude keeps reminding Michelle that he saved her life and she should be a little more grateful. Can't she understand that? Creepy Dude is prone to violent outbursts, but don't worry he won't hurt you, it's just the stress. After all, no one really knows how long they'll all be underground. One year, two?

"zkonedog","10","2","2","25 February 2017"," The Power Of Mystery
","A lot of times (too many times, really), viewers know everything about a film before they even take their seats in the theater. Trailers, promotional material, internet chatter or what you have, the standard film-advertising philosophy now is to show as much as possible to let viewers know exactly what they are getting and can expect. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" breaks all those rules and is the better for it. Filmed almost entirely in secret at Bad Robot productions, a trailer didn't drop for the film until a scant 4-5 weeks before it premiered. Even that trailer didn't give away a cent of the plot. Because of this secrecy, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is able to do something that other films cannot (or will not): allow the mystery to unfold.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) fleeing her boyfriend due to some sort of relationship trouble. Her car is hit, she blacks out, and the next thing she knows is that she is waking up in some sort of bunker chained to the wall. She quickly discovers that she was pulled from the car wreck by Howard (John Goodman), a survivalist who has built a shelter meant to withstand any apocalyptic event. He tells her that the world is in chaos above ground due to some sort of attack (he cannot give exact details about who or what), and that line of reasoning seems to be confirmed by certain events that transpire and the word of Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the other bunker-mate. But is it really as simple as that? Is Howard truly the benefactor he seems to be?<br/><br/>This is one of those films that can't be discussed too much more, because it so deeply relies on the mystery that spoilers can be deadly. Suffice it to say, though, that it truly is a gem in pretty much every aspect. The plot is full of twists, the atmosphere is legitimately tension-filled, and the acting is top-notch all around. It has been quite some time since I've been to a film where I've become that sucked into the events transpiring, but again that is because I was a completely blank slate going in. After the first 15-20 minutes of the experience, I had absolutely no clue what would happen next, and that is one of my favorite types of movie-watching experiences. J.J. Abrams' ""Mystery Box"" is alive and well in this one!<br/><br/>Of course, one can't review ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" without commenting on its lineage with ""Cloverfield"". It's actually pretty simple: this one isn't a direct sequel (it's not like it picks right up where ""Cloverfield"" left off or anything like that), but it does take place in the same ""universe"", if you will, of that original film. Kind of an anthology sort of thing, where different stories can be told in the context of one over-arching narrative. While completely different in style from ""Cloverfield"", this ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is just as compelling in telling a unique story.<br/><br/>Overall, I was thoroughly engaged by ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" from the opening credits to the closing ones. I hope that more films in the future can follow this type of approach and take a more cagey approach to marketing. Sure, this film has great acting, atmosphere, and story, but it really ""works"" because of that sheer power of the mystery. Since you don't know what will happen, the film-making is given free reign to toy with your emotions, making for a powerful cinematic experience."

It is not the kind of movie my wife watches. <br/><br/>It is set somewhere in Louisiana ""40 miles outside Lake Charles"", which is pretty near where I grew up. But it is filmed in New Orleans and surrounding areas up river.<br/><br/>As the movie starts Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle is packing her stuff to leave her apartment, including the bottle of Scotch which will come in handy later. She feels and we hear a loud explosion. We have no idea what is going on. On the road she gets hit by a truck and knocked down an incline. A day or two later she wakes up, with an IV in her arm and shackled to her bed.<br/><br/>She quickly finds out that she is with John Goodman as Howard, in the emergency shelter he built beneath his house, equipped with an air purifier, emergency power, and a stock of food supplies. He says something bad has happened, either an attack from a hostile nation or possible an alien invasion. He says the air outside is not safe to breathe.<br/><br/>She also soon finds out there is another person there, John Gallagher Jr. as Emmett, who had helped Howard build the shelter and who voluntarily entered the shelter for safety. He is a former athlete, not the brightest bulb in the pack.<br/><br/>So as an audience member we have no idea what is really going on. Much of the middle of the movie plays out as three people forming a routine together. But Michelle never accepts that everyone outside is dead, she keeps trying to find ways to escape.<br/><br/>It is a very well done story and Goodman is superb, alternately serious, or funny, or menacing. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Howard indeed was a bit messed up, at one point he shoots and kills Emmet. Some old photos provide evidence that he probably had kidnapped some young ladies. When Michelle does manage to escape, with a hand-made protective suit, the building goes up in flames, Howard dies. But she sees migrating birds in the air, so it must be safe. Then she sees an alien ship that hunts her down and is in the process of capturing her when she takes some paper and the Scotch and makes a Molotov Cocktail, throws it into the alien's mouth, which crashes the alien ship. In the car she gets a radio transmission from Baton Rouge, citizens are beginning to win, they need people in Houston with military or medical skills, so she turns left in the road, the sign pointing to Houston"

","10 Cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and collectively written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. It stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Music is by Bear McCreary and cinematography by Jeff Cutter.<br/><br/>Michelle (Winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...<br/><br/>From the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. For the rewards are plenty. Trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards Howard (Goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? If anything? This only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.<br/><br/>A key strength of it, is that it, via Michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. On the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, Emmett (Gallagher Jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. But of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. Which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...<br/><br/>Superbly acted by the three principals (it's great that some film makers still realise Goodman is a major talent), and technically impressive for sound and vision, this coiled spring thriller is a winner. 8.5/10"
"CinemaClown","Null","2","2","18 July 2016"," A Masterpiece Of Suspense, 10 Cloverfield Lane Is A Wholly Different Beast Compared To Cloverfield
","Surfacing without prior notice, filmed in absolute secrecy & marketed without giving away anything at all, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a masterpiece of suspenseful filmmaking that retains its air of mystery by always staying one step ahead of its viewers. Unpredictable, claustrophobic & making ingenious use of Hitchcockian elements, this orgy of twists n turns delivers the chills with great effectiveness and is further uplifted by stellar performances from its cast.<br/><br/>The biggest mistake one can make while heading into this feature is to approach it as a full-fledged sequel to Cloverfield. Although it does share strands of DNA with that found-footage monster flick, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a different beast. The filmmakers leave a trail of references that connect the two plus there is similarity in their themes as well but this latest entry serves better as a blood relative than a literal sequel and is far more capable of standing on its own.<br/><br/>The story of 10 Cloverfield Lane follows a young woman named Michelle who, after leaving her fiancé following an argument, is involved in a car accident. Waking up to find herself in an underground bunker, she is approached by a guy named Howard who tells her that an apocalyptic event has left the outside world inhabitable and claims to have saved her life. Also present is Emmett who confirms Howard's story but Michelle isn't convinced and attempts to find the truth all by herself.<br/><br/>Directed by Dan Trachtenberg, 10 Cloverfield Lane is crafted with such precision & craftsmanship that it doesn't seem like the work of a first time filmmaker at all. A stunning debut by every means that instantly catapults Trachtenberg into the league of the most promising talents to look out for, its success is also attributed to Damien Chazelle's script that is refined to near-perfection and J.J. Abrams' supervision of the whole production that allowed the new director to spread his wings.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are expertly executed and greatly help in intensifying its ominous ambiance. With majority of the plot unfolding in the underground shelter, the claustrophobic element sets up all by itself and is more amplified by the smooth tracking, steady zooms & piercing movements of the camera. Editing makes sure that the plot remains tightly-knitted, ideally paced & highly gripping from the first frame to the last, while Bear McCreary's background score elevates the tension to a nerve-wracking level.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, we get acquainted wth only three characters in this movie and all of them are given a well-defined arc. The cast comprises of Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman & John Gallagher, Jr. and it isn't just the outstanding singular performances these actors deliver in their given roles but also the terrific chemistry they share with each other that makes us invest in them. Each actor compels the other one to bring their A-game to the table and while Winstead chips in with a strong input, it's Goodman who turns out to be the show-stealer.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, 10 Cloverfield Lane is far better than what I expected it to be and undoubtedly ranks amongst the best films to surface this year. Confidently directed, cleverly scripted, skilfully photographed, impeccably edited, sensibly paced, stupendously performed & aptly scored, it is a downright intense, extremely captivating, incessantly stimulating, incredibly thrilling & ultimately rewarding edge-of-the-seat experience that will effortlessly manage to keeps its viewers guessing throughout its 103 minutes runtime. In short, whether you like Cloverfield or not, 10 Cloverfield Lane comes strongly recommended."
"punky_fish247","7","2","2","15 July 2016"," But what genre?
","It had been a good many years since watching Cloverfield, and upon watching the trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane, I had a pretty solid idea of how this new movie was going to pan out. Now maybe this trailer only showed in Europe or perhaps even just Britain where I'm from, because I can't for a moment believe that people didn't expect exactly what was going to happen after watching the 3 minutes of footage? The twist was given away. The plot spoiled. Anyone with half a brain could've deduced the entirety of the story from the trailer.<br/><br/>So, saying that, I knew what to expect. I went into watching the movie with a pretty strong idea of what was going to happen- and I wasn't far off.<br/><br/>The first 3 quarters of this movie is one movie in itself, and the last quarter is an entirely different one. So far from one another in terms of genre that even despite knowing what was going to happen, I was still stunned by the total change. <br/><br/>The first 3/4 is, honestly, extremely well done. John Goodman portrays such a convincing creepiness and terrifying instability that I found my skin crawling in almost every scene he was in. He completely steals the movie for me. And thank God, because without him I don't think there would be much to hold it up. The psycho-thriller element to this movie is fantastic. If it had remained solely within that genre, I think you'd be working with a solid 9/10. <br/><br/>But the ending just sours it for me. Expected, but not enjoyable. Cool CGI and action is great in itself but after a buildup of drama and tension and claustrophobic social interactions, it just feels odd and misplaced. <br/><br/>All in all, a great movie that's thoroughly worth watching- but I feel the sharp deviation at the end will either confuse and disappoint, or be a snippet of excitement that isn't nearly satisfying enough."
"betucho1993","7","2","2","15 July 2016"," Thrilling, Breathtaking...
","First things first, after watch this movie you will learn that nothing is what it seems to be. <br/><br/>At the beginning you will appreciate what appears to be a well made drama, after a while you will be immersed in a thriller with some awesome actors providing you moments of fear, sadness, uneasiness, terror and disbelief.<br/><br/>The story will make you doubt the movie at first but don't let it make you give up of watching it. You will certainly be captured by the fast changes in the narrative transforming this movie from one thing to another, where in a moment you will be happy watching it and a second after you will be terrorized by something; or wanting to know what is really happening and a moment after seeing all your beliefs crushing down by another event that reveals itself.<br/><br/>It is a awesome movie that anyone who wants to watch different stories should invest an hour in it."
"gar-bran","9","2","2","14 July 2016"," I loved it!
","I really enjoyed this movie. A lot of people are complaining about the end sequence, for me that was the best part. I love sci-fi movies. When your watching this movie you feel for the most part that it is a thriller, and it is. Then at the end it takes a massive turn into the unexpected. Throughout the movie you wondered whether the star protagonist was mad, whether there was a real threat outside, whether this threat was human or alien. I personally hoped for alien. It turned out to be a bit of both, he is mad and there is an outside threat. At the end even the nature of the threat is kept secret for a few more crazy minutes. The whole way through the movie you are kept guessing as to what the truth is. This, and the claustrophobic bunker nature of the movie, made it an intense watch. So at the end the massive release of pressure was really welcomed. I found it really exciting. <br/><br/>I thought the overall pace of the movie was excellent. I really enjoyed the acting by all the stars. John Candy stood out in this dark malevolent role. He usually plays light characters, so this was very different for him. He played it really well. The lead lady was also very good. She was sincere, tough when needed to be, but had an underlying vulnerability which she alludes to when saying 'Anytime things get hard, I just run away!'. This adds more depth to her actions towards the end of the movie, where she actually stands up and fights. <br/><br/>I thought the movie was fantastic. Do not be put off by the negative reviews. It would be a real shame to miss this movie, whether you end up loving it or hating it. It seems to be a real Marmite movie and I can understand that. In this case I am a lover!"

I don't want to give out any spoilers, so I suggest you stop reading reviews of this film and just watch it. hahaha!<br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie that will make you wonder whats gonna happen till the end.. this is the movie for you!<br/><br/>Kudos to the actors, especially John Gallagher Jr, who added a bit of fun and mystery to the mix of characters. John Goodman was great and the lead actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead was phenomenal."
"kedikat","9","2","2","1 July 2016"," Great multiple plot lines.
","The possible plot lines are varied from the start. They continue in multiple possibilities for almost the whole movie. Some new ones popping up. Which is surprising considering the cramped quarters. You never get any extra clues from jumping into another character's point of view. The very few clues, are only observed from the one character.<br/><br/>I really like the way it very casually connects to Clovefield. It would be interesting to see some other stories try and connect to that. Cloverfield left an abundance of loose ends. Seems ripe for others to link into it. Could be a lot of fun to see independent stories build on that original mystery."
"ejacobs23","8","2","2","16 June 2016"," One of the best performances ever
","""I'm sorry, but no one's looking for you""<br/><br/>After a woman suffers a terrible car crash, two men shelter her, claiming the outside world is infected with a chemical attack. A very intense film. 10 Cloverfield Lane does a great job capturing the aspects of thrillers. The mystery, music and unsteadiness in the film made this 100 minutes of anxiety. The use of camera was great, however I do think certain scenes had unnecessarily unsteady camera work. It is very entertaining because you are always in a state of anxiety, fear and the heart pumping quickly. There is this constant vibe of something terrible about to occur and that makes this film all the more better. John Goodman is amazing. He plays his character to perfection and this is some of his best work. Mary Elizabeth and John Gallagher were also great. Elizabeth's use of fear really helps set the tone of the movie. The beginning of this film is great. Not many films can have so much going on with so little dialogue. Once you start you won't want to stop. It will make you want to stick to the ending. It fixates you with the unpredictability of it and you just need to know what is next. I love the use of 90% of it being in one bunker and still being so entertaining. The ending was anti-climatic for me though. If it cut the last 5-10 minutes of the film, it would have been a whole lot better and the ending would have perfectly captured that tone of anxiety and ambiguity the whole film till then had shown. In conclusion, there isn't a whole lot of things this film got wrong. This film isn't perfect but just in general great in all aspects. If the ending was just shortened then this film would be much better. I recommend this to anyone who loves to feel all the emotions this film has to offer.<br/><br/>Final note: For best experience, watch in isolated dark room."
"njb7977","9","2","2","16 June 2016"," I was very impressed by this movie!
","I watch a lot of movies. I enjoy most of them. Some of them impress me, and this is one of them.<br/><br/>The pacing is good. I was never bored (and I'm willing to put up with some of that). The story is well thought out. I'm hardly ever surprised by a movie; this one is right up there with what M. Night Shyamalan does when he's at his best. I really enjoyed the acting. I'm a John Goodman fan, and keep an eye out for his performances. Mary Winstead is also very talented; I've been a fan since Scott Pilgrim. She turns in a very nice performance here. I wish I was more familiar with John Gallagher Jr. He also performed admirably. The combination of these excellently formed that ""suspension of disbelief"" effect a movie is supposed to have when it's well done. That sense of ""yeah, this could happen in some iteration of our universe"". I highly recommend this movie. It mixes elements of survival (ala Defcon 5), drama involving tough-girl leading ladies (Enough), and movies with sweet plot twists (the Sixth Sense comes to mind). All in all, a fantastic debut effort for Dan Trachtenburg. Hollywood, put this man to work!"
"dcarsonhagy","9","2","2","14 June 2016"," Out of the Frying Pan...Back Into the Frying Pan
","Boy, howdy, was I ever surprised by this one!! I absolutely refused to watch any trailers/teasers for this film because I did not want them to ruin my viewing of this movie. I would suggest that for others as well.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" tells a story of a young woman who, in the opening scenes, has apparently broken off an engagement with her fiancée. She has packed a suitcase and is driving to whatever her next destination may be. While she stops for gas, a truck pulls up behind her. That was just the beginning of the tension. After she leaves the gas station, she receives a phone call from her boyfriend, but is not able to complete it because her car is struck (by something) and she is then tossed down an embankment. When she awakens, she finds herself cuffed to a pipe, her leg incapacitated. Enter John Goodman, who plays Howard. He gives a new meaning to creepiness. <br/><br/>I am not going to tell any more of the story, nor what it embodies. All I can tell you is that I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. There are twists and turns aplenty, and just when you think you have it all figured out, you find out you couldn't be any further from the truth. Smartly directed and wonderfully acted, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is somewhere you never want to end up.<br/><br/>The movie is rated PG-13; however, save for a couple of words, it could have been rated PG. There is no blood and gore here, so if you're a fan of that, you'll have to look somewhere else. Atmosphere, acting, and directing take this movie STEPS above others of its genre. Highly Recommended."
"aserdcerebral","7","2","2","13 June 2016"," A Confident feature-debut; Trachtenberg understands Misdirection as a firm tenet for visual horror...
","At the beginning of the movie, our heroine gets involved in a CGI car crash. Those are bad for the makeup. She could have avoided this, but see, she was listening to this guy, Caller ID Ben. He exposits to her how ""they've had a fight, and couples fight."" Yeah Ben, teach her stuff. Because he's giving the worst voice performance since Ahmed Best (Binks J. J.), despite being Bradley Cooper, she'll cut him off. Because the plot doesn't like that at all, he'll redial... <br/><br/>She wakes up in Strange Room, Horror Film. We subsequently learn that, in preparation for the synopsis of the movie (chemical attack contaminates air above bunker..), John Goodman built a vast movie set. He equipped it with all the necessary props...food, DVDs, pop songs for montages, chains and handcuffs for Mary Elizabeth Winstead (heroine), etc. That almost got intriguing.<br/><br/>The handcuffs are only jewelry; he'll come in, give her the key, she'll try to stab him, he'll let her out of her room, and take the key away. Outside the room, she'll meet a generic middle-aged filler-character, Emmett, wearing a bushy beard. Because he's utterly bland, she'll instinctively trust him, the way you do a mirror. He extends a stabilizing man-hand toward her when she girl-stumbles (cued by Screenwriter's Instructions); ""Keep your hands to your self!"" growls John Goodman. Uh, oh; He Knows Something We Don't. <br/><br/>Not that John Goodman is a model bunker-mate either; ""I'd like to watch you pee,"" he informs her, without the clean dialogue. ""I can't with you standing there."" Somebody watched Death Proof. ""This is for my own safety,"" he counters. Oh, all the right retorts. He has the best line in the movie; ""Crazy is building your ark after the flood's already come."" But, by the time he says it, it's too late after the toilet standoff, so the spark of context has long waned from it.<br/><br/>""Stay hydrated, and behave,"" sound advice to Winstead. If she'd heeded it, the whole movie would be a loop of the above paragraph, so she misbehaves and tries to........ never mind; like you might have predicted she would, naughty girl. <br/><br/>If you're going to trap the audience with a quarter-dozen characters, it's not enough that we just stand them; we need to love to hear their dialogue, to watch dramatic friction between them heat up the room, to love watching them move in space. (Jack Torrance, Danny, Tony, Joy Newsome, Daisy Domergue..) So what characterizations does Dan Trachtenberg accord his actors? Well, Winstead as Michelle (otherwise delightful) has a tendency to sound like a low-battery speech synthesizer...but, this is motivated; she's sedated, so, there's smart writing. She does come with a great fake laugh. That's what a reasonable actress does, upon reading a screenplay with (intentionally) bad humor and MICHELLE LAUGHS written under all the jokes. John Goodman has the uncanny ability to show up....just off-screen so the cam grip can whip-pan to him; ""Boo! I Was Listening The Whole Time."" That's usually the Xenomorph's part, but Goodman'll do.<br/><br/>Thinking I was being over-picky, I paid close attention to Goodman in his close-ups and medium shots; he can't keep himself from looking into the lens, The Office-style, twitching close to laughter at the edgeless expository dialogue he's been given. Maybe that's a long-term side effect of all that tasty Coen-brothers' dialogue... Or, maybe he's heard some spoilers about his character; it's both.<br/><br/>Because the movie deviates from the Horror Formula, feeding off the personas of Goodman and Winstead (hungry feeding there), it sidesteps a lot of the clichés we'd expect, but it's still cumbered by the ones we could have guessed; Winstead Reminds Goodman of His ""Daughter"" (smiling, a stock memory, in a photo, ...and in a tee-shirt); Emmett Blew His Chance at a Good College (scared of them smart kids!); They All Bond Over A Pop Song Montage; Etc. This stuff is supposed to deepen the characters, give them an existential edge; it just reminds us of the last movie we heard and saw this stuff in.<br/><br/>So, what's the film about? ""We'll get attacked by South Korea.."" ""You mean; North Korea.."" ""Is that the crazy one?"" The very best way, like Billy Wilder once instructed us, to tell the audience a truth that'll taste bitter is to make them laugh; you didn't see Paramount emails leaking for this. So while the movie isn't hauling any speciesist or nationalist agendas, it certainly has undertones of rigoristic preparedness and apocalyptic paranoia. It is, after all, a Cloverfield Movie. Does it have anything new to say about what it's about? It doesn't have to; you don't watch Jaws for some fishing lessons.<br/><br/>For a guy, using fifteen million dollars to make a Studio Movie that didn't need to be any good, Trachtenberg did no wrongs. Excluding the crash sequence, his movie doesn't contain a single terrible cut, a claim only one in a thousand movies can make. Horror films tend to work toward disorientation through poor mishmash editing and obscure lighting. Trachtenberg goes the other way, using the spare amount of true drama his film has to offer to misdirect our suspicions. He keeps on setting up situations, inherently shaky, and showing the audience he's aware of this by his intelligent choice of resolution. A lot of actual trope subversion happens here, as opposed to trope shout-outs (like Deadpool). Because the film is rooted in unalloyed realism unless it's forced not to, it's extremely terrifying whenever it's forced not to. 7/10 for unadulterated competence. There's a point, when Winstead has to choose between driving to safety, or to a sequel.... I'd have made the same choice."
"for-84182","3","11","20","29 May 2016"," What??
","10 Cloverfield Lane had a nice idea for a story line, however the 'alien' thing was terrible. It was so slow throughout the film that my partner and I were falling asleep at points in the film, then at the end suddenly it goes from mystery/thriller/suspense to an alien horror. All I can say is.. what on earth were the writers thinking? Choose a genre and story line, and please stick to it instead of that bull. I understand he mentioned things about aliens, however up until the moment she left the shelter all evidence was pointing to him making the scenario up and being delusional. It was all over the place. Another thing is my partner and I were losing our minds over the fact she was so loud. I swear she wanted to die, instead of quietly and quickly getting away, she was admiring the birds and clashing into every little thing. Yes, she was nervous. Yes she had realized there was no disease. But she was disregarding the danger coming after her. Furthermore, what happened to Megan and Brittany? We can only assume that they were killed, but it was never confirmed. It was as though her entire existence was disregarded and leaves me wondering exactly what happened. I could go on further, but I think it would be easier to say this film has major flaws that could be improved on. Three stars for acting, but that's all."

"JontheLobsterLover","10","9","16","5 April 2016"," This is not Cloverfield 2
","The key to liking this film is to understand what you're watching. I did not go into this theater expecting a direct sequel to the original Cloverfield, just like I didn't watch Prometheus expecting an Alien prequel. You have to take it for what it is. When J.J. says that it's a ""blood cousin"" of Cloverfield, I interpreted that as meaning it's a part of a shared universe, or something along those lines; and that's really the best approach in my opinion to have.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is the trailer. It gives you nothing, and at the same time sucks you in. It sets up a mood instead of spoiling any scenes. During the trailer there is not dialogue, on the song ""I think we're alone now"" playing. It's the perfect song because it starts off on an upbeat; giving you sense of hope for a fun time, then the tone smoothly shifts in the opposite direction. In my opinion, the trailer is as well made as the film is. <br/><br/>What really made this film incredible for me was the tension it builds. The biggest key to that tension is John Goodman's portrayal of Howard. I spent the entire film trying to figure out ""Is he insane; is he not insane; or is he a mixture of both?"" I felt bad for him, and at the same time I feared him. His outbursts are almost immediately followed by a tender or quiet moment, which really screws with your mind. <br/><br/>Both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. did amazing jobs as well. The chemistry between them is incredible, and because this film has very few characters in it, the character development is equally incredible. You don't quite know where they are going, but you do get an understanding of where they've been, and of what they've been through. Their characters are relatable, and because of that you fear along with them. <br/><br/>Thankfully there are very few jump scares. Instead, as I've mentioned above, they rely heavily on the fear of the unknown. The film let's your imagination wander, and when you think you may have started to figure something out they throw you a curve-ball and mess with your mind some more.<br/><br/>Go see this film with the understanding that it's NOT A DIRECT Sequel OF ANY KIND to Cloverfield. That needs to be completely out of anyone's head before seeing this because you will be disappointed. If you pay attention you can spot some connections. <br/><br/>I've seen it twice now and I loved every second of it both times. In my opinion it's not only a really fun film, it's also a very well made film."
"itziktamar","2","12","23","23 April 2016"," Why the Cloverfield connection?
","I came out of the theater feeling betrayed. Yes I knew this isn't Cloverfield 2 before going to the theater but as a huge fan of the first Cloverfield I went just to see what's going on in the Cloverfield universe. This movie destroyed it all.<br/><br/>First and foremost, why even give us the Cloverfield connection? As this is yet another ""Is there a catastrophe outside or is he just insane"" kind of movie (a genre we've seen at least 5 times in films already) connecting it with Cloverfield is just stupid since it takes the tension away. We know exactly what's waiting outside... With that, we know she WILL eventually get outside and so I spent all movie simply waiting for that moment not caring at all what will happen in that bunker, it was so obviously coming I had no interest in it.<br/><br/>Then when she gets outside this movie manages to utterly destroy the Cloverfield story as well. The fight is well under way, apparently so far into it that humans have already figured out the way to fight the aliens (that apparently sent the monster from the first movie as a weapon) and it's all coming to an end.<br/><br/>I feel cheated, I feel JJ decided to lure Cloverfield fans into a movie that's been done before and we've all seen many times, then connecting it to the first movie with 10 minutes at the end made in a stupid way that makes you think he didn't even care much about the Cloverfield storyline.<br/><br/>Then after you leave the theater all annoyed that you've been jacked, you get even more angry finding out this ISN'T IN ANY WAY connected to Cloverfield except for baiting you into buying a ticket. At this point you just want to say **** you JJ, this is trolling at it's best."

The biggest reason for this is that the entire movie feels grounded and has characters that you want to root for. This movie takes place in a small bunker so you're constantly learning about the characters which is the most important thing in a movie. John Goodman completely steals the show with an intimidating bipolar performance. What made this movie work for me, is that his character wasn't just some creeper in a room, but a developed person who made sense being where he was and why. As it is a spin off of Cloverfield, you know the monsters are real BUT this movie adds on more wrinkles to keep you guessing throughout. The ending may mot work for some people, however, after all the build up it felt earned and worked for me. There is also a good sense of irony which adds to the humour making this transcend the ""horror"" genre. From the camera work to music to performances, this movie succeeded at building up a world of suspense."
"bdpca","10","12","24","12 March 2016"," Surprised at how well done a movie could be
","How could post apocalypse film be flipped over again after it's been cooked to shoe leather on the grill of repetitiveness? Through the acting of its three main characters, a decent story but more directly the ability to build all the characters back stories (except the female protagonist, all we know is she dated Bradley Cooper), hint at the devastation outside enough to explain the story but not reveal it, add psychopathy and sweetness into one character and minimal use of special effects, turns this dried out and over done steak into some juicy filet. Few movies since Hitchcock can sustain a level of tension through out 2 hours and keep it constant. Few movies can re invent a usual apocalypse in a new way., few actors could play sweet and sour as good as Goodman can as his performance is a tied that rises all ships. The bunker itself is a character that has a story to tell. The story leaves us asking if it's right to do the wrong thing if eventually you turned out to be right even though you were doing dastardly things to compensate for a dastardly thing done to you. Whoa. Do we have sympathy for that character or do we applaud when it goes downhill for him. I still don't know if we should have sympathy or gratitude for someone who we want to believe is a misunderstood good guy when the facts and some evidence point out he is really a sociopath responsible for a hideous crime but can understand why he is the way he is. It's like finding out Santa was Jeffery dahmer. Lastly I have never seen a movie that made a previous okay movie seem much better. It seems to explain its predecessor and gives it a few more movie points even though it is explained 10 years later. Well done and entertaining. Also great job keeping the violence slightly off screen we didn't need to see it and it had a greater effect."

","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is nothing like ""Cloverfield"" ! I don't know why sites are giving it good ratings. I feel like I was tricked into seeing a movie I wouldn't ordinarily see. Imagine if you went to see a movie called Star Wars and turned out to be a claustrophobic sequel to ""Signs.""<br/><br/>By itself it would be an alright movie, but it didn't need to be a sequel to anything. The bunker part of the movie lasts way too long for it to be a sequel to Cloverfield. The acting is good. The movie did managed to make me uncomfortable. Towards the end it started to get better. Unfortunately the last 20 minutes is not the first 20 minutes. I found myself thinking ""alright this is looking more like the kind of movie I was wanting to see"" and then the movie was over."

"msbreviews","9","3","4","6 August 2017"," Rating: A
","This is an amazing claustrophobic thriller with a major part of the runtime spent in just one confined space. Starting with the pros, I have to congratulate the director Dan Trachtenberg because this was his first feature film and it was brilliant, full of tension and suspense.<br/><br/>Then, the actors: all of them were great  John Goodman as Howard is perfect! You know that he did an awesome job when you spend the whole movie unable to figure out if he's really insane or not. In one scene, he may seem crazy, but in the next one he's completely normal and that makes us and our hero, Jessica, with no idea of what's true or not. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also really great, probably her best performance so far and her character is definitely someone who you care for. Usually, in this type of movies, the hero is not really smart and does things that are nowhere near rational, but in this movie she is and she's ahead of Howard, most of the time.<br/><br/>John Gallagher Jr. plays Emmett and he also gives a good performance. However, his character was not as compelling as the others and that's fine since this movie concerned more Howard and Jessica. Still, he was in the moment of the movie where my jaw just dropped of how intense that scene was. This movie gives small hints along the way (book in a shelf, someone's former profession ) and, if you connect all of them, the ending will not come as a surprise (only if you've seen Cloverfield, which was a ""prequel"" to this film  I will talk about it at the end of the review and after my rating since it has a minor spoiler for 10 Cloverfield Lane).<br/><br/>The ending felt rushed, it's really abrupt and it can leave you a little disappointed, at first. After thinking about all the hints given through the movie, the sounds that were heard and some dialogues, you connect everything and it doesn't feel that fast anymore, so it actually worked for me.<br/><br/>————————-MINOR SPOILER WARNING————————-<br/><br/>In Cloverfield, there was a giant monster destroying everything and, at the end of the movie, there's a flashback where, in the background, you can see a dark point falling from the sky (really easy to miss). That was a satellite (Howard's former profession involved working with satellites) and it, supposedly, woke up the Cloverfield monster.<br/><br/>Knowing this, the end of 10 Cloverfield Lane will make more sense to you and, in some way, will smooth away the rushed ending.<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"neilion90","1","3","4","6 July 2017"," I make a case for why I think this movie royally stunk. See if you agree.
","Okay, so you might be wondering, out of all the positive reviews this movie has gotten, why somebody would give it an awful rating. Well, I'm going to make my case, and I think you will see that I made a valid point. And if not, that's okay, it's just a movie, so we don't have to agree.<br/><br/>When this movie was first teased about in the trailers, it was pretty much universally understood that it would be the sequel to the monster movie ""Cloverfield"".<br/><br/>Let's just stop right there. If this was supposed to be the sequel to Cloverfield, I think it may have beaten Halloween 3 as the worst sequel ever. It had absolutely NOTHING to do with Cloverfield. Nothing. I'm no film expert, but I'm pretty sure you're breaking the rules of good filmmaking when you make a sequel that isn't in any way connected to the previous film. That's like making a movie like 007 James Bond, then making a sequel, calling it something like 007 Boulevard, but James Bond isn't in it, nor ANY of the first films characters. I'm sorry, but that is just dumb.<br/><br/>Now, I will give credit where credit is due. The movie was very suspenseful and I found myself rooting for the protagonists and hating the antagonist. The acting was decent and the story thought provoking. However, all of that became null and void in the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. You see, I was still under the assumption that I was going to see a connection with Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Nope.<br/><br/>I realized I had been lied to like the main girl was lied to about the outside air being toxic. You might think I'm being harsh, but I honestly think that if a director thinks they can concoct a decent, suspenseful story as a way of making up for zero connection with the previous movie, they either think their audience cares more about entertainment than common sense, or they just want to make a buck using a thought provoking title. I'm thinking it's a bit of both.<br/><br/>I hated this movie. I might be the only one, but hopefully you understand where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my rant."

","I enjoyed the moral ambiguity of John Goodman's character derived from the confusion about what exactly the situation is. Figuring out whether he's a good guy or a bad guy made me think about the lines and I couldn't help but think about societal structure as well. What's preventing him from murder if there are no longer laws? What are the rules in a post- apocalyptic society? There was no voting about the rules here, just an authority imposing his will on his captives. The movie makes you think about whether or not that's enough to make him evil.<br/><br/>Filler filler filler."

","10 Cloverfield Lane is not a movie for everyone. Although my taste generally does not include bizarre movies like this, it was a refreshing experience all the same. It is different from most of the other movies I watch and the only other movie beating it in on my bizarre scale was No Country for Old Men. It actually challenged my opinions of movies. The mindset that Michelle(Ms.Winstead) that Michelle embodies is masterfully done. One can many a times predict her actions and that's actually a good thing, providing us with a nearness to the character that one frequently comes across in movies of the modern times."
"dgm-48750","8","3","4","12 July 2016"," Superb, taut thriller spoilt by ending
","OK, I've given this 8/10 and yet will criticise a part of this movie that many will feel is the most critical part. There is logic there though, so bear with me...<br/><br/>I saw Cloverfield years ago. It was an okay-film if I remember, with an absurdly long and poorly acted first act. I never had the urge to watch again, so went into this one with more trepidation than anything.<br/><br/>I was wholly wrong. The film was outstanding. What developed through about 95% of the running time was a taut, suspenseful thriller with some great acting and a plot which was subtle and kept you wondering about peoples motivations. <br/><br/>John Goodman is great in this, being homely and creepy in one bundle. The girl is too resourceful to be completely believable but these are extreme situations so this can be overlooked. Her captive companion works well as a device to make you re-question Goodman's motivations. <br/><br/>If someone came into this film on the basis of loving the original Monster-themed movie they would be hugely disappointed. This had echo's of other films or TV shows - Misery for one, Wayward Pines too. But no monsters, aliens or found footage to be seen.<br/><br/>At the end of her captivity, the horrifying realisation that everything outside the bunker is 'normal' is palpable given the preceding carnage. Standing on the truck and then realising that all is not as it seems as in the distance a flying craft that doesn't look vaguely terrestrial start flying towards her, is quite a shock moment and subtly done. <br/><br/>If the credits had rolled at this very point this movie would have scored a 10. All the questions about Goodman's character would have been flopping around in your mind whilst realising that her fatal mistake had been picking a worse fate over a potentially bad one. You would have left with that desire to hop on CTDB and see what the various theories were.<br/><br/>But then we are treated to a final few minutes of ridiculous CGI alien attack, where the female lead suddenly turns into an all-action alien-ship destroyer armed only with a bottle of scotch, a lighter and a fantastically aimed powerful throw.<br/><br/>We simply didn't need this. We didn't need to know that there were various camps for survivors. We didn't need to have a hard-to-follow CGI workout at the end of this movie. <br/><br/>So instead of leaving talking about all the what-if's, we are talking about how poor the ending was. So this is a movie where less really would have been more, and having the ending we did was bitterly disappointing.<br/><br/>We don't need whooping-and-a-hollering action sequences to leave a lasting impression. The Mist was a similarly taut film (more in the horror mould) with a downbeat ending which was more horrifying that an explosive action sequence could ever deliver.<br/><br/>So why the '8' rating? Well I still think the movie stands on it's own right up until the big alien reveal, and if you are prepared to turn off at this point, or disregard the following few minutes then you are left with an amazingly gripping thriller which stays in the memory for the right reasons.<br/><br/>I'd certainly recommend others watch this, as long as the expectation is that this ISN'T a monster movie in the vein of the original."

","Not often has there been a sequel with such a difference in characters, plot, and filmmaking such as Cloverfields'. Certainly almost everyone watching the movie knows a monster awaits outside besides the lead character Michelle. She faces a different monster, one that has taken custody of her and keeps her as company in his apocalyptic safe rooms. John Goodman plays his part perfectly as an insane doomsdayer and Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job as the lead actress as well. The film is very dialogue driven and accounts for a tug-of-war of feelings on what safety really is in this case. 10 Cloverfield Lane is an intense psychological roller coaster that builds up to the final scenes. There were some aspects of the ending film that was disappointing but will be left unsaid for spoiler purposes. Solid unconventional sequel!"

"tomgillespie2002","7","3","4","28 June 2016"," Utterly nerve-jangling when it's not busy trying to shoe-horn in a link to Cloverfield
","Apart from the rather cryptic title, there seems to be little connecting Dan Trachteberg's feature debut 10 Cloverfield Lane with J.J. Abrams and his Bad Robot Productions' relatively well-received shaky-cam monster movie Cloverfield from eight years ago. Starting life as a claustrophobic thriller penned by Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken called The Cellar, Abrams claims to have noticed thematic similarities between the two during pre-production and decided to work the story into the Cloverfield universe, offering the odd wink or nod here and there along with the occasional hint at the state of the outside world following the arrival of the bandy-limbed kaiju and its pesky offspring.<br/><br/>Any fans of the first film looking for more of the same will be sorely disappointed, but surely captivated nonetheless at the gripping events that unfold here. The film begins almost dialogue- free with our heroine Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) packing up and leaving her apologetic partner (voiced by Bradley Cooper) for some unexplained yet irrelevant reason. After she is hit by what seems to be another vehicle whilst driving in the darkness, she wakes up chained to a wall and hooked up to a I.V. drip in a dingy cellar. She soon meets her captor in the hulking, intimidating Howard (John Goodman), who slides her some food and expects a thank you in return.<br/><br/>Eventually her shackles are loosened and she is informed that she was rescued when the country, or possibly the world, was hit by an attack from an unknown source. Howard lists everything from al-Qaeda to alien invaders as the possible culprit. Yet while everyone was laughing at the ex-Navy man's conspiracy theories and paranoia, he was preparing for such an event by building an all-singing, all- dancing bunker equipped with electricity, an air filtration system, movies, board games, puzzles, and all manners of activities designed to pass the time during a long stretch waiting for the air outside to clear. The bunker has another resident, the upbeat Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who confirms Howard's claims of the apocalypse but shares Michelle's concern for his unpredictable behaviour.<br/><br/>There's plenty of fun to be had with trying to decipher Howard's intentions and figuring out just what the hell has happened outside the extremely secure door. The presence of two dead pigs visible from the window seems to concur with Howard's speculations of a gas attack, but what is with the frequent rumblings heard overhead? You'll also be chewing your fingers down the bone, as Trachtenberg forges an almost suffocating atmosphere from what is a pretty standard cinematic setting, with Goodman delivering the finest performance of his career. He is clearly unstable with a social ineptitude, but there is sympathy to be had when we learn of his tragic backstory. Clues to his character are given with an extreme subtlety, with an uncomfortable game of charades in particular offering suggestions that there may be a whole lot more going on than first imagined.<br/><br/>Winstead too, is very good, and its a wonder why her career has hit a bit of a slump of late. Michelle isn't just a pretty damsel in distress, but a strong, intelligent young woman with a crafty side of her own. With one eye permanently on the door and the other locked in suspicion at her apparent saviour, her desire to see what happened for herself offers many moments of nerve-jangling tension. Where 10 Cloverfield Lane doesn't really convince is when it's working that eye-catching word into its title. For anyone unaware of the Matt Reeves' 2008 film or those so completely caught up in the main story that it has just slipped their mind, the climax may be too much of a shift in tone. While its likely to cause the movie to linger in your mind for slightly longer than it would have if it had remained a stand-alone drama, it seems rather pointlessly shoe- horned in. But don't let that put you off, as for 90 minutes at least, 10 Cloverfield Lane is outstanding performances from a talented cast and riveting drama that occasionally weaves into horror territory."
"Reno-Rangan","8","3","4","24 June 2016"," Adds a new perspective to the original film yet it retained the mystery.
","Initially it was called 'The Cellar', but later it became spin-off to 'Cloverfield'. It was a regular type screen narration, unlike the first film as a found footage style. But if you the original film fan, especially monster film fan, you might end in a disappointment. Because it was a psychological-thriller-mystery than the sci-fi-action- adventure.<br/><br/>Only the final act determines where and how it actually connects to the Cloverfield universe, yet not very evident other than the clue the title had given and the filmmakers insisted that is indeed from the same franchise. Because I felt, it was very close to other alien invasion films like 'Skyline' and 'Battle LA' or even the latest 'The 5th Wave' than the 'Cloverfield'.<br/><br/>I surely enjoyed this film, like an another crazy bunker hideout theme and something which is quite similar to the recent 'Room'. Since they have revealed its association with the 'Cloverfield', I expected different kind which was actually insanely misled everybody. If there won't be a sequel, then the link between the two films are unnecessary, so I'm waiting for that. But still a very good film without those mix-ups. And I recommend you all to consider it as a one-off film in order to have a great watching experience.<br/><br/>Another limited cast film with barely a four characters in it and shot in a single location that cost just $15m, but earned in multiple folds. All the credit goes to the marketing tactics to tie it up with the 2008 blockbuster. It would have also done great independently, in the end everybody, including fans and filmmakers are happy for what it is now.<br/><br/>The suspense was so good, but it was carried out for too long. The third act picked up its pace like hell which was obviously anticipated since 'Cloverfield' hooked to it. When everybody was thinking of monsters, it is going to delivers differently and that's how the film fairs.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"mark-durfor","8","3","4","21 June 2016"," Mysterious Thriller Delivers on Vague Preview
","10 Cloverfield Lane is exactly why I love doing these previews and reviews. The movie begins, just as the preview suggests, with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) getting into a pretty bad car accident. When she awakens, she is handcuffed to a wall in a bunker. Her captor, or savior, Howard (John Goodman) informs her that it's not safe outside of the bunker. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr) is also in the bunker and appears to be Howard's friend, or co-captor. It takes a little while to reveal this, but Emmett helped Howard build the bunker and begged to be let in when whatever happened outside the bunker happened. Michelle attempts to escape despite Howard's fervent pleas that he is doing this for her own good.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Dan Trachtenberg who really hasn't done much before this release. I love me some John Goodman. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has been around, but isn't a big name actress. She was in A Good Day to Die Hard as John McClane's daughter Lucy and was in a cute film Scott Pilgrim vs. The World as Romona Flowers, Scott's love interest. There's actually a scene in the movie that Die Hard fans will be waiting for Michelle to say, ""Come out to the coast, have a few laughs."" If you don't know what I mean, you aren't a true Die Hard fan. Spoiler alert, she doesn't say it.<br/><br/>My point is, you know you're going to get something great from John Goodman and JJ Abrams, but the rest of the cast and crew, along with the preview, leave you wondering what exactly that something is. It's wonderful. It looks like a great thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and also guessing as to the true motives of Howard and Emmett in the bunker. I had no idea what I was about to get into, but I was excited to see 10 Cloverfield Lane. Just like the ambiguous trailer, the movie itself keeps you guessing as to Howard's true intentions and what, if anything, really happened outside the bunker. It has twists and turns and the last half hour had me saying, ""Wait, what?"" ""No way"" and ""What the what?"" at least 5 times. I anticipated 4.0 stars for a well-written, well-acted, twisting scary movie that I might just want to buy and watch again, and I'm sticking with that. Well worth it and might just add this one to my collected, but definitely want to see again."

That said ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a highly enjoyable thriller, with superb performances by all three leads - especially by John Goodman. If you liked the first movie, it kinda doesn't mean you will enjoy this one as well, because the setup and the whole story is set totally different, it only shares the same universe.

"peggyatthemovies","8","3","4","11 March 2016"," Psychological Thriller with a nod of Sci-Fi fun..
","Not a big surprise that a sequel seemed like a logical choice to 2008's ""Cloverfield"" by JJ Abrams as it was a big hit comparatively with a 25 million budget, while grossing right around 170 million. The 'found footage' film about a group of young people surviving a monster attack in Manhattan was driven by a highly sophisticated and fun marketing campaign. Mysterious trailers of the film 'Untitled' left you guessing as to what was the content, was also really well received by critics & film-goers alike.<br/><br/>While not quite the exact same thing here, JJ Abrams sees '10 Cloverfield Lane' as a kinsman of ""Cloverfield."" And that's a good description because although there could be a comparison of a few elements, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very different kind of film and can stand on it's own. Do not expect found footage film or a direct sequel or prequel. '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a pure psychological thriller, with a little taste of Sci-Fi thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>It's mainly undertaken all in one place, the bunker of the mysterious Howard (John Goodman). The bunker is a typical doomsday place: an underground space filled with food, drinks and all the comforts of home, including a cozy living room and fully functional kitchen, ya know, for those underground bunker dinner parties. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is excellent as the frightened but brave one, who basically MacGyver's her way through this film. Even John Gallagher Jr. as the simple Emmett is well cast. The biggest surprise is John Goodman as Howard, a role that is seemly tailor-made for him, as he turns the effortlessly friendly man into a creepy psycho without ever giving away which of the two he is and in turn, giving us a whole other level of fear. <br/><br/>'10 Cloverfield Lane' will truly have the most impact if you have minimal knowledge of it before hand because it's nail biting exciting. And any reviewer that gives away the spoilers or the full story of this one, I wish them years of paper cuts because this is one to be experienced, not told about. The only minus is the last act of the film, here and there, it flies off the rails, But you forgive debut director Dan Trachtenberg for this little whim, as I loved the fact that just when you think it won't go there.. it does! It's very clever and with fresh inspiration, gives just the right subtle nod to its successful predecessor. For those who love psychological mind-bending films like this, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Grade: B <br/><br/>Review Screening: Wednesday, March 9, 2016 ~ Courtesy of Paramount Pictures"

","I know nothing about the Cloverfield franchise - and I had no interest in it before - but I recently heard that JJ Abrams has a habit of attaching the franchise to 2 random indie films to expand on the ""lore"". One of them is good, one of them is not. So this peaked my interest on what all the fuss is for Cloverfield and why everyone was watching its ""blood-relatives"". So I'm watching them in non-chronological order.<br/><br/>But how was 10 Cloverfield Lane? If it weren't for that stupid last 10 minutes, it's actually fantastic. It's claustrophobic, suspenseful, smart, well-crafted, and reveals many plot points with more elegance than the average horror film. The performances are great, the built-up tension is excellent, the sound-design creepy, the characters are interesting, and the villain is horrifying. At times he seems sympathetic, kind, and charming, but other times a murderous, mentally-disturbed old guy that couldn't be played better by anyone else but John Goodman. It's best if you go in with no expectations or knowledge of the plot to let the clever script toy with your emotions more. <br/><br/>But that doesn't mean you'll get a modern masterpiece. Some moments felt like they dragged on longer than they should and the silly ending loses a lot of tension. All the praise I've gushed about was apparent for most of the film, but at the very end producer JJ Abrams let the filmmakers reshoot a few scenes to let the Cloverfield lore shoved in in the most unsubtle way possible. It doesn't ruin the film, but it DID ruin a few scenes that were building up to something only to forget why it was even there. I'm not entirely sure if changing the ending will still make the film a flawless one as it does feel 15 minutes too long, but it wouldn't suddenly shift to sci-fi.<br/><br/>It's still a solid, entertaining, and bone-chilling thriller that had the potential to be great but ended up being really good. If you have the weird Cloverfield interest that I have now, go watch. If you're not interested in Cloverfield, go watch. If you're a fan of Scott Pilgrim, then Ramona is the main lead. So... go watch!"

This is essentially a good solid B-movie with a souped-up third act. I would like for more claustrophobic paranoia but it delivers enough."
"d_stanev91","7","4","6","12 June 2016"," I have an idea how to make this movie so much better
","Again, people, SPOILER WARNING. This is literally my first review on IMDb ever, I have read many, but this movie made me want to finally give my own opinion for a change. Okay, so about my idea. Cut the last ten minutes of the movie or so. Michelle goes out. She sees there's no poisonous air. She sighs with relief. She sees an alien spacecraft. She says ""OH COME ON"". ROLL CREDITS. Absolutely every second after this point was completely unnecessary in my opinion. They could even make a sequel which is actually about fighting aliens and stuff, sure, whatever. But hiding from an alien in a barn, while it just doesn't see her. Putting her makeshift hazmat suit in a matter of seconds, avoiding the poisonous gas that killed thousands or so ? KILLING A HUGE ALIEN WITH A BOTTLE OF ALCOHOL ?! Deciding to play the hero and go help other people ? What was that about, she's just a normal person who was caught in a bunker with a maniac and some other dude who just gets killed off anyway. Goodman was amazing, main actress was also pretty good, but I just started disliking her whole character at the end, since it made no sense whatsoever."
"rs9017720","9","4","6","25 March 2016"," Surprisingly great, but don't expect a Cloverfield sequel.
","Personally I have never been a big fan of the original Cloverfield. I was too young to get the viral marketing, and upon re-viewing it, I thought the story was basic, the characters were annoying, and the found-footage style was irritating. So suffice it to say I was absolutely fine with a ""blood-relative"" of the first film as opposed to a direct sequel. And looking back, 10 Cloverfield Lane is better than the original in just about every way. The characters (and phenomenal actors) are much better, the cinematography is great, and the story is more original and interesting. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is an easy protagonist to latch onto, and John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr. are also phenomenal. The only negative aspect of this movie is really the fact that it seems to have nothing to do with the original Cloverfield, but even then, I am much more interested in a Cloverfield series that is more parts Twilight Zone one-offs than it is Godzilla (we have Godzilla for that). Its no masterpiece, but 10 Coverfield Lane is thoroughly enjoyable in about every aspect. 9/10"
"OlieRendch","9","4","6","24 March 2016"," Perfect directorial début and a refreshing narrative.
","So 10 Cloverfield Lane stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher Jr. The basic premise is that a woman wakes up in an underground bunker where she is told that a chemical apocalypse has made the air outside toxic. That's all you need to know, that's all you want to know. So, let's get into my review...while sidestepping pretty much everything about it.<br/><br/>First of all I have to give props to the director, Dan Trachtenberg; you've not heard of him? That's because this is his first feature film. I mean seriously, I hope this guy goes on to have a long and successful career. 10 Cloverfield Lane does not look cheap or amateur in any way despite only having about a $15,000,000 budget; he really only had three rooms to film in so it made for some really claustrophobic and uncomfortable moments, and even with a limited setting don't be surprised if your heart starts beating a little faster and tense up. As a summary of my introduction to Dan Trachtenberg: I think he's going places.<br/><br/>Acting-wise; wow. John Goodman plays 'unstable' exceptionally well; when he's around you're trying to work him out and figure what his deal is and when he wasn't on screen I was just thinking ""Where is he. Where is he"". Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic as well as this woman who suddenly wakes up not knowing where she is or what's going on; but she wasn't some helpless wimp, she had a bit of knowledge which I think made things realistic. John Gallagher Jr. did well in his role as well; I'm not familiar with his work but he did absolutely fine as his character Emmet. So on an acting front I can't really fault it.<br/><br/>Now with the plot, I'm not going to spoil anything because I think the less you know before going in then the more you'll enjoy it but if you're hesitant because you haven't seen 2008's found- footage film Cloverfield which has been called ""a blood relative"" or something, don't worry at all; while a connection is plausible 10 Cloverfield Lane is completely stand-alone. The narrative of this movie itself I think is very rare but utilises some familiar imagery which make for a thrilling experience because you do not know what's coming next.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, I really enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane and it's refreshing to see this sort of originality and an upcoming director."
"Halloween4","7","4","6","23 March 2016"," Interestingly Different
","Although '10 Cloverfield lane' has been package as a late sequel to 2008's Si-fi movie 'Cloverfield', this is by far a different breed of movie. In-fact on watching this movie you can't help but get the feeling that the movie studio's had only added the 'Cloverfield 'tag in an effort to attract more of a audience for this interestingly different Si-fi/horror movie, as they didn't know what they were dealing with in terms of their audience. This is also reflected by the fact that the movie has also been rated with a 12A certificate which somehow seems like another attempt by the film studio's to bring in a wider audience, but they needn't have bothered on both accounts as this movie is a little gem that would have stood out on its own whatever its title.<br/><br/>However, adding the 'Cloverfield 'tag kind of spoilt the movie for me to a large degree as the mystery of what exactly was going on in the movie had already been shattered by the fact that I knew that the first movie was about an Alien invasion, but you would have to go see this movie to see exactly where I'm coming from there.<br/><br/>When I said that this is by far a different breed of movie from its predecessor, I meant that in a good way also, as gone is that annoying hand-held camera found footage fad, and the amateurish acting that made the first movie such a chore to watch, to be replace with steady camera angles and Stella acting (most notably from 'John Goodman' who gives a very menacing performance).<br/><br/>The special 'Alien' affects in the movie are also very well done, although you only get to see them in the last 20 minutes of the movie. I also noted however, that the Aliens in this movie looked nothing like thoughts in the previous movie, which kind of adds to the point that I was trying to make in my opening paragraph.<br/><br/>As for the 12A certificate, well hardened Si-fi/horror fans needn't worry as this movie (although lacking in blood and gore), has a few well place jump scares that will please most audience members.<br/><br/>Also note, that 90% of this movie is set in an underground bunker, which gives this movie a very claustrophobic atmosphere which only goes to add to the tension of the situation that the characters find themselves in. This is the kind of atmosphere I love in my Si-fi/Horror movies, i.e. 1979's Alien, or 1982's The Thing for example.<br/><br/>The movie itself wasn't without its faults i.e I sometimes found myself thinking, well that's stretching things a bit, but all-in-all the movie was (like I've already said), interestingly different and very entertaining, and a breath of fresh air to the Si-fi/horror movie genre."
"PyroSikTh","8","4","6","22 March 2016"," Intense from beginning to end
","Like everyone else, I was taken by complete surprise when the movie was announced less than two months ago with a trailer and everything. No-one knew it even existed until then, and it's sudden appearance brought on a whole host of questions. The film's ultimate lure was by not telling you anything, and remaining mysterious. That was enough for me to get more excited about this movie than that big blockbuster featuring one of my favourite characters released at the end of the week. Just a note on spoilers, I avoid spoiling anything as best I can, and make efforts to hide anything major, but you are warned that this movie is best enjoyed knowing nothing.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a movie that encourages you to constantly question what you see and what you're told. It throws twists and turns at you from all angles, sometimes suddenly, out of the blue, to loud and shocking results. To say that 10 Cloverfield Lane is unpredictable is an understatement. Things just unexpectedly happen from the very offset, and you're never sure what or when something is going to happen next. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and off- balance. For as many questions as it poses, it makes sure all the major ones are answered by the movie's end. However the story's only real fault is with it's climax. Even when knowing about the movie's external context, and taking note of the hints and clues subtly laid out in the build up, the ending still comes off as a bit far-fetched. While it does play as a little ironic, it just feels completely out-of-place with the tone and direction of the rest of the film that precedes it.<br/><br/>Being a movie that largely takes place in an underground bunker, it's entertainment value is entirely reliant on the dialogue and the acting work. Thankfully, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a massive success in both regards. Mary Elizabeth Winstead brings her A-game as Michelle. After a car accident, she finds herself chained to the wall of an underground bunker and told that the surface is unsafe due to chemical or nuclear attacks. Winstead plays her suitably suspicious and distrusting. She's even a little manipulative over her cohabiters to ensure she can not only find the truth, but also live to tell the tale. She often holds her suspicions and fears just beneath the surface. John Gallagher Jr. is also pretty good as Emmett, the other, younger guy in the bunker. He's not too sharp, but Gallagher doesn't play him as a complete idiot (you never go full retard). He's a funny guy with a soul and good heart, and his character brings a much needed lightheartedness to the otherwise claustrophobic and grim tone of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>However, even amongst such great performances from his co-stars, John Goodman shines like a shiny diamond. It's easy to forget how good an actor he really is, but 10 Cloverfield Lane is here to remind us. As Howard, the conspiracy nut who built the bunker. With a history in the Navy and working with satellites for a certain Japanese company, it's easy to understand where his conspiracy stance may stem from, and lays the seeds that he might actually be right. Besides, Goodman plays him like an older version of a thirty year-old who lives in his mum's basement. This gives him a creepy and anti-social persona that puts you on edge towards his true intentions. However he injects enough humanity and soul into the performance that Howard is more than just an antagonist. He's sympathetic enough that he could be genuine and just misunderstood. You feel Howard has a full and deep history just from Goodman's performance alone.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, almost forgot, what's it's relation to Cloverfield? No idea. At this point with JJ Abrams, it's hard to tell if he's narratively connecting movies together, or just putting the same easter eggs and references into them for fun and to watch the internet explode. There's a strong theory supporting the subtle sequel idea, but there's also a few points that just fly in the face of any outright continuity. Ultimately, you'll just have to see it and judge for yourself, but either way 10 Cloverfield Lane stands perfectly fine by itself without relying on any other movie.<br/><br/>I won't rattle on too long (I don't think I could without delving too much into spoiler territory), so I'll leave it there and keep it concise and short. It's a tense thriller that will plunge you into eternal suspense, driven by complex characters and spectacular performances. I give it a very good 8/10 (although subsequent rewatches may well bump it up a bit; it's a movie that begs to be watched more than once)."

","Claustrophobia is a quite common theme in horror movies. So how to make a good horror movie by manipulating the elements of claustrophobia? In 10 Cloverfield Lane Josh Campbell presented you the smart way to do it.<br/><br/>a. Physical discomfort.<br/><br/>Car accident, PTSD, Milleche (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) 's first reaction was hysteria but natural as an injured woman in her position. I was driven bit nuts and blamed her for a while when every evidence in that small space pointing to the fact she's such a paranoia, and I was very close to believe she's going to get everyone killed as an ungrateful silly woman. <br/><br/>But there's always something in her got my attention that I simply could be sure that she was a black sheep.<br/><br/>Josh Campbell knew better.<br/><br/>b. Strangers' secrets.<br/><br/>Are people really who they claimed to be and can they be trusted?<br/><br/>When you are in no position to question the authority of the leader in the small survivors group, what can you do will get you to your own destiny.<br/><br/>Michelle had to trust Howard to survive. And you can tell from her first instinct, she did not trust the old man at all. Her first illusion bubble burst by the deformed woman from the other side of the mirror. Howard was not lying about the air. Then came the flash in her blurred memory triggered her suspicion. Again, I was led this way to follow a natural explanation of her suspicion. Howard was no saint, he's only a heartbroken father. Then he should be forgiven considering the situation there.<br/><br/>Until the loser looking Emmett pointed out the girl in the picture was not who she was claimed by Howard, the truth really started to turn everything from bad to worse.<br/><br/>c. Prey in the cage.<br/><br/>Toxic air outside, alien hunters with their super power weapons and spacecrafts, meanwhile, inside, underground, a hentai human hunter who had every skill and source to survive and he was getting what he wanted, you, in the corner. <br/><br/>I was shocked to see Emmett's sudden death. It's totally out of the prediction loop. Although everyone knows that in a horror movie unpredictable death is the common trick to scare audiences. Josh did a really great job to tell a common story in a brilliant way.<br/><br/>d. Hope.<br/><br/>I googled Josh Campbell and seeing him did Narnia explained the warm-wished ending of the film. Personally speaking I like it. Yes we polluted the Earth and any form of apocalypse is what we deserve. However, there's human will and there's always hope hidden in the bottom of Pandora's box. We do learn from our mistakes and we are capable to make a better world, especially when there's alien invasions, facing a common enemy is so much more easier than facing other human beings. Trust me, I'm Chinese, I know how tricky and twisted you and I would turn to be when we are against each other. Joking...or not."
"roblov1","8","4","6","10 March 2016"," Short review and no spoilers.
","This movie started with a preliminary title called The Cellar and it would've been a fantastic name for the film. <br/><br/>It's dark, creepy, bordering on claustrophobic where every moment keeps you in a state of near tension as to what is going to happen next. <br/><br/>I cannot state how impressive John Goodman is in this film. His acting range is beyond that of almost any I can think of at the moment. He is absolutely captivating every time he's on film and every time you begin to think you understand his motivations, you're wrong. <br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead is excellent in her role. She in a tough position as the protagonist and needs to carry herself against the dominating presence of Goodman. She is capable and adapts well as her situation changes.<br/><br/>John Gallagher Jr. is just plain likable. He's a good foil for the other actors and it's a chance for him to expand his name recognition.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, I'm going to be deliberately vague as I don't want to spoil anything. The movie keeps the tension level up without fail and the minutes fly by. I recommend trying to know as little as possible before going in to seeing the film as the twists are a necessary part of the drama. <br/><br/>Overall, the film is highly recommended. Just experience the tension, the fantastic acting and enjoy the ride."
"jewshpah89","9","4","6","10 March 2016"," Do yourself a favour and see 10 Cloverfield Lane
","When 10 Cloverfield Lane was announced a few months ago, I had the same reaction that everybody else did: what the hell is this and how have I not heard about it before?<br/><br/>When rumours broke that it was just a regular movie that was slapped with the Cloverfield brand in post production for marketing hype, I was less than thrilled. I expected a very cynical cash grab. <br/><br/>I am incredibly grateful to have been proved wrong. <br/><br/>First things first, this is NOT a sequel to the 2008 Cloverfield. It is a standalone film in its own universe. Like the original, 10 Cloverfield Lane crosses between horror and science fiction, with a very strong psychological thriller element throughout. <br/><br/>If you were expecting a direct sequel, complete with the Clover monster and the creepy parasites, I'm afraid you'll be rather disappointed. <br/><br/>I admit that it was wrong of Bad Robot to never come out and explain what the film really is. Throwing around terms like ""blood relative"" or ""spiritual successor"" just caused more confusion and imbued a false sense of hope that the original monster would show up at the end. <br/><br/>SPOILERS... he does not.<br/><br/>However, what you will get instead is a brilliantly crafted film with the perfect tone. It honestly gave me one of the most enjoyable theatre experiences I've had in years. <br/><br/>When it's meant to be scary, it's scary. When it's meant to be funny, it's funny. And when it's meant to be balls out crazy, it's balls out crazy. I was smiling the whole way through, loving every second. <br/><br/>The performances were terrific. John Gallagher, Jr gave Emmett the right kind of charisma with a genuine thoughtfulness. <br/><br/>As I'm sure everyone has heard by now, John Goodman was exceptional. His role as Howard was incredibly gripping, intense and also lighthearted. Walking the fine line between sane and insane, Goodman never faltered and kept the audience guessing who the character really was.<br/><br/>The real standout here was Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who channelled Sigourney Weaver in Alien during the entire film. Her ability to show genuine fear, confusion, cleverness and strength made her character instantly likable and relatable. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm worried that the title will hurt the film's success. I loved the movie from beginning to end and I'm a fan of the proposed ""Cloverfield anthology series"", but it would have been safer to keep the original working title of ""The Cellar"" to avoid any misunderstanding. <br/><br/>From a business perspective, having Cloverfield in the name would generate significant buzz and probably bring in greater box office numbers. <br/><br/>However, if word of mouth spreads that it's not ""Cloverfield 2"", angry fans could avoid seeing it out of spite. <br/><br/>But I'm imploring you... just because this is not Cloverfield 2 doesn't mean you shouldn't see it. It's a great movie that subverts your predictions, surpasses expectations and never stops being entertaining. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and see 10 Cloverfield Lane."

"jrarichards","10","7","14","11 May 2016"," WOW! Remember what films were supposed to be like? You soon will!
","As usual taking advantage of cheap Wednesday tickets, I relaxed in a not-very-full cinema to first enjoy the trailer for the long-awaited follow-up to ""Independence Day"" - a film I really loved. Hence I'm awaiting stage 2 with considerable anticipation - though also a bit of trepidation. I say this to make it clear that I've nothing whatever against many big-budget, special effects-packed films. But take away a zero or more from that and you get the intelligent and tense gem that is ""Cloverfield Lane 10"".<br/><br/>Normally I like including spoiling aspects, as it makes for a more fun analysis of a film, but here I'm deliberately a bit more circumspect. There is a lot to be enjoyed here, and more when one knows less...<br/><br/>This film is a little bit like two films tacked together, and it's paradoxical that you surely can ""see the join"", almost glaringly so. Yet there would be limited satisfaction without both aspects. So that's the first bit of ""edge"". The second - huge - bit comes with our 3 heroes stuck in a bunker which one is the brains behind and a total control freak clearly a bit unhinged, one is the builder of, but otherwise a bit ineffectual, and one is off the street completely; there entirely by chance. This gives the perfect frame for the ""relevant knowledge and insight"" that are a huge part of this film.<br/><br/>How bad really is the catastrophe they've gone underground to escape? Is there one at all? We are kept guessing, and the man with the fullest insight, holding most of the cards, is farmer-survivalist and ex US Navy man Howard. That's the part taken by John Goodman, and boy does he ever earn his fee! Personally, I've never seen him do better. The other (younger and less able) guy down there below ground is Emmett (played by John Gallagher Jr). With the best will in the world, this is not an especially demanding part, but it's very necessary in the context of the film, as we are made to realise extremely vividly.<br/><br/>Then our female lead is Michelle, sumptuously rendered by the excellent Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Now, by the second scene we are alerted to the fact that Michelle is a very nice-looking young woman. But she's not maybe quite a beauty queen, let's say. BUT... But... in Winstead's hands she comes over as such a resourceful, determined, gutsy person, almost a force of nature, that the more feisty and capable she becomes, the more sexy she appears! What a woman! It's really an impressive and superb transformation, but it's by no means the film's only one. Goodman's Howard goes up and down in our estimation like a yo-yo and it's great work. And when our triangle of characters get a bit settled in, and begin to mellow and get used to each other a little, it is quite surprising how tangibly and desperately we out here in the cinema are willing them on to make a go of it. And in this ocean of seriousness there are some remarkable lighter moments, when it really does look as if they might be able to ride out the storm for the 1-2 years Howard thinks it's going to take...<br/><br/>How three mismatched losers become winners and try to work together despite huge tension in the air... It's elemental, focused, claustrophobic, interesting, exciting, unpredictable film-making from Dan Trachtenberg and the writers. So much nuance, fear and, yes, fun out of apparently so little! There are numerous scares along the way, but a lot more besides about human nature; and also plenty of subliminal stuff about the true meaning of freedom and security.<br/><br/>As I've mentioned, we do get a reasonable number of answers after our patient wait (and even a beautiful and touching vignette of humankind-and-nature stuff much appreciated). So - thank goodness - the ""leave them wanting more"" approach that many Directors seem to regard as art (rather than the torture and frustration it often appears to the audience) was eschewed. But - guess what? I STILL wanted more. They could have added another 20 to the 103 we got and it would have been all to the good. Ah well, nothing is quite perfect, but Cloverfield Lane comes pretty close as a piece of the film-maker's art.<br/><br/>For sci fi fans it's a must-see of hugely effective minimalism, but I would hazard a guess there's many a ""normal person"" out there who would also appreciate this piece of crisp, well-acted, hyper-tense drama.<br/><br/>Very well done!"
"ironhorse_iv","7","7","14","22 March 2016"," Let's get down to it. 10 Cloverfield Lane was alright, but a bit misleading as a sequel.
","2016's 10 Cloverfield Lane is a remarkable debut movie for director Dan Trachtenberg. While its budget is smaller than 2008's Cloverfield, it is no less effective in its ability to scare its audience with the film unnerve physiological horror. The movie tells the story of Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a woman who just survived a car crash, only to wake up, being locked in a small fallout shelter, deep underground with a man named Howard (John Goodman) and his contractor, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) for her own safety. It's seems, that there has been a chemical attack, while she was knocked out, and the air outside the bunker is now toxic. Does Michelle believe what the men are saying about the world outside, or will the uneasiness of their presence, make living in the bunker, impossible? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, this gripping thriller works, best, because of the great performances from these three actors in the limited space. It almost seem like a dialogue masterpiece of Broadway stage. This is in large part thanks to John Goodman, who delivers a career-high performance here as Howard Stambler. I love how genuinely resourceful, Goodman is with his role. Goodman's character is so complex and elusive that you can't help finding something off-putting about Howard, no matter, how nice, he acts. I also, love how much, Goodman's towers over his co-stars, Winstead and Gallagher, both in height and bulk. He really seem authorized and commanding. This movie show us, that humans along us can be just as frightening as the monsters, you don't see. Gallagher's lackadaisical southern presence adds a much-needed warmth to the otherwise frictional environment. He wasn't annoying to me, like some critics make him, out to be; because I love how Emmett acts like the moral compass of the piece, by revealing his fears and allow himself to find the strength to act to save others. Then, there is Winstead whom is a standout lead. Her character is a welcome antidote to the idiocy of the characters in the original Cloverfield. She's not a damsel in distress; but one of the resourceful, intelligent, and determined heroines in recent memory. I like how, Michelle starts the movie running away from her problems, only for the end of the film, to have the courage to face the monsters that live in her world. It was amazing character development. However, there are a few things that I didn't like about this film, such as the movie being market as a spiritual predecessor to the 2008 found-footage monster flick; when in truth, it has very little in common with that film. Yes, the marketing ploy did drive audiences to see the film based on the assumption of the name, but it's still false advertising, no matter, how you put it. The movie originally was a script called 'The Cellar', written by Josh Campbell & Matt Stuecken. Once producer, JJ Abrams's production company, Bad Robot got the script, it was rewritten into a 'spiritual successor' to Cloverfield. Because of that, they change the strong and realistic ending of the original strong script, into a silly and forced anti-climax end. It was very inconsistent. It felt like, I was watching a different film in the later part of the film. I would have loved the movie if it ended with her walking into the night with her suit on into an uncertain future, rather than the rip-off 'war of the worlds' premise. Honestly, I wouldn't mind, this approached to this sequel, if the producers told the public, that 10 Cloverfield Lane would be anthology series of horror movies with each film containing its own characters, setting, and story. Something similar to Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, or Tales of the Crypt, TV Shows. Better yet, something similar to what 1982's Halloween: Season of the Witch was trying to do with the Halloween franchise. It would make more sense! Since, they didn't do that, a lot of fans of the 2008 movie were very disappointed, that this sequel didn't continue with the Kaiju attack of the first movie. There isn't even any acknowledgement that the events of the first film even happened at all. It's a rough shift for them to take. Pretty drastic turn from monster movie to unique ""kidnapping"" crime drama. Still, this movie is mostly a genuinely well-shot film that knew how to handle tension quite well. I like how 10 Cloverfield Lane wisely abandoned the lame found footage gimmick, and shaking camera. It's a lot more intense by being a psychological thriller. I just wish, that claustrophobic thriller/suspense part, was a little more draw-out; because there were a few things, I wish the movie would explain more, like why Howard didn't designed an air filtration control room, he can fit in? Better yet, what were the reasons, why Howard allow Emmett to stay there, if he can't stand him? Overall: I did enjoyed this movie even with its flaws. So, I recommended it. Get out of your shelter life and go see this movie! You will like it."

","As a big fan of the original film, I did a little geek-squeal when the trailer for this one appeared out of nowhere!<br/><br/>I'm delighted to say this didn't disappoint at all. The story was gripping and kept me guessing throughout, and all three leads were spot on - Goodman firing on all cylinders, and Winstead perfectly striking the balance between terrified and gutsy.<br/><br/>The film's biggest strength, however, is also the chink in its armour: the first ¾ of the film is played for such grim realism that some people find the last section a little hard to swallow.

"TheLastBaronW","10","5","9","3 April 2016"," Thrilling, unsettling, exciting - with a twist at the end!
","Seeing really good movies is rare these days. Lots of remakes, some of them wholly unjustified, and lots of really bad movies, too. So when something that exceeds the original comes along as a sort-of sequel, it's a pleasure.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane was a total surprise. I liked the original Cloverfield a lot, even if the actual pictures of aliens attacking were very distant and disappointing, yet the action was great and so was the edginess, the hand-held camera, the priceless shot of Lady Liberty's head rolling down the avenue in New York.<br/><br/>How to follow that and make it even better? 10 Cloverfield Lane. The basic premise is simple - a woman is run off the road by a large pick up after a scary encounter at an eerily dark gas station in the middle of nowhere. We don't know much about her except that she has just run away from her husband/boyfriend/partner and is just driving to escape. And yet, she picks up the mobile when he calls, which is ultimately her undoing. <br/><br/>Sideswiped into a deep ravine. Next, she awakens chained to a wall, attached to a medical drip, in a bleak cellar, not understanding where she is, blood-matted hair and on a mattress on the ground.<br/><br/>Enter John Goodman in one of his best roles ever - he's the scary ""dungeon master,"" who insists he rescued her after the car wreck and brought her to his lair to nurse her back to health... although he doesn't tell her of his ulterior and ultimate motives, which are not hard to guess...<br/><br/>But the pot thickens with the introduction of another inhabitant of Goodman's lair... one who tells our main protagonist that the world outside is contaminated, possibly destroyed. Goodman compounds the tale, and when a CB radio is seen in what turns out to be an incredibly well-stocked underground nuclear fallout shelter they are all sharing, she never tries to contact the outside world on it after being told by Goodman that he's tried and it is all to no avail.<br/><br/>The plot develops with some immensely interesting personality traits that are just plain weird and eerie. As soon as you settle into believing that Goodman's character is a complete pervert, a murderer and more, along comes her escape and the connection to the original Cloverfield, but this time we get to see the aliens up close. And ugly they are, too.<br/><br/>Enough said, go see it. You won't be sorry. And the door's been left open for a sequel, which I do hope gets made and I look forward to."

","I'm a film snob, and admit I didn't expect much from this after being so disappointed in it's predecessor. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>Easily, this is the best psychological thriller to come along in in years. John Goodman is a absolute genius, and his performance rivals even the most iconic ones in modern cinema. I am not typically reactive to films, given that I've seen the goriest of the gory and am resistant to the shock scare tactic that lesser films leverage to make you jump.That didn't happen here. This film leveraged your emotions.<br/><br/>This film gave me anxiety, it had me literally nervous. Very rarely does a film come along with such a great concept that it leaves the viewer incapable of predicting the results or consequences, but this hit the mark on every single level. It entertained, provoked a reaction, and had me completely invested from beginning to end.<br/><br/>THIS is what filmmaking is about. This shows that Hollywood is still capable of original concepts and clever stories rather than just recycling comic book superheroes over and over again. In a better world, John Goodman would get an Oscar for his gripping performance because there hasn't been anyone come close to the talent he demonstrated throughout. Never boring, always unfolding, this was simply masterful cinema."
"lwood28","9","5","9","25 March 2016"," One of the Best Thrillers of 2016
","10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the best thrillers of 2016 so far. One note I would like to say is that this is not a sequel to the original Cloverfield. The film could take place in the same universe in Cloverfield but this is not a sequel. Also if your suspecting the Cloverfield monster to be in this film, your going to be disappointed. This film is a drama, and tense film with some horror elements in it. The acting in the film is great but the one person that stood out the most was John Goodman. He is one of the most underrated actors working in Hollywood today. I believe John Goodman is Oscar-worthy for his performance. This is Dan Trachtenberg's first film he has ever directed and I can't wait to see what he brings in the future. The film also does have an amazing score from Bear McCreary. One other thing a really liked about this film is the sound. The only negative I can say about this film is the ending. The ending felt rushed. The mystery in the film keeps you hooked until the very end and then near the end it felt okay but, this is a film that needs to be viewed a second time. Overall if your a fan of thrillers or very tense films then this is for you. And if they plan on making an anthology with this movie then I'm excited to see what they do next."
"RodrigAndrisan","10","5","9","21 March 2016"," Smart and original
","It is not easy to make a film with only three characters, enclosed in a bunker below ground and not to be boring. 10 Cloverfield Lane (I would rename it 10 Cleverfield Lane...) not only is not boring but, finally, after so many bad movies, it's a very good special one. It has a real gradual tension, until the unexpected but so natural end. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is perfect in the role of Michelle and John Goodman is impeccable. Exceptional the extremely brief appearance of Suzanne Cryer in the role of The Woman. Very persuasive monster and alien ship. Original and smart main titles too. Worth seeing at least the second time, for a second tasting and enjoyment. 10 out of 10."

","This movie shocked everyone when they found out about it... 2 months ago and now it's finally here. Cloverfield (2008) feels like it was yesterday when it hit theaters riding on the back of the found footage film type. Without spoiling the movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is not a sequel and really feels like it's in the same universe but maybe different galaxies.<br/><br/>Right from the get-go, the film holds you in suspense. After the car accident, you are fondled into the claustrophobic bomb shelter with two men who claim the outside world was infected with a widespread chemical attack. But when things go from bad to worse in the bomb shelter. Tensions rise as you begin to finish the jigsaw puzzle of how Michelle got down into the shelter (Reference to the movie). However the ending to me was a let down.<br/><br/>Before I begin on the ending, yes I know that opinions are divided. A love it or hate it type ending. The story-line up until this point has been masterwork. Original screenplay and story-line has made you expect something a whole lot more from this tasteless ending. Perhaps the only problem made in this movie was that they tied it to Cloverfield (2008) as the clichés of every action thriller begin to appear. (Wont spoil anything). Everything went well until this point and I feel as though if they took a step in the opposite direction by exploring the roots of specific characters more and maybe even seeing the clover we all know and love from Cloverfield (2008) other than this bland, unoriginal excuse for an antagonist we see in this film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie is full of twists and surprises that not all films get right. 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) does get this right. Although a different ending should be apparent instead of a money grabbing ending setting the Cloverfield franchise up for future get-rich-quick type movies from this cult favorite movie. Just like other cult favorites, they have to be treated carefully and I found they did not for this film's ending.<br/><br/>Thanks"
"ryanmark-57919","10","5","9","17 March 2016"," This is so Much Better than the First One
","Is it just me or did this movie come completely out of nowhere? I remember hearing about a Cloverfield sequel and I was immediately surprised but at the same time intrigued. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't a fan of the first Cloverfield movie. It just didn't work for me for a variety of reasons but I was still curious to see what the sequel/spin-off/completely unrelated film had to offer. I'm glad I gave this one a chance because I think this movie is fantastic. Maybe it was the low expectations but this film is so good that I now want to see more Cloverfield sequels (to this one, not the other one) but they probably won't be as good without John Goodman. Anyway, Dan Trachtenberg did a great job with this one and let's talk about it a little bit.<br/><br/>Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is leaving home after having a fight with her husband but we don't really learn the particulars behind this squabble. Michelle is very upset about it though and keeps looking at her cellphone and is soon caught in a terrible accident that totals her car and leaves her trapped inside of a bunker with a strange man named Howard (John Goodman) and another occupant named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). Howard takes her here because of a plague of some kind that has left humanity devastated. Howard seems to have good intentions but Michelle soon finds out that he's more than a little unhinged and she and Emmett are in more danger down there than they are outside.<br/><br/>There's a pretty small cast in this film but that just means these characters shine all the more. Winstead is fantastic as the resilient and resourceful Michelle. She's obviously terrified of all the craziness going on around her but she always finds a way out of her increasingly crappy situations. John Gallagher Jr. also does a great job as the nice guy Emmett. This is the kind of guy that wouldn't hurt anyone and acts as a nice counter to the unhinged Howard. Speaking of Howard, John Goodman absolutely nails this role and easily steals every scene he's in. This guy is terrifying in every way. Everything from his seemingly childish tantrums to his imposing physical presence is just unsettling. I don't want to spoil too much but he's easily more terrifying than what's going on outside, and that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>The atmosphere to this film is very claustrophobic which makes sense seeing as how it takes place in an underground bunker but it also helps to make the movie that much more unsettling and creepy. We're led to believe early on that whatever is going on outside is fatal but it's hard not to wish the characters would just get out of there. It's unreal just how scary Goodman is in this role. There's also an awesome Shyamalan level twist at the end of the film that just brings the craziness to a whole other level.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no complaints to make about this movie. The performances are great, the atmosphere is creepy and unsettling, and the story is pretty weird but it's also a ton of fun. I don't know if this is supposed to be a sequel or what but I know that this is easily the better of the two films and I hope that they use this format for any future movies in the franchise. I can't recommend this one enough. Go watch it!"
"jonathanhigh5-1","10","5","9","15 March 2016"," Best Movie I Have Seen in the Theater in a Long While!
","Pure escapism. I'm a big sci-fiction fan so perhaps I'm a little biased. This movie proves that Hollywood still has original ideas, not a lot but still has some. It kept me guessing all the way until the end and never did it seem to drag or dwell on any one topic. Our protagonist becomes trapped with John Goodman and John Gallagher for an indeterminate amount of time because of a supposed attack outside. What we are given is a psychological guessing game between what's real and what's not. John Goodman is extra creepy in this one, probably manic depressive, as he keeps his two guests trapped with little means to escape. It's a little depressing towards the end but without giving too much away, the movie goes full out sci-fi at the film's conclusion. I definitely recommend this to anyone that enjoys thrillers, even if they're not necessarily a Star Wars or Aliens fan. As opposed to it's predecessor, Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield is 90% psychological. I loved it and hope you will too!"

","What a thrill! If you love films that keep you on the edge of your seat, 10 Cloverfield Lane will not disappoint! This is not a sequel to the 2008 alien attack movie Cloverfield, but like that film, it leaves you terrified! This films tells the story of Michelle, played by Elizabeth Winstead, who is a young woman that runs out on her fiancé and while driving is run off the road. She awakens in a room with the man who saved her, played by John Goodman. Goodman tells the girl that he is keeping her safe underground from a nuclear desert. She doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Is he her savior or captor? <br/><br/>Director Dan Trachtenberg did an outstanding job creating this thrilling sensation and frantic fear! His previous work consists of only commercials and short films, but he seems to do quite well with full length films! He keeps the film clear to understand while including suspense throughout. New coming writers Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken deserve as much credit as Trachtenberg; they did a phenomenal job on the screen writing and setting of each scene. John Goodman also did an incredible job as the 'weirdo' and never lets the audience down with his superb acting skills! With great suspense, sound, and visuals, this film is a definite must see!"

","When the film was first announced, there was a lot of speculation on how it was possible for J.J to create a sequel to Cloverfield in absolute secrecy, the short answer is, he didn't. The film started off as a movie titled 'The Cellar' the script was then bought by J.J's Bad Robot production studio and reworked into the movie we have today. Now the movie itself is a psychological thriller that takes place in an underground bunker created by a man named Howard (John Goodman's character) he finds a girl named Michelle (MEW) who he found in the wreckage of a car crash. As the movie progresses, she slowly starts to question if Howard is telling the truth about the outside world being unsustainable. Which leads to her and Emmet (JGJ) to attempt a break out. All three actors do a fantastic job, especially John Goodman, and you can't help but empathize with all of them in some way.

","I was so excited to watch this movie because of the glowing reviews by users as well as critics, many saying that there is a ""surprise"" ending. Well, it's not really a surprise when half way through the movie Howard suggests it might be aliens, and it IS aliens. I was expecting something like, Emmett was actually an alien, so comes back to life and kills them both.<br/><br/>So we get to see the alien in the last 10 minutes of the movie. It picks up the car with Michelle in it, and instead of killing her instantly, it holds her up there, while she's got a Molotov cocktail flaming in her hand for a good 20 seconds or so, so she can time it perfectly and throw it into it's mouth. seriously, why is this alien just staring at her with it's mouth opening and closing?

","While I didn't see the original Cloverfield until relatively recently, I understand that it had one of the most inventive and memorable marketing campaigns of this generation. 10 Cloverfield Lane decided to do a similar thing but this time have the plot of the film stay under wraps besides a few minor details in trailers. It was one of the few times I can remember where I went into a movie knowing borderline nothing. For the day and age we live in now where trailers spoil more than half the film? That was refreshing to say the least.<br/><br/>I'm going to try and keep the details of the plot to a minimum as I dissect this unsettling thriller. The first film is very much an adventure horror film. It really perfected the found footage take on making a film and may be the last great one we have had (besides Chronicle). 10 Cloverfield Lane is much more in the mystery vain than anything else. We follow Michelle, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as she finds herself locked up in a cell with a few other people played by John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr without any knowledge of what's going on outside this place.<br/><br/>If you were looking for a direct sequel to Cloverfield, this film may disappoint you. There are very little links at all to the first film, but it turned out for the better. For the most part, I didn't want to see any direct links to the first film, I was so invested in what was going on between the 3 characters back at this supposed safe house. John Goodman is very good as Howard, and that's all I'll say because you can't really say anything else without spoiling anything.<br/><br/>The real highlight of the film comes from Winstead's strong performance. I've seen her in a few things but none that really blew me away. She was astounding as Michelle and yet another example of a capable and strong female character, something Hollywood should keep up. Bear McCreary's haunting score fits perfectly within the tone and it hits at just the right time with the film's up and down pacing. If I had an issue with the film, it would in fact be pacing. This film starts out fast but it does slow down for a long time before a thrilling final 30 minutes or so.<br/><br/>For a first time directing, I was very impressed with Dan Trachtenberg's work here. He captured the feel of the first movie and put his own stamp on it at the same time. The minimal marketing is something I would like to see more of in Hollywood as it proved to be very effective.

","After a bitter fight with her fiancé, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) packs a bag and rushes off in her car. When her vehicle is suddenly hit and veers off the road, she loses consciousness only to awake a short time later chained to a wall in a desolate concrete room. Her captor introduces himself as Howard (John Goodman) and informs the petrified young girl that he has not kidnapped her, but actually saved her life from a devastating attack by foreign forces that has made the outside world no longer habitable. As Michelle is slowly allowed to explore the fallout bunker that is now her home, she begins to suspect that Howard has not been truthful about their situation or his intentions.<br/><br/>The music really sets the tone for this peculiar little thriller. Seemingly innocuous events are immediately ominous when Bear McCreary's sensationally skin-crawling notes begin plucking at nerves. And it leads to a forceful, shocking title sequence, unmasking the ""Cloverfield"" name as well as a subtle reference to ""10 Rillington Place,"" an obscure British crime drama based on an actual serial killer.<br/><br/>But therein lies the problem with ""10 Cloverfield Lane."" It's quite obviously two separate pictures: an unnerving cat-and-mouse game in a claustrophobic, perpetually suspicious, downright scary environment - and producer J.J. Abrams' independent influence on what was clearly a straightforward (but not without twisty moments of surprise), reality-based mystery. Had the two concepts been integrated proportionally, or perhaps if the traumatic revelations appeared in a different order, the fusion of incompatible elements could have been acceptable - or even uncommonly creative. Instead, audiences will be left with a feeling of incongruous projects getting warped together, solely to capitalize on the name recognition of the title to boost the viewership of what was, all by itself, a completely competent thriller.<br/><br/>""I'm sorry, but no one is looking for you."" It may look like a simple premise, but this three-person show is a nicely deceitful, wily character study and chilling adventure. Goodman is perfectly creepy as the abductor, who induces unwavering apprehension while harboring just a hint of neighborly concern (or perverse familial preservation). When his deceptively good intentions lean toward something along the lines of Stockholm syndrome-grooming, Winstead (and John Gallagher Jr. in a convincing turn) takes the spotlight as a proactive fighter resourcefully scrounging for clues or defense. Peppered with small bouts of comedy to calm audiences just long enough to rattle them with the next affright, the pacing is keen and the abundance of unknowns keeps things entertainingly agitating. The cinematography is also well used to cheat the visibility of dangers just offscreen. But by the end, despite successfully jangling nerves and generating roller-coaster horrors, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" can't escape the sense that an enormously unrelated story has been repurposed for the sake of marketability.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Massie Twins</li></ul>"

","Many times, the soundtrack of a movie will be described as a separate character, a unique presence in a movie that operates with its own set of acting and performance skills. This is exemplified by Bear McCreary's fantastic soundtrack here.<br/><br/>The soundtrack works fully as an omniscient point of view, in which a narrator knows the thoughts and feelings of all of the characters in the story. McCreary uses his well-developed arsenal of musical devices to predict and react to the action in this movie, but at the same time sticks with the simple, haunting theme.<br/><br/>Sometimes soundtracks can be obnoxious and intrusive, but this one dovetails so well into the story it is a fourth character, equally as dazzling as the other three performers. Certainly, Bear's experience with video game soundtracks, as well as his studies with composer Elmer Bernstein, himself a composer of hundreds of film scores, has provided us with a textbook version of what a soundtrack can do."

","This is the first movie I am watching in 2016 and I wish others makes me satisfied like it . first the movie combines two major lines in the story . it is not only about a group of people that go to shelter underground and suffer there from what happens outside but there is also another trouble within keeps you in doubt all over the movie . the casting did a great job in representing their characters especially John Goodman who played the role of very mysterious man who have a history that we want to know and the director gives you small information in every scene about him which counted as a good advantage of the script of the movie . the movie deals with the characters inside and we saw the main character Mary Elizabeth who cant face her problems and that makes her feel bad about herself . this experience learns her to go beyond this and encourage her a lot which take the movie to another level and free her so I was watching a solid written characters with a lot to say without even talking . the music is OK and suitable for anxiety that covers the mode . dialogue is one the best elements of the movie . it delivers what it want simply in a few words . direction also is good and I liked the details made in the shelter and the director concentrate on the particular subject of the movie which sounds comfortable for me . the only thing that bothers me in 10 cloverfield lane was that the last 15 minutes was pretty good and it should continue a little bet to be more convincing and to give an obvious evidence for the danger attacking the country .<br/><br/>10 cloverfield lane is interesting movie from the beginning to the end and you will not regret watching it ."

If it weren't for Goodman this would be a 5/10.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately there are enough points in the story where things happen or characters do things in order to let the story progress, but that make little to no sense in the process, to really take me out of the film completely.<br/><br/>And the ending is so terrible and completely different to the rest of the film its like a section of a whole other film tacked onto the end.

The ending is a bit bad however not as bad as the devil inside as that is really a bad ending. To improve this film I would stop John Goodman from falling into the acid and keeping the ending from getting bad. The hob (nob monster) did have a good foreshadowing moment as Goodman had a master plan about them as mentioned by female, obviously not the other guy as I believe he was dead.

"The-Sarkologist","10","4","7","25 March 2016"," You're never really sure of the truth
","I have to admit that I was actually thinking of not seeing this movie simply because it didn't sound all that appealing. Okay, the only thing I knew about it was from the title, though the title does give a bit of a hint as to what it is about. Sure, it shares a name with the found footage movie Cloverfield, though I didn't think that there was any real connection between the two. However, after a brief glimpse at the synopsis (and they have done really well to actually keep as much of this film a secret as possible, though you can find the plot on Wikipedia - though if you haven't seen the film I don't recommend that you read it).<br/><br/>Okay, a part of me felt that it was like that Stephen King film (and book) Misery, however 10 Cloverfield Lane is actually so much more. The thing is that there is so much you don't know. While it isn't a found footage film like Cloverfield, the only things that you know are basically what Michelle knows, and since she wakes up in an almost empty room with her leg chained to the wall, it is probably not surprising that she is going to be incredibly suspicious of the person who put her there.<br/><br/>The thing is that you are never actually all that sure as to what is true and what is not true. We are obviously unable to trust a word that comes out of Harold's mouth, but then we sometimes wander about Emmett. In fact we don't know all that much about Emmett himself because he only comes into the picture after Michelle lands up in the bunker – so even though he seems like a nice enough guy the fact that he is with Harold, and the fact that the only way you can measure his authenticity is based upon what Harold says always leaves his identity as a live question.<br/><br/>The other thing is that we cannot see outside, and when we do see outside we only get really small glimpses, so once again we do not know the truth of what Howard is saying about them lying in shelter from a chemical attack. Sure, Howard has a radio which is silent, but then again he does claim to be a technician so it is more than possible to make it appear, based on the radio, that there is nothing outside the bunker. Once again, Michelle's mobile phone has no signal, but they are in a bunker, so that isn't all that surprising.<br/><br/>I have to admit that John Goodman plays his role very, very well. Sure, he may have acted in a couple of comedies in the past (such as playing Rosanne Barr's husband) but he never came across as a comedy actor in the same way that, say, John Candy did. His very hard and serious features make him much more suited to roles such as the one that he plays here, and he certainly does a superb job.<br/><br/>If you like thrillers that will leave you guessing right until the end, and is also full of some completely unexpected twists, then I recommend seeing the film. Okay, there are a couple of clangers, and a couple of areas where you have to really suspend your disbelief, but in the end I'm going to have to say that this is going to be one of the great films of 2016."
"jcbrad-52965","9","4","7","15 March 2016"," Tense and claustrophobic, this will put you on the edge of your seat
","That's what it is, do not go see this movie if you except an action packed flick with extreme fast pace, because it is not. 10 Cloverfield lane is a slow and pretty clever suspense, only let down by the last five minutes at the end.<br/><br/>Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman, is driving away after what seemed to have been an argument with her boyfriend. Distracted by her man calling, she gets hit by a pickup truck and flies off in the field. (Looked like an anti-texting while driving commercial). She then wakes up attached in a bunker. She will meet its builder, Howard (John Goodman), an old conspiracy theorist veteran and Emmet (John Gallagher Jr.), a young man with a broken arm. <br/><br/>One of the many things which are great about this movie is the way it always leaves you guessing. Indeed, early on, Howard explains to us that the world has been subject to an attack and that its surface is irradiated and toxic. It doesn't take long for Emmet and Michelle to make us doubt about it, but an event is going to change our mind and make us believe Howard. But even though you've seen the effect of the ""toxic"" air, you still have doubt on the mental sanity of the old man during the old movie, as the two other protagonists uncovers horrible things about him. <br/><br/>The part which left me in shock the most was when Howard killed Emmet with cold-blood. It's at this moment we realize that this man is not sane and begin to again doubt what we've seen outside. <br/><br/>I also liked the establishment of Michelle's talents in couture, it pays-off really well as she builds the gas mask and suit. <br/><br/>I sadly cannot judge the acting fully, given that I've seen the movie dubbed in French, but besides that, John Goodman gave an amazing performance, he was a very believable ""psycho"". Winstead and Gallagher did a very good job as well. <br/><br/>The cinematography is also great. The camera makes a really good job at make us feel like we are in a tiny bunker by using a lot of close shots and good uncut shots revealing characters or object increasing the tension. <br/><br/>But, onto the disappointing part, the movie could have, and should have stopped as soon as Michelle got out. I felt like the alien attack and the fight scene was too much, the film already had a great tense and suspenseful escape scene, it was not necessary to add this mindless action at the end. <br/><br/>This film lost a point with his ending, but it was no enough to ruin anything, being only 5 to 10 minutes long. Do not go in excepting action or Cloverfield 2, for that matter. I do though totally recommend it if you want a movie with great characters, acting, cinematography, story and suspense."
"jtncsmistad","7","4","7","13 March 2016"," ""10 Cloverfield Lane"": Have we been set up?
","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is Producer J.J. Abrams shrouded in secrecy sequel to the 2008 surprise found footage hit ""Cloverfield"". Sort of.<br/><br/>Without completely surrendering the premise, there are thematic elements from the original which come to prominence in this amply anticipated follow-up widely released this weekend (3/11/16). But certainly not to the overarching degree that these aspects factored intrinsically into it's predecessor.<br/><br/>John Goodman is a particularly peculiar survivalist/conspiracy theorist (like there's any other kind?) who takes Mary Elizabeth Winstead into his farmhouse bunker for ""safekeeping"" in the wake of a violent car crash. John Gallagher Jr. is already a tenant of this cozy cum creepy underground community.<br/><br/>Goodman is, as per usual, his reliable character actor self as Howard, a guy whom you never really know both if you can accept what he's saying as gospel (he claims the world above the trio has succumbed to a catastrophic chemical assault) or what in the living hell he may do next.<br/><br/>Winstead has emerged as a personal favorite of mine. Her role as Michelle is one of a super sci-fi action hero here. It is a distinctly distant departure from previous impressive roles in substantially smaller scale productions including ""Smashed"" and ""Alex of Venice"". Winstead proves in resounding fashion to be more than up to the formidable demands of this heretofore unexplored province of performance. Still, despite a couple of moving moments, it is decidedly disappointing that more of her considerable acting acumen was not on display in this story.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" dutifully delivers it's fair share of twists and turns, scares and surprises and jumps and jolts to be sure. But in the end it couldn't help but feel as one long lead-up to a tacked on departure point for the next installment in the series. And I think that we as faithful fans expected and deserved just a little bit more than that.<br/><br/>Wouldn't you agree, J.J.?"
"nmholland","9","4","7","12 March 2016"," A Near Perfect Thriller, However Not Like It's Predecessor
","10 Cloverfield Lane is directed Dan Trachtenberg, this being his first film, and stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle, a woman who gets into a massive car accident when leaving her fiancé, and wakes up chained to a wall in an underground bomb shelter. Her captor, or possible savior, is a man named Howard, played excellently by John Goodman, who claims there has been an apocalypse, and that the outside air isn't breathable, so she must stay underground. Also in the shelter is a man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who also claims there was an end to the world, however he isn't too sure of what's true. Together, Michelle and Emmett must figure out if there was an Armageddon, and, if not, how to escape the madman that has imprisoned them.<br/><br/>This film is somewhat of a sequel to Cloverfield (2008), however some say it isn't. In a way, it is, and the connection bears the only downside to the film, but I'll get into that later. Right now, I'll discuss the positives. The best thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is the suspense. This movie's is easily one of the most suspenseful thrillers I've ever seen, comparable to some of the greats like Se7en (1995) and Psycho (1960). Much of the suspense is due to the great acting, especially from John Goodman. While Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. did amazing, John Goodman gives one of the best performances of the 2010's. Who knew that Roseanne's husband could play one of the creepiest characters brought to film. I really hope to see him in more roles like this, because he killed it.<br/><br/>Like mentioned earlier, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. also do fantastic, and aren't necessarily washed out by John Goodman's character. Thank you Hollywood, for finally bringing us a strong, independent female character with Michelle. Rather than some stupid person that constantly needs a guy right next to her for protection and attention, Michelle is strong and can stand alone, and face an evil man such as Howard, without a boyfriend holding her hand. John Gallagher Jr. does really well playing a confused man, wondering whether or not the end of the world is real or not, and whether or not he's being lied to. However, his character, Emmett, isn't really fleshed out all that well. This doesn't really take away from the film, since he's not the lead character. Overall, the movie's about Michelle.<br/><br/>The directing is also amazing. 10 Cloverfield Lane is Dan Trachtenberg's first feature film, and he does amazing. I very much look forward to his future films, especially any thrillers he directs, due to just how suspenseful this movie is. All but 10 minutes of the movie takes place in a tiny bomb shelter, and yet the direction seems to open up the bunker, and make it seem bigger than it actually is. This technique is very impressive, and adds a lot to the film, rather than the location get boring after an hour or so. This actually leads me into the next point, which is the run time. This film clocks in at about 2 hours, and it flies by. The run time feels nothing like 2 hours, and a bit more like 45 minutes or so. I honestly felt like I was watching an amazing episode of some horror television show, and it happened to be astounding.<br/><br/>Now, it may sound like I'm just praising this movie, but there was a big negative, involving only the last 10 minutes or so of the run time. Describing this with no spoilers is going to be a bit hard, but I won't ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it. Now, the whole film, the audience, as well as Michelle and Emmett, are wondering whether or not there was an apocalypse or if Howard is just a creepy kidnapper. We find out at the end, and the outcome isn't bad in itself, but it makes another aspect of the film make no sense. Like I said, hard to explain without spoilers, so I'll just leave it at that, and you'll see what I mean when I watch it.<br/><br/>Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very good movie, and a near perfect thriller, with great acting, including John Goodman's Oscar-worthy performance, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's great female lead. I'm going to give 10 Cloverfield Lane an A, or a 9 out of a 10."
"hughboyd88","8","4","7","13 March 2016"," A surprisingly tense and well-written movie, this sequel easily surpasses the original
","I was skeptical about the new Cloverfield going in. The first movie was good, but not great, and it's rare that a sequel is as good as the original. Coming out, however, it was clear that not only is 10 Cloverfield Lane a clear step above the original, but also a great movie in its own right.<br/><br/>While clearly set in the same universe as the original Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very different beast altogether. It uses a completely new cast of characters, is pretty much set in one location, and forgoes the found footage style of the first one for a more traditional direction. While I thought the found footage was fine in the first one, it definitely wouldn't have worked well in this one.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot is about a woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who after being in an accident wakes up trapped in a doomsday prepper's (John Goodman) survival shelter with another man (John Gallagher). There is also a cameo by Bradley Cooper. Goodman's character warns that there has been an attack and that the three of them must remain in the shelter for an indefinite amount of time. As you can guess, the situation in this bunker soon turns south. All three give strong performances. This is clearly the best performance of Winstead's career, and the never disappointing John Goodman also gives one of his better performances. Like his character in Barton Fink, Goodman does an excellent job of playing a character who, while not outwardly evil, clearly has something off about him. With only three characters and one location, the performances alone carry this film a long way.<br/><br/>That being said, the script also doesn't disappoint, which is penned in part by Whiplash director Damien Chazelle. All three characters are well developed, and while some plot points are predictable, the well-written script never lets the audience know exactly where the movie is going.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense and exciting movie definitely worth checking out. It's admirable that in this sequel this get smaller rather than bigger (the actual budget is even less than the first). I think this film could become a sleeper hit, and is a must-see for fans of John Goodman or the original Cloverfield."
"flamingblok11","8","4","7","12 March 2016"," A Drive to ""10 Cloverfield Lane""
","Cloverfield, a film I watched for the first time this week, is terrible. It is a multilayered mess that features obnoxious acting, a story littered with ruinous plot holes, headache inducing cinematography, and all the tension of your great-grandma's wrinkly skin. In short, it's generally unwatchable. 10 Cloverfield Lane is the sequel (or, as J.J. Abrams calls it, ""blood relative"") that no one asked for, constructed in secrecy to generate hype that would never have erupted otherwise. I expected nothing of this movie, but what I got was a pleasant, if not somewhat mixed, surprise.<br/><br/>Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) likes to run away from her problems. After getting into a fight with her boyfriend, she takes a long, country drive that leads to her getting t-boned on a highway in the middle of nowhere, and crashing into unconsciousness. She wakes up in the underground bunker of the enigmatic Howard (John Goodman), who tells her that the world has been decimated by a bio-attack perpetrated by an unknown party. However, things start to grow uneasy as Michelle discovers Howard might not be who he says he is.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is strikingly different from its older brother in that it lacks any real kaiju, and is set up more as a psychological thriller, not a creature feature. Which makes sense, once you discover that the film was conceived by Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken as ""The Cellar,"" an entity totally separate from the Cloverfield universe. It wasn't until J.J. Abrams got a hold of it (and integrated aliens), and Oscar-nominee Damien Chazelle doctored it that it became the film we know today.<br/><br/>I say this because ""The Cellar"" is a really good movie. It's possibly the most gripping suspense tale I've seen since Ex Machina, and it's equally intimate and self-contained. Accompanied by rock solid acting and directing, these elements allow for a laser-focused story that shepherds us through the uncertainty and fear felt by Michelle. I can't remember the last time I genuinely had no clue where a flick was headed, and couldn't tell who was to be believed. It was an unsettling experience that put a big, dumb, anxious smile on my face.<br/><br/>The last twenty minutes, however, were clearly tacked on to earn the Cloverfield connection, and in that regard, the ending earns its name. By that, I mean it sucks. It creates several loose ends that feel upsettingly unsatisfying, and the lazy, hackneyed, unbelievable conclusion betrays everything the film has been working towards. You feel cheated as an audience member, like you wasted the previous hour and a half, and it's unfair to the great movie it's leaching off of.<br/><br/>It's unjust to attack the ending too harshly though, as ""The Cellar"" would, most likely, never have seen the light of day had Mr. Abrams not decided to incorporate it into a pre-established universe. It's just a damn shame to see a great film muddied by modern production and distribution methods. You could certainly do worse at the theatre, but you could also do better. You might as well try to find somewhere that's still showing The Witch, or stream The Exorcist on Netflix if you want your satisfying thriller fix."
"RogerCampbell","10","4","7","12 March 2016"," Great movie that keeps you thinking!
","This was a fantastic movie that keeps you thinking back and forth about a couple of things right to the very end. Is John Goodman's character a good guy or a creep? Was there or wasn't there a chemical, nuclear, or biological attack? Is the other dude that is down there with them on the level or is he in with Goodman's character? I sat there and kept going back and forth, being teased as well as entertained throughout the entire movie. And I felt for Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character the whole time. What is she to believe and what should she do? And then just when you think you've figured it out and you think the movies over...boom! Out of nowhere comes a shocker of a twist that you're not really expecting. This movie is thought provoking, intense at times, and it might even make you jump a couple of times! Great fun and well worth the price of a ticket!"

No, that's never going to work."" <br/><br/>ABRAMS: ""OK, this time I've got The Iron Lady""<br/><br/>BURK: ""I've got 50 Shades of Grey. Hmm tempting, but not really our target audience.

Let's go again""<br/><br/>Abrams pauses and stares at the Cloverfield poster above his desk.<br/><br/>ABRAMS: ""No, wait a minute Bryan.. I have an idea""<br/><br/>Since much of the joy of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is in not knowing where the story will lead, this review will be spoiler free. <br/><br/>The film certainly grabs the attention from the get go, with some of the most dramatic opening titles ever. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (""A Good Day to Die Hard"") plays Rebecca who after a car crash wakes to find herself in a cell room of an underground bunker, accompanied by unstable and unpredictable disaster-nut Howard (John Goodman) and his builder friend Emmett (John Gallagher Jnr). The bunker is stocked with many year's worth of provisions, to outstay the natural disaster that Howard claims is raging above them.<br/><br/>Is there really anything happening? And are Rebecca's fears about Howard's true intentions towards her founded?<br/><br/>I entered this film with high expectations, and for most of the running time I was not disappointed. The early scenes play out like a claustrophobic and tense three-hander stage play: a bit like the Hateful 8, but without as much gratuitous violence. Whilst there are also similarities here to another of Abram's properties – series 2 of ""Lost"" – the set up in Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken's story is both ingenious and innovative. But (as happened in the equally innovative ""Looper"" from 2012) the clever build-up is wasted on a frankly ridiculous and unnecessary ending. There were many better ways that this story could have been wrapped up, but the writers didn't choose any of them.<br/><br/>John Goodman – a highly underrated actor – delivers a chilling performance as the troubled Howard. Mary Elizabeth Winstead received mixed reviews in this household: my wife found her acting overly mannered and distracting, whereas I came away with the opinion that she was quite a find, and this could be a breakout movie for her. Time will tell. For fans of the UK TV's ""Pointless"", the film is also a good 'pointless answer' for a 'Bradley Cooper film': he plays (vocally) Rebecca's estranged husband Ben.<br/><br/>New to me as a film composer is Bear McCreary, who turns in a highly appropriate and tense score to complement the action, spiced up by some much needed and well-chosen jukebox hits.<br/><br/>The first-time director is Dan Trachtenberg, and he nearly has a classic on his hands. What a shame. I was four and a half to five 'Fads' for the first half of the film, but the ending left me annoyed and frustrated at a great opportunity missed.<br/><br/>(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

","I'm only posting this review as a counter to the dozens of glowing critiques in IMDb, and in the hopes of saving at least a soul or two from the unbearable agony of suffering through this waste of time and talent as I did based on the opinions of reviewers who wouldn't know a good movie if it bit them on the behind. If you have any intentions of actually watching this train wreck, I suggest you stop reading this review now: MAJOR SPOILER ALERTS lie ahead. For starters, this has got to be one of the all-time lowest-budget films ever attempted. 95% of the movie is filmed in a bunker with 3 actors. And the big question that keeps viewers watching is: is John Goodman simply a delusional serial killer who kidnaps women and imprisons them in his bunker, or have aliens really attacked our planet? And guess what? It's both! You get two for the price of one! A deranged serial killer movie, and a slimy space alien with tentacles movie! What could be better? Actually, two hours in the dentist's chair would be better. Neither of these plot lines make a grain of sense — especially when the resourceful heroine manages not only to escape John Goodman's clutches, but also to defeat a pack of the local aliens despite their scary flying saucer and green poison gas. To be fair, the space alien portion of the film only lasts about ten minutes, and it is shot in almost total darkness, the better to disguise the fact that the alien is the same rubber octopus that Bela Lugosi wrestled in Bride of the Monster. Don't say you haven't been warned."

It's not hard to realize that there is something more behind all this and we immediately start to suspect that this guy is not what the girl fears. Its very predictable but for now we can let it pass, hoping that the outcome will be surprising and amazing. <br/><br/>Long story short: the outcome is surprising..ly , awfully stupid!

","For the first 90 minutes or so, I was absolutely loving this movie. I went to see it not really knowing what to expect, or even what it was about really, and I was loving it. It had all the right amounts of intensity and scariness, with just enough humor. It was paced well and all the secrets were revealed at appropriate times so that you were never bored, but there were still some moments that weren't as scary. The plot was interesting and intriguing and I was always wanting to find out more. And then came the last 15 minutes. I'm not really sure what happened there. Remember how amazing Lost was until the last season? It was kind of like that. Apparently J.J. Abrams likes to do this to us. It just didn't make sense. I could have easily come up with three or four endings myself that would have fit the movie better and been more entertaining. Still, like Lost, the beginning is just so good that it is easy to overlook the trainwreck that was this movie's ending. All in all, I'd say it was a good movie, even aside from the ending. If it had ended ten minutes earlier, this review would be totally different. So I guess it was pretty good."

","10 Cloverfield Lane is nothing more than another low budget straight to video Dan Trachtenberg release created with the sole purpose to easily generate funds off the back of successful cinematic releases. 10 Cloverfield Lane is arguably Trachtenberg's most notable masterpiece (an innovative (CAPS system) critical and commercial success. It represents a period of his amateur attempts when a perfect storm of talented artists, composers and lyricists came together to create something simply quite wonderful. It is no surprise that sequels / prequels are periodically released not only to 'cash in', but to also maintain public awareness of the original film (again, to keep the money rolling in) It is important to understand that any straight to video garbage is not produced by the same talented people that made Cloverfield so special. The scrips are written very quickly and the vfx is clearly outsourced to Korean animation studios (much like a great deal (if not all) of Disney TV animation (Phineas and Ferb for example)) What is created is a cheaply produced piece of animation, designed to make the maximum financial return possible. It is not made for longevity like the cinematic classics - it is purely a money making exercise.<br/><br/>A lot of us fall for it because we expect the same kind of standard as represented by the original film, but this is never the case unfortunately. The only audience that would possibly enjoy the second rate video releases are the younger viewers as they are more likely to overlook the shortcomings of the projects. This movie is not a ""blood-relative"" sequel to Cloverfield. It definitely shouldn't be marketed as such.<br/><br/>On a more positive note. 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the better examples of these profiteering exercises, as the quality of the effort (although still sub-par) has no certain edge - a greater sophistication perhaps. If the original film left you wanting more, then avoid at all costs. Otherwise, I'd stick to the classics. 10 Cloverfield Lane is strictly a dud."

","2008's Cloverfield was an entertaining movie, but 10 Cloverfield Lane brings entertainment to a whole other level. <br/><br/>Brilliantly written and coaxially directed, you know very early on that it's not going to be a bad film. When the audience has that kind of trust in the filmmakers, it's a very pleasurable experience. Driven by Bear McCreary's very deliberate score, every moment of this film is calculated and poised. <br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Michelle, a young woman running away from something--a relationship, we conclude. Then, not even 5 minutes into the film, something abrupt happens while she's driving. She gets hit by another car, sending her violently spinning off the road.<br/><br/>In the next scene she wakes up to a prison-like room with no windows. She's chained to the wall. In walks a man named Howard, played by John Goodman. Goodman plays this role how you wish he'd play every role. He's mysterious and crazy and infernal. You're never sure if you should trust him or not. Sometimes you feel like he's okay, but other times he does things that make you reconsider. <br/><br/>It turns out they're in a bomb shelter. There is one other person down there with them--a younger guy, about Michelle's age, named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). Howard claims, to Michelle and Emmett's ignorance, that the Earth's air is now chemically contaminated and unbreathable. Michelle and Emmett aren't sure what to believe, but they stick together and have no choice but to trust Howard.<br/><br/>It's like two movies in one. On the first hand, you have a guy who's insane and may be actually kidnapping you, and on the other hand, there could be a possible post-apocalyptic scenario above ground. But it might not matter either way. Just because a crazy guy has a bomb shelter, doesn't mean he's not still a crazy guy.<br/><br/>Director Dan Trachtenberg does a fantastic job in his feature film debut. The movie is almost entirely set in this cramped underground bunker, yet he finds a way to fill all 1 hour and 43 minutes of film without it ever feeling repetitive or boring. We're constantly on the edge of our seats. It's one of the best suspense films in years. Hitchcock would be proud.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 100"
"eabra48463","6","5","11","3 April 2016"," A Good Movie that Takes a Decidedly Wrong Turn
","It's difficult to write a review of ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" because it seems to successfully achieve what it sets out to for the audience, yet it is ultimately very disappointing in the end. It establishes a great premise from the start as, its primary character--Michelle--is involved in a horrific car accident after leaving her boyfriend. She awakens inside the underground bunker of a recluse--John Goodman--who tells her the outside air has been polluted in some sort of attack and that life as they knew it is over. He also informs her that he saved her from certain death by bringing her into his bunker. A neighbor of the Goodman character is also a resident of the bunker and buys into Goodman's story completely. Michelle does not initially believe any of the story and tension is established from the start. Is the recluse crazy or is he absolutely correct? The film then takes the audience on a roller coaster emotional ride through some twists which significantly alter the tone. The claustrophobic circumstances are well-developed in the film and we feel like we're trapped in that bunker with the characters. The acting is also relatively strong and believable. The problem is that the film takes a cliché turn as the writers and director seem to mail it in for the last 15 minutes. As an audience, we tend to remember where films leave us at the end and take that with us for a while. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" takes the audience on a fun ride for most of its run only to leave us at the curb at the very end. It's not a bad film overall, but it could have easily been so much better."

","10 Cloverfield Lane. It begins by dragging the audience into personal issues from the main character and it gets the audience hooked into what its about. Later on the plot continues and the main characters stories get told.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is very drawing and makes you curious about whats to come, Unfortunately the last half was disappointing and very anti-climatic. Going from a zombie apocalyptic world involving safety and survival tactics into an alien invasion with the outcome of one individual being able to take on unknown species on her own and destroying that which would take more than you would think. 10/10 worst movie. Such a waste of money. Don't invest in watching this movie."
"JazukaiX","6","5","11","10 March 2016"," A decent thriller unrelated to Cloverfield
","I was excited to see this movie as I knew nothing about it from the trailers. When the trailer showed the movie revolving around people trapped in a bunker unable to leave, I thought they were misleading us, and the truth about what was outside would be the primary plot and it would somehow relate to the events of Cloverfield. It doesn't, there isn't even a mention of those events. This is not a spoiler, it's a warning, so that you don't watch a film for reasons it doesn't deserve.<br/><br/>It seems the intention of this film was always to be nothing other than a thriller about a woman in captivity, and anything else that may happen was an afterthought, because someone wanted to cash-in on the name recognition Cloverfield would bring.<br/><br/>The acting is great though, the atmosphere is very tense and exchanges between characters are awkward which is hard to pull off with someone as lovable as John Goodman. On the flip side it's plagued by jump-scares which creates a false sense of unease, as I never knew when the next loud noise would strike.<br/><br/>Had the movie just told a story without lying about it's connections to another movie, and not used jump scares, I would respect it as a thriller if that's what the intention was. The ending was not worth waiting through the rest of it to see. As it stands, I don't recommend anyone see it in cinemas, but see it on DVD if you want to."

","The strongest thing that Cloverfield Lane has going for it is that the acting is good and it's probably a touch better than its predecessor. A TOuch! Maybe not too - I may have to watch this again. My initial thoughts on the original Cloverfield was that it was a 6/10, but after reviews, I up'd that to a 7. This may go the other way. It's close - they're actually 2 really different films - making me wonder if/why they didn't connect them in some way.<br/><br/>The film quickly jumps right into the meat of the subject matter, and overall it doesn't feel as slow or as monotonous as other close-quartered devices. <br/><br/>It is about the middle of the film that we get some justification for the situation; squashing some speculation and setting up what really could have been an epic finish.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, low budget films like ""Southbound"", ""Miracle Mile"", or blockbusters like ""12 Monkeys"" handle similar situations with far more effectiveness in(terms of the ending) than does Cloverfield Lane.<br/><br/>There's a few mistakes in the last 10 minutes that were a bit glaring, and the CGI, for a big-budget film like this, was a little below par.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the rest of the film will keep you interested. It's SUPER early, but 10 Cloverfield Lane looks to be one of those that may, or may not stick around for the Top 25 of 2016."

","THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MILD SPOILERS, but honestly nothing more than I'd already gathered from Twitter and talk /reviews on various other forms of social media. Still, you have been warned. Read no further than the following first paragraph if you don't want to risk mild spoilage.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane was surprisingly entertaining. I'm not really a huge fan of movies shot in an enclosed space because, in general, how often does that work out well? (Remember the Ashley Judd movie about bugs? Mmhmm.) However, it worked, and worked well in this. Part of this, no doubt, belongs to the fact that John Goodman put on a freaking amazing performance. That man just OWNED this movie. You knew something wasn't right with him. It was obvious he had some crazy going on. The way he was able to yo-yo between affable and scary, though, was fantastic and kept you guessing as to just how crazy his crazy was. Everything was nailed, from the look in his eyes to the flexing of his hands when he was struggling to keep himself under control. Top- notch!<br/><br/>The other two, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr, also brought good performances to the table and perfectly complimented Goodman's acting. Winstead, who has one of those ""I knowwww you..you'reÂ…you were in something I've seen!"" faces (she's actually got quite the list of acting credits to her name), did a great job as a solid female lead. She sold her confusion, wariness, intelligence and strength to you with considerable skill. Great job by Winstead. She didn't shine like Goodman did, but she never faltered either.<br/><br/>This movie quite literally had me on the edge of my seat leaning forward, tips of my fingers near my ears at one point because I was expecting bad loudness. Trachtenburg delivered. From the absurd to the affable family moments, and from the crazy-scary to the Cloverfield freakouts, the only weak part of the film really seemed to be the fact that the ending they gave it wasn't really necessary. It would have been just as strong if they'd ended it before it went full Cloverfield. It might have even been stronger. It felt like Trachtenburg gave in to ever-present ""Action! ACTION! WE NEED ACTION!"" push that seems to present in Hollywood now, even if its unnecessary, and then wanted to put everything in a basket with a pretty bow. But ending it right before it went BOO! would have left people walking from the theaters, feeling vaguely disturbed, and talking only about the fantastic performances by the three actors.<br/><br/>Overall, great job by all involved and it was definitely worth the price of the tickets, beer, popcorn, and mnms!"

But it keeps you guessing about just what is going on.<br/><br/>John Goodman puts on one of the most impressive performances of his career, with fine support from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. As to the question of how much the movie relates to the 2008 movie, I'm eager to see where it goes from here, if in fact they make a third movie.<br/><br/>Good one."
"arungeorge13","7","1","1","6 June 2017"," Review - 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)
","For much of the film, the title hardly comes off as significant. The perceiver in you has a lot of questions with regard to why a psychological thriller with claustrophobic traits has been named 10 Cloverfield Lane. What is the relevance? Well, the final act provides all the answers that the viewer (who was expecting a full- blown Cloverfield sequel) has been seeking.<br/><br/>The movie starts on a rather tame note. We take on the perspective of Michelle (although not by way of POV like in Cloverfield) who is still undergoing post break-up trauma. Michelle is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead whose versatility has been proved with the passage of time. Her Ellen Ripley-esque role in The Thing (2011) was nothing short of tremendous. She is a perfectly bankable actor for scenes that involve high levels of tension and unpredictability. This fact is reinstated firmly by her performance in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Winstead is literally pitch-perfect, but we also have John Goodman (Flintstones, Argo, Flight, Hangover 3, The Artist) and John Gallagher Jr. sharing screen-space with her.<br/><br/>To describe the plot in a single line would sound something like this: After getting involved in a car accident, Michelle wakes up in a bunker inhabited by Howard (Goodman), who is also its creator, and Emmett (Gallagher Jr.) who pass the news to her that the outside world is unfit for living as the air is contaminated due to an attack by some unknown entity. The viewer, like Michelle, doesn't want to buy this story and we get behind Michelle when she makes frantic attempts to escape the bunker.<br/><br/>Twists are carefully revealed one after another and soon we realize that things are not what they seem. Howard becomes increasingly dominant and peevish towards his bunker-mates and once certain facts are concluded, Michelle and Emmett hatch a plan to escape the bunker for good. The outcome is unexpected and thrilling. John Goodman steals the show with his enthralling performance that is almost perfectly in sync with Winstead's. Gallagher Jr. provides the much- needed comic relief during the tensive build-up.<br/><br/>One question still remains. How does all this fit into a 'Cloverfield' movie? Answers await in the final act. After a brief scene involving a brilliantly choreographed tussle, the viewer does heave a sigh of relief, only to realize that there are bigger dangers lurking on stand-by. The last quarter hour sure has ample edge-of-the seat moments (although involving extensive use of CG) and leads to a nail-biter of a finale, somewhat reminiscent of the climax sequence in The Thing (2011); only better this time around, thanks to some diligent writing by Josh Campbell, Mathew Stuecken and more significantly Damien Chazelle (of Whiplash fame).<br/><br/>Fans of the original Cloverfield have reasons aplenty to be both happy and sad about 10 Cloverfield Lane. This one is not POV, the storyline deals with claustrophobic elements and isolation for most part and it is not directly connected to Drew Goddard/Matt Reeves' Cloverfield. But where it succeeds is in creating implied tension with respect to fear of the unknown. Is the air out there really contaminated? Who was responsible for the attack? What really led them to take refuge in a bunker? Winstead and Goodman prove to be near-perfect casting choices for a film that is brilliantly written by the trio of Campbell, Stuecken and Chazelle, and masterfully directed by Dan Trachtenberg. Music by Bear McCreary, cinematography by Jeff Cutter and editing by Stefan Grube are worthy of mention. The music builds apprehension, camera-work is brisk (but not headache-inducing) especially towards the climax and the edits make sure the run-time does not exceed a decent 1 hour 40 minutes."

","In short I'd say I don't think this movie needed the addition of sci-fi to make it great. 95% of the movie works as a very good thriller, and for that alone I'd rate this movie quite high. The last 5% of the movie although very entertaining just doesn't feel necessary. I'll give it this though, I totally didn't see it coming and was left feeling quite lost for words but in a good way. But still, with some good writing, I think the end of the movie could have had a better twist, or a somewhat more sophisticated conclusion considering the quality of the thriller that precedes it. Unfortunately what this does is ruin what could have been an instant thriller classic into a somewhat confused sci-fi experience. The end of this movie is just downright bizarre and doesn't feel like it fits in with the rest of the movie, but saying that, I gotta say I still thoroughly enjoyed the ride."

For a significant number of people, CLOVERFIELD is considered the pinnacle of ""FOUND FOOTAGE"" movies. However, throw in some sci-fi and you have CLOVERFIELD. This is for a different review.<br/><br/>After watching the original CLOVERFIELD and being thoroughly disappointed, I had very much similar expectations for the second movie in the franchise. I can tell you with certainty if this movie did not have the words CLOVERFIELD in the title, you would not believe that it is part of the same franchise. 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE takes a more default approach of movie making as opposed to the FOUND FOOTAGE cluster that the first movie happened to be. <br/><br/>To sum it up into one paragraph, 10 CLOVERFIELD LAND was actually a surprisingly suspenseful enjoyable adventure. The cinematography was on point and really contributed to the overall feeling of suspense throughout the whole film. The acting was not overdone and felt necessarily realistic. The characters are somewhat interesting, especially the ""antagonist"". However, there are faults involved.<br/><br/>((POSSIBLE (somewhat nonexistent) SPOILERS)) A major con is the ENDING. Without spoiling much, an element of the movie was abruptly introduced within the last 15 minutes of the movie. Essentially, you have a suspense-thriller movie that was actually executed decently until the last 15 minutes. Seriously, what were they thinking? The ending was so far-fetched and annoyingly rushed. I'm okay with the extraterrestrial plot point. However, if it is thrown in for the heck of making it an alien movie, then I'm sorry bud. It didn't work. It was a failed ending.<br/><br/>Another (small) gripe I had with this movie was negligible pacing issues. Some scenes were drawn out or plainly necessary. Others were in fact boring. To add, some of the ""creative ideas"" of problem solving were a tad bit far fetched, but I dismiss all disbelief for the sake of enjoyment.<br/><br/>I wouldn't really call this an IMPROVEMENT over the first movie considering they were executed much differently from each other.

","10 Cloverfield Lane is beautifully directed by Matt Reeves, and its cinematography is excellent. The close shots in the beginning and throughout the film lend to it's drama and suspense. The story contains irony that keeps the ending in your head well after the credits. Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character Michelle is a broken bundle of emotions and Winstead harnesses her fragile nature flawlessly, while seamlessly showing her incredible emotional range, sometimes mid- scene. Throughout the movie Michelle seems to heal somewhat, and then becomes broken again when she learns the broader context of her situation.<br/><br/>John Gallagher Jr.'s character Emmet is a needed snap on character who makes the story more robust, and his presence gives the needed shock and awe in the later scenes. John Goodman's character Howard is hard to read in the early part of the film. Goodman builds the suspense artfully in his performance, allowing us not to see what lies under his veil until he is ready.<br/><br/>This act for certain is one that will not leave you disappointed."

","Knocked unconscious in an automobile accident, a young woman wakes up in an underground bunker and has to determine whether or not her male companions are telling the truth about a nuclear apocalypse above ground in this unsettling thriller starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Tension hangs well in the air throughout with John Goodman turning in a fine, deliberately ambiguous performances as the chief captor/rescuer who may or may not have lured another young woman down to the bunker before. The bunker itself is also a magnificent feat of art direction as it often looks more like a comfortable den than a traditional fallout shelter (there is a worthwhile brief documentary on the DVD about the bunker's meticulous construction). While the first hour and a quarter of the film is captivating stuff with eerie sound effects and sporadic power failures, the film runs at least twenty minutes too long with all ambiguity erased near the end. Well filmed as the final few scenes may well be, they lack the energy that the film manages to otherwise drum up from making us question what is really afoot. The concluding scene admittedly has quite a bit to say about the choices we make under stress, but the denouement here is nevertheless underwhelming for a film that, for the most part, preys upon insecurities among strangers and the difficulty of developing trust. Winstead is very good though, and with films like this and 'Faults', she is proving herself to be quite an actress. The majority of the movie also moves very well for a director making his big screen debut."
"mmlund2","1","6","15","25 March 2016"," Conned into watching a horror movie with an extreme feminist bent vs sci-fi thriller
","Was it suspenseful? Yes. Was John Goodman's performance convincing? Absolutely. Was it the alien/monster thriller I was expecting? No. I should have known better from a movie produced by JJ Abrams, but I went and saw the movie anyway, hoping for an entertaining post apocalyptic thriller. Instead I got bamboozled into watching an extremely feminist movie portraying all males as abusers of women, with one exception, Emmet, who was a milk toast man-child. <br/><br/>The female protagonist had an abusive boyfriend she flees from, a history with an abusive father, and in the course of the movie, relates a story about an abusive father that roughly treats and hits his little daughter in Home Depot. Her captor, male of course, is a homicidal maniac. Even Santa Claus, when they are playing a board game, is portrayed as a scary male figurehead 'always watching' and 'knows what you are up to.' Why do movies like these with a strong female lead have to show men in such an unflattering light and disenfranchise half their audience? Her co-captor Emmett can't stand up to Howard, played by John Goodman, even though he is a fat old man. The female protagonist on the other hand is portrayed as a superhero, with an throwing arm so accurate and powerful it belongs in the major leagues. <br/><br/>95% of the movie takes place in the basement, with much more of a horror film feel than a sci-fi thriller. Unlike other critics, I thoroughly enjoyed the last few minutes of the film where the protagonist finally escapes the bunker and her tormentor, only to do battle with alien forces. The sci-fi finally kicks in, I just wish most of the movie was dealing with that antagonist vs John Goodman's character."

I have never written a review before but feel like I have lost 2 hours that I can't get back and need to warn others!<br/><br/>I quickly skimmed this site before watching and saw that as Bradley Cooper was in it it may be OK at least and as it didn't mention anything about being related to the alien Cloverfield which I would never choose to watch anyway.<br/><br/>The film wasn't that bad at first..There was some sort of murder/ missing girl plot which soon fizzled out, I like thrillers so could cope with the slow pace. Once she got out the bunker I realised I had made the mistake and watched a sci fi film instead of a thriller/ mystery. <br/><br/>If you don't feel like wasting 2 hours of your life and watching an alien film..

"DoctorHver","4","5","12","13 April 2016"," Fred Flinstone cannot save this other wise bad movie.
","This film left me with an unsatisfactory viewing. Not because of Fred Flinstone aka John Goodman's performance as Howard which I think is brilliant. Rather an cop-out story telling, major plot problems.<br/><br/>First for me Michelle's character does seems to be a marry Sue type of character all to perfect for her own good soon as she starts to take notice of her environment, Marry Sue type of characters are awfully boring watch, unless its filled with romance and/or soft-core. But there is no romance in this film so Mary Sue type of character which Michelle is is not need at all. Second The other guy in the bunker seems to be proper white trash and fool and is unable to make his own judgement, so you will have to wonder who's more foolish Howard or Emmmett who follows him as you watch and he is all so manipulated by Michelle to believe her instead of Howard although there seems to be no evidence why he should switch sides. So you you don't seed any remorse or tears when Howard shoots him and kills him. Third it it seems to be out of the blue as John Goodman's performance gives me similar vibes as he did when he was cast as Fred in that live-action Flinstone movie back in 1994, i.e well meaning but misunderstood character. As its never made clear what actually happened to his daughter or that supposed other girl given the different photos Emmett and Michelle find in one of Howards book.<br/><br/>Film is biggest problem was filmed is the ending, because it feels suddenly like you are watching a completely different movie. There is no hint at Aliens through out the film and then out of the blue Aliens appear when she finally escape the bunker, thus the ending is cop out and leaves the viewer with unsatisfactory feeling. <br/><br/>This movie is nothing but another bad effort from director J.J. Abrahams whom seems to be master of marry sue characters, films full of plot holes and cop out story telling. As I said in the beginning I think John Goodman brilliant and the only thing worth watching in this other wise bad movie, thus if not for Goodman I pretty sure I would have given this film maybe 2-3 stars of 10 or and 1/2 of 5 stars."

","Viewers looking for the type of stellar performance we're used to from John Goodman will be sorely disappointed by this complete hack of a film.<br/><br/>The writers couldn't decide whether they wanted the film to be a sci-fi, drama, or psychological thriller film. Our ""heroine"" starts with relationship drama, moves into an apparent (long and boring) abduction by a psychotic conspiracy theorist (played by Goodman), and ends with the worst alien encounter since ""It Came From Outer Space"".<br/><br/>I can't decide whether it was the lack of a solid plot, the completely predictable (and horribly botched) ""plot twist"", or the horrendous acting that made this film so terrible; all I know is that by the time it was over, all I wanted was my 97 minutes back."
"gortx","Null","4","9","18 March 2016"," So-So even without the questionable ending
","To discuss 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE without referencing the ending is high near impossible. Suffice it to say for now that the title is a giveaway, and that the finished movie is the result of an original screenplay that has been re-engineered to shoe-horn into an existing franchise. How one feels about that seems to be topic A when discussing it.<br/><br/>But, CLOVERFIELD has a number of other issues apart from it's fractured narrative. The whole set-up itself simply comes off as an extended episode of The Twilight Zone - and, a not especially exceptional or original one at that. It's essentially yet another take on a Bomb Shelter/Last Persons On Earth yarn. Further, it echoes the Tim Robbins sequence in Spielberg's WAR OF THE WORLDS. The acting is good, particularly by John Goodman, there are some nice details and a decent enough twist (not the ending, but within the shelter storyline), but they simply aren't enough to sustain interest for a full length feature. By the time we get to the questionable questionable one can't help but look back and ask what was the point of the whole enterprise? The main body of the movie bears precious little impact on what comes next, and that ""twist"" comes off as a red herring signifying little beyond a feeling of distaste. <br/><br/>Forging ahead carefully about the ending. If the online stories are true about the original ending, I would say that it was better - but, not enough to make the movie actually that much more so. At least it retains the mystery of what happened and plays into the fatalistic tone of the earlier section. The released version certainly is more action-packed, and, yes, does tie-in to it's predecessor - but, makes the main body of the picture even less connected to the overall scheme of things. 90% of the movie seems like a prelude to get to the real tale. A Twilight Zone-like twist without the skill of execution of the best of that TV series.<br/><br/>P.S. Why is it that these end of the world 3-ways always seem to be two guys a girl? Kinky writers?"

","As in many movies of the genre it is the sound effects that create the suspense. The plot raises more questions than it answers: why was Michelle restrained by the leg behind a heavily locked door? How come her leg healed so quickly? Why did her mobile phone work at all if everything out there was destroyed? Why was the bunker lit by so many power consuming lamps? The movie did not convey a sense of time, how long after the disaster was it before that woman banged on the outside door? The sutured cut on the forehead healed nicely, how long does that take?

","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I couldn't. At the risk of sounding jaded ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" bored me. I didn't get a sense of tension and foreboding from this movie like I did with ""Bone Tomahawk."" I enjoyed that one. It was interesting seeing how the sheriff and his posse faced what was going on around them. Plenty of character development there. <br/><br/>Instead I had the feeling that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was really a direct-to-video feature that somehow escaped to the big screen. <br/><br/>First off, I was not impressed with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). I thought she was whiny, rather shallow and not as cunning as she thought she was. I had the feeling that Howard (John Goodman) saw through her act and never really trusted her. He probably figured he could wear her down with time. Goodman was menacing as always. I had no problem with him. <br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>There was no dramatic tension here. I knew it was only a matter of time before Michelle escaped. <br/><br/>I knew the giant monster from the first flick was not going to be in this movie. Too bad. Would have made more sense if Michelle had encountered him after she fled the bunker.<br/><br/>Poor Emmett was cannon fodder to me. I knew he was doomed the moment I laid eyes on him. <br/><br/>Howard was supposedly a genius in building his bunker. Then why would he construct air ducts that were so small only a slim young woman could crawl through them? Even if his plan always was to kidnap a young woman and bend her to his will, why would he trust her with such an important task? <br/><br/>Why didn't the acid do more damage to Howard? <br/><br/>Michelle goes from a young woman who doubts herself to Ellen Ripley roasting giant alien ships with a single Molotov cocktail. <br/><br/>And the biggest plot hole of all? Throughout the movie Michelle repeatedly states that she wants to find out what happened to her boyfriend and her family. She says this over and over again. It's her reason for wanting to escape in the first place. Yet at the end, instead of going to look for her family she decides to head for Houston because that city is on the air pleading for people with medical or combat experience. <br/><br/>Michelle has neither. Unless she thinks that sewing up Howard's small gash that one time qualifies as valuable medical experience. And her transition to Rambo just wasn't believable. She heads for Houston even though she knows none of her loved ones live in Houston. <br/><br/>I just couldn't suspend disbelief for this movie. I've read better fan fiction."

I would have had a much better radio comms set up. And .... P-L-E-A-S-E!!! the air ventilation system? There is no way to access the breakers (I didn't see any filtration), once you're secured in the bunker?!?! Who designs an air filtration system that only some scrawny girl can access by crawling through the ducting?!?!? And the intake is where? I'll stop there ... there is a lot more that don't work ... but realism is clearly not the objective of this movie.<br/><br/>Not much in the way of a story line here either. Goodman could have smoked a few J's before each scene and it would not have been noticeable. Who wrote this ... a grade school English class?<br/><br/>What was the purpose of John Gallagher Jr's character? Give Goodman somebody to shoot?<br/><br/>Opening a 40 gallon drum of acid (really?) in a bunker like that would have killed them all rapidly ... never mind standing over it breathing the fumes!<br/><br/>Since 'Mr. Prepared' had no NBC suits, of any kind, Susie Cream-cheese (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)has to make one (Ala MacGyver)out of a plastic soda bottle, shower curtain and ... the handy mans best friend ...

They should change their names and take measures to disguise themselves ... hopefully this won't stain their careers to much. But ... taking into account the lousy movies Hollyweed has been putting out? Maybe not.<br/><br/>Expecting Actors and Actresses to compensate for talent-less movie makers, although the current trend, just don't get it done. Even though this only cost us $6 to watch ... it was a wasted $6 ... not to mention our time."
"Monoxstride","5","4","10","3 April 2016"," One of the worst endings I've ever seen
","This was a movie that I really enjoyed watching. It has an intriguing plot, good characters, good character development, good pacing, a bit of well-placed and subtle humor, appropriate amounts of action, but best of all, it keeps you guessing. I was never bored for a second watching this. It's a great example of a psychological thriller that holds onto your attention by interest in the story alone. It was great.<br/><br/>So if I have all these good things to say about it, why the mediocre rating? The answer is the ending. I won't spoil it at all, I'll just give my opinion on it. I don't think I've ever seen a conclusion to a movie that was more disconnected from its earlier parts. It had virtually no relationship to the plot and abandoned every good aspect of the rest of the movie. It was as if the movie went insane. What happened here? Did they bring in a completely different writer for the last part? Did the studio suddenly call the writer up one day and inform him that he had exactly 5 minutes to finish the script? It's really something that you have to see for yourself to appreciate. I don't think I've ever seen anything like it.<br/><br/>I would have given this movie an 8 probably, had it not been for the ending. That's how atrocious it was. Is that unfair? Well, the ending is a very important part of a movie. In fact I might say it's the most important part, depending on the case. You can't create a great movie and then destroy it with the last few minutes, and expect it to still be considered good.<br/><br/>I only realized after looking at this page that this movie is partially a sequel to Cloverfield. I've never seen the first one. Perhaps if I had, this atrocity would make more sense, I don't know. All I know is that taking this movie on its own, as it was marketed, it's probably the biggest waste of a potentially great movie that I've ever seen. Such a shame."
"theworldismine0","2","4","10","20 March 2016"," I love you, John Goodman
","As I walked into the theatre with my friends to see this movie, I was anxiously awaiting what I thought would be a most strange & wonderful work of art. With the first Cloverfield fresh in my memory, I hoped for action, suspense, and above all, sci-fi horror. This movie provided none of these things and instead left me dumbfounded & frantic wondering how it had received such great reviews, not only by fellow users on here, but also professionals. It lacked all three, pathos, ethos & logos. As for emotional connections to any of the characters, there were too great of gaps that made it impossible to feel for them. Goodman's performance was the best part of this movie and one could argue that his complexities towards the women in his life were enough to cover the pathos throughout. Credibility. Logic. Prior to this sentence are two words that never came to mind during my viewing of 10 Cloverfield Lane. I was pushed so far in the opposite direction that I would be willing to bet that these words may not even be in the vocabulary of (at least) some of the people who made this film. <br/><br/>The main character was like a house after hosting a party of 1,000 people, and then left in its destruction to rot. She was rotting... And trust me, it was not pleasant. This character's lack of credibility was probably the biggest issue, because she is unappealing, verging on appalling the second she is introduced. I found it physically and emotionally impossible to relate to her or feel anything for her. As the movie went on and we learned bits & pieces of her personality, I deeply hoped to be inspired. At one point I thought, who cares if I can relate or not, maybe she will be inspiring and that will be enough. I thought wrong, She was everything but. I was heavily rooting against her through the whole movie and even still. <br/><br/>So, seeing as how I wished for the main character to brutally die at the hands of surprisingly cool-looking martians, I give 10 Cloverfield Lane a big thumbs down.<br/><br/>P.s.- Are we really still dressing females in WHITE TANK TOPS every single time action or horror is involved? Come up with something new people, there are thousands of other colors & clothing available that is still ""sexy"", that can be torn and ruffed up easily, and that will reveal breasts and nipples when the clothing gets wet. Thus, white tank tops are no longer needed and have been overstaying their welcome for about thirty years now. Thanks."

","I made an IMDb account just to rate this movie.<br/><br/>Let me start off with this-- the reason why this movie even deserves a 4 out of 10 is because it had a good start. It was intriguing--- the woman trapped in the shelter with a man and the psycho. I have to say, my heart did race at some points; it was good at being a thriller.<br/><br/>Now, time for the reason why this rating is so low: the ending. If you plan to watch this movie, please walk out of the theater at the last ten minutes. This ending was the most obscene and hilarious disappointment I've seen in a while, I actually laughed in theaters. It was almost like the directors had no idea what to come up with on what happened outside, so why not just aliens? It would have been five times better if the guy was just a psycho, the dying girl outside was a set-up by him, and everyone was actually fine outside. I've never even remotely seen something so horrible that killed a pretty decent thriller movie. I'm curious on why people rate this so high.<br/><br/>Also, the ending was way too abrupt. You can tell by this that there will most likely be a second movie, if they even make enough money for one. I know that I won't be seeing it, since I know it's probably going to be filled with a bunch of lame alien warfare. <br/><br/>I was expecting this to be better--from the reviews."

","You know that uneasy feeling you get when driving alone at night? Particularly down a street you're not familiar with or through a neighborhood that is foreign to you? Something just feels off. Usually it's all in your head. You're just getting a bit paranoid for no reason. Have you ever felt like someone was watching you? The hair on your arms stands up, the slow churning queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach suddenly becomes apparent, you have to keep looking behind you even though there is never anything there you just have to because what if? Those feelings are 10 Cloverfield Lane.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is about the end of the world, or so that is the perception John Goodman's Howard gives us. He has built a doomsday bunker stockpiled with enough supplies to last for years. After Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Michelle is involved in an automobile accident he brings her to his bunker. This is all you need to know plot wise. Do yourself a favor and see this with knowing as little as possible about it.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane takes it's viewers on an uneasy and wholly uncomfortable journey. It slithers along at a rather brisk pace while getting darker, grimmer, and more unnerving with each passing moment. Every time you think you have it figured out it throws a new seedy wrench into your theory. John Goodman's Howard conspiracy theorist who doesn't seem right in the head. You know the term a few screws loose? This guy never had those screws to begin with. Goodman's remarkable turn as Howard is another excellent proof of his immense talent. He's paranoid, terrifying, likable, and completely unsettling. This is not a man you would ever want to meet.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead follows up her unbelievable all-time level performance in Faults with yet another simply brilliant performance here. With those two along with Smashed and Alex Of Venice she is quickly becoming one of the most versatile young actresses around. She plays Michelle with a fierce tenderness. Two descriptions that should not go hand in hand, but she accomplishes this feat in outstanding fashion. She creates a fully realized person here. At times it is easy to forget she is even playing a character. Her pain, sorrow, fear, conviction are all expressed amazingly and easily believed. She lives in this film and this film breathes life because of her.<br/><br/>John Gallagher Jr. delivers quite the beauty of a performance himself, however I'm not going to speak much on his character. I feel it's better that way.<br/><br/>Dan Trachtenberg has already shown is technical prowess with his Portal short. Here he expands himself to glorious results. There is no doubt he was the right man for this job. He lets his actors grow, and he aptly builds a very intense and very horrifying world around them. He keeps the pace smooth while keeping a frantic feel to it all. The mood he constructs here is an edge of your seat, close your eyes, and don't look down thrill. I am already eagerly anticipating his next work.<br/><br/>2016 has it's first must see of the year. This taut and mysterious thriller manages to keep the tension at an all time high and it's viewers guessing for it's duration. Even despite the obvious alluding it's title lends this film will keep your mind turning. The final 15 minutes are guaranteed to lead to very different feelings, but for me they couldn't have been done better. It is those last moments that truly solidified this as an absolute masterwork. Do not miss this one.<br/><br/>10/10"
"robnunya","4","5","15","5 May 2016"," Good, but one thing rubbed me wrong - one BIG thing
","As far as movies go, whatever. Watchable. But I cannot stand this of-late propaganda that Russia is the bad guy. No, the movie does not wholly revolve around this, but Hollywood, under the current line of D.C. and media lies and propaganda simply tows the line of hatred and racism against any people it deems unfit. Russia is not a threat to anyone. NATO and 'murica are! If anything, it is Russians that need to worry about the current US administration's outright, blatant, disgusting lies and twisted, psychotic, extremist and determined nonsense and absurdity to turn the people of the US against any country insisting to retain its sovereignty and not be told what to do and how to live.<br/><br/>I went into this review saying to myself ""Don't make it political, don't make it political,"" but when I see Hollywood churning out parallel lies to those of the media and those of the current Washington and banking scumbags, it becomes a matter of simple right and wrong and I cannot help myself. <br/><br/>People, STOP. Read, research, read some more (preferably history printed and published many years ago), and just plain use your common sense. Movies like this, along with all of the other nonsensical and conjured propaganda out there, just as with Germans in the 1930s, turn normal people into brainless cattle. The references to Russia in this movie as being a ""threat"" are not only unfounded and unjustified, but are obnoxious and relentlessly sinister.<br/><br/>To compare Russia as a threat to the US is to compare a person trapped inside their own house while surrounded by armed robbers outside of it, calling the trapped person a ""threat"" because they went to the den and got their rifle out... and started cleaning and dusting it off just in case.<br/><br/>My review of this movie, while admittedly only touching on one particular point in it, nevertheless is a valid one for those who watch things on television and in the cinema and know nothing of the underlying intent/s within them. The Overton Window is in 5th gear with the pedal to the floor in this film. Just be advised to spot the loony, political BS in it. If Hollywood insists on making every last possible thing on the screen involve wretched, intellectually condescending, and factually skewed politics in them, then it should also not be so terrible to note those things and review these films with the same political intervention they so desperately deserve. <br/><br/>I get disgusted whenever the ""Russian aggression"" brainwashing train comes thundering in at 100 MPH with no brakes and a blaring horn. If you believe a word of it, including all the lies about Ukraine, Crimea, etc., then forgive me for saying so, but you are a fool. Don't be a fool. Educate yourself beyond what the MSM and Hollywood sell to you. With each little drop of carefully worded lies such as the ones offered in this film, if even one out of ten people buy it, that is enough to make a world of difference -- a difference in the wrong and completely incorrect direction of truth and facts that will shape the minds of easily impressionable people, who in turn will then unconsciously end up repeating the same nonsense thereafter as if they know something. <br/><br/>Sorry, but that makes me feel ill. Otherwise, the movie was so-so. I could have given this a 1* rating, but I decided not to let the politics get in the way of the actual story except for this much needed review and point within its context - a putrid, lying, irrational subtext. The writers, producers and director should be ashamed of themselves for that specific reason."

After watching this movie it is clear that the producers were banking on the Cloverfield name to get some greenbacks and it worked ($40 mil gross with a $15 mil budget). The end leaves no mystery. Also, did anyone else notice all of the rip-offs from War of the Worlds and Men in Black? The farmhouse. The alien ship arm that grabs things up to the ship. The overused throw-the-device-into-the-alien-mouth-and-watch-it- blow-up trick. John Goodman is Tim Robbins in War of the Worlds. The whole film is just too cheesy and unoriginal. It did have a few moments of good direction, but not enough to save it for the ""good film"" category. If it had been titled ""War of the Cloverfield Lane in Black"" like it should have been, it would have been a bust on its own. Go see Cloverfield the original again for a really, really good film.

"emhall-54162","2","4","11","14 March 2016"," 10 Plot Hole Lane
","I went into this a somewhat fan of Cloverfield. The first one wasn't by any means genius, but it was enjoyable for a monster flick. When I saw they made a sequel with John Goodman, I was pretty excited. And the first act of the movie was decent. But the movie quickly backslides as it pushes into the second and third act.<br/><br/>**Spoilers**<br/><br/>The movie would like you to believe that it charts a weak woman's rise from being paralyzed from fear to defeating a fearsome alien. But the movie unfortunately forgets that Michelle is strong from the beginning. After being captured by Goodman's character (Howard), she whittles a crutch into a sphere IN MERE MINUTES, lights a fire in the air vent, and attacks him. Curiously, the movie back tracks and she says she's weak, the product of child abuse (which, by the way, is a pointless and pathetic attempt to explain her supposed cowardly behavior). But throughout the movie, she continually tries to attack Howard and escape. Howard claims that they cannot go outside because aliens or military men have infected the air with toxins, and she initially trusts him, but then realizes he was keeping girls in the bunker, so she decides to escape and find help. At the climax of the movie, Howard kills Emmett (who is also in the bunker) and then chases her, B- movie style around the bunker. She topples acid on him (yes, there's a barrel of acid in there because...well, the plot demanded it), and he survives, just in time to try to stab at her while she escapes via air ducts....<br/><br/>....then she realizes that oops, Howard was right! There are aliens. After running around, she jumps in her car, is picked up by the alien, and she crafts (Lara Croft, Tomb-Raider style) a Molotov cocktail. She easily heaves it into its mouth, and it explodes. She falls to the ground, gets back into the car, hears a call on the radio for people to help defeat aliens and she drives off into the sunset. Or rather, the alien filled sunset. <br/><br/>Plot Hole Notables: 1) Howard is maybe a pedophile. We never know. That fact is just there is make him seem scarier. 2) Even though they need the air ducts to survive, Howard specifically made them in such a way that a small woman would be able to climb through them, rather than himself, which means if he hadn't kidnapped her he would have never been able to get through the busted ducts 3) Howard survives his body being dumped in acid that works so fast it had practically dissolved Emmett's body in minutes. 4) Michelle magically heaves said cocktail on the first try, easily defeating something a whole army couldn't withstand. 5) She complains she is cowardly yet shows no sign of it throughout the movie, other than a backstory.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a movie that was 80% about a bunker and another inexplicable 20% franchise tie-in. The movie says nothing, is vague, and screws with audiences just cuz. Acting's not bad, though, which earned it that extra star."

John Goodman played a terrible role with no depth, gave an empty performance... I was expecting so much more from him. This script gave no one anything to work with."

","I wish I could rate the first hour of this movie separate from the last 20 minutes. I was really into this movie wondering if outside really was dangerous, if the other guy was in on it, and many more questions. <br/><br/>Great acting and lots of uncertainty and mystery. <br/><br/>---------<br/><br/>**spoilers**<br/><br/>When she got out of the bunker and the aliens attacked. Really? The entire movie was NOT about aliens - then you had to go and make it bat poop crazy. I like a drama that REALLY COULD HAPPEN. And up until that point all of it could have happened. <br/><br/>Here is the alternate ending I wish I could have had: She got out of the bunker, realized there was no danger in the air, ran to the road and got to a police station. They figure out the reality of how crazy this man is and even come up with a few more missing people (maybe even his ex- wife). Then they go to arrest him and he is not there. Enter part 2 or end the movie with him in a new town talking to a young woman or looking to hire someone to help him build a new bunker (with a war story about the new scars on his face from the acid)."

","I will not spoil the ending of this movie in this review. I will, however, tell you that the ending will leave you extremely disappointed. <br/><br/>85% of this movie is absolutely brilliant. Its pleasantly unpredictable and if you enjoy psychological suspense, you will enjoy this much of the movie. It was on the road to receive 10 out of 10 stars. The writing and acting were both brilliant on every level. <br/><br/>Then... out of nowhere ... and I mean literally out of nowhere, the movie goes to crap. You will know it as soon as you see it as though its a sign from the heavens. The writers decided to not only change the direction of the movie, but the genre of the movie. <br/><br/>While some would call this brilliant, most would argue that those people are smoking something and ruined their movie. I spent hours pondering what could have possessed these people to end this movie the way in which they did and the answer has not reached me. <br/><br/>All that I can do is write this movie review in hopes that I save people like me in search of good writing in movies in a time period in which its hard to come by. I have also taken the liberty of writing my own ending to appease myself and my significant other in a sort of fan fiction type of way.<br/><br/>In conclusion, rating this movie was so difficult because I felt like I was rating two different movies. The majority of the movie gets a solid 10 stars. The ending gets a very flawed 2 stars. As I said, not only was the ending terrible but it was cheesy as well. When I weighed the ratings together, I originally gave this movie a 6 out 10 stars but that's just too high for a movie that ends this poorly."
"nitinkatipn","5","2","4","10 February 2017"," Boring and Cliché
","Movie Rating like this on IMDb makes it really difficult to trust which is a good movie and which is not. Seriously 7.1 rating for such a mediocre silly movie. <br/><br/>There is really nothing interesting going on in this movie, 100 other such movie have been created and flopped over the year. A old man, kidnapping a young girl and acting all weird and crazy scary is so cliché. There is no suspense in the movie and its so predictable than one can predict the end after 10 minutes into the movie. I am highly disappointed, with the plot. The ending is so stupid, one can laugh. they saved all of that of the last 15 minutes, and suddenly a creep movie becomes a alien movie."

","I would love to spoil this so you won't waste your time. I wouldn't read something with spoilers before watching, so I won't. <br/><br/>First of all, do not believe any of those high reviews out there, they must be clueless. This film leads the viewer through an interesting story line. The acting is very good. John Goodman is incredible. The first hour or so will keep people on the edge of the seat. Then, out of the blue, everything goes straight to hell. It was as if the writers' child got hold of the script and finished it. The ending completely negates the entire story-line. It leaves the viewer questioning what the entire film even meant (and not in a good way). Some films have twists and turns that will leave the viewer with questions for discussion at the end. This film attempts to do that, but the only discussion to be had, is how this film can be made while so many good films are left in the dust. This film was actually upsetting. Maybe their plan was to make a film that made zero sense, and contradicted itself in the end. If so, congratulations. Also congratulations on forcing me to make my first review on this site. I just had to help warn others. <br/><br/>*and if you do decide to watch, do yourself a favor and turn it off before it's too late.<br/><br/>**I also had no idea this was some sort of sequel(?) to the movie Cloverfield, so keep that in mind."
"leonblackwood","5","2","4","22 October 2016"," Original was better! 5/10
","Review: This movie is definitely 2 stories in one! The first half is about a teenage girl, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who wakes up in a bunker, handcuffed to a bed, after being in a severe car accident. Whilst being tied about against her will, Howard, (John Goodman) tries to convince her that he is trying to save her life because the air is polluted and earth has been attacked by aliens but Michelle doesn't believe a word of it. Also in the bunker is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who actually fought to get in the bunker after witnessing strange supernatural activity on earth. After a while, Michelle and Emmett start to investigate the bunker, and they find weird information about Howard, which just doesn't add up. Michelle then tries to put together a suit, so she can survive in the polluted air but Howard is always 2 steps ahead. This the first part of the movie but then it switches to a human vs. Alien type movie, which is much better than the intriguing beginning. The second part of the movie seemed rushed, which is a shame because the intensity was brilliant. The bunker element was a bit slow and there wasn't a full explanation about Howard's behaviour. As there is only 3 characters in the movie, and there isn't much depth about there past, the performances had to be spot on for a movie like this to get the audience interested in the storyline, and I must admit, they did pull it off. Goodman was great as Howard and Mary played Michelle convincingly but there was way too many scenes in the bunker, which could have been easily taken out of the final cut. It's still a watchable movie which cover many elements of a horror/thriller but the first movie had the intensity from the beginning to end. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This is the first movie directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who had a big task after the success of the first movie, which was directed by Matt Reeves. With J.J. Abrams back in the producers chair, along with Matt Reeves, they chose to take the Cloverfield franchise in a different direction with this movie but they stuck with the ""Aliens destroying earth"" concept. It's hard to say if Howard was a good, or bad guy, because his intentions were innocent but he had this shady past and some of his actions were unnecessary. Anyway, I really enjoyed the ending, and I thought the weird looking alien creature, was original and pretty scary but I personally was expecting more from this sequel, especially after waiting so long for the sequel.<br/><br/>Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $110million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/horror/mystery/sci-fi/thrillers, starring John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Gallagher Jr., Douglas M. Griffin and Suzanne Cryer. 5/10"
"MDavenp900","6","2","4","30 August 2016"," An Unfortunate Mistake
","Great suspense, Goodman doing an excellent job portraying a man with compulsions, preparing the viewer all the way.<br/><br/>Was he as crazy as it appears? Was there a very different, unsavory purpose in bringing the pretty young Michelle to his bunker? His story itself seemed quite implausible. Still, there was the woman begging for help. There was the scratches on the window spelling out exactly that word. Could he have set all of that up? But what about his daughter, and what really happened to her? Lots of questions, and no answers.<br/><br/>And then the blunder.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***<br/><br/>Watch it first, or you won't understand, and even then you may disagree, but the movie was 5 minutes too long. The point of the story was simple. Howard claimed something terrible had happened on earth, Michelle didn't believe him. After several failed attempts, she succeeds in reaching the outdoors. Serene, peaceful, birds seen in their migratory formation. Ripping off her homemade gas mask, Michelle's thoughts can easily be read. ""He lied to us! He lied to us!"" And then in the distance a noise coming from the sky.<br/><br/>At first it is difficult to tell what we are seeing, but as it approaches, it is clearly not any craft we have ever seen before. Lines are dropped from it, and alien creatures descend, no more than a few feet from the terrified Michelle.<br/><br/>Cut to a closeup, Michelle screaming in horror. Cut to black. Roll the credits.<br/><br/>That is the way it should have ended. Minus 2 stars for certain for the writers' and director's failure to know when to stop, when enough is enough. What a shame."
"Mr-Fusion","5","2","4","21 July 2016"," Well, at least it's not found footage
","I've never seen the original ""Cloverfield"", but it was the cover image of John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead that sold me on the sequel. At the time, that seemed like a can't-lose. Ehhhh . . .<br/><br/>I will say, first and foremost, that the movie suffers from having to tie in to the original. That last 15 minutes or so does its best to wreck this movie and any suspense that's preceded it. Awful ending.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, yeah, it's a thriller, but only if you accept that subtlety has no place here. It's a young woman being held captive in an underground bunker (either by fallout overhead or her imbalanced captor), and I did want her to escape and gain closure in the end. But it's the journey thereto that wasn't very fun. I really wanted to like this because I really do like the two leads - and, credit where it's due, Goodman's casting was a stroke of genius here - but you can start to see the twists coming before they actually do, and that does get old. It's not a good script. I would recommend this if you like claustrophobic movie-making and eye candy (this does well on both counts) but it'll leave a sour aftertaste.<br/><br/>5/10"
"arosen-13","5","2","4","15 July 2016"," a faulty marriage of horror and sci-fi
","90% of this movie is a dungeon horror story, with all the classic elements such as psychological abuse and escape attempts. And then when the horror tale is done, the film escalates into sci fi. I wish it stayed one way or the other. I had a hard time maintaining suspension of disbelief because of the mix-up. The acting is excellent however, and while the mood of the entire film is bleak, there is plenty of tension in every scene. The story does suffer from lack of dynamism due to a single location, which made me wonder if the writers wanted to create a powder keg of pressure by keeping everyone confined to one dungeon, but it made for boring setting in my opinion, with crawling through ventilation a perfunctory cliché. Overall, watchable."
"bob the moo","Null","2","4","2 July 2016"," Good in the moment even if not hugely satisfying overall
","Like the film Cloverfield, I only heard of this film from a trailer seen recently, and decided to give it a go despite knowing very little about it. This is how the film wants it, and how it works best; it does this itself from the start where we learn a little about Michelle but there join her in her disarray and unknown circumstances. Not knowing the picture outside the bunker or really inside it either, means that mostly you are intrigued by either. The use of music and direction within the bunker does owe a lot to Lost – in particular its juxtaposition of dated domesticity against a bigger picture of unknown dangers (maybe) – and it does work even if it is a bit familiar.<br/><br/>Mostly though it is the performances that make it work. Winstead and Gallagher are solidly convincing, but it is Goodman that feeds the tension. The old adage 'just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you' applies here, and his character is unsettling in the detail. The inner and outer stories don't totally satisfy in their specifics and their end-points, however just as the trailer works to hook you in, the film is good in any specific moment. Unfortunately those moments don't all work as well as one another, and they don't come together into a satisfying whole as you may wish.<br/><br/>In the end it does have the feeling of a well-constructed product, which benefits from smart casting, writing, production, and marketing – but not necessarily story-telling. It was still entertaining as I watched it, but it didn't really leave a lasting mark, and it isn't really inspiring a second viewing now that I know what it holds"

Till the very end that leaves you thinking - What?! <br/><br/>Honestly, giving a review without the spoilers or this movie is very hard. <br/><br/>So I would leave you'll to see this movie, experience the annoyance yet splendid movie that this is."
"KineticSeoul","8","2","4","17 June 2016"," More than meets the eye
","When I saw the 2008 ""Cloverfield"" movie I thought it was a simple found footage monster movie. But after watching ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" and watching some videos about the movies on youtube. There is actually quite a bit of details that went into the movies that I missed. And that the Cloverfield universe is actually expansive and there is more to it than meets the eye. So the whole scenario is from the perspective of Michelle who is unaware of the the situation she is in. And what is the motives of the people she encounters in the bunker after waking up. However as an audience you will feel that you are drawn into this world and into the claustrophobic atmosphere where most of this movie takes place in. All the actors did fine, but John Goodman put on one heck of a performance as this unsettling, unstable and intimidating guy. He is like a ticking time bomb and you just don't know which buttons will lead him to go haywire. When it comes to the plot, it really did a good job of building everything up while keeping certain things a mystery. After the first hour the tensions really start to fly. I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out exactly what was going on. This film I gotta say is the epitome of leaving so many loose ends and so many things not being explained. Kind of like the trailer for this movie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have respect for it for what it accomplished with the resources it had. It's better than the 2008 Cloverfield movie although this sequel doesn't have all that much to do with the 2008 Cloverfield movie. The movie was renamed Cloverfield to make this film more marketable after all from the original script. Anyways, lastly I give the movie props for having a female lead that actually makes some smart moves instead of constantly falling down and making decisions that don't make any sense.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"serpent_coil","5","2","4","14 June 2016"," Better as a thriller than a sci fi
","Just to clarify, I watched this movie without knowing it was a spiritual sequel to Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Anyway, the majority of the movie isn't at all sci-fi but rather a claustrophobic, psychological thriller. And a quite good one at that. The acting and characters are well fleshed out and are believable and likable. Despite the confined space the story engages and always seems bigger then the setting. The plot twists and turns but never in a way that seems contrived and as a viewer you're always guessing and never knowing what's real and what isn't <br/><br/>I found myself quite engaged in the plot and characters. Emmet is quite likable and given just enough back-story to be made human and worth caring about. The writing makes you really care about him and paints him out as a really nice guy which is why his death makes so much more of an impact. Howard morphs from psychopath to teddy bear right back to psychopath seamlessly and Michelle works just fine for most of the film. So approaching the end I was positively surprised and in my head starting to think it was a solid 8/10 or even a 9/10 film. <br/><br/>That was before the rather disappointing and over-done ending that kind of spoiled it for me. I guess they felt they had to include more references to the original Cloverfield but I really think the movie suffers from it. The transition from psychological thriller to action sic-fi is about as subtle as a kick in the nuts. So suddenly our protagonist Michelle turns into Rambo and blows up an alien ship with a molotov cocktail and then goes off to join the resistance. <br/><br/>A shame really because the first 95% of the movie is really solid and stands on its own without any references to Cloverfield. With a little more subtlety when wrapping the film up it could have been truly great."

"glennmeerten06","8","2","4","30 March 2016"," Defining a Cloverfield franchise
","When the trailer dropped for 10 Cloverfield Lane, it caught everyone by surprise. Nobody really knew if there were plans for a sequel to the 2008 film 'Cloverfield', let alone if they even began shooting for it. But then, out of the blue, we get this awesome trailer and everyone knew, this was going to be something special. And by god, it was. <br/><br/>THE PLOT<br/><br/>Michelle, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is a young woman who's on the run. Not from the authorities but from her troubled life. She gets into an accident and wakes up, chained to a wall in what turns out to be an underground bunker. She is being held there by Howard, portrayed by John Goodman. Howard claims there has been an attack, chemical or otherwise, and that he saved her from certain death. Michelle doesn't know what to believe and can only guess what Howard's real intentions are. She isn't Howard's only guest though. Emmet, brought to live by John Gallagher Jr., is the third wheel and it's this trio you'll be spending the entire film watching. The story is build up perfectly. It balances true suspense with genuine and upbeat moments. As a viewer, you're constantly put on a wrong track or left guessing because the twists and turns the story takes are masterfully executed. This only works because the film takes its time to build them up and because you're experiencing the story and this universe through Michelle's eyes only. You as a viewer only know and see what Michelle knows and sees which to me personally ads more suspense than knowing something the protagonist doesn't. <br/><br/>THE ACTING<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead really nailed this performance. She was likable, clever and strong. You really rooted for her because she could think on her feet and made really smart choices. You knew from fairly early on that if she would figure out what was going on or how to escape if need be, she only had her wits and strength to thank. Her own personal story really resonated with me and it made her a great all-round character. John Gallagher Jr. is a name I'll remember from now on. I wasn't familiar with his work but I'm impressed with his performance. He was more than a comical note in this film and had his own important contribution to the story. You really do care about him and his story. Finally, I have to talk about the absolute highlight of this film. John Goodman's performance is truly Oscar worthy. He just steals every scene he's in and knocks it out of his bunker and out of the park. He was terrifying, not just because of his size but because of his presence. He is a force to be reckoned with and the film ads so much to his character by doing all these subtle things: hearing his footsteps approach from a far, hearing his constant heavy breathing and taking time to show all the little nuances he put in his performance. <br/><br/>THE CINEMATOGRAPHY <br/><br/>Visually this film is absolutely brilliant. As said, the entire film is experienced through Michelle's perspective and the cinematography is dedicated to this perspective. The camera is always close to Michelle, looking over her shoulder or showing her in a close-up shot. The camera will only pull back when the tension subsides for a while, which is a very effective way to create this contrast. During the finale of the film, the camera pulls back in and never lets go of Michelle. The tension in this scene is therefor all the more gruesome. <br/><br/>THE SOUNDTRACK<br/><br/>The score for 10 Cloverfield Lane is great. It's not outstanding or Oscar worthy but it does help create tension. When competing with an outstanding script and an even better cast, it's hard for a score to compete and really stand out, which is a compliment for both the cast and the writers, more than it is a critique on the score itself.<br/><br/>THE NEGATIVES<br/><br/>Being called 10 Cloverfield Lane, is probably one of the biggest problems of this film. Many viewers and fans, myself included, were expecting a sequel or prequel to 'Cloverfield'. This is not the case. One could even argue that these films aren't taking place in the same universe. Going into this film I knew I wouldn't get a sequel because I did some research. Nevertheless, I kept waiting for the Cloverfield monster to turn up but it never did. The climax for this film will definitely satisfy most viewers and even fans but I can't deny that die-hard fans will be disappointed. But I believe I figured out what J.J. Abrams and his entourage were going for...<br/><br/>DEFINING A FRANCHISE<br/><br/>I believe that with this film, a franchise has been defined. Many people wanted it to be monster- or found footage franchise , but it turned out differently. From now on, an entry in the Cloverfield franchise will be a science fiction film, grounded in the real world and at the center of these films will be a disaster that takes place. In the first one we got a huge monster, rampaging through New York, in the second a possible chemical or nuclear attack that devastated the United States. Thinking about this, one can only wonder what the third film will be... However, nothing is certain at this point and seeing how Abrams fooled our expectations with 10 Cloverfield Lane, I wouldn't bet my head on me being right.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a masterfully executed, psychological thriller with stellar performances and great characters. It thrives on its tension and great writing and it keeps you guessing through the whole thing. It's a great film and even better one if you check your expectations at the door."

","No spoilers...don't worry. After watching Cloverfield, I first hated the shaky cam on purpose idea, but the theme of the movie got me. Then I watched Super8, which made me realize that JJ is actually a good storyteller. By not showing what is scary, he lets his actors and the story make people enjoy the film without demanding a monster after 10 minutes. Force Awakens was pretty much an ALL YOU CAN EAT Buffet of stories in movie world, so don't judge him for not being more original in that one. <br/><br/>10 Clov. Lane had enough of everything to give you a grin due Goodman's awesome acting, an eyebrow raise to the OOH Shoot moment and enough edge to expect more. Some people will probably say that WTF does this story have anything to do with the 1st. Hence my title, it is not just a sequel, nor a prequel. You can watch both in any order and you will enjoy both, in my opinion. 1 point to fix would be Emmet's character and perhaps the actor's take on it. He is first portrayed as someone dumb whitted, not knowing the difference between North and South Korea, but then later on figuring some stuff out and actually being smarter than he seemed. But it wasn't that kind of a movie to have a character that either A: develops into a smart young man or B: is secretive about who he really is. So the writers should have just have him stick with one side. The 2 leads were awesome, I really enjoyed the attention to detail in directing. After watching BatmanVsSouperman and just being tired of watching something that should have been better foreshadowed for 3 hours, this film uses almost every shot to it's benefit in the future. And one thing I can spoil you with is this : I hope and I think there will be a sequel. There has to be....you will see"

","'10 Cloverfield Lane', serves up the chills, suspense and ultimately the terror.<br/><br/>This movie has the eerie feel of that of a classic 'Hitchcock' film. The creepiness is first brought on by the incredible performance of John Goodman (Howard) who, if anyone else, couldn't bring this interesting character to life.<br/><br/>John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett) plays a humble and funny farm-hand trying to make the best out of a bad situation, and the beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) just happens to be the wrong girl in the wrong place at the wrong time, basically. They both have an interesting dynamic especially when they interact with the mysterious Howard. Winstead is ultimately the audience avatar as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>The two younger characters do have a number of tension filled scenes with Howard all the while contemplating just what is happening outside the bunker. All in all, it's Howard's word against there's as they all try to get along and abide by his strict rules. They basically ask the same question the audience will be asking; ""What is going on out there?""<br/><br/>Be warned though, the conclusion and answered questions will have viewers divided. Personally, what happens on the outside isn't as scary nor suspenseful as the events which take place with all three characters locked in the bunker.<br/><br/>If this is to be compared with 2007's 'Cloverfield', this film surpasses it massively and it gets an extra thumbs up from me just on the count that there is no use of the God-awful 'shaky-cam';)"

","The trailer for this film instantly caught my attention and it immediately planted a seed of doubt as to what was truly going on – who are the good guys and the bad guys? Who's telling the truth? The great thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is that the air of mystery transcends throughout the lifespan of the film – from the very limited information divulged from a very clever marketing campaign to the first two acts of the actual film, you are constantly questioning every aspect.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who you may remember from the 2011 remake of The Thing and (one of my personal favourites) Scott Pilgrim vs The World, plays Michelle and what an amazing performance. She's such a talented actress and this may be the first film where she will be truly recognised for her abilities. The movie opens with Michelle on the run, driving as far away as she can after what appears to be a dispute with her fiancée Ben. She is soon involved in a car crash and finds herself chained to a pipe in a dank basement. It's not long before she meets her captor (or saviour?) Howard – played by a chilling John Goodman. His character is a far cry from Dan Conner in Roseanne but his variety of roles lately have proved that he is a Hollywood heavyweight well- deserving of overdue praise.<br/><br/>From this point onwards, the film begins to play a frustrating game with our psyches – Howard claims that he has in fact saved Michelle after her accident from what might be a potentially fatal biohazardous attack. Michelle, however, has her reservations about what Howard's true intentions are and what I loved most about this movie is that it is a long time before you are really certain as to what's going on.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that the less you know, the better so I won't continue with any further information than this. My one qualm was with how the film ended but it's very minor compared to how much I truly enjoyed this insane thrill-ride that had me at the edge of my seat the entire time.<br/><br/>motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"

","I tend to enjoy writing spoiler reviews more than non-spoiler ones, however with this film I truly do not want to give anything away. I want everyone to have the same experience I did when I watched this film. Which is a good experience. Very good.<br/><br/>The premise at a glance is that Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is involved in a car accident after an argument with her boyfriend, and all of a sudden, she wakes up in an underground bunker being held by a man named Howard (John Goodman) who claims there has been some sort of chemical attack on the surface, and that it isn't safe to leave. However, Howard may not be the all the saviour he seems to be. That is all I'm going to say in regards to plot, as anything more would be considered a spoiler due to J.J. Abrams excellent marketing campaign similar to The Force Awakens: never give too much of the film away.<br/><br/>The beauty of this film was the unknown. I haven't watched Cloverfield (2008) for a good few years, and made the decision not to re-watch it before the 'sequel', in order to fully appreciate the film as an original. In fact, it is not really a sequel at all. If you go into this movie expecting raucous action you will not enjoy it; it is a claustrophobic, tension-filled thriller, and a movie in itself as opposed to a follow-up.<br/><br/>John Goodman steals the show. After watching some of his more comedic films like The Big Lebowski (1998), I thought perhaps that is the character I would see whenever he spoke, but that was not the case at all. Goodman is a phenomenal actor, and I believe this is some of his best work. He had the perfect believable balance between insanity and rationalism and is genuinely terrifying in the movie, on par with Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men (2007). You are never too sure whether he is bending the truth, telling the truth or lying, and as a viewer we explore much of this through Michelle and fellow bunker- bound Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). There was also much impressive acting on Winstead's behalf. The only other film I had seen her in was Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (2010), which is a fun movie, but doesn't flair up her acting capabilities as much as her performance in this flick. Her non-cheesy portrayal of what could have been the classic 'damsel in distress' was in fact extremely commendable. Playing the relatable character in the film, all of the choices she made were believable and thought-out, which is what many modern actions/dramas tend to lack, leaving the viewer thinking who in their right mind would do that? <br/><br/>As Chris Stuckmann noted in his brilliant review, the film didn't feel like it had to become bigger than the one it shares a name with (NOT a sequel). The studio in fact did the exact opposite, creating the movie solely from a very small set of perhaps five rooms within the underground bunker. This impressed me as it meant the film relied completely on the characters and dialogue, which was a bold move for debut director Dan Trachtenberg. The score composed by Bear McCreary was also compelling and very much added to the darker scenes, in both senses of the word. I particularly enjoyed the sudden changes in tone whenever Howard entered a room or spoke, a small aspect that can often completely change a scene subconsciously.The lack of music in particular scenes also worked in adding tension and uncertainty to the film.<br/><br/>My only criticism of the film, and even here I have to think about it, is that the ending could be seen as rushed. Without spoiling anything, the 'reveal', as it were, was eloquently done, however that wasn't the strong point of the film. The acting and dialogue indefinitely compromised for this minor critique, and I would recommend that you see this film as soon as possible to avoid it being spoiled!"
"mh37434","9","2","4","28 March 2016"," Better than the first film in the Cloverfield franchise
","There are few films that I can honestly say are quite brilliant. This movie had so many layers to it, one can't help but love it. Even if you're not into sci-fi like me, you'll probably like it because it's a thriller and exciting.<br/><br/>The movie is the second Cloverfield film, but there's no apparent connection to the first film at all, which indicates it takes place in a different universe or timeline, but it's still science fiction. So I guess that the Cloverfield franchise is similar to The Twilight Zone. One could theorize a way that this film could be connected to the last film, but it's all just speculation more than anything. It doesn't really matter, because this is still an entirely different story.<br/><br/>The first film I saw in theaters when it first came out, I was more interested in seeing the Star Trek teaser trailer than the movie itself, and the movie was filmed in a way that made me feel incredibly sick. I never watched it again, but it was a cool story.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie is better, it's filmed like a traditional film for one thing. This is John Goodman's best work by the way. The movie presents so many questions. I just loved it. Especially considering there was next to nobody in the cast, just four people in the whole movie I think. Not counting the photographs.<br/><br/>Anyway, unlike the first movie, which was a monster film, this is an alien invasion story. Actually that's not even right. It's a story about a man who kidnaps a girl...that's not right...I really don't know what the movie is about, I just know it's awesome! Watch it..."
"eskwarczynski","9","2","4","21 March 2016"," An intense, claustrophobic thriller that will make even the veteran movie-goer squirm in their seat.
","It's difficult to review a film like 10 Cloverfield Lane because the film is best experienced when the viewer has no earthly idea what it is about. So in this very short review, I simply plead with you to go see this movie if you haven't already. It's a well- crafted thriller that grabs a hold of you and never lets go. <br/><br/>I can't remember the last time a movie had me on the edge of my seat like this. The beautifully eerie cinematography and perfect score by Bear Mcreary (The Walking Dead) set the foundation for the suspenseful ride that is, 10 Cloverfield Lane. John Goodman gives an Academy Award level performance that is generally unexpected in this type of movie. Mary Elisabeth Winstead plays one of the greatest protagonists in recent memory for a horror/thriller picture. (She's come a long way as an actress since Final Destination 3!) This film also brings John Gallagher, Jr. to my attention for the first time - not counting Jonah Hex, because I remember nothing from that awful movie - anyway, I wouldn't be surprised if he became a household name in the next few years. There were no weak links in the cast.<br/><br/>The suspense in the movie builds quickly but steadily, never over-working itself or feeling as though the director is rushing to get to the next scare. The movie taunts you and misdirects you over and over, until what I believed to be an incredible climax. Apparently some were not thrilled with the ending, although I think it was perfect. However, in the end, it doesn't matter. <br/><br/>Watching the characters develop and this terrifying plot unfold is such a satisfying journey that no matter how you feel about the ending of the film, you'll be glad you were a part of the ride that took you there."

","The film keeps you guessing for quite a while and I found it very watchable. It left me wanting more. <br/><br/>Is Howard just a nut? or is he a little deranged because it is the end of the world? <br/><br/>Who exactly is Emmett? Why is Michell there? Who is/are the bad guy(s) or are they outside?<br/><br/>The acting and build up for suspense works very well in the first half of the film. <br/><br/>Midway though I felt it lost a bit of steam. It seemed rather 'forced' the way Howard was discovered to have abducted a girl (who was never seen again) and suddenly he was an out and out monster. <br/><br/>Shortly after he executes Emmett and Michell flees for her life. <br/><br/>The film then picks up speed again and follows Michell as she manages to escape outside.<br/><br/>I was left wanting to know more detail on the 'invasion'. I felt they could have given a bit more time for us to explore the world outside the bunker. <br/><br/>Having said that, the sign of a good book or film, is you want to know more! ......... I definitely did. <br/><br/>Worth a watch, 7.5/10<br/><br/>p.s. Howard spend years preparing his bunker but the air filtration controls only accessible by wriggling thru an air vent.WTF!!!"
"philipmorrison-73118","8","2","4","20 March 2016"," Don't go into bunkers with strangers
","First, this movie didn't have any apparent connection to the 2008 film ""Cloverfield"", so it can stand on its own. I can't write this review without some major spoilers, so if you want to be surprised, don't read this. With that said, here we go. It was like they took two movies and spliced them together. 80% of the movie goes one way, and then the last part is just radically different. I was worried that this film would drag, but was pleasantly surprised to find enough plot twists to keep me intrigued. I'm going to give credit for that totally to John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. The interaction between the two of them is both funny and frightening. In several scene's, Mary has this glaring stare that says, ""What the hell""? I know I was saying it right along with her and it was awesome. Add to that John Gallagher Jr.'s role as the mild manner boy next door who is just trying to survive and you have a 3 person cast that was just outstanding. The overall plot is fairly simple, a young woman wakes up from a car accident to find she's in an underground bunker with someone who could very well be insane telling her that the outside world is under attack and the safest thing you could do is not get out, but to stay in. With no supporting information and the fact that her savior is probably a serial killer, she desperately seeks a way to get out, but is the outside really safer?"

","I loved the trailer to this movie when I saw it and was incredibly pumped and I just got back from seeing it and it was incredible, a part from the ending, which I will get into, it doesn't ruin the movie but it was a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>The acting from everyone was great, they really made you believe they were these people and were in this situation. The characters were engaging and the chemistry between the three actors was very good.<br/><br/>The score was also superb and it really added to the tense atmosphere. The first 20 minutes or so is mostly score, and when it stops it really makes the silence in the film more impactful and added to the tension. The story is intriguing and you don't know what is going to happen next. It is never boring and is paced really well. At each major plot point the film just gets more and more interesting.<br/><br/>And the cinematography is rather good. Especially at the beginning of the film, the camera moves around Mary Elizabeth Winsteads room and it focuses on certain objects and her facial expressions, this tells you visually what is going on in her life, there is no need for dialogue and it was very well done.<br/><br/>Overall it's a very engaging, tense, unpredictable and clever movie that is now one of my favourite movies of all time, I love movies like this. Films that have an interesting plot and have incredibly engaging characters. And I love tense movies as well, they are the films that get me the most emotionally involved and this film certainly gets me involved.<br/><br/>The only problem with it, is the ending."
"tjgoalie13","8","2","4","18 March 2016"," Tense, and Unpredictable
","10 Cloverfield Lane had a few appealing features, but didn't seem as though it was poised to be as good as it was. Seeing the trailer the film looked odd, as it was a sequel to a found-footage disaster movie that was set in one location amongst only 3 characters. 10 Cloverfield Lane is tensely confining, well-written, and takes the franchise in a totally different direction. That being said this film could have been great if it had not been part of the cloverfield franchise, however it also did well within that universe.<br/><br/>The film is very tense, similar to last year's Room, in that it's very confining and isolated. The film benefits from good performances all around, but most notably that of John Goodman who plays the sympathetic yet deranged Howard. Goodman's cold yet soft performance helps build tension as the character clearly controls the situation, but is unpredictable and often erratic. With a brilliantly dark and somewhat nightmarish tone, the film plays out like a human version of mice in a rigged maze.<br/><br/>The story in the film is unpredictable and very well written, most likely due to the fact that ""Whiplash"" writer and director Damien Chazelle co-wrote the script. The story unfolds with one twist after another, with each twist bigger than the last, until the film builds into its climax perfectly. Another element that was very well done was the character development, as each character is well-rounded, and given a good arc. With a good story and great characters 10 Cloverfield Lane is a well-written sequel to Cloverfield, that even improves upon its predecessor.<br/><br/>One thing to note, while it may seem obvious, 10 Cloverfield Lane is very different from Cloverfield. Where Cloverfield was a found-footage disaster film with a huge scope, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very confined traditionally shot thriller about people trapped in a bunker. That being said fans of the original may not be as fond of 10 Cloverfield Lane, whereas some who disliked Cloverfield may enjoy 10 Cloverfield Lane. However, they are very different films, with 10 Cloverfield Lane more focused on character development, and drama.<br/><br/>In the end, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a well crafted thriller, that delivers, mostly due to great writing. The film is very tense, well-acted, well-written,unpredictable, and very different from its predecessor in size and scope. The end result is a great film that is in many ways better than the original Cloverfield, because of the effort and care of the people making it. For those that love tense thrillers, or just in general great films, this film will surely entertain."
"themadmovieman","9","2","4","18 March 2016"," Stunning
","Well, I don't think I've come out of a film with a face as white as a sheet for a long time, but 10 Cloverfield Lane really did exactly that. An exceptionally well-directed film that's full of mystery, twists and chilling suspense, this film is incredibly enthralling at almost every moment.<br/><br/>And that's even more impressive when you take into account that this whole film basically takes place on one set. There's a little set-up outside the bunker for the first five minutes or so (five minutes that instantly prove what an amazing film this is going to be), but apart from that, 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the most claustrophobic and intense thrillers in years.<br/><br/>I thought Dan Trachtenberg's directing here was fantastic. He manages to keep the rather slow-paced story that unfolds in this confined space brilliantly fascinating, and as the film gradually reveals small morsels of information about what's really going on, he increases the tension fantastically, keeping you right on the edge of your seat until the bitter end.<br/><br/>What's more is that the performances were stunning. Only three actors appear in this film throughout, but they're all amazing. In the lead role, Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives what is easily her best performance ever, full of deep fear, dread and confusion, whilst John Gallagher Jr. impresses in the smallest role. However, it's John Goodman that really stands out. He's brilliant as the man who runs the ship below ground in the bunker. Unpredictable at every moment, sometimes appearing comforting and honest, and sometimes being genuinely terrifying, but what's most impressive is that he's always thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>The plot is the most interesting part of this film to talk about and discuss afterwards. The film, unlike its predecessor, the big monster movie Cloverfield, is a calm, collected psychological thriller. It's all about the desperation to discover whether this woman has really been rescued from a devastating attack, or if there's something more sinister going on. Believe me, there's no way to tell which way it's leaning in this film, but that's testament to how well-written, directed and acted it is, and by the end, you'll be biting your nails, hanging off the edge of your seat, hiding behind the sofa and all that as the film snowballs to an astonishing (albeit undoubtedly controversial) conclusion.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the ending, apart from the fact that I loved it. I can see some people being confused about how this film finishes, but I was blown away by both the plot direction and the sudden shift in tone, and that was what really stunned me to the point where I felt so scared.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved 10 Cloverfield Lane. It's not your average thriller, but something deeply more intelligent and dark. It's an exceptionally thrilling watch, and with three brilliant performances, a stunningly unpredictable plot and amazing directing."
"mexicospidergreen","9","2","4","17 March 2016"," A refreshing and suspenseful white-knuckle thriller
","Throughout the first 80 minutes of this movie, I was widely grinning over the fact that I had just witnessed my second serving of sheer cinematic perfection following Zootopia. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a perfectly crafted and carefully executed attempt at reviving the thriller genre, and it does so with rewarding thought and exceptional creativity. Like all the classic entries in the genre, this one is suspenseful till the point where it becomes unsettling and features a consistent and bona-fide tone of fear from the creepy atmosphere to the sense of paranoia present at every corner and the sense of claustrophobia that will stick with you weeks after seeing the movie. What you can appreciate most about it its desire to sustain the audience's momentum with intelligence and concern until the disappointing and buzz-killing finale.<br/><br/>The riveting screenplay, written to palpably tense perfection by a team of accomplished screenwriters serves a further reminder of how much character and dialogue development contributes to a film, and really makes you appreciate the amount of process and effort put into writing a screenplay. The enthralling and impressive direction by first time director Dan Trachtenberg and the refreshingly beautiful steady cam cinematography offers a uniquely immersive experience as the audience is thrust into the sustained and confined space that the characters are in. The musical score by TV composer Bear McCreary immediately puts you in the moment from the opening second, and contributes to the credibility of certain situations as they start to weigh in. If that wasn't enough to satisfy your cravings, we also get a surprising amount of character development on the two main characters and a pair of dynamic performances from two bona-fide actors that simply chose to give a crap and go the extra mile in contributing to the authenticity of the film.<br/><br/>Let's begin with analyzing the female protagonist played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, in a role that will make her a household name. What impressed me the most is that protagonist is more than your clichéd and stereotypical damsel in distress type character, which makes root for the character and invest enough spirit in her to care about her struggle to escape. She's a thinker who will use everything in her knowledge and training to survivethink Mark Watney from The Martian meets Lara Croft Tomb Raider. Winstead is sensational in this film, and so is the character which she was born to inhabit. Her dedication to the character is evident as she vanishes into the role by displaying every range of emotion so eloquently that you instantly believe that she's in this shuddery and paralyzed state she's so desperately trying to escape from. Equally as phenomenal is John Goodman who's as bizarre, manipulative, and frightening as he's ever been on screen. Goodman's presence is so commanding here that even though his character isn't necessarily a character you'd want to root for, you leave the theater haunted, yet grateful to have seen such a dark, committed, and transcendent performance.<br/><br/>Sounds like the perfect movie right? It would be, if not for the disastrous final act which we'll revert back to right now. To give you a spoiler-free sense of the final act, imagine that you're a university student writing your final essay; your professor is so impressed by the sophisticated beginning and middle portion, that he's already aching to award you an ""A+"", and he hasn't even finished reading the entire paper. Then when you reach your final body, your talents start to descend leading to a disappointing finale due to change in tone or lack of trying, that kills all the potential displayed before the final body leading up to your conclusion. That should give you an idea of how lazy the finale is.<br/><br/>Until the final act though, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an adrenaline-fueled adventure anchored by exceptional direction and two legitimately credible performances. The screenwriters deserve an enormous amount of credit for crafting such a riveting, inspired, and mysterious project and depicting wit, tension, and fear through dialogue in a screenplay that reminds us of why characters and dialogue are the two most fundamental factors in writing a screenplay. The focused and devoted direction by Trachtenberg demonstrates why he's a filmmaker with a force to be reckoned with, and foreshadows a critically-acclaimed future for the first time director. Winstead hits a new career peak and her dedication to portraying her character as humanly as possible is something that instantly commands our attention and regard. Goodman further demonstrates why he's one of the most cherished actors of his generation with yet another unrestrained, bravura performance. All these factors contributed perfectly into the construction of an invigorating psychological thriller, and despite the finale being a complete mess, 10 Cloverfield Lane is smart, inspired, and solidly crafted cinema for movie-goers."
"lmaldarella","10","2","4","17 March 2016"," A psychological exercise in thrill
","A follow up to 2008's ""Cloverfield"", this film was originally not a sequel and in my opinion works just as well on its own. <br/><br/>The story follows Michelle, who seems to be running from her problems. After being involved in a violent accident (or, was it?) on a dark road, she wakes up in an underground cellar, chained to the wall. Enter a masterfully creepy John Goodman who claims that the apocalypse is upon us, and he is doing her a service by allowing her to stay in his doomsday bunker. Things aren't as clear as all that.<br/><br/>The technical elements are well-done, but to be expected in a J.J. Abrams film. It is not, however, Michael Bay on one extreme, and it's not Steven Spielberg. The scenes flow together in a way that keeps us hooked and guessing the entire time. The cinematography can feel claustrophobic, and purposefully so. Ultimately, it all comes together effectively.<br/><br/>I have not seen the first Cloverfield film yet, so I will wait out of fairness to compare the two. I can say based off of what I know of the 2008 film, that this is more of an anthology than a sequel. It works beautifully as a stand alone, but for fans expecting a monster masher, this will disappoint. It's a psychological guessing game and a character study of 3 different people more than anything else. <br/><br/>The ending, which I will not spoil, is unpredictable and kept at arms length until the the last 10-15 minutes of the film at which point it hits you head on. While unpredictable, some may look back and see that it's obvious what was coming, but that should not diminish the experience during the film. <br/><br/>This film is a masterpiece of suspense, I was literally on the edge of my seat from the first 5 minutes. Although lighthearted moments are employed, these only serve to add to the feeling of fear and the knowledge of the coming dread, whatever form that takes. During such scenes, I was not able to sit back and relax; I was preparing myself for what I knew was lying in wait."

This film not only contains great acting and directing, but also great cinematography as well as stunning visual and sound effects. The movie also has a riveting screenplay that conveys so many emotions while still being a great story. This is a great film that I would highly recommend for anyone who loves thrillers, suspenseful films, intense films, and just all around great films.

For this I was tempted to go below a 7 because it was not what I was expecting, and there were parts that were not needed. In fact, without them it would have been close to a 10. Therefore, it had to be a 7.<br/><br/>Caution: This is not a sci fi movie... except for a fraction of it. It's mostly drama with a little thriller.<br/><br/>I'm going to add some spoilers further along, but not yet. First I'll say that if you have seen the preview you at least know that for a while there are some people in a small area/room/place. This part of the movie is great. In fact, that is where I would rate the movie at its absolute strongest. The characters interacted well, the drama was there, the small intense parts were enjoyable, and there was mystery to what was going on.<br/><br/>Now for the spoilers: The people were down there for a little too long if they wanted this to be related to Cloverfield in any way. They should have been down there for no longer than 45 minutes of the movie, then the real movie should have began. However, because they were down there so long, then maybe Cloverfield should not have been in the title so as not to confuse people? If you watch this movie you will not be seeing a movie with an alien presence... mostly. And (here comes the big spoiler) when she finally escapes just end the movie. We're done, no more was required. The strange unexplained 10 minutes of alien presence was useless. Silly. Strange. Sure we now know what sent them underground, but it was not needed. Leave it for the sequel maybe?<br/><br/>Overall, yes, see the movie and enjoy it as a dram a with some frantic chills. Don't expect any real info on the alien invasion.

"samgiannn","8","2","4","12 March 2016"," 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)
","First, this isn't a sequel to Cloverfield nor does it take place in the same universe as Cloverfield, so if you go see this, don't get mad that the Clover monster isn't ripping through the city again. Now that that's out of the way, this is going to be a completely spoiler-free review, unless you don't want to know about, um, character names. But seriously, the less you know about this movie, the better, so I'm not going to give anything away that wasn't in any of the trailers. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, a woman, Michelle, gets in a car accident and wakes up in an underground bunker. Her captor, Howard claims to have saved her life and that everyone outside the bunker is dead. Another man is also in the bunker, named Emmet, and tensions arise between the three as Howard becomes increasingly suspicious, and Emmet and Michelle mount an escape plan. While Cloverfield, was an intense, in-your-face monster flick, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a completely different beast altogether. Instead of the vast area of New York City, this movie takes place in the confines of a doomsday bunker, so the scares come from paranoia and suspense than a giant monster attacking the city. All three cast members are excellent in their roles, especially John Goodman as Howard. His awesomely creepy performance makes this one of his most memorable roles. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Galleger Jr. are incredible as well. You may recognize her as Wendy from Final Destination 3. Winstead's character definitely isn't a damsel in distress here; Michelle is crafty and smart like Nancy from A Nightmare on Elm Street. John Galleger Jr. also provides some witty comic relief while also seeming a bit suspicious himself. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a restrained, suspenseful and well-crafted psychological thriller that calls to mind both Misery and The Twilight Zone, and if this anthology series continues, it'll be hard to match the standards set by this and its predecessor."
"alexrwatson-888-169026","9","2","4","11 March 2016"," Suspenseful Storytelling at its Finest
","10 Cloverfield Lane came out of nowhere. The film was shot under a different title and did not receive a trailer until less than two months from its theatrical release. Because of the secrecy surrounding its production and the lack of details surrounding the film's plot, I will be very careful about what I say and do not say about 10 Cloverfield Lane. Basically, the film is about a woman who wakes up in a bomb shelter after being in a car accident and finds herself under the care of a suspicious man named Howard. 10 Cloverfield Lane uses precise storytelling to tell an astonishingly intense and mysterious story that left me gasping for air and brimming with excitement over how excellent this film turned out to be.<br/><br/>To avoid spoilers, I'll keep my comments on 10 Cloverfield Lane's story fairly vague. After Michelle wakes up and is with the stranger Howard, she has no idea whether anything this man is saying about the circumstances of her being there are true or not. So the audience, much like Michelle, is using every detail, in every frame, to put together what is actually going on in this bomb shelter. This makes for a very engaging experience because the viewer is constantly using updated information to decide whether or not to trust Howard.<br/><br/>The film also does not explain everything through dense exposition; the film gives the viewer most (but not all) the pieces to the puzzle and allows the viewer do some of the mental work. The screenwriters Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken, and Damien Chazelle (Whiplash writer/director) did a fantastic job of creating a really interesting mystery for the viewers to actively participate in.<br/><br/>This mystery would not be nearly as interesting if it was not heightened by suspense. John Goodman plays Howard, and he brings an intensity to the role that makes him incredibly imposing on screen with Michelle and Emmett (the other person in the bomb shelter). Howard's short temper combined with his unknown backstory, make every one of Michelle and Emmett's encounters with Howard even more intense than the last. The best way I can describe the intensity of this movie is imagine being locked in a room that is slowly filling with smoke. At first it's breathable, but as time goes on, your lungs begin filling with smoke, and eventually you are gasping for dear life.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane never lets you get too comfortable, but at the same time, does not skimp out on character development. Michelle is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and while at first she plays a cliché, helpless heroine, she develops into much more than that. Her character arc feels natural, and her arc gives the film an emotional thread I was not expecting. John Gallagher Jr. is likable as Emmett, but Winstead and Goodman really standout with their outstanding performances.<br/><br/>While J.J. Abrams' name is all over the trailers and promotions, do not let that fool you; he only produced the film. I'm actually glad he not direct 10 Cloverfield Lane, not because he would not have done a great job, but because it gave Dan Trachtenberg a chance to direct his first feature film. Every director strives for it, but only great directors have it: and that's style. It's one of those things you know it when you see it, and Trachtenberg certainly has it. This guy is going to be getting a lot of work after his excellent job on 10 Cloverfield Lane. Keep your eyes on what Trachtenberg does next.<br/><br/>This thriller does take a big turn in a different direction at a point in the film, but I loved the turn overall and truly felt like the film earned this payoff. I have one complaint with this switch the film takes, but even being vague about this detail would give too much away. I will say the last shot is one my favorite final shots to a film ever.<br/><br/>I went into 10 Cloverfield Lane knowing nothing (not even seeing one trailer), and I was wonderfully surprised. The film's many twists and turns are meant to be experienced in the theater, so go out and see it before anyone else can dampen your individual movie-going experience. 10 Cloverfield Lane is the first great film of 2016; it slowly ramps up the tension, scene by scene, until it's nearly unbearable, before eventually revealing that monsters indeed come in many forms.<br/><br/>If you liked this review, check out my websites for other reviews and movie articles www.watsonmoviereviews.com"

","For those who might think that this is not going to be their kind of movie, take a chance, grab some popcorn, and lose yourself. Well-written, well-directed, and well-acted. If you like the unexpected, you will enjoy 10 Cloverfield Lane.I promise you that as long as you don't read spoilers, you really won't know where this is going at virtually any point in the movie. That is the definition of a well-constructed, enjoyable film. You go along for a journey with the three actors who make up the entire film. It is both fascinating from a film study standpoint and mesmerizing at times from an audience standpoint. There are plenty of reviews you can look at for clues or insights or spoilers. My suggestion is resist: sit down in the theater with as blank a slate as possible and go for the ride."
"CinePendejo","7","2","4","13 March 2016"," Good enough until it ended (You did it again, Abrams!)
","I will be honest, during the time that CLOVERFIELD dominated the hype media back in 2007, I didn't care all that much. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see it and it maintains as good as I thought it would be, but man did the marketing got out of control. For all the time people speculated about the title, the tag line ""1-18-2008"", and constant ludicrous theories, I somehow became the minority when I kept saying ""It is just a Monster movie BLAIR WITCH style! Get over yourselves!"" I didn't even bother to care what I thought the monster actually looked like, which I apparently was also the minority on among the utterly disappointed audience who saw nothing more than just a giant lizard. As for me, I liked it enough. Sure the overall payoff sorely needed, there was really some dumb moments, and the overall film almost swayed into Overrated territory, but it still hold enough for me as far as monster movies BLAIR WITCH style goes. <br/><br/>With that being said, it is no surprise that I would also have mixed feelings with its ""blood relative"" 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE. The first 90 minutes is a solid mix of elaborate problem-solving and an even darker spin on the people-trapped-in-a-room scenario (think ROOM but in the room throughout the movie), while the last part is... underwhelming to say the least. <br/><br/>And it is at this point that we really could have seen this coming, especially from a Bad Robot production company. I would be the last to know how the whole JJ Abrams ""mystery box"" marketing for his movies actually works for me, but I would be the first to elaborate how obnoxious it gets while trying. There is a level of patronization with the conceit of playing with my expectations and having the whole thing turn up like I always thought it would be the whole time, and I HIGHLY doubt that I am on the minority on the issue. Sure, a movie as good otherwise as THE FORCE AWAKENS or even CLOVERFIELD would dismiss it entirely, but this does conjure a lot of unfulfilled expectations that might taint these films despite their quality. <br/><br/>But to the story. A woman named Michelle is held under supervision in an underground bunker by the man of Howard (John Goodman), who claims to save her from an impending danger up on the surface. Throughout the movie, we explore her interacting with both him and another guy while they, or rather the film, constantly hints at said impending danger that I, frankly, already know about fro the title. Things gradually get hostile with Howard, who may or may not be a closet psychopath, and the two other people find ways to piece together what is going on, and evidently escape only to face a pretty underwhelming ending. <br/><br/>The movies strong points is definitely when the main characters are in the bunker. Outside of mystery teasing and Howard's creepy dual nature, the script manages to bring out these characters outside of their blank-state traits. Michelle in particular is the most well- rounded of them all, as we first see her running away from personal issues only to have her think multiple ways to solve them instead throughout the movie. What was once a confused, frail woman slowly but surely shifts into a bold, outward-thinking protagonist within the confines of her unfamiliar surroundings. Sadly, the other guy (John Gallagher Jr) just doesn't grow into me other than some dude trying to be funny.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, it is John Goodman who steals the show. What once framed as either kind-hearted, dignified, or just an everyman, his role might be his biggest and darkest turn for what otherwise could've been a tired crazy man stock character. Menacing and aggressive at one point, but dignified and collective in the next. He is also just a joy to watch, stealing almost every scene where he gets to lose his marbles! Had this film tanked in any way, he might still be worth at least one viewing.<br/><br/>Heck, even the director earns great credit here. After enjoying these 90 minutes, I am certainly keeping track of Dan Trachtenberg for now on. He follows this film with a Portal short called NO ESCAPE, and boy does it resonate just as well here. The film is somehow structured like some sort of puzzle-solving point-and-click game where the main character finds elaborate ideas and inventions to progress the story. He certainly gets this down to the tee, as well as a good eye for composition, chilling still-shots, and making claustrophobic tunnel crawling instantly engaging. For all the films based on simple sets, it is quite a feat to draw us into every punch, scream, and chase scene leading up to the big ending...<br/><br/>...And then the ending happened, and the quality all dips down to ""meh"". Without spoiling, the point at which one of the main characters steps outside of the bunker sorely disconnected me. Not only does it drag and quickly skews over to ridiculous territory, it was basically a payoff that I already expected. Seriously, if you have seen CLOVERFIELD and got fooled by the trailers into thinking of something more, you really need to check yourself. Not only that, but it feels completely distant from the other parts of the movie, as if JJ Abrams was saying instead of calling it a ""blood relative,"" he meant to say ""Look. This had nothing to do with CLOVERFIELD, so we decided to drop the name in to help the director sell more tickets!"" <br/><br/>Above all else, the movie is quite simply solid enough for recommendation, even though it could've been more tight with the ending, the stuff before is so good that I can't fault this merely for unmet expectations<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 (GOOD)"
"johnplocar","8","2","4","12 March 2016"," A solid thriller that had me hooked all the way through...
","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" may or may not be a sequel to 2008's ""Cloverfield"" or even possibly in the same continuity, that is never made clear but is unnecessary because this is a stand-alone film that is tense from the start. There may be Easter-eggs scattered throughout that connects the two, I have no clue, but it really doesn't matter to me because this movie doesn't need to be a part of the same universe as ""Cloverfield"". I am 100% satisfied with this secluded thriller that I watched last night all on its own. <br/><br/>The film opens with a young woman, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, driving out to the country side while all is seemingly right with the world around her. After her car is hit and knocked off the road she wakes up to a man, John Goodman, claiming that there has been some sort of nuclear attack on the country; if it is being made by some foreign terrorist or someone else is unclear. He states that she can't leave because the air is toxic and won't be clean enough to survive outside of the fallout shelter they are taking refuge in for at least a year. Along with Goodman is another young man, John Gallagher Jr., who tries to help Winstead through trying to come to terms on being in the shelter. From there the viewer is never sure what is actually happening behind Goodman's curtain; whether he's telling the truth, and if he is, does it mean she's actually safe with these two men?<br/><br/>The rest of the film is something I refuse to spoil because it is one hell of a ride. This is a very tense, thrilling and gripping story about three people locked down in a fallout shelter together just trying to get by. For the most part anyhow. The performances and chemistry between the actors are great. John Goodman gives a performance that is simultaneously chilling and likable. For the most part, he comes across as a guy that only wants to help, but there is always something about him that comes across as ""not right"". But it's played so well and written so perfectly that you don't know if there's legitimately something wrong with this character that could be life threatening or because he's just a socially awkward, conspiracy theorist with a sad past. You never truly know...well, until you know and then things are pretty clear. The film plays with you a little because you never feel like there is a trustworthy character. At any time, while yes they seem normal mostly but you don't know enough about them to be totally sure if they aren't up to something as well. All three characters are easily likable, even with Goodman being as intense and scary as he can be he also feels human and has moments of levity.<br/><br/>Once the ending happens, things feel crazy and I never knew where it was going once the third act hits. It is a fantastic watch and I highly recommend checking it out. If you like a thriller that will hold you in your seat while you need to use the restroom so bad, but you can't get up because of the need to see what happens next...here you go."
"cloud_nine","8","2","4","11 March 2016"," Keeps You Guessing Until the End
","This is a very well made (and inexpensive) movie for this genre. As you know by now, a young woman wakes up in a bomb shelter and seems to be kept prisoner by John Goodman along with a young man there of his own free will. Is Goodman's character crazy or not? Well, yes. And no. We hear he has a theory on mutant worms from outer space.<br/><br/>Things happen to both prove and disprove whatever you expect. This takes up about and hour and twenty minutes of the movie. Once Michelle, the woman, escapes, the plot takes a turn I never expected but enjoyed seeing. This is where the Cloverfield reference comes in.<br/><br/>During this final chapter there is a short sequence shot with a shaky hand held camera. Luckily it lasts only a few seconds.<br/><br/>As I moved into the lobby, couples were discussing the movie, what this and that meant. The ending was pretty straightforward really, if a bit short.<br/><br/>If you like the trailer, you'll enjoy the movie. Great orchestral soundtrack. One final thing: once the credits start, the movie is over. There is no final five second scene following the credits."

After much consideration you might take the chance with the latter threat, after you realise just how intense a game of charades can be.<br/><br/>""10 CLOVERFIELD LANE"" is a confined and agonising character driven thriller that cleverly feeds off the uncertainty of the situation and the interplay of its characters. Working in its favour is how they filmed it, like you're actually riding it out in the bunker alongside those inside. Feeling every sense of emotions streaming from the trio. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr really do hold you there with very good performances. Both their characters are adapt and affably brought across. But you just can't go passed the powerhouse acting of John Goodman. It's a tailored performance of pure manipulation and embodying unease. As for the last 10 minutes, it was serviceable but disappointing compared to the impressive build-up that had gone before it."
"AlihasanAgha","8","0","0","25 June 2020"," Like Icarus, They Flew Too Close To The Sun
","Im simply going to start with, wow. 10 Cloverfield Lane was beautiful.
This is a movie which at base evokes raw emotion. The senses of betrayal, anxiety, helplessness, loss, grief and of-course the gnawing feeling of suffocation and claustrophobia forces the audience to sweat throughout the movie. Which i find amazing, being able to play the audience the way the movie did. The focus through was building atmosphere and creating ambiguity. The viewers take the first portion trying to make sense of what is happening and when they believe they have figured everything out, the rug is swept from under in one smooth motion, leaving the viewer again struggling to understand what is true and what is not. The entire runtime kept the audience on the edge of their seats, from one strange turn to another.
Director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job creating a tense environment where every moment is one to be wary of. Not without giving credit to the incredible screenplay writers and of course the brilliant cast, John Goodman (Howard) , Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) and John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett). All of who bring an irreplaceable role to the movie, which actually earned each of them awards. The characters each are built and developed beautifully, with the continued air of ambiguity. This makes a death scene truly impactful, which is rare. Imagery, intricately detailed sets and props aid the film greatly, from well placed blood smears to single screws being misplaced, which in turn make the characters seem all the more real. These characters become so well developed that the audience feels true emotion for them, invested in them.
I believe however, the true pulling point for 10 Cloverfield Lane, would be the complete circumstantial ambiguity, the sheer uncertainty of the truth, blatantly baring the power of informational clarity.
Unfortunately this movie which is built underground did not really have a place for the sci-fi, Cloverfield content. Which felt unnecessary at the end of the film, trying to achieve too much. Despite being unnecessary it was still well done, yet it was too much. The movie came off as too ambitious, soaring too close to the sun, seeming to try doing everything because the entire vibe and pace of what appeared to be an absolutely gorgeous experience.
It actually was brought into the Cloverfield franchise without reason, Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken scripted it as an ""ultra low budget"" movie with an orignial title, The Cellar. However the franchise did indeed grant a 15million USD budget which allowed it to be the masterpiece it is today.
However the last ten minutes were not enough to daunt 10 Cloverfield Lane, as it went ahead winning fifteen various awards, including various for best screenplay, and being nominated for forty six other awards."

And it is a superior movie; I would make it an 8/10 if it weren't for the ending, which if not bad per se is definitely not on par with the rest of the movie.

But the entire ending sequence is just not needed and just doesn't fit with the tone of the entire rest of the film. Feel as though they just lobbed the ending in just for the sake of it. If this was just simply a thriller movie it would have worked so so well!<br/><br/>Acting is really good though, the plot was great (not the end) and the suspense kept throughout was done really well.

Two-thirds of this movie is a character study with very little action but well done if you like that sort of thing, which I do.

","10 Cloverfield is a thriller about a woman who wakes up in an underground bunker, after a car crash, and is told by a man that the world is under attack, and she must stay with him. This film is a good thriller, simple as that. Not amazing, outstanding, or brillant, but very good. This film is filled with slights twists and turns in narrative and whom you are supposed to believe, but at the end the audience is hit with a huge twist. Some people may find this twist to ruin the movie, but I think the film's quality was heightened by it. Without the twist, the film would have been left at a more cookie cutter and generic level. Sure its bizzare, but it makes you question what just happend. With only three reoccurring characters in the film, two of them give standout performances. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was solid, and John Goodman was brillant as the prepared, ordered, yet psychotic man.

","I was conflicted as to whether to categorize this film as a psychological horror-thriller or a monster flick (probably more to the former). The film was very much hyped back then (partly due to the viral marketing strategy employed); a long-awaited sequel to its critically-lauded predecessor, <a href=""/title/tt1060277/"">Cloverfield (2008)</a>. Instead, we got a remarkable quasi-sequel.<br/><br/>WHAT I LIKE: The atmosphere of the film was so intense and suspenseful; it doesn't really have any dull moments. There were twists at every turn; when you think you know it all, you actually don't. It kept you guessing right till the very end; is there really a catastrophic gas attack on the American soil? Or are they just kidnapped by a deranged old man? Or maybe there is more to it than meets the eye.<br/><br/>WHAT I DISLIKE: I was geared up for an all-out monster flick, but I was bombarded with a gripping survivalist tale.

","Re-watching the drama in a bunker that is ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is easier to relate to nowadays amid pandemic-related shelter-in-place orders. In a way, it's an amusing diversion to a fictional post-apocalyptic world. Part solid, claustrophobic drama concerning the dynamics of a triumvirate relationship underground--the rest of the picture remains effective, too, if you're willing to roll with the diverting contrivances. I don't especially care about the Cloverfield franchise, although the marketing of the movies has been innovative. This installment, in particular, was shoehorned ex post facto the subterranean-shelter script. Regardless, it rather fits in the sense that things are crazy in the movie from the get-go: from the abduction/rescue of a woman, that what at first seem to be a rape horror flick turns into a conspiracy-theory being validated by Armageddon and back into a sort of rape-threat plot, and that instead of the nut relishing his validation, he's mostly bothered by what little of humanity continues to surround him and exerts his energy on establishing his dominance over them. And that's just the stuff that happens before the bonkers finale.<br/><br/>None of this would work, either, without some decent acting. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is especially enjoyable when in the fighting spirit. It's John Goodman, however, who steals the show. His character is a more horrifying monster than any CGI alien or spacecraft covered by dark and obscure angles and framed by an artificial shaky camera. It's the deeply-rooted human interaction that's terrifying and thrilling--not, frivolous fun though it may be, that franchise-building surface nonsense."

","A great horror mystery thriller from a great debut in Dan Trachtenberg and great performance from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. but the most surprising and terrifying thing in this flick is the one and only John Goodman because he was amazing."
"Only_Honest_Review","8","0","0","16 March 2020"," Awesome twisty mystery thriller
","This is one of the best single location mystery thrillers and the best in the Cloverfield series. John Goodman plays the part of the creepy madman who keeps the viewers wondering is he deranged or is he telling the truth about an alien invasion. Excellent setup and buildup of suspense and mystery. I could not predict where the story was going or how it would end. This is what makes a compelling mystery SciFi movie that keeps you guessing and holds your attention all the way.<br/><br/>Some viewers didn't like the twist ending so rated it poorly because of it but I loved it. I think it's great that the story keeps you guessing and truth be told life itself is weird and just when you think it can't get any weirder it does. I can certainly relate to that so that's why I enjoyed it even more.<br/><br/>Btw I did not enjoy the first Cloverfield and could not even finish watching it with the annoying shaky cam and low production quality. This sequel is the best IMO. The third Cloverfield Paradox is also not bad and an enjoyable watch but just a notch below in suspense and story."

"meagainstthemovies","9","0","0","30 January 2020"," Seriously Underrated
","Perfect blend of psychological thriller and sci-fi. It's so hard to tell what is reality and what is just crazy talk. You can't tell if you are watching a hostage situation, an apocalyptic epidemic... or both. John Goodman's character is a great mix of creepy, mentality unstable, caring, and scientifically smart. The acting is fantastic from Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She is an underrated actress. She is a smart-strong woman who is having a hard time believing the reality of the world outside the crazy-filled bunker. I love how
it ties the first Cloverfield into it by making this movie just a situation that is happening while the first one is happening. It's like they created this Cloverfield universe that blends nicely without being too in your face with a series. Side note ""Cloverfield Paradox"" is almost unwatchable and I am happy to warn you the clever Cloverfield universe ends with this one (as of now). If they make something similar to the thrill of this one, it would definitely be worth a watch. If you like psychological thrillers that focus on a small group of people, then you'll like the sci-fi twists thrown at your mind through this one."

","A woman survives a near fatal car accident, and recovers to find herself in unfamiliar territory. It almost looks and feels like shes in a prison cell, she's even served trays of food in the same manner. Not knowing what's going on, she quickly turns on her kidnappers, but the attack is intercepted, and she is strongly cautioned NOT to do that again. Her kidnappers seem to understand that she's scared, and that she's still coming to her senses, but they soon set her straight: She's no longer on the Earths surface. They tell her that she's so many feet under the ground, and that she is safe, that the world is no longer safe for human existence. The story seems believable, but can her kidnappers be trusted? What's their true motives, their REAL intentions here? Eventually, they allow her out of the prison like cell, and bring her into more comforting enviroment. She's allowed to watch anything on the DVD player, etc...and from here, the film sends us mixed signals on what I would call....forced trust. She has no choice but to trust these people? The alternative is escape, but what if they are telling the truth about what's going on on the Earths surface? if they're lying, is this is a chance you can really take? The film sets a terrifying setting of absolute entrapment....and the viewer is left watching with an uneasy feeling that something just isn't right, but what the hell is wrong? John Goodman, as usual, plays an outstanding performance as one of the kidnappers, and his actions plays off to the viewer that his portrayal can go either way, you can easily see him as a friend just as much as you can see him being an enemy, but which is it? This mystery thriller is stylish, slick, and almost perfect in a lot of ways, but for reasons that I have to leave out so that I don't spoil the ending, I am giving this 6 stars. This film was on the right track to being AWESOME, and had the writers or filmmakers had given it just a little bit more thought, this could have been a perfect film for what it stands, however, I was a bit letdown with the ending. I'm okay with the way it ended, don't get me wrong, but had there been a little more thought, there was a more creative way that this could have all been played out for the final ending. For the most part, this is an 8 star film, but I'm demolishing it down to 6 for reasons that I cannot say, I cannot speak, I cannot spoil anything for you. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the tense mystery. See if you can figure it out."

Will she witness any proof of an attack and feel safe inside or will she keep trying to escape from the compound?

The first 2008 movie simply called ""Cloverfield"" is nothing like the 2016 sequel we review today. These movies surprise and entertain in a way unlike almost any other sci-fi/Horror movie. Today the 2nd Cloverfield movie ""10 Cloverfield lane"", takes centre stage.<br/><br/>Storyline<br/><br/>The storyline is too simple. Yes it details backstories, includes characters well, and surprises with deceit and changing character viewpoints. For me though, it feels slow in the middle and the ending lets it down. The setting is clearly restrictive, which doesn't help it's limited mid-section action.<br/><br/>Genre<br/><br/>The surprisingly reliable ""Wikipedia"" defines 10 Cloverfield lane as a ""Psychological horror ... with science fiction elements"". This 2016 release I'd define as simply a Thriller/Sci-fi. Thriller, since it tricks the mind, and Sci-fi because of it's dystopian setting.
Whilst it isn't what you'd expect from a standard horror movie, it has a slightly dark theme. Still not really a horror though ...<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>The characters are very well played, and they need to be. The one-dimensional setting throughout, means good acting is essential here. In this way, the film doesn't disappoint. With few characters, the diversity is very effective here and helps with the psychological elements.
The characters and behaviour, with heart-felt emotion, are difficult to fault, and keep surprising you.<br/><br/>Music<br/><br/>The music is used effectively to build tension, yet isn't overused. Types include ""Epic high suspense"" tracks, and ""Calming everyday tracks"". Silence is used on multiple occasion, with good effectiveness. Additional sound effects throughout, may have increased tension at times, but on the whole, music fits the plot well.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>Keeps you questioning character values.

And although it was short, I can honestly say that the ending was still unexpected and was probably made like that deliberately, so as to set the stage for a sequel.<br/><br/>The movie is a perfect example of how quality acting, storytelling and execution from the cast & crew will always beat fancy gimmicks."

Funny thing about this movie is that it works best if you have not seen and do not know the first movie, even if you know how to put yourself in the shoes of those who do not know and the end is suppressing, production set in not to say that it was a cloverfield film for the actors during the shootings, which made them more unimportant in the movie and what could happen.<br/><br/>Errors:<br/><br/><ul><li>The guy is not so flexible and is slow, and gave many opportunities to kill him, I know he is big and imposing and has a weapon, but he had a chance of doing something and will not do anything.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>She knows that howard hit her car and brought her to the bunker and arrested her in that room, and yet she accepted those excuses?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I waited for the whole movie to say, ""I do not care if it's out there like this or not I just want to get out of here, I do not care if I'm going to die or not"" this situation that should have happened at the beginning of the movie and did not happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The moment of the woman at the door does not make sense to me, Why does not the woman simply say that she is seeing an alien invasion and opening it up that they are coming after her? and it's only you to look at the background of what Michelle knew, and where she was that you know she should open the door and get out.</li></ul><br/><br/>Questions That Were Left Open :<br/><br/><ul><li>Michelle's leg recovers, but Emmett's arm does not?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the aliens did not invade the bunker or all the farm places why? being that they have advanced technology, they do not have any kind of technology or a way to know that there are people in the bunker?</li></ul><br/><br/>Problems in the movie as cloverfield franchise:<br/><br/><ul><li>The end of the movie is very bad for me as clovefield franchise, in this final part of the movie you can see that there is an advanced alien race attacking the earth, and that the clovefield as a weapon, which is a concept that destroys The first movie for me, the cover of the first movie says ""something found us"" and this is super good to think of and you go and know that it is just some technologically advanced aliens that ""found"" us and attack? I thought the clovefield is an intelligent alien by itself and that somehow came here and started to colonize and destroy everything,</li></ul>and not that he was controlled or commanded or something, and I think it should have more aliens because I think it's cool and I think it's great to have it in the end, but that they were monsters and inferior to the clovefield, same ones of the first film are that bigger, but because they use advanced technology demonstrates that others ah above it, the clovefield is a mysterious creature that appeared on the earth, so he wanted it to continue this style leaving him emperor as an alien monster.<br/><br/><ul><li>The part of the radio inside the car at the end of the movie is SERIOUS? WE ARE WINNING ? HOW? one of the BEST things for me in the clovefield movie is how the movie makes it clear that everything is over, there is no way to prevent such an attack and everyone will die, he shows this all the time in the movie, with the absurd reproduction he has with his cubs as they infect humans easily, and the end is perfect because they throw a nuclear bomb in the clovefield and it survives and continues, nothing can stop it is the destruction, something that came to take everything and in the 10 clovefield lane shows that the most aliens attacking the earth. Humans magically winning the technologically more advanced and intelligent aliens who planned the whole attack, I found it funny how the term ""found footaged"" did not fit clovefield's first movie, because there was no one to have found that recording because everybody died and we were just watching what they recorded, because I think it's bad that you know that the whole ""found footaged"" someone think the recording after or most of them, but they and Clovefield have to be like that too, the ""10 clovefield lane"" and MAINLY the trash of Paradox destroyed the first movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Note 8/10, In his first movie Dan Trachtenberg ja debut very well, after doing this with the fantastic short of Portal that is a game that I love, he comes and directs a follow-up to a movie that I love, and does it very well together with good acting performances, everything in this movie is fantastic and it creates a climax of tension and mystery all the time, a sequence worthy of his first movie, is worth watching."

","The first thing we see is the main character Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) supposedly running of from her boyfriend, when suddenly she ends up in a car crash. The crash itself seemed unnatural, and for some reason they decided to have the title flash in the middle of it, twice. It didn't start off on the right foot. But after that it seemed to find leverage.<br/><br/>One thing we see is a resemblance to the first Saw movie, only one room and the main character chained up. It has promise. At first, the scenes seem much too extended and that didn't contain any excitement. But this changed the further we went into it. The lines and delivery are just about enough to keep the scenes interesting, but the main thing that brings turmoil is the content of what they're saying. The story in this movie is a unique one indeed.<br/><br/>When a movie is made, solely focused on one room, you need dramatic things to happen, in a good way. This movie does just that. The story keeps unraveling as we go on, and turns out to be more and more breathtaking the deeper we go. The balance between action and calmness is also great, where there isn't more gore and activity than necessary. It is also the little things that builds up the different happenings, making for an aggressive expansion that thrills the viewer with excitement.<br/><br/>The conclusion is set to be a big and horrifying twist to the tale, that would have been a perfect ending to a otherwise brilliant movie. Instead they ruined it. The ending seemed rushed and unscripted, like they ran out of time and just threw something in. It was just plain weird and turned this great film into a cheap action movie.<br/><br/>Characterwise, they were not that interesting. Except for Goodman's Howard. Mystery surrounds him, is he telling the truth, or is he serial killer performing his frequent ritual? Well, for all the engaging depth of the character, it ended up ruined, all by the ending. It took away all the things during the movie that built up his intriguing character. However, Goodman's performance is not to be overshadowed here. He is surprisingly great as psycopath serial killer/crazy conspiracy theorist, deliviring a fenomenal performance. His acting is superior to the rest of the small cast, and he is truly over qualified for this movie, though he brings a very important piece to it.
In my opinion, Goodman is one of the most underrated actors of our generation, and deserves more praise.<br/><br/>When it comes together, as The Beatles sang, this movie is filled with thrilling events in a horrifying story, but is totally ruined by the ending. It was a bigger anti-climax than biting into a juicy red apple only to find out it was made of plastic. Shame."

The ties to the previous film are thin at best, but it's so good as a standalone film that, when it did reference the first, it didn't take me out of the film. Truly great film."
"litasnum1","7","0","0","21 February 2019"," A Great Film, Turned Just Good by a Crappy Ending
","There's enough there to earn ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" 7 stars; for me, that means I liked it. There's no plot. None. And that's fine. It's a character driven story where the viewer gets to decide what to make of each of the characters. Whatever you decide will dictate how you view this movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic; relatable, convincing as Michelle. John Goodman's Howard is as mysterious and eerie as they come, yet to a degree sympathetic at times, adding to the dynamics of the characters and the film as a whole. Emmett perfectly rounds out the trio as viewers tow - the - line trying to figure out whose side he's on. Of course, with ""Cloverfield"" in the title, aliens are to be expected. The low - budget, limited effects from the beginning are tossed out in the last roughly 20 minutes or so when we're finally introduced to the terror we (or at least I) was sure Howard was making up - cheesy aliens with even cornier effects. The aliens reminded me of the things from Stephen King's ""The Mist"" movie adaptation and add nothing to the story. Naturally, Michelle is able to fight them off and, we assume, becomes a true badass by heading off to Houston to help in what will be a probable sequel. Am I likely to watch should it come to fruition? Sure, but not with the overwhelming enthusiasm I would have for another suspenseful, character driven, realistic fright."

","At first glance, I probably would not have taken the time to watch this movie; I am not the type that cares what actresses/actors are in a movie, and the title was somewhat deceptive...since anyone who has seen the movie Cloverfield and didn't really care for the nauseating video camera effects, might think that it is related to that movie.
I watched the trailer and it still didn't produce any wow factor, but I decided to watch it anyway. At first the movie starts a little on the slow side and but it quickly gets interesting. Character development is lacking, but what information is given; actually is the perfect amount for this type of movie.
I think one of the best ways to describe the movie, with giving too much information; is that if you liked the movie 'Misery', you will enjoy this movie...there are several similarities between the two movies. Main character held against their will, what appears at first to be a psychotic captor - who in reality is extremely intelligent, suspense from not knowing what will happen next; overall I definitely think that it worth watching."

"nitzanhavoc","8","0","0","4 July 2018"," 6 for a good film, 10 for John Goodman's exquisite acting!
","In my opinion, a truly great film that is also part of an anthology and cinematic universe is one that can also function independently, so viewers who have never watched previous titles of the anthology (or are indeed ignorant to its existence) can still enjoy a rewarding experience. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a shining example of such a film, as its connection to the ""Cloververse"" is only made apparent in the final 10-12 minutes.<br/><br/>The story is good, though not great in my opinion. Michelle, a young women, goes through a car accident and wakes up to find herself fully medically treated for her injury, but handcuffed to her bed. Enter John Goodman (Howard), the absolute best part of the entire film, playing a role so completely removed from his regular typecast that it feels like rediscovering him for the profound actor that he is. Seen him in Roseanne or The Flintstones movie? Forget it. Or bettet yet - don't! It would only make you marvel all the more at his terrifying character and the absolute amazing acting on his part. <br/><br/>Goodman's character turns out to be Michelle's captor, but insists that he had saved her life from ""an attack"" that has made earth's environment uninhabitable. Goodman perfectly and exquisitely acts the part of a neurotic, disturbing and troubled navy veteran ""with a black belt in conspiracy theories"". Accordingly, he has slaved for years constructing a doomsday bunker with all the comforts of home.<br/><br/>Has Michelle been kidnapped or saved? Is Howard a kindhearted savior or a deranged delusional homicidal lunatic? What indeed happened outside the bunker? All of these questioned are gradually answered as the viewer is tormented along with Michelle by not being able to know for a fact what is true and what is assumed. The ultimate conclusion could be guessed in advance by followers of the Cloverfield franchise, but others might find the ending quite surprising.<br/><br/>All in all, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a chilling and thrilling experience of confusion, misinformation and terror. The absolutely wonderful acting by Goodman (and sufficiently good by rest of cast), the discomforting atmosphere and the suspenseful process of connecting the dots has left me personally on edge, terrified at times and applauding Goodman's acting. Honestly, I believe that even if some of you would find the film to be mediocre at best - Goodman's portray of a neurotic disturbed pseudo-antagonist would be enough to make the experience rewarding."

","I seriously enjoyed this movie. It combines mystery, thriller, and sci-fi all together in this blend of movie genres that is perfect. I didn't know what to expect going into the movie and how sci-fi it would be but honestly I was astonished at how much I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance is spectacular and John Goodman's acting was bone-chillingly creepy. He portrayed Howard's bordering paranoia and maniacal mind in such a way that it truly makes him unpredictable. <br/><br/>Another thing that I greatly enjoyed was the cinematography. The sepia tones sprinkled all throughout the film gave the trickling feeling of how Michelle began to become comfortable briefly just to have that shattered and the shots become dark and grey. <br/><br/>Next, is the score, I believe it was done by Bear McCreary and what a great job he did! All throughout the film you could really gain the sense of emotion or tension from the score and that is exactly what you should what from the soundtrack. A particular piece I liked was the track that played when Michelle was walking up the stairs for the first time to see the pigs and the growing anxiousness and temptation that lies in that door. <br/><br/>One thing that shocked me was the ending. It was un-pre-dictable! And that's what I love about a film. I did not know what was going to happen to Michelle and how she would escape the new antagonist that appears or if she would for that matter. I also loved the open ending and that after her ordeal she had become hardened and ready to fight for others. I would love a sequel!"

The movie had some unpredictable shocks that was pretty good but left some plot holes like why Emmett told the truth to Howard even though they could invent any other reason like that they were trying to make a costume as Michelle wanted to be a costume designer. Also some questions Howard's daughter that we didn't know what happened to her or why she wrote ""help"" or did he really killed her or why we mentioned the movie mentioned it in the first place and giving wrong picture to Michelle as that Howard was trying to make them really afraid of him thinking that he lied though he could not mention it in the first place. The place where they were hiding was pretty good with most of it's scenes and a good effort was done in it. The ending scene was like a superhero that I feel was a big flop with a shy shot of a monster. Overall I don't feel you should watch but it's worth a shot that I don't much recommend .

I'm one of those people who has to see the beginning! However, with this one, it wouldn't have mattered much.<br/><br/>The casting was good, but could still have been better!

A woman wakes up in a bunker and is told by Howard (Goodman), who is a stranger at the time, that the air is polluted and, because of that, nobody else survived, therefore there's no-one looking for her. She is introduced to Emmett and the audience wonders whether or not he's Howard's accomplice. Howard passes Michelle some clothes claiming that it was another girl's clothes, but admits that they're his daughters, who used to love to design, as does Michelle, but her mother turned her against him and took her to Chicago. Michelle finds a picture of the former 'housemate' who is ""no longer with us"" and questions whether it really is Howard's daughter, or another woman who went missing and was never heard from again. Is Howard just bonkers?<br/><br/>It was boring at the beginning, but picked up during the middle. It just lost me by the end, though, as it went from a murder mystery to a... sci-fi. Michelle then goes to combat with no prior combative experience, just because she heard someone's pleas over the radio. What a ridiculous decision!<br/><br/>The writers and director clearly didn't have a clear vision for the movie and couldn't iron out the plot holes, or even tie them up in a neat bow! <br/><br/>Would I re-watch or even recommend this movie to anybody?

","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is a tense and enjoyable addition to the Cloverfield franchise. While this film may be set in the same world as the original Cloverfield and contain a few references to the events of the first film, it is ultimately its own movie. Everything from the characters to directing style - even the genre - is different. This was frustrating to a certain extent, as I had the expectation for it to be a follow up to events of the first film, but once you get used to the fact that this is a completely different story to the original film, you are able to enjoy the film for what it is. Having only a small number of cast members (four to be exact), the pressure is put on the actors to pull off a good job, as all the attention is on them. Thankfully, all the three main actors did a superb job in their characters, with John Goodman being the clear standout. He portrays his complex character so well, and until the final moments of the film, you are still trying to figure out whether he is a hero or a villain which I found rather refreshing. The storyline was quite intriguing and in-depth with many surprising plot twists that kept me on the edge-of-my-seat, just like the original film. The ending did seem quite out-of-place when compared to the rest of the narrative, but when looking at the film franchise as a whole, it makes sense and certainly sets us up for another addition the Cloverfield franchise (which is coming out in 2018)!"

","I'm going to be judging this film as a standalone movie, not as a ""Cloverfield"" movie.<br/><br/>A movie with this contained environment and small cast of characters really has to have good performances for it to be able to work. And it does. John Goodman gives a delightfully off-kilter performance that constantly makes me second-guess whether or not his character means the others harm. Mary Elizabeth-Winstead also gives a good performance as a girl in Goodman's bunker. But like other movie heroines, she's not a complete idiot. Her character is one smart cookie, which is relief to see in a movie like this.<br/><br/>I also want to mention how good of a directorial debut that this is. Dan Trachtenberg previously directed the short film ""Portal: No Escape"", which I highly recommend (you can find it on YouTube). This film is very claustrophobic and masterful for this feature film debut.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this film is its placement in the ""Cloverfield"" series. I really don't see how exactly this is a ""Cloverfield"" movie.

","A difficult film to rate, on the basis that 10 Cloverfield Lane is an entertaining and gripping watch, however, it is also an amazingly irritating rehash of sorts, of 2008's Cloverfield, that ends up elongating the already unanswered questions of its predecessor, while creating a mountain heap more.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane unfortunately feels like a middle finger to fans and viewers. Two films in, and this series/franchise has literally said nothing about anything. The first time it was brilliant really, however with this film, it's extremely annoying, though still enjoyable. Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane's type of approach and mystery is VERY, VERY, VERY, reminiscent of Lost.<br/><br/>At this point, given the angle this franchise is taking, it can keep going indefinitely, telling side stories that are around the main, and still unexplained, unanswered and unexplored story arc.<br/><br/>Winstead and Goodman are great, true, but this film doesn't say anything, move anywhere and it accomplishes even less than what Cloverfield did. What is going on? What are these creatures and where do they come from? Hell, even if Trachtenberg and Co. didn't want to answer those particular mysteries as yet, almost 10 years later, then; Who is Howard? Did he kill the girl in the photo? Why did he lie about that girl being Megan? What is Howard's agenda? That injured woman, what happened to her? Even Emmett doesn't feel like he was fully developed, to point where it feels difficult to accept his death.<br/><br/>Also, am I the only one confused by the end part of this film? An end part by the way, that kind of falls apart just a little bit too, during all that puzzlement.<br/><br/>Thoroughly enjoyable movie, but, it says less, does less and accomplishes less, while creating more, and more, and more questions, that may never really be addressed, as there may be no reason to.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane has positioned itself as a movie that is either pretty great, or annoyingly useless, depending on how its sequel will approach the story as a whole."

This past Saturday me and a group of friends got together to watch a movie we had always wanted to. We saw on Netflix that a sequel to 10 Cloverfield Lane had come out and thought that it must be pretty good if they came out with another one. <br/><br/>This 2016 movie, directed by Dan Trachtenberg, was a suspense/horror film stationed just around the time of the apocalypse. The main protagonist, a woman named Michelle, is in a car accident and wakes up to find herself chained to a wall in a nuclear bunker. The events that led up to and including all the different circumstances are slowly revealed throughout the movie. To many individuals, this may sound just like another horror movie where the main character makes obviously foolish mistakes that lead to this ultimate demise, but it could not be more different. Michelle thinks of every possible way to escape the grasp of her ""captors"" but soon learns the truth about her situation. As the movie progresses we learn more and more about the characters and what they are all about. <br/><br/>I found this movie entertaining, heart pumping, and thought provoking. I found it to be a satisfying mix between horror and suspense compared to some competitors. It was quite interesting to watch this woman and think, ""would I be able to think of something if I was in her position?"" The movie ended on a fairly large cliffhanger and I am looking forward to seeing the next in the series."

Then things get darker and the horror turns into terror as imagination of the viewer starts to run wild. The ending really messes with your expectations but in the end it works as you weren't hyped in the first place. It's not one of those films that was hyped to be great so you can't help but dread the thought that it might not, or worse it turns out to be the opposite.

He keeps her from leaving by emphasizing that the world is no longer habitable following an attack on the planet.<br/><br/>This is the second movie of the Cloverfield franchise and Dan Trachtenberg's big film debut, produced by the great J.J. Abrams.<br/><br/>I feel like Cloverfield is a very underrated film. A lot of people didn't even saw it and they still decided to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane. Truthfully, you can do that and your movie experience will not change at all. Even though it is, in fact, part of the franchise, I can only find one and one only connection to the first one. I will discuss this one detail after my rating since it has a major spoiler for Cloverfield and a minor spoiler for the one I am going to review now.<br/><br/>I love claustrophobic horror thrillers! I love when the film instantly makes me feel at the edge of my seat, ten minutes after it starts. Dan Trachtenberg's big movie debut does that for the entire runtime. The screenplay is especially intriguing and mysterious, which captivates me from the very start.<br/><br/>The mystery surrounding the state of the planet and Howard's mental condition is so well manipulated, raising the tension and the suspense levels extremely present. There is always something new, there is not one misplaced scene (as we know, J.J. Abrams does not waste one single shot) and everything has its purpose whether that is a line of dialogue, an action or even just a shot of a bookshelf.<br/><br/>On such a confined space, it is unbelievable what a first-time film director can accomplish. He is able to provide new feelings and fresh scenes after one hour in the same freaking living room. I admire the camera angles and the extensive use of visual storytelling (once again, I bet JJ has his hands on this). The editing is seamless and the tone is very well-balanced. A practical setting elevates the realistic cinematography and the subtle score helps to increase the amount of suspense.<br/><br/>As for the cast, they are the real stars of the movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has her career-best performance. She is incredibly compelling and everything she does, she does it flawlessly. Her character is a remarkably unconventional one, having in mind the cliche dumb characters in films like this. They always do what they are not supposed to and the audience is always ahead of them.<br/><br/>Not Michelle. She is extremely smart and she is way ahead of the viewers! There are so many twists and turns due to her craftiness and intelligence during tense circumstances. Her backstory contradicts her behavior once she is in that bunker, which proves how much the character had to change in order to overcome her situation.<br/><br/>However, John Goodman might be the absolute standout. He is just perfect. He needs to do something a lot of actors struggle with: insert doubt into the audience's minds. Howard is someone that I never know whether if he is crazy or if he is actually a rational guy. In a scene, he seems completely insane but right in the next one, he does or says something notably clever.<br/><br/>It is impossible to understand if he is telling the truth or if something is up. Undoubtedly, this is due to Goodman's terrific performance and also due to the brilliant script that he and everyone else received. John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett) is the third person living in the bunker and even though he is fairly well-developed, he is only there to serve the story (he is even connected to the moment that changes the course of it). Good display from Gallagher.<br/><br/>The first act is fantastic and the second act is phenomenal. The beginning of the third act is enthusiastic, but its ending is really abrupt. This is going to be a big issue for most people. If someone is not paying attention to everything that happens in the first two-thirds of the movie (every line of dialogue, every sound, every shot of an object), the ending is going to even make people hate this film because they will feel that it does not make sense.<br/><br/>To those people, I recommend you to stop and think about it. Think about the movie and remember everything that happened until the beginning of the third act. If you do this with no anger clouding your judgment, then you will surely understand what Trachtenberg and his team wanted to deliver. Nevertheless, it comes very quickly and I feel that the way they executed it, is asking too much of me to let pass some line-crossing stuff, even though it is a science fiction film.<br/><br/>Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a fantastic ""sequel"" (if I can call it that) to the movie that started it all. The entertainment levels are extremely high and I love the subtle connection to Cloverfield. Award-worthy performances from John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who carry a captivating and mysterious claustrophobic thriller. A wonderful debut of the director Dan Trachtenberg, who almost flawlessly tells a phenomenal story. The only stain in the picture is the abrupt ending and the way it is executed. The slow pacing helps to elevate the suspense and tension in a very unique film for its genre, while the technical aspects are to praise as well.<br/><br/>
****************** SPOILER WARNING ******************
As I said at the end of my Cloverfield review, there is an extremely easy-to-miss black dot falling from the sky into the ocean, in the last shot of the movie.<br/><br/>This is a satellite that for some reason fell from space. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, we learn through a couple of lines of dialogue and a shot of a bookshelf, that Howard's former job had to do with ... satellites. This is the only detail of this film that I can connect to the previous one."

","JJ Abrams. I don't really like him. He wrote I wanna say... the last two Star Wars movies? Yeah. Were they good? Not necessarily... they had many faults.<br/><br/>However, this movie delivered everything I expected from it. <br/><br/>So, if you haven't seen it, let me give you a quick summary:<br/><br/>A girl has woken up in the bomb shelter of a man that claims that the world has been attacked by something either chemical or nuclear, and the air is not breathable outside. Therefore, she must decide if he is a crazy psycho who is trying to kidnap her, or if he is telling the truth about the air outside, and it really isn't safe, and he is really trying to keep her safe. <br/><br/>And I do have to say, this movie impressed me. For JJ Abrams, at least. The ending was kind of garbage, though. (I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.) It wasn't... the best ending that they could have come up with. They should have given it more time, and they shouldn't have stuffed all of that stuff into the ending.<br/><br/>Also, the science in this movie was really on point. Like, the acid. It was really cool. (Well, except for the ending.)<br/><br/>Do not read any further if you don't want spoilers!!! I have decided to put some in here.<br/><br/>(Warning, again: Stop about 20-30 minutes before the actual ending, when she is first getting out of the shelter to avoid the ending. Just assume that she got out, the air is actually breathable, and she is going to Houston to kill some aliens for the army.)<br/><br/>So, 9/10 for being a good movie overall. Just avoid the ending... it needed more time to develop into something more."

","I don't know why I put off watching this film till now. It's great!<br/><br/>One of the best-paced and written thrillers I've seen. Although a lot of time is spent in an underground bunker, nothing feels slow or unnecessary. Also, does a good of job of including humor without boggind down the tension.<br/><br/>Camerawork and musical selections all complement the work. Both Elizabeth Mary Winstead and John Goodman are on their A-game, but it Goodman who steals the show with a nuanced character who can be both unnerving and sympatheric.<br/><br/>Dont' listen to those saying the ending is tacked on. The ending takes you completely by surprise and is a unique way to end a film like this."

","To begin with the movie holds you going, with a mystery so conveniently drawn that you have to keep watching. This kind of tensions-driven unclarity is the only interesting part of the first act. The second act tho! is soooo good that it hold the whole movie standing, and without the abusing undertone, this movie would have been a complete flop. Jumping ahead to the final act, which is... well... surprising. I must admit that I'm really not a fan of those type of endings, but it's still an enjoyable refreshment from the claws of clichÃ©-hollywood! 
It may sound like i didn't like this movie, but that's not the case! I just didn't like all of the decisions from the production. The actors are great! especially John Goodman, who is portraying this love-hate character in the perfect resemblance of.... oh! no spoilers ;)"
"CountJonnie","7","0","0","13 February 2018"," Very entertaining movie, on various levels
","10 Cloverfield Lane is not a sequel, but more a tie in, or a side story. Like the original it builds on claustrophobia and not really knowing.<br/><br/>A woman (Winstead) gets into an accident and wakes up in a cellar in the ground, owned by John Goodman. Goodman welcomes and helps her, but doesn't intent to let her go, because happenings outside that sound to crrazy to be true. This gives the feeling of a creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere, where that which is safe, feels dangerous. There the cat and mouse game begins, and Winstead is a prisoner hellbent on escaping, while trying to keep Goodmans thrust. The question is raised, will she be able to go, and if she does, what will she encounter?<br/><br/>The movie works as a horror movie and a thriller. Goodman is perfect as the crazy guy with good intentions. Winstead is strong as the empowered victim. Together they carry a movie where for a long time nothing happens, but with palpable tension. And although movies like Cloverfield Paradox will make you stop wanting to see more about Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane will make you ask for more."
"dfa120374","6","0","0","7 February 2018"," A Very Decent Cloverfield Spin-Off
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense thriller carried by great performances from John Goodman & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. This isn't really a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield though; more like a spin-off, with a different story taking place in a different part of the world. While Cloverfield jumped onto a current trend at that time (""found footage""), this film feels more old-fashioned in style.<br/><br/>Dan Trachtenberg's film is less visually engaging than it could have been, but this is solid entertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing before it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending. The sense of uneasiness you get at times is certainly there in the script, but it's Goodman's performance that makes your skin crawl. He captures a man on the edge of sanity for whom control is key. He's not an obvious maniac, but someone who honestly thinks he's a savior. Goodman keeps us guessing, allowing glimpses of the possibly kind man that Howard used to be.<br/><br/>In terms of performance, Winstead matches Goodman in every way. She helps carry carry 10 Cloverfield Lane, conveying Michelle's conflicted feelings about her predicament and staying completely in the moment that the tension remains.<br/><br/>The final 30 minutes of the movie is pretty much going to dominate conversation. Without spoiling anything, it's a series of events in which Michelle finds new challenges around every corner, and while I'm not sure it's as solid as it could have been, Winstead and the filmmakers keep it working through sheer confidence.<br/><br/>The visuals this time around aren't as overwhelming as they are in Cloverfield, but that can just reiterate the point that a film doesn't need to be laden with special effects to be any good. Investing in decent performances & story can be more key to making a film enjoyable than relying on amazing visuals.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield lane is definitely worth a watch and it's nice to take a break from the usual ""found footage"" Horror/Thrillers that seem to dominate at times."

","10 Cloverfield Lane follows a woman taken against her will to a safety shelter. There she's told the air outside is dangerous and she brought there for her own safety. She soon learns there is a monster inside, that frightens her much more then the threat of the outside world.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a surprising sequel that I doubt anyone saw coming. it doesn't rely on monster effects like the first Cloverfield did. Instead quarantines a few charcters and relies on their performances.<br/><br/>John Goodman was snubbed from the academy awards when he wasn't nominated for best supporting actor.
He is so intense it's amazing.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Both provide great performances too.<br/><br/>This film has a lot to offer, even if you weren't a fan of the first Cloverfield.
I can't recommend this one enough. It's a masterpiece."

","There was a slow beginning where I thought the fat guy was kind of weird. But after her attempt to escape, I started to think that he was normal. BUT then after that twist halfway through the movie, I was like what the F**K he's a weirdo again. But kudos to the lady for figuring out what's happening and actually using her knowledge to save herself. One thing I didn't like was the ending cause it was completely different from the rest of the plot. I read other reviews and they also thought the ending ruined the entire movie.

","I enjoy this movie more every time I watch it. <br/><br/>I love claustrophobic horror/thriller movies. This movie does that very well. It tells a great story and keeps you interested with only three characters in a very tight space. <br/><br/>The acting is all spot on, especially from MEW and Goodman. Goodman plays a creepy survivalist and does it well. MEW shows a great range of emotion and plays a very strong survivor. <br/><br/>I am not sure how much this movie actually connects to Cloverfield, but as a stand alone movie it is excellent. <br/><br/>The music is great in this movie also, it leads the mood and emotion of the film. Most movies these days don't have music that stands out at all..it is just there, that's it. The music here sticks with you and is creepy. <br/><br/>This is an underrated movie that you should definitely check out. Don't let the Cloverfield name fool you, it is a very different type of movie from Cloverfield."

","John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead star in this 2016 sci-fi-thriller.

"denis888","6","0","0","6 January 2018"," Sometimes Scary, Sometimes Very Slow
","I love the original 2008's Cloverfield as it is a strikingly powerful shaky camera horror-packed thriller with astounding tempo and impending doom looming over. This is a kind of sequel albeit a very distant and sometimes not at all, as much of the time this is a dense psychological thriller and not a monster attacj flick. 
What was right, was the casting of menacing John Goodman and awesome Mary Elizabeth Winstead as main parts. They do their job well, keeping this often achingly slow-pacing film somewaht feasible. 
What was wrong, was the pacing, the finalle and the whole lenghth - it could've done a way better were it shorter and faster. Thus, a good isea is somewhat marred and spoilt by a jarring slow tempo and some very wrong plot turns.
I hope the third part of Cloverfield saga would turn up better and ore consistent as this second suffers a lot from what was mentioned above."
"sergelamarche","8","0","0","2 January 2018"," Chills and frills that keeps us guessing
","Excellent acting and a story line that keeps us guessing about the true nature of the film. That fact was a little obvious after the second turn in the story, but it had more turns in store. Is this inspired by Silence of the lambs, zombies or The mist (S.King) all at once? It is less strange and more strange at the same time. It has lots of nice touches from horror classics (solubilizing victims, the Alien), to bits of lovely french references (which could be horror for the englishes). The story evolves and we are kept in the dark long enough to long for an answer, damn the consequences, like our heroine. Super good special effects with the aliens invadors. Flaws though: how can the generator be working so long; how can the air be so well filtered; how can she throw up so high; how can alcohol be right there when you need it. Details that don't distract too much from the action, humoristic at times. Excellent film!"

"jamesrupert2014","8","0","0","7 December 2017"," Odd but effective mix of genres
","Most of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a psychological thriller as a young women (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up in an underground shelter following a car accident, only to find that she is essentially a prisoner of an erratic and unbalanced survivalist (John Goodman). Goodman's character is her only source of information and the first act revolves around her assumption that he's lying when he tells her that the world outside the shelter has been destroyed and the air is unbreathable (despite claims of the shelters third occupant to have seen a flash in the sky before fighting his way into the shelter). Winstead is very good in the role of the desperate trapped women, who is both capable and resourceful and whose actions and behaviour, with in the context of the story, are realistic and compelling. Goodman's unbalanced survivalist is also very good, especially as his version of what has happened/is happening begins to unravel, and his guests/captives become first suspicious, then terrified. The film ends with the revelation of what has occurred beyond the walls of the shelter, linking the titular address with the kaiju film ""Cloverfield"" (albeit obliquely). All-in-all, an interesting and well-made apocalyptic thriller with an interesting twist on the 'unreliable narrator' and a somewhat unexpected ending that (based on reviews) viewers many find satisfying, intriguing, or preposterous."

"jake-hageman","10","0","0","25 October 2017"," A claustrophobic thriller that benefits from its small cast
","So when I first heard about this movie, I thought it looked stupid. Of course I didn't know much about this movie, but I still held rather low expectations for this movie. I thought initially ""okay she just has to figure why she's in the bunker that's not too exciting"". BOY WAS I WRONG. <br/><br/>This movie exceeded my expectations by a long shot. It kept me intrigued with an exhilarating story line. It developed really good characters based off of strong performances from all the actors, especially John Goodman. I'd argue that this is one of his best movies of all time. This movie also feels very claustrophobic. This movie made me feel like I was there with them in the bunker, figuring out why I was there. And I loved it. I always admire movies that are able to draw me into a world and keep me there until the credits roll. <br/><br/>The cinematography and writing for this movie are both phenomenal. The acting and directing is just incomprehensibly good. And the ending is very unexpected, but I found it very intriguing and fascinating. <br/><br/>One more thought. What I think is the best part about this movie is its ability to blend genres. This movie takes aspects of horror, thriller, suspense, mystery, sci-fi, drama, and even a couple comedic moments and makes a stunning movie. It's impossible to confine it to one genre since it fits so well amongst multiple genres. <br/><br/>I am very satisfied with what I was presented with with this movie. I highly recommend you check it out! If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch it free on Amazon Prime Video!"

","Spoilers Throughout!!!! You've been warned.<br/><br/>Here's how I envision the meeting: <br/><br/>""Guys, guys, listen, if you want J.J. to put his name on it, you need to cheapen your artistic tastes a bit. You need to tie it in to something science fiction, I don't know, like War of the Worlds.""<br/><br/>""But it's a really great story that has nothing to do with science fiction.""<br/><br/>""That's the problem. You know he's going to slap ""cloverfield"" in the title of the next thing he does, to let audiences know they can expect something great.""<br/><br/>""But this has nothing to do with giant monsters and crappy cinematography or gimmicks.""<br/><br/>""Well, if you want J.J. to sign off on it, you better make it tie in to science fiction. He's got an image to maintain.""<br/><br/>""What if we put a spaceship and an alien dog at the end?""<br/><br/>""Perfect! J.J.'ll love it.""<br/><br/>Can you tell I really don't care for J.J. Abrams' body of work? Somehow I can't help feeling that if he was an interior decorator, he'd specialize in bordellos and black velvet paintings. I like good science fiction, aliens, and the unknown when done well. 10 Clover, while being a good story and having science fiction, aliens, and the unknown, does everything right but the first two of those three things. Having said that, here's what I have to say about the actual movie.<br/><br/>Brief synopsis: Woman packs her things and leaves someone. Drives along at night and has a wreck. Wakens to find herself in a shelter with two men. Tension builds. Climax occurs. Heroine escapes. Aliens appear on screen. Heroine has that ""Give me a break"" moment. She defeats one alien while the other inexplicably leaves her alone. She runs off to join resistance. The lesson: Survivors of abuse have medical and military experience and can fight aliens.<br/><br/>You can trust what others said about the movie never dragging. It moves briskly along, and it carries the viewer well for the most part. Part of Abrams' influence, I think, is the need to keep moving to hold the audience's attention. That's about the best I can say for almost any story that J.J. puts his name on. This movie rises well above the rest however for a number of reasons:<br/><br/>Performances were decent, and John Goodman delivers one clearly among his best. <br/><br/>Every detail matters. If you're paying attention, like our protagonist, you'll see that one of the things the writers did well was to ensure that every word and detail mattered to the outcome of the story. If you missed that fact, go back and really pay attention to all the little details. I don't want to give them away, so no spoilers here.<br/><br/>Someone mentioned that the protagonist was a little too capable, but I'm not so sure. I think it works well. I think that the main difference is that the protagonist is engaged in her circumstances instead of remaining pedestrian and victim like so many others. What kept this from becoming a true horror movie is that she kept her wits and used what she knew to good effect.<br/><br/>Proof that you don't need tons of money or huge sets to tell a good story. I think this is one that students should study, not only for where it went right, but also for where it went wrong.<br/><br/>Kowtowing to Abrams' ego seems mostly restricted to the last few minutes of the movie--which, I might add, is the only part of the movie that drags. I don't remember seeing a single lens flare.<br/><br/>Now the bad:<br/><br/>The ending felt tacked on to me. Someone else blamed J.J., and I have to agree. It felt like J.J. blundering about. While I enjoyed the movie and the ending, to a degree, it didn't feel like it had the same meticulous carefulness that the rest of the scenes displayed. I think they went back and inserted the woman at the door afterward so that they could tie in to the outcome somewhat. It still feels tacked on."

","What if you were in a car accident, and your rescuer was a crazy doomsday prepper, and it's officially doomsday? Well, you get this, a tight, claustrophobic and altogether freaky dynamic between a makeshift family that surely features at least one creepy secret. Settings like these are rife for creating character tension, and that is done quite successfully. We get our nice lull, where it seems everything is going to be fine, until the secret is exposed and Michelle and Emmett make their choices to push through the third act.<br/><br/>All three primary cast members are terrific, and the tension between them is very real. John Goodman is especially outstanding with Howard's increasingly bizarre behavior, and insistence that he be treated a certain way. And the mystery surrounding what went on outside never quite abates, and is put up as something that we, the audience, must know at some point. The nuance weaves through the interactions between the characters, and we are left to wait for the other shoe to drop, and when it does, the conclusion is a fantastic payoff."

This movie takes you on an unsettling creepy journey to get answers for many questions in a smart young women's head wants to reach a logical resolution to what happened to her. you can touch the tension level increases gradually from the beginning of the film tell the end. The music score is insanely amazing. It hooks you once the movie starts. I really want to thank Bear McCreary for this score. No one can deny the amazing performance of John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I can't wait to see the next project of the ambitious director, Dan Trachtenberg who has a directing talent should be invested well in the future. 10 Cloverfield Lane is definitely worth seeing.

","This is a film where the director has an iron-grip on the ""feel"" that he wants each and every scene to exude. Everything from what each character says, how they say it, the little mannerisms they have, the sound, the music--EVERYTHING works together to convey the emotions and view-point of the film's protagonist. Even when you already know what's going to happen, the film still manages to instill the sense of suspicion and unease that our heroine experiences. <br/><br/>Of course, while the director gets plenty of kudos for allowing the film to accomplish, the other shining star of the show is Goodman, who absolutely slays it.

"AlsExGal","6","0","0","9 July 2017"," Less action than in the first film in this belated sequel
","Belated pseudo-sequel to the divisive 2008 movie Cloverfield. That first film dealt with an unexplained giant monster attack in NYC, and was shot in the ""found footage"" style: everything shot with a video camera, as if by one of the characters within the film, with all the shakiness and amateurishness one would expect. The idea is to lend the film added verisimilitude and place the viewer within the narrative. This works only occasionally, and in my opinion Cloverfield was one time that it did. However, that being said, this sequel does away with that narrative device, and is shot in a traditional, stationary manner, with known actors and professional cinematography.<br/><br/>The story follows Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman in an unhappy relationship who packs her bags and hits the road, leaving her boyfriend and driving toward parts unknown. She suffers a terrible car accident, and when she awakens, she's chained up in the underground bomb shelter of the distinctly odd Howard (John Goodman), a conspiracy theorist and survival nut who claims that while Michelle was unconscious, the world up above has come to an end. What caused it, he isn't sure (Russian nukes? Terrorist bio-weapons? Alien invaders?), but he knows it isn't safe to step outside. Also in the shelter is goofy country boy Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), a former employee of Howard's in the construction of the shelter.<br/><br/>The vast majority of the movie is a slow-burn suspense drama, as Michelle tries to learn more about her surroundings, and the two roommates she's now forced to live with. You know Howard isn't all there, but just how far gone is he? Or are his most outlandish claims only the tip of the iceberg? These scenes are well-done for the most part, and the actors are all good, especially Goodman, who uses his bulk to great advantage. Winstead does great work as well, using her eyes more than anything to project her performance. The problems for me came in the relatively uninspired script. There wasn't really a beat in the film that I didn't see coming, and all of the characters ended up where I expected them to be within the first 10 minutes. The dialogue, too, while showing a tiny bit of wit here and there, didn't hold my attention as well as I hoped. I won't go into the film's last act, only to say that ""Cloverfield"" is in the title for a reason, but don't expect the giant monster action of the first film. Directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. From Paramount."
"avik-basu1889","7","0","0","21 June 2017"," Very well directed, but cheapened by clear corporate interference !!!
","What I liked:<br/><br/>1. The Direction - Based on this film, I have to say Dan Trachtenberg has an inherent sense of crafty visual storytelling that really impressed me. I always find a filmmaker's ability to express feelings and emotions and also proceed the narrative with visuals instead of dialogue, extremely remarkable. I found that flavour of Hitchcock- esque 'pure cinema' in '10 Cloverfield Lane'. The opening to this film is wordless and we don't get to hear a single word out of the protagonist Michelle's mouth till about the 9th or 10th minute mark, but the director manages to say a lot during that sequence with just the camera. Trachtenberg's use of camera movement is fluent and expressive(reminded me of the camera movements in 'Don't Breathe'), his ability to generate and raise the tension in specific scenes is uncanny and he also has the ability to get exceptional performances out of the actors.<br/><br/>2. The acting - We get marvellous performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. Winstead completely pulls off the task of portraying a character who goes through a spiritual and behavioral transformation over the course of the film and Goodman is exceptional as the wild card who remains a mystery throughout the film.<br/><br/>3. The script(for the most part) - The film's core concept, though not new or original, is still refreshing due to Trachtenberg's handling of the material. An undeniable claustrophobia, paranoia and dilemma is always lurking around the corner in every scene in '10 Cloverfield Lane'.<br/><br/>What I did not like:<br/><br/>THE LAST 15 MINUTES - '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a clear example of a film that can be divided into 2 parts - the part made by a filmmaker which is approximately the first 85 minutes and the part made by a studio committee which is approximately the last 15 minutes. In order to make a direct connection with the original 'Cloverfield' film which was merely tangential up to that point, the film takes a turn for the absurd and does exactly what it managed to avoid till then, which is become bloated and ridiculous in an attempt to emulate big budget, effects heavy, commercial studio films that the world gets inundated with. We get this laughably over the top action sequence which betrays the restraint that ornamented the rest of the film. The final sequence genuinely did put me off to some extent and came close to souring some of the goodwill of the film in my mind. The concept of Michelle outgrowing her fears and making a bold decision could have been executed in a much more subtle fashion which would've been appropriate for the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Although the finale is disgustingly plastic and hollow, I can't ignore Dan Trachtenberg's brilliant visual storytelling, tension building and crafty handling of the film and I also can't ignore the remarkable performances on show and it is these elements that make the film worth a recommendation."

","A few years ago, 'Cloverfield' was released. If you missed it, it was one of those 'found footage' films where everything is shot by the point of view of one really annoying character who won't put the camera down no matter how much danger comes their way. Sorry, I digress. I really don't like the 'found footage' genre. I find it cheap, annoying and just downright implausible. It was because of this that – despite 'Cloverfield' being a massive hit, I hated it. A giant Godzilla-like alien monster started rampaging through a major U.S. city and the story was about a small band of survivors fleeing the area. One of them had to film the hold experience because I don't know. I just remember getting really frustrated with the film because he wouldn't stop filming even when his leg was being eaten by little monsters. Anyway, it was because of that which meant I wasn't that bothered about seeing this sequel. Only it's not a sequel. Or is it? For a start it's not 'found footage' any more (hooray!) and we meet a girl who gets into a bad car accident on the way home. She's dragged from the wreckage by good ol' John Goodman who takes her home and they live happily ever after. Only joking. He's actually a paranoid nut-job who built a 'perfect' survival bunker just in case the world should happen to end and he wanted to go on living. So, our heroine wakes up there, injured and a little frightened. Especially as Mr Goodman won't let her leave. The closest she gets is the reinforced steel door where she can look out over the stricken world. Only it's not that stricken. It looks quite normal, but Goodman swears that there's enough fallout out there to nuke a cockroach from the inside out. So, she's trapped, with no idea what's happened. Can she get out? Should she, even if she could? Anyway, because most people have either seen, or are aware of, the first movie with the giant monster etc, we assume something bad has indeed happened to the rest of the world. Only this film doesn't really follow on from the original 'Cloverfield.' So, the longer it goes on, you wonder whether you're actually watching a sequel at all, or another film that has sort of piggybacked off its name/fame and has created something different all together. 'Cloverfield' was a big budget monster/horror movie whereas '10 Cloverfield Lane' is small, low budget and confined to the bunker for the whole time.<br/><br/>And, in my opinion, it's the superior movie by far. John Goodman is excellent as the paranoid nutter who is probably the last person you want to be stuck on Earth with and you're rooting for our heroine to escape (assuming there's a world left to escape to!). It's more psychological horror than giant-monsters-crushing-New-York-horror and it's all the better for it. I hear that some people weren't too keen on the ending, but, even if you hate it, you should hopefully enjoy the preceding 90% enough to just ignore the very last few scenes. I wouldn't watch Cloverfield again, but I'd definitely watch this in a few years time."
"chazthegamr","8","0","0","17 June 2017"," A surprisingly well developed and tense film.
","I initially had no interest in seeing this film, I never saw the original Cloverfield film, and I wouldn't want to waste my time on a generic sci-fi film. Therefore, I never saw this film in 2016.<br/><br/>A year later and I see this film pop-up in many Top 10 lists, and I decide to give this film a chance after I heard that the film was actually good and didn't follow the story of Cloverfield. I was immediately surprised by the certificate given to the film; I expected the film to be a 15. Therefore, I knew that this film would be tame.<br/><br/>However, immediately after watching this film I can safely say that 10 Cloverfield Lane is the most brutal and tense 12 rated film I've ever seen. Although most importantly, 10 Cloverfield Lane is the most well-made and tense film I've seen this year.<br/><br/>The films' quality is ensured from the well developed characters and style. The film always places the perspective on Michelle, this is conveyed through the use of tense atmosphere and delivery that perfectly reflects our main characters' emotions.<br/><br/>The most important factor that ensured the quality of this film, was the character development and story. Instead of shoving a narrative down your throat through exposition, the film instead decides to play out naturally as you progressively map out the story in your head.<br/><br/>The film always catches you off-guard, this is due to the character development, this benefits the audience as they route for the characters, as they're given a reason to care.<br/><br/>The film uses sound and visuals to emphasise an impression of a character, however the film constantly flips your expectations. At first the film presents Harold negatively through the viewers expectations, however we soon change our opinion due to his devotion to ensuring safety. As an audience member you're against Michelle, although if you apply the information you've learnt later in the film you'll realise that the expectations you had at the beginning were right all along.<br/><br/>There are unfortunately a few problems holding this film back from being an excellent film. Despite the developed nature of the film, unfortunately 10 Cloverfield Lane devolves into the typical sci-fi alien action seen in many films, however what makes this segment forgiving is the realistic and serious tone.<br/><br/>I'd also like to point out that this film was surprisingly tense and shocking, especially for a 12 rated film, you see a man being broken down in acid, and a mentally insane woman deteriorating. All of which I expected in a 15 rated film.<br/><br/>Another problem is some of the decisions made by the characters, while the characters are human, some of there actions are a bit unjustified. No-one would immediately breathe in the air without precautions, despite this for the most part all seemingly dumb decisions are all answered with a reasonable excuse. One example of this is that Michelle constantly demands reminders for information she already knows this is explained due to the head wound.<br/><br/>Other problems are from the standard movie-making clichés. The film has a lot of moments that are unlikely to occur in reality, although the film also has a cliché sequel bate ending. This annoys me deeply as the fact that a studio wants more money is very apparent.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is now one of my top favourites of 2016, and I'm glad I saw 10 Cloverfield Lane. 8/10"

"blumdeluxe","6","0","0","28 May 2017"," The ending ruined it for me
","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a movie that keeps you guessing from the very beginning until almost the end. It tells the story of a woman that wakes up in an unfamiliar room after a car accident and has to decide whether it was a kidnapping or a rescue that brought her into this situation.<br/><br/>In my eyes, the producers managed very skillfully to create an atmosphere in which you cannot tell, who to trust and what is the truth. Through several events, viewers get increasingly uncertain in what to think or even get lead on wrong paths. The small cast manages to interact with each other beautifully and thus gives some credibility to the almost bizarre scenario. Unfortunately, this is not how the movie was brought to an end. In my opinion, this could have been a very strong title, but then the aliens hit in. To tell it in advance, I really really really dislike when movies mix up reality and fiction. I don't have anything against neither, but when they intermingle, 99% of the time it doesn't work for me. As here. When I see how the lead character is chased by some alien creature, all of the tension that was built up during the plot just collapses. From that point on I'm more busy rolling my eyes than questioning what happens next. Maybe that's my own weakness but I really can't help the feeling.<br/><br/>Now this is a strong movie still, it has some creativity and is much fun during most of its playtime. If you can cope with some fiction, you'll have a lot of fun with it. If not, maybe just stop at 2/3 and imagine an alternative ending."

","10 Cloverfield Lane will beat you up, drag down the stairs and then suddenly act like an old friend who will tell you some good jokes and offer a few beers. Just to beat you up to death again 10 minutes later. And with all due respect to Dwayne Johnson, it's John Goodman who should be called The Rock. Damn. It's such a relief to finally see a great thriller, one of the most abused genres probably. And a good sci-fi thriller is even a more rare specimen.<br/><br/>The film feels way more powerful and will scare the hell out of you more than any of its big scale rivals, even though it's mostly set in an apartment with just three characters. No cheap tricks or limb amputation. The thrill feels more like a Hitchcockian kind of suspense. You don't know what's happening – just some clues, most of which will be wrong. You have no idea where the story will turn now – the amount of jaw dropping plot turns is incredible. Mary Elisabeth Winstead (still a very underrated actress) deserves the highest appraisal too.<br/><br/>An exemplary thriller - smart, tense and well-crafted. The less you know about ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", the better. The script will keep you nervous all the time like a Russian roulette, but it's the performance of the cast that makes ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" much more than a one-trick pony."

"masonmorgan-92917","8","0","0","15 May 2017"," Invigorating twist to the alien invasion genre
","Loosely tied to Matt Reeves Cloverfield (2008), 10 Cloverfield Lane expands on the surprisingly rich Cloverfield universe while also serving as a fresh twist to the alien invasion genre. <br/><br/>The acting is simply superb, especially that of John Goodman. Incredibly intimidating and cold, he truly gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the lumbering, paranoid ex- marine. The confinement of the film's setting and the mystery surrounding our characters adds to the near Hitchcockian levels of tension, as there is literally nowhere to run.<br/><br/>The film is also written and directed very well. The film racks the tension as the quick changes in tone works to amplify the viewer's unease. Subtle emotional connection, gut-wrenching tension and the full-on horror aspects all land perfectly, making the film an unpredictable, and quite flavourful, experience. <br/><br/>The only issue I had with 10 Cloverfield Lane is the final 15 minutes or so. Without spoiling anything, the film reaches it's explosive climax in a way that closes our main character's arc off nicely, but sadly goes overboard in the process. The quick switch from tense, conservative thrills to full-blown action is quite jarring, and doesn't seem to quite fit in with the tone that the rest of the film sets.<br/><br/>Overall, 10 Cloverfield is an engaging, rock-solid gem that is guaranteed to turn knuckles white. While the final stretch oversteps it's tonal boundaries plotted within the first hours of the film, it doesn't ruin them, making this an electrifying and immensely gripping surprise."

","10 Cloverfield Lane is extremely engrossing and entertaining to watch. From the start it gives you a shock and shows you a version of reality that is dark and disturbing but you have no choice but to see it and even believe it. Within the confines of a small house three actors give great and believable performances. The film is great in taking you through a series of phases from panic, to calm, to normal until all hell breaks loose. John Goodman is fantastic as the so called protector and preacher of the evil that exists outside. As the film goes on the mystery and questions increase and you question what is and isn't real. The ending might make a number of viewers laugh in disbelief. <br/><br/>This film is one of the best apocalyptic films I have seen to date and it is recommended."
"brando647","8","0","0","10 May 2017"," The ""Blood Relative"" to 2008's CLOVERFIELD is a Surprisingly Effective Thriller
","In a world of unnecessary sequels to movies that no one asked for, J.J. Abrams and director Dan Trachtenberg snuck in under the radar to show us how to do it right. 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE came out of nowhere and blew everyone away, scoring highly with critics and audiences. I have to imagine the fact that this movie was barely publicized until it was ready to drop really gave it a boost. I seriously doubt anyone was walking around prior to its release saying, ""You know what movie really needs a sequel? That 'found footage' POV monster movie from 2008."" I know I never would've considered it, and I was a fan of that movie. Meanwhile, forces behind the scenes were crafting a new installment that, really, isn't so much a sequel as perhaps instead another tale in some sort of CLOVERFIELD anthology series. Aside from the title (in this case, referring to an actual street in the film) and the usual reference to Slusho you find in any J.J. Abrams project, there is nothing to connect 10 CLOVERFIELD LAND to its predecessor. The fact that Abrams and Paramount didn't come out and announce production on a CLOVERFIELD film meant that there would be no hype machine to start placing potentially unreasonable expectations on the film that might lead to audience disappointment. They were able to create the film they wanted to create without the movie news media breathing down their backs for spoilers and drop it in our laps.<br/><br/>The love for 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE is certainly warranted. Just as the first film told a science fiction story from an unusual perspective, this one dips its toe in that same format by placing the audience in the middle of some doomsday apocalyptic scenario from the cozy confines of an underground bunker. Or is it? That is the crux of the majority of the film that focuses on Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an aspiring fashion designer who's just run out on her fiancé. As she's driving through Louisiana to put some distance between her and her ex, she's involved in a horrible car accident and awakens in the underground survival bunker of Howard (John Goodman). She's rightfully terrified at first of Howard's intentions but he proceeds to explain that there's been an attack on the United States. Some sort of biological weapon had been utilized that's made the surface unlivable and, gee, wasn't it just great luck on her part that Howard found her, brought her to the bunker, and nursed her back to health from her injuries? The only other survivor in the bunker with them is a man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who had helped Howard build the bunker, and he only knows what Howard's told him about the mysterious events that've led them here. It's a lot for Michelle take in and it's made a little harder to accept due to Howard's increasingly bizarre, menacing behavior. Was there really an attack? Or are these two prisoners?<br/><br/>About 80% of this movie plays out in the one location and that could mean disaster for some movies, but 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE makes it work with some top notch production design and cinematography to make the most of the limited space, and with fantastic performances from Winstead and Goodman. Winstead does a fantastic job as the film's hero but Goodman steals the show. His performance here is one of the best he's ever done. Howard is a complex character whose intentions we can only guess at for a while before they become crystal clear, and Goodman plays it so perfectly that, even having watched this movie twice now, I still can't stop being drawn in to his character. He comes across as an awkward, lonely man who is incredibly proud of himself for having been prepared for this scenario and, seeing as how he's saved the lives of these two young folk, expects them to live by his very strict rules. But there's always that nagging doubt that something isn't right with him and, just when you think you've got him pegged as a con artist, the movie reveals some nugget of truth behind what he's told them. It keeps you guessing as to whether something disastrous has really occurred on the surface and Howard is just a bit of a creep, or whether the ""attack"" is all a lie to keep Michelle and Emmett as willing prisoners to a dangerous psychopath in this man's isolated underground concrete prison.<br/><br/>All of that is amazing. Everything in the bunker is just great and I would've been fine if the movie ended when that was all resolved, but there's still another twenty minutes or so after that where everything goes a little nuts. For me, the story was all about Michelle and Howard and the science fiction stuff was just added spice to an excellent story. We didn't need a whole section with just the spice. You ever eat a spoonful of turmeric? It's unpleasant. And that heaping spoonful of sci-fi craziness at the end of 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE sours it a bit. But don't let that concern you (assuming you're reading this before having watched it) because it's not enough to ruin the overall fun of this surprise unnecessary (but very welcome) ""sequel""."

","If you go into 10 Cloverfield Lane expecting a direct sequel to 2008's Cloverfield, you'll be disappointed (and probably a little confused). It's meant to be a sort of ""blood relative"" — it's been implied that the movies exist in the same alternate universe, but they aren't meant to be directly connected in the sense that there are the same characters, the same monsters, etc. <br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane was adapted from a spec script titled The Cellar, written by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken. From my understanding, the original script of The Cellar was changed a decent amount — in Campbell and Stuecken's version there was no alien attack, and the ending in general had a much different, more helpless feel to it. I have to say just based on that info I like this interpretation quite a bit better.<br/><br/>The basic plot has Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) getting into a car accident as she rushes off after an argument with her fiancé. When she wakes up, she's chained in an underground bunker with her captor, Howard (John Goodman), and another prisoner, Emmett (John Gallager Jr.). She is told by both men that there has been some kind of attack and that the air outside is unbreathable, so they must stay in the bunker that Howard has been prepping for years. Michelle starts to gather clues to indicate not only that Howard may be lying, but that they may not have been his first prisoners but when she escapes, the outside world isn't too friendly.<br/><br/>This movie is great because it's scary in much more subtle ways. Michelle's car accident is pretty epic, and when she wakes up chained up in this concrete bunker, you immediately start to feel panicked and claustrophobic along with her. John Goodman — who I loved so much as Dan in Roseanne — is kind of scarily good at being this intimidating, powerful force. He's the classic abuser, really. He can switch from being kind and making an effort to connect when it suits him to being short and nasty on a dime — you never know what kind of response you're going to get, and his reactions are often out of proportion with what's going on. He takes any hint of complaint or questioning as a personal attack, and repeatedly demands that Michelle and Emmett be grateful for all he's done for them. He speaks for Michelle on more than one occasion, particularly when he tells Emmett to stop joking around and that she doesn't think it's funny. He lies and covers up those lies effortlessly, always trying to make himself into the good guy, into the under- appreciated one, not least of all when he admits to crashing into Michelle's car on purpose, but insists that he did it to save her. It's terrifying, to say the least, to imagine waking up to such an unstable captor.<br/><br/>You initially are convinced that Howard is some kind of psychotic abductor, clearly, with Michelle restrained in an empty room but then you meet Emmett, who is all too happy to be there. When you hear about the apparently inhabitable world outside, you're wary but then, as Michelle tries to escape, a woman covered in skin lesions pounds on the door, desperate to be let inside and saved, before collapsing. The whole movie is very back and forth, giving you evidence of one side but then countering that evidence with a reasonable explanation. It's disorienting to not be sure what is happening or who to be suspicious of.<br/><br/>The movie almost starts to take a happy turn at one point — showing the three of them co-existing happily, lounging on the couch reading, having dinner together — but then Howard discovers some of his tools missing and questions them, threatening them with a large barrel of perchloric acid. We, again, are reminded of just how short Howard's temper is and how disproportionately he is capable of reacting as he accepts Emmett's apology and then suddenly, shockingly, shooting him on the spot. I'm pretty sure both my husband and I jumped out of our seats in that moment — both a fantastic sudden scare but also a moment that inspires a lump in your throat as you feel the intense fear that Michelle must be feeling in that moment.<br/><br/>The whole escaping process is pretty awesome chaos, with Howard growling at Michelle as he tries to catch her and keep her secluded in his bunker. Again, more with the back and forth as she gets outside and hears birds chirping and for a moment we think that everything worked out, she got loose AND the world is perfectly fine but then we see a huge alien craft in the distance (which is awesomely terrifying). Michelle fights her way out of yet another intense situation and as she leaves she's faced with the option to either go north to wait out the disaster or head to Houston where they are in need of troops to fight and she makes the turn to Houston. I know there were lots of complaints about the ending seeming disjointed and random in comparison with the rest of the movie, but I like the idea of it adding to her character, and adding to her struggle — she may have escaped her captor, her abuser, but that doesn't mean the world outside of that hell is all roses and unicorns. They spent a small chunk of time elaborating on Michelle's inclination to run when things get tough, to disengage and I think the ending was a great way of showing her finding her strength, knowing what kinds of dangers await her in Houston but making that choice anyway to stand up and fight. I thought it was powerful, and, of course, the alien presence exists as a tie-in to the whole Cloverfield universe.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a great, on-the-edge-of-your-seat film."

","Plot; A young woman is in a car accident and awakens inside the underground shelter of a man who claims that aboveground is now uninhabitable.<br/><br/>Taut, tense thriller for the bulk of its running time, but the last 15 minutes or so feel grafted on to make it match up with the decade old found footage film Cloverfield. The latter I've seen once, with chunks of it on fast forward thanks to an overload of shaky cam and extremely unlikeable characters, such as they are. Cloverfield Lane is a more traditional film, with three co-leads who each give compelling, albeit vastly different, performances. It's ultimately their interaction that makes this worth a watch, somewhat lame finale aside."

Howard's bunker doesn't have so much as a radio. Okay, maybe he has reasons to keep things secret - even if he's right about aliens (because he is crazy and wants a 'family') with him.

","First off, I'm rating it 9/10 purely because there should have been a little more 'alien activity' rather than the last 5-10 minutes of movie. <br/><br/>Even though it was pure intense suspense from start to near the end, it worked a bloody treat because I was on the edge of my seat wondering what the heck was going on, what was going to happen next.. John Goodman made this film what it was, a terrifying feeling of something awful about to happen around every corner. I constantly thought aliens were going to find a way in to the bunker and wreak havoc, but nope, he comes across as a little bit crazy, especially to the 2 co-stars of this movie.<br/><br/>The score was perfect, cast and acting..

","10 Cloverfield Lane is an intense, thrilling and claustrophobic experience that holds you on edge for the full runtime...even the end.<br/><br/>The movie is brilliantly told with a great use of pure visual storytelling, and an perfect underlining score. The protagonist of this film (fantastic as always Mary Elizabeth Winstead) doesn't even say a word until 10 minutes into the movie, and why should she? What we've seen to this point told us everything we needed to know.<br/><br/>But that's also due to the fantastic performances by everyone, most of all John Goodman who portrays one of the most intriguing characters i've seen in a long time, with great expertise, the only downside is that his character doesn't get a proper ending, which get's me to the only negative thing i have to say about this fantastic Thriller...<br/><br/>...and that's the connection to the movie ""Cloverfield"". In my opinion the movie could have worked much better without it, on it's own, and here is why: <br/><br/>The movie wasn't even supposed to be a sequel, but i understand why they made it that way. Dan Trachtenberg seemed to have a nice idea for a great movie and J.J. Abrams wanted to help him push his directorial debut, so he produced it and made it out to be the movie it became. I think that's not a bad idea and i think that everyone should get a great chance like this.<br/><br/>The problem is, that the movie now had to have a connection that wasn't there originally and it shows. To make it possible they had to get rid of John Goodmans intriguing character to set up the new threat of the Alien invasion that took place. His character was the only one who knew and believed that such a invasion would take place and so he made his own bunker and saved two people out of compassion, he seems to be a crazy at times, but in the end he was right and just wanted to save what he could, like most people would do.<br/><br/>Now this review is already marked with a spoiler-warning, which means people who read it should have seen the movie, so i just tell my version of a more interesting ending for this already great movie:<br/><br/>What if we just erase the nowhere-going plot-point of Howard being a kidnapper before, so that he's not just a pure antagonist, now everything goes like in the film, Michelle gets out sees that there are the Alien monsters in the background as well as the gas pumping spaceship, knows that Howard was right all along and just wanted them to be safe, the bunker blows up and with it the last safe place on earth and then it just ends. It's a more interesting and apocalyptic take on the story and i'm pretty sure that's how it would have ended if it doesn't had to build for a Cloverfield-series.<br/><br/>BUT all in all i really liked this film and was entertained throughout, how they told the story was near perfection, and i have nothing against how they handled the end, i just think they wasted a bit of potential on their most interesting character..."

","I did like the film, even thought it was a bit slow at times. I did have a question though about why someone would be chained up if they were trying to be helped. Goodman plays his role well, and I am sure there is a bit of truth behind the person that he plays. The two men at first seemed to be in cahoots with each other, but it is soon realized that Goodmans character was an extreme alpha male with a bit of a complex. 95% of the film takes place in one location, and I like those kinds of films. The acting was spot on, the effects seemed good, and it leaves a person asking the question....is this a hostage situation, or were the words of Goodmans character the truth?"

It has a plot twist that you wouldn't expect or at least you won't be able to predict it accurately. While watching you're not sure about anything. We get the answer but with it the main character has even bigger problems than the one before Everyone have their own struggles and demons.

"SeakDub","6","0","0","7 February 2017"," A Good Suspense That Falls Flat.
","If you are wondering what the movie 10 Cloverfield Lane is, well lets say it is a decent suspense film in the same universe as the Cloverfield movie. And I think that was a brilliant idea especially how the movie plays out and makes you wonder what in John Goodman's mind is going on. I was loving it. Gives you that intense creep feel throughout the movie, just waiting to see how this is all going to end. And then the epilogue comes and you feel a stab in your stomach, and realize they just took what could have been an epic ending and turned it into Hollywood's money gimmick. So from here, if you haven't seen the movie and what to know why I think it is a great and awful film continue on. Otherwise don't read on, I will go into much detail on the ending. <br/><br/>So again, the beginning, middle, and just up to the end was a fun movie to watch. It makes you guess and wonder what is going to happen. It gives you goosebumps wondering how are they going to tie this movie in with Cloverfield. I think that idea alone makes this movie that much more intense. To have two separate movies that gives you different feels, beautiful! You imagine you know what is going on in the outside world(if you seen Cloverfield), so we go along in this movie inside a safe shelter. John Goodman's character is wonderful to me, winning an award for best villain! You feel for him, then scared, then terrified of this guy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job and wouldn't have asked for anyone else. <br/><br/>While this movie mainly takes place in a shelter, it does a great job on just the story, character growth, and the suspense waiting for the climatic moment. The music was on par. I think they did a very great job on it. I was actually loving the buildup/intense sounds, amazing job there! <br/><br/>Then finally, the moment is here. I'm going through my head what is to come when we see the outside world. And bam! Hollywood takes over, they did their thing and just ruined everything about this movie to me. I can't say this is all Hollywood's fault, it could've be who wrote it, J.J. Abrams for all I know. The reason I'm saying Hollywood and a money gimmick is the fact you had a movie that wasn't anything like Cloverfield, but in the same universe waiting to see how it ties in. To just get alien ships flying in, killing humans on sight. Random cheesy fight scene. A lady who was terrified of John Goodman's character to somehow take on an alien ship with a molotov cocktail and win? Survives, and goes to fight in a town where they are being attacked by aliens trying to wipe us out. All that enraged me. How did Cloverfield, which centered around a giant alien, yes I know it fell from space I guess, that spawned creepy little aliens to this movie having alien ships, giant alien ships trying to take us over. How many alien movies can I name that have that plot? War of the Worlds, Independence Day, Skyline(ugh), Mars Attack!, Signs, Battle Los Angeles. Off the top of my head. <br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is, why go that route? Why couldn't we have got a better ending, something that tied it into Cloverfield? All those movies I listed could have been in the same universe. Why call this one a Cloverfield? Why not 10 Independence Day Lane? A dark ending that fits in with the dark element of the movie, not an action hero ending. Have her come out of the shelter and see the monster from Cloverfield fighting Godzilla would have been way better. But from what I hear, the script is/was meant for another film after this. Money gimmick is how I see it. They could have ended this movie which showed us actual more of the monster or story. But we get alien ships. Only reason I gave it a 6/10 was because the rest of the movie held up. Not the ending, if that is your type of movie I say go for it. Otherwise, pass!!"

","A young woman Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)becomes involved in a car accident and wakes up to find herself in an underground nuclear bunker. Michelle, along with another man called Emmett (John Gallagher Jr) is being held in this bunker by Howard (John Goodman). Howard informs Michelle that there has been some kind of chemical/nuclear attack and that everyone else has been killed by this attack. Michelle is unnerved by Howard, but he assures her that he has rescued her and that he intends to look after her. Emmett witnessed Howard building the bunker and breaks into his bunker when he learns of the apocalypse. However, Michelle and Emmett both sense there is something not quite right about Howard and using Michelle's creative prowess they plot their escape.<br/><br/>For the most part, 10 Cloverfield Lane is so well-crafted and well-put together that's it's hard to believe that it was directed by someone who, at the time of writing this review, has only got 3 short films to his name. Trachtenberg mounts the tension admirably and in the early stages this film reminded me a little bit of Oldboy; Michelle has seemingly being abducted for unknown reasons, her captor explains why she's been held, but she doesn't know whether or not to believe in what she is being told by her captor. Howard's Jekyll and Hyde nature means that you're never quite sure what he is going to do from one minute to the next. There are moments in the film where everyone seems to be getting along, then other moments where Howard flairs up for no apparent reason and other occasions where he appears to be relatively calm in the aftermath of being attacked by Michelle. As a character, he is interesting and is someone you don't want to take your eyes away from when he's on screen. Trachtenberg also uses the enclosed environment to good effect with lots of close ups and close shots which creates a tense and claustrophobic atmosphere.<br/><br/>The performances help matters here with the likes of John Goodman & Mary Elizabeth Winstead being on particularly good form. The former is someone who is better known for playing loud, brash or comedy characters, but here he is much more low-key and subtle than normal - this is intended as a compliment as he was downright terrifying at times. Winstead is equally effective in her respective role; clever, ballsy, resourceful and ever so slightly vulnerable she's actually the sort of person who it is easy to form a rooting interest in. Gallagher Jr is OK, but never really makes the same impression on the picture as Goodman or Winstead.<br/><br/>The final 25 minutes are just a mixture of mad and crazy; the chase round the bunker between Michelle and Howard was exciting, albeit a tad predictable and all the alien stuff at the end was just crazy beyond words. I believe that this film is somehow linked to the original Cloverfield from 2008 so perhaps I shouldn't have been entirely surprised by what happened at the end, but given the way things were unfolding I expected the ending to be slightly more tense and powerful and I have to admit that the ending was slightly disappointing. Despite this though, the film does mostly work and although I found the ending slightly disappointing I have to admit that it still has plenty of good qualities."

","This movie has ""Coverfield"" in the name, and shares at least a director with that earlier movie. In fact, I bought it on blu-ray in a double pack. So, having seen the earlier movie, which was a very humdrum affair in all respects except the visual arts, I wasn't expecting much.<br/><br/>In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. 10CL centres on the tense relationships between three people confined -- willingly or not -- in a survival bunker. Some unspecified ""attack"" has taken place, and it seems that the outside world is uninhabitable. It looks OK, however, through the airlock window, so the real situation is unclear. As the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the owner of the bunker is somewhat unstable, and may even be a murderer. The three folks in the bunker are the only actors with more than a couple of lines, and all the performances are excellent.<br/><br/>But (spoiler coming...) Having seen Cloverfield, I always assumed that space monsters or some-such would be involved somewhere. I mean, why would the filmmakers choose this name except to make that exact connection? This rather killed the suspense for me. Had the link been unclear -- had it been uncertain right up until the last moment whether the surface was safe or not -- it would have been a better movie. Sure, ""Howard"" -- the bunker's owner -- is a fruitcake, and he may have a sinister motive for keeping a young woman trapped. But that in no way precludes a genuine disaster having taken place as well.<br/><br/>There is an FAQ entry attached to this IMDb entry that says, essentially, that the film-makers did not intend any particular relationship between 10CL and Cloverfield. It's true that we don't see the same monsters, and there are continuity problems if the events in 10CL are intended to follow directly after those in Cloverfield. But I assumed right from the start that when Howard suggested the world had been invaded by ""Martians"", he was referring to the events in Cloverfield. So when the monsters eventually appeared, I was not surprised. I'm only surprised that other reviewers found the ending genuinely unexpected -- I can only imagine that they never saw Cloverfield, or had forgotten its plot.<br/><br/>In short, this is a potentially excellent movie, slightly let down by the plot give-away inherent in its title and authorship."

Which is more of a question than a statement to be truthful, but I'll let it stay.<br/><br/>There are actually a lot of questions in this one. One of them being if there actually are Aliens as proposed by Goodmans character or if he's just crazy. The road name adds to the mystery and there are a lot of strange things that may interpreted in one way or another.

","This movie was intelligently done and it had to be considering the setting. Just about the entirety of this movie takes place in a multi-room, underground bunker of about 400-500 square feet (rough guesstimate). When a film is limited in its setting to that degree it has a smaller margin of error for being watchable.<br/><br/>I had my doubts about this movie going in because of the word ""cloverfield"". My memories of the other movie titled simply ""Cloverfield"" were not good. Shaky-cam POV comes to mind and that is not my cup of tea.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is shot more traditionally and they employed the services of a known actor in John Goodman. The movie is filmed completely from the perspective of Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the main character. After leaving a gas station she gets involved in an accident just to wake up chained to a wall in a bunker. The bunker belongs to her captor, Howard (John Goodman), and he is trying to convince her that he has her there for her own good. Is he telling the truth or is he not? There are indicators that he is but then there are indicators that he is a nut case as well.<br/><br/>It is an intense movie. Michelle is caught in a quandary and her goal of getting answers and/or freedom require a lot of daring behavior. John Goodman does a stellar job as an enigmatic captor/savior. He is hard to read throughout the movie which makes him and the situation all the more confusing and scary. The movie was just really well put together."

Instead, it keeps it intelligent and fresh, at first pushing the boundaries of the classics with a blatant throwback to The Silence of The Lambs and a soft kiss on the lips of Misery.<br/><br/>Soon after, and much to my surprise, it treads off into uncharted lands, descending darkly into an amalgam of genres; from drama to suspense and horror, all the way to sci-fi absurdity – but always brushed with a feather-light, cautious, Hitchcockian touch.<br/><br/>Is it a sequel? A prequel? Does it have anything at all to do with Reeves' 2008 Cloverfield? I don't know and I don't really care.

"sddavis63","6","0","0","17 January 2017"," A Good Suspense-Thriller Weakened By An Unnecessary Sci-Fi Turn At The End
","For the most part, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a very good thriller, very suspenseful and certainly manages to keep the viewers on the edge of their seat. From the start you're not entirely sure what's happening, and the scenes in the bunker are almost surreal in the way they move from menacing to sheer domestic. The atmosphere in the bunker was superb, and fit the genre of the movie perfectly, and director Dan Trachtenberg used it well. The highlight of the movie for me was John Goodman. I confess that I'm not really a big fan of Goodman, but I'd be prepared to say that this may have been the best performance I've seen him give. As Howard, he can be both scary and charming, and there's mystery about him. From the very start you don't really know if he's a good guy or a bad guy; if he's telling the truth or lying through his teeth. <br/><br/>The movie begins with a car accident. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is leaving her boyfriend and gets into a bad accident. When she awakens she's chained to the wall in a room, apparently a prisoner of Howard. But is she a prisoner? Howard tells her that there's been some type of attack (nuclear or chemical) and that he found her and brought her into the bunker to save her life, because the air outside is unbreathable. Is that true? We wonder for a while, but there seems to be enough supporting his story to make us believe him. There's a second prisoner or guest - Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) about whom we learn very little. How did he get there? We're not sure. Howard, Emmett and Michelle seem to settle in for the long haul, convinced that they can't get out. Howard is a bit unbalanced, and you get the impression that you can never really be sure how he's going to react to things. He clearly was a prepper - believing that something like this was going to happen, and maybe a little bit shocked that it actually did. Emmett and Michelle wonder about escaping - but escaping to where? Is there anything left outside the bunker? Could they survive if they left?<br/><br/>It's very suspenseful, and then as far as I was concerned it was ruined by the ending, which turned into some sort of alien/sci-fi sort of film. I knew that as always a possibility, but I was hoping that the movie would take a different direction. It was working quite well for me just as the mystery of Howard and the bunker, which the confined atmosphere creating more than enough suspense. I didn't really need aliens. Somehow, for me, that took away from what had been making the movie work so well.<br/><br/>Supposedly this is described as a ""spiritual successor"" to the 2008 film ""Cloverfield."" Maybe - but you don't need to have seen ""Cloverfield"" for this to make sense. I wouldn't call it a sequel in the normal use of the term and I can't really say that anything in this really made me think about ""Cloverfield."" It's capable of standing on its own. It's a taut little suspense/thriller with an ending that could have been better."

","A woman finds herself in a bunker after a car crash but how did she get there and why is she there?. <br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a fairly slow moving film pretty much set in one place. It relies heavily on keeping the audience guessing as to what is really happening. On this score it works pretty well with plenty of red herrings thrown in along the way as the paranoia of the situation kicks in. The fact that there are spells when not much happens makes the things that do happen more sinister.<br/><br/>John Goodman is fantastic as the owner of the bunker whilst Mary Elizabeth Winstead is captivating as the woman trying to piece together what is real and what isn't. John Gallagher Jr has a lesser job as the every man but still convinces. <br/><br/>This is a film that pays to stick with as it ratchets up the tension tenfold as it nears it's climax. There is a sudden switch of pace towards the end which is a brave thing of the film makers to try. I found the ending a bit of a disappointment but I still found this an interesting mix of genres and always entertaining. <br/><br/>I was so confused as to whether I liked this film much on first watch, that I re-watched it the following day, something I rarely do.

","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is an intense, claustrophobic surprise of a film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Michelle who, in the film's urgent opening sequence, desperately flees New Orleans to escape from her fiancé Ben for reasons unexplained. In the dead of the night her car plunges off the road and she awakes to find herself a prisoner in a concrete-walled cell, attached to a drip and fed and watered by Howard (John Goodman). Michelle is understandably dubious– Howard is clearly a survivalist and she soon finds that she's not alone well-stocked hideaway. She meets Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) who apparently witnessed the attack and fled to the bunker. It soon becomes evident that something has happened outside and the trio settle into an uneasy existence underground, prepared to sit out the two years or so it might take for conditions above ground to sustain human life. <br/><br/>The film is restless and uneasy, punctuated by a sense that something just isn't right here, that the whole story isn't being told. Edgy and discomfiting, we're never allowed to sit back and relax; we're waiting for the next trauma, the next moment of explosive confrontation. Winstead is brilliant as the resourceful, desperate Michelle but Goodman is quite astonishing as gruff man- mountain Howard and the relationship that develops between the pair crackles with tension and barely-disguised threat. The film's slow burn eventually erupts into fire and violence and, without drifting too far into spoiler territory, it's fair to suggest that fans of Cloverfield frustrated by the intimate human drama of the first hour or so of Cloverfield Lane are likely to feel a bit more at home with the extraordinary turn of events which send the last reel hurtling off into an entirely different, but no less exhilarating, direction. The film does take a unique and quite different turn in the final end showing a creation of monster attacks, similar to the original. The ending also does suggest there will be another sequel. Which can be quite forward looking towards."

So I kept thinking this movie for a while and I didn't get the chance to watch this on theater because I was being dumb and choose other movie to watch, which was by the way not really great. And then I chose to watch this at home a few months later, but I forgot the title. Then today I watched some random videos on Youtube and found this movie title. YEY! And I watched it right away. First few minutes were pretty good but haven't hooked me and when the accident started, BAM! I couldn't let myself to chill a bit. Acting skills are great, not the best, but one of the best one for horror movies I've seen so far. Story lines were pretty interesting despite the not really good ending that I got on this movie. This movie was great but just saying it could've been better. I need more explanation that means I NEED THE SEQUEL OR PREQUEL ASAP"

","If you're looking for an action movie, you'll be sorely disappointed. The interesting aspects of the movie all revolve around the dialogue and analysing the intentions of the characters. If you're looking for something related to Cloverfield, or a high- energy high action movie you'll be (mostly) disappointed. <br/><br/>As a psych thriller, it did really well, keeping the viewer guessing right up until the end. Is this an elaborate hoax so that an old man can live out his deranged fantasies, or this really an apocalypse? Is the hired hand really telling the truth, or is he just playing along to lend credibility to a scheme and to earn his pay?<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie was believable as interesting as the viewer tries to analyze the motives of an unstable, delusional ex-military man.

","10 Cloverfield Lane is a simple and suspenseful film that builds interest by not giving too much away at once. from the beginning I started to make guesses and constantly kept changing it and tweaking them. At one point I was 100% sure of something and then completely doubted it. The film focuses on few characters which helps to better show how the relationship between them develops. The mood suddenly changes through out the movie so there are instances where you get the feel that there is no tension and then it abruptly escalates which kept me interested.I was not sure that I would like it at first because it takes place in a bunker and I assumed that it would be boring but it was not as boring."

","Cloverfield presents itself as a chimera of distinct genres and as we all know, crossing different species does not work in the real world. Well, in the fictionalized world of Cinema theoretically it may be done but only if masterfully orchestrated by a talented director, not a pretentious one.<br/><br/>Dan Trachtenberg just cut and pasted ""helped and imprisoned by a psychopath"" (Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Bad Boy Bubby, Misery, etc.) with ""sheltering from an unknown menace and stick together"" (The Divide, Evil Dead, etc.) and ""aliens invading with a weak spot"" (H.G. Well's War of the Worlds paraphernalia derivatives) without even bothering to stitch the different themes nor properly nor in whatever form.<br/><br/>As far as my experience goes and apart from movie genre analogies, when a script wants to grab everything for the sake of ""surprising"", just because ""To surprise"" is to be a ""fantastic"" director or writer, everything becomes predictable, boring, vain and volatile. Nothing seems to have mass or a tangible form. It becomes ridiculous unless it has stupendous performances, also not the case.<br/><br/>Some combinations are simply not congruent: <br/><br/>Hypothesis A) The Guy is a psychopath and the menace only exists in his mind - generally works;<br/><br/>Hypothesis B) The Guy is right but severely stressed and indeed there is a menace outside - generally works;<br/><br/>Hypothesis C) The Guy is a lunatic and there is indeed a menace outside and we've been ""fooled"" all the time (wasn't this movie supposed to be connected with ""Cloverfield"" at the first time?) by an elusive script which jumps from the 1st to the 2nd hypothesis to culminate on the fusion of both (wow) - it becomes rubbish if a movie pretends to be realistic or the director is a glutton of genres.<br/><br/>This piece of crap (pity for John Goodman because he has done a satisfactory work and he is a very talented actor) represents a Hollywood stereotype of movies made by directors ""full of original ideas"" who generate cheap ""bombastic"" dry firepower movies wrapped by a sparkling marketing and destined for ignorant audiences who will justify the profit of the movie by ephemerally paying its tickets on a one night debut."

","If you were to watch this movie having not seen the first movie I believe you'd judge it to be an average thriller/horror movie with a quirky ending, nothing more. Having watched the previous movie I thought it was a decent installment! <br/><br/>It had some interesting dynamic mystery elements throughout, which was a surprise. The movie somehow managed to get me to question the motives of the detainer, even though its obvious we all know an alien invasion has taken place (if you have seen the first movie). <br/><br/>It had a completely different feel from Cloverfield. Telling a completely different story, from a similar time-frame. However, the reason I rated it a 6 is due to the fact that the first Cloverfield was all about Sci-Fi alien ACTION! Up close and personal!! I enjoyed the suspense but only felt the film really got going until the final 15- 20 minutes, which then went on to clearly set up for another installment! <br/><br/>I'm very happy about the possibility of another Cloverfield movie coming out in the future, and this has laid more foundations down for the next one. <br/><br/>I hope I get to learn more about the attackers!"

","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is the unofficial sequel to the 2008 film 'Cloverfield'. This time however, we are treated to nice steady cinematography instead of the shaky ""found footage"" from the original. This is probably because the film is trapped underground. Away from any carnage or mayhem that may or may not be occurring on the surface. This isn't the monster movie that the original was, no, this is supposed to be a psychological thriller. I say ""supposed to be"" because it never really got to me in any meaningful ways. It stays fairly confined and small in scale, which isn't a bad thing. It just forces you to make this a character driven film instead of being story driven. And that is why '10 Colverfield Lane' abounds in mediocrity. Aside from John Goodman, who delivers an outstanding performance as the disturbed Howard, there isn't much to like. This is made worse when the only other characters in the film are so flat and uninspired. <br/><br/>Mary Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. deliver solid performances but the characters they portray are less than solid. Gallagher plays a country boy, so he's kind of an idiot and Winstead plays a girl so she's kind of irrational. That's about it. It literally takes the stereotypes of these people and makes that their only real, discernible trait. Beyond this, it's nearly impossible to come up with any other traits that defined these characters as human beings.<br/><br/>They where essentially plot devices in the John Goodman gun show. (Who really does offer an excellent performance) His character, Howard, is the only interesting part of this film. He is manipulative, conniving, eerie, and incredibly unsettling. His presence anchors this film in a rather convoluted reality.<br/><br/>A reality that makes less and less sense the more the film plugs along. While I will say that the film did a great job of clouding the truth that lay just outside this under ground bunker, it doesn't amount to much. There are multiple plot lines that take effect here and not one is seen through to the end.<br/><br/>Once we finally emerge from the metal deathtrap the film really nose dives. There is so much tension built by this point that even a mediocre conclusion would have been satisfactory. But it's not even that good. The best word I can use to describe it without spoiling anything is sloppy. It was so slapped together that basic continuity is thrown out the window just so they could hurry and wrap things up.<br/><br/>While everything else is generally meh, there is one other thing that was truly awful, the sound design. I get that this is a thriller, and a thriller without jump scares just wouldn't appeal to modern audiences but did every single sound have to be ear splitting in volume? Any thump or crash is so deafeningly loud that it actually detracts from the scene. The film is trying to jump scare us so hard that it over exaggerates every single noise we hear. <br/><br/>By the end I was so tired of this that legitimate scares didn't get to me. I sat starring blankly at the screen waiting for it roll credits. Again, not everything is bad though. If you have any desire to see this film you will most likely leave genuinely impressed by Goodman. The film pitches him the most complex character and he knocks it out of the park. But when nearly everything else is so uninspired it makes '10 Cloverfield Lane' seriously difficult to sit through."

","I was extremely excited to see this film, I loved cloverfield and I really enjoyed how they advertised this. I liked that the trailer didn't show too much and left a lot out to make you really wonder what is actually going on.<br/><br/>The movie plays out the same way, you spend the majority of the movie in anticipation of finding out what exactly is going on. The small cast does a good job of keeping things entertaining as you wait for the reveal, John Goodman especially. Unfortunately what it all leads up to was very underwhelming in my opinion. The movie has a nice claustrophobic feel to it which makes things more tense than they should be, but that kind of gets thrown out the window in the last twenty five minutes or so. <br/><br/>Basically what it comes down to is this is a captive type thriller that leads up to one big gimmick. It's as if they decided to make a small thriller but then all of a sudden someone through them a big chunk of money and told them to make the ending as big as possible. I enjoyed the movie, but mostly because of the performances from the small cast, the whole ""Cloverfield"" type stuff just kind of took away from the whole experience.<br/><br/>I liked the movie, but the finale didn't do it for me and just made the film feel really cheesy. <br/><br/>6/10"
"stephendaxter","8","3","8","14 March 2016"," A fantastic spin on an existing franchise, backed by amazing performances
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a Drama / Mystery Thriller that is a standalone film and a spin off to 2008's Cloverfield. I have not seen Cloverfield but i have heard quite a bit about it since its release 8 years ago. But really, you don't need to know a thing about Cloverfield to see this film. If you have seen Cloverfield then i guess you kinda know what you are dealing with here, but if you haven't seen the film, this spin off is a fantastic standalone film that i can tell you had my full uninterrupted attention. This was a fantastic movie that was intense, dramatic, and had a tinge of humour thrown in there, i was completely engaged and on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was very well crafted in many departments and was backed by three absolutely perfect performances. <br/><br/>The pacing of this film was pretty much perfect for most of the film, it slowly builds to some big moments and when not much is happening, it keeps you in the film with a clever use of music and a creepy score. There was a 5-10 minute section of the film in the middle that did start to drag but it quickly moved along to some more juicy material. I gotta also note that the dialogue in this film was on point. It is so easy to write cheesy dialogue that is clearly just actors reading off a script, but they managed to have really interesting dialogue so that you completely buy into the conversations they are having. The 3 main characters are also very grounded and fully fleshed out, and that was done amazingly in a short amount of time, getting it out of the way quickly. You really learn to love these characters or love to hate them, and that is because of the great writing in the film. But it is also down to the 3, absolutely fantastic performances leading this film. <br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. were just downright amazing in this film and were 110% committed to their roles. Winstead and Goodman in particular elevated this film so much with their performances, it would not have been anywhere near as good with anyone else. The back and forth between those two made the film so much more intense and dramatic and added a lot of weight to certain parts of the film. The visual style of the film and the cinematography are also something to note because it was beautiful. The way the film was shot in this bunker made every scene a little bit more appealing to watch. It won't be winning any awards but it was a surprising highlight of the film. <br/><br/>8.3/10 <br/><br/>So, VERY MINOR spoilers ahead (NOTHING PLOT RELATED)<br/><br/>One last thing that i absolutely have to talk about is the amazing way in which this film handled being part of an existing franchise but at the same time being its own thing, and how this could be the beginning of a revolution in filmmaking regarding spinoffs and standalone films. As you may already know, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a spin off from 2008's Cloverfield and unlike other spinoffs it wasn't concerned with trying to connect itself to the universe every 5-10 minutes. It just went and did its own thing, told its own story whilst still being in the same world. Really, if you didn't know it was connected to Cloverfield going in, you won't walk away being confused and left 'out of the loop'. This film very much stands completely on its own and isn't restricted by having to conform to what the previous film set for it. <br/><br/>This is the PERFECT way to create new and interesting ideas within a franchise to avoid becoming repetitive to the point where no-one is interested in the franchise anymore. Look at the genre's of these two films for example, Cloverfield was an Action/Adventure/Horror filmed as a found footage film, and this is a Drama/Mystery Thriller that took the franchise in a completely new direction. I still haven't seen Cloverfield but i want to see more standalone films set in this same world to see what they can do to change it up every time. I can only hope that more franchises see the success of this film and introduce similar ideas within their worlds. The only thing i think would stand in the way of this becoming a common sight in Hollywood is if a studio tries it and completely messes it up that will turn off other studios from trying it. But i hope that doesn't happen and we get more films that take a similar approach to this one."
"aciessi","8","3","8","13 March 2016"," Nothing Shaky About This
","Dan Trachtenberg and J.J. Abrams are either absolute geniuses, or contemptuous trolls. Because, by calling the film 10 Cloverfield Lane, they duped all of social media into thinking that this was a sequel to the 2008 found-footage monster movie, Cloverfield. Boy, did they get you all good. I'd give this a spoiler alert, but as a cinephile, I know better, and so should all of you. I sniffed out the ""hype"" culture surrounding this film from the minute it dropped unexpectedly online.<br/><br/>But a film being ""overhyped"" is certainly not the same thing as a film being bad, disappointing, or even just O.K. 10 Cloverfield Lane turns out to be better than anyone thought it was going to be. This is a brilliant return-to-form for the psychological thriller genre. I was reminded the whole time of Misery. What I mean is, it's a film that freaks you out, without ever being gory and overly stylized. This film never jumps through hoops to scare you, and yet it's lack of effort scares you even more. Films like this used to be made much more often, but that was a time when films weren't made for profit. I guess that's the reason as to why they named it 10 Cloverfield Lane. They knew it was a great film, but they had to make sure it made money.. by attaching Cloverfield to it. Sure, it's lame, but at least a whole new audience can have a whole new appreciation for the psychological thriller!<br/><br/>My praise goes straight to John Goodman. It feels like a decade since we last saw him on screen, or at least that's what it seems, because I'm wondering to myself, where has this guy been? He's one of the great actors. He is electrifying in this. He's a monster, and no, I don't mean the kind that destroyed Manhattan in the 2008 film. We never know what he's about, why he's so crazed, and how much he was fabricating the truth about the situation he put our main character in, but the film keeps us guessing. In the end, we aren't given all the answers, and neither were we given a ""gotcha"" style ending, that would've left the audience howling, as expected. But that's the charm of this film. Sometimes, less is more, and less isn't at all what hype surrounding this movie wanted you to think. Yet, here we are, we all ended up seeing a great film, and that's all that matters.<br/><br/>I left the theater pretty satisfied, and pretty entertained. Might I say, so far, 2016 has been an awesome year at the movies, and if it keeps up, I'm going to have a blast."
"Laakbaar","8","3","8","13 March 2016"," Is Howard their saviour or kidnapper?
","After Michelle gets into a car crash, she wakes up in an underground bunker with two men. The girl assumes she and Emmett have been abducted by redneck Howard, but then learns that she has actually been saved from an apocalyptic event of some kind because the air is now poisonous. However, there is a good deal of doubt about this, so much of the tension in the movie is based on Michelle's uncertainty about whether Howard is lying. Is he a good guy or is he a ""horror opa"" as we say in Dutch. <br/><br/>SPOILER! Shocking events take place that confirm both sides of the story are true: something terrible is happening up top and Howard is a homicidal kidnapper of young girls. Yes, this is tangentially at least an apocalyptic movie about alien invasion; however, it is also a gripping story about forcible confinement.<br/><br/>At first this movie bothered me because of Michelle's emotional state and utter stupidity. She has the accident while texting in the car. The start of this movie will appeal more to those who think women are emotional wrecks, dangerous drivers and helpless ninnies. However, as the movie progresses this problem dispelled for me. We see Michelle's strength emerge. She becomes a strong figure who does what she needs to do to try to survive.<br/><br/>The movie seemed to be implausible at first and based on an absurd writing prompt. It does have an artificial, crazy story line. Some of it reminded me of ""The Divide"", to be honest, especially her escape at the end.<br/><br/>However, it worked well. I enjoyed it. All three actors played their roles well.<br/><br/>From what I can see, this movie has nothing to do with ""Cloverfield"", although there is apparently a cinematographic connection of some kind."

","10 Cloverfield Lane.<br/><br/>Dullsville, USA <br/><br/>With its dramatic irony (given away in the film's title) 10 Cloverfield plays like a lethargic, overly long Twilight Zone episode. And a low-budget first round to an upcoming much better movie. <br/><br/>I started admiring the colorful theater carpet around 50 minutes in. Not a good sign. But what pretty abstract designs that rug has!<br/><br/>No one in the theater enjoyed this pic, neither young nor old. It was heart-warming though to see a pack of 17-year-olds bond with the 60-year-old couple over their dislike of the film.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield starts with a bang. However, like many movies that do, it's at the expense of character building and engendering audience empathy. I couldn't care less about this heroine. And she has no transformational arc because of the failure to set up her character in the first few minutes of the film.<br/><br/>If the plot twist at the end wasn't given away by the movie's title, this story of going out of the frying pan and into the fire would have been much more effective.

"Sweet_and_Lowdown77","Null","3","8","13 March 2016"," Interesting premise, but ultimately unsatisfying
","I was incredibly interested to see this film. But then one of the reasons why I was interested ended up being one of the reasons the film simply doesn't work. I have one major script issue and one issue by marketing that IMO ruins the film.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>THE SCRIPT:<br/><br/>I actually loved the way the film starts and gets into the story. I was even with the film all the way until we reach the point where Howard kills Emmett. IMO, this was an incredibly weak choice. At that point, Howard cradles Michelle and tells her ""it's okay, this is how it was supposed to be.""<br/><br/>Meaning Howard PLANNED to only have Michelle at the bunker. Which means his accident story is false. Which means he was - during an attack - driving around looking for a girl to be with him in the bunker all before the air is poisoned? What are the odds he would find a girl under those conditions at that time? It was reaching to make that Howard's ""plan all along"".<br/><br/>I thought the trailer gave away the end, but it didn't. I loved that twist. Where we think Michelle is escaping but sees that Howard's telling the truth.<br/><br/>I just felt that the screenwriters didn't use Emmett well at all. He wasn't a decoy, he was simply there.<br/><br/>Also, do we really believe Emmett could've overpowered Howard into the Bunker? Or convinced Howard to take him in? If Howard TRULY just wanted it to be him & Michelle, he would've killed Emmett before Michelle ever woke up.<br/><br/>I was hoping the filmmakers were going to use ""Howard being Evil"" that second time as a rouse. That the reason Emmett knew about the Bunker was that HE had kidnapped that girl.<br/><br/>It made no sense why Howard would show Michelle a picture of a girl who's not his daughter if Emmett was aware of who the kidnapped girl was.<br/><br/>THE MARKETING:<br/><br/>I admit, ""10 CLOVERFIELD LANE"" intrigued me. The idea this is a sort of sequel to CLOVERFIELD got me to buy tickets, but then when Michelle wakes up in the bunker and DOESN'T believe Howard that something's happening outside - it dawned on me - IT'S A SEQUEL TO CLOVERFIELD, so Howard's 100% right.<br/><br/>All the mystery was gone.<br/><br/>by calling it ""cloverfield"" and mentioning in press that it's a sequel, it completely invalidates all the tension of ""if"" something is happening or not.<br/><br/>I think the filmmakers would've been better to name the film ""THE BUNKER"" and then NOT tell people it's a sequel. And then, at the end, when Michelle escapes, you see that mailbox with the address ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" - and let audiences put it together.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm alone, but ultimately this was an unsatisfying experience. I love Goodman and Wanstead. I loved the production design of the bunker. The screenwriters were too focused on plot and not enough on character. Really underusing Emmett and making Wanstead one note were weak decisions. Also, making Goodman good, bad, good and bad just showed they were trying to trick the audience instead of serving the story.<br/><br/>And if I could advise Dan Trachtenberg in the future, you DON'T have to have 90% music running through your film. Silence is sometimes more effective than score to build tension. I felt like this was a musical with wall-to-wall score playing. They're in a bunker. I would've preferred to hear silence, like the characters hear. The weird rumblings from above. The constant hum of the lights or generator or fans."
"zumo-16908","7","3","8","11 March 2016"," A missed opportunity
","I will try keep the spoiler level low, so that this can be read before watching the movie.<br/><br/>This movie delivers solid and captivating psychological drama, with great characters and a unique story. Especially John Goodman delivers an outstanding performance. Overall I really enjoyed the movie, but the last 15 minutes almost ruined it for me to be honest. I would rather if it had ended with the mystery intact instead of turning to banalities. I hope the DVD/Blu-ray will come with an alternative ending, because this movie certainly deserves something better. I do think that this movie is worth watching, but a minute or so after Michelle rips a hole in her pants (you will know when it happens),there is IMO not much reason to watch any more of it. It will feel a bit incomplete perhaps, but its better that way.<br/><br/>I know that some people despise cliffhanger type endings, and I would surely have disliked such and ending when I was a kid, but 10 Cloverfield Lane is a prime example of how bad the alternative can be. It has exactly the kind of silly ending that your marvel-flick-loving friend would come up with in the car home from the theatre, while making the sound effects with his mouth.<br/><br/>** edit ** After writing this review, the ending of the ""original"" script has been revealed, and it sounds exactly like the ending this movie deserves.

"Screen_Blitz","8","3","8","10 March 2016"," Chilling, tension-filled spiritual successor to Cloverfield
","It was 2008 when Matt Reeves and producer J.J Abrams blow audiences away with their found-footage hit 'Cloverfield, a film that reignited the found footage genre. This year, first-time director Dan Trachtenburg brings us a supposed sequel that was kept a secret for quite some time before finally making its way on the media. Embracing on a solid technical scale and a gripping atmosphere, this spiritual successor formulates a whole new direction while concealing a relation with its predecessor. Instead of fostering a cast of characters fighting to survive against on a terrifying, large scale disaster orchestrated by a giant monster the size of Godzilla, this film sizes down on a trio of characters confined one single room. The film stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle, a young woman leaving her home to escape from an ill relationship with her boyfriend. On the road, Michelle is unexpectedly injured in a car accident and thrown off the road. She wakes up in an underground bunker sheltered by an old farm owner Howard (played by John Goodman) and his bearded colleague Emmett (played by John Gallagher Jr.) who vows to protect her from the widespread terror of what he believes is a doomsday event that lies in the outside world. Before too long, Howard's strange behavior leaves her questioning whether she is safe, or has just stepped foot in another bad situation.<br/><br/>This film is not quite everything you may expect from watching the trailer. Unlike the first film, the found footage style is not used as this film takes place primarily inside the bunker. So the setting is designed to give viewers a genuine sense of claustrophobia, and it definitely suites the tone of the story. And with the decent cinematography, sound editing, and the typical J.J Abrams-style visuals setting the picture, viewers are blessed with some well crafted scenes from the start to end. The film progresses through plenty of scenes gleaming with powerful suspense and palpable tension that dares to leave viewers holding their breaths and leaning at the edge of their seats. These scenes embrace such a tense, heart-pounding atmosphere enough to keep viewers engaged with the characters and story. Nearly every scene is unpredictable. From near beginning to end, it becomes a terrifying showcase where you almost frequently have to remind yourself you're not one who is trapped in that confined space. While the pacing is slow at some spots, it builds up to its gripping climax at the end where the story's connection with its predecessor begins to shine a little light. Mary Elizabeth pulls off her role as the main character, but the biggest gem comes from John Goodman playing Howard, a performance so strong, if appropriately terriyfing it keeps the story moving. John Gallagher Jr. is pretty decent here as well. These actors excel at making their characters believable in every sense.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a fantastic spiritual successor to 2008's Cloverfield, and probably one of the best suspense thrillers to be released in a while. This movie is very well shot with sweet cinematography, nicely directed for a first-time filmmaker, and brings grueling suspense to keep viewers at the edge of their seats. It should come to no surprise that there are some notable connections to the original Cloverfield, but I'm not gonna give them away. Overall, even if you haven't seen the 2008 film, this film is still worth an experience."
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","8","3","9","10 March 2016"," One of the most tense and thrilling movies ever!
","Prepare for one hell of an experience when you go to see this movie. <br/><br/>As you probably have heard or read by now, this is not a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield. 10 Cloverfield Lane is its own original story but does have some certain familiar elements. Like Cloverfield, this film really holds back on spectacle. In fact, the spectacle does not really happen until the final act. But what makes 10 Cloverfield Lane its own thing is the psychological thrill and tensions it creates in a small confined space.<br/><br/>Where Cloverfield was shown through a camera lens with the action being based on how the characters react to the destruction and chaos, 10 Cloverfield Lane's action is based how the film's lead Michelle decides on what to strategically do next. And it is though her, we explore the film's compact but yet also big story. From the beginning of the film, it strongly uses tiny visuals to tell this complex, psychological mystery with little clues that requires your eyes's utmost attention. And the more you learn, the more you begin to question whether the interior of the bunker with this seemingly crazy man or the outside world that may have been destroyed by an unknown threat is more dangerous.<br/><br/>Much like how Matt Reeves broke out with the original Cloverfield, the same can be said for Dan Trachtenberg. He carefully builds up tension within scenes that can have no music but makes your heart as background sounds the tiny echoes, ticking clock and to loud rumbles. Trachtenberg has created this very rich but yet claustrophobic world within this bunker that the majority of the film takes place in. Would not be surprised be if Trachtenberg gets offered to work on any future Marvel, DC or Star Wars projects.<br/><br/>But the key to this film's success are its perfect performance by the only three leads. Mary Elizabeth Winstead proves that she should be more recognized by now as she shows that her character Michelle is no damsel in distress. Winstead shows wide combination of intelligence, fear and emotional damage. Much like Matt Damon in The Martian, she proves to be very resourceful throughout the plot. She shows this great arc of her character going from being emotionally vulnerable to a MacGyver survivalist and ultimately ending up as the next Sarah Conner or Ellen Ripley. And the ultimate contrast to that is John Goodman's paranoid and terrifying Howard. This is by fay the most creepy and scary performance I have seen of John Goodman. From his intimidating physicality and creeping, suspicious stare, Goodman perfectly plays this character as someone who forcefully tries to stay in command and has strong trust issues. But Goodman does show there is a hint of a soft side to Howard which makes you wonder if he is telling the truth or not at times. John Gallagher Jr. also serves well as the ally to Michelle and comedic relief. His performance helps you to become greatly attached to his character.<br/><br/>Many may complain that final act will feel tonally inconsistent with the rest of the movie but I felt it was a great payoff to everything that Michelle goes through and helps to complete her arc.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is not Cloverfield 2 and nor should it be. In terms of storytelling, it is a far more superior then the original Cloverfield. And the tension and scary sounds is only enhanced when you see it in Imax. I would recommend seeing this movie sooner rather then later to avoid someone spoiling it."

","Cheated again. Shame on you Mr Abrams, and shame on me for allowing myself to be hoodwinked again. I won't go into the intricacies of the narrative, the performances, etc.; all of that has been elaborated upon by many, many others. I will say this to sum up my feelings on the film with this analogy: The experience was like being invited to a friend's house for an exciting new board game. The friend shows you the game and it's components, explains the rules, and it sounds awesome. And it is, but only until the game draws to a close...it all comes down to the final turn...anyone can win, and it doesn't matter who wins because it has been such a fun experience. But then, your friend suddenly and unexpectedly wins and then he informs you that the whole game was a scam. The game was fixed from the start; no one else playing the game was ever going to win. Your ""friend"" is a manipulative cheater, and you've been had. That is how I felt at the conclusion of this film; not only had my time been lost, but I had been ripped off as well.
I really wish I had played a board game instead of watching this movie."

"TheRedDeath30","6","2","5","4 July 2016"," Warning: Spoilers Abound Here
","There are quite a number of reviews of this movie and just as much talk on social media, so I'm not sure that I can say anything is truly a spoiler about this movie, but I am finding it very hard to share my opinion without discussing the ending, so if you don't want spoilers, read another review.<br/><br/>I really have nothing new to add to the noise, so almost refrained from writing a review, at all, but in my head there is a vast audience of imaginary geeks waiting to hear my opinion of each movie I've seen, so here goes.<br/><br/>85% of this movie is good (not great), then an ending comes along that doesn't so much ruin the movie as much as make you wonder if the whole thing was worth it. <br/><br/>I'll start with the positives, which are mostly the acting. John Goodman is very good in this movie, playing a man who may or may not be completely psychotic. He is, most definitely, a conspiracy theorist who spent years preparing an underground bunker that has now come in handy. He has ""rescued"" a young man and a young woman and is intent to maintain his own rules and order in this underground kingdom of his. Goodman carries this role excellently, wavering between kind-hearted and terrifying and playing both with equal finesse. We are left unsure, as viewers, for most of the movie whether we believe this man has good intentions, or if there is something far darker lurking under the surface. <br/><br/>Winstead, as the young woman who winds up here, in this bunker, after being rescued from an accident. She is able to portray an every-man in this role, making us question our own reactions to the events unfolding. She begins the movie just after making a life- changing decision that ends up having impact on the events that will unfold later. After walking up underground, she goes through a natural array of emotions, at first terrified she begins to accept the situation, but never so much that she gives in to it completely. Always wary of her host, the events unfold from her eyes. She is believable throughout the movie, showing emotion when necessary, but also playing strong and determined.<br/><br/>The events of the movie are tight and riveting. Most of this movie is a suspenseful thriller that keeps the audience on its' toes and engages the viewer throughout as the plot twist and turns. If there is a negative to throw on it, it's only that the movie feels not entirely fresh. It's not necessarily a rehash of any one movie, but nothing feels entirely original. Yes, it's well done, but it's a well done amalgamation of plot devices that we've all seen in horror and thrillers before. Even if I removed the ending of the movie, it's still not a 9 or 10 in my book because there is nothing revolutionary here, other than excellent acting.<br/><br/>Then, we get to the ending. You could say it's a twist, but I think we all saw it coming, right? Whether or not you believed any of the alien conspiracies that Goodman was throwing about, we know the franchise name, we've seen the trailers, we knew that there was ""something"" out there, so that suspense was pretty much ruined. That's fine, in my book. Even knowing that she was going to get out and there was going to be something monstrous, it could have been done better, instead it turns cartoonish.<br/><br/>I had high hopes at first. The first glimpse of the ship and the ensuing chase by the alien creatures pack some scares and continue the tension of the movie. It was promising, then things fall off the rail completely. Am I really to believe that these aliens crossed eons of space and time and conquered an entire planet (or at least country) with spaceships that were so weak they could be destroyed by one molotov cocktail. I mean, I've seen some ""heroic moments"" in sci-fi and horror where the hero conquers the monster with the tools at hand, but this was really stretching the limits of what I was willing to believe.<br/><br/>So after an hour and a half of tension and the constant fear of what was lurking out there, it all wrapped in about five minutes of chase and our heroine, of course, winning. Then we get all INDEPENDENCE DAY and find out that there are pockets of humanity winning this war. Our heroine, who had given up on her life at the beginning has now decided that her ordeal has given her the courage to join the resistance rather than head for safety.<br/><br/>As many have mentioned this movie very much felt like it was written as another film and someone tacked on an alien ending. If internet rumors are to be believed, then this script floated around Hollywood under another name for quite some time before being bought and having the Cloverfield name appended to it. It doesn't matter what Abrams wants you to believe about there being other aliens in this universe. The script was never written to be a Cloverfield sequel and any attachment made is artificial and came secondary.<br/><br/>There was a good movie lurking in her somewhere. Modern Hollywood, unfortunately, doesn't want to put money behind anything that is not a sequel, reboot, remake or adaptation, so what was a promising thriller becomes an artificial sequel to a movie that needed a real sequel five years ago and the end result feels fake and forced."

","So to start off with, this film is amazing and I can't imagine there being a demographic that couldn't enjoy it. You should see it if you haven't because as I just said, it's amazing. <br/><br/>Before the film has even begun you draw assumptions about it based on its name and the previous film relating to that title. Abandon all that as much as you can, this film takes on so many forms and keeps changing direction so as to shake the audience out of those preconceptions and force you to enjoy the film for the fantastically unpredictable beast that it is. At one point it seems to be a hostage film, then horror, then briefly a buddy film, then horror again and then ends on a seemingly completely unrelated twist that will have every muscle in your body invested in the conclusion to the story.<br/><br/>Cloverfield was a fairly good alien horror film and an OK film overall, whereas 10 Cloverfield Lane squarely surpasses any ambition and story telling skill displayed by the film it shares a semblance of its name with. This film is superior in every way and is such a roller-coaster ride of ever-changing direction that I fail to think of anything close to what it accomplishes that I could compare it to.<br/><br/>Go. Watch. Enjoy."

I was trying to figure out if I was in a theater or a sports arena rooting for my team at times. The story will keep you guessing, in awe, and confused from start to finish. The story is a weird one and your opinion of the situation will change throughout the movie. The unpredictability is probably the best factor of the movie. This film will make you wanna lean in, be attentive, and sometimes even reach out to grab someone or something. This isn't a movie you want to wait for.

","After getting in a car accident, a woman is held in a shelter with two men. <br/><br/>Director Dan Trachtenberg offers a well directed solid suspense thriller, that borrows from Stephen King's Misery, War of the Worlds and of course Cloverfield in the closing. 10 Cloverfield Lane's minimal main cast are on fantastic form, notable are Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. but it's John Goodman who steals the show and is given more depth than the other characters.<br/><br/>What starts out as a seemingly typical torture kidnap thriller turns into something quite different. With the claustrophobic location of an underground bunker complete with air shafts, which Winstead has to worm her way through, it does have it tense moments. Loyality and trust themes builds the tension throughout thanks to Goodman's questionable character Howard. He gives a stellar performance with Bear McCreary's score adding to the edgy proceedings. With fine effects and some tight writing from Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken and Damien Chazelle it works as a stand alone film as well as a 'side-quel' to J.J Abrams earlier 2008 outing. Clearly the small cast and few locations transparently function to warrant and somewhat set up a big budget third instalment. But don't expect any alien action until the latter half.<br/><br/>It's fast pace, unconventional story telling holds interest and makes it worth while viewing alone. Cloverfield fans will be pleased but those who aren't aware of the Cloverfield link may get more satisfaction from the alien twist ending and Howard's real intentions."

As I feel the end ended with such fashion it should be a followup. <br/><br/>J.J did a good job hiding the identity of Howard making me guess throughout the whole movie whether he was the good guy or not, which was quiet exciting.<br/><br/>All in all, a very watchworthy movie if you like survival stuff and some sci-fi."

","10 Cloverfield Lane tells the story of three people, taking shelter in a bunker, several feet below the ground. After meeting with a minor car accident, Michelle(Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is rescued by a man named, Howard(John Goodman). Michelle wakes up in a bunker, underground. Howard tells her that the world has been decimated by widespread chemicals in the air. He tells her that the bunker is the only place with clean air, & that it's not safe outside. She soon finds another man in the bunker named, Emmett(John Gallagher Jr.). Michelle soon realizes that, something is fishy & Howard may not be telling her the truth. <br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is an outstanding film. Before going for this film, the audience needs to know something. This movie hardly has any connection with Cloverfield(2008), aside from the title. What this movie is, is a superbly crafted suspense thriller. Director Dan Trachtenberg excels in his directorial debut. You just can't predict how this movie is going to end. It keeps you guessing, even after the credits start to roll. The reason this movie is so good, is because it is carried by its three leads. John Goodman is the star of the show, as Howard. You just can't guess the motives of Goodman's gray character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is spectacular as Michelle. Winstead masterfully portrays Michelle's growing anxiety & fear. John Gallagher Jr. is superb as Emmett. Gallagher Jr. provides some much needed comic relief, in the movie. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a must watch, for fans of Cloverfield(2008) & newcomers alike. I promise you won't be disappointed."

","Against the backdrop of the ensuing apocalypse in the Clover-verse story we follow an episode where a girl struggles to escape her confinement by a nut-job who claims to have ""rescued"" her.<br/><br/>As depicted in the trailer, most of the film is shot using a few conventional sets representing the confined space of an underground survival bunker and features just three actors (with the addition of a few radio voices and one face filmed through a glass panel) I might have known that this was going to be film on a budget for a start! This should've just been a made for TV film or an episode in a box-set, but here we have jj Abrams production company's conceit that they can churn out this stuff and ask for box-office monies ($29m at time of writing)<br/><br/>I left the cinema thinking that the film had failed to decide what it was trying to be and I am quite puzzled to see many people singing its praise.all i can say is those people must've sat through one hell of a lot of bad high-grossing movies (maybe those made by Marvel for instance).However despite this film not having destruction porn in every frame it attempted nothing new. thriller? gripping? really!? are you sure it wasn't just Goodmans character acting providing weight to a flimsy story?"

","Well I don't know how to start this review. John Goodman did a great job I guess is one good thing about the movie. This film or movie was more than predictable and honestly would have been a lot more enjoyable if the movie wasn't so desperate to try to scare people which in the long run made it corny for me. John Goodman's character as Howard that was basically the biggest conspiracy theory and passive aggressive guy was nailed really well. And the ridiculousness of the convenient escapes for the main character in her problematic situations was honestly just too much. All in all, this movie made me feel that conspiracy theories just got grabbed and just got slammed in the movie. Better luck next time."
"Dragonsouls","6","2","5","13 March 2016"," Could have been so much better.
","(Some spoilers included)<br/><br/>I went to see 10 Cloverfield Lane after reading a tweet from the great Stephen King, who expressed his love for this film on Twitter. I didn't read any reviews before going because I felt that didn't need to;--after all, the master of horror said he enjoyed it and so it had to be worth the nine bucks right?. Well, after leaving the theater, I was a bit disappointed and wished I would've waited for the rental. If King happened to like the film, it's probably because 10 Cloverfield Lane borrows heavily from Mr. King's own stories, including ""Misery"" and ""The Mist."" <br/><br/>However, unlike those two masterpieces, 10 Cloverfield lane was a bit anti-climatic, because I never cared for any of the characters. And the ending wasn't as ambiguous as I was hoping it would be. I was hoping for an ending like in the movie, ""The Mist,"" a film that I re-watched a dozen times searching for clues that would lead to a definitive answer. 10 Cloverfield Lane gives you no food for thought, and leaves nothing open to interpretation for the viewer's imagination.<br/><br/>On the bright side, most of the film was absolutely thrilling to say the least. John Goodman gives a memorable performance and I found myself liking him and hating him at certain points in the story. The other leads were okay, but lacked urgency in many scenes. The story-telling was brilliant for the most part, doing an excellent job at misdirection, raising many questions, and making me guess a whole lot, but I wouldn't say this story had any major plot twists like you'd get in an M. Night Shyamalan or Hitchcock story.<br/><br/>I expected that the writers of this film were taking a page from greats such as Hitchcock, Serling, Shyamalan, and King, but they only tried to. This film is just short of great, but I find it hard to call it a waste of time. Like I said, I did love the performance by Goodman, and I was intrigued for most of the film;--but only to be let down in the end.<br/><br/>6/10. I enjoyed most of it, but I don't think I'll watch for a 2nd time."

Walter Sobchak is a very underrated actor. He's genuinely creepy and unhinged in this.<br/><br/>May polarise audiences(well maybe those with expectations), but it's pretty solid for the most part.<br/><br/>The end seems a little tacked on, but there are worse things you can do for 90 mins.<br/><br/>...just don't expect Cloverfield, which in itself isn't a bad thing.<br/><br/>7/10"

There are pretty much no memorable lines or scenes. The suspenseful scenes are resolved predictably without anything unexpected.<br/><br/>The final scene where she drives off while listening to the radio is not really compelling and reveals nothing.

","""It's amazing, you people.. You wear helmets when you ride your bikes, you have seat-belts, you have alarm systems to protect your homes. But what do you do when those alarms go off?""<br/><br/>The biggest mistake the creators of this psychological thriller with a bit of SF made, was to give it the title ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". Those who expect a sequel to the excellent movie ""Cloverfield"" (one of the best found footage films for me) will feel they've been cheated on. Those who hope this film has nothing to do with it and assume the chosen title is purely a commercial decision, will ultimately be disappointed. ""10 Cloverfield lane"" is without doubt the most difficult film to write an opinion about, because revealing too much isn't fair to those who still want to see it. I know now that I'm going to store a battery Molotov cocktails in my basement, because seemingly these are the most ridiculous but also most effective defense weapons against ... uh ... lets just say opponents.<br/><br/>So don't keep your hopes up for some nerve-wracking action or a destructive, huge monster that turns a metropolis into ruins. The whole film takes place in a kind of bomb shelter with limited space. It was patiently designed by Howard (John Goodman) who subsequently also provided all the necessary facilities to survive any doomsday scenario he made-up. Howard is a former Marine and has been preparing himself for the end of the world for years already. And that's what Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is told when she regains consciousness in Howard's bunker. The world is ruined after some apocalyptic attack and the air is contaminated. She's chained to the wall, so she's convinced she's being kidnapped. Howard on the other hand, claims that she had a car accident and he took care of her and thus saved her life. After she hears the same story told by Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), another survivor who helped building this bunker, she's back at ease.<br/><br/>What follows is a psychological thriller full of suspicion and doubt. The limited space ensures for an oppressive feeling. It's better people with claustrophobia avoid this film. Constantly you're wondering if it's true about the attack or not. Or is Howard simply a psychopathic madman who came up with this fake story. Repeatedly you're put on the wrong track. So the plausibility of each option always changes. The most praiseworthy part of this film is the acting of John Goodman. Admittedly I think Goodman is one hell of an actor who gives shape to his character in a natural way. Whether he's an unscrupulous loan shark as in ""The Gambler"" or plays an eccentric drug dealer as in ""Flight"". Every time it seems as if Goodman was born for the part. The same is true for this movie. On the one hand Howard seems to be a pleasant chubby man with a somewhat neurotic side which makes him a fatalist. On the other hand there's a veil of secrecy hanging around him and he has a paranoid attitude. It looks as if he has different plans with his guests. In those moments he's terrifying. The growing distrust between the main characters is portrayed in a fantastic way and it's extremely fascinating. <br/><br/>And what was the least commendable in this film? The end. The tension is systematically built up during the first hour and a half, but at one stroke it all disappears and it's replaced by vicarious shame. Not only the ending is filled with nonsensical, idiotic developments, but it feels like they've made this denouement at the last minute out of commercial reasons (something I'm allergic to). Frankly, it looks pitifully poor and the response of Michelle is completely implausible (vague description. I know. But it's necessary since I don't want to reveal anything). Maybe I'm wrong, but I've a sneaking suspicion that the interference of J.J. Abrams caused it. Is that why the film title changed from ""The cellar"" into ""10 Cloverfield lane""? Was there another planned denouement at first? Was it rewritten under the influence of Abrams so that fans of ""Cloverfield"" could be lured to the cinema? I have no idea. But my rating plummeted in less then no time to the same level Howard's bunker was located. Such a shame. No 10 for this one.<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up from after a car crash and finds herself chained up inside some sort of room. Soon she's introduced to Howard (John Goodman) who claims he saved her life. He then explains to here that they're in an underground bunker with a second man (John Gallagher, Jr.) and that they won't be able to leave for several years due to some sort of attack.<br/><br/>10 CLOVERFIELD LANE pretty much came out of nowhere with very little fan fare, which is pretty amazing in today's world where it seems everything is known and discussed years before the actual film is viewed. This semi-sequel to CLOVERFIELD isn't anything like that picture and it's best that you view this film without knowing too much about its plot or everything that happens. With that said, I'm going to avoid going into too many plot details so that I don't give anything away.<br/><br/>Again, if you're expecting something like the original then get that out of your head because this film here is 97% mystery and it's a very impressive one at that. The entire set up takes place in this doomsday bunker but you never really know what's going on. Is Howard really a savior to these two people? If there really was an attack on the outside who was it from? Is Howard really just a creep and nothing happened on the outside? There are a lot of terrific questions asked throughout the picture and the viewer is pretty much as confused as the Michelle character because you really don't know what to believe and there are several twists and turns along the way.<br/><br/>Director Dan Trachtenberg does an extremely impressive job with keeping the viewer guessing throughout the picture. The screenplay is quite intelligent and it's a story that I really respect because in this day and age you simply don't get too many movies that make you think. Usually movies require one big action scene after another but this one here is basically a character study with a terrific mystery wrapped around it. It also helps that both Winstead and Gallagher, Jr. are so good in their parts. Winstead is extremely strong as this character who is constantly thinking about the situation she's in. Then there's Goodman who turns in a masterful performance. He really has a lot to do from acting like the good guy to being rather creepy to making you wonder what's really lurking in his mind. The actor perfectly captures all of these feelings and it's really wonderful how he keeps you constantly watching him and wondering what his motives are.<br/><br/>10 CLOVERFIELD LANE ends in a very impressive fashion but of course I'm not going to tell you what happens. The film works wonderfully well as a mystery and I loved the fact that it wasn't afraid to make you use your imagination as to what's going on."

","￼(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A sequel that has its own life, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a nifty little thriller.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Trapped inside a bunker with strangers, an injured woman must decide which is the safer place for her.<br/><br/>￼JIM'S REVIEW: Less is more, especially when trying to solve a mystery. The fun is in unraveling the clues and following them to their logical conclusion. (It was Colonel Mustard, in the Conservatory, with a Candlestick.) No spoilers here! The less you know about the plot of 10 Cloverfield Lane, the more enjoyment you will have in this classic detective game. <br/><br/>￼With that in mind, I will only expose the set-up. Three characters are hold up in a bunker with the threat of world annihilation above. But is that really the case? Is the evil within or just out of reach? Which haven is the safer choice?<br/><br/>John Goodman plays Howard, the unhinged (or completely sane) master of the house. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Michelle, his guest (or prisoner). It is essentially a two-character drama as tensions mount between them. John Gallagher, Jr., in a smaller role, plays Emmitt, the third party in this match-up. <br/><br/>￼Under Dan Trachtenberg's astute direction, all of the actors are solid. Their give-and-take with the characters pays off convincingly. The film mashes up the sci-fi genre with the mystery quite nicely. The damsel-in distress moments build to a frenzied and taut survival lesson, with some unexpected twists and turns along the way. Credit the creative screenplay by a trio of talented writers, Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken, and Damien Chazelle. Their script wisely stays focused on the personal level between the characters and their apocalyptic dilemmas. The claustrophobic elements are front and center and add to the suspense, as does Stefan Grube's editing. Ramsey Avery's set-piece provides some wonderful insightful touches (and clues) in its home-sweet-home feel. <br/><br/>￼Like all mystery thrillers, the ending will either satisfy you or not, depending on how much you have personally invested in this charade and the believability in the film's narrative. (I was fine with the ending and found it did fulfill my expectations, with a few questions still unanswered, but then I am a stickler for logical sense in my thrillers.) 10 Cloverfield Lane combines all the attributes we require from psychological thrillers, sci-fi films, and horror stories quite efficiently which makes the film creepy fun.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"StevePulaski","10","2","6","11 March 2016"," You are now free to move about the bunker
","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a unique specimen in 2016; here's a film that comes out on the heels of very little marketing buzz, so much so that only a sentence-long plot synopsis was made known to the public, minimalist trailers that, unlike most, do not air before every new release in theaters, and a week of screenings that have had many critics tight-lipped about what the film actually is. When I first heard the film was going to be released, I had to try not to shrug it off and assume it would be a mediocre, loosely connected followup to the 2008 smash hit ""Cloverfield"" that's main goal was quick cash.<br/><br/>However, after the thirty minute mark of the film, I knew I was in for anything but a cash-in, let alone a film that was trying to be a followup or a continuation of the world set forth by the aforementioned film. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" not only takes the series into an alternate direction, but completely revitalizes its formula by creating a Hitchcockian-style mystery that is predicated upon heart-racing tension and immaculate aesthetics that are often so crisp and consuming, you might have to remind yourself that you're not the one trapped in the film.<br/><br/>Being that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is one of those films where, when describing it, there is a vague line between what is spoiler territory and what is part of the basic plot outline. To keep things decidedly simple, the story opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), driving home on a long, secluded road after a fight with her boyfriend, before she is involved in a devastating car accident that sends her flying off the side of the road. She eventually wakes up in an underground bunker and meets Howard (John Goodman), a dedicated survivalist, who rescued her from the wreck and claims that this is the safest place she can be following ""what happened."" <br/><br/>Howard informs her that a devastating attack has taken place outside that has left nearly everyone dead or contaminated with some sort of disease; the size, scale, and cause of the destruction is unknown due to the radio-tower being knocked out. In preparation for an event like this, Howard has taken the precaution of designing this underground bunker like a home, with a shower, toilet, Television set, a full kitchen, and food supplies to last years if rationed. Also in the bunker with them is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.), a friend of Howard's who remembers when he was constructing this bunker. Howard will also not let Michelle nor Emmett look onto the outside world through windows without his permission, leaving the three without any contact beyond the walls of the bunker.<br/><br/>This kind of premise just breeds claustrophobia and fear and ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a masterclass example of such. Using some fascinating cinematographical tricks (employed by Jeff Cutter) that showcase the cramped environment of the bunker, in addition to some beautiful, sweeping long-shots in such a tight space, both Cutter and first-time director Dan Trachtenberg create an environment that startles and mystifies. The trio of screenwriters (Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken, and Damien Chazelle, writer and director of the fantastic ""Whiplash"") are smart to keep us, the audience, just as trapped as the characters in this film. We don't know more than they do and we're put in a position to buy or reject Howard's simultaneously incredulous but believable story of doomsday.<br/><br/>In addition, the sound design in this film is layered and cut-throat, not so much heavy on the jump-scares or the abrupt synthesizers that work for a good jolt, but in terms of adding to such a congested area where every sound is ostensibly amplified to ear-shattering effect. This makes every effect and auditory accoutrement to ""10 Cloverfield Lane""'s beautiful cinematography resonate that much more, and makes for a slowburn, suspense-driven delight.<br/><br/>Finally, let's please talk about John Goodman's career-making performance in the film, as he broods but never settles for empty fear. His gravelly, almost guttural voice makes each syllable that rolls of his tongue feel like a sucker-punch to the jaw, and such a blow lands right on the exterior of Mary Elisabeth Winstead, who is anything but a passive force of abuse in this film. Winstead's strength and power as a leading woman is communicated throughout the film, and she proves to a public that has slept on her despite strong performances in ""Grindhouse: Death Proof"" and ""Smashed"" that she's worthy of recognition. Only more likely to be slept on her is Gallagher, Jr., who does some damn-fine work as well, but sort of finds himself ostracized by the sheer power of both Goodman and Winstead.<br/><br/>Again, I must emphasize the fact that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a proclaimed ""spiritual successor"" and ""blood relative"" to ""Cloverfield"" and not a direct sequel, prequel, or any immediately connected entity. This is probably for the best, as the pulse-pounding effects of ""Cloverfield""'s found footage/shaky camera aesthetic have worn threadbare within the last eight years since the genre's revival. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" goes for something different, more electric, layered, and scary, and the film manages to be one of the best mysteries in recent years."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","6","13 March 2016"," Vastly intriguing, very well-written, very well-acted... but that ending
","This film takes so much pleasure in being exactly what it wants to be, a ""genre film"". From the loud score in many scenes (which works wonders), to the clever way that it follows certain formulas while still managing to be distinct in its own way, there's something so instantly likable about it. It helps that it's very well-written, structurally effective, and the trio of performances and characters are very strong. John Goodman should seriously be in consideration for some end-of-the-year mentions or critic awards. I think the whole thing is just a wonder. It's briskly paced and it's magnificently directed.<br/><br/>Then those last 15 minutes happened. I wonder, had it not been expected to have a connection to Cloverfield, would the writers have gone there? Was that always their intention? Did they name the film what they did because they were pressured? If so, what would the ending have been like? I think it would have been very frustrating had Winstead gone outside, realized that there was no radiation-type thing and that everything was absolutely normal. Many stories and films have done that sort of thing, and it would have been so easy to do that here. I don't have a problem with aliens existing in the film. I just think it's ironic that it's this film, which is spent almost all inside a bunker, that doesn't follow the ""less is more"" approach, something which its sibling film, which was a lot more action-paced, followed. They overdo it with the chase sequences, and they show the aliens way too much. It just felt like a different film. They should have seriously shortened that last sequence. I don't think it ruins the film at all, but does it bring it down a level or two? Possibly, yeah.<br/><br/>I still love the film. I think it turns and twists in ways that are exciting, clever, and just fun, without turning into stupidity. Those last 10 minutes aside, there's not much that I have a problem with. I'm hoping I warm up to its ending with time."
"mirachayapanther","6","2","6","11 March 2016"," Disappointing and misleading
","The original Cloverfield was a good shaky-cam, found footage Kaiju film, almost like an American Godzilla. This, however, didn't live up to the name. I just found out this was originally to be titled 'The Cellar' and really it should have stayed as such. <br/><br/>Going into it with the name leaves many events predictable. There are no direct ties to Cloverfield, and the ending almost feels tacked on. It almost feels as if they had a good suspense-thriller. Then they added elements of Cloverfield in an unrelated location to increase revenue. John Goodman's acting really did improve this movie considerably, though. It wasn't bad, per se, just a let down.<br/><br/>My date and I decided it would have been better watched at home. I think if you have not seen Cloverfield, this would be a better standalone. However, it is still only matinée-worthy at best."
"RLTerry1","9","2","6","10 March 2016"," Exciting and Enigmatic
","Extremely suspenseful and enigmatic! Within minutes of the beginning of the movie, you will be sucked into the twisted and claustrophobic subterranean world at 10 Cloverfield Lane. Not directly connected to Cloverfield (2008), this film quite possibly takes us to a moment concurrent to or just before/after the events in New York City caught on the handicam. Director Dan Trachtenberg and Producer J.J. Abrams work together to shock the audience with a movie that will keep you guessing right up until the end. Brilliantly cast and written, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an excellent old- school feeling horror film that you have got to experience in IMAX. Just when you think you have it figured out, you will immediately begin to second guess yourself. Probably the most brilliant part of the film is the fact that three principle characters can keep your interest and attention the entire time without ever a feeling of boredom or annoyance. From the writing to the cinematography and visual effects, this film is sure to keep you on the tip of your toes.<br/><br/>Following a car accident, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up with an IV in her arm and chained to a wall. With no cell reception and no recollection of what happened, she begins to fear the worst. Upon meeting her capture Howard (John Goodman), she fears for her life. Not buying his story about saving her and keeping her from the hard during the fallout from the attack, Michelle attempts to escape. Failing to overcome Howard, she slowly begins to accept the worst. To her surprise, she is not the only one in Howard's fallout shelter. Michelle meets Emmett (John Gallagher Jr). Thinking that Emmett's injuries are from escaping, she learn that his broken arm is from fighting to get INTO Howard's shelter. With this new revelation, Michelle begins to settle into life with Howard and Emmett. Still, something just isn't right. From car noises to sunshine, Michelle has doubts of the alleged apocalypse and must solve the mysteries, puzzles, and covertly plan her escape.<br/><br/>One of the most intriguing elements of the movie is personally feeling the claustrophobia that the principle cast is experiencing in the movie. That is thanks to the excellent cinematography, production design, and lighting. That additional experiential element is not terribly common in films, even horror cinema. But it was very instrumental in generating the feeling of suspense, anticipation, and intrigue during the movie. Much like Super 8 and in the vein of other J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot productions, the movie begins with a fantastic and blood curdling accident. Just like a roller-coaster, once that car accident hits the screen, the movie will take you up and down thrilling hills on a track that you will struggle to see 10 feet ahead. It's difficult to talk about how the movie keeps you guessing and second guessing yourself without giving away a lot of what makes the movie thrilling. So, you will just have to take my word for it. Like with any good horror/suspense movie, it is necessary to include strategic comedic relief or lighthearted moments. And writers Drew Goddard, Daniel Casey, Matthew Stuecken, and Josh Campbell weave together a brilliant combination of terror and humor to keep the movie alive and dynamic.<br/><br/>John Goodman is absolutely brilliant in the film. Not that he has anything to prove. He is one of those actors who, with the slightest tweak of the face or shift of the eyes, can have you laughing one second and terrified the next. His ability to turn his character's emotion on a dime makes him equally weird/quirky and frightening all at the same time throughout the story. Is he a weird old man who, in his own awkward and bizarre way, is keeping Michelle and Emmett from hard or his is a sadistic serial killer who forms inappropriate intimate bonds with his ""guests""? That is for you to discover in the movie. Both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr were perfect choices for their respective roles as well. Winstead brings that independent spirit and look to the character of Michelle and Gallagher provides the audience with a country boy charm. The ability for an actor to capture the emotion of extreme terror and sell it as a legitimate, believable emotion is tough. Selling that acute and powerful emotion can make or break a horror film–if the director's intent is to make the story as real as possible and not a parody or satire of itself.<br/><br/>You may be wondering how this film is even loosely connected to 2008's Cloverfield. And that connection isn't really made until the end of the third act of the movie. Unfortunately, I cannot go into too much detail without giving away the climactic and over-the-top ending, but I can say that it does a great job of being connected just enough that it can essentially stand on its own but when you think of how it is or could be connected to Cloverfield, then the movie becomes all the more intriguing. Interestingly, the manner in which this installment in the Cloverfield universe was directed and produced, it definitely could begin a franchise with movies that are never directly connected to the previous film or even Super 8, but are taking place at or near the same time, each with it's own respective story.<br/><br/>It isn't often that I watch movies that are best seen in IMAX, but this is definitely one that is best appreciated and experienced in IMAX; however, if you want to take the old-school feel of the movie to a who other level, then you may want to consider watching the movie at a local drive-in. However you choose to watch the film, you are going to definitely enjoy the adventure."
"cghesketh","5","1","2","6 June 2020"," Almost brilliant, but ....
","It starts off very well, and for the most part it's very well played and directed. A tense, psychological thriller about a woman who wakes up after a car crash to find herself in the doomsday bunker of a man who tells her there has been ""an attack"" and the outside world is not safe. Has he saved her from death, or is there a more sinister explanation? Unfortunately, towards the end, after she escapes, the film completely changes genre and the last 15ish minutes become a ludicrous sci-fi alien invasion. Had it ended after she got out, I'd be thinking at least an 8, maybe a 9, out of 10. Sadly the ending completely ruins it."
"evito1","7","1","2","22 November 2019"," Great movie, all the way until the ridiculous ending
","Unfortunately I have to agree with many of the reviewers here: the movie is great and builds up great tension, all the way up until the ridiculous last 10-15 minutes, where the protagonist defeats a bunch of aliens all by herself that probably just destroyed most of humanity. John Goodman does, like always, an amazing job."
"hstanage","7","1","2","26 May 2019"," Excellent thriller
","I really enjoyed this movie. My friend was disappointed that it wasn't a monster movie like the first. I understand that. I tried to point out that despite this, it was an excellent thriller. I do agree that the ending should have been different. Try to watch with an open mind."
"BigYeehaw","7","1","2","15 May 2019"," Just skip the last 10 minutes.
","Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets in a car accident and wakes up in a strange room. This room is part of Howard's (John Goodman) bunker. He tells her that he found the car wreck and took her with him to his bunker. In there with them is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who fought his way into the bunker and now he lives there as well.<br/><br/>And that's about it, 3 people living in bunker, really minimalistic but it works really well! We see things through the perspective of Michelle so we know as much as her. There are a lot of questions that need answering like ""Who are these people?"" and ""Are we really unable to go to the surface?"". A lot of tension is created through the behaviour of Howard, he might seem like a nice guy but you can't help to feel a bit uneasy when he's on screen. So Michelle and Emmett plan to escape.<br/><br/>Until this point, the movie is very good but following their escape, it goes down the drain completely. So Michelle escapes and it turns out that nothing really happened to the earth so Howard just kidnapped them and made up a story so they wouldn't leave. This is where the movie should've ended in my opinion, a great ending! But oh no, it continues.<br/><br/>It ends with Michelle fighting of aliens because they had to spend their 15 million budget on something right? So it ends with her destroying some alien spaceship and driving off into the distance.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie up until the ending so I would suggest just skipping it. It could've been a 9 but I'll just have to give 10 Cloverfield Lane a 7."
"campicon","1","1","2","22 December 2018"," Boring and terrible end
","Just don't. It is a wast of time. Some explanations are missing and the end is Very disapointing."
"Ruxo","6","1","2","22 November 2018"," The movie that's full of doubts until the end..
","If you have read any comments before, you're already spoiled as this movie works best if you know the least (Just know that Cloverfield was destroyed by aliens from the past movie is enough!). Because if you know even a single piece of fact, the rest of movie will become predictable.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* The end of story is really bad. I think better version should've been the protagonist was killed once she escaped and met the alien. This way the movie will end with idea of two choices: Either living with a lunatic(?) in a confined space or escape from it and die. Too bad the movie introduced a third option where the protagonist becomes a super girl and fight with aliens. Very stupid ending, though during first half period have me fun of guessing and pressure. Thus 6/10."
"nomorefog","4","1","2","3 November 2018"," Movies should be about something.
","The first 95 minutes of this movie was pure exposition for the next sequel. The last 5 minutes, was a microcosm of the sequel.
These guys should take a script writing course on how to make a movie about something other than what they plan to make in the future. Or leave the movie business and take their money-making crystal ball with them."
"bhojanipruthvi","7","1","2","28 October 2018"," 80% of the movie was so amazing
","Since the beginning my eyes were stuck on the movie and the mind made a lot of theories about what the story is and how it will end and also the plot kept changing a little which was amazing the way it was written Until...
The end sucked so badly, it totally spoiled the good part of the movie!"
"crimson03","9","1","2","24 October 2018"," Complicated but ultimately worthwhile films
","This is a complicated film to evaluate:<br/><br/>The first 90% of the film is an absolutely brilliant character-driven thriller set in the claustrophobic confines of an emergency bunker and was as sharply acted as a cerebral Broadway play. The tense, complex plot included the ever fluctuating question of Howard's sanity, in stellar performance by John Goodman; the chemistry between the 3 actors is top-notch as their characters' relationships shift and deteriorate; and then the suspenseful, violent semi-finale was ultra compelling. But then there's the controversial final ending:<br/><br/>I agree with other reviews that the sudden alien attack is extremely disjointed, but altogether, I actually think it kind of works. First of all, it turned out that Howard _was_telling the truth, and the world as they knew it was no longer safe. And yet, given how things unfolded in the bunker, it raises the core philosophical theme of the movie: What is worse, the monsters that attack us, or the monsters in ourselves?<br/><br/>Secondly, this also worked as a sequel--the first film was about the initial invasion of the Godzilla-like creature and similar monsters, while this movie was about the full blown invasion.<br/><br/>Also, I actually think the Cloverfield films are refreshingly realistic depictions of what what would happen in such a disaster: Will Smith doesn't zoom in with a fighter jet to save the day, and The Rock won't march us to safety as he punches out everything in his path. As both Cloverfield films depict, people will freak out, turn on each other, make incredibly stupid decisions, but somehow a few survive to fight another day. And each movie shows a distinct perspective: the first Cloverfield movie could be taken as a broad depiction of how the disaster sweeps through millions in the cities, while this second film is an intimate portrait of how people in isolation deal with the same/similar disaster.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this as a strong stand-alone film, as well as the clear standout of the Cloverfield series."
"turleymjennifer","6","1","2","2 September 2018"," Strong start, flops a bit all the end
","While it shows immense promise in the previews and delivers in the first 3/4's it takes a complete U-turn in the ending and completely changes the dynamic.<br/><br/>Even though it ties into the cloverfield movie it feels like it could have been done better. 
It began as such a simple terrifying concept and becomes so complicated and diverse."
"GoldenBlunderbuss","6","1","2","27 August 2018"," An interesting concept that's ruined by the Cloverfield name
","The whole driving point of the film is the suspense of not knowing if John Goodman's character is an overly controlling doomsday nutcase or if he's right to stay inside because of an unspeakable threat outside the doors. The problem, however, is that we know he's right since this is titles as a part of the Cloverfield world - so all suspense is lost before it even really begins. <br/><br/>There are some great ideas in here with some genuinely tense set pieces, but when the overall premise is so flawed it's hard to hold it up to such a standard as the original Cloverfield film."

Now, what is this obsession with presenting aliens as some sort of prehistoric dinosaurs with a big nasty mouth eager to eat you?

","The whole movie was an awesome experience... almost. What ended up slightly ruining it was the ending. Without watching any of the Cloverfield movies, it definitely takes you by surprise. The idea of the ""chemical attack"" being perpetrated by foreign military in of itself was already a super cool concept. Instead... it was aliens, and that left a bad taste in my mouth. It made it almost tacky. Besides the ending, the rest of the film is amazing and would totally watch again."

","This film started out extremely strong, with it's thriller/horror elements pulsing throughout the films many tense moments. The film was even in its downtime conversations, and sometimes terrifying sequences. The film uses the plot of Howard thinking there are aliens beyond the bunker as a good device for how he lies to both the main characters in order to secure them in the bunker. But the film is unfortunately being literal on this, and there really are aliens outside in big ships, flying around the place. What the hell? Then the movie literally becomes Cloverfield and the girl blows up one of the ships. I'm sorely disappointed that this film had to be a part of the Cloverfield Series, even though J.J. Abrams states it isn't. Overall the ending was something I couldn't and still can't get over."
"wiseguy233","6","1","2","20 July 2018"," Good first half than falls off a cliff
","The first half contained mystery. Is Howard a monster who kidnapping Michelle for his own twisted reasons or is he an awkward good guy who is saving her and emmit's life out of human compassion.. It's an engaging question because weirdness does not equate to badness and maybe Howard will end up being a nuanced character, who despite his many pathologies is a good person inside and need some time and trust to show it. The surprise is there a door number 3. He's a nut and he's saving her. i liked the movie up until that point. Then the movie seems to lose interest in itself. The dialogue becomes loose, cheesy and the characters become horror tropes. the end barely makes sense and you get the feeling it's been rewritten 30 times and they desperately want to wrap it all up in something that is semi plausible. I'll watch just about anything with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She can sit at a chair and table eating baked beans and I'm in. She was perfect. John Goodman was effective especially in the first half.. The second I saw Emmit i knew he was DOA. They were trying too hard to make him endearing and lovable and he was the barrier between Howard's and Michelle's alone time that the movie definitely was going to make happen. It's disappointing that a movie with so much promise would fail this hard as it went on. If you're bored and want a thriller slightly better than a B movie there are worse things to watch."

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","2","26 February 2018"," Fairly good attempt at something different
","10 CLOVERFIELD LANE is a bizarre and almost unrelated follow-up to the found footage monster horror hit CLOVERFIELD, which came out back in 2008. It's only at the climax that this film ties in to that one (although in actuality it feels more like SKYLINE) but for the most part it's a claustrophobic thriller set in an underground bunker. That it works at all is down to the presence of the ever-excellent John Goodman, playing it expertly as the survivalist captor hiding a few dark secrets. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is okay as the lead, but remains unsympathetic throughout, and the narrative is a little too slow at times, particularly in the 'happy' middle section. Still, the director ekes out suspense where possible, the guessing games are fun, and there are some nice and nasty twists in store."
"mocaler","6","1","2","8 February 2018"," A clearly tacked on ending lowered the quality
","The main story before and in the bunker was quite good. I did expect some kind of connection to the original Cloverfield movie but not the rushed action sequence of the ending. It would have been better to have some kind of a reveal in the end where maybe something Cloverfield related is seen in the distance like when she looks up and sees living birds, she then sees something in the distance. But we instead get an ending action sequence which seems to have been hurrying tacked onto the the main story. It deflated the quality of the rest of the story. It also uses a technique in the last act with which I am quite bored. The final action scene is in the dark. Too many movies shoot CGI heavy scenes in the dark. I think that it is a cost saving thing. In the case with this movie, it transitions from day to might too quickly, almost like the rest of the movie was already filmed and the final act was tacked on but on a budget. It doesn't totally spoil the movie. It will depend on where the franchise goes since the end scene was basically a cliffhanger."
"bregund","8","1","2","3 September 2017"," John Goodman owns the film
","Over the years, John Goodman has matured into an accomplished actor, and here he hauls out every nuance he's honed during his long career. At turns he is either folksy or terrifying, transforming from one to the other within seconds. The only other actor I can think of who has added this kind of depth and range in his later years would be Michael McKean and his outstanding performance in Better Call Saul.<br/><br/>Unfortunately if we're talking about believable actors and their contribution to a willing suspension of disbelief, Mary Winstead and John Gallagher are just okay; neither one of them is very convincing in their respective roles. Michelle should be terrified and isn't, not even at the very end when she casually kills a giant monster with a molotov cocktail, something every dressmaker instinctively knows how to do. Emmett is a dimwit who isn't enough of a dimwit. Either go full dimwit or not at all, there is no in-between. I couldn't figure out why Howard even let him into the bunker, what purpose does he serve?<br/><br/>The drama is gripping for 75% of the film until it turns into something very different and unexpected, as implied above, the end scene hinting at the now mandatory franchise serialization cliff hanger demanded by the bean-counters at all the major studios so the next film in the series can hook onto it. It's disappointing and pretentious but what are you going to do, it is what it is."

","A woman, Michelle, is involved in a late-night car crash and knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she is a prisoner in a cell. She is in a concrete bunker deep under the farm house of Howard, who claims he saved her from the crash. Moreover, he claims that her being down here is for her own good, as the US has been attacked, using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and the air on the surface is not fit to breath. Michelle is deeply suspicious and thinks this is just a ruse to keep her imprisoned. She looks for ways to escape. She also discovers that there is a third person in the bunker, Emmett. <br/><br/>The movie had heaps of potential. Very intriguing initially - the whole crazed kidnapper vs hiding from WW3/aliens puzzle. Even when the movie went more down one of these paths I was still thinking that this was a bluff and that it really was the other.<br/><br/>However, was it sets off on the chosen path, there is little in the way of twists. Pretty much a linear story with a not-too-shocking revelation towards the end and some standard action scenes.<br/><br/>Just felt very conventional, ultimately, when it could have been something very special."

","Cloverfield was a found footage movie of a monster loose in New York city.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a sideways sequel. The ending ties up with the events of Cloverfield in a sense that this is the same universe and what is happening elsewhere in the USA might have an impact in the character's motives.<br/><br/>However this film has more in common with Room or Misery or The disappearance of Alice Creed.<br/><br/>Howard (John Goodman) lives in a bunker and also inside is young handyman Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) and Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a young woman who we see hurriedly packing up some things and then driving off in her car that collided with a vehicle driven by Howard.<br/><br/>Michelle wakes up on a mattress and chained to a wall. She is confused and frightened. Howard tells her that he saved her life and everyone in the outside world is dead after some kind of attack and the air outside is toxic.<br/><br/>However can Howard be trusted? He has arbitrary rules, he appears volatile, he lacks empathy about Michelle's predicament and sometimes acts more like an abuser.<br/><br/>The film is really a claustrophobic thriller as Michelle and Emmett detect inconsistencies in Howard's story and look to escape, but what sort of world is out there?<br/><br/>An interesting variation of a franchise where they could had just plodded along the found footage alien invasion plot but it will leave sci fi fans unsatisfied, it is not a horror film in the vein of Hostel or Saw and we saw something similar in Room."

","I think we're talking about a movie that's not being a bad movie, it's not a good movie. For reasons that I comment in the spoiler area, I can not say that it is good even having great things. It has a good script, the actors are great, it keeps you outstanding. You are intrigued for a long time of the movie.<br/><br/>I think he has a technically good photo. I do not say the same thing about the camera. But at least it is well carried, has intrigue and manages to keep the viewer thinking that it is true and not.<br/><br/>The actors, all five are great. I've never seen that record of John and it's very good.<br/><br/>For all this I put a five, could have been much better.<br/><br/>Spoiler:Spoiler: There comes a time when you think the woman trying to get in, agrees with John Goodman. But I have also thought for a long time that why they do not ask how he will know that everything has already happened. Nobody wonders why such an obsessive person is not on the radio all the time looking for survivors? The effects are fine until the end. It is the drop I was missing next to the previous doubts. Bugs? They always look bad and this time it was not going to be less, it does not stick to the story. You are surprised when you see the ship, I did not expect it, I thought it was kidnapped, but the bugs have disappointed me. The truth is that when she takes the car is when it seems that something is going to start and ends the movie. Will there be a second part?"
"lesleyharris30","8","1","2","25 November 2016"," A Thrilling, Tense and Intimate Film,
","10 Cloverfield Lane is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. It's a very intimate two hours as the majority of the film takes place within a shed, as a man locks two people up, claiming that there has been a chemical attack. I was kept at the edge of my seat throughout wondering if this man was telling the truth, or if he had kidnapped these two.<br/><br/>I did find the ending disappointing, a big finale was building up from the moment Michelle enters that shed, and then it all wraps up in a way that I found very underwhelming, I was anticipating more and it is the reason I am giving this an eight instead of a nine. <br/><br/>The cast is fantastic, consisting of mainly only three people. John Gallgher Jr. was well able to deliver both comedic and dramatic moments, while Mary Elizabeth Winstead shines in a very mysterious, intriguing role. However, the highlight has to be John Goodman, who is absolutely terrifying as Howard, a character who clearly has ulterior motives that he refuses to reveal, I have always been a fan of Goodman as an actor, but never knew he could do threatening so well. <br/><br/>It takes as much advantage as it possibly can with its tight, intimate space, creating an atmosphere that is always tense. Thrilling and unique, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama or thriller. <br/><br/>Following a car accident, a young girl is trapped beneath a man's shed, who claims he is protecting her from a chemical attack, she is determined to discover the truth. <br/><br/>Best Performance: John Goodman"
"kurppanoori","9","1","2","22 October 2016"," An amazing movie, don't believe the 1/10 votes!
","First I just want to say, don't believe the low ratings, because people just voted zero, when it turned out this is not Cloverfield 2, a scifi movie from 2008. 10 Cloverfield Lane is nothing like it, and it's a good thing it isn't.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is (like Cloverfield) produced by J. J. Abrams and directed by Dan Trachtenberg. In the main roles we see John Goodman, who's pretty sure a familiar face to many, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, which I recognized from Die Hards as Lucy, and a bit less known John Gallagher Jr.<br/><br/>The movie tells about the triple's survival in the doomsday prepper's bunker, but that's pretty much all I want to say about the story. The whole movie is based on that you know nothing about it before-hand. It can seem a bit of a gamble, but trust me on this one - it won't let you down.<br/><br/>The movie is simply brilliant. I like the direction and the shaky hand- held camera of Cloverfield is replaced with tripod scenes, which is good. The use of the camera is amazing, and is one the main elements with which they achieved the claustrophobic and exciting atmosphere of the movie.<br/><br/>The story is very thrilling and I watched most of the movie not even leaning back, almost literally hanging on the edge of my seat. The story is very unpredictable and to the last minute you are going to rethink whether you are right, or not. The characters are done and portrayed so well, you change your own opinion back and forth all the time.<br/><br/>The acting is also great, especially John Goodman does an awesome job as the doomsday prepper and the character is very interesting. Mary Winstead's character is also good, but mostly I liked the actress' job, as it was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>I don't really find that much to complain about, and this is one those movies, that when coming closer to the end, you just think to yourself ""no, don't end ever."" It's exciting, with few even scary scenes, and just simply amazing movie to watch. Even though like 80% of the setting is in underground bunker, it doesn't stop or slow down even for once. The pacing is just a notch on, perfect.<br/><br/>I rate it 4,5/5 (or 9/10) - simply because I don't want to raise it among the ""best movies in the world"". Though it was great, you can always improved that one bit more. But, I assure this won't be a disappointment, just as long as you don't go in expecting a Cloverfield- like alien movie with constant explosions and special effects, because this one ain't like that.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading, and be sure to check more reviews at http://radioaktiivistajatetta-en.blogspot.com"

","I absolutely enjoyed this one. As a person who has seen many thrillers/horrors I found 10 Cloverfield Lane refreshing and surprising. It tells the story of a young girl who gets in a car accident after fighting with her fiancÃ©. when she wakes up she finds herself locked up in a man's underground shelter, a man who later on claims the world outside is no longer what it was. during the movie, which most of it is set in one location, the viewer experiences the emotions and thoughts of the main character, collecting information with her and tried to understand what the truth really is. the main actors are great and the directing is also wonderful. it keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let you get to one conclusion. i can understand why people didn't like the ending, since it felt like it came out of nowhere, not really adjusted to the films genre. but personally, i thought it was mind blowing. if you like mystery and are open minded, watch this."

There are definitely clues, I will say that. As weird and uncomfortable as the bunker situation was, I kept finding myself wanting to scream ""JUST STAY IN THE BUNKER!""

","What has happened to cinema in 2016? Disappointment after disappointment. It's like Hollywood just doesn't understand what entertains people these days. We don't want two and a half hour sermons about how much it sucks to be a superhero. Thank goodness for 10 Cloverfield Lane. . .<br/><br/>It's nice to be surprised. Like most people, I had no idea this film was even being made, until a few weeks before its release, and it's a damn fine roller-coaster ride of a movie too. <br/><br/>Most of 10 Cloverfield take place in an underground bunker, but the majority of its running time down there is more intense and edge-of-the- seat than Michael Bay/Zak Snyder destroying a hundred cities. A sharp script goes a long way, and is helped by wonderful performances. John Goodman is solid as ever, but it's Mary Elizabeth Winstead's show, and she's brilliant. Vulnerable, yet resourceful, kidnapped, yet refusing to be a victim.<br/><br/>Some people complain about the ending, but it is consistent with the tone of the movie, where the rug is always being pulled from under the characters' feet. It's only fitting that the pay-off would be, ahem, 'out of this world'. Imagine if it had turned out to be a reality TV show prank or something, then you'd have something to really complain about."

If the ending didn't include that 1 thing, or if it did but was done better in a not so ""i'm a blockbuster"" sort of way, I would have loved it. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, while watching this movie there are several surprises and moments that jump out at you.

This film came out of nowhere, I had no idea it had even been announced before it was already out in cinemas. I'd recommend not even watching a trailer before going into this one.

"mvpeter24","9","1","2","28 August 2016"," Bad Robot takes a thriller movie and tries to market it as a ""Cloverfield"" sequel... strange but good
","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" has one shot that references its prequel. That shot is 2 seconds of a street sign. The street is called ""Cloverfield Lane."" That's it. Suffice to say, those hoping that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a movie that answers all the lingering questions from ""Cloverfield"" are woefully misguided.<br/><br/>""Cloverfield"" is a great movie. It's a found footage perspective on an alien monster that destroys New York City. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" drops the found footage thing... and the monster thing as well. Instead, this movie follows a woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who gets in a car accident and wakes up chained to a wall in a doomsday bunker. A mysterious man named Howard (John Goodman) tells her that there has been an attack on the USA and they must stay underground to survive. A younger man, Emmett, (John Gallagher, Jr.) complicates the interpersonal dynamic within the bunker. As time passes, questions arise about all the characters' past lives and what, in fact, is going on outside. Has there been an attack at all, or is Howard holding two people in a cell to live out some sick fantasy he has? The tagline ""Monsters come in many forms"" is perfect for this movie, because its antagonist is not a 100ft tall monster, it's just a man.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this marketing move is genius or stupid... this is a 15 million dollar movie with almost no effects that made more than 100 million dollars. It achieved this by riding on the coattails of a popular movie from a decade ago. If this movie was called ""The Cellar"" (the script's original title) certainly fewer people would have seen it. The good news is people went out and saw a good movie. The bad news is that Bad Robot will probably try to follow up this movie with an out-of-place sequel. At the worst, we end up with a Cloverfield Cinematic Universe. With the name Cloverfield attached to this film, we can also throw any Oscar hopes out the window, as the Academy probably isn't going to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Enough with marketing- what makes 10 Cloverfield Lane so good? Well, for starters, the entire movie is tense. Michelle knows nothing when she wakes up from the accident, and neither does the viewer. As Michelle pieces together clues and figures out what is going on in the bunker, the viewer is sleuthing with her every step of the way. The characters in the movie are all smart, and it's fascinating to watch the mind games they play with each other as the mystery unfolds. Nobody, including the viewer, knows who to trust.<br/><br/>All the action in the movie is very well set up and executed. Throughout the movie, the purpose of seemingly every item in this small bunker is established to the viewer. When our three characters have an inevitable physical fight, they use their surroundings in very savvy ways that are satisfying to watch.<br/><br/>Other than that, the dialogue is written very well. There is a memorable personal scene between Michelle and Emmett in which they talk about their past and their regrets ""pre-apocalypse."" These characters feel human and are fleshed out by the stories they tell.<br/><br/>The score is also haunting and the sets are well made and fit with the movie very well. The acting is great from all parties, particularly Goodman, who gives a great performance while the viewer tries to understand his character.<br/><br/>Even with the odd marketing, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a must see. It is tense and very well-made from top to bottom. Marketing aside, watch this movie, even if you didn't like Cloverfield."

","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is 15 minutes of big-budget Hollywood sci-fi awkwardly tacked on to 90 minutes of claustrophobic psychological thriller. The end result is a film that kept me pretty engaged for the majority of its running time, only to end by leaving me pretty disappointed and feeling like I'd been duped into sitting through nothing but an excuse to make a sequel.<br/><br/>John Goodman gives a fantastic performance as a survivalist who may or may not be a lunatic and who's keeping a young woman (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) sort of held captive in his bunker for motives that may or may not be admirable. As you might have guessed, there's a whole lot of ambiguity at the center of the film. We don't know exactly what's happening or why; we don't know who can be trusted and who can't. And both the fun and the tension in the film come from seeing plot points tick into place, sometimes clarifying things for us, other times confusing us even more. But this is a movie that suffers from a severe case of ""we don't know how to end this,"" and it goes off the rails in a bad way in its last 15 minutes. Goodman's character turns into a laughably hokey monster when up to that point in the movie he's been anything but, and a series of actions carried out by our heroine stretch our credibility past its breaking point. I didn't have a problem with the big reveal at the film's climax, but the movie should have ended with it instead of continuing on long past the point when the novelty of the film's twist wears off.<br/><br/>Not a total loss by any means, but definitely leaves the taste of misfire in the viewer's mouth.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","Hollywood's latest doe-eyed 'it' girl with the perfect hip to waist ratio, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, brings a little sumpin'sumpin' to the role of distressed damsel. Even if you want to take your eyes off of her, the movie doesn't let you. It's sort of a mix of 'Room', 'Die Hard' and '2 Guys, A Girl & A Pizza Parlour'. Except '2 Guys' was probably scarier. Winstead's character squirms, limps and leaps her way through the movie. It's fun but Goodman and Winstead are given little to work with in a predictable script. To see Winstead at her best watch 'Faults' or 'Smashed'. If you're a Goodman or Winstead fan, this is worth a look see."

I will say John Goodman is in it. And he is as amazing as ever. I will say that if you've seen Cloverfield, and you're expecting a similar film. Then you will be surprised. My recommendation is to cosy up with some nibbles. Switch the lights off. And watch this. Don't sit reading anything more about it. Just get into it, and enjoy the ride."

"jallen-67976","8","1","2","16 August 2016"," Engagingly intimate and tension packed film
","When the film started I was afraid it was going to be another ""lifetime movie"" escape plot and when the Sci-Fi aspects were introduced I started doubting it even more but this film highly exceeded my expectations.It was engaging from start to (almost) finish and every time you think you have a grasp of the direction of the film it takes another turn. The characters were well acted and and provided enough background without distracting from the plot. It takes place in a small underground bunker with only three main cast members making it extremely intense and at points horrifying. Michelle is strong protagonist and though she is a bit too resourceful at points she is believable and smart she dose not try to escape with out a plan and even when she doubts Howards theory's and intentions she is not naive and pays attentions to the signs. Over all the film was soo well balanced and acted that I couldn't put it into a singular category. I highly recommend this film as it gives a new life to the Sci-Fi post apocalyptic film world that focuses on the people and well developed characters rather than overblown special effects and cheap action scenes. This brings me to my only problem with the film the ending. I though they were smart to make Howard's fantastical story's a reality my emotions tended to mirror those of the protagonist on weather I should trust him or either he was insane or both but either way I wanted out. The battle scene with the aliens was beyond my suspension of disbelief and wasn't needed.If she had simply saw the aliens set off a distraction and was able to escape in the car where she hears the radio announcement it would have stayed true to the atmosphere previous established by the movie without smacking the viewer in the face with the twist at the end. Other than that well worth watching."
"midas-jacobs","9","1","2","5 August 2016"," A good movie that has no need of carrying the name ""Cloverfield"", because it stands fine on its one
","In ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" we meet Michelle. She get's involved into a car accident, but when she wakes up, she is not in her car or in an hospital, she now is in a bunker. Here there are two guys, one of whom is the owner of the bunker, who claimes that the air outside is not breathable anymore. Now she has to find out if it is true, or that the man is just insane...<br/><br/>This is the directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. And hats of to him. He was a really good director. You may think that the movie would become boring after a while, due to the movie being set underground for a very big part, but Dan Trachtenberg made sure it didn't. He used different shots to keep you interested and he also took different directions each time. When there was dialogue you could be sure that you would see an alternation of different shots. This was done good, and kept you from getting bored. He is also a very good visual director. Lot's of the shots looked very nice. Especially the outside shots, here he had more room to work with and he used it, to accentuate that she now was outside and not in a small space anymore. That's why there were also a lot of close-ups in the scenes inside the bunker, to show the claustrophobia. This I found clever. The cinematography was done very good too which only complimented the directing. The cinematographer of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was Jeff Cuttr. The soundtrack was also very well chosen. The soundtrack made the intense scenes only more intense and the faster editing also helped with this. The songs where people in sang were also very good. The make-up design was surprisingly good. I say surprisingly, because I thought that this was going to be a low budget film. The wounds looked realistic and were not nice to look at.<br/><br/>The acting was very good. The cast was small, but filled with good actors. There was one person that surprised me a lot and this was also the main actress of the movie. This is of course Mary Elizabet Winstead, who played Michelle. I only have seen Winstead play bad characters or in movies where she just acted bad, but in this movie it is not the case. This was by far her best performance yet. She did well in the emotional scenes and also in the scenes just based on her facial expressions. She might have been good, but her co-worker overshadowed her. This was John Goodman. He was really good. Grom him I've seen a couple of movies and he was good in all of them, it just seems he is getting better by the years. He was threatening and intimidating. His unpredictable character only made it better. The last person on the list is Emmett. He was the other guy in the bunker. Emmet was played by John Gallagher Jr. He wasn't as special as the previous two, but he nonetheless gave a good performance.<br/><br/>The writing was the problem with this movie. Everything of the script was fine but the ending. The ending was way to abrupt and the tone switch wasn't handled well. The whole movie had an isolated, thrilling feel, but when she got out the tones rapidly changed. The ending was also dumb and kind of predictable. This was my main problem with the movie. The dumb ending. That's why my grade changed from a 9.5 to an 8.5. The dialogue was very well and carefully written, the dialogue fitted with the characters who said them. Which brings me to the next subject, the characters. These where well developed. Each one of them, which is very rare in today's movies. John Goodmans character I found the best. His character was the most interesting and intriguing. He was unpredictable, like I've said, but this was only one more thing to make his character interesting. The character of Mary Elizabeth Winstead was smart also something that you don't see a lot in movies these days, and also very likable. Emmett did undergo a character arc at the end, which was very good and well handled. I think by now you can see my surprise for the bad ending. Everything from the script was done so well and with care and at the end they just gave up or something. A smaller problem that I have with the screenplay is that you are still left with some questions, but I think that they did this intentionally, so you can think about the movie even after you've seen it. This is an acceptable excuse, but for some questions I think they didn't give you enough hints, or evidence. I also have no clue why the movie carries ""Cloverfield"" in the title, because it has nothing to do with that movie at all.<br/><br/>In the end I would say that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was a good movie, one of the better movies I've seen that came out in 2016.

","J.J. Abram's divulges us a thriller this time. Not necessarily manipulative, but we are enticed into this one and it promises us some suspense. After being knocked out in an auto accident, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up shackled in a basement. Not just a basement, but the underground bunker of a dour survivalist named Howard (John Goodman). Consumed with paranoia, this man is sure than the world has been depopulated by a nuclear attack. He has prepared for years for this; and as far has he believes, if the damn Russians aren't responsible, aliens are. Michelle soon finds she is not the only one sharing the bunker. Is Howard a cynical captor or the savior, he professes? This movie really has no connection to Abram's CLOVERFIELD (2008). Although it is a bit unnerving with some surprises. Miss Winstead is outstanding and Goodman is very convincing as the cunning survivalist. There are some scenes of dread, doom and violence. A minimal soundtrack features tunes by Frankie Avalon, the Exciters and Tommy James & The Shondells."

","The best thing that can be said about the 2016 J.J. Abrams-produced, Dan Trachtenberg-directed ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" is that it keeps you guessing. Abrams has described the film as a ""blood relative"" to the 2008 Abrams-produced, Matt Reeves-directed found-footage monster movie ""Cloverfield""; I thought that ""Cloverfield"" was one of the best, and most innovative, monster movies ever made, and I think its found-footage approach helped to give the film a perspective unique to giant monster movies.<br/><br/>Of course, the only things that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" and ""Cloverfield"" really have in common is the shared name ""Cloverfield,"" and the fact that J.J. Abrams served as a producer on both of the films. But unlike its predecessor, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was not the subject of a huge viral marketing campaign, and in fact very little was done for this film in the way of mass promotion beyond simple film trailers and advertisements and some random Internet chatter. This served to actually benefit the film, in that while ""Cloverfield's"" intentions became quite clear (both before the film was released, and during the course of the movie itself), ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was shrouded in almost complete mystery from the get-go.<br/><br/>That's good, not bad.<br/><br/>The best thing that can be said about ""10 Cloverfield Lane,"" a so-called follow-up to ""Cloverfield"" and the second in what appears to be a loosely connected anthology, is that the film keeps you guessing about what it's really about for three-fourths of the entire picture. This film is 104 minutes in length, and yet you don't know what's really going on until around 80 minutes in.<br/><br/>That's also very good, not bad.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is an interesting mix of thriller and post-apocalyptic science fiction and horror. Like in ""Cloverfield,"" the film begins in earnest fashion, opening without a single word of dialogue for about the first four or five minutes. We're introduced to Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who has just left her fiancé following an argument. While driving through the rural back-roads of New Orleans, she gets into a serious car accident when she's distracted by a phone call from her distraught fiancé Ben (voiced by Bradley Cooper, who never actually appears in the film).<br/><br/>She wakes up a time later, handcuffed to a bed in the underground bunker of a paranoid conspiracy theorist and survivalist named Howard (John Goodman). Also there is Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.), the young man who helped Howard to build the bunker on & off over the years. Howard explains he rescued Michelle from the accident and allowed Emmett to stay after he forced his way into the bunker. Howard also explains their situation: the country, if not the rest of the world (he isn't sure, as he makes clear), has fallen under chemical or nuclear attack from forces unknown - it could be the Russians, the North Koreans, or it could be Martians. He just doesn't know, and neither do we. The three are forced to live together in his underground bunker if they are to survive - even as it becomes clear that Howard is not who he appears to be and that there is a lot more going on than he seems to be letting known to them.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is certainly one of the more original sci-fi/thrillers in recent memory. Unlike ""Cloverfield,"" this is a movie that is shot in a third-person narrative, rather than the first film's found-footage hand-held camera style. (At least when watching this film, you won't have to hear people's incessant complaints about the movie inducing vertigo in viewers.) This film is stunningly acted and executed, with John Goodman delivering the most effective performance (and one of his best acting performances ever) of the three leads. John Gallagher, Jr. is also quite sympathetic as Emmett, who is not as dim-witted as he seems and even once had a promising college athletic career ahead of him - but gave it up due to his myopic view of his life and environment. And Mary Elizabeth Winstead - who's no stranger to this genre (""Final Destination 3,"" ""Black Christmas,"" ""The Thing"") - as the film's most significant female presence, is very resourceful and quick to think on her feet, which isn't bad since she explains that she often runs away when things get too tough (like after her argument with Ben). But still, she's no helpless screamer; she'll fight like hell and do anything to survive, which becomes clear as time goes along.<br/><br/>All three form an interesting dynamic that makes up the film's emotional core.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to really talk about this film's last 20 minutes, since that is the biggest surprise of all and what people will probably go to ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" wanting to see the most. The question of whether or not this film has a definitive connection to ""Cloverfield"" - without giving away any spoilers - also cannot be answered in this review. Trust me, I know. I tried asking the same question to friends who had seen the film already, and they told me what I'm telling anyone who reads anything written here. It's that simple. Sorry.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was an excellent exercise in tension, atmosphere, and performances.<br/><br/>I wonder what J.J. Abrams has in store for us next in a few years in the ""Cloverfield"" franchise...<br/><br/>8/10"

","The pitch was promising, with a thriller in huis-clos, a post-apocalyptic scenery and suspicious characters. However the movie wasn't really up to expectations. <br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is really intriguing and breathtaking. You wonder what happened out there and if they will ever be able to live once again on the Earth. All characters are very interesting, with different back-stories on how they ended up in the bunker. After that, the heroin manage to escape the bunker (yeah it is an American movie so she cannot just die), and everything starts to become completely f***ed up. Futuristic-ish aeroplanes, unidentifiable alien creature coming out of nowhere, a pseudo-war of the human against God-knows who, an ending very disappointing. Yeah, the last part of this movie is a bunch of everything that makes a good movie become a real crap, not even the tension built up during the first hour can resist this nonsense in the story and characters. <br/><br/>To sum-up : they should have stopped the movie after one hour..."

","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. I was looking for a movie to pass the time. The description looked good and the trailer kind of got my interest. Unfortunately, I do have to add a spoiler for this to make any sense.<br/><br/>It starts out like any other thriller. Girl on the road at night, gets in accident and is rescued by some weirdo. The usual plot twist. John Goodman plays a survivalist who rescues our unwitting victim, Michelle, (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He is indeed creepy. He is the typical paranoid, doomsday prepper. Then we add to the creepy guy factor with the introduction of Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) as another resident in this crazy house.<br/><br/>The movie drags on a bit until the action kicks in. But it's enough to keep your interest and give you some insight into Howard (John Goodman) which will make more sense towards the end of the movie. Up until the end this is your classic thriller/horror movie. The ending is not something you would expect. It was certainly something I did not anticipate.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 5, only because of the way the movie drags on some.

","I'm giving this five because I've averaged out my score for the first part of the film with the second (10 and 0). The majority of this movie is tense, atmospheric, scary and brilliant. The main character has a car crash and wakes up chained up in a cellar. She's been ""rescued"" from some worldwide disaster by a prepper, who's taken her into his nuclear shelter. Or has he? I genuinely didn't know what to make of this situation, what was truth and what was lies. It's brilliantly done. But just as I was thinking this was the cleverest film I'd seen for ages, we got to the end. No spoilers, but I think this film got mistakenly spliced onto the ending of another. Such an original premise; such a great, intense little movie ruined. Anyway, watch this film for the first three quarters. It's worth it."

Are they acclimating to the new world, or plotting to overthrow him? What is really happening outside.<br/><br/>I can't say more, without revealing too much info. The director does a fine job of pulling this together, but biggest kudos go to the Casting director because the chemistry between the 3 main stars is just dead on fantastic. I recommend seeking out more movies with Ms Winstead, who did an excellent job portraying a fighting woman with a lot of guts.<br/><br/>In the end, you may find yourself thinking of various movies, which makes this a unique new type film that I think will inspire similar types based off existing themes. <br/><br/>Strap yourself in and take a trip to 10 Cloverfield Lane.

","I love John Goodman. I just watched Trumbo and thought his character piece was delightful. He can play those wacky, threatening, but endearing characters. Here, he is an unbalanced villain whose villainy trumps the real threat (whatever that is). I saw Cloverfield a few weeks ago and it certainly filled in some pieces, but whether you have seen it or not, it is worth the effort to watch Goodman explain to his two captives why they are so lucky to have this nut case looking after them. He has built a bunker, and an unfortunate young man and woman, who are clueless as to why they are there, become his ""children"" (sort of). Since they see early on that this guy is crazy, they realize they had better try to escape. Like the deranged father he is, he ""punishes"" them when they disobey. What is not stated until the end is what's out there. That's why we hang in there for a couple hours. I dropped my rating because of some pretty contrived stuff at the end (hokey, if you must know), but the acting is very good, and the movie delivers 90 percent of the time. That's pretty good these days."
"griffolyon12","9","1","2","25 June 2016"," An Intense Thrill Ride
","Don't get confused and think that 10 Cloverfield Lane is a sequel to 2008's found footage monster movie, Cloverfield. While both movies have Cloverfield in the title, these really are more like sister stories produced by the same production company.<br/><br/>The movie kicks off with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) getting into a car crash. When she awakes she finds herself in a fallout shelter belonging to survivalist Howard (John Goodman), who claims that there was an attack that left the world outside irradiated. Everything beyond the basic set up is best left to discover on your own, because this movie truly is an edge of your seat popcorn movie.<br/><br/>The whole movie has this sense of paranoia that really oozes off of the screen and infects you as you watch it. Is Howard telling the truth? If there was a cataclysmic attack, who did it? And even if both of these things are true, is Howard an evil man? I remember reading that J.J. Abrams likened these two Cloverfield movies to The Twilight Zone, and 10 Cloverfield Lane does feel very much like a more intense, modernized Twilight Zone episode. There are enough twists and turns here that keep you riveted till the credits roll, with a lot of the credit belonging to the slew of writers and first-time feature director, Dan Trachtenberg. <br/><br/>Almost all of the movie takes place in Howard's fallout shelter, which for a ninety plus minute movie, is a writer and director's nightmare. It would have been very easy for the movie to have grown stale and boring, but the writers and Trachtenberg manage to keep the tension up, and Trachtenberg continues to find interesting camera angles. As well, the movie has occasional fits of humor amidst the darkness to alleviate the tension, which is where having a talent like John Goodman makes the movie work in a way it wouldn't otherwise. John Goodman is better here than I've seen him in years, and that's all I'll say about his performance, cause you need to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>All in all, while I admit this movie may not be for everyone, if you live suspenseful sci-fi movies, this really is a no-brainer must see. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a unique and intense movie that answers just enough to be satisfying, but leaves enough questions hanging to have you theorizing long after the movie is over.<br/><br/>I give 10 Cloverfield Lane a 9 out of 10!"

During Cloverfield the way it was presented was as a found footage film but in this movie it is the complete opposite! Honestly I loved both of these movies. <br/><br/>J.J Abrams even speaks about wanting to see another film mad he said that if they were lucky they could hopefully tie in both the stories together in a third film.

Just like the character, we cannot make up our minds and each new piece of evidence nulls the previous one. <br/><br/>Having not seen Cloverfield (from 2008), I have to admit that I don't know how to feel about the ending. On the one hand, I fell that the alien invasion plot line is actually clever, since that would mean Howard was not just a psychotic madman, but on the other hand, I would've almost preferred a 'conventionnal' ending, making the movie a regular behind-closed-doors thriller.<br/><br/>In any case, the execution is flawless, the tension is here, the doubt is here, 10 Cloverfield Lane is definitely one of the most powerful movies of the first half of 2016."

I imagined there would be only a few hints to the 2008 movie, because that's what the majority of reviews seem to bring up. Then the last 20 minutes happened, and I'm seriously baffled over how people completely dismissed this as proof that it indeed is a sequel to Cloverfield. <br/><br/>""That's not the Cloverfield monster!"" So what, the only logical alien invasion to you is that it has to have only one type of creature roaming around? The first one even had smaller flying creatures, and seeing how that movie was shot in found-footage style, it would make even more sense that we couldn't see everything that was attacking the city. I personally liked that we saw something else in this movie, which now has expanded our knowledge of what the humans are up against, even though I agree that it wasn't as memorable as the monster in the first movie. <br/><br/>Besides this, I also liked everything else about the movie. The acting from everybody was superb, and the interactions between them felt very organic and believable. It was also fun to see a really smart, competent and badass female lead.

","With a perfect cast and a tightly written and well-paced script (thanks to Damien Chazelle), ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" hearkens back to the Hitchcockian thrillers of old, further proving that the mystery box is a marketing tool unlike any other. First-time director Dan Trachtenberg knows what your expectations are, and he uses that knowledge to subvert the genre in new directions. The last 10-15 minutes are the only polarizing moments of the film, but if you go in expecting a typical Bad Robot/J.J. Abrams payoff, then you probably won't be disappointed. I'll only say that it wasn't enough to ruin the movie. All in all, you'll walk away pleasantly surprised and exhilarated."

I would not bother watching the original Cloverfield if you have not already seen it. 10 Cloverfield Lane should be regarded as independent from Cloverfield. <br/><br/>It can be argued that the two movies take place in the same ""universe""; however, the line is too thin to call this one a sequel. <br/><br/>Secondly, it was a great movie overall. It was unpredictable, psychologically thrilling, and uniquely disturbing.

"Quinoa1984","9","2","7","11 March 2016"," I think we're alone now...
","When you think about the towering forces of American character actors - or maybe when character actors just become STARS and household names - I sometimes wonder if John Goodman is someone who not necessarily gets overlooked but he isn't the one you jump to right away. Here is a man who has been in so many modern American films that can be called classics/masterpieces, but when he shows up in something that might be, you know, not quite so much (i.e. Red State) he still brings it a sense of gravitas and makes the character he plays stand out.<br/><br/>This might be an odd way to start a review about 10 Cloverfield Lane, but the primary reasons it works, aside from the strong writing and the surefire direction of newcomer Dan Trachtenberg (expect to see him work for a long time if all goes well), can be seen by Goodman's performance. Howard is someone who takes Michelle (also the wonderful/wide-eyed Mary Elizabeth Winstead) off from the road after an accident into an underground bunker on his farm at the address of the title. Howard admits this was his doing, for her ""safety"" as the air is not breathable above ground and, with only one other survivor (Emmett, played by an unrecognizable-from-The-Newsroom John Gallagher JR), have to stay until the air above and whatever ""else"" is there is clear... which could be years.<br/><br/>Goodman has no other choice than to be a force of nature, a constant threat, someone who can be trusted, not be trusted, looked at as someone who was a father, an ex-Navy man, and... may very well be a psychotic madman. In this scenario the name of the game is suspense and paranoia - the music cues that up as the great Bear McReary does his finest work yet channeling Herrmann - and the screws are constantly tightened on audiences expectations. No matter what we're with Michelle on this, but Howard is this lumbering presence, and I don't mean (simply) Goodman's girth or what have you. Psychologically he's imposing, with a voice that has that edge of ""don't you TRUST me? I *saved* your life!"" This can be sometimes calm, with that great heaping edge of terror, or maybe something else. The ambiguity about the situation is (and isn't) there from the end of the first act onward, but who Howard is remains something to be seen fully until the third. Oh, and sometimes he may dance a little...<br/><br/>Of all things, Cloverfield, the 2008 roller-coaster ride of a monster movie (slightly overrated, in my estimation, but that's just me), is not what I thought of watching this. That film lacked what this had in spades: characterization, real dread and terror, maximum stakes for people who we care about, very few (if any) hasty or stupid decisions (up until arguably the last 10 minutes, which, yes, I'll get to shortly). This reminded me more of another Abrams produced project, Lost. In that, which had many episodes taking place in a bunker setting - and also with a fellow who you couldn't really know what he was up to at first, Benjamin Linus - you had to go from one step to the next, and every moment had mystery and intrigue, but carried along on what human beings are capable of, and what happens when you realize you can't trust someone. And what if is outside is really true? Or not? What is malevolence, or control of one man over a woman or a man over a group?<br/><br/>Trachtenberg and the writers (including Whiplash's Damien Chazelle) have an innate love of storytelling without dialog; there is a fair amount of talking, to be sure, but not a word seems wasted when Howard talks to Michelle, or her to him, or when Michelle and Emmett become closer when Howard isn't around. Everything builds to such an intensity, and pays off with such clever and clear logic - not to mention becoming, for a few real, key moments, as much of a horror film as they can get away with (which is a lot) - that it's sort of a shame the last ten minutes are just... alright. This isn't to say they're bad, far from it, but it's when the sort of 'Cinema Sin's counter started to move a little bit as Michelle gets outside, confronts the actual menace there, and Abrams and company start to (sort of) give the ""audience"" that came to this movie on its name what they were expecting... which it sort of isn't.<br/><br/>This is as much a sequel to Cloverfield as Tarantino made a direct sequel to Django from Corbucci's 1966 film: some of the spirit of dread might be in there somewhere, but one would have to really dig into the kernels of the material to find tangible connections. It's a Twilight Zone episode stretched to feature length, but this is in the best possible way: it's a story that feeds more on what terror anyone can face any day, from the person you know, or think you know, and what danger means in a nightmare scenario like the End of the World. This means it may make those hoping for a monster-mash disappointed, but if you give it a shot you may be paid off by one of the great chamber drama-suspense films in a very long time, with Oscar-worthy performances (no, really)."
"bananaspider","5","2","7","11 March 2016"," What did I just watch here?
","I'll get to the point. Most of the movie was a soap opera taking place in a fallout shelter. The last 10 minutes of the movie was the escape into the creature filled world with one, relatively small, creature on ground and some spacecraft-like flying creatures. Add a couple special effects and done. Wow! That was the movie? I felt deprived at the sudden ending as I thought it was just then about to REALLY get started. At that point I said to myself, man, this must be a three hour movie! I was just starting to get excited. Boy was I wrong and disappointed. Not a mumble of a word, a wow, a whoopee, a clap, nor a whimper of a good time could be heard from anywhere in the theater. Just silence and a feeling of loss for words as to not believing that this is all that was given to them. Sorry, but this definitely could have waited for small screen DVD release. Save you $$."
"swilliky","6","2","7","10 March 2016"," Slow at points but pretty cool by the end!
","I'm a bit torn about how to review this movie. On one hand, certain parts of it were really good and intense. I jumped at moments. On the other hand, the story had some strange beats and became boring in the middle lulling me into complacency and even though it returned with a bang, it still felt like there were some unnecessary parts that could've left more for the ending.<br/><br/>The acting was great between John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher Jr.. Winstead carried the film but this isn't her first time in the driver's seat of a horror movie. She did well in The Thing and did well here as well. Goodman was extra intriguing as a creepy bunker builder. Most of the movie depends on the acting performances and takes place within the confines of the bunker so it's nice that the actors are quality.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

But then things get a little too intense for no real good reason. Almost like they are trying to make an additional point when you already know what's coming.

","10 Cloverfield Lane is a sci-fi mystery film considered to be a ""blood relative"" of the 2008 film Cloverfield. In all honesty, I'm not really sure what to make of what I have just seen. While I enjoyed the suspense and mystery surrounding the plot, the pay-off wasn't really worth the effort.<br/><br/>After surviving a car crash, a young woman named Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up to find herself in a sealed-shut underground bunker owned by a middle-aged man named Howard (John Goodman). Howard tells Michelle there has been a chemical attack and that the rest of the outside world has become uninhabitable as a result. Michelle, believing she is being held captive by Howard, attempts to think of a plan to escape the bunker and see what is really going on outside.<br/><br/>Even though I admired the film's ability to build suspense and a sense of realism, I found the ending somewhat anti-climactic. It's difficult for me to go into too much detail without giving away major spoilers so I'll just say that it left me confused. Both John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead give very good performances. Goodman in particular was very menacing throughout the film. You don't need to have seen the original film to understand what is happening in this one so if you like suspense films, then this film is for you. Unlike the original, this is not a found footage film.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, I rate it 7/10. From a regular film going experience, I rate it 6/10."

"imdb-45","5","1","3","19 December 2016"," Suspenseful but amateurish, illogical and pointless
","This seems like a love it or hate it film because of the reveal and ending, which I won't give away. The entire premise of the movie can be summed up in one sentence. Is the strange man who saves the wounded lady an insane psychopath or is he really the brilliant savant who has saved the lady from an unspeakable disaster?<br/><br/>Unfortunately to me this film felt like it was designed to prolong answering that question for 100 minutes. I was never into Lost or any other of JJ Abrams TV programs but now I understand his forte. It is in telling stories designed to go on interminably with endless reveals. The problem with this one is that the reveals were sometimes illogical, unnatural and forced. There was a noticeable stilted, awkward manner in which each subplot progresses.<br/><br/>One example is a scene with keys. Normally a person who realizes there is a difficult situation abound would wait for an opportune moment that would not invite suspicion. But here a seemingly inopportune time is presented as an opportunity. It's as if Abrams said ""we need a scene with suspense here to prolong the film"" and it succeeds in doing only that.<br/><br/>From my perspective, this film is just an overly long, pointless tease which is apparently Ambrams' trademark. Goodman plays his part as well as can be expected and there are some amusing moments. The actors do what they can with their roles but it's clear they are following a script, sometimes feeling as though this could have been a stage play. While I've seen worse, this has zero replayability factor because it's a one trick pony and all you want to know is where is this story really going. And like many others, I felt that it really wasn't worth the time investment. If you feel that the film is unrealistic and artificial early on, chances are you'll feel the same way throughout."

"emilyjmalbon","2","1","3","3 September 2016"," Cannot understand the rave reviews
","Review contains spoilers. I was excited about watching this film after reading the first few rave reviews on this website. I was expecting a thriller with a subtle nod to its predecessor, Cloverfield. I was left disappointed however, as nothing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is subtle. The film begins by introducing us to Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who seems upset and has had a fight with her boyfriend. That is as much insight into her character as we get. The same can be said about Howard (the nutcase who owns the bunker) and Emmett (a seemingly pointless character who's only purpose was to die towards the end). I started to enjoy the film when it was revealed Howard had seemingly been responsible for the kidnap of a local girl and I was looking forward to finding out more about his dark nature. His character is good and Goodmans acting is spot on. You can't tell if he's right about the outside being poisonous or just crazy. Either way he's creepy and unlikeable, but in a way that's good for the film. The film just didn't really go anywhere though and I felt like his character never got the chance to unravel. Howard was a bad man but we don't find out why or what he did exactly. We don't find out what it is he wants with Michelle. He just presumably dies during Michelle's escape when the bunker explodes and all of a sudden we're abruptly shoved into the middle of an alien horror movie. This is where I lost it. There was no serious suggestion during the previous 1 hour 20 minutes of the film that the earth has been attacked by aliens. It was not even suggested that is what had happened in the original Cloverfield film. However, it turns out that is what has happened and the audience is supposed to just accept it. Michelle single-handly takes on a giant alien space craft with a single Molotov cocktail and wins. Then she drives off to help others and the film ends. The abrupt tradition from psychological thriller to alien horror in the last 15 minutes of the film was just not for me at all. it was a film that forced me to make my own assumptions all the way through because it never really went anywhere or presented any facts, which left me feeling cheated at the end."
"eshwarmail","7","1","3","24 July 2016"," A tense atmospheric thriller supported by able cast is possibly let down by an under-cooked payoff that is not worth the wait
","Did it really happen? Is he good? Is the other guy good? Am I still the same person? Too many questions keep popping up throughout the movie without getting much of the answers for most part. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a talented actress and she seems to have found the right balance between off-beat independent cinema and mega-budget studio offerings and this movie actually is a bit of both. The tense atmosphere, terrific acting by its leads, the suspenseful twists along the way kept me quite engaged until it is all undone by a hasty, under-cooked climax that threw all the good work done so far out the window. <br/><br/>If the rumors are right, a script about an abduction of a girl followed by imprisonment in a basement (aptly titled 'Cellar') has been modified to have a science fiction twist after JJ Abrams production company Bad Robot acquired it. More rumors try to connect it with 2008's independent hit 'Cloverfield' but I couldn't find where the link was. <br/><br/>Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is going through a rough time in her relationship and starts on a road trip alone. She meets with an accident and wakes up in a basement with her legs chained to the wall. Puzzled and scared, she is greeted by Howard (John Goodman) who says that he rescued her from the accident and also the airborne chemical attack that has wiped the population outside. She remains skeptical and when clue after clue unfolds, she understands the true nature of Howard. But is that the only monster she has to fight?<br/><br/>The movie starts with a beautiful soundtrack that loops through the first few voiceless minutes and broken by Michelle's accident which is when the story kicks in. The screenplay toys with the audience by giving the same knowledge what Michelle has and letting us think with her and solve the puzzle. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a terrific performance as the scared and vulnerable girl who is unsure whether to be grateful to her savior or fight her way out from the abductor. Just when Michelle seems to make a little breakthrough, a highly coincidental incident occurs to put her back in place. So the screenplay could have been a little more smarter there. <br/><br/>She is well supported by John Gallagher Jr. playing Emmett who is yet another occupant of the basement and helps her put some thoughts through. They share a warm friendly chemistry especially during the montage when they have to kill the time through board games. But John Goodman's fantastic performance as the temperamental conspiracy nut whose mysterious intentions is what takes the movie to another level. As the screenplay puts clues in strategic places and keeps mounting the suspense, it will only work if there is a huge payoff and there is one - but might not be to the liking of everyone. The genre fusion which is very prevalent these days targeted to reach more audience, might actually be in a little trouble losing out on the actual genre audience. <br/><br/>A tense atmospheric thriller supported by able cast is possibly let down by an under-cooked payoff that is not worth the wait."

","A girl leaves her boyfriend. Of course her sorry boyfriend begs her to come back. It's night on the road as she drives. Suddenly she crashes. She then wakes up with an IV and brace on her knee. The brace is chained to a wall. She freaks out. She's a in a room with some heavy duty steel door. A stranger comes in and offers food. He claims to have saved her, that something is going on outside and that they are save in his underground shelter. He leaves her the key so she can free herself and some crutches. She sharpens the end of the crutch and attacks the guy next time he walks in, but he defends himself and complains bitterly how she treats her even though he saved her life.<br/><br/>She hears some cars above, there's a scuffle. Once she becomes more compliant the guy, Howard, let's her out of the room and introduces her to Emmett who's got a broken arm, result of the scuffle with Howard when he somehow forced his way into the shelter. Little by little they get used to each other while always maintaining suspicion. No one knows what really happened outside. For some reason they have no radio, not sure if that would work in the situation, but they have no clue. Michelle continues to think she's held captive until someone screams and knocks on the entrance begging to be let in. Her face is burned. Michelle is dumb enough to actually try and let this woman in but the woman apparently dies.<br/><br/>Michelle is a fashion designer and at some point decides to make a home-made hazmat suit and gas mask with the help of Emmett. But Howard is also suspicious of these two and knows they are up to something. Emmett doesn't fare well in the ensuing confrontation. In the end Michelle barely makes it out and we learn what is really going on.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a bigger budget minimalist thriller. It's very risky to confine the audience with the few characters in a small space for most of a movie. Usually it turns into an obnoxious movie with a bunch of losers screaming at each other for two hours. This movie fortunately avoids that mistake. Yes, you're stuck with these three for nearly two hours and they sort of try to get along. Howard is a pia. But it makes for some tension, you never know when he is going to flip out or when the other two are going to to something stupid.<br/><br/>It's strange that the filmmakers decided to try and build suspense around the question of what it going on in the outside world, when the title of the movie somehow explains it. I haven't seen the first movie but I know what it is about. Hollywood continues to insist on the role-reversal business for who knows what reason. Michelle is both the brains and the brawl. Emmett is the dumb, useless damsel in distress and the other male is the villain. Also annoying was the beginning of this movie which takes place on mute, no dialogue, nor sound effects just lame orchestrated music and this goes on for a while. I almost gave up on this movie after that. The ending too is just a bit too far-fetched, even for a movie a like this. 10 Cloverfield Lane achieves more or less what it sets out to do, but in the end it is a film with low aspirations."

","While I'm not really sure if this was meant to be a prequel to ""Cloverfield"" , or a sequel in name only, this movie really wasn't what I expected at all. It has a fine cast. John Goodman is a way under rated actor and gives a fine, creepy performance, as well as Mary Elizabeth Winestead. There is one other actor in the entire movie, although I'm not really sure what his name in, but he gives a fine performance as well. As for the content of the movie....well, its kinda dull and boring, and it doesn't really pick up until the last twenty minutes or so, with the three actors spending the entire movie in an underground bunker. This movie really has nothing to do with the first Cloverfield movie, with no aliens in sight or even mentioned until literally the final five minutes of the movie. It also raises several questions that are never answered at all. All in all, I found this disappointing and dull. Skip it unless it really grabs your interest."

","Honestly, ill admit it. I would make a terrible critic due to the fact that any movie I see in the theater, I end up liking 100%. But I can say that although this movie had its flaws. I couldn't remember them for the life of me as I was mesmerized by the performance by John Goodman. The story itself, I liked... I think JJ Abrams did a swell job at keeping nearly the entire story to a thriller and giving the audience more of an emotional feeling than an action packed one like the original Cloverfield 8 years prior. But John Goodman by far is the best actor in this moment. His Oscar worthy job in this movie made him 3 times as great as the the entire rest of the cast combined. Especially because that cast was two other people. Goodman owned this role even in his antagonist position, and I applaud him for it."

","I don't know about the extended Cloverfield mythos and so forth, but sticking three actors in a room and expecting a gripping theatrical movie to result--well, that's ambitious. <br/><br/>So this film deserves massive respect for doing a lot with very little in the way of space, budget, etc. It's a ""stage play on film,"" and as with any narrow-band sci-fi story, you wonder if there will be contrived situations, melodramatic character quirks, and outlandishly convenient coincidences. But if you're willing to be just a tiny bit generous to the filmmakers you will marvel at how adroit it is, and love how much confidence it has in its own believability. <br/><br/>Kudos to John Goodman, who goes enthusiastically over-the-top, making his character a 900-pound gorilla trapped in a phone booth with two squirrels. Good for him. We're going to be staring at this guy for 90 minutes, so don't be boring. He's crazy, but is he CRA- zy?

One jump-scare in particular shocked me (I wont say what it was, but it is at the beginning,) and actually made me scream! How this is a PG13 I have no idea as it is very scary, and very very gory. But it doesn't overdo in the squirm factor. The ending was very abrupt, and it did feel like they were trying to piece two films together.

The biggest mistake on my part was that I almost did not see this movie, so I am constantly reminded of the perks of being a manager at a movie theater when I have some time to kill. Now that i have seen this movie however, I would say it is definitely worth your time and money. Please give the plot a chance if you have not seen CLOVERFIELD the movie, as it will only bring a better sense of what is going on, and is not essential to follow the story.

","I'm not trying to hate on Cloverfield but it didn't stick with me as it did for some people. I watched it once and I remember liking it but I never had the urge to watch it again. When I heard that they had produced the sequel in secret, I was more surprised than anxious to see it. With the good reviews and the big box office gross, I decided to check it out, being impartial going in. I left not just surprised but also completely happy I took the time to see it.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* 10 Cloverfield Lane really jumps right into it with our main character Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) quickly packing up her things and leaving an apartment. We see her leave her keys and a ring on the counter. She drives out to the country and stops to get gas with a yellow truck pulling in behind her. When she gets on the road again she gets a call from her boyfriend Brad (voice of Bradley Cooper) begging her to come back. She tries to ignore the call but she eventually picks up. Before they can really get into it, the same yellow truck tries to pass her and strikes her car, causing her to crash through the guard rail and down a hill.<br/><br/>She wakes up in a dingy room with a mattress on the floor and her leg chained to a pipe. She sustained an injury to that leg and is wearing a brace. A man enters the room with food and Michelle pleads for her life. He barely answers her, gives her the key to her chain and some crutches and leaves. She fashions a weapon out of one of the crutches and when he comes back she attacks him. He puts her down and leaves. Later he comes back and offers an explanation and a threat that if she pulls anymore crap, he will throw her out of the bunker. His name is Howard (John Goodman) and he claims to have saved her life. He says that the end of days (its implied it could have been nuclear war) has happened and that they need to wait out the fallout (the air is full of radiation apparently and it could be years before they go back outside again). She doesn't seem to believe him but he warns her that he isn't kidding around. It's important to know that Howard seems unstable and possibly crazy. He offers to give her a tour and she bumps into the bunker's other resident Emmett (John Gallaghar Jr.).<br/><br/>On the IMDb page for 10 Cloverfield Lane lists the movie as a mystery/drama/horror but I think that I would describe it as a thriller. I say that because it is white-knuckle tense, especially in the middle of the film. You are trapped with these people and you know something is up but the movie plays it in such an excellent way is that you are never sure of anything. Is Howard telling the truth? Is he is as unstable as he looks? What has happened outside? What I thought changed from scene to scene and the fact that I second guessed myself so many times is a sign of how tightly the movie holds its cards. It doesn't spoon feed you when a lesser movie would and I appreciated that.<br/><br/>So I mentioned in the summary that you don't need to be familiar with the first Cloverfield to enjoy this movie. I think that might be the biggest credit to 10 Cloverfield Lane is that it functions so well outside of the original movie, it completely works as it's own thing. I can't be completely sure but the connection to the original movie only comes at the very end (minus the fact that the apocalypse may have happened) and I liked the ending but I really think they could have left it out. I don't want to spoil anything but most of the movie is these 3 people trapped in a bunker together and it is so tense and involving I would have been happy with just that.<br/><br/>With this movie being in such a confined space, it's up to the actors and actresses to keep you interested and to sell the situation. 10 Cloverfield Lane focuses on 3 actors and they are all great. I hadn't seen John Gallagher Jr. in anything else but he was really good here. He gets the least screen time of the 3 but he makes the most of it. I had seen Mary Elizabeth Winstead in stuff here and there but she gives a great leading performance. She helps you get behind her character, she's resourceful and you want her to make it through this. This is due to Winstead's acting job. As great as the other cast members are the best acting comes from John Goodman. I think we can all agree that Goodman is an excellent actor but he's playing against type in 10 Cloverfield Lane. It's through the fact that it is John that you want to believe in Howard but you realize that the movie's tag line that ""monsters come in many forms"" might just apply to him best.<br/><br/>I was completely surprised by 10 Cloverfield Lane. It was slow in the beginning but by the time we hit the halfway point, I was completely invested. The acting is great, the dialogue and the characters were well written and the movie did a lot with a fairly modest scenario. The ending was interesting but I can see why some people weren't happy with it. I could have done without it, it still worked, just not as well as the bottle film that the rest of the movie had been. I think anyone attached to Cloverfield will love this movie and I would recommend it regardless of how you felt about the first one. In fact I'll probably re-watch it soon."

","Howard, played well by John Goodman, rescues Michelle, played perfectly by current scream queen Mary Elizabeth Winstead, from a car crash. He brings her to his underground doomsday bunker where he tells her everyone else is dead due to some unknown nuclear or bio-chemical attack. The only other inhabitant in the bunker is Emmett, played by John Gallagher Jr. from 'The Newsroom', who helped build the bunker and was lucky enough to make it there just before Howard locked it for good. The rest of the movie unfolds while you, Michelle and Emmett try to figure out if Howard is bats*&t crazy or has really saved the day with his bunker. This leads to some well formulated but somewhat predictable encounters and twists with Howard.<br/><br/>It was a fun movie and had some truly creepy and edge of your seat moments. I preferred the psychological thrills as opposed to the straight up scares but both aspects were delivered well if a little by the numbers. Like most horror/thrillers, it's probably best viewed with a large audience and it almost certainly won't be as good on the home screen. I didn't see the original Cloverfield but the word of mouth from my friends at the time of its release was something like 'sucked', and 'the hand-held cameras made me sick.' There's no hand-held footage in this movie so don't let that deter you and it was definitely worth the price of admission. Special shout out to Bear McCreary for the score. For those who don't know, he does the music for 'The Walking Dead', 'Black Sails' and several other recent projects. He's become sort of the new Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>If there's a sequel ... I'm in."

","This is one of those times where a great premise for a film comes along that I wish I came up with, which I say first and foremost because I lot of what I will say about this movie may seem like its not a compliment, which in fact it's quite the opposite, I have said a lot of times that this would be the perfect movie as an independent film, which it is very refreshing to see a movie in the same universe??? Still not really sure how that works as Abrams said he wants to make a Twilight esque type of movie series. What was really great is too see John Goodman acting great in something not made by the Coen's, don't get me wrong I love the Coen's I'm just glad to see someone else giving the dude some love!<br/><br/>The question that I'm wondering is what is this disease because I was definitely under the impression that Goodman had been lying and the bunker was just made because he is crazy, which obviously isn't true, there were obviously many questions as to about the girl before our lead, what the current state of the world is, and many others. Honestly though I'm really impressed that this is just it's own separate universe, and Im excited to see more!<br/><br/>Hayden's score: 8/10"

","I really can't believe that such films actually come out in the cinemas. I really can't understand what kind of people are rating them with anything more than 1. I really can't accept that people with such a lack of imagination actually make a career as script writers. And I really, really can not tolerate that there's a 76 Metascore and a 7,2 rating. It's the ultimate proof that there's something really stinky in this whole film industry.

","The beginning of the movie wasn't too bad, as far as psychological thrillers go. However the main character had very little backstory and needed fleshing out. But the film would've been much better if it had stayed true to the original script that had nothing to do with Cloverfield. The ending was absolutely ridiculous and completely unbelievable compared to the rest of the film. That handmade suit and gas mask worked? Yeah right. If you loved Cloverfield you'll probably not enjoy this as over an hour is completely unrelated, if you hated it you will prefer this but I still wouldn't make the effort. Many things were left unanswered...what happened to Brittany/Megan? Was she told there was an apocalypse too or just confined against her will? Did he ever really have a daughter?"
"Wizard-8","Null","1","4","29 June 2016"," Pretty good... up to the final 10 or so minutes
","When you set the majority of your movie in one basic location, more often than not you have your work cut out for you. So credit needs to go to all the participants who worked on ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" for making the movie very compelling... up to the finale. Before I get to that finale, a few words on the best things about the movie. The acting is very good, particularly by the underrated John Goodman. Goodman and the other actors are fortunate to have roles that are written to be much smarter than usual; even the character that turns out to have a dark background is not stupid - which makes him scarier. And while most of the movie takes place in one basic location, the writers manage surprisingly to unfold new challenges and plot turns on a regular basis. It certainly never gets boring.<br/><br/>The only real misstep of the movie is with the final few minutes. The video store clerk warned me of this ending by telling me that the end was ""weird"", and after watching it I have to agree with her to a degree. It doesn't really fit the down to earth and believable attitude the movie had up to that point. I know with a modern day movie like this that the audience expects some ""big"" twist at the end, but for me it didn't seem right. The business with the Molotov cocktail made things really unbelievable. I guess the movie is still worth seeing, but the misguided ending prevents the movie from being a minor classic and downgrades it to being merely entertaining."
"dankburglar","1","1","4","23 June 2016"," Typical Strong Female lead.
","I knew nothing of this film except that it had one of my favorite actors i it John Goodman. And I must say he did well. But I am sick of these Hollywood plots where there is a male antagonist a female protagonist and a male side cast who sacrifices himself for the female protagonist and of course the Strong Woman gets justice on the Bad Man in the end, Hurray.... I have seen this narrative over and over again and it sickens me. 10 Cloverfield Lane does pretty good for itself script wise for the most part but what ruined the movie for me half way through was the when the fashion (newly single and strong because of it) goes on and on about her Father abuse story Hollywood just keeps kicking these poor men when they are down over 90 percent of child dispute go in favour of women and then you have to go to the theater to here about how abusive men are, disgusting. I just couldn't get past the silly feminist satire especially at the end where the fashion lady became a hero and decides she is going to face the alien threat head on thread and needle be damned!. Who knew Fashion could help save the world! So lame. Do not get me wrong I love fantasy but this movie has strong overtones of feminist jargon. when will we have a truly sacrificial heroine make the silver screen? I do not know. But we will not have it today.<br/><br/>THUMBS DOWN"
"ninjadoge24","2","1","4","18 June 2016"," A rip-off of The Divide minus the gore
","This movie was nothing like the original Cloverfield movie. For most parts it felt like a rip-off of The Divide - with a bunch of people trapped inside a bunker followed by the female protagonist causing everyone else to die either directly or indirectly and then getting out of the bunker to try and face the world on her own. The last 15 minutes were no doubt intense, but did not feel original either. This movie doesn't deserve to have the name ""Cloverfield"" in the title. Replace it with something else and I don't think it will affect the story.<br/><br/>The acting was good. The special effects and the aliens at the end of the movie were good. The suspense at some points was great. There was little to none character build up. The story was clichéd. The ending was greatly clichéd, felt dumb and doesn't leave you wanting for more.<br/><br/>2/10. This movie lacked what the original Cloverfield movie offered. Would recommend watching only if you are new to this genre and haven't seen any other alien/post-apocalyptic sci-fi movies. If you are a fan of the prequel, this movie will leave you disappointed."
"brianberta","8","1","4","9 June 2016"," An incredibly suspenseful film
","A really great tactic for beginner filmmakers to have is to be able to do so much with so little. In ""Buried"" (2010), the entire film was shot in a coffin, and for the most part, one actor was on screen. Despite this, the film turned out to be amazing. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" mostly took place in a bunker, and there were 3 on screen actors for the most part. This film made full use of what it had to work with, and the film we got was a brilliant, tense thriller which had me on the edge of my seat from beginning to end.<br/><br/>After a woman named Michelle wakes up in a bunker, she is told by 2 other men named Howard and Emmett that the world has ended due to a chemical attack, and that they need to stay down there until its safe to go outside again. Howard is the owner of the bunker, and he is the one who saved Michelle from the car accident. Emmett was someone who knew of the bunker Howard made, and he let him go inside it. Emmett also broke his arm while trying to get in. As the days go by, the owner of the bunker, Howard, begins to act unstable, and Michelle realizes that she has to escape at all costs.<br/><br/>Suspense is a great thing for a film to have as it can get someone super engaged in what's going on in the film. This film completely nails it on suspense. The outbursts that Howard undergoes are frightening, and I kept on thinking that he was going to pop in almost every scene with him. Also, one scene was so tense that my whole body tensed up when I watched it in the theaters. I was expecting Howard to pop, and I was on edge as it looked like he came so close to losing it. The scene concluded on something so unexpected that there was a huge sequence of positive reactions I had with it after it ended. That was the shining star for what the movie had to offer in terms of its wide selection of suspense.<br/><br/>However, I think that the biggest reason why the movie works so good in terms of suspense is because of how great the acting performances are. John Goodman (Howard) did the best job by far. He was frightening every time he entered on screen, and he had convincing reactions with his outbursts. Since most of the films suspense was centered around Howard's outbursts, it could have lost a lot of its impact if his performance was played by another actor. However, he was able to carry the movie excellently, and he made the film have a far greater impact than what it normally would've had.<br/><br/>The other actors did a great job as well. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) played a strong, female character. She clearly undergoes a significant change by the time the ending comes along. This is made most clear by the ending. She delivers her lines with effort, and her emotions sound very realistic. John Gallagher Jr. sort of played a neutral character. He tried to assist Michelle, and it showed that he was just trying to get along with Howard. He seemed a bit easy-going, and it was nice to have a calm personality in the movie. The personalities of all 3 of the lead actors vary plentifully.<br/><br/>The biggest complaint people have with this film is its ending. I, too, was a bit letdown when I saw it in the theater. However, after I talked to a few people about it, one person I talked to changed my mind, and he convinced me that it actually compliments the movie pretty well. Just because the aliens aren't seen at any other point in the film doesn't make it any less of an alien invasion movie. The purpose of the final act is to give birth to a standard female hero. After she defeats the alien at the end, it is shown that she becomes this type of character due to her experience overcoming Howard. It's sort of like Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise. This is why she chooses to help fight the aliens instead of traveling to Baton Rogue to be evacuated. This film essentially takes a standard alien invasion plot and tells it in a different way to generate a different kind of film which is not seen that often in today's horror films. Sure, the tone drastically changes, but I still think that it's a really good ending.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I cannot think of anything I disliked about this film. It seemed to hit every note perfectly. I think that ""Cloverfield"" was a pretty good monster film, but this one completely blows it out of the water. Considering how much it entertained me, this has potential to be one of, if not my favorite movie of the year. If you are getting tired of horror films and if you find them to be repetitive, I strongly recommend seeing this one as it is a lot more original than most horror films I've seen. It is the rare case where a sequel is way better than the original."

","I am lost over the hype for this film. It's as though they filmed a movie, and then filmed something else, for what was the last fifteen minutes. What's the twist? There was no twist, but plenty of plot holes. I was really hoping they were going to tie it in with the original somehow. They so didn't. There's your spoiler. No, it's not a sequel. It's not really a movie, more of an exercise in bad decision making--by those with money to burn--I'm not even a JJ hater. This movie did not need to happen. The drama in the bunker is simply a waste if it doesn't tie in with the drama above. Those performances were a waste, too. I am so blown away that this got such good reviews. I think what you are seeing is people grasping to this concept that horror is better when it's not horror. Drama... Ugh.

"austin0731","8","1","4","24 May 2016"," This was a very scary film on the human level
","The follow up to Cloverfield, but personally this is a far superior film to the original Cloverfield movie. It was intense and unsettling, but be warned that this is not exactly the cloverfield sequel that you may expect this is very well a stand alone film. We begin with following this girl who just broke up with her boyfriend and ends up in a car accident, when she wakes up she finds herself in a bunker with a man who claims that he has saved her and that the air outside is toxic and that they are stuck there but the real question is, is there really some thing out there or is he just insane? <br/><br/>Cloverfield lane brings the large scale of the original film to a small human level, which is actually very scary. In some senses this sort of situation is a lot scarier than a big rampaging monster, those moments when you just can't quite get a grip of who's who and what's what. A brilliant thriller and look at the monsters within humans.<br/><br/>The three characters who we basically spend the entire movie with are all great however the best performance is definitely from John Goodman. The movie tagline: ""monsters come in many form"" is very fitting in terms of describing John Goodman's character. His character was one who cared a lot about keeping things the way he wants it and would not take any crap. He constantly poses as a threat that seemed very real which really makes viewers understand the threat, because this guy looks like he could crush your skull with his bare hands. What makes it really scary is how the film toys with you and how you can't really get a grip on what this guy is thinking.<br/><br/>The ending however, I don't quite like the ending of the film. I don't feel like it was necessary and I feel that it kind of just brought the intense action to this over the top monster movie thing which was quite rushed. So that wasn't really a good choice, although I do understand that it is done to have some kind of relation to cloverfield wouldn't it be better if instead of what we got, we get like a scene with the cloverfield monster walking towards the bunker in the background. It's just an idea."
"Bryan_Roderick","8","1","4","21 May 2016"," Wonderful acting, great direction
","10 Cloverfield Lane<br/><br/>I am a fan of John Goodman. From The Big Lebowski, Argo all the way to Speed Racer. Goodman shows that he can go full into a character and make the audience forget that he was Dan Conner in Roseanne. He plays a prepper with almost stereotypical military experience who saves the female main character: Michelle.<br/><br/>Michelle is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead who you might remember from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World or maybe the 2011 rendition of The Thing. She is probably one of my favorite young actresses and is completely underrated as one.<br/><br/>Emmett plays the third wheel to the John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead show. Acted by John Gallagher Jr. and I couldn't put my finger on who he was because of the major beard he had going for this movie. He does an okay but nothing special performance. To see how good he can act, watch a TV show called The Newsroom. <br/><br/>I'd never heard of Dan Trachtenberg until this movie but with JJ Abrams producing his film I could only assume there was faith involved and with almost zero promotion it wanted to go on merit alone and maybe word of mouth. The direction was great, sometimes the lack of music allowed for more suspense actually.<br/><br/>Verdict: Great suspense. Little things matter, pay attention. Dan Trachtenberg has a great road ahead."

","10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense Horror/Thriller that has you guessing the motives of the characters throughout the film. It's the story of a woman who wakes up in a room underground after a car accident and is told by a farmer that he has saved her from the world outside which he says is uninhabitable . The question is , is he lying and does he have an ulterior motive for keeping her captive? This is a spin off from the 2008 film Cloverfield ( which I loved) but it's hard to say why without giving it away. John Goodman is fantastic as Howard and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is pretty convincing too. Director Dan Trachtenberg did a really good job with this considering it was his debut feature.

","A young woman awakes after a car accident in a bunker. The owner is treating her injuries but won't let her out due to contamination. She is not happy with this so tries to break out.<br/><br/>This is a film in two halves. The first is an excellent ""bottle episode"" where John Candy and Mary Winstead endure a dangerous battle of whits, with Gallaghar playing the neutral, swing party.<br/><br/>The sett and camera work really relay the anxiety of being stuck in close quarters. Candy is fantastic as a deranged preper who may just be misunderstood. Winstead is a worthy adversary, vulnerable yet antagonistic. With her wide eyes and body language she effortlessly fills the bunker with a sexuality that heightens the tension. She does this very subtly without the need of nudity or knicker shots - a great performance.<br/><br/>The second half is given away by the titles link to the other Cloverfield. Once on the surface the mood changes to something less measured but with more action. The scenes are dramatic and exciting but feels a bit childish after sitting through an hour of psychological thriller.<br/><br/>I liked both halves of the film in separation but they add nothing too each other. <br/><br/>On the whole, I would definitely recommend this. As a note, unlike Cloverfield - this movie is shaky camera free."

Terrified by her apparent kidnap, she desperately tries to find a way to escape, but she soon realizes that the man who is locking here in the house might actually be telling the truth about what is going on out there. 10 clover field lane is entertaining because you are never too sure about which way the movie will head. You'd like to think that the guy who kidnaps the girl is a psychopath, but then you are made to think he's not, then you think he is, then you think he's not. I guess, you will need to see the movie till the end to know who is evil and who is not in this movie. Not necessarily a must watch movie, but entertaining enough."

With a superb editing to do it justice that is all over its beautiful pace, it keeps you on your toes whilst the excitement lasts.<br/><br/>Dan Trachtenberg's fully-fledged debut is an exceptional dig into a theory that starts off a bud, only to reveal itself into a bigger plot at play. The way it slowly opens in psychosis is similar to a crime flick, and will leave you wondering if that is all to the tale. But no, Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken's story is brimming with enthralling twists strewn all across per se to keep you wondering about the veracity of the storyline. It is just that impossible to see through it.<br/><br/>SPOILERS IN THE FOLLOWING LANE: The most exciting thing about 10 Cloverfield Lane is the way the story picks up. One moment you are wondering it is an abduction, but then suddenly you see an affected zombie-like person smiting at the door. You are forever thinking akin the character Michelle, which further makes the story very tangible. A possibility that reeks of both fantasy and palpability.<br/><br/>Howard played exceptionally well by John Goodman keeps things interesting as it is difficult to get a read on him. One moment things seem ugly, the other fine, and then the perversion returns. You will keep questioning yourself has the world really gone kaput or is that psychotic villain just feeding you bull. That is what the movie thrives on. But the beauty lies in whether or not to believe Howard, a blemished soul with a twisted head, who will do anything to stay indoors and slap judgments.<br/><br/>The only problem with the movie is that it bashes into an unpredictable climax something which the spectators weren't really prepared for. For me it was a welcome twist. But I realized some people got miffed in the theater. For some it was too much to handle.<br/><br/>Then things kind of start sprinting and the movie loses its focus. There is little time for Michelle to grab a breath, which makes her character harder to believe and relate to. If I would have been there I would have shat my pants, or died would be your first thought. But no, Michelle is a ballsy player. When cornered she does everything in her hands, to survive. You could say the aforementioned but then Mary Elizabeth Winstead looked a little out of place to ace those cornered emotions.<br/><br/>Whatever that little put off might have been for you, you have to establish it was certainly a unique concept, a very disparate way of showing it just like the movie Room, with an outrageous stunning plot and a mind-boggling twist in the end. It kept us forever rooted. Isn't that what a good movie is supposed to do?"

Her captor/benefactor, Howard(Goodman), explains to her that America has been attacked by an unknown enemy and that he has saved her life. His bunker has air filters and plenty of stored food for a long stay until after the outside air has cleared enough to leave.

This one's a claustrophobic ride, with a Fantastic Performance by The Ever-Amazing John Goodman. <br/><br/>'10 Cloverfield Lane' Synopsis: After getting in a car accident, a woman is held in a shelter with two men, who claim the outside world is affected by a widespread chemical attack. <br/><br/>'10 Cloverfield Lane' is Sharply Written by Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken & Damien Chazelle. The tense proceedings are expertly written, as you do feel for the lady in trouble. The claustrophobic mood (the film is set in a bunker), is eerie, but suits the film well. What I was particularly impressed by was the flow of the narrative. It slowly warms up & ends on a strong note. Of course, I personally thought the end would be a bit different, but it still works. The Writing is solid, at most parts. Dan Trachtenberg's Direction is marvelous. He has handled the tense as well as the dramatic moments, with flourish. Jeff Cutter's Cinematography creates the claustrophobic mood, most aptly. Stefan Grube's Editing is well-done. Art & Costume Design are first-rate. Graphics are good.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: John Goodman steals '10 Cloverfield Lane'. The Legend is Magnificent in a role, that is perhaps, his scariest till date. We've seen Goodman be intimidating before, but his turn here, is undoubtedly his creepiest to date. Academy, are you hearing? Mary Elizabeth Winstead does very well as the protagonist in trouble, delivering an arresting performance. John Gallagher, Jr. is superb & adds some light moments in the otherwise tense proceedings.<br/><br/>On the whole, '10 Cloverfield Lane' gets most of it right. Its certainly worth a watch!"
"schroeder-gustavo","9","1","4","17 April 2016"," 10 Cloverfield Lane Review
","Dan Trachtenberg's directorial debut is a very good movie. Let's start off with that. However, for people looking to see a Cloverfield sequel or something, this probably isn't the movie for you. I heard this movie was going to be called originally ""The Cellar"" or ""The Bunker"" or something of that sort, but the producers decided nobody would have seen it if it was called that, so they incorporated the Cloverfield name to it and did a few re-shoots in post-production so it could fit into the Cloverfield universe. Sort of. But the movie really has nothing to do with Cloverfield.<br/><br/>So about the movie itself. This is a very claustrophobic, eerie thriller with great direction and performances. John Goodman plays this guy who is keeping this girl played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead captive in his bunker after she's in a car accident and he claims the air outside is unbreathable because there has been a sort of attack. This is the core of the film. The entire time you're wondering ""Is this guy crazy? Or is he right?"" And the movie excels at shaking it up making you think something happened, but then it didn't or maybe it did. Every scene in the movie has a point and it leads somewhere, there really is no filler. Every scene is filled with this tension and is punctuated by Goodman's great performance. The movie is an hour and 43 minutes long, it certainly felt a lot shorter because you're so invested in the story and the characters that you almost forget you're watching a movie. What I loved about Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is that she's always ahead of the audience. She's very smart and everything the movie sets up about her has a payoff, which is great. What she does in the movie is very clever and I loved that about her character. I haven't mentioned the other guy who is in there with them, but he's pretty good as well.<br/><br/>OK so here's the deal with 10 Cloverfield Lane. Everything up until the last 10 minutes or so is absolutely perfect, at least for me. But then (long story short), she escapes and when she does she realizes the air isn't really contaminated. Then she hears something in the distance, she looks and there's clearly an alien ship flying around. She says something like ""Oh, come on,"" Now, if the credits rolled right after that, I s**t you not I would have gotten up in the theater and applauded. But I guess you can't end the movie like that because it would have been too confusing for audiences and you have to have an action scene or something. And this is where the movie falls apart. She starts being chased by this alien dog or whatever and then she is pulled up into the alien ship and she builds a Molotov cocktail at the alien mouth in the ship or whatever and she escapes. I'm pretty sure the entire point of that scene was that you would have at least some action in the movie so audiences got their ""money's worth"" and so you could have the movie in IMAX and make some more bucks. But then the dumbest thing ever happens. She's driving around and hears in the radio there are survivors in Baton Rouge and she can find refuge there. But then they say they could use some help in Houston if you have some sort of medical or military training. Immediately when she hears that she stops the car and coincidentally right in front of her is a sign that says like ""Baton Rouge go straight. Houston go left"". So she goes left of course, but the thing is you do not have to treat your audience like children.<br/><br/>Overall, the ending really disappointed me. But everything else in 10 Cloverfield Lane is great. The acting is pretty good and the directing is great because the movie gives you like clues and you start to put the puzzle pieces together about what is really happening. A solid film.<br/><br/>9.2/10"
"ctowyi","7","1","4","13 April 2016"," I like about 85% of it
","liked about 85% of it. The 10% that didn't sit well is the ending and 5% is the spaces between the emotional beats. But it is still an immensely entertaining movie. <br/><br/>This movie feels like a Twilight Zone TV episode extended to feature length. It is very tightly focused on three principals with a tension that builds ominously. The tension is psychological, not gimmicky. My mind is constantly engaged, pondering what is the truth and which is the lie. The debut director, Dan Trachtenberg has done a superb job of subverting my expectations and tropes all the way through the first two acts. It is the spaces between these beats that didn't quite score with me. <br/><br/>I like this particular problem solving genre in which an ordinary person has to use his/her particular skills to solve problems. That's why I love b-grade lousy movies like Deep Blue Sea and Anaconda. Mary Elizabeth Winstead carries her role well and she is totally convincing as the non-damsel in distress. But the actor that made the whole movie worked is definitely John Goodman. His geniality coupled with his sinisterly behaviour is a potent concoction. It is John Gallagher Jr as the third wheel in the mix that I find weak. His sole purpose is to be a sounding board for Winstead's Michelle and to push the plot forward. <br/><br/>The first two acts is a piece of superb filmmaking. Trachtenberg performed some tricky tonal shifts marvellously. There was suspense, melodrama and comedy intermixed together so well that the seams disappear. Coming into the final act the narrative totally abandons the subtlety and nuanced storytelling and moved into the typical Hollywood bombastic ending. For me, the tonal shift was too seismic to resonate with me emotionally. But I think it will work for most people based on the reviews I see."

","The J.J. Abrams Bad Robot ""Mystery Box"" formula has yielded lots of intriguing and successful films and television shows, perhaps none of them as cultish as 2008's ""Cloverfield,"" which alongside ""Paranormal Activity"" put the found footage genre permanently on the map with this elusive, almost anti-Hollywood alien invasion story.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is totally different. Although it shares DNA with its 8-year-old predecessor, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is shot in the vein of a classic suspense thriller, one even Alfred Hitchcock would admire. There are no gimmicks, just great performances, direction and a dynamite concept.<br/><br/>Genre film actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead (genre in that her filmography is anything but traditional) stars as Michelle, whom we first see fleeing her city apartment and driving off into the country. She gets in a horrible car wreck and wakes up in an underground shelter with a man named Howard (John Goodman) claiming to have saved her life not only from the accident, but also from a massive attack that has left the outside world completely toxic. From there, the film becomes a suspenseful guessing game about the truth. Is Howard an insane man who abducted her, or is he telling the truth?<br/><br/>Director Dan Trachtenberg, who got noticed in a big way when he made an Internet short film in 2011 based on the video game ""Portal,"" shows excellent filmmaking instincts in a story and movie that refuses to (and can't be) pigeon-holed. Novice writers Josh Campbell and Matthew Steucken have conceived and written something rather brilliant (with screenplay help from Oscar-nominee Damien Chazelle) with this idea of ""is the real evil inside or outside the bunker?"" Yet it's Trachtenberg's skill and performances by Winstead and Goodman that make each minute entertaining and exciting.<br/><br/>Much of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" could work as a stage play, that's how tight and focused the drama and story are (except for the parts when it's not, which I can't discuss without spoilers). That's also why pros like Goodman are essential. The psychological mystery has to be as compelling as the larger-scale mystery lurking in the back of the audience's mind for the film to work, and it does. Trachtenberg could just as easily go make a crime drama for his next project as he could a sci-fi horror flick.<br/><br/>Both the narrative and the stunningly cryptic performance of Goodman keep the audience squarely in film's palm. Our minds are yanked in and out of certainty as we madly attempt to guess at the truth, with information coming in the form expertly creepy and often jarring scenes. Oh, and there's plenty of humor too if all that isn't confusing enough. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" precisely proves to be the epitome of the mystery box, and watching it open is a total delight, even through its seemingly box-busted ending.<br/><br/>Not to overuse the analogy, but anyone expecting ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" to fit into any kind of box will be disappointed; those who can appreciate the melange of tones and styles that it so exceptionally encompasses will find themselves entertained in a way only so many films can.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","10 Cloverfield Lane (2016): Dir: Dan Trachtenberg / Cast: John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Gallagher Jr., Suzanne Cryer / Voice: Bradley Cooper: Tense independent science fiction thriller about the question of safety. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Michelle who is fleeing town after leaving her fiancé. She is hit by a truck and awakens in a bunker chained to a wall. John Goodman plays Howard, her captor although he claims that he saved her life. He explains that the air outside is toxic and that extra-terrestrials are attacking. Director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job at placing the audience within Michelle's point of view not knowing whether Howard is crazy or not. Goodman plays Howard as a Navy soldier shell shocked with regards to traumatic experiences and he showcase of affection is countered with bouts of paranoia and aggression. Winstead as Michelle attempts to live within her compounds while planning an escape. A trip through the air ducts leads to further clues as to Howard's sanity. John Gallagher Jr plays Emmet, a naive and injured guy who buys into Howard's logic until Michelle presents alternate clues that call to question. Suzanne Cryer appears briefly as a screaming decaying woman outside the bunker who demands entry. Bradley Cooper provides the voice only to Michelle's pleading fiancé. While not directly related to Cloverfield the climax is exhilarating with Michelle left to face what sanity is clearly evident. She is our point of view as she turns on road to Houston leaving the route to freedom behind and choosing instead to fight for it. Score: 9 ½ / 10"
"quincytheodore","8","1","4","6 April 2016"," A masterful entry in suspense
","There's always a sense of novelty when one walks into the cinema without knowledge of the movie. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" delivers the same vibe as ""District 9"" years ago, combining action thriller, sci-fi and even mystery Stephen King would approve. It's a very different approach than similarly named ""Cloverfield"", but it enhances the experience with much better use of the premise and small yet talented cast.<br/><br/>To divulge the plot, even smallest amount, would be a disservice to the movie. The gist of it is Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) finds herself in a predicament with two other gentlemen Howard (John Goodman) and Emmette (John Gallagher Jr.), as they must band together for common self-preservation goal.<br/><br/>The dilemma is Michelle, as well as the audience, doesn't know the circumstance beyond hearsay or others' accounts, whether it's post apocalypse or something much simpler. It takes the audience on a journey with the characters. Michelle is a resourceful woman and she's constantly trying to figure out who to trust among her new fellow gents, or even none at all.<br/><br/>John Goodman is channeling Kathy Bates in a surreal antagonistic and imposing parental figure, the kind that might be a bit abusive. He has eerie presence, but he carries himself with conviction regardless of the sometimes crazy scenario. Meanwhile John Gallagher Jr. plays as the carefree Emmette who is more creative than he may let on.<br/><br/>This small cast works wonder in tight space, each problem is handled with incredible pace, in fact the flow in this movie is among the finer one in recent thrillers. It has great production, carefully crafted situation and fine use of sound effects. The tension occurs consistently when the threat is hidden or exposed.<br/><br/>For a brilliant violent mix of riveting thriller and sci-fi, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is more than a worthy visit."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","4","6 April 2016"," ""Crazy is building your ark after the flood has already come.""
","The trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane dropped on everyone, 2 months before the film's release. No one knew about it. Everyone went nuts over how this film could have been made, in this day of the internet, and no one know about it? The answer to that is because this film is in no way connected to the original Cloverfield film. Sorry to burst the bubble for those hoping for some kind of sequel, but this film is NOT IT. <br/><br/>Michelle wakes up, chained to a wall, in an underground bunker. Her captor, a man named Howard, informs her that she was just in a car accident and that the world is under some kind of attack. She doesn't believe him and desperately tries to get out...but is the unknown on the outside more safe than what she knows lies within?<br/><br/>The filmmakers have repeatedly stated that this film is not a sequel, nor does it take place in the same universe as the original. So what the hell is it exactly? There seems to be a bit of controversy over how the film came to be. One person says one thing, another says something else. Then you watch the film and you question both answers. Did the studio think they had a really well crafted film on their hands and wanted more people to see it? So they decided to throw the name Cloverfield onto it in the hopes of getting butts in the seats? What we DO know is that the original script, The Cellar, had nothing to do with Cloverfield. It was later crafted to be somewhat similar. Or maybe it wasn't. According to some interviews, they didn't really change anything. After watching the film, some people may find that hard to believe. <br/><br/>So how am I suppose to feel about this film? I'm struggling with that entire dilemma. Whether the last ten minutes or so of the film was tagged on for the Cloverfield vibe, or if it was always there, it does not really belong in this film. It doesn't flow with everything that came before it. Goodman played Howard, a conspiracy theorist who decided to build a bunker for when the world went to the dumps. In his mind, true or not, the world is going to the dumps. He just happened to save a young woman along the way. Goodman's Howard is kind, dangerous, sensitive, crazy, smart and destructive. The man is prepared for anything and everything, but is he right? That's the question that Michelle, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, needs answered and so does the audience. The film has a lot of fun going back and forth with the answer to this. You'll jump back and forth questioning him and his motives and the film is paced perfectly in peeling back the layers of the mystery surrounding the plot. <br/><br/>Winstead is refreshing with her take on Michelle. She's not helpless, despite her situation, she's resourceful. She's not some emotionless bad-ass either, she has many moments of uncertainty and fear. John Gallagher, Jr. plays Emmet, another man inside the bunker. He's there on his own free will, he injured himself trying to get in. This further cements Howard's claims about the outside world. Emmet isn't the smartest person, but Gallagher plays him in an innocent way that makes him instantly likable. Although, it is John Goodman who delivers a stellar performance, maybe the best of his career. His unhinged Howard will make you trust him and fear him within seconds. I can now say that I am officially scared of John Goodman. <br/><br/>90% of this film is off the wall intense. Everything within the bunker is an excellent film. Everything outside the bunker is bunk. I won't spoil anything that happens on the outside, but I honestly believe that it belongs in another film. Regardless of whatever half assed set up they try to pigeonhole in the dialogue. I believe this ending will split the audience, but I simply cannot talk about it any further without divulging information that in all honesty, needs to be kept secret. <br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is at times unsettling and nerve-racking. I looked over to my wife at one moment and she looked terrified. The intense sequences are enough to make you grip your arm chair tight and in a perfect world, John Goodman would be nominated for an award. Sadly, we don't live in a perfect world and that will never happen. So please, see this film and judge it on its own merit. Do not expect or compare it to Cloverfield, you'll be disappointed and expect more anthology type Cloverfield films in the future."

","""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (2016) is a capably written and well performed thriller; it might not be quite worth the high praise it seems to be receiving elsewhere, but I'd still give it an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead actually is terrific actress. She has far more to do here than her one-note heroine in 2011's underrated ""The Thing"" prequel, and she performs beautifully. John Goodman is perfect as a mentally ill, dubious savior. John Gallagher, Jr. does just fine as a good-natured everyman in over his head.<br/><br/>I did think that ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" ran a little long for its content. This could have easily been an especially well executed episode of a one-hour show like ""The Outer Limits"" or ""The Twilight Zone."" It's feature-length format felt a little padded. We don't need the prologue explaining why Winstead's character is traveling. Nor do we need the movie's slowly building character arc for Goodman's ""Howard."" (We know to suspect his stability from the trailer.)<br/><br/>This appears to have very little to do with ""Cloverfield"" (2008)."

","So if you are familiar with the first Cloverfeild (not that it really matters for this well done sequel), The events of both movies seem to be happening at the same time. The fist movie had the alien invaders strike New York, while someone stupidly kept recording, completely unfocused with getting out of there. This movie is far different. It's a sub story about three people who ended up in a bomb shelter when the attack happens.<br/><br/>Michelle is a tough women who had a rough day that just got rougher when she ends up in the bomb shelter of a man named Howard, played by John Goodman, who gives absolutely the best permanence ever, as a conspiracy theorist who ""knew"" the alien attack was going to happen. I would tell you something about the third guy in the shelter, but once John Goodman makes his appearance, he takes center stage and steels the show.<br/><br/>It's one of the more brilliant horror movies made today as well as a creepy psychological thriller, and the perfect way to do a follow up to a movie, and if all that does not interest you, John Goodman was boss in this film, and worth seeing just for that."

Along for the ride is his neighbor Gallagher who helps Winstead try to make sense of the secret and lies and a plan to escape from their surreal existence. Written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle with clever and frequently darkly humorous zeal that incorporates all the paranoia and dread one would expect in an apocalyptic thriller while director Dan Trachtenberg gooses its audience with just enough jeopardy and uncertainty."
"AudioFileZ","8","1","4","26 March 2016"," Mysterious Slow Intensity With A Shockingly Good Ending
","If you're the type who seeks films with a different slant on horror look no further. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a mash-up of different elements of drama, horror, and something else in the end. The film mixes familiar elements to the point of fresh originality.<br/><br/>This film has an excellent dark and claustrophobic feel from the very beginning. The writer never gets in hurry and uses the slow pace to build it's mysteriousness. It turns even darker soon though and it gets you hooked. I'd have to say its a well done slow ride that keeps a palpable edge - creepier and better as it goes. <br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle is perfect as a conflicted person fleeing a relationship at its end. She immediately has your sympathy as you root for her to get out of whatever it is she's trying to escape. Her escape goes in a much worse way as she awakes from an auto accident. Her new predicament is worse as she is ""saved"" by a real ""black belt"" level doomsday prepper, Howard. Howard has loads of the requisite creep factor as portrayed by John Goodman. Just like he's not your average Hollywood star he ain't the run of the mill prepper either. An innocent and a monster are now in a really bad situation and there is that element of hopelessly being stuck between life and death played out in an enigmatic and quite original combination.<br/><br/>Aside from the tone, the small cast, and the terror it's what is unknown that keeps everything off balance and, as a viewer, on full alert as to what's next. The methodical building up doesn't crash in a letdown either. The ending ramps up and takes a nice left turn. This is simply good movie making in my opinion. A creepy and harrowing ride from start to stop."
"alindsay-al","8","1","4","19 March 2016"," A great unique suspense film
","After seeing the trailer for this film I was very interested and I will say that I think this is a great suspenseful film. The premise sees a man rescue a woman after an accident, he takes her to his shelter where he promises to keep her alive. Mary elizabeth winstead plays michelle and she is brilliant in this film. Her character is really easy to root for and your rooting for her throughout the film. John goodman plays howard and he is breathtaking in this film, he is such a complex character and you don't know whether to sympathize with him or be fearful of him. His physical size also really added to his character and his high status. The third character of emmett is a bit less important but he is a nice addition to this bizarre family. The story is good because it truly is plausible that this could happen. You see these three people develop relationships together in a close environment and it really is a tense situation. However, the biggest negative for this film is its ending, no spoilers but it just feels like a different tone and a different film completely in a bad way. The script is great with the drama being drawn out in the best way possible and the humour being a little well placed. The style is good with the intensity being up for most of the film but sometimes the pacing lacks a little bit and there is a little bit of a tone issue. Overall this is a great suspense film that should be seen."

When she wakes up she find she and one other are being held by a man called Howard who is a little strange to say the least. He claims there has been some sort of attack and that they are the only survivors. He has built a bunker over many years in preparation for such an attack and is now arrogant in his belief that he was right all along. However, all is not as it seems and Howard (played exceptionally convincingly by John Goodman in one of his best performances ever) is more than a little scary. I'm not usually a fan of this sort of film but it was less of the horror and more of the thriller. You know a film must to rely on a well written script, and a great group of actors when the main cast numbers three and the scenes are shot in one small space. This film did just that admirably and the hairs raised on the back of my neck more than once as each plot twist fed us just that little more information to keep us interested but not enough to answer all our questions. It will not be for everyone but I was glued to my seat as the film came to an interesting conclusion."

"doofuspoofus","5","1","4","23 March 2016"," Good film Bad sequel
","Okay so for starters if more than half of your audience can't tell if this is a sequel or not to your film than it's already off on the wrong foot. This movie had absolutely nothing to do with the original Cloverfield and that's probably because it originally was called something else and then they decided to say it was a follow up to Cloverfield. Now I'm conflicted because while I enjoy these type of films and I did enjoy the movie in no way was it a good follow up to the original. I think we all can agree the first one was filmed pretty bad and god forbid you had motion sickness and tried to watch the original however it was action packed pretty much from start to finish. You got to see the military fighting the huge monster and the smaller alien creatures were attacking the main characters at times and even infected one of them. Not to mention the fx they did with the statue of liberty's head. It was just intense.<br/><br/>So logic dictates if they did a sequel shouldn't it be even more epic? This movie looked like it would be the first not the sequel. I mean you had a good cast, good story line, and good performances but this movie could very easily have been its own thing as opposed to a sequel. The aliens in the end weren't even the same as the original film and there were no spaceships in the original it was just a good old fashioned creature film in the tradition of Godzilla. I absolutely hate this film as a sequel but if it was its own thing it would have been good to me.<br/><br/>In laymen the original was like The Walking Dead and this film was Fear the Walking Dead. One's awesome and one's pointless."

I understand that, especially a movie that later on incorporates an extra terrestrial attack on the world.<br/><br/>Overall I thought it was an entertaining movie. It DEFINITELY kept me guessing the entire time. What made this movie fall short for me was the completely unrealistic solutions that basically helped Michelle escape the seemingly un-escapable bunker. <br/><br/>Emmet and Michelle just happen to find ALL the tools to craft a makeshift hazmat suite. Also, you're telling me that she thought her shower-curtain, soda bottle, duct tape hazmat suite was going to protect her from the deadly gas and nuclear fallout above them? No way.<br/><br/>Also, I don't know about you, but if I were being slowly abducted by blood-sucking creatures from another planet, I wouldn't be in the right state of mind to concoct a molotov cocktail in 25 seconds and logically figure out how to destroy the alien by throwing it into its mouth (and of course it works and the entire thing blows up). <br/><br/>This movie was definitely entertaining, but in my opinion, they made Michelle out to be too much of a superhero-like character that can escape every life-threatening situation that comes her way."
"burlesonjesse5","8","1","4","21 March 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of 10 Cloverfield Lane
","Like Academy Award winner Brie Larson, Mary Elizabeth Winstead acts brilliantly with her eyes. In 10 Cloverfield Lane (my latest review), she portrays the quintessential, astute heroine. Winstead channels fear, dread, and discomfort like nobody's business. And being the only good commodity in 2011's prequel The Thing, she's now the best commodity in ""Lane"" (2016's most beguiling surprise).<br/><br/>Produced by J.J. Abrams, taking place in Louisiana, showcasing a soundtrack fastened with 60's radio hits, and having all of its plot points intricately put into their rightful places, 10 Cloverfield Lane is nifty not to mention wholly original. A majority of its running time is in enclosed spaces (agoraphobics need not worry). In terms of its final act, well ""Lane"" has a quota of squirmy, alien fare. The CGI and special effects are decent but may just be for show. You will for the most part, be more enamored by what you didn't see on the outside (the first 90 minutes are what I like to call the violence in the mind).<br/><br/>Anyway, the film with only 4 characters visible on screen, is a genre piece tested purely in psychological thrills and chills. On the surface, its structure as a sequel (to 2008's more big-budgeted Cloverfield) feels a lot like direct-to-video. Thankfully that never ends up being the case. And rightfully, ""Lane"" isn't a follow-up that continues the whole found footage BS.<br/><br/>The story begins with an outlined car crash scene so loud, so instinctive, and so unexpected, it might just make you flip out of your seat. In said crash is thirtysomething Michelle (played by Mary Winstead). Michelle has just broken off her engagement to her boyfriend Ben (voiced by Bradley Cooper). After leaving his ring and keys to his apartment on the dining room table, she drives away to someplace north of the Bayou State. A mystery motorist hits her from the back, Michelle's car spins out of control, and she ends up in a ditch. When she awakens, she finds herself constricted to an underground shelter owned by a short-tempered man named Howard Stambler (played by John Goodman). Howard has either abducted her or wants to keep her alive from an unknown, extraterrestrial/nuclear attack. Unsure of his motivations (Howie is a little rattled, a little threatening, and socially inept), Michelle vows to escape anyway even though Goodman's trouper thinks the air outside is unbreathable. She attempts this with the help of another young soul in confinement (the naive Emmett Dewitt played by John Gallagher, Jr.). Some online critics have compared 10 Cloverfield Lane to last year's Academy Award winner, Room. If that's the case then heck, sign me up.<br/><br/>Now ""Lane"" with its bedazzling score, its claustrophobic setting eliminating plenty of storyline holes, and its 1950's bunker overtones, is an effectual, nerve-shredding thriller. It evokes Hitchcock, The Twilight Zone, and doesn't need extra images of monsters to invigorate you, the viewer. Having seen Cloverfield, I didn't get much of a connection between that shaky camera vehicle and the new, supposed successor. No matter. 10 Cloverfield Lane stands on its own with three great performances (the creepy John Goodman, Winstead, and the affable John Gallagher, Jr.), a sense of disquiet that exists in the gray matter, and direction by rookie Dan Trachtenberg that feels like seasoned veteran stuff. The ending which I won't reveal, contains a level of badassery (not to mention an inkling of hope). It will make you pump your fist and feel a sense of wonderment all at the same time. My rating: 3 and a half stars.<br/><br/>Note: If you haven't seen ""Lane"" yet, brace yourself. This might sound a little weird. There's a slight homage to the 1986 flick, Pretty in Pink (yup). In that 80's relic, Molly Ringwald is an aspiring designer of clothes. She draws up attire patterns with pencils and paper. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, Winstead's Michelle does the exact same thing. She tries to design a space suit in case she escapes the isolated, underground bunker (small spoiler). Oh and look for a scene where John Goodman's Howard actually watches ""Pink"" on VHS. All hail Harry Dean Stanton (ha)."

The movie had my attention at the very beginning and didn't take long to get me interested but then I lost it. The movie got boring and I found myself drifting off. It did pull me back a few times but not enough to feel as if I've watched a great movie, when I indeed hadn't. The actors did a great job but not enough to save the movie. Then there's the ending. I won't spoil it for anyone but when it ended the grunts and uncomfortable silence in the cinema said it all. This ending was the most hilarious disappointment I've seen in a while, I actually laughed in cinema with my daughter.. I'm so surprised at the 7.9 IMDb rating for this movie.

","""Don't leave me! You don't know what's out there."" Howard (John Goodman) <br/><br/>Everything is out there in this entertaining horror flick called 10 Cloverfield Lane. It has the usual tropes but manages to be surprising at every turn and satisfying at character development. In other words, for a date you couldn't do better with something to please geeks and non geeks alike.<br/><br/>Twenty-something Michelle is abducted by Howard, imprisoning her in his survival bunker for not-so-clear motives. He's a fat middle-aged former military guy, and she's an attractive wife who just left her husband. So there's a bit of Room here, what with her confinement and a bland young man as well, Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.). It doesn't appear to be a sexual kidnapping, for Howard talks about saving her after an accident and the two of them from an alien invasion.<br/><br/>You can see my fascination about his scary but complex story because Howard may be lying about the invasion and the polluted atmosphere, or he could be substituting Michelle for his dead daughter. It's enjoyable to try to understand Howard's motives, and it's viscerally a treat to see Michelle empowered like a feminine super hero in her attempts to escape. While Cloverfield Lane is no feminist tract, it has touches of social awareness as it emphasizes her wit, the slower wit of Emmett, and the sharpness of seemingly sluggish Howard.<br/><br/>Director Dan Tractenberg and producer J.J. Abrams barely miss a chance to play the jump-scare staple, be it a hand coming up an air duct or a zombie-like woman outside the bunker's window. While devotees of the genre will be delighted by the inclusion of many formulaic elements, the regular audience should just have fun at the scary episodes leading to a somewhat surprising final segment. Or they may simply enjoy watching one of filmdom's best actors, John Goodman. A good man he is, but whether or not the character he portrays is, well, that's up to you. You'll have fun figuring it out.<br/><br/>""No! No! No, No! No! Don't open that door! You're going to get all of us killed!"" Howard"

"pyrocitor","8","1","4","18 March 2016"," Best twist yet? That a sneaky franchise-grab should be so concussively good (man)
","There's been a lot already said about 10 Cloverfield Lane, most to the effect of ""It came out of nowhere!"" and ""Whatever you do, don't spoil this movie!"" Yes, it did, and okay, fine - I won't. In the age of rampant spoilers, moviegoers could use more mystery in their lives (though the 'Cloverfield' tag is enough of a hint already). And 'mystery' is an appropriate word in more ways than one for the 'blood relative' of the 2008 found footage smash-up (thankfully, all the shaky-cam has bled out since). But, spoilers aside (I promised!), the real twist: the franchise-hungry title retrofit of the film formerly known as 'The Cellar' and 'Valencia' will lure in audiences coming for giant monster pyrotechnics, only to subject them to a lean, agonizingly tense, old-fashioned psychological thriller. It's unexpected, stripped-down, and rests firmly on the strength of its performers and writing. And it's far more satisfying and memorable than any monster mayhem it may or may not contain (teehee).<br/><br/>Cloverfield The First was an entirely sensorial experience, groundbreaking for immersing its audience into the fray of a monsterpocalypse. 10 Cloverfield Lane is even more claustrophobic, both due to its apocalyptic bunker setting, but also how much debut director Dan Trachtenberg can wring out of it. We're trapped, not in a sci-fi horror flick, but in a vintage mystery thriller - more 'whatdunnit' than 'whodunnit', or perhaps 'whatdidhedo', as the film rations out tidbits without any superfluous exposition or action to distract from the meaty interpersonal drama at play. Trachtenberg is coy with his Hitchcock influences, as the opening wordless sequence, with Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Michelle on the run, and Bear McCreary's thunderously melodramatic score, a spectacular hat tip to the great Bernard Herrmann, set the tone perfectly, situating us in Psycho territory. Scrupulously policed by the terrifyingly confusing Howard (John Goodman), we, alongside Michelle, and fellow refugee Emmett, scrabble for the tiniest clues as Trachtenberg steadily cranks up the tension like a vice. Is Howard telling the truth about their quarantine, and, if so, how much (and, regardless, is he more dangerous than the world outside)? As survival, fastidious social politics, and aspirations of escape consume Michelle, our MacGuffin, ""what's really out there?"" looms overhead (literally) like a sickening spectre, with only fleeting blips (recalling, but far more cathartic than the similarly minimalist Paranormal Activity) reinforcing how serious Howard could be about their predicament.<br/><br/>But Trachtenberg is mindful of preventing the popcorn crowds from yawning amidst the tightly wound confinement drama. The labyrinthine script kneads out every inch of potential subterfuge with a bold showiness slyly conveying the flamboyant urgency of a monster mash, keeping the proceedings dynamic, as audiences gasp for hints like fish out of water. Despite the stagnant setting, McCreary's domineering, bass drum locomotive of a score works tirelessly to keep the film stampeding along at a grimly resolute pace, while the frenzied sound editing exacerbates each screech of a door hinge and thumping on the floor (both internal and external) to jaw-clenching extremes, as Howard's volcanic mood swings guarantee no certainty or security at any point. And when we finally do snowball into 'That Ending'... well, I promised I wouldn't tell, didn't I? Suffice to say it's buckets of fun, but the real takeaway is the hour and a half potboiler proceeding it.<br/><br/>Winstead is excellent and surprisingly nuanced as the perennially put-upon Michelle, with her tenacious, indefatigable innovation and tenderly expressive eyes making her infinitely more engaging than the average 'final girl'. But if the film has one takeaway moral, it's that the incomparable John Goodman has been criminally underused as a villain throughout his impressive career, and does some of his strongest work yet here. Goodman is ferociously captivating, his massive frame and booming voice filling the bunker with more dread than any giant monster. But it's how ingeniously ambiguous Goodman builds Howard that makes him truly terrifying, allowing notes of warmth, humour, and the deepest sorrow to dance across his permanent scowl, and leaving us constantly guessing: is Howard as sinister and predatorial as we're inclined to believe, or is he actually just a seismically particular conspiracy nut and control freak, who actually has everyone's best interests in mind? It takes a truly seasoned performer to inhabit a character with such engrossing certainty. Finally, John Gallagher Jr. confidently rounds out the bunker with necessary levity and a distinctly Chris Pratt brand of laid back comedy charisma.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does give it a hefty coat of polish, thrusting a delightfully old-fashioned slab of psychological tension into the heightened urgency of a contemporary B-movie popcorn romp. A key example of a simple, solid idea done hugely justice to, thanks to rock solid work by all involved, particularly the titanic, terrifying Goodman. It's also tons of fun, and distinctly worth seeing. Just don't overhype it for yourself. Or spoil that ending. John Goodman will be watching you.<br/><br/>-8.5/10"
"lily-75186","4","1","4","18 March 2016"," So not worth the score of 8 (Tip for not familiar with Cloverfield audience: Don't watch it)
","So I was pretty excited to watch this as I was really a fan for movies with minimal budget and cast, playing in a secret locked room or something. They could always surprise you with the narrative and acting. What can I say? This movie successfully ""achieved"" both of that. I didn't watch the first Cloverfield movie, which turned out to be a huge mistake. So here, my review, is also a tip for anyone who didn't know any of Cloverfield story style. <br/><br/>I was not planning to write any spoilers because I was a fan of thrillers and hated to be ruined by spoilers. But I was too mad to write anything if I didn't mention the plot. So here you are.<br/><br/>This movie was so clever (like a roller coaster, you never get bored, quoted from other reviews) right before Howard killed Emmett. The opening was quite special and unusual which was a good thing. The sound was good, I literally got scared when the car accident happened. The acting was amazing, even include the miserable lady from outside, really dragged me into this situation. I kept wondering if Howard had some daughter-issue (so he ""kept"" Michelle like a pet or something?) And actually Emmett was with Howard to help convince Michelle that outside world was a mess. When the killing happened, I was like, oh okay, so Emmett was not a bad guy, there must be some explanations for it, fair enough. I mean, seriously, how RARE to see a clever leading female character in such movies instead of ruining everything or blaming innocent!! But everything just went so wrong. Here came the consequences where I didn't search what the first Cloverfield movies was about. Suddenly there was a real, literally, real monster, should be aliens, came from nowhere. And such a huge special effect work, was being destroyed by Michelle, with a wine bottle, and a few matches.<br/><br/>Seriously? So you spent almost 2 hours to deal with Howard, and now you took down the alien army in 5 minutes? Why you guys who gave an 8 out of 10 could stand that???<br/><br/>I was still holding some nonsense hope.First when Michelle's skin was exposed to the air, I was thinking like, oh she couldn't breathe, and next shot would be she woke up in a hospital bed, being told it was just she believed Howard's lie deeply in her mind, and with everything explained. OK of course it didn't happen. And secondly, when she got the radio working after she drove away a little bit, I was wondering, could it all be her illusion? She just got into some infinite circle, like a typical highway mystery? No, nothing! It's just a real alien attack. <br/><br/>So why Howard was lying about the daughter thing? Why everything he said just so ambiguous and suspicious? Being an audience who was not familiar with Cloverfield's monster/alien thing, but really into movies like Mulholland Drive, Triangle, Identity, and even Buried, The Night Chronicles, this movie was just so not worth an 8/10 (for now on IMDb). Why you have the budget to make such huge alien army, but not even trying to give a few more location settings or actors?"
"matthewssilverhammer","8","1","4","18 March 2016"," Don't Get In a Bunker with John Goodman
","10 Cloverfield Lane is the most unique film sequel / follow-up I've ever seen. First of all, it's nothing like its predecessor, 2008's super-fun Godzilla-esque Cloverfield. Boldly choosing to abandon the found-footage that made the original a unique smash, Lane instead leans on monster-sized amounts of claustrophobic terror and intrigue. Much of that stems from the marketing, which in true Abrams form is as opaque as a cloud of kaiju-created debris. How often do we really get a theater experience this shrouded in the unknown? When the enigmatic movie finally unspools, it projects an exceptionally scary good time. Set in a survival bunker below the ground, we are stuck with three characters as they each try and figure out what is and isn't true about their unnerving situation. The mystery is as thick as the doors keeping our characters in, and director Trachtenberg never shows his hand until need be. Masterfully going between surprising moments of humor and sit-up-in-your-chair darkness, it's hard to believe this is his first feature. On top of that, he gets some truly unforgettable performances from the strong Winstead and eccentric Goodman. Given the behind-the-scenes dudes who were part of the creation of this film (Abrams, Cloverfield's Matt Reeves, ""Daredevils"" Drew Goddard, Whiplash's Damien Chazelle), I was sort of in the bag for this movie. However, a more famous filmmaker looms above them all here, even while having no actual hand in it, as this may be the best Spielbergian movie since Jurassic Park, capturing his sense of awe and terror with aplomb. 10 Cloverfield Lane is admirably daring, crazy suspenseful, and deftly crafted horror-scifi."
"Troy_Campbell","7","1","4","17 March 2016"," Eerie, chilling and ultimately a barrel of fun.
","A ""spiritual sequel"" to Cloverfield, as producer of both films J.J. Abrams refers to it, this low-budget thriller breaks through the limitations of a single-location setting to generate mystery, apprehension and a healthy dose of the heebie-jeebies. Predominantly taking place in an underground bunker with only three inhabitants, the movie breeds unease and uncertainty on two different levels: was Earth actually attacked by extra-terrestrials? And is John Goodman's intense bunker-owner a monstrous killer? From a technical perspective, director Dan Trachtenberg effectively mines tension by juxtaposing loud, frenetic and in-your-face sequences of chaos with slowly building scenes of nerve-shredding silence and stillness. There is a point, however, when the imposing sound design becomes wearisome and the narrative propulsion relies a little too heavily on dubious plot contrivances. And the less said about the final 20 minutes – with an unwelcome and unnecessary sharp right turn – the better. The core on screen trio are a treat though. Goodman's bipolar whirlwind of a man is a force of nature you can't help but watch, whilst Mary Elizabeth Winstead is strong and likable as the sole female presence and John Gallagher Jr is endearingly normal as the third wheel. Stir into the mix a wonderfully off-kilter soundtrack and well-judged spurts of violence, and 10 Cloverfield Lane offers more than enough chills and thrills to be worth a trip to the cinema."
"eddie_baggins","6","1","4","15 March 2016"," An effective thriller dominated by Goodman's terrific turn
","What a strange situation one finds themselves in when talking about a film like 10 Cloverfield Lane, one that somehow, in today's climate of information overload, managed to remain secret until launching during this year's Superbowl extravaganza despite it being a sequel/prequel or who-really-knows-what to 2008's Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Produced by the frequently busy and impressively consistent J.J Abrams, 10 Cloverfield Lane is easily one of the most mysterious releases of recent times and benefits greatly from its short life in the public exposure spotlight before releasing late last week, as it is a story and experience that is best watched how it was intended to be: with as little foresight into its goings on as possible. While the film is by no means earth-shatteringly good, it's an effective thriller that acts as a fine companion piece to its shaky cam for-bearer.<br/><br/>Ditching the format of Matt Reeves original film, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a much more intimate and confined story that is every bit as mysterious as the film's conception. Without giving the it's subtle twists and turns away, at its core Lane is the story of Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Michelle who finds herself underground and sheltered from a supposedly earth shattering attack by John Goodman's conspiracy theory loving, ex-Navy vet Howard, who has long been preparing for the end of days. Joining the mismatched duo is John Gallagher Jr's Emmett, a kindly farmer type that helped build Howard's shelter, and we therefore have our players in this fingernail chewing narrative.<br/><br/>First time feature length director Dan Trachtenberg and screenwriters including Whiplash director Damien Chazelle do fine jobs of hiding the relatively simple set up of the film, by using a clever pacing and gradual reveal of character motivations and traits, and for the film's opening third that is totally dominated by an awards worthy turn from a scarily good John Goodman. Lane is an absorbing watch let down only by some questionable decision making and a final 20 minutes that undoes much of the film's groundwork that was so successfully laid, and with that a slight feeling of disappointment lingers as the credits roll on and we're left to reminisce about the movie's earlier glories.<br/><br/>Those expecting 10 Cloverfield Lane to be cut from the same cloth as its namesake will be disappointed, but within this often tense and finely tuned thriller is an impressively taut tale that's bought to life brilliantly by Goodman (who hasn't been better in years) and to a lesser extent leading lady Winstead who keeps threatening to really break out with each passing project.<br/><br/>It's a joy overall to sit back and watch a film you know very little about, and without the usually strong expectations of yearlong marketing campaigns at its back 10 Cloverfield Lane is an enjoyable success let down somewhat by an ending better suited to another film and decision making by its characters that at times ruin the films good work.<br/><br/>3 unfinished cat puzzles out of 5"
"raechillcharlie","6","1","4","15 March 2016"," Misleading as a Sequel/Follow-up
","I went to see this movie excited and expecting a full-on Cloverfield sequel. I want to warn you, this movie will disappoint in that aspect. As a thriller or horror movie, it's great. If you dislike the jump scares and extreme tension that accompany horror movies, this film is not for you.<br/><br/>I left the movie feeling like it was a horror movie with some sci-fi bits tacked on at the end, and I wasn't wrong. The producers admitted the screenplay was originally a horror screenplay titled ""The Cellar"", based off a book (if I'm not mistaken). For some reason, J.J. and his crew decided it should belong to the Cloverfield name. I disagree.<br/><br/>Sci-fi horror is great if it makes sense and feels completely within both genres. For all the hemming and hawing about a Cloverfield sequel/follow-up, this was a disappointing answer to the challenge presented by the original director. It truly did not live up to those standards. There are aliens, yes. But in no way could I reconcile the style or unequivocally, the story with its predecessor. This movie should not be marketed with the Cloverfield family, and I am sorry I watched it with those intentions."
"jim9tan","Null","1","4","15 March 2016"," Film did not fully exploit its potential

Mary Winstead photographed well. There was some good dynamics of the three people hunkered down. The aliens appeared briefly at the end and was credible.<br/><br/>However, I feel that the dynamics of the three-persons needed to be explored further. Shifting alliances etc. In addition, I would have liked to see a stronger transformation of the heroine from scared young woman to fighter.

"bkrauser-81-311064","7","1","4","12 March 2016"," J.J. Abrams and his Magic Box
","In March of 2007, J.J. Abrams took to the TED Talk stage and spoke to a captive audience about his creative process. He equated his storytelling techniques to an old magic box he bought when he was a kid. ""You look a Star Wars...you don't know who that mysterious woman is; mystery box...you open up the message in the droid, she wants to find Obi-Wan Kenobi, but who is that; mystery box."" Inside those boxes are endless possibilities that keep the viewer in suspense until that magical moment the box is finally opened. 10 Cloverfield Lane is that aesthetic philosophy put into practice by incredibly talented people both behind and in front of the camera.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane starts with Michelle (Winstead) packing up her belongings and driving to parts unknown. In the dead of night, Michelle is run off the road and wakes up in a windowless room, attached to a I.V. drip and handcuffed to a pipe. In comes Howard (Goodman), a lumbering, menacing older man who calmly informs her there has been a nationwide attack of some kind. Luckily she was saved in the nick of time by Howard who had his underground bunker built years prior. Naturally, Michelle is suspicious and looks to escape, yet after fellow cohabitant Emmett (Gallagher) confirms Howard's doomsday tale, she must decide whether she's safer in the bunker or outside.<br/><br/>Is this film meant to be a sequel to Cloverfield (2008) the popular found-footage film that made J.J. Abrams a household name? If so, instead of making the sequel bigger, louder and dumber than its predecessor, the film is a tiny, smartly done chamber piece that masterfully plays on the audiences' expectations. This movie is fierce giving the internal and external threats to Michelle's well- being constantly in the minds of the viewers, all while giving us a mystery of sorts to solve.<br/><br/>Much of the credit must be given to the three fine actors who take up the entire movie. Winstead is wonderful as our resourceful and instinctual heroine. As the stakes are inevitably raised higher and higher, she resists succumbing to Bad Decision Syndrome (BDS) and stays ahead of the audience in new and creative ways. Gallagher stumbles a bit when accentuating the balance between southern good 'ol boy and cautious gentleman. Yet his character proves endearing as he breaks the tension between Michelle and Howard on several occasions. If there's one person proving to be the true standout however, it's John Goodman.<br/><br/>Part of the mystery surrounding 10 Cloverfield Lane is Howard's true temperament and intentions. One minute the man is calm, even friendly to his fellow house guests; other moments he explodes with furious anger without much provocation. Howard can be seen by some as a surrogate or a mouthpiece to anti-society types who prep for the coming apocalypse and would take great relish in saying ""I told you so."" Yet because this kind of attitude largely exists in the fringes, Howard; either through nature or nurture, cannot cope with other human beings. It is revealed early on that Howard brought Michelle to the bunker but if his story is to be believed, for what reason did he bring her? I have my own theory which would explain Howard's natural antagonism towards Emmett. Ironic that a man so dedicated to saving his own life has completely lost his humanity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the ""practical"" purpose for bringing Michelle to the bunker is largely left unexplored which likely helped the film keep it's PG-13 rating but does it no favors either. The film has other faults including tipping its hand too early when it comes to whether the nationwide attack was real or a figment of Howard's imagination. There's also a third act reveal that seems to resolve itself far too quickly. Yet under novice director Dan Trachtenberg's confident vision and the watchful eye of producers J.J. Abrams, Drew Goddard and Matt Reeves et al. this creepy little film has enough Hitchcockian suspense to stem any oversights.<br/><br/>Despite largely taking place in a single multi-roomed bunker, 10 Cloverfield Lane feels like a high quality B-horror film with some surprising twists and turns. The characters are strong and interesting and the events are all generated naturally from the decisions of the characters and not some cockamamie high-concept conceit. It's interesting that an intimate movie like this can be spun-off of a larger than life found footage film monster movie. I guess sometimes the greatest mysteries can come from the smallest packages."
"Field78","6","1","4","14 March 2016"," A strangely uneven mix of thrills and disappointments
","Eight years ago, Cloverfield was a very effective genre mix of Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project. It became a hype that delivered, thanks to a brilliant viral marketing campaign which enticed the audience with shocking images, but without revealing too much of the story itself. I guess it could be called a miracle that the makers were able to wait so long and (undoubtedly) resist studio pressure for a quick sequel, and then produce a successor under the radar, one whose existence wasn't revealed until a few months before the premiere.<br/><br/>That is the good news. The bad news is that 10 Cloverfield Lane is a disappointing sequel on many levels. First of all, it isn't even a sequel. Marketing it with creative re-use of the original's title really created some false expectations, because 10CL has nothing to do whatsoever with its predecessor. It has a completely separate story, no familiar characters or locations, and the events of the previous film aren't mentioned or even referenced. In genuine J.J. Abrams 'Lost' style, you would have expected to see something familiar on a TV screen or in a picture frame to connect the dots, but there isn't (apart from a 'Slusho' sign, and there may be a 'Kelvin' reference that I missed, but those don't count). The closest 10CL comes to is a companion piece or side story set in the same universe, but the only small narrative connection to the original (something with a satellite) is such an obscure geeky reference that 99% of viewers will only discover it on this film's trivia page. It would have been great had it started out as something completely separate, and then slowly revealed its connections to the original. This could have created a stand-alone sequel, while still engaging the audience with insider hints. Sadly, the makers missed this opportunity, which isn't entirely surprising, since this movie was originally an unrelated film that was reworked into a Cloverfield successor halfway through.<br/><br/>But still, even a disappointing sequel or side story can be great in its own right. I have enjoyed movies like Hannibal and installments in the Alien and Terminator series that way. I am not fundamentally opposed to the idea of a successor that is completely different in style and execution. No found footage-style cinematography this time, since 10CL is a psychological thriller rather than a adrenaline-fueled creature feature. This is okay as long as it is done well, but here it all felt way too familiar for me. Producer J.J Abrams is certainly no stranger to recycling familiar plots and elements from other movies, but he usually combines or presents them in ways that makes them feel fresh again (just look at Cloverfield, Super 8 and The Force Awakens). Unfortunately, the main plot of 10CL in the bunker is more than a little bit similar to a story arc from the second season of his own series 'Lost', whereas the finale evokes a strong déjà-vu from several better science-fiction movies. Never before did one of his productions feel unoriginal to the point of being worn out. <br/><br/>And there is more to complain. The beginning certainly shows promise, with Mary E. Winstead leaving her apartment with only the score playing. After an adrenaline-spiking accident, the movie shifts back gear to the most boring part of the movie. We are supposed to invest in the trio of characters, but they are too one-dimensional for us to really care. Winstead's character clearly had some relationship issues, but the writers simply fail to use that premise later on to the character's (and story's) advantage. John Goodman is always good as a man who looks and acts like he means well, but can turn violent in a second (it was almost hard not to think of his work in several Coen brothers movies, if I'm honest). The script certainly creates a compelling mystery surrounding his past actions and present intentions, but again, when it is time for the pay-off at the end, the writers simply do not deliver on that promise. John Gallagher is the only one who benefits from a character scene which makes his persona less than the average redneck he starts out to be, and he gives the movie the memorable twist that actually works (more about that later). <br/><br/>There are other good things to be said for the movie. After 45 minutes of boring character introductions, the movie starts to pick up pace and build tension. It was no doubt the creators' intention to keep the audience guessing if the danger comes from outside, or from within, and it works until about 15 minutes before the end. Then we get another twist that answers that question, and although it brings back some of the thrill and adrenalin that Cloverfield had, it simply doesn't feel satisfying; 15 minutes really is too short, and it is such an abrupt change in style and genre that it pretty much reduces the first 90 minutes to an overlong and unimportant prologue. Again, with better writing, the three acts could have been married happily together instead of feeling like three completely separate movies.<br/><br/>So to summarize, 10CL is a bold attempt to extend the cinematic universe from Cloverfield in another direction, but sadly without much of the ingenuity and spark of inspiration that we are used to from J.J. Abrams' team. He calls it a 'blood relative' to the original; I'd say its that slacker of a second cousin twice removed that everyone prefers to ignore. It looks like the Master of Pop Culture himself was too busy with producing and directing The Force Awakens, so if they are making a third one to bridge the first two films, I recommend having him fully back on board."
"dave-mcclain","8","1","4","12 March 2016"," ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a great ""spiritual successor"" to 2008's ""Cloverfield"".
","When is a movie a ""spiritual successor""? No, it doesn't have anything to do with ghosts procreating. A movie that is a spiritual successor or spiritual sequel to its predecessor is a movie that doesn't follow the same story line as the original, but has enough in common with the original's setting, themes or style that the new movie can be seen as ""in the spirit of"" the film to which it's being compared. Another way to think about it is that the two movies exist in the same cinematic universe. They often also have the same production team. The closest example that comes to mind is the pair of ""300"" movies. The 2014 film ""300: Rise of an Empire"" had some overlap with the 2006 film ""300"" in time period, setting, themes and style, but had its own story almost completely apart from the story told in the first film.<br/><br/>Similarly, the 2016 film ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" (PG-13, 1:43) is a distant relative of 2008's found-footage science fiction monster movie ""Cloverfield"". (Call them second cousins twice removed.) ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is based on a screenplay entitled ""The Cellar"" which Paramount purchased in 2012 and gave to J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions to develop it further. Bad Robot had produced the original ""Cloverfield"" and Abrams has said that ""The Cellar"" had ""so many elements that felt like the DNA of this story were of the same place that 'Cloverfield' was born out of."" Abrams adds that his company produced this film as a ""blood relative"" of ""Cloverfield"". Unfortunately, using the name of the original in the title of its very different successor is a bit of a spoiler, but the setting (mostly underground), the themes (wondering what's really happening when you can't see it) and style (traditional camera-work rather than ""found footage""), allows Movie Fans to still enjoy this film, whether they saw (and liked) ""Cloverfield"" or not.<br/><br/>Speaking of avoiding spoilers, doing so prevents me from going as far into the plot of this movie as I usually do in my reviews, but here's the basic set-up: Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Michelle, a young Louisiana woman who leaves her fiancé, Ben (Bradley Cooper). As she's driving down an isolated 2-lane highway, she gets into a car accident that leaves her injured and unconscious. She wakes up in an underground bunker in the care of a survivalist who identifies himself as Howard (John Goodman). He tells Michelle that he saved her life – not just from dying of her injuries – but from an ""attack"" that has left everyone above ground either dead or dying. He says he's not sure if the attack was perpetrated by the Russians, the Martians, or(?), but he's adamant that leaving the bunker would mean certain death.<br/><br/>Michelle is skeptical, to say the least, even after she meets the bunker's other resident, Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) who backs up everything Howard has said. Emmett is a contractor who helped Norman build his doomsday bunker over a period of years and then fought to be let in when, lo and behold, Armageddon actually happened! Howard is a Navy veteran who seems paranoid and occasionally exhibits other odd and even volatile behaviors, but his end-of-the-world man cave does have all the comforts of home and it does appear that Howard has saved their lives, so Michelle and Emmett settle in, become friends and even learn to get along with Howard for a while. As with all good thrillers, surprises, suspense and a struggle for survival await some or all of the main characters.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a great spiritual successor that builds on the legacy of ""Cloverfield"" with an entirely different framework. The unusual circumstances that I related above regarding how this movie came to be provide us with an original story that effectively taps into the original's fear and sense of foreboding. The plot allows for a departure from the overused found-footage format and gives us a uniquely creepy and claustrophobic vibe. The performances also come across as very authentic. Early in the movie, we feel Michelle's disorientation and fear. Then, we are put somewhat at ease by Emmett's presence and his good-guy friendliness. Throughout the film, much like those two characters do, we alternate between feeling good about Norman and being suspicious of him. Is he paranoid because he's crazy? Is he crazy because he's paranoid? Or is he simply a well-meaning but neurotic loner who has been thrown off his game by unexpectedly living out an apocalyptic version of ""Three's Company""? And how does the 2008 film relate to all this? All good questions. On its way to giving us good answers, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" keeps us off balance, but will ultimately satisfy most Movie Fans, whether they saw (and liked) ""Cloverfield"" or not. ""A-"""

","The movie was okay, but I think I was expecting it to have a stronger relationship to Cloverfied (which I really liked). However, that was not the case, well at least for most of the movie. I'm glad that I had coffee throughout this movie as I am pretty sure I would have slept in between scenes. I feel like this movie just left a lot of unanswered questions and unknowns. For most of the movie the main characters are stuck inside the bunker the entire time. I really gotta give a great applause to all the actors though. They did an awesome job! Only if it had more action then this movie would have been way better. I would not mind sticking around for another 30 minutes for more action."
"mdyer-11","8","1","4","12 March 2016"," A Novel Slant on the ""Woman-in-Peril"" Genre
","I enjoyed this movie while I watched it but found it ultimately unsatisfying.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the ""Woman-in-Peril"" genre. In this genre some sadistic guy has control over a young woman and the suspense is whether or not a team of investigators can save her in time. Meanwhile, the audience gets occasional, lurid scenes of her fear and suffering, and of the sadist's twisted personality and unpredictable behavior.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the less concentration on a woman's suffering, the better the genre. On the other hand, if the woman shows great self-reliance and intelligence in the face of danger, then that will enhance any movie within this genre.<br/><br/>What makes 10 Cloverfield Lane a very superior version of this genre is: excellent acting on the part of John Goodman, great self-reliance and intelligence on the part of Mary Winstead, and the novel slant of an ever-changing mystery concerning the overall situation<br/><br/>The movie is also within the Sci-Fi genre. Before I saw this movie I noticed that some reviewers said that the movie was terrible until the end while others said it was wonderful until the end. I found it strange that those who liked the first 90% of the movie disliked the last 10% while others, who disliked the first 90%, suddenly liked the remaining 10%. After I saw the movie I understood perfectly why this was the case.<br/><br/>Since I do not want to give anything away, let me just say that the movie does contain a Sci-Fi element but the two genres are very poorly integrated with each other. <br/><br/>If you enjoy Woman-in-Peril suspense movies, then you should definitely see this movie. If you don't like Woman-in-Peril and you wanted mainly to see a Sci-Fi movie, then you will be disappointed (even though there is definitely a Sci-Fi element in it)."
"bankofmarquis","7","1","4","12 March 2016"," Claustrophobic and Gripping
","Trust me, this IS a review for 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE, it will just take me awhile to get to there.<br/><br/>I loved Steven Spielberg's 2005 version of WAR OF THE WORLDS (starring Tom Cruise). It embued an atmosphere of foreboding and claustrophobia while giving us an alien invasion story.<br/><br/>I also love Lenny Abrahamson's recent Academy Award nominated film ROOM (the film in which Brie Larson deservedly won the Best Actress Oscar) which told the tale of a mother and son held hostage.<br/><br/>Why am I speaking of these two films? Because if you combine these two films you get 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE - a film in the ""Cloverfield family of films"" (don't call it a sequel). <br/><br/>For those of you who don't remember, CLOVERFIELD was JJ Abrams 2008 ""found footage"" alien invasion flick. As Abrams describes it, 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE is a different ride in the CLOVERFIELD AMUSEMENT PARK - and what a different ride it is!<br/><br/>10 CLOVERFIELD LANE tells the story of Michelle (a very good Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who wakes up in a bunker after a car crash. She has been brought there by Howard (and even better John Goodman). Did he save her? Is she being held hostage? Is his story of alien invasion just a ruse? Is Howard sane? All of these questions need to be answered in the course of this film, and it's the journey to find the answers that makes this film so enjoyable - as well as the action packed last 20 minutes.<br/><br/>It is a claustrophobic film, for it spends it's first hour and 20 minutes inside Howard's bunker and we are relying on the interplay between Howard and Michelle to propel this film forward. There is a 3rd person in the bunker, Emit (John Gallagher, Jr). Unfortunately for him (and the actor playing him), this character acts mostly as a foil for the other two so never really has the gravitas of Winstead and Goodman.<br/><br/>But the interplay between the two leads is very, very good. Winstead has never been better than she is here as Michelle, the surrogate for us audience members trying to make sense of what is being told her. But this movie really belongs to Goodman. He is a commanding presence who commands the screen every time he is on it and moves from gentle and happy to intense and dangerous at a moment's notice. Is he crazy or is he just trying to keep everyone alive? A truly good actor keeps us guessing and Goodman is a truly good actor.<br/><br/>The direction by relative novice director Dan Trachtenberg is surprising good and smooth, keeping us on the edge of our seats - and unsure - throughout this movie. <br/><br/>The ""make or break"" of whether you buy into this movie happens in the last 20 minutes, and I won't spoil it here, but, I went with it and really enjoyed my time at 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE.<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
"mistergutsy2299","8","1","4","11 March 2016"," A Double Bladed Sword
","10 Cloverfield Lane currently seems to be gaining A LOT of controversy on the Internet. I myself was a huge fan of the original film, having seen it multiple times I consider myself a big fan of all things Cloverfield. So of course you can imagine my excitement to this movie being announced 2 months before release.<br/><br/>So I head to my local theater on opening night, I expected that the only people who would be there would be die-hard Cloverfield fans like myself. And I was right for the most part. There we all were, sitting down, popcorn ready, all smiles and ready to see the continuation of a long gone franchise.<br/><br/>I know now what the people who saw the Phantom Menace for the first time felt. <br/><br/>Make no mistake this movie isn't actually bad, just disappointing. I feel very conflicted about this movie, so let me review it as best as I can, good things first.<br/><br/>Well the good part? The film is gripping with performance. We only have 3 lead actors in this movie but they all do a very good job. John Goodman is uneasy and menacing as his character, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic as Michelle and John Gallagher, Jr. as Emmett is also very good. They're basically the only characters we have throughout the film and luckily they do a great job. If any of them had given a bad performance then this film would have been a disaster.<br/><br/>And the emotion the film creates in you has to be commended as well! It serves up good doses of paranoia and the feeling of claustrophobia. You legitimately feel as though you're in this bunker with these people. <br/><br/>Now let's get down to the bad. Simply put 10 Cloverfield Lane is a double-sided blade. On on hand you can recognize that this is a good film. But on the other hand the movie is hurt by its title. <br/><br/>It's no secret that when you have the word 'Cloverfield' in your title, people will expect, oh I don't know A MONSTER. It would be like if Steven Spielberg released a movie called 'Tales of Jaws.' You would fully expect this to be a movie about Jaws and you'd get excited. But then when you head in the theater you realize that the movie is just comprised of a series of stories set in the sea with no relation to Jaws.<br/><br/>You're fully expecting to see anything related to Cloverfield as you watch this movie but there's nothing! The best I can figure is the presence of the company Slusho which is a big part of the Cloverfield mythology. But your average moviegoer isn't going to know this! The average moviegoer expects to see a monster or maybe hear about the fate of the characters from the first movie but there's nothing!<br/><br/>Something horrible is that it seems like at times the movie ITSELF is misleading you. There are moments in this movie when it seems like Clover (the monster from Cloverfield) is going to show up. And by the time the ending of the movie rolls around you're 99% sure that Clover is going to be outside the bunker!<br/><br/>And that leads me to my biggest complaint about the movie. The twist. I won't spoil what it is because the twist has to be SEEN to be BELIEVED. It comes out of nowhere like a freight train and it's so laughably bad that it makes the twist in the Happening look like the twist from Fight Club. I'm telling you, as soon as my theater audience saw the twist I could feel as though everyone wanted to burst out laughing. I know I did.<br/><br/>So the thing that really kills this movie is its own marketing. I know that the original title of the movie was called 'The Cellar' and it should have stayed that way. The movie was purposefully renamed '10 Cloverfield Lane' in order to sell tickets. Nothing more. Blood relative said JJ? Yeah right, this movie has more in common with my Fallout fan fiction than it does Cloverfield. What does that even mean? I don't know, I'm just so angry at this movie.<br/><br/>Some people won't like this review. And that's fair. If you were to just wipe your brain clean of this movie being hailed as a spiritual successor to Cloverfield and saw it as its own movie then yeah, it's a good movie. Without a shred of doubt. But unfortunately the movie is also hurt by its own title and marketing ploy and I can't let that escape me.<br/><br/>I'm going to give 10 Cloverfield Lane a B-"

","I like films like 10 Cloverfield Lane with people cooped up in a barricaded location and tension building up between them. Despite the poor writing and the average performances, this was pretty good for a mainstream 21st century American film. It had me riveted till the end. There is some nonsense in it like the ridiculous creature and the way the heroine fights it with relative ease.<br/><br/>But my expectations for mainstream American sci-fi films are so low, I ended up enjoying this. There were a sufficient number of imaginative thrills (especially Winstead's crawl across the claustrophobic tunnel) and just the idea of three people surviving inside an underground bunker after a nuclear attack was very very interesting.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead is not a great actress. But she is nice to look at. The makers accentuated her beautiful body by making her wear tight jeans. She was a sultry presence in the midst of the two men. John Goodman could have played this role in his sleep. I wonder whether him playing a paranoid character in The Big Lebowski had anything to do with his casting as a survivalist nut.<br/><br/>(6/10)"

","Really effective twisting, turning, second-guessing suspense with an ending that hangs around for way too long and disrupts the great atmosphere it had just established. For the most part, this is a fine example of making the most of a small set and an even smaller cast. The three-person acting team draws every bit of fear, loathing, confusion and betrayal from the simple, efficient script. We explore every nook and cranny of John Goodman's bunker until it all feels like home, making for a thrilling game of hide-and-seek when the tension inevitably boils over. The terror is mostly psychological and quiet, which makes the infrequent bursts of sound and fury all the more effective. These aren't just jump-cuts, they're bullets through the fog. They carry meaning and consequence, reverberating well beyond the moment of impact. And if it had ended about ten minutes earlier, the shock of its final reveal would've been maintained without spoiling any of that work. A pity, then, that it reaches all the way into summer blockbuster territory in some vain attempt to tie things into an otherwise-unrelated preceding film. This may not have enjoyed as many eyeballs without that extra word in the title, but it would've been so much more effective as a film."
"thesar-2","9","1","5","8 May 2016"," Room 2: Out-Break
","As much as I liked the ""first"" Cloverfield – one of only two or three found-footage films that actually worked, this one topples that. <br/><br/>What an incredible twist to that Monsters Attack film. I am aware this didn't start off as a sorta spin-off, and for that, I was weary up front. It did start off interesting, got better, slowed a bit with the typical ""fun"" captive scenes and thencontained one of the most heart- pounding, thrilling and satisfying endings I have seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>I'm jumping ahead. Basically, Dan Conner may or may not have been a paranoid kidnapper, but he's still keeping Ramona Flowers against her will in an underground bunker with neighbor and ""survivor"" Not-Ryan Reynolds. Story has it, the above ground has been under attack, first with deadly gases and followed by a ground invasion. Is it true? Should the damsel in distress leave the bunker and safety for the unknown? Does she have a choice?<br/><br/>Already loved Mary Elizabeth Winstead (the aforementioned female) and she did NOT disappoint here. But, the winner goes to John Goodman's fantastic performance as the captor. I would love him to be nominated for this role. <br/><br/>Well shot and the intensity grows and grows and keep multiplying until the great conclusion I mentioned. Do you need to see 2008's Cloverfield to get this? Not really. I mean, I would still recommend it on its own and it couldn't hurt to even put you more on edge here, but not 100% necessary. <br/><br/>Loved this movie and not since last year's similarly toned and plotted Ex Machina have I felt this way while watching a film. In fact, these two films would be an absolute perfect double feature.<br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: In the recommendation of a double feature of Ex Machina and 10 Cloverfield Lane, it probably would be best to leave out the original Cloverfield in that scenario's movie night. Again, I would recommend the 2008 Giant Monster movie, it just wouldn't mesh with these two movies. If you take anything from the above review, I would highly consider this duo for a great sci-fi night of suburb thrillers."
"luke-a-mcgowan","5","1","5","8 May 2016"," The ending is so bad for a movie that was so good
","The first half of this movie reminded me of the first season of Lost. Full of mysteries, a fascinatingly acted group of characters and a high tension atmosphere where something could happen any second. John Goodman knocks it out of the park as a deranged, dangerous doomsday prophesier. His physical presence is absolutely unequalled and Goodman knows just what to do with it. But at the same time, he's John Goodman - he's Sully, and you just want inherently to trust him. The themes of domestic violence are strong throughout, and the film is truly claustrophobic.<br/><br/>The last fifteen minutes reminded me of Lost after season 2. You want resolution to the kidnapping mystery? I don't care. The woman who came to the door was a red herring and made no sense at the end of the movie? Screw you. You think Rey was too good at things in Star Wars, well Michelle can use molotov cocktails to destroy alien aircraft because f*** yeah, feminism. I was fine with Damien Chazelle rewriting the ending to ensure that the message was not ""she should've stayed in the basement"", as that was something I was worried about. By 10 Cloverfield Lane left a sour taste in my mouth. It out Edge of Tomorrow'd Edge of Tomorrow. It should've stuck with something more appropriate for the tension and the mystery."
"siderite","7","1","5","7 May 2016"," Slow paced mystery thriller with some sci-fi thrown in for marketing purposes
","Some parts of the movie were great, some not so much. An unevenly good film with a great concept, good acting but some pacing problems. Since the whole idea of the film was to watch it without knowing anything about its story or concept, I suggest you do just that before you read any reviews.<br/><br/>That being said, John Goodman was perfect for his role. He was equal parts a lovable teddy bear (check out the scene when he put on some music - LOL) and a really creepy crazy person. The other actors were OK, but I wouldn't call their performances great. The story is taking people you know nothing about and putting them in a situation where reality cannot be verified. When someone says or does something, you wonder if they are crazy or they are actually for real.<br/><br/>In effect, the result is a slow paced character piece. It is not about sci-fi and it is not about what the hell is going on - even if you wonder about that the whole movie. It is about the people. However, since nothing is revealed until the end of the film and since you know nothing of the people to start with, it is very difficult to empathize with any of them, therefore it all feels like a too long escape from a room type of a game.<br/><br/>The ending is just something that artificially connects this film with Cloverfield and tries to add the sci-fi tag to it. It makes little sense and in fact it is the reason why I only rated this movie as average.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if not for JJ's pretentiousness, it would have made a really good Outer Limits episode. As such it feels too long and the ending just makes it feel fake. Too bad, it was a refreshing concept."

","I read the movie industry blurb about this movie not really being a sequel to Cloverfield so I went to it not knowing what to expect. Personally I thought that they should have tried to make it more of a sequel to Cloverfield or done something not related to any other films. I found the whole thing a bit gratuitous. John Goodman is always in watchable movies and I think him being caste in this helped it work as a drama-since it can only vaguely be called a science fiction film. What they did is use a background of science fiction to play out an interpersonal drama-which is OK I guess but I think if that is what they were going to do they could have come up with their own science fiction scenario rather than borrowing someone else's idea. I thought there should have been more to it."

Is there anything beyond the bunker, if so, how do you know?<br/><br/>Leading on from this, can the heroine of the piece trust her apparent savior who she is forced to share the bunker with? Is he what he appears to be or is he a monster? Is it worth finding out what, if anything, exists beyond the bunker? Does this unknown risk outweigh any perceived risk, her bunker companions may present? <br/><br/>This is premise this thriller is built upon and, indeed, for the most part, this film is more thriller, than sci fi. The tension is gradually ratcheted up, as ""what if"" suspicions are raised, dropped and then raised again. <br/><br/>This is a well acted film with solid performances by the cast but its in no way an exceptional film. ""Interesting"" is a good way of describing 10 Cloverfield Lane. It engages the viewer in much the same way, as a competently directed and acted ""who dunnit"". You start asking questions and keep watching to see if you can work out where the film is going. <br/><br/>To be honest, for the most part, this film is fairly predictable. I'd guessed quite early on what was happening but was caught out, to a degree by the final, final ending. I did not see it coming but, its unlikely anyone would.

(Can't explain this mess without spoilers so be warned.)<br/><br/>Okay. First thing. This film has absolutely NOTHING to do with Cloverfield. Nothing. Period. Even the weird aliens that turn up at the end look nothing like what was presented in Cloverfield and their presence is short, so get it out of your head that this has anything to do with Cloverfield.<br/><br/>Other than that, this was about as entertaining as two episodes of The Walking Dead back to back minus the zombies. Sure, there was some suspense, but nothing more than you'll see in a cable television show. John Goodman lost a little weight since his whale of an appearance in Trumpo but he's still way out of shape, gasping for breath just to move across the room, so the idea that two healthy young people can't take him on in his little bunker is just absurd. Just put some of those cans of food in a sock and whack him over the head already, I was saying to myself.<br/><br/>So most of the movie is John Goodman holding two younger adults hostage in his bunker while we aren't sure what exactly has happened outside. At one point the young woman almost escapes but she sees another woman trying to get into the bunker who is like, I don't know, burning up, or dying from some disease, or bubbling from acid air or something. But then when the young woman finally escapes toward the end there is no acid air or poison air or whatever so what was that all about? I don't know. Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Okay, so basically, most of the movie is John Goodman holding these guys in his bunker against their will and then the young woman escapes to find out indeed the world has been taken over by aliens and then it's like, okay, tune in to episode three, except there is no episode<br/><br/>The end."

","I had high expectations for 10 Cloverfield Lane. I went in expecting a mystery/thriller, one that would keep you on the edge of your seat with anticipation (and not with the need to vomit, as some so-called thrillers do.) What I got was a movie that was entertaining, but nowhere near believable. And no, I'm not just talking about the final scene with the aliens. John Goodman is a skilled actor, and portrays one hell of a creep- emphasized by his mood swings, paranoia, and ability to effortlessly establish Stockholm Syndrome in Emmett- but surviving immersion in corrosive acid is completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>At the beginning, we get a sense of claustrophobia- reminiscent of 2015's 'Room'. We know Howard (the captor) is crazy. He feeds Michelle a story about the air above being contaminated, and everyone above ground being dead. He saved her life. Can't she show a little gratitude? Soon she meets naïve farmboy Emmett, another prisoner in the bunker- albeit a willing one. He has clearly bought into Howard's psychobabble about keeping them safe and alive. However, Howard's mood swings, controlling behavior, and inconsistent stories about the mysterious ""Megan"" lead Michelle and Emmett to team up and plan an escape.<br/><br/>I liked the intensity near the beginning of the film...but the zany special effects and the addition of Martians at the end (He was right all along!) ruined the experience for me.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a thriller, a sci-fi, or a mystery, look elsewhere.

The acting performances are top-notch, starting with John Goodman as Howard, but Mary Elizabeth Winstead, best known from indie movies like ""Smashed"" and ""A.C.O.D."", is equally impressive as Michelle. john Gallagher, Jr. as Emmett rounds out the cast (yes, one could say that the majority of a movie is a filmed play set in a bunker). The boyfriend who calls Michelle early in the movie is voices by... Bradley Cooper! Last but not least, there is a nice orchestral score, courtesy of composer Bear McCreary.<br/><br/>""10 Cloverfield Lane"" opened this weekend nationwide. I had seen the trailer a number of times, and couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not nearly as packed as I had expected it to be. Regardless, if you are in the mood for a good mystery-thriller, you can count on having a finger-lickin' good time with this movie. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
"Pumpkin_Man","9","1","5","12 March 2016"," A Great Suspense Driven Story With a Very Cheesy Sci-Fi Twist!!!
","First off, this movie is hardly a sequel or a prequel to 2008's Cloverfield. Maybe in some way, it's a spin-off. Only time will tell. 95% of the movie is its own thing. It's during the last ten minutes where it might come close to being related to the first movie. This review might contain some spoilers. I've heard that this film was originally known as The Cellar. At the last minute, the producers tweaked a few things to try and make it related to Cloverfield. The story itself was actually very good and very intriguing. When I saw the trailers, I didn't know what to expect. It's very driven by suspense, almost like that of a Hitchcock film. It's kind of a mix between Saw, Misery, and a film called Otis. John Goodman's character is scary at times. You never know when he's going to crack. <br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Final Destination 3, Live Free or Die Hard) stars as Michelle, a woman on the run from her broken relationship. During a car crash, she wakes up in Howard's underground bunker, chained to the wall. Howard tells her he saved her life and claims that the world outside is now uninhabitable due to the nuclear or chemical fallout from ""an attack."" (One thing I loved was that we never knew until the end if Howard was telling the truth, or making up crazy stories just to keep Michelle and another man, Emmett captive for himself.) Michelle tries to escape but soon learns that monsters come in many forms. I like that it was isolated and claustrophobic and mostly kept in one location as the three main stars bond, play games, listen to music and watch TV. In a weird way it reminded me of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead when the four friends were confined to the mall. At first, I was thrown off and let down by the twist in the last half, but my friend gave me his explanation and it make a little more sense. The film as a whole is definitely starting to grow on me. As I said, the movie is very driven by great suspense and some decent character development. It's like a great suspense classic from the 70's, but made for modern times with a decent science fiction twist. I would definitely recommend 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE!!!"

","10 cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Goodman, and John Gallagher Jr. First off, we all know that this movie came out of nowhere and they didn't very give us much about the plot. I loved going into this movie knowing nothing. I will say that I enjoyed this movie a lot but it did have small/minor problems. The acting, directing was fantastic by everyone. It was such a small cast but the tension between everyone was done great. John Goodman plays this creepy dude so great. Lots of great scenes with him but who steals the movie is Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She was amazing. She has proved she can carry a whole movie and I hope she gets more roles after this. Now Dan Trachtenberg. This is was his first big time movie and he also knocked it out of the park. Also excited to see what he does next. Now the minor problems I've had with it. The first one is at times the movie slows down, only like once or twice and the other part where I think people will be split is the ending. It ends in an odd way, which some people will like and some won't. For me I was in the middle, it was an okay ending. Overall 10 Cloverfield Lane was a great thriller/mystery with fantastic performances by everyone. Every scene was shot great thanks to Trachtenberg. Only true negative would be the ending, which will leave people split. You should go see it in theaters."

Indeed. - ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" certainly did have its fair share of trying moments where there were definitely some really noticeable lapses in the mounting tension - But, overall, this film's story-line clearly had some fairly intelligent thought put into it which I'd say easily raised it head and shoulders above all of the other ""PG-13"" junk that's out there."

","In case you're wondering: No. You do not need to see the original ""Cloverfield"" to understnad this movie. In fact, they're completely different. You can watch one or the other on its own and still enjoy them. It's going to be really hard to write this review without giving too much away (and trust me, you want to go in knowing nothing about this film.) but I'm going to try. This isn't really a ""horror"" movie, per se. It's more of a post-apocalyptic thriller. The story is intriguing, but I was expecting a little bit more out of this. It's still a very intense movie, though. John Goodman did a terrific job. I'm glad to see him finally branching out of his typical ""nice guy"" schtick. He's anything but nice here. In fact, he's absolutely terrifying. Watching the movie, I felt very intimidated by him. While I do say that the first ""Cloverfield"" was better, this is still pretty good. Just watch them as 2 different movies where the only thing they have in common is the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title. It works as its own standalone movie, which very few directors can do.

","Like a fast-food meal for the mind, this film is slickly assembled, mildly tasty and composed of utterly manufactured elements that contain only the barest quantity of real nourishment.<br/><br/>Treading over very similar ground to numerous other confinement stories, and positioned as a largely in-name-only sequel to the JJ Abrams' found-footage monster flic, the nudgingly titled 10 Cloverfield Lane has a solid cast, sharply written (if episodic and predictable) script and a clean, stylish look, but - much like the subsequent The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) - in the final analysis it simply can't escape the impression that it is an wholly unrelated story that has been hastily modified and had a title slapped on it to shoehorn its narrative into an contrived franchise relationship with the earlier film.<br/><br/>For most of its length, its an effectively staged post-apocalyptic survival picture; as the possibly PTSD suffering, conspiracy-believing, doomsday-planning survival nut, who rescues/kidnaps and browbeats a young woman and a farm hand who helped him build his bomb shelter, John Goodman gives a fine portrayal of quietly spoken, barely repressed insanity, a bit like a shell-shocked Alex Jones (although with a far greater sense of wounded dignity). The other characters are stock and under-developed but ably served by competent work from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr.<br/><br/>Though very well produced and tightly directed, the film never really gets going; hampered by a limited budget and PG-13 rating, we never get much of a sense of the destruction we're told has been wrought in the world above, aside from one effective sequence where a lone survivor attempts to enter the shelter from above. Having established the claustrophobic setting and ambiguous anti-hero, the film quickly quickly runs out of ideas, and ultimately resorts to an ill-advised action finale - clearly tacked on at the producer's request - which negates much of the previous built-up tension and tips the whole enterprise into clumsy self-parody.<br/><br/>In the end it's neither the intelligent confinement thriller it could have been, nor an imaginative or logical continuation of the Ahbrams picture, but a curious hybrid assembly that adds up to considerably less than the sum of its parts."

","A girl is driving; apparently she had just broke up with her boy friend and she gets a call from him, and just when she is looking at who's calling she crashed and the car turned uncontrollably until she found herself in a bunker underground with her right leg bandaged kinda. She wants to get out bu the capturer tells her that she can't because there'd been an attack and the fallout obliterated everything. Air is contaminated and she's lucky to have been saved by him. The girl found another guy with her also in on the story. The girl hit the man with a bottle and tried to escape but just when she has opened the locks a woman shows up on the glass window of the door, exhibiting a burned face that is attributed, the capturer claims, to the unbreathable air outside. She gives up after she saw for herself that the capturer was actually honest and he indeed helped her. After getting used to their situation with her acquaintance, and the capturer. A air filtration system stops and the man ask the girl to climb into the duct and pass the incline to the place where she'd have to turn the handle of the system off on off and then on again in order so that the system resumes working. The girl discovered at that little room she is at now that there is a stair to a room above. She climbs the stair and found a window to the outside. She was shocked when she discovered the word help etched into the window from the inside and also two earrings that she later come to the conclusion belong to the man's daughter. She explained her findings to the guy but he told her that no this is not the man's daughter,, it is some other girl that disseapeared in his school for two years or skipped town and never got back. Upon this revelation, The guys got what is happening and began concocting a scheme to escape, namely make a suit that will help them outside against the contaminated air. When the man found out , the young man took responsibility and said that it was his idea and told the man to leave the girl out of it . HE apologized but the man shot him on the spot. From then on, The girl is in shock. She saw how her friend has been put in acid after he was shot and she took it upon herself to escape this doom situation. She fought with the man and pushed the acid barrel where he was lying. He then tried to grab her leg when she was fleeing through the duct but the girl got away and now she is outside. She was oblivious to what was waiting for her. She sees a ship in the horizon coming toward her but then it changed hr direction . It turns out that there has been a alien attack and the aliens ship was spreading the contaminated gas all over and there was already aliens on the ground attacking people. When Michelle got into the car the car was lifted by one of the aliens ship/monster and the girl got the idea to burn a wine bottle and throw it into the main mouth hole of the monster and she succeded in blowing it up . Now she is in her car driving again and suddenly the radio signal is revived and asking people to take shelter and if there is any one with experience in combat or can help medically to head for Huston where the attack has not been reined in yet as in the other regions.

"Turfseer","7","0","1","22 November 2018"," Creepy conspiracy theorist is right for once in this entertaining ""Twilight Zone-like"" thriller
","10 Cloverfield Lane is aptly named a ""psychological horror film"" in Wikipedia. It's akin to a good Twilight Zone episode and features some top notch performances.<br/><br/>
Nonetheless, the film starts off on shaky footing. We're introduced to the protagonist Michelle, played by a gritty and convincing Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She's just broken up with her boyfriend and gets into a terrible car accident, only to find herself waking up in an underground bunker, where she's chained to a bed by a creepy conspiracy theorist Howard, played equally convincingly by John Goodman.<br/><br/>
It's not exactly very compelling that Howard has chained Michelle to a bed but the restraints aren't tight enough to prevent her from getting to her belongings on the other side of the room and ultimately fashioning a weapon from a crutch, which she uses to attack him.<br/><br/>
What's more, at one point she sets a fire to draw Howard into the room to attack him without thinking that she might be overcome first by the smoke.<br/><br/>
And why doesn't Howard tell her right away what's going on? Obviously the film scenarists want you to believe that Howard intends to keep Michelle as a sex slave or perhaps end up torturing her.<br/><br/>
When we finally do find out why Howard keeps Michelle prisoner, the sci-fi twist is introduced. Howard claims that he's protecting her as there has been an invasion (possibly by aliens) up above on the surface and they'll need to stay in the bunker indefinitely.<br/><br/>
The idea that Michelle is being kept as some kind of sex slave loses credence when we discover that there's a third person in the bunker: one Emmett, a young man who claims he's worked for Howard doing odd jobs in the past. Emmett also believes earth has been invaded as he witnessed an unexplained explosion prior to gaining safe refuge with Howard.<br/><br/>
Michelle finally becomes convinced that Howard is on the level after climbing through a narrow vent (she's the only one who can do that due to her size) in order to repair a malfunctioning air pump. While in this secluded area of the bunker, she is startled by a desperate woman on the outside who appears to have lesions on her face and is pounding on the window to get in. Michelle ultimately doesn't allow the woman in and now believes Howard's claims that something dreadful indeed has occurred on the earth's surface.<br/><br/>
The tension is further exacerbated after Michelle discovers that a young woman whom Howard refers to as his daughter is actually another woman who disappeared two years prior. While Howard's conspiracy theories about space aliens might be true, it's also become apparent that indeed Howard is a dangerous sexual predator.<br/><br/>
Michelle's determination to escape the bunker reaches its apotheosis after Howard shoots Emmett to death after realizing that he's been plotting to stop Howard and escape with Michelle.<br/><br/>
You can probably guess that Michelle does indeed escape, killing Howard in the process. Nonetheless, there is still a third act here which turns this film into sci-fi and not only as part of a horror genre.<br/><br/>
Yes indeed there are actual bad looking aliens attacking humans on the earth's surface and Michelle narrowly escapes being done in by one who's piloting a space ship. It's all a little bit hokey but following the entertaining saga with Howard, one feels satisfied that the ultimate question as to how truthful Howard has been with all his conspiracy theories, has been answered.<br/><br/>
If you're not too busy, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an entertaining diversion. Goodman as the creepy Howard is right on the mark and Winstead as the intrepid Michelle will make feminists proud! If you like Twilight Zone, this story is certainly a decent enough approximation."

","I haven't realized that there were sequels to the questionable Cloverfield until I've watched The Cloverfield Paradox, and, while that movie doesn't deserve a particular review and could be summed up with ""Mediocre, but passable"" - this one really, really shocked me. In a bad way. What was the point of this movie?<br/><br/>Okay, the original Cloverfield has found footage, lots of CGI, franchise-setting aliens(years before Pacific Rim), some hero interaction, some hero action, but, of course, all within the ridiculously panned out camera capture. Still, it was ""original"". Cloverfield Paradox, again, tries to at least... add to the story. Somehow. It... tries, something already seen many times before, but still tries.<br/><br/>What is ""this""? Mystery? How the hell is it a mystery? Horror? Eh...drama? That's a two hours worth of cheap sound effects that start nowhere, go nowhere and end up nowhere. That's what.<br/><br/>So what do we have? Apparently a basic b*. Who is running away... or something. Who has an accident, wakes up, finds herself hurt(duh) and... guess what... taken care of! With medical stuff and even a leg brace. And... that she is shackled to the wall. What's her first reaction? Well, most adequate people would probably call out, or at least analyze the situation. Because maybe whoever took care of her - doesn't want her to wander around, just like nobody wants patients to run around form the hospital. Pretty basic stuff. What does she do? All kinds of idiocy. All to find out that the mysterious savior... brought her food. Instead of any kind of normal exchange, she goes out like she is in some Saw movie: ""Please, please, don't hurt me"". Damn, the b* deserves to be done right there. But - the man gives her the crutches and the key... tells her to get accustomed. Wow. Okay. So how does she react? She sets off a fire alarm, sharpens the edge of a crutch and tries to assault the man. Wow. Hilarious. Injured, debilitated, hungry, not knowing ""anything"" - she tries to take out the man, who clearly tries to keep her alive. This is some JarJar Abrams level of script here. I bet the director asked: ""So how the duck am I supposed to shoot that bull?"" And the answer was: ""Oh... come on... make it mysterious or scary or something. This is the best we've got and the franchise needs milking, so unless you don't want you paycheck, you better think of a way to make it happen. Don't worry about the audience. If they were dumb enough to like Cloverfield, they aren't going to complain"".<br/><br/>Anyhow, over the next hour we find out that there is another guy, that the situation outside is actually bad, that living inside isn't too bad, yadda-yadda. All would seem reasonable to have a more practical talk by now. Instead... we get a scene, where our Wonder Woman(WW is probably only the 2nd dumbest female in movies, right after this one) crawls to a power room to reset the air conditioning and she finds... Well, supposed evidence that the man, who saved them - is probably lying. Later it goes down the road of Dawn of Justice: ""If there is even 1% chance that he is bad, we HAVE to take that chance!"" So... instead of setting up a controlled situation, where they can confront him... verbally, we get a lot of montage. Which, in the end, results in a pretty forced situation, where the man, who already suffered quite a bit from their presence, finds out that they are planning something. And, in the most fluffy way, the guy decides to take the fall for the girl. And he does that just the right way. Instead of either trying a lie, or at least saying something plausible, he says that was making a ""weapon"", so that he could ""take out"" the man and be ""the hero"" to our girl. Wow. The level of stupidity here has surpassed 9000. So, it's supposed to be a shock that the man straight up shoots him.<br/><br/>From there on, the movie gets to the worst part - the most forced and unlikely escape, some alien activity outside, our girl single-handedly taking out an alien spaceship and braving out to help the people in hospital. Because she is, apparently, a clothes designer, who managed to do a few tiny stitches and who just got balls enough to go Ripley.<br/><br/>I don't even know why I give this two stars. Maybe because the heroes tried to act... particularly the anti-hero. He really carried this movie. And because it's a Cloverfield movie and I was dumb enough to watch it for that. Because there are no redeemable qualities in this movie. No plot, no lore, no franchise ties, nothing. It's a horrible, unthinkable, C-level script that got the funding, the greenlight and the franchise name in the title. It could literally be the worst movies of late, if it was some indie movie. You just change the finale slightly, ever so slightly, and 90% of the movie can stay EXACTLY the same.<br/><br/>
In the end, we find out that the man was indeed a bit paranoid. And had a quarrel with his wife. Yes, apparently it wasn't the wife, who took the daughter. It was him. Absolutely common case of denial. And now he wanted to save another girl, clearly SAVE, and raise instead. Yes, he didn't want that guy in there, but... as long as he behaved, he wasn't an issue. Some time could've gone by, they could've bonded, he may even have seen reason. If they would all get cleared and try to escape the house, fighting off aliens and trying to get to the survivors - I'd give this 6-7\10. Easily. Because if the movie dedicated more time to the actual franchise, whose name it carries, and if it had the script that made even the basic modern level of stoned sense - it could, again, be passable, if not decent.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movies doesn't do it. Doesn't do anything. It spits on you, it sits on you, it wastes your time, trying to exaggerate every possible situation, make every possible mistake and in the end - force the most predictable outcome. This is a clear example of how NOT to write movies. Because, lord be my witness, I've seen more creativity from Paranormal Activity parodies. The dirty and explicit ones. Ugh...."
"a_chinn","8","0","1","15 October 2017"," Winstead is terrific in this tight thriller that keeps you guessing.
","A crackerjack of a film that keeps the audience guessing from beginning to end. Co- written by Damien Chazelle, who wrote and directed La La Land, and produced by J.J. Abrams, who produced the other ""Cloverfield"" movie about a giant Godzilla-like creature attacking NYC. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a very different kind of story about Mary Elizabeth Winstead knocked unconscious in a car wreck only to find herself locked in an underground shelter by John Goodman, who tells her there has been some kind of incident or outbreak out in the world and that they must remain in the bunker to stay safe. Is she a prisoner? Is Goodman her savior or completely insane? Does she risk trying to escape, angering Goodman or facing the unknown outside? John Gallagher Jr. plays a third character also confined to the bunker, similarly brought there by Goodman and unsure if he's been saved or is a prisoner. These types of bottle-stories, with a group of characters confined to a small space, whether it's high art with ""Death and the Maiden"" or whether it's exciting pulp as with something like ""The Thing,"" are incredibly fun when they are done well and this one is done amazingly well. Winstead is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses after this and following a great performance in season three of ""Fargo"" (along with discovering her singing career with Dan the Automator in ""Got a Girl""). Goodman is terrific in his ambivalent performance where you cannot figure out if he's a devil or an angel. Directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who seems to have not made anything else of note before of after this, tightly directs the film, building incredible suspense at times, while also giving time for the characters to become fully fleshed out. SPOILER ALERT! I felt the film did go a bit off the rails at the end when Winstead does finally escape and she has to fight off giant space monsters. Don't get me wrong, it's all very fun, but it felt like I'd suddenly stepped into another film. It may conceptually be an interesting ending in that it ties this to a larger J.J. Abrams Cloverfield universe, but this film taken on it's own, it felt strange and unnecessary, especially considering how small and confined a majority of the film was to then suddenly get dropped into the middle of a giant Michael Bay Transformers movie (though maybe that was the intent). Still, ""Cloverfield 10 Lane"" is an exciting, suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat kind of film that is a must see for fans of this sort of film. If you enjoy this type of set up, I'd recommend Xavier Gens' horror/thriller ""The Divide"" about a group of survivors in a fallout shelter after a nuclear attack, although I have to warn you it's a pretty rough ride."

","PROS: To start off, the build up of tension in this movie was so well placed. There were places where the intensity was at a low, and this allowed for a deeper look into the characters that you wouldn't normally see in a horror movie. You would watch something take place and it would build and build until the climax, then there would be a beautiful compilation of character development and depth to the plot. This was all wrapped up by a masterful ending. As the watcher you want and ending that leaves you with questions but still gives you some answered, and it's the directors job to decide what questions are OK to be unanswered. This movie was the perfect balance of good acting and good directing. <br/><br/>CONS: Although I liked the ending I felt it was very out of the realm for what should be expected. I like how the movie connects to it's films relative, I just didn't expect it and for some people it could've been too unpredictable for their liking.<br/><br/>www.chorror.com"

It was very harmonic with the movie and was a huge asset to me liking the movie if i am honest. The director,the scenario, and of course the acting was other elements non the less that also amazed me and kept me on the edge of my seat. John Goodman delivers an Oscar worthy performance with such a complex character and so much details in the character and no time to build it up but he did it all and delivered me the complete feeling of the character. Marry, i didn't see her before this in anything but this was so good too very much into the survivor character. The only thing that wasn't good for me was the last 20 minutes ""the aliens part"". I mean it is a good thing for endings to be ""not see that one coming"" type but this was so far and i accepted it but there must have been any good build up to lead to it not just throw it to the watchers and hoping they accept it.Though,i liked her decision at the end where she decides to fight that was good. Overall it was a good movie just didn't like the ending that much but yet a new idea and good movie to watch. 7.5/10"

She stays in the bunker with Goodman and workman John Gallagher Jr. (who believes Goodman and fought to get in), not sure which way the preponderance of evidence really points.

","This movie is greet. 10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.<br/><br/>First of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan movies would lose all interest.<br/><br/>I was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and surprising finale. The direction is amazing and claustrophobic. The performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman. The story is gleefully unapologetic delivering chills and full blooded twists (the biggest of all is the intense ending reveal) even thought it deviates from the monster.<br/><br/>Secretly made, impeccably marketed, nicely developed and finally here along with us: 10 Cloverfield Lane promised thrills and delivered it and then some. I was expecting some things that I tasted but I was surprised by a complexity and a twisted sense of horror that I didn't see coming. 2016 has released the very first great movie of the year."

The story leading up to the ending was not one sufficient to prepare anybody for such an ending, changing the entire movie from suspense to sci-fi in one go.

","The first thing I have to say is that the acting in the movie is phenomenal. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Gallagher Jr., and John Goodman all did an amazing job in the movie and were perfectly cast. I really love the plot of the film, the setting being an underground shelter and only three people throughout the entire film. It really added to the mood and suspense that is the apocalypse outside. Howard(Goodman) rescues both Michelle (Winstead) and Emmett (Gallagher) and takes them to an underground shelter who both realize after a while that Howard is holding them captive after making unsuccessful attempts to see what is going on outside. The music in this film is also perfectly made adding to the tone. One of the best suspense films in years."
"Icedooitle","8","0","1","16 April 2017"," The Fabled, Dialed-Down Sequel
","In the months before its release, there was a resurgence of rentals and purchases of 2008's Cloverfield. As with any anticipated sequel, the mentality follows that you will be lost if you aren't fresh on the original. After seeing 10 Cloverfield Lane, I truly wished I had not seen the original first. Note, I say ""first"", not that I regret ever having seen Cloverfield. This is a special sequel, where the less you know, the more effective it is. This is a high praise. We know from the original that there is an alien invasion. There are suggestions of global impact, but the found footage element kept things intimate, perhaps the film's greatest strength. Seeing a bridge demolished by a monstrous claw with 500 helpless civilians screaming can't carry the weight of seeing 5 people we care about in danger. Subject matter like this begs for sequels to raise the stakes; more destruction, wider carnage, higher casualties. Therefore it is unprecedented that 10 Cloverfield Lane shoots for more intimate, with 3 people we can't look away from.<br/><br/>I may have painted myself into a corner here. The less you know the better so I will follow the lead of the well edited trailer. At the 15 minute mark of the film, I noted that I had seen everything the preview had unveiled. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a 20- something driving down a dark country road. She is alternating her attention from scratchy but ominous radio broadcasts, to a voicemail from a pleading boyfriend. A car approaches from the opposite direct and following a few screeches and flashes of light, Michelle awakens in a concrete cell. Her leg is bound and she has two lines leading to her; an I.V., and an ankle chain. She sees a small mattress, her belongings, and a large steel door. After a moment, a gruff John Goodman opens the chamber and enters. He is cryptic, brash, and solemn. From this moment on, we are making up our mind about his intentions. She leaves her cell, freely, and finds she is part of a bigger prison, a bunker. Another captive, John Gallagher Jr, lounges without any sense of skepticism to their situation. It is explained that the air outside is deadly, for reasons unknown.<br/><br/>If the first Cloverfield adds to this film in any way, it is to add weight to the possibility that the bunker is a sanctuary, not a prison. We know what could be waiting outside, and we allow the setting to make its case. There is no diegetic music to suggest anything beyond what we are seeing. The setting holds all the implications we need, ping-ponging between surprisingly homey and claustrophobic. The tension and relief of this mood is hinged on the performance by Goodman, who is equally capable of playing a lovable oaf and a menacing antagonist. You'll have fun making up your mind every step of the way"

"martax9","4","0","1","1 January 2017"," Nice story-line and performances but a disappointing ending
","First of all, I should start this review by stating that I was very excited to see this film. I rarely go to the cinema and this was one of the films I had picked out to see at the cinema which means I liked it very much. <br/><br/>Secondly, the performances were brilliant which was an important aspect of this film since it featured only a few actors which were also the protagonists. Its claustrophobic theme was breathtaking: you were feeling for the 3 people and could sympathize with all 3 of them, even though you didn't know if they were actually nice or disturbed. <br/><br/>The film was indeed a roller-coaster ride. You were led to believe that the ''abductor'' was a kind guy who just wanted to help, then you find out that he has probably abducted other women and killed them so he must be crazy and then, the twist at the end informs you that you should have believed him and that he didn't want to hurt you (as much) after all.<br/><br/>But, I rated this film with 4 out of 10 stars because the ending, although I did not expect it, involved aliens which made the film sci-fi, which was not the reason I wanted to watch it. On the contrary, I was expecting another genre and I didn't like that kind of transformation. Plus, the aliens that seemed to be very powerful at first, eventually retreat when the female protagonist -in the heat of the moment, tired, shocked and scared- attacks them with what? A bottle? <br/><br/>In conclusion, the ending came of as sketchy and sloppy, as if they had wasted the film's minutes building up the suspense and then they ran out of time, so they just surprised us with some aliens and a very cheap solution so that the female protagonist can survive."

","The story is intriguing from the very beginning of the movie. What I liked the most in general is that you have no clue what will happen next. I quickly noticed a resemblance with the story of series Wayward Pines. The accident, life saved by a stranger, suspicious intentions, incomprehensible circumstances... You just put yourself in the same position and it does not feel comfortable. It is hard to trust anyone and you feel curious about the life outside the borders. How could we ever know what is it like to lose everything we had and to be forced to forget about everything we know about our world in only a matter of hours? I must confess that I am a bit disappointed with the ending, probably because I am not really into Mystery and Sci-Fi. Anyways, it didn't ruin the whole story, it just made it a lot more interesting to think about and surely a lot more shocking."

","First of all, unlike the original Cloverfield, you can feel 60% of JJ Abrams influence in this movie. The dialogue, camera angle shot, and even the terrible CGI(like The Force Awakens), you can see JJ's touch.<br/><br/>All three main casts delivered a unique performance that matched with this movie tone. I can't say their acting is good, but somehow good acting isn't required for this movie. They are very fun to watch, especially Emmet's Gallager. And Bradley Cooper, although we can only hear his voice in this movie, surprisingly it sounds very convincing and contributing a portion of significant role in this movie.<br/><br/>Right from the start, we hardly able to guess what will happen in the next scene. And the scene when Howard killed Emmet is the biggest unexpected moment of all(remember Kylo Ren killed Han Solo?). That is very JJ Abrams trademark.<br/><br/>I know there were various alternate ending, but why they chose this version of ending I think is pretty understandable, that they tried to avoid another additional characters to be involved. Good movie though. Oh, Mary E. Winstead is so sexy in this, and a little bit fat."

","To be honest, I didn't know this film was a sequel to the film ""Cloverfield"". I know these two films have similar titles but I guess I didn't put two and two together. From what I can remember from ""Cloverfield"", ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was a little better. ""10 Cloverfield Lane didn't really rely on huge special effects, breath taking CGI and jumping out of your seat scares to maintain an interesting story. The story-line and plot of this film was constructed on pure suspense, drama, and mystery. In a lot of ways that can be scarier than having an actual alien or monster in the film and that's what made this film what it was, also it takes a talented writer to write a tense and suspenseful story that takes place in one small confined area for at least 95% of the film. This film fits right up there with ""Locke"", ""Phone Booth"", and ""Wrecked"". With the mystery of John Goodman's character, Howard, the two other sheltered or captive individuals, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr., have to wonder rather or not to trust the man that ""rescued"" them and that's basically what the plot is but from that a powerful story emerges."

"joeravioli","9","0","1","11 September 2016"," A bundle of massively entertaining scenarios squashed unceremoniously into one
","JJ Abrams called 10 Cloverfield Lane a ""spiritual successor"" to Cloverfield, which proved to be one of the most subtle anti- spirituality comments made so far this year. In case you weren't aware, ""spiritual"" is actually Abrams-speak for ""not at all"". Just as ""new"", in relation to his addition to the Star Wars canon, actually meant ""rehashed and served on a glistening chrome platter"". In any case, don't trust Abrams, mega-multi-muchacho filmmaker though he is. Trust me instead.<br/><br/>All the pieces of 10 Cloverfield Lane are really quite good. Each thrills sufficiently, and manages to provide substantial and effective suspense accompanied by excellent performances and solid direction by debut filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg. Despite taking on a high-concept approach, Trachtenberg never overwhelms his narrative, a feat given how often great concepts are squashed by vapid stories nowadays. However, when taken as a whole, the film feels curiously haphazard. Segments lack continuity, and the final fifteen minutes are akin to duck feet on a grizzly bear. As far as an under-budgeted claustrophobic thriller goes, it passes with flying colours as a prime example of gold- standard entertainment, but its strange construction makes it difficult to recommend.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as Michelle, who finds herself in a doomsday shelter with two men after a car accident. Although one of the men, Emmett, is the definition of harmlessness, Howard, played by John Goodman, is much more sinister. Howard is the man who built the shelter and brought Michelle there. He serves as the rough, taciturn authourity figure who sees all and knows all, acting supposedly in the best interests of the three members of his tiny, underground world. But Michelle isn't about to follow him without question. She immediately decides that all she wants to do is escape. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most terrifying part of the film is not what's out there, but what's inside. Howard himself is a menacing, idiosyncratic figure who maintains his authourity with a thick ring of keys, a gun, and an iron fist. And yet, he may be not all that he seems. Michelle senses this right off the mark, fuelling her desire to escape. Thus begins their deliriously entertaining game of cat and mouse that plays tricks on our senses with creaks, thumps, and the occasional nasty shock. What makes it all the more terrifying is how frustratingly small the shelter is. A potent sense of claustrophobia is invoked within the viewer, as Michelle plots away against Howard behind his back, but without any knowledge of where that hulking, flabby back might be. <br/><br/>While it's the suspense that drives the film, what elevates it beyond an uncommonly effective thriller are the remarkable performances by each of its three leads. Mary Elizabeth Winstead makes it easy to root for her character. Not only is she especially vulnerable as a woman living with two strange men, she's also an unprecedented badass with more tricks up her sleeve than a professional magician. John Gallagher Jr., while serving as the standard ""nice guy"" character who offsets Howard's incessant humorlessness, provides the film's emotional foundation. <br/><br/>John Goodman is absolutely petrifying, a villain disguised as a hero. His primary demeanour is that of unfathomable coldness, but his temper tantrums come frequently and with little provocation. In a way, he's a perverse father figure, the guy you spent your childhood tiptoeing around for fear of a beating. Shrouded in mystery, but with enough revealed to make us question his intentions, we spend much of the film guessing as to who Howard truly is beyond a lumbering source of jump scares. <br/><br/>The film's ending is without a doubt the weirdest thing I've seen in a film all year. It isn't surreal or artsy -- common sources of weirdness, but it arrives like a bolt from the blue, a massive contrast with what came before. I've committed to no-spoiler reviews, so I won't tell you exactly what happens. Chances are that you won't like it, but I did. In fact, I loved it. I found it extremely satisfying, and, well, a pretty gosh darn awesome fifteen minutes of pure exhilaration accompanied by a wonderfully climactic finale and a perfect resolution to Michelle's character arc.<br/><br/>Only problem is, it's tangential. The story is segmented by this strange turn of events, which has little, if anything to do with what came before. In any film, unless it's an artistic choice -- which I'm sure Abrams would insist -- a lack of continuity is a major, major problem.<br/><br/>Too many people call 10 Cloverfield Lane a JJ Abrams film. Sure, he produced it. But anyone who knows anything about JJ Abrams should also know that he isn't able to do something like this. Abrams' films are big stories with big budgets meant to be viewed on big screens, and no, Super 8 isn't an exception. So to put 10 Cloverfield Lane's pen in Abrams' hand is a travesty indeed, because to do so negates Trachtenberg's surprising feat: He has created a small story with a small budget, but one that thrills, chills, and spills on a massive scale."

Now why I say the first one was much more superior was because it was faster in terms of pace and action, the mystery and suspense was much better, and the story had more atmosphere of hopelessness and intrigue. Here in the 2016 follow-up, the story follows three characters trapped in a house with chaos going on in the outside world which we never see and the whole time you're sitting there thinking ""Ok, anytime now for the action. I don't care how deeply torn these characters are or what their motivation is. I want to see some action"" or ""how many more minutes until this movie ends?"" The director bit many parts from current filmmakers in this one. From the beginning, I noticed Zack Snyder's 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" opening so I wasn't really excited there. Then James Wan's ""Saw"" was also thrown into the mix so the mystery just couldn't be more obvious: a girl is trapped in a house...but why!? No surprises or thrills in this one.

Makes no sense. (2) If the Earth is really under attack, there would be evidence from within the bunker. E.g. emergency radio broadcast, the disappearances of normal radio stations, or frantic CB radio messages. A well prepared survivor like Howard should have those items. Why would he not show the evidence to Michelle, knowing she is skeptical? And why is Howard not aware that Michelle would be skeptical, after he locked her up?<br/><br/>When Michelle finally escape out of the bunker, she is greeted by aliens attacking the Earth. That's a surprise, because up to that time the movie tried to make us believe Howard is lying. Unfortunately, this surprise is kind of forced. It is not logical, but made that way just for the pure purpose of surprising the audience. And after the surprise wears off, the movie come to an end abruptly.<br/><br/>There is also a lot of fluff in the movie. Whenever people are telling each other their life stories, I fast forward.<br/><br/>In short, this movie builds up suspense and then gives an off the wall twist to surprise you. But with no good story line to support the twist."

","just watched the movie and i gotta say how the hell this movie has rating of 7.3? you failed me again IMDb. While it has some good acting the plot is garbage and movie think its being clever while in fact is being silly. characters make retarded choices and you don't buy into this silly willy plot that they came up with. So there are three of us in this bunker and we know for a fact that one is crazy and has killed before,so what we are going to do is plan for escape from this bunker with the crazy murderer guy who trust us and we could take his gun away at any point or just kill him in any other way,because you know,THERE IS TWO OF US,but instead lets wait for one of us to get killed for the sake of the plot. And to top it of our main hero girl has one of the worst lines in a movie i have seen for a very long time where she sees the aliens and goes ''come on''."

","If you wanted an alien invasion movie, you probably hated this movie until the last 10 minutes. If you wanted a Panic Room style thriller, you probably liked most of it but thought the ending was ruined. I actually thought it was good up until the last 10 minutes. You don't know whether Goodman was just a crazed captor or he was telling the truth. Hints of him abducting another woman before. Is he lying? Did he somehow poison his neighbor and that explains the ""diseased woman"" outside the door? Will Michelle escape and find Ben and others looking for her (and there was no attack) and Goodman was just a nut in a bunker? I would have preferred that ending.<br/><br/>Instead of a plausible ending that is an eyebrow raiser, we get 10 (or maybe 5) minutes of alien invasion scenes, Michelle blowing up an alien craft with a bottle of hooch, getting sprayed by chemicals and somehow an improperly sealed (and not always worn) helmet with water bottle filters protects her. To me, it just felt like it was a thriller up until the last 10 minutes and then they decided to morph it into a cheesy alien flick to get an ending.<br/><br/>Get creative Hollywood! Could have been a remote farm town and after some weeks (months) not hearing from some residents, they check into it and it turns out Goodman had taken his crop duster and poisoned his neighbors. Michelle could have even been greeted by people in hazmat suits, making Goodman's story look plausible at first, until the authorities tell Michelle that the area was contaminated and it took some time for them to get in and do a thorough search on the ground (when they found her). Then the whole movie is explained by a crazy doomsday prepper who captured two people and staged his own ""doomsday"". Anything would have been better than the alien ending!"

","I had reasnnonably positive expectations about this flick and, of course, I was disappointed. The story's been told several times over and most of the action is utterly predictable - except for the one big question at the beginning, granted, for which we get a first answer, then a twist and yet another twist. The problem with this film is that it tries to be two things at the same time, in just 94 minutes. * SPOILERS!! * There's what happens inside, and what happens outside. So there's first a kind of a thriller, and then a kind of an action/SciFi film. The two parts just don't add up. The movie would have been much better if it had chosen to be either the first, or the second kind. Here, it's just insufficiently convincing in both attempts. Oh and we have about 15 minutes of action taking place completely in the dark in the second part so you actually have no clue about what's causing the shouting and screaming. In one word : disappointing."

","The first half of this movie is exceptional as it manages to recapture magic from other films like Saw, Hostile, Wild Things, and Old Boy. Being that this film is a Psychological Thriller (for the 1st half anyway) you as the viewer will naturally start trying to figure out what is real, who the main character can trust, and what are all the different possibilities that could true from the very conflicting information exchanged by the characters in the film. Just when you believe you have figured out what is really going on, there is a scene which occurs that will prove you otherwise, which is exactly what you want from A well put together Psychological Thriller. I will briefly go over how the film begins and how it transitions.<br/><br/>The opening scene shows our main Character ""Michelle"" (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) an attractive short haired brunette, driving down a stretch of road but quickly becomes involved in a strange accident, with an invisible object it would seem. <br/><br/>Michelle wakes up in a dreary, unfamiliar place resembling of a dungeon and holding cell. This has a strong vibe from the movie Saw as she looks down to discover that she is restrained from being able to move far which causes her to have an immediate flight reaction, desperately trying to break her restraint and then discovers her leg is injured from the crash she was in (but seemingly does not recollect)<br/><br/>""Howard"" (played by John Goodman) is introduced into the scene as he opens the steal reinforced door to greet Michelle and give her food and water. Michelle desperately tries to figure out Howard's motive but he is very vague with her and says he just wants her to get better. He does try to win her trust by explaining he saved her from a crash and brought her to what is his underground bunker because of an apocalyptic like attack that has occurred. Again, Howard is vague in explaining all of this, which is the norm for him. It is easy to know from Michelle's body language that she does not believe any of this being told to her and she is going to make a run for it when the first chance shows itself. <br/><br/>After Michelle's leg felt better she leaves the room that she had awoke in and runs into the last main character ""Emmett"" (played by John Gallagher Jr.) A young country man who is simple minded and a little slow. When Michelle is able to speak with Emmett privately, she begs for his help to escape, but what he tells her baffles her and is the true start of this Psychological thriller which is full of unexpected twists and turns up until the very end.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved how this film made me believe that I knew generally where it was going only to completely decimate my theory (3 times) as the movie progressed. The chemistry between Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman is just pure greatness in some of the more suspenseful scenes. The amount of these type of scenes definitely give the movie a serious and uneasy type vibe which manages to stay consistent for the most part, however there was a couple scenes which were very ""off track"" and did not vibe well with the tone and nature of the film. One of the scenes I am referring to just came off as too forced and overexagerated, which caused it to be more like dark comedy instead of suspense, which was unfortunate because this really could have been an epic scene just by toning it down. Not long after this out of place scene came some big reveals. As the movie revealed more and more truths about some of the mysteries my on edge excitement quickly turned into huge disappointment. I honestly don't know if there was ever a movie I had watched before where I transitioned from loving it to hating it so fast! So for me the ending was too over the top and ridiculous, which caused me to lose interest rather fast once I knew for sure what was truly happening. The movie is still very unique however and has some very memorable scenes executed well by the cast so I do recommend it and believe it is worth the watch but just should have, would have, could have been great movie."

","Can't really pick out anything poor in this.<br/><br/>Goodman's character was a bit of a departure for him. I guess the closest would be Hudsucker Proxy. He's a off-kilter jerk, not sure where he's coming from. He looks the part of a kidnapping weirdo, which initially disappointed me for being cliché. <br/><br/>Then after all the drama, he turns into a likable dad who just went overboard after the end of the world. <br/><br/>Finally at the end he's...we're not really sure. It wasn't cliché. Was he a pervert? Did he kidnap the girl as a daughter surrogate? Did he even kill the girl?<br/><br/>I did think that not telling the female lead that it was the end of the world was a device to add conflict and departed from what Goodman's character would have done. But that's forgivable. <br/><br/>All in all, I'd nominate him for an Oscar, maybe in Supporting. Not sure if he should win, though.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure that they played enough with the element of if it really was the end of the world or not. The diseased woman on the other side of the hatch was good, and the supposed cars/helicopters (actually aliens in the end) was good. But---I felt a bit was missing.<br/><br/>Nice scene with the man/woman doing their monologues about their past. Very well done and was a springboard for subsequent turns. <br/><br/>I think I was expecting it not to be the end of the world once the girl escaped, but it was better that it was. It was a quick turn from the tone previously, but provided a solid 15 minute ending. And her arch was nice when she previously established that she runs when things are tough. But at the literal fork in the road, she chooses to drive toward the war. <br/><br/>Very highly recommended."

","Cloverfield (2008) is one of the better found footage horrors, and this is a sequel (of sorts) to that as your probably know.<br/><br/>This is not filmed in the found footage format and also in the first hour you might think to yourself (is this really a sequel to Cloverfield?) because frankly the similarities up to that point are pretty non-existent.<br/><br/>And it's not until a bit later that it starts to resemble a horror even, and plays more as a psychological drama-thriller initially which is a bit peculiar, if this was the first movie or a standalone movie this would have worked great but as a sequel having us wait for that long? I don't know.<br/><br/>Well actually I do know now, after doing a little research.<br/><br/>The script was never meant as a sequel to Cloverfield, JJ Abrams had read it and liked it a lot so he bought the rights for it and simply decided to have it changed so it would fit into the 'Cloverfield universe'... Which is one way to do it I suppose.<br/><br/>Anyways the last 35 minutes are very good and make up for the wait, but as a whole which one should always judge a movie by is far from fantastic...

","**** May contain strong spoilers ****<br/><br/>This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....<br/><br/>This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.<br/><br/>John Goodman is nearly perfecting the character and lifts the whole movie... his acting is a feast for sore eyes. Because sore eyes this motion picture gave me. Sadly.... I had so high expectations on this one... and about 40 minutes into it it's still slow and just too boring to keep the tension alive.<br/><br/>One thing that really shook things up were the sudden turning off events and also sudden death... just like that. Very emotionally made with close atmosphere there. Story closes in.... grabs hold of me... and there....on the floor...human in acid....did I hear somebody say Cloverfield Robocop?<br/><br/>One thing that the production has done very well is the mysteria around the why and how of the underground living. When things starts to shake and the truth shall be revealed, there is a sudden and immediate impact from the other motion picture of Signs, by Night Shyamalan. Is it this...or is it that? Well.....the questionmark that Signs puts on is almost the size as in 10 Cloverfield Lane. In some ways it was too obvious and too clear to in a magnificent way shake the viewer up. The reason why there is turmoil is cleared up in a fast and almost fearsome way, just to get around again and... oh, no... is it that way?<br/><br/>Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Well made, believable and authentic. Environments and scenery give it a special touch. - The actors : They all... the 3 of 'em is nailing the characters and pushing the story forward. Good and solid! - The story : Well....... seen and heard it too many times. The twist at the end with 2 deaths, explosions and...behold....extra terrestrials, gives the story a kick. - Entertainment : Interesting to watch just to see what the truth is.... that's about all. - Age : 15<br/><br/>5,9 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)"

","Whilst 10 Cloverfield Lane is sold as a sequel, it is not a sequel in the traditional sense. J.J Abrams described it as being a blood relative to Cloverfield, with no direct links existing to its 2008 predecessor. Typically sequels that have nothing to do with the original do not have a good track record often just attempting to capitalise on the reputation of the original without having to put any effort in to creating a good film, such as Home Alone 3 and Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2. But fortunately 10 Cloverfield Lane avoids this, being an effective thriller that stands apart from the original whilst still offering the same kind of horror and looming threat that made the original Cloverfield such a hit. <br/><br/>We open the film with a young woman called Michelle as she is driving away after seemingly breaking off her engagement. There's a few vague mentions on the radio of something going on, but before she can pay this any thought, a car crashes in to her and drives her off the road. She awakes in an empty room chained to the pipe. Eventually a man named Howard (John Goodman) enters the room to tell her that the outside world is no longer inhabitable and that he bought her in to his bunker to save her life.<br/><br/>And that's all that we know. It's this uncertainty and the unknown that casts a lurking shadow across the rest of the film as we, along with Michelle, try to put together exactly what's going on. There's another survivor in the shelter named Emmet (John Gallagher) who seems more trustworthy than Howard and is also convinced that somethings happened, but none of them are sure of just what it is. A few theories are thrown out there regarding Russians, aliens or apocalypse. Throughout the film we're left attempting to figure out exactly what's happened, but we do know that somethings happened and whatever's out there is keeping them trapped inside. <br/><br/>But as threatening as whatever's outside is, our characters never seem that much safer inside with John Goodman's Howard posing an ever looming threat. He's similar to other great villains like Kathy Bates in Misery, with his unhinged nature making him both unpredictable and dangerous, constantly switching in to fits of rage every time one of the other characters talks out of place. And just like whatever has happened outside, throughout the film we're constantly trying to piece together just who he is and whether he was really just trying to save Michelle or if he had some other reason for taking her out from that car wreck. <br/><br/>Whilst Michelle is held in the bunker against her will, she never for one moment becomes a passive victim. She is constantly using her survival instinct and being resourceful to gain an understanding of what's going on and figure out a way that she can get out of there. <br/><br/>Further distinguishing itself from its predecessor, 10 Cloverfield Lane does not use any shaky cam throughout the film. Instead Dan Trachtenberg favours a more suspenseful style of shooting that follows from Michelle's perspective whilst better emphasising the often claustrophobic setting of the film. <br/><br/>It's a thrilling premise that's executed in an unsettling way, trapping us within the same uncertainty and paranoia as our main character. Whilst we don't know exactly what we're supposed to fear, we know that whether it's the monster outside or the monster within, there is constant danger looming."

","Let me start by telling you that I love Mary Winstead. I also really, really enjoyed the previous 'found footage' Cloverfield. It was a fun movie that gets you invested in the characters quickly and does not disappoint with the action and the effects. So, you can imagine why I was worried about the fate of this film. I wanted it to be as good, if not better than the original - a feeling I shared with Prometheus.<br/><br/>It starts off well enough and moves into familiar territory for anyone who has seen the trailers. The movie does what the trailer promises. It builds an atmosphere that switches back and forth between oppressive and relaxed, and then back again so quickly that you get whiplash!! Fun!! <br/><br/>It follows our strong leading lady and we are happy to go along with her. The script seems to be well written with no extra words or actors talking aloud unnecessarily just to explain what happened. I like that. But, the exclamations are there when they feel feasible. I would have probably said the same things. <br/><br/>The plot moves, builds, and takes off a little predictably, but it is still done well enough to have me heaving a sigh or relief. <br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a fitting prequel.

","10 Cloverfield Lane is the sequel to 2008's 'Cloverfield', and follows a young woman stuck in a fallout shelter with two men, one younger, and one older who believes that the world has ended and that they are the last people alive. <br/><br/>The plot isn't horribly unique, but it's presented in a fantastic way. Right from the beginning I knew that it would be great, and it was. It's presented in an interesting way, with the audience questioning it for the entire length. As someone who saw the first Cloverfield I think that I knew the ending, but the story was so intriguing that I didn't even think about that. I found myself questioning it myself, even when I thought about the original. <br/><br/>The characters are amazing. Again, from the start the character of Michelle is set up as a solid character, and I already had a good enough idea of who she was and what she was like just by the first five minutes. This is mostly due to Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance. She was absolutely fantastic in this movie. I wondered if I'd just see 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World's Ramona Flowers the whole time, but thankfully I didn't. But even better than Winstead was John Goodman. Goodman's character was not only deep and interesting, but portrayed in a way where I actually had to think. His character, Howard, is why you question this movie. He's creepy, he's scary, and you really don't know how to feel about this guy. Everything about him is perfect. John Gallagher Jr. delivered a solid performance as Emmett, but not as good as Goodman and Winstead. Not only were the performances great, but the characters were great. They had stories to tell from their lives, and they weren't far fetched or unrelatable. They were interesting and made the characters more lifelike. Some stories, mostly at the beginning, were left untold, but they worked much better that way. Another thing is that Michelle's character wasn't just that attractive and dumb girl in every horror/thriller, she was actually an attractive and smart girl instead. At times I thought that maybe she was too smart, though, but then again, it's not like I'm even close to the smartest person in the world, so who am I to judge someone's intelligence? <br/><br/>This movie is intense. I didn't expect that, but it definitely was. My attention was on this movie at all times, and when something arose I was on the edge of my seat. It's not the most intense movie I've ever seen, but I certainly felt like screaming from time to time. <br/><br/>I've heard people complain about the ending, but I liked it quite a bit. With everything that happened you'd almost expect it. There was one part of the ending that was extremely out of place, however, and that took me out of the moment of the movie a little bit. However, I'm happy with where the movie decided to end. It could have gone longer, but it didn't. <br/><br/>Overall 10 Cloverfield Lane is fantastic. As someone who loved the original Cloverfield, I certainly was not disappointed in the slightest. I'm happy it didn't go for the found footage style like the original did, and I'm happy with how different it was. While one part of the ending was out of place, it ended well for the most part. Who knows? Maybe even on my second watch I'll give it a 10/10 (I wouldn't even be surprised). In the end I would definitely recommend this movie."
"Rob_Taylor","7","0","2","6 May 2016"," No, it really isn't a sequel to Cloverfield. Not at all.
","Okay, before I start, a word about the negative reviews about this film. Most of them seem to fall into a category I'll generously label as ""It said Cloverfield in the title! WTF!"" Said reviews are from people who erroneously assumed it was a sequel to Cloverfield because of the name. It isn't. Nor is it really anything to do with Cloverfield the movie, or that universe. Abrams himself muddied the waters a little and isn't without blame because he called it a ""spiritual cousin"" to the original.<br/><br/>However, what 10 Cloverfield Lane is, is a movie in the same vein, but not at all alike. A bit like Star Wars and Star Trek are both scifi films, but expecting one to be a sequel to the other just because they have the word ""Star"" in them is the height of idiocy. Same deal with this movie. You can safely ignore those reviews because the majority of them are written by disgruntled Cloverfield fans.<br/><br/>Now, on to this film. Is it any good, and what is it really about? Well, it is at its heart a thriller of sorts, with a healthy dose of mystery and ""what the hell is going on?"" thrown in for good measure. With a cast of just three people for the majority of the running time it manages to keep the tension going nicely.<br/><br/>It would be hard to say much more without ruining the movie entirely, but most things are revealed and wrapped up by the end. Whether or not it comes across as satisfying is entirely down to what your expectations are going in and what you are expecting to see (hence my comments about the negative reviews above). If you go in with an open mind, you might just find it more enjoyable and satisfying.<br/><br/>Performances are good throughout, but Goodman is the standout here. Forget his usual lovable rogue routine. He goes to an entirely different place in this film.<br/><br/>The ending is controversial if it isn't what you were expecting, but it is also surprising. I think, ultimately, that using the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title was an attempt to let potential viewers in on the... unusual and unexpected... ending. I think they wanted to not let the cat out of the bag, but just poke it so it mewed a little and gave people an idea of what to expect. Sadly, as note, some people took it too literally and were disappointed as a result.<br/><br/>That's not to say the ending is particularly good. Everything that comes before it is somewhat cheapened by the sudden descent into... action... that ensues, and it is thematically a seemingly tacked on experience. You could quite literally swap out the last ten minutes for any number of other endings and they would all work just as well (or not, depending on your personal liking). The ending that you get, however, is quite striking.<br/><br/>Altogether though, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a thoroughly enjoyable thriller with a few twists that left me happy I decided to watch it. You could do worse.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Decent thriller with a name that left too many expecting the wrong thing. Excellent performance from John Goodman playing against type and with an ending that is a Marmite moment for a lot of people. Worth the effort, however, if only for Goodman's performance."

","Warning: Potential Spoilers!<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for 10 Cloverfield lane, I can't say I was hugely excited after the rather disappointing Cloverfield (2008). This film had been described as not a sequel but simply a ""blood relative"" of the previous Cloverfield film. <br/><br/>Firstly, this film does not adopt the shaky 'found footage' camera style as the previous one which was certainly a relief. It also does not show the creature from the other Cloverfield film which was meant to be similar to Godzilla in terms of its origin story. This was also a relief. <br/><br/>I would have given this film a higher rating had it not been for the ending. I don't want this summary to be super-spoilery so I'll stop short of just telling you what happens but we go from being in a semi- realistic situation that involves three people trying to survive together in a bunker to just complete ridiculousness. The actual reveal at the end isn't in itself awful, it actually could have been rather interesting. However, the way events unfold in the last 15-20 minutes of the film were just moronic and nothing more than a film trying to add some action when it wasn't needed.<br/><br/>I found the suspense and mystery during the majority of the film to be compelling and intriguing but rather than sticking to that style with the ending, I think this film was ruined by an attempt to add excitement and an excuse to use special effects."

","This movie is so much smarter and more complex than your average run of the mill horror movie crap that comes out recently. This film does away with all the disgustingly cheap jumpscares and gives you something much more that many people can relate to. The unnerving emotions of uncertainty, doubt, intimidation, claustrophobia and powerlessness. They are all in this movie and all come from the paranoia that starts to grow between Michelle and Howard, and that you don't know whether Howard is insane or what he claims is actually true. Either way you are scared of this guy because you know he's just not well and is probably a murdering psychopath with severe control issues.<br/><br/>Less is more is the philosophy that drives this movie and I won't dare spoil what happens in this movie since i knew nothing about it going in.

","Michelle walks out of her boyfriend and gets involved in a horrific car accident. When she comes to senses, she finds herself chained to a bed in a room without a window. A big swarthy man, Howard, soon walks in and claims that he has saved her life. They are in a bunker below his farmhouse, he further explains. Apparently there has been a mysterious attack of some kind and the air outside is contaminated. Howard, ex-navy, has spent a lifetime planning and preparing for such an attack and proudly shows around the various facilities in the bunker, which among other things is fitted with a sophisticated air filter system. The bunker has every creature comfort for living luxuriously for a couple of years. There is also another man inside the bunker; the man who helped Howard put it all together. Then there is Megan, an intriguing girl who exists only in a photograph.<br/><br/>While the trio get to know each other, an air of nervousness prevails inside the bunker, as there is no way the situation outside can be ascertained with any degree of certainty. To add to the confusion, they keep hearing some mysterious noises outside. It is edge of the seat stuff. When the air filter system malfunctions Michelle is sent through the narrow duct to fix it. She spots something startling that makes Howard's behaviour highly suspicious. The plot dramatically shifts gears, twice thereafter, leading to a totally unexpected climax. Even the end is very ambiguous and far from clarified.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a brilliantly creative thriller delivering terror at multiple levels – psychological, physical and supernatural.

","Fair warning - some spoilers below, nothing major.<br/><br/>I went to the movie excited by the User reviews IMDb, only to emerge disappointed and somewhat bored. After going in expecting real suspense and significant plot twists, I was disappointed to find that the move was largely predictable and ended in the worst way possible. it's not bad by any means, but it's not good either. while demonstrating great fundamentals, it makes one or two key errors early and late in the film that ruined the overall experience for me.<br/><br/>To break it down a bit - pros - Great direction, Dan made one hell of a theatrical debut with this one. cinematography is awesome as well, creating a a perfect atmosphere of claustrophobia that adds to the suspense. acting is noteworthy, though John Goodman's exceptionally strong performance overshadows Mary E. Winstead and John Gallagher weaker showings a little too much, even if the feeling of dominance is somewhat intentional. There are many spectacular scenes that really carry through with amazing tension. The writers made sound decisions on character development - or the lack thereof - choosing to focus on the action instead of useless exposition and backstory.<br/><br/>cons - Given knowledge of how bottle thrillers typically play out, and with a few key pieces of foreshadowing that occur during early - mid movie, most of the key plot points and character motivations were surprisingly predictable. This is a big no-no for me with thrillers, especially when most of it could have been avoided with just a little more subtlety in the writing.<br/><br/>This would not have completely ruined the film if it were not for the biggest mistake of all - The bloody ending. Seriously, screw the ending. Completely unnecessary plot point that serves only to tie the film into the ""anthology"" universe that's being built around the original ""Cloverfield."" I know that things associated with J.J. Abrams generally have a problem with the concept of ""a hat on a hat"", but i was not prepared for having something so completely non-sequitur to the rest of the film dominate the last 15 min. The name of the film and other foreshadowing points should have prepared me somewhat, but I held out hope that it was really going to be something different, I suppose. It also ripped off the newest War of the Worlds in the last big ""survival moment"" of the entire film, which only served to add insult in injury.<br/><br/>Overall, 10 Cloverfield lane is a solid film that makes a few critical errors which serve to greatly diminish the overall experience. Perhaps the other reviews are correct about going in with less expectation, and other viewers may enjoy the film in spite of what I perceive to be it's main failings, but i really just can't recommend this movie for a theater viewing."

","I finally got to see this film today, a little late with the rest of the world, yet the wait was worth it. Staying away from every possible content regarding this film proved to be one of the best efforts I've made in my cinema-going life. There is no way other way to describe this film than thrilling, a triumph in tension, paranoia and adrenaline, one of those rides that reminds you why going to the cinema is such an experience.<br/><br/>Dan Trachtenberg has a very long and prosperous career ahead of him, this debut is one of the most surprising hits I've had in a long time from a first time director. The confidence with which this film is directed is astounding. The visual storytelling used is incredible when considering the setting and the limits it imposes. Yet the director finds a way to make every scene interesting visually and with the use of classic yet effective editing tricks every scene has a beat and a context made easily palpable thanks to this incredible direction.<br/><br/>Fortunately it does not end there: other than starting off what is a very remarkable script, the movie amongst its very merits has an terrific ensemble cast performance. All of the three are perfect casting. Gallagher Jr. plays what could have been a throw away part with depth, he gives the slightly generically witted characterization a reason and purpose to the point that you buy into him in the first minute of screen time without ever thinking twice about it. Winstead confirms her talent once again with a performance that grounds every element of tension thanks to fantastic blocking and eye movement. Yet, at the center of it all is a class act by John Goodman. This might be his best performance. I know it seems far fetched, but when you think about it the work on display here is immense material. The visual cues he adds to the persona, the paranoia he manages to inject in the film thanks to this almost schizophrenic attitude. And on top of this is a performance which isn't perceived as such as you watch the film, you just look at character for 100 minutes and you never feel like there's an actor in the middle.<br/><br/>All of the above basically sums up to one of the most tense experiences I can remember having in a theater recently. The adrenaline flowed through me was insane. Time and time again I screamed at the screen. It is so well built and organized. It builds and builds constantly, always using every lesson Hitchcok taught us, and culminates in a double finale that took my breath away. This is one of those physical experiences I cherish truly because the tension is so cathartic thanks to really, really good character development and without a doubt a score that deserves incredible praise and merit for the overall achievement.<br/><br/>If it can be blamed for something, trying not to give anything away, that is the confusion that is created by some story elements at the start and end. J.J. could not resist messing this up too. His obsession with mystery is really starting to get on my nerves because he really seems not to understand how it works. I was OK one time he did it, then twice, then again, then with Star Wars and now with this, which unmistakably feels like his meddling in it. Once again for every answer you are given, there is a story beat that opposes it and creates a loop of confusion. I could really start ranting endlessly about J.J. Abrams because he is a director that I really have a hard time getting behind, thankfully Trachtenberg is such a better one and he manages to overcome the majority of this issues by really putting focus on the main arch and themes, sidelining the parts that don't work so not to bother you too much.<br/><br/>This experience was a thrilling dream and I can't recommended it enough in the biggest and darkest cinema possible, you will not be disappointed."

Don't read a description of the plot, don't watch the trailer, nothing. Just go and see it. So I'm not gonna go into detail about the plot of the movie, and just describe my experience.<br/><br/>Right from the get-go, this movie got to me. Intense doesn't even cover it. Beautifully made from every angle - from the camera work to the perfect soundtrack - everything was spot-on.<br/><br/>John Goodman probably delivers his best performance, at least in my opinion. Nuanced, delicate, perfectly balanced - just wonderful. The same applies to Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I loved her character, her resourcefulness, her strength. A delight to watch.<br/><br/>**Spoilers from here on:** The only thing that knocked this movie from a solid 10 to a (still very good) 8, is its ending. I feel like this movie should be 10 minutes shorter. The entire ending - the aliens, the spaceship, that Independence- Day-ending, it just felt like it was taken from a different movie. Why not leave a more open ending? Why give a definitive answer to the question 'Did something really happen'? I found myself thinking - 'Why is this movie still going?' Think about it. How great would it have been had Michelle taken off her home- made gas mask, taken a long breath... roll credits. THAT movie wouldn't have left me for weeks.

","10 Cloverfield Lane exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>After learning of the new approach this film would take in regards to the original ""Cloverfield"", I didn't know what to expect; I imagined it would go the route of ""Rec 3"" and be just another flick. Oh how wrong I was...<br/><br/>This film is an example of how well a film can be made using minimal resources from a financial, and artistic perspective as well. I am unsure of when exactly the film takes place when considering the events of Cloverfield, but it honestly was not something that bothered me, nor something I was left wondering because it is so well done.<br/><br/>The pace is perhaps the part of the film I would like to highlight. The nature of the story called for a very ""enclosed"" setting, and yet the director managed to make it work in a very diligent way. I won't reveal the plot, but the setting and the story would have provided a challenge to any filmmaker because of how they were to be told, but that was no problem here. The pace was just excellent, plain and simple, and the story was nothing short of superb.<br/><br/>Acting, I believe, was also something that stood out. I hadn't seen such a good performance from either Goodman or Winstead, and they delivered flawlessly. In fact, I would say this really brought out some of the best acting skills for both.<br/><br/>The Score is yet another element to be praised. It provided a sense of thrill and fear whenever it was required, and a sense of comfort and warmth whenever it was needed.<br/><br/>I do have a few complaints about the story's 3rd act, which is why I didn't score this film higher than 8. Some things, in my opinion, just could have been better and developed in a different way, especially in the climax. I also think that the chemistry of the characters didn't work in some scenes, which by no means devalues their individual performances, but some things just felt that could have been expanded with a few more minutes of footage.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this flick to any thriller lovers, and those who aren't should enjoy it without hesitation."

","10 Clover field lane is something of a different film. It is a story of that I have never heard before in a film.

The story is interesting and without going into to much, it is a good story with twists and turns throughout. The development of the plot exceeds in the pacing of the film. It paces itself quite well with one or two scenes getting a bit boring and slow but the story revels things in a great fashion. My biggest downside to this film is the ending, I wont say much but it's something to think about for me. The films marketing was very odd yet the film still grossed a lot.

","When 'Cloverfield' came out in 2008, I personally was not a fan at all. I hated the camera work, still hate T.J. Miller (Sorry not sorry), and overall I just did not understand it. However, after viewing '10 Cloverfield Lane' and seeing the (possible) connections to the first one; I now have a new-found appreciation for 'Cloverfield' as I have a love for '10 Cloverfield Lane'. So now where do I begin? We will start at the beginning. 1. The introduction of the title and the directors and producers was fantastically creative to me. All I will reveal for this part is that when the introductions are occurring, it is during the car crash scene as I previously explained in the summary. 2. The straight up unexpected turns and shocking moments keep happening throughout the entire film. As you think or witness one thing, another turn happens to alter the expected timeline every time. 3. John Goodman is eerily creepy, frightening, and fantastic all at the same time. There are moments where you want to love him, want to respect him, then want to see his brains splattered across the confined walls. Regardless, Goodman puts on a show in this one and is wildly effective in regards to the thriller element of this film. 4. and last point, '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a barrage of ""WTF"" moments and curiosity but in the best way possible. Why is this happening? Who is Howard exactly? What is exactly happening? How much time has transpired since the events of 'Cloverfield'? '10 Cloverfield Lane' is playing curiosity perfectly by enticing crowds to take interest in the film and keep them wondering afterward and wanting more. I applaud Abrams and company and I personally am looking forward to the next installment desperately. They created an enticing sci-fi/thriller/mystery/drama all in one mysterious punch and I want more. Check this one out ASAP people if you loved the first Cloverfield or if you just simply love this style.<br/><br/>EDIT To whom it may concern: Just to clear the waters, this installment IS NOT a direct sequel to 'Cloverfield'. It is the same universe but it is not a direct sequel. I stated that there may be possible connections. Regardless, it is a fantastic stand-alone film and I am anxious to see how things may tie together by the time Abrams is green-lit for another installment."

","I enjoyed this movie because it was both entertaining and exciting. The movie was a unique take on a fallout apocalyptic movie. Usually its a classic lineup of a couple strangers somehow fending off aliens or zombies so this was a good take on it. John Goodman once again was great he played his role perfect just like i expected. The whole movie you are wondering whether or not he was a crazy kidnapping psychopath or he was right about the whole attack on the world. In the end he turns out to be both which is the part I don't like. I think when she comes out of the bomb shelter and sees the birds she should of took her mask off an just looked around to see the world was normal. I think adding the whole alien fight scene and how he was right just ruined the movie. Then it draws back to the scene when she figured out that Goodman had held that other girl here captive and probably killed her. Why would they add that part if it turns out there was an attack from aliens. If it turned out he was lying that would have made the movie and the ending way better. The ending was cheesy but the movie is still worth watching."

Yes we should be led to believe that he has lost his family due to the occurrences outside, but then with this title, we know something has happened outside, thus taking away an element of surprise.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a classic tension riser of a film. The scene at the dinner table where Michelle is trying to get something from Howard, is one of the highlights of the film, and Winstead puts in a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>Why she hasn't had more prolific roles is beyond me, she has some wonderful screen presence.<br/><br/>Goodman is intense to the point of almost farcical, you just know he is going to explode, but you'll never know whether it's going to happen then, or a little later.<br/><br/>The ending is good, that's all i'm going to say.<br/><br/>So it's a wonderfully tense film, with some really creepy elements, but just don't expect anything too left-field."

To get to the point, I loved this movie...until the last 20 minutes, or so, kicked in. I felt gutted as I walked out. To me it almost felt like the writers suddenly remembered ""Oh, we almost forgot this is a sci-fi, alien flick"" and wrote the ending with that in mind. I wish they had forgot. This movie starts of with a very interesting pace, leaving you clueless to what is exactly going on. Found it very interesting that it never bored me, even when your cast is pretty much 3 actors and over 1 hour of the film is filmed in a confined space. The whole plot started with a bang. Locked in a bunker, creepy old man tells you this unbelievable tale of nuclear/chemical/martian attack. Everyone is dead. Except the three in the bunker. Can Michelle believe Howard? What is going on? All of sudden we are in a mystery, what is out there and what happened to Howard's daughter? After further discoveries, you get eager.

Michelle escaping in a crazy delightful sequence, to only destroy the movie when she gets outside. You never know what Howard's true intentions were, you don't get to know what happened to his ""daughter"". You get Michelle destroying a gigantic monster, that is about to swallow a whole car, but is taken down by a molotov, that Michelle had more than enough time to craft whilst the monster is raising the car?!! And the final decision, felt out of place. All in all, This movie failed to deliver a true climatic finish, maybe drop the aliens and stick to the more realistic kidnap, and murder plot. John Goodman's performance didn't deserve an ending written in 10 minutes on a notepad on top of your knees. This is MY OPINION. Take it with a grain of salt, and form your own. Thank you."

","To be honest, I quite like the first one. It does very good in keeping audience wonder ""what the f___ is going on"". The main issue is that the whole movie was pushed by a single mysterious event that it never fully explained. It was kind of a linear ride.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is a much richer experience. The chemistry between characters are constantly changing during the major part of the movie. Audience constantly changes their emotional perspective with the main protagonist (Michelle, by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). And the plot is not driven by the singular mystery disaster, but much more.<br/><br/>No doubt director Dan Trachtenberg did a great job in multiple levels. With much less CG in the movie, the tension is greatly contributed by the 3 main actors in it. Luckily for audience, they all did a great job.<br/><br/>I'd really like to see a 3rd movie in the Cloverfield franchise. I know it would be hard to not be a cheesy disaster movie (like Independence Day).

","First off, despite what the title may lead you to believe, this film has absolutely nothing to do with the original Cloverfield. Even calling it a ""blood relative"" as J.J. Abrahms has called it is stretching it.<br/><br/>Despite this, 10 Cloverfield Lane is able to stand on it's own for the most part. I won't go into too much detail as it's a film that's best to go into knowing as little as possible, but this is one of the closest examples of a modern-like Hitchcock film that I can think of. First time director Dan Trachtenberg demonstrates that he has a promising career ahead of him being able to create an extremely claustrophobic, creepy, and tense atmosphere that will keep viewers on the edge of their seat. It's less than 5 minutes into the film before the films grabs you and doesn't let you go until close before the credits roll. The plot is simple, yet intriguing and becomes more and more unsettling with each reveal. The performances are also a big reason this movie works as well as it does, in particular John Goodman who steals the show.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the films takes a nosedive in it's last 15-20 minutes. Without spoiling anything, it takes a strange direction and suddenly becomes something incredibly campy and silly in the worst way possible. I felt like I was watching a completely different movie. It doesn't ruin the complete experience, but it certainly leaves a sour taste in your mouth as the credits roll. <br/><br/>If it hadn't been for the ending, I would have easily given this an 8, possibly even a 9. But because of it's overall impact on the film, I have no choice but to give it a 7. Still, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a rare film that manages to be simple, yet riveting. It's a shame that it has to drop the ball in the third act or else this could have possibly been one of the best films of the year. Despite this, the pro's still outweigh the con's heavily and it's a film that I highly recommend checking out. Just make sure to have your expectations in the right place beforehand."
"fourstringwizard","7","0","2","11 April 2016"," NOT related to ""Cloverfield"", but still worth seeing
","Don't be fooled by the film's title - it is in no way related to ""Cloverfield."" You can't even call it a ""blood relative"" (as some reviewers have done), because they're both very different movies. If you go in expecting a sequel or tie-in, you'll be disappointed. I'd wager the only reason they share titles was to attract more viewers.<br/><br/>That said, this movie is an entertaining little sci-fi thriller that uses a ""less is more"" approach. Don't expect a lot of jump scares or action on the level of ""Cloverfield"". Rather, expect a constant sense of tension and danger. My main gripe with this movie is the ending, which I think could have been written WAY better, and somehow just didn't fit with the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>However, the best part of this movie is John Goodman's performance. As someone who's used to seeing him in more ""good guy"" roles, his role here was very refreshing, and he nailed it to perfection. I think it's worth seeing just for that, even if you just end up ""Red Box""-ing this title."

A woman is in a car accident and is taken to an underground bunker that was built by John Goodman's character. He tells her that the world is dead and non-breathable. The film progresses and 1 character dies unexpectedly. The film is scary and relies upon story instead of jump-scares and gore. Bradley Cooper has a cameo in the film if you can find it. Goodman's performance was incredibly chilling.

","Really nicely done! I will try not to give out any spoilers (you will see the warning when I do). This movie was a bit predictable when the trailer came out. Going to the movies, I found out that predictable is the only thing the movie is not. <br/><br/>Goodman was amazing as were the other actors that played with. He was really really good, from words to expressions even to breathing! The story is a captivating one, I mean it includes a bunker! What else do you need?<br/><br/>It was tense throughout, nicely done with its moments of tension but also the relaxed ones that kind of led you to think that everything would be OK, just around the time that something new happened! I do have my objections for some parts but I think that the overall feeling was good.<br/><br/>I really think that in their efforts to try and keep the ending a bit unpredictable, the script was kind of confusing with chemical warfare, conspiracies and other incidents that they seemed a bit out of place and just there to confuse. <br/><br/>(spoiler alert) I mean that the guy built the bunker only recently but then how did he keep this girl from the local school as a prisoner there when she was little or something? It's kind of out of the context and time. <br/><br/>Anyway, the one thing that I did not like and did not appreciate was the ending with the aliens that seemed a bit stupid and far fetched! I mean, it's a solid movie and then you show that she actually threw a bottle of whiskey (talk about a baseball throw) into the mouth of the monster and then she survived the fall. Yes, that's plausible. And then when she escaped she decided, having all this experience from throwing the bottle to join forces and fight for humanity. These last couple of scenes threw the movie from a solid 9 to a marginal 7 for me..."

","I think we all remember the Hand held original movie ""Cloverfield."" To be honest I wasn't a fan. It didn't really move me nor have me on the edge of my seat. This one, however...in fact..DOES! What amazes me about this movie is how good the acting and pacing is! It keeps you hooked and wandering what will happen next. It's the story of a girl named Michelle who is driving late at night gets hit and wakes up in a basement room. She then learns that a man by the name of Howard saved her life and brought her her back to the house for safe keeping. We then start to see that Howard is not as nice as we would hoped he be. She then comes to realize that outside the house are alien life forms. Will she stay in the house with crazy Howard or will she go outside to face the aliens? The acting by John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is brilliant. They both worked really well together. The direction was good, as was the choice of camera angles and the F/X.<br/><br/>Way better than the original CloverField. This one remains in one location the entire movie and manages to keep you glued to the screen. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. 8/10 4/5 stars. Highly recommended."
"lambchops23","8","0","2","7 April 2016"," constantly changing, consistently enthralling
","My boyfriend and I saw this on a limb, $5 Tuesday and all, and we didn't have a lot of expectations. <br/><br/>First of all, I usually consider myself pretty good at guessing the outcomes of horror and thriller movies, but this one was different. Six times in the movie there were BIG plot twists, ones that made me turn to my boy friend and silently mouth ""What the cussss?"" <br/><br/>Things I liked about the movie: <br/><br/>The acting was great. With only 5 or 6 characters, the acting had to be good in order for it to work, and the actors delivered. <br/><br/>The costuming was cool. With Michelle wearing Megan's clothes, as soon as she found out that the girl in the picture wasn't Megan, she went straight back to wearing her clothes that she wore in the crash. <br/><br/>It was intense. I am not an easily frightened person, but with everything going on, it got me worked up. But with the intensity, there was very well placed lulls. Sometimes in thrillers there can be too many jumps and it's not enjoyable, but this movie had just the right amount. <br/><br/>It wasn't ""found footage."" The original Cloverfield was a good movie, it was intense and entertaining and a cool concept, but with the way it was filmed it prevented any character development or detailed story telling, so it wasn't a GREAT movie. <br/><br/>Things I didn't like:<br/><br/>The ending. I know that this is a Cloverfield movie, so of course there has to be aliens to some degree, but up until the actual sight of the alien ship, this movie was a psychological thriller, which I loved. The whole time you're wondering if Howard is crazy or not, and it turns out he is, just not in the way you originally thought. Having the aliens come in at the end was mashing two different threats and genres together (alien threat and Howard) which was kind of hard for me. Switching villains in the last 15 minutes is generally avoided when making movies. I think that if this wasn't a ""Cloverfield"" movie, and just a normal movie, it would've been awesome if the whole ""air being infected"" thing was just one big show orchestrated by Howard to keep Michelle in the bunker with him, but I realize that would have made the woman smashing her head against the door not part of the movie, and that was the best scene in my opinion. But, considering that they HAD to include aliens, I am happy with the way the movie ended. <br/><br/>Now I want to come back to the plot twists. <br/><br/>Plot twist one: The woman throwing herself against the door with the corroding face. Up until that point you thought that Howard was crazy and was just keeping Michelle hostage, but then you see that he's right, something is going on outside the bunker. <br/><br/>Plot twist two: Michelle accepts that the outside world is contaminated, and life goes on ""as normal"" in the bunker until she has to fix the air filter, where she finds Megan's message scratched into the hatch. Suddenly your safe feeling of Howard being a savior is turned to Howard being a murderer. <br/><br/>Plot twist three: Michelle shows Emmet the earring and picture and Emmet says ""That isn't Megan."" Now not only is Howard a murderer, but an added layer of crazy for being an alleged kidnapper of a young girl and having her wear he daughter's clothes. <br/><br/>Plot twist four: As Emmet and Michelle construct their hazmat suit, Howard finds their tools and confronts them, shooting Emmet in the head. <br/><br/>Plot twist five: Michelle escapes and makes it out of the bunker, where she sees birds flying over head. She takes her mask off, and the air is not poisoned. So Howard was wrong. <br/><br/>Plot Twist six: As Michelle is trying to get the car started she sees a UFO. That means that Howard was wrong, but also right, it was an alien attack (note that when the lady was trying to get in the bunker, she said ""IT only touched me for a second."" So it makes sense that the air isn't infected, but whatever touched her is.) <br/><br/>There it is, not one, not two, but SIX plot twists. Usually a story can only handle so many twists before the viewer gets confused and loses interest, but 10 Cloverfield Lane didn't have that problem. Every 15 minutes something changed, it kept you on the edge of your seat and it was SO well done. Bravo to the writers and directors. <br/><br/>Overall this was just a great movie that had you constantly second guessing, jumping, and trying not to spill your large diet coke. I read somewhere that JJ Abrams wants to make a movie connecting the original Cloverfield to this one and I hope that he does. I would not mind a Cloverfield franchise going on, and I usually don't love alien movies. But lets be honest, if anyone should do alien movies, it's JJ. <br/><br/>So that's my 2 cents on 10 Cloverfield Lane. Everyone that enjoys thrillers should see this movie, especially on $5 Tuesday. I'm probably going to go see it again next week."

It was the kind of scenario that you would normally expect to see on a b movie. I left the theater with mixed feelings and therefore I can't rate it with more than 5/10.

I was impressed!<br/><br/>There's already a Spoiler notice on this review, but still if you haven't seen this film I will spoil it rotten so watch out!<br/><br/>After being run off the road by a truck, Michelle played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead finds herself chained to a wall alone in a stone cell. A man named Howard played by John Goodman tells her he's locked her up in the bunker to keep her safe against a nuclear holocaust as the air outside has been contaminated and is fatal to humans. But as she and fellow survivor Emmett played by John Gallagher, Jr. get used to living in the bunker, they begin to suspect Howard is not all that he seems.<br/><br/>The mystery element of this film is brilliant, when you think Howard is up to something he appears extremely creepy, but when you realise he may be telling the truth he still doesn't sit right with you and something seems odd about him.<br/><br/>The scene where Michelle and Emmett are having a laugh over dinner and Howard flips out smashing his hand against the table scared the absolute life out of me. I have never jumped so far out of a chair in my life. This film is full of jump-scares, and they all work perfectly. I was always on the edge of my seat, expecting something to happen that will make me jump out of my chair.<br/><br/>This film manages to unnerve you within the first five minutes which is awesome. Before the titles have even appeared, you are nervous and loving the suspense.<br/><br/>The most bizarre portion of the film is the final 15 minutes.<br/><br/>After Howard has killed Emmett and Michelle has made a biohazard suit, she escapes to find the air is completely breathable, making you think that everything Howard has said was false and she had been imprisoned in the bunker by him. Just as she realises this, taa- daaa, Aliens!<br/><br/>Aliens attack Michelle and attempt to exterminate her with toxic gas and an alien being that attacks her. She manages to destroy the ship and drives away where over the radio she hears the world has been overridden by Aliens.<br/><br/>This shock ending has been met differently by many people, personally I love it, I love how one of Howard's theories that has been laughed at by the characters and is played as a joke throughout the course of the film, turns out to be what's really happening. The aliens aren't the main focus of the film, they're just there for an awesome shock ending, which I love.<br/><br/>This films direction is amazing. It's so perfectly claustrophobic and tense and conveys the nightmare of being trapped in a bunker with a madman really well.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint, it would be the characters who are so dull that I struggled to remember their names after I'd walked out of the cinema.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, simple as. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is perfect for every scene, John Goodman is creepy, funny and scary at the same time, and John Gallagher Jr. is perfect for this type of role.<br/><br/>So... Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an amazing film that will have you laughing one minute, jumping out of your seat the next, intrigued the next minute, and surprised the next minute.<br/><br/>The acting and direction are amazing and convey perfectly what these characters are going through. The jump scares work perfectly and the story is fascinating, oh, and that ending! <br/><br/>Overall, this film was awesome!"

Also that bomb shelter that John Goodman's character took that woman in looked pretty nice which just could come in handy for anyone in case of a nuclear war. Now if a nuclear war were to happen that'll be me, my family and my girlfriend playing board games and charades, watching movies and TV episodes on the VHS, DVD player or Blu-ray player, reading books, eating a lifetime supply of food, having many bedrooms and bathrooms, doing laundry and listening to music on a stereo or jukebox in a bomb shelter like that. I wouldn't want to be in a shelter with a psychopath like John Goodman's character though and that was pretty freaky after his character got acid on himself and he looked like a monster there. I also wonder how all this got from New York all the way to Texas. Oh well my guess is that after that monster invaded New York, his alien friends started to invade more of the country.

","10 Cloverfield Lane was an outstanding piece of work, great directorial debut, it is actually hard to believe that is his first film. It was so methodical, and structured with key elements and plot points that were necessary for the film's advancement without clichÃ©s. I can see now why critics were saying this movie was a bit reminiscent of Hitchcock films. Side note, you would only know what they (critics) meant, if you actually watched more than just Psycho, Vertigo, or Birds.<br/><br/>I truly did not expect to like the film as much as did... I do say like, however, as opposed to love because of the film's ending. 10 Cloverfield Lane's buildup is absolutely phenomenal, but after the lead actress escapes the clutches of the crazed kidnapper, the conclusion feels outrageously out of place, out of tune, and really just didn't flow well with the rest of the film. Even Winstead's character has a moment of negative disbelief ""Come On."" Now, this being the supposed sequel to CLOVERFIELD (2009) I expected it to be absolutely awful because the first film was found footage. Cloverfield (2009), if it had utilized great cinematography the way this film did, that movie could have possibly been a spectacle for the monster movie genre, or just much better than it was, in my opinion, but I absolutely detest shaky cam and even more-so found footage films. Also, the first film contained mostly improvisation from the main characters, whereas this one had a very solid script, that gave a depth to each character, rather than just ""OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!"" and the annoying incessant shrieking of the woman in the first film ""JASON! JASON! JASON!"" UGH! This sequel is a huge step up in quality overall.<br/><br/>Even though the film had a bad moment, the negative aspect of this film cannot compare to everything it did right. The acting was a marvel to behold, I can see why Mary Elizabeth Winstead was the first and only choice for this film, I could not see anyone else playing her character better than she did. Same goes for Jon Goodman. Emmett's character could've been written a bit better but otherwise, solid casting. Also, the small cast worked so well because of the first one's need to give the viewers a scope of the destruction through the first person point of view whereas this one focuses more on the aftermath of the first film while also adding to it, in an unconventional way. I can easily say that this is going to be another film I can add to my favorites, and I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for something good to watch."
"ahassan-12342","7","0","2","26 March 2016"," Well made psychological thriller... but tenuously related to Cloverfield
","Initially starting life out as a script titled ""The Cellar"", this inherited the title of Cloverfield after JJ Abrams' Bad Robot Productions became involved in the project. Even with the title though, the best way to approach this movie though is as a companion piece to the 2008 film rather than a traditional sequel or an of spin off.<br/><br/>The directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg finds Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) waking-up in an underground bunker after a car accident. With her Howard (John Goodman), who she believes is her captor but he insists is Michelle's saviour as he brought her underground to protect her from the catastrophic event which has laid waste to humanity above. Also with her is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr), who believes in Howard's story of desolation. It is essentially a three-man cast and all are on top-form; in particular John Goodman, who uses his large frame in a claustrophobic setting to create menace rather than crossing the line into over-acting. The scenes are tense throughout as relationship between Michelle and Howard alternates from trust and distrust.<br/><br/>There are elements of Duncan Jones' ""Moon"" in this, in that we don't know whether we can trust the machine or person who has the most information. There also comparisons to JJ Abrams' TV series ""Lost"", particularly the first season finale where we were left to wonder what was inside the bunker, but this time in reverse.<br/><br/>The film's denouement is a slight letdown and feels oddly out of place in the context of the piece. It felt like the ending to a different film than to the one just seen. No matter, the real drama is in the interactions between the three characters in the bunker and it is this which makes it an enjoyable spectacle."

Her cell keeper is revealed to be Howard (another good turn from John Goodman) who warns her she is in a bomb shelter following a chemical warfare attack, and is being held there until it's safe to go above ground.<br/><br/>Much of the film is the two of them, and one more ""survivor"", trying to make the most of this bizarre situation, and figure whether his paranoid ramblings are valid.<br/><br/>Is Howard telling the truth, has humanity perished? If they have, who is responsible, and when will they be able to leave? <br/><br/>Another twist paints Howard to be a delusional killer, which is never followed through with, or built upon. <br/><br/>Alien invasion appears in the final reel, making me wonder would that make sense, and the three separate plot lines might tie together if I had seen the original film? As it is, this tense and occasionally creepy thriller feels more like three plot lines twirled together, without a satisfying ending to them, just a setup for more films. This is the second film I have seen this week that I can say that about.<br/><br/>Being watered down to a PG13/rating probably didn't help, either, as it somewhat limited the on-screen violence in a couple of scenes."

","When I went into this I had an expectation, an expectation that made me misinterpret the film, thanks to the trailer. This is why I don't watch trailers because they either falsely advertise the film, or they spoil it before you even see it. What I expected vs. what I got are two different things. What I got was a film full of suspense, drama, vulnerability, and most of all terror. There was more then a few occasion where I was actually worried about what will happen next. In this movie though, one man made this film all the difference in the world. John Goodman killed it in a role I never expected him to do, but his character is so unsettling and unpredictable it makes you feel like you're in the same situation as Winstead's character. I never felt a man with such ""generosity"" that it actually made him come across as loony. The director, Dan Tratchenberg deserves some respect for this, he has class, professionalism, and talent. I look forward to seeing more from this director. Everyone else was serviceable, Mary Elisabeth Winstead and her character were smart. John Gallagher was probably the weakest performance of the three, but not bad. However, the one thing I didn't like was the second half, I understand with a title like Cloverfield you need some alien action, will considering the psychological thriller in the first half, it was pretty much a batten switch for me. So if you are in the need for some intense suspense with a knockout performance from John Goodman, look no further then 10 Cloverfield Lane."

That film kept you wondering till the end, whereas 10 Cloverfield Lane felt like a roll your own adventure, a Frankenstein's monster made of parts you have seen elsewhere.

","Following a car accident, Michelle wakes up chained to a basement wall: it transpires the basement is a fallout bunker belonging to Howard, who saved her from the car crash and, together with Emmett (who helped him build it) is standing by for a stay of a year or more, giving the attack which is going on overhead. But Howard seems a bit intense, so is he telling the truth? Cloverfield was a found footage movie showing an alien assault on New York. 10 Cloverfield Lane is an entirely different kind of film. Staged tightly and claustrophobically more or less within the single setting of the bunker, this is a study of the interactions between three people: John Goodman is Howard, a truly intense performance. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as Michelle, is a victim with fight left in her: in fact, her character has a very strong arc, from someone who always runs away, to someone who learns how to fight for survival. John Gallgher Jr does well as Emmett, a rather thankless role of the third point on the triangle, necessary only for character dynamics between Michelle and Howard.<br/><br/>Not a great deal happens, but it happens very suspensefully.

Its a 7/10 because i can't rrmeber the last time i felt unsafe leaving a movie theatre without John Goodmans permission."

","'10 Cloverfield Lane' is about a woman held captive because her captor is convinced he's protecting her from a virus outside. She meets another man there, who's also being held captive. Throughout the movie, you're wondering whether the captor's insane, or if he's protecting them from a lethal disease outside.<br/><br/>It's a movie that invites comparisons. I'd personally compare it to 'Take Shelter', a film about a man who predicts a storm and hides him family in a bomb shelter, but throughout it's never clear whether he's right or if he's just imagining it. Another comparison is 'Misery', a story about a man being held captive who attempts to escape.<br/><br/>It's a tense, scary and gripping thriller focusing on their attempts to escape and uncover the truth about their captor. John Goodman who plays the captor, is fierce and intimidating, not a guy to be messed with. When the other two characters attempt to mess with his plans, this creates for great conflict and tension.<br/><br/>There's a subplot about a dead relative of the captor, which leads to interesting mystery investigation, but doesn't get fully developed.<br/><br/>Toward the end, it jumps the shark, forgetting to keep itself restrained, and gets a bit over the top, losing its plausibility."

","This was a weird experience....the first three quarters of the movie were quite riveting, the scenes in the bunker were claustrophobic and dark, creating a real tension and sense of mystery...at that point, I was really wondering where the story was going, it made me want to know more.... But then, all of a sudden, the storyline changes: we are thrown out of the bunker, in the outside world, where clearly something bad has happened and still is happening. Just we are not allowed to know exactly what...zombies? martians? space invaders? it was like being thrown into another movie, but then we ask ourself why they kept us locked into the bunker all that time... On top of all that, I found that the director made an exaggerated use of music, as if he wanted to use it not only to underline the tension but rather to create it; I thought this was over the top. The ending then - without spoiling it for other viewers - is like that of a TV series, where you need to wait the next episode to know what will happen; except that we won't know (unless they are planning a sequel....but not for me, I opt out...)"

AND...why didn't she go back and save John Goodman who saved her!!?? LAME all around!! I don't understand what the high rating viewers saw in this movie??? In a previous review, someone said, ""Spend the money. See the movie. Find out for yourself. It's worth it."" What's worth it?? Maybe John Goodman's performance, but the whole build up was such a let down! Would have been better if John Goodman turned out to really be a psycho. But he wasn't and she bailed on him! NOT COOL!"
"RyanTesone","8","0","2","20 March 2016"," ""Misery"" goes apocalyptic!
","What can I say about 10 Cloverfield Lane? Well, um..... Think the 90s film ""Misery"" but far more terrifying with an apocalyptic setting and aliens. So more-or-less a crossover between ""Misery"" and ""War of the Worlds"". <br/><br/>If you don't like horror movies, this is CERTAINLY not your cup of tea, in understatement. I would be lying if this movie didn't have the potential to emotionally scar anybody for a long while. I mean, the guy who voiced Sully in ""Monsters Inc."" is in it, so that should take the edge off, right? Well knowing that lone fact only made the film MORE intense.<br/><br/>There are only a handful of human characters seen in the film, one of which is our protagonist, Michelle, our on-and-off antagonist for the former 95% of the plot, Howard, and a secondary character acting as a friend to Michelle, Emmett. The acting was superb, and there was no apprehension in displaying both emotion and situational severity. Michelle and Emmett are both very well-written, and they displayed a very high degree of intelligence and cleverness as well. Howard's character is a bit more difficult to discuss, because his real motive was never really expanded-upon or made clearer than it actually was (on one-hand, he WAS trying to protect the other characters from the calamities outside his bunker, but he quickly became a lunatic whenever he is disrespected. But needless to say, he was absolutely crazy, and the writers did a terrific job in ensuring that he remain compelling, albeit frightening. Whenever he was on-screen, a general feeling of uneasiness just radiates off of the screen.<br/><br/>As previously-stated, this film was beyond intense! It actually eclipsed the general levels of intensity that one would associate with the film ""Misery"" (which, if you have seen that film before, is the same basic premise: an individual is injured in a car accident, they are taken into a refuge after being found, owner of said refuge is an on-and-off psychopath, injured individual formulates an escape method, etc). And it is for this reason alone that I will never see a film like this one again in theaters, despite it generally being an enjoyable/solid watch. There were jump scares present, but they just sort of ""occurred"" for a lack of better words, and they took you by surprise with little or no buildup. For example, one can consider the moment where Howard shoots Emmett, in which case an argument between the two is supposedly resolved and then BOOM! There was a tad bit of suspense in there, but it wasn't exactly what one would define as a suspenseful film, rather a horrific thriller. Interestingly, the underlying plot is actually within Michelle's mind: does she desire to escape from Howard's clutches and risk exposing herself to the apocalypse outside which may or may not actually exist, or does she want to spare her life albeit within Howard's bunker where she is being held hostage? That alone was an intriguing plot- piece.<br/><br/>What stole the show for me, however, were the extraterrestrials that showed-up at the very tail-end of the film (as in, the final ~5%). After dealing with Howard and taking her chances with a makeshift hazmat suit (that she and Emmett designed in efforts to create an escape plan), she exits the bunker at last, only to be met with a massive alien aircraft and what appears to be a worm-like quadruped just minutes later. This was perhaps the most drastic/sudden transformation in any plot that I have personally witnessed, and it was fantastic: one moment a character is escaping the clutches of a psychopath, and the next an alien scout is attempting to exterminate her. This is the very reason why this film can be described as ""95% Misery, 5% War of the Worlds"". <br/><br/>As a compilation of my thoughts, this was generally an enjoyable movie. But this said, the intensity level was too much for my liking, and I still cannot fathom that what I just watched was so terrifying. It is this reason that I would rate it a good 8/10."

","When you think of Horror movie sequels that have basically zero of the original crew and that has little to do with the first film, it's normally a combination for failure, But... 10 Clover field lane is the complete polar opposite being an extremely thrilling and suspenseful Mystery Thriller.<br/><br/>The acting was solid. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallighar Jr were good in the film. But the real star of the film is John Goodman.<br/><br/>John Goodman was phenomenal as the ""John Badman"" that is Howard (ha puns), a conspiracy theorist/ farmer with unspecified mental illnesses. Goodman perfectly portrays the innocent yet sinister man who you are never quite sure whether or not he can be trusted. The psychological thriller aspect of the film through this character was extremely tense as you are never quite sure of what he's done and what are his intentions.<br/><br/>The Movie was nail bitingly tense as we dip in and out of trust with the bunk owner Howard and watch as the two ""guests"" plot against him and escape, hopefully back to civilisation. This film will have you hooked and even shock you at points. This film has a great premise that would have made for an even more amazing stand alone movie.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my only real criticism of the film, and that is the fact it is a Clover field spin off sequel. It was unnecessary. The Clover field aspect of this film was nothing more than a way of getting butts on seats and money in the bank. The majority of the film takes place in an UNDERGROUND BUNKER, so why they decided to add giant alien monsters into the mix I don't know. This film really tries to be two films rather than one. There is the suspense thriller and there is the monster horror movie. It does a great job with the former but barely introduces the latter. I read that this was originally a stand alone idea but was tweaked to fit into the Clover field universe just like ""voila, loads more money.""<br/><br/>As a whole I was extremely gripped, surprised and impressed with this movie that for the most part was a fantastic suspense thriller. If the ending wasn't simply a corporate decision to maximise profits, which it absolutely was, this film would be bloody perfect. But aside from the terrible title and random aliens this is brilliant suspense thriller that is definitely worth a watch"

","Found footage monster thriller, 'Cloverfield', came out in 2008 to mixed reviews. The shaky, raw camera footage generated a sense of realism that was supposed to create an authentic atmosphere, giving the audience the feeling that they were witnessing an event that actually happened. The whole spectacle worked well but lacked cohesion and purpose that affected the overall impact. I for one was left a little confused about what was happening, possibly mimicking the emotions of the young actors that appeared in the film. '10 Cloverfield Lane' has been promoted as a distant cousin of the Gen Y original piece but what we have here is a return to a more traditional thriller that works its magic very well. '10 Cloverfield Lane' keeps you guessing all the way through the 103 minute running time setting itself in a more personal and private situation that fabricates a considerably greater atmosphere of anxiety than its blood relative.<br/><br/>Young Directorial dÃ©butant, Dan Trachtenberg, has been given his shot at impressing the big boys at Paramount Pictures and he hasn't done his reputation any harm. Backed up by Executive Producer, J.J. Abrams Bad Robot Production Company and young Danny is ticking all the right boxes in the presence of some very powerful Hollywood heavyweights. His niche seems to be the suspenseful surroundings of the thriller and with a first time effort such as '10 Cloverfield Lane', Trachtenberg is well on his way to becoming one of the best men behind the camera in this genre. He has made a compact, intimate thriller that oozes an anxious and awkward mood that never lets the audience to comfortably settle into their seats. The viewer is always presented with the question - Is it or isn't it? - when it comes to the context of the story. Originally based on a script that had nothing to do with the ""Cloverfield"" time-line, the narrative was re-worked by Josh Campbell and Matthew Struecken into a 'Cloverfield' sequel that never becomes too complicated but rather relies on a simple setting that is easy to follow. Like all good thrillers, '10 Cloverfield Lane' simmers away under the surface with the occasional well timed burst of body jolting suspense that inevitably builds up to an interesting climax.<br/><br/>Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a woman that is going through a difficult period in her relationship. Whilst driving alone in her car on a presumably quiet and uneventful night, she is suddenly driven off the road in a high impact collision that was never seen coming. When she wakes, Michelle finds herself in a room on a mattress with her injuries carefully tended to. A strange, off beat man reveals himself to her as Howard (John Goodman) who tells her that she has been saved from a catastrophic disaster that has left the breathable air toxic. Michelle is in a bunker deep underground with no knowledge of what is actually happening in the world above. For her own sanity, the young woman welcomes the discovery of another member of this strange abode, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), who is an acquaintance of this mysteriously unhinged Howard. As the film progresses, layers start to form around the narrative that immediately keeps the audience enthralled.<br/><br/>There is not much to the cast as it revolves around three characters but each are absolutely necessary to create the desired affect. Relative unknowns, Winstead and Gallagher Jr. put in some very engaging performances as the two young occupants (or are they victims?). Both look comfortable in their roles that will no doubt catch the attention of future employers. Michelle and Emmett are two characters that provide plenty of exposure for the young actors as they look to step up the ladder in terms of their careers. The real ""meat in the sandwich"" is John Goodman as the uneasy sociopath, Howard. The man is a volcano waiting to erupt with a mood that ultimately encompasses the whole production. I love Goodman and this is without doubt his most accomplished role since his star turn in the Coen Brothers, 'The Big Lebowski'.<br/><br/>'10 Cloverfield Lane' is a good strong thriller. Watching John Goodman work his way through his very disturbed character is worth the price of admission alone. The film has a simple layout that builds into an engrossingly layered story. If there is to be a small complaint to Dan Trachtenberg's debut feature it would have to be the climax but then again it is a relation to 'Cloverfield'."
"DKosty123","8","0","3","19 March 2016"," Talent Carries A Suspense Feature Throwback
","I have looked at the youngsters reviewing this and I have to say that they lack the knowledge to look at this film objectively for a couple of reasons. First, a lot of them are too young to know what a good suspense film is all about. Second, they are looking for a sequel which while the title might suggest it is, the film stands alone on it's own. I have never seen the original Cloverfield, so I did not have an idiotic bias going to see this one. The lesson to be learned here is do not think because a title is partly the same, that your going to a sequel. None of the cast in this film appeared in the earlier one and the only relationship it has is the JJ Abrams guy and he has done a variety of things besides these films. <br/><br/>As for the film, a lot of the old suspense films that are classics take a fair amount of time developing the first action. The classic Hitchcock film Psycho takes about 20 minutes or more developing Janet Leigh's character before it really gets into the creepy suspense. This movie takes about 5 minutes and starts the action with Mary Elizabeth Winstead right in the opening credits. <br/><br/>The spacing of the accident in the credits and then Michelle waking up are done almost perfectly. She wakes up locked up, shackled, with an IV in her arm and in a bomb shelter. It is this initial change that tells the viewer something different is coming in this one.Then she tries to get to her cell phone and when she gets it realizes she has no service. <br/><br/>Then Michelle finds herself at the mercy and debt of Howard (John Goodman). In this one, Goodman shows off his dramatic skills as one of the better actors around who does not get enough lead roles. In this one he is solid and even creepy. The plot is written to keep everyone guessing as to what the reality of this is. Then Michelle gets introduced to Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who is the other person Howard let into the bunker.<br/><br/>Howard is very convincing about the story of them needing to stay in the bunker, though not real clear about why. Emmett assures Michelle that he fought his way into the bunker because he knows there is a problem outside, but is not real clear about what the problem is either. So Michelle has to make a choice who to trust. Both Howard and Emmett make cases to her about that.<br/><br/>In the sum, we have an old plot device here known as character development. It is something that CGI audiences waiting for the next explosion do not understand well, and is done brilliantly here. Michelle chooses to trust Emmett because she can relate to him much better than Howard who seems to jump at any shadow that he feels is a threat to him.<br/><br/>Then there is the back story about Howard's wife and daughter who have seemingly left him. When he tells Michelle about a photo he says is his daughter, Emmett then informs Michelle she is not because he knows who she is. This makes Howard even creepier.<br/><br/>From here a lot happens in the shelter, and the viewer, much less Michelle are really left guessing what is the real situation as there are few clues that add up to anything. From here, I will leave you guessing what comes next because this is the set up.<br/><br/>The ending is really unexpected, for us folks who remember the old films with the happy ones. While the ending is different, it does leave open an actual possible sequel which could have lots of those CGI effects modern movie viewers often demand. <br/><br/>One thing that does not relate to the movie but does relate to John Goodman, in 1993 he did a pretty good comedy called MatinÃ©e in which atomic attack, 1950's Sci-Fi, and coincidentally a bomb shelter are a part of the plot. Schlock producer Lawrence Woolsey's only relationship to this movie is Goodman breaks into a bomb shelter in that one. Goodman is more of a star in this movie.<br/><br/>Still this movie in a way brings back the cold war theme in a totally reverse sort of way. The action and development create solid suspense and late in the film some of the hand held camera technique is used. If Alfred Hitchcock were still alive, I would like to have seen what he could have done with the camera work and suspense of this one. While it is not the master at work, this does come off pretty well overall.<br/><br/>This movie ends in a new normal, very appropriate at this time."
"ptrickrobles","9","0","2","19 March 2016"," Tightly woven thriller
","10 Cloverfield Lane is an amazing thriller that thrives on exploiting the pitfalls of human imagination. With 10 Cloverfield Lane, Trachtenberg succeeds in creating a story that deliberately presents and withholds information. Much like parsing a mystery novel, parsing 10 Cloverfield Lane means speculation from pieces of the whole, and hoping that the story reveals the characters' reality.<br/><br/>The tense atmosphere on which thrillers thrive is supported by a powerful performance from the main cast. John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead play their roles perfectly, contributing to an immersive experience in which the viewer feels compelled by each character's motivations. Moviegoers need not be afraid that acting will hamper an already well-crafted world.<br/><br/>Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane successfully designed a paranoid's nightmare with strong characters, that will have audience members simultaneously eager and uneasy. Not for the faint of heart, perfect for the curious of mind."
"daniel-couch-421-865072","9","0","2","19 March 2016"," I really really liked this movie
","So, I expected something short, sharp and open ended to move onto a loaded big budget sequel to Cloverfield. A gap filler if you will. I was very surprised at how quickly we moved into the deep, personal issues of Howard. I felt for this guy who had been left bitter from what I presume was a hard divorce. However, I am very jealous of his bunker. I think John Goodmans performance is nothing short of brilliant. I've always enjoyed his on screen presence from Roseanne to Barton Fink to The Big Lebowski but this was something else. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was also very good as Michelle. I enjoyed the storyline, the direction was good but I can't understand how someone like Trachtenberg got the opportunity and was trusted to direct such a big movie as he's so young and to be honest, inexperienced with big name actors. He managed to pull it off though and managed to get some good performances. The tone of the movie was tense without any of those tedious jokes to try and break the tension and make sound bites for the trailer. Speaking of the trailer, Bad Robot and JJ Abrams have made a great decision in taking the whole trailer from the first 30 minutes or so. This gives 2/3's of the movie to the audience as a complete surprise which was really refreshing. Seeing so many well known producers and writers (JJ, Burk, Goddard, Chazelle) working on a project like this is refreshing but also very exciting as a fan because this much talent wouldn't be working on just this alone, it's obviously the continuation of the Cloverfield franchise. Anyway, the ending kind of lost me to be honest. It stunk of War of the Worlds and I didn't like that. It seemed like lazy film making. Her fight with the alien ship seemed forced and out of character from what we'd seen from her entrapment. Never the less, it was a surprise (not in the trailer ðŸ˜‰) and it will lead nicely into another movie. All in all I really liked it. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys science fiction movies."

","I have seen half of the first Cloverfield movie and thought to that point it was average, I stopped watching and just read up the rest of the movie instead of watching it. I read all the theories and stuff that the monster didn't die at the end and didn't really care much for it. This was leading up to the second movie this one that I done this and from seeing trailers and all it got me very very hyped, I don't know what it was but the concept of 3 people in a bunker with a giant monster outside kind of excited me, that's not what actually happens in the movie. Instead there are lots of monsters, or 3 kind of noticeable ones, Howard the doomsday prepper murderer and possibly pervert? The anus dog monster thing and the alien ship that's not actually a ship and is actually an alien? Just please watch the movie, all the actors performances are great, the suspense and intense feeling you get watching it is unmatched from any movie, the soundtrack is amazing it's just, the ending is good but slightly, come on, could've done better."

","10 Cloverfield Lane is 2016's biggest surprise, nobody knew we were getting a sequel to Cloverfield, but really we never were. This film carries the Cloverfield name but it actually has nothing to do with Cloverfield. None of it is filmed with hand-held cameras and honestly i found myself a lot more entertained by this one. I like the first film a lot, but this is a different film entirely and it really benefits from it too.<br/><br/>The film follows Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character who is involved in a terrible accident, but is ""rescued"" and finds herself captive in a bunker with Emmett played by John Gallager Jr. And Howard, a man who doesn't seem like the person he says he is, played by a creepy but incredibly well acted John Goodman. He tells her that she can't leave the bunker because the air outside is toxic and that they will all die, but is this as accurate as he says? Honestly the cast in this film is great. John Goodman has done some brilliant films and i love him as an actor, but i have NEVER seen him like this before. There are scenes where you feel bad for him and you want to really like him and then he does something where you're thinking ""who the hell is this guy?!"" There was more than one occasion where i jumped out of my seat and the tension really had me gripping the sides of my seat because it was so well done. There is a scene quite near the end where something happened and my hand instantly went to cover my mouth and i stayed like that for at least 5 minutes because it shocked me so much, there is no build up, it just happened. <br/><br/>Most of the scenes that take place in this bunker have an air of tension to them, even when John Goodman is wiggling his backside to music on his jukebox i thought, man this guy is hiding something. It is really easy to put yourself in the shoes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character because it almost makes you feel like you are trapped in this bunker with the three characters not knowing who to trust. A lot of people have issues with the ending of this film and yeah, i don't really know how to feel about it either. It happens, the film ends and you're sort of sat there like ""hmm.. okay"", i don't hate it like a lot of people do, but i see what they're getting at and it could have been handled a little better. But all in all, this is one of the best films of 2016 so far. The last 15-20 minutes are straight up tension fuelled madness and my heart was racing. I'd say watch it a few times because the ending may make more sense which is why i am going to see it again, but this is a highly enjoyable, intense thrill ride which needs to be seen"

","10 Cloverfield Lane is the spiritual sequel to the 2008 found footage monster movie Cloverfield, featuring the very scary John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and John Gallagher, Jr. It follows the events of a young woman who wakes up in an underground bunker after a car crash, and discovering Howard (Goodman) who claims that some unique event has wiped out everything on the surface and poisoned the air. <br/><br/>'Monsters come in many forms' they do indeed in this intense, suspenseful thriller (horror). First, it does not need any viewers to see the previous film, I believe though they are completely different films.<br/><br/>So hats off to Dan Trachtenberg's gripping debut as he directs an experience we will never forget. John Goodman makes the best performance I have ever seen from the fine actor (have not seen to many Goodman films, but enough), as he shows of a psychotic Norman Bate of himself. As soon as you see him you know this character is not right, actually prefer to be fighting monster instead. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, also gives a great performance as well as we share the experience with her, and almost imagine ourselves in her position.<br/><br/>The film is really intense, and will always keep you on your toes, for whatever comes your way. What makes the narrative so good is that if focuses on what's happening elsewhere when the world is going to hell, and ask you where would you rather be, underground or on land, trust me after seeing this film, you may not know.<br/><br/>However, I can't say the film is a must see, but if you like a great intense experience, then this is perfect for you.

","'10 CLOVERFIELD LANE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Sci-fi sequel to the 2008 low budget monster flick hit 'CLOVERFIELD'. The film was once again co-produced by J.J. Abrams, and it was directed by first time feature filmmaker Dan Trachtenberg. It was scripted by Josh Campbell, Matt Stuecken and Damien Chazelle (the writer and director of 2014's critically acclaimed hit 'WHIPLASH'). The story deals with three survivors, trying to wait out an alien invasion in an underground bunker; only they are unaware of what the world is really like outside, and one of them might be dangerously insane. It's based on a spec script, by Campbell and Stuecken, and it's been called a 'spiritual successor' to 'CLOVERFIELD', by Abrams (but not a direct sequel). The film stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher, Jr.. The critics have raved about the movie, and it's a huge hit at the Box Office. I loved it as well. <br/><br/>The story begins with a woman named Michelle (Winstead), on the run from her fiancÃ© Ben (voiced by Bradley Cooper). While driving though rural Louisiana, her car is struck by a pickup truck; and she's knocked unconscious. She wakes up, locked up in an underground bunker; believing she's being held captive there, by a man named Howard (Goodman). Howard (Goodman), and another man there named Emmett (Gallagher, Jr.), explain to her that the world is under attack; and she's being kept there for her own safety. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of the original 'CLOVERFIELD', and I like this sequel even more. In some ways it's a lot like it's innovative predecessor, and in other ways it's completely different. It's made on a similar (but smaller) budget (of just $15 million), and it's set in the same world; but with different characters, a different setting, and different monsters. It's also not filmed in the same 'shaky-cam' found footage format; which I'm a fan of, but I'm happy that the filmmakers took a different approach. The acting is much better, this time around, and the characters are a lot more interesting and engaging (I also like the creatures and special effects a lot more). It's also cool how the movie makes a completely different tonal change (at the end). It's almost like two different films; which has been criticized by some, but I loved it. It's a truly great sci-fi classic (at least it will be).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U"
"RforFilm","9","0","2","16 March 2016"," Relying on the little we know, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a great semi sequel that's better then the original
","In a lot of ways, J.J. Abrams has become something of a modern day Steven Spielberg. He likes to produce stories with action that are surrounded in mystery. Given how the marketing campaigns for the Star Trek, Lost TV series and the recent Star Wars film gave away very little during the previews, I almost forgot that earlier Spielberg movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Indiana Jones all sold us on the idea that we know what were getting, yet there was something else that we were not seeing. A hidden villain, a hidden prize, or a hand reaching into the unknown, stuff like this will certainly draw people into the story further.<br/><br/>One such film of his was the found footage monster movie, Cloverfield. Rather then putting the focus on the monster, the focus was on the people and their horror as the city of New York was now the playground to some space creature. Believe it or not, the original Godzilla also had a similar focus was that was all about the horrors of the Hiroshima bombing. While Cloverfield wasn't a great movie, it did help boast the popularity of monster movies again. WeÂ…kind of return to the same world with the long awaited sequel, 10 Cloverfield Lane.<br/><br/>Rather then a found footage movie, this is shot more like a traditional film.<br/><br/>We open with Michelle (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who's leaving her apartment in New Orleans to head up north. She senses the feeling that she's being watched at a gas station, but she continues further down the road. After a brief phone call from her boyfriend, she gets into a car crash, leaving her unconscious. <br/><br/>She wakes up sometime later in a room with no windows and chained to the wall. After nearly setting a fire as a means of escape, she then meets local farm boy Emmett (played by John Gallagher, Jr) and the maker of the bunker their currently in, Howard (played by John Goodman). Howard tries to explain that while he rescued Michelle, there was some sort of an attack on all the major cities and that the outside air in contaminated, but she doesn't believe him. She tries at one point to escape, but see's an older woman with burns on her face, suggesting that Howard may have been right. The three adjust to a life within the underground bunker, but Michelle still senses something may be up.<br/><br/>In terms of it's connection to the first movie, you could say that this is a totally different movie, yet this still qualifies as a monster movie. It's a kind of monster that you'd find in another horror movie, but I don't want to give anything away. With the majority of the movie being set in the bunker, 10 Cloverfield Lane takes full advantage of it's claustrophobic environment, making for a tense thriller. The film creates something that feels homely, yet tight in the bigger moments that require wishful thinking.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has only had a few supporting roles in Live Free or Die Hard and Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, but she shows a lot of rage from her performance, going from frightened of her surroundings, to looking for right way out. John Goodman is an actor who we've seen for a while, but has unfairly not had a chance to play a role that is as big as this. Much of 10 Cloverfield Lane centers around the role-play between the two and how much they can out smart and dominate each other.<br/><br/>Fans of the original may be put off by the sudden change in tone and even genre. But what's making the Cloverfield franchise fascinating is how little we know about the creatures that are attacking the Earth. Maybe Cloverfield 3 can give us some more clues. <br/><br/>I'll give this nine puzzle pieces out of ten. From the producer mind of J.J. Abrams, comes a compelling thriller that seems to be a small part of a bigger story in a good way. 10 Cloverfield Lane is the rare sequel that manages to out do the original."

","Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean the threat isn't real. That's the theme of this film. <br/><br/>The point is made by our visceral experience as much as by any analysis. The film is one fright, dread, shock, surprise, after another. We're so exhausted at the end that we feel the emotional draining the Greeks expected of their tragedies â€” catharsis. We leave ""calm of mind, all passion spent."" We feel the validation of paranoia as much as we read it in the film.<br/><br/>The reality of fear makes this a very contemporary work. The US election is propelled by fear and its exploiters. So are the major flashpoints in world politics. <br/><br/>Hence the main characters. Howard is a brilliant technician, up on science and construction, but madly driven by conspiracy theory and survivalism. On his sanity we go back and forth. Is his fear justified or is he inventing the apocalypse in order to control his two captives?<br/><br/>Michelle is the particularly contemporary hero: a newly independent woman who grows into asserting herself. In the opening scene she leaves her boyfriend Ben. The car crash ends her independence. When she awakens after the accident she â€” and we â€” expect her sexual enslavement. Is this Son of Room?<br/><br/>Instead she serves Howard's need for a daughter figure. For all his powers Howard is a figure of impotence, averse to sexuality. In their word-guessing game he only thinks of Michelle as a girl or a princess, not a woman. Unlike the earlier captive, the girl Howard abducted and finally killed, Michelle survives by turning Howard's vat of acid against him. Later, when she fights off and destroys the vagina dentata monster from outer space, Michelle assumes the power and authority of the Sigourney Weaver heroine of Alien.<br/><br/>The fusion of earthly danger and sci-fi is especially significant here. When Michelle first breathes the safe outside air after her escape we share her relief â€” and her sense that she had been duped by Howard and his mad paranoia. For all his savvy he is a control freak and a lunatic. <br/><br/>The extra-terrestrial's attack proves Howard's mad theory was right after all. He's still a control freak, conspiracy theorist and brilliant madman. But he's defeated by the resourceful and newly assertive woman, who is the true hero for our times.<br/><br/>When Michelle and Emmett recall their regrets they both reveal their failure to have acted when they needed to. Emmett chickened out of going off to college on his track scholarship, resigning himself to a small life within a 40-mile radius. Michelle still feels guilty for not having interceded when she saw a man bully and punish his little daughter (as her father had abused her). Seeing Howard kill Emmett hardens Michelle's resolve not to fail to act this time. <br/><br/>Howard says he regrets nothing because he says he has done everything he wanted to. That denies his failure to have turned a captive girl into a daughter. But he has built that bunker. Taken together, the trio represent the two good people who having once failed to act surrendered the field to evil â€” and they won't do that now. <br/><br/>Michelle escapes and kills Howard, then blows up the alien. But for all her new found courage, strength and resourcefulness, her last decision poses a conundrum. On the radio she hears a call for survivors to come help out at the hospitals in Baton Rouge. Instead of heading there, though, she turns left toward Houston. Is she reverting to her earlier instinct not to get involved in others' suffering or is she instead heading off to her new independence and survival?<br/><br/>That's something to debate when we've recovered from this film's emotional and frightful ride."

","I saw ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", starring John Goodman-Love the Coopers, Speed Racer; Mary Elizabeth Winstead-A Good Day to Die Hard, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World and John Gallagher Jr.-The Newsroom_tv, Jonah Hex. <br/><br/>This is a weird movie to talk about. J. J. Abrams is the producer and said that he did not want the audience to know a lot about the movie before seeing it. He said that a lot of trailers give away the whole plot of a movie. That is why most people don't know much about the plot of this movie. Is it a sequel to Cloverfield? Well, it is related, but only loosely, at least so far. I say so far because once you see the ending, you know there will probably be a sequel and they could explain everything in it. This one is not shot using the hand-held camera gimmick from the first movie-Thank Goodness! There is also no giant creature terrorizing the city, although you do see a small creature of some kind, near the end. From what I could tell, this one also takes place several years after the first one. Mary is driving on a country road when she has an accident. She wakes up in an underground bunker chained to the wall. She finds out that John Goodman came across her crash site and brought her back to the bunker. He tells her that there is radiation outside from an unknown attack-Russians, Iranians, or maybe even Aliens?-and it is unsafe to leave the bunker. John Gallagher is also already in the bunker but not a prisoner. Slowly, Mary starts to feel that John Goodman may not be telling her the whole truth about his actions-he does act a little weird at times and his facts don't always make sense. FYI: When Mary gets a message from her boyfriend at the beginning of the movie you might want to see if you recognize the voice; it's Bradley Cooper. By the way, the title of the movie, 10 Cloverfield Lane, is the address of the bunker. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 43 minutes. I enjoyed it but I wished it had a better ending-Like I said earlier, I'm sure they are setting things up for the next installment-I would buy it on DVD."
"jmoneyjohal","7","0","3","11 March 2016"," A good psychological thriller about the unknown. John Goodman is amazing!
","10 Cloverfield Lane,is what I classify as a film about the unknown (aliens)its a film where the world is (sort of) coming to the end. And let me tell you weekly now Hollywood comes out with films, about aliens, and the end of the world, so with that one liner 10CL probably seems like yet another gimmicky, VFX heavy film, were the whole world is being destroyed, and everyone is dying until there is one saviour etc. But luckily 10CL separates its self from that mess, this film rather than relying on gimmicks builds tension through its characters,its more about surviving than fighting the unknown. Its an old fashioned thriller, that rather than scaring its audience, creates a paranoiac, cluster phobic eerie feeling in the audience. Its a realistic take on what the mynas predicted. But is the film worth a watch in theatres, well lets analyze.<br/><br/>Story wise Michelle packs her things and leaves her apartment, angry over a dispute with her partner Ben.While driving away she turns on the radio,it claims that there are numerous blackouts in major cities. Michelle becomes distracted after Ben calls her, and her car crashes and goes off the road from the distraction, flipping upside down. When she awakens, she discovers she is chained to the wall in an unknown location. After reaching her phone only to receive no signal, a man named Howard enters the room and tells her he saved her life and the world outside is now uninhabitable due to the nuclear or chemical fallout from ""an attack."" What happens next forms the films main crux.<br/><br/>Acting wise John Goodman is at his crazy maniac best. His act draws comparison to me to Christian Bale in American Psycho, and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, but to a lesser a extent obviously. Its a iconic role, of a crazy old man who will go to any extent to keep things as they are. Watch out for scene when he gets burned by acid, and his reaction. This might be his career best act. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is helpless, and in sorrow, and she conveys her emotions well with a pale look, and with her distraught eyes. In the climax when she escapes, and fights the unknown one roots for her to win, and thats how one knows she has succeed in her act. These above mentioned main characters are the main reason why 10CL is so enjoyable. John Gallagher Jr gives great comic relief.<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane is not a sequel to Cloverfield, its more of a franchise film I presume, with more films to come in the series with such a open ending. At a runtime of 1hr 45 min 10CL never gets slow or bores, the film builds tension perfectly, and the films first time director Dan Trachtenberg makes sure that films main set ""the bunker"" gives the audience a very cluster phobic feeling, and therefore the film gets your heart racing in panic at every thrilling instance. A example of this is the scene when Michelle steals the keys and tries to escape, but instead sees, a lady die in front of her due to the contaminated air. Its a scary thrilling moment.The film has a very dark, and eerie setting that works well with the films content. The films story and screenplay is not very novel, however the films presentation is very different than the usual world vs alien film. Here there is not many gimmicky effects or cheap graphic thrills, rather 10CL is a psychological thriller. The film is also greatly supported by the performances of the leads both John Goodman, and Mary Elizabeth are both extraordinary. I am usually am not a fan of films about the end of world but I quite enjoyed myself here. On the flip side, while 10CL is good and thrilling, the film just couldn't elevate itself from being good to extra ordinary till the pre climax/climax. And even the climax is rather unconvincing and leaves a sour taste in ones mouth. The film technically and production value wise is average, but this film is not supposed to be a very glossy film, so its adequate.<br/><br/>Overall 10 Cloverfield Lane is a good psychological thriller, that offers genuine scares. Great performances, and some thrilling moments make this film a recommended watch in theatres this week. Its a patch above the ordinary, and will definitely leave you with palpation's.<br/><br/>3.5/5* Grade: 74% B"
"MattBirk","8","0","2","11 March 2016"," An amazing mystery thriller, undermined by its ending
","I'll get this out of the way early, I firmly believe using the word 'Cloverfield' in the title was solely to sell tickets. There was no real need to draw comparison to 2008's Cloverfield. This movie could have been its own thing (and it probably would have been better for it).<br/><br/>As for this movie, it's pretty damn great! John Goodman is fantastic here, he's already got the body size to scare any sensible human being but his acting is certainly on point. He is a walking, talking, tension radiating, thug. At any single moment he can snap and the movie plays with this notion a lot! And to balance that out, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the likable, vulnerable damsel in distress if you will. Together the make a great duo for a very, very engrossing cat and mouse game.<br/><br/>Outside the praise of Goodman, it is the script that shines. There are some serious 'oh my god' moments that take things to the next level. Just when you think everything has been solved, the movie throws you another curveball to keep you guessing. Once the first 'bomb' (not literally) is dropped, the movie goes from a mild thriller to a bone-shaking puzzler. It's at this point of no return that the movie is most enjoyable as we watch the characters piece together their situation and we just sit back and watch the mayhem take over. I hope I'm not over-selling anything but the movie really does keep you on your toes!<br/><br/>10 Cloverfield Lane really came out of nowhere and that's always nice to see. It's certainly reminiscent of Joel Edgarton's The Gift. Not story wise, but both are a directorial debut featuring a mystery/thriller narrative. And they both received good reviews and critic response (eerily similar scores if you really break it down). It's really a pleasure to have modest expectations for a film, only to be blown away. This is one of those films, as long as you go into the movie knowing it's only a 'blood relative' to Cloverfield and nothing more."
"waltermwilliams","7","0","3","11 March 2016"," Not even Bovines are safe in Dan Trachtenbergs' feature directorial debut.
","Women imagine spinning out of control in a car accident, then waking up in an underground concrete bunker lying on a mattress in your underwear with your broken leg manacled by a chain and lock and your behind a steel door. Then you find it's occupied by two men, who claim the outside world is under attack by either the Russians or maybe Aliens. This is the world Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character Michelle finds herself transported to in the latest production of the genius JJ Abrahams. The premise is a slow burner at first,but things gain pace rapidly on a downhill slide to discover the mysteries that lie buried at this address. Not even Bovines are safe in this scenario created by Director Dan Trachtenberg. It's hard to believe this is his feature directorial debut. Unlike the original ""Cloverfield"" which was a huge shaky cam effort this movie could even work as a stage play with a tight knit cast on basically one set for the majority of the PG rated drama, mystery cum sci-fi flick. ""Lane"" could easily be some of John Goodman's best acting ever as the hauntingly crazy eyed Howard. It won't be at the Oscars next year, but it is a good story well told and relies on very few digital effects. If you go expecting a sequel to ""Cloverfield"" you may be disappointed, but if you approach this as part of a Twilight Zone series then enjoy...I did."
