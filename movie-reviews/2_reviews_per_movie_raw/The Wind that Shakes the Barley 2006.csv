","The remarkably low rating that this film has so far received (4.1 as of Thursday 8th of June) is indicative of its ability to raise the hackles of people who haven't even seen it. How can it be otherwise when the film has not yet been released? 135 people have voted; have all of these 135 people actually watched the film? Of course not. They're just voting on the basis of their perceptions or assumptions concerning its political agenda. IMDb voters are not alone in this; already Simon Heffer in The Daily Telegraph, Dominic Lawson in The Independent, Ruth Dudley-Edwards in The Daily Mail and Michael Gove in The Times are attacking a film they haven't seen (by their own admission). These attacks are the predictable reaction of empire apologists unable to abide the depiction of the dark and brutal underside of that imperial machine, or the suggestion that anyone on the receiving end of that brutality might be justified in rebelling against it. The title of Dudley-Edward's lazy hack-job says it all, really: 'Why does Ken Loach loathe his country?' Loach is a traitor, and must be punished, the rotter.<br/><br/>It's a pity that this political controversy seems poised to overwhelm discussion of the film, because it's an extremely able piece of cinema and deserves to be seen as such. Barry Ackroyd's cinematography is superb, ably capturing the beauty of the Irish countryside without indulging in it. We are rooted in a locale without being lavished with pretty pictures. The acting is also excellent. The charismatic Cillian Murphy carries the movie, but the support from Liam Cunningham, Orla Fitzgerald, Aidan O'Hare and Padraic Delaney is also commendable.<br/><br/>But it's the collaboration between Loach and his scriptwriter Paul Laverty that makes the film something like a masterpiece. The grim progress from the murder of an Irish youth to the growth of an armed I.R.A. campaign, with its attendant violence (shown in stark and horrifying detail) is expertly managed; the only let-up comes not far from the end, after the signing of the 1921 peace treaty. Loach tries to show the brief jubilation and relief that ensues, but in terms of momentum almost drops the ball. The pace is re-established in time for the inexorable tragic denouement, and the film's final emotional impact is considerable. The load is occasionally lightened by the odd touch of Loach's characteristic wry comedy, such as the belligerence of the opening hurling game, the teenage message-boy who loses his message, the melodramatic pianist accompanying the newsreel announcing the momentous news of the creation of the Free State.<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing scenes occurs when a group of I.R.A. men return from a successful battle and discover a farmhouse being attacked and destroyed by a group of British soldiers. The rebels, who have no ammunition left, are forced to look on, concealed in the bushes; they watch powerless as the farmhouse's inhabitants are abused. We watch along with the characters, just as helpless as they are. Why do we watch? Do we want to intervene, to play the hero and save the day? Do we perhaps enjoy it? The trouble with many so-called anti-war films, as Loach has said, is that they outwardly condemn the violence while at the same time encouraging (intentionally or not) a vicarious pleasure in the thrill of it all. We want to take part, we imagine how we would behave in such circumstances (of course, we usually imagine ourselves behaving with impeccable bravery and surviving to fight another day). This scene, rather than placing us in the thick of the action, forces us to occupy the position of impotent bystander. Perhaps this is what being a film-goer is all about: powerless voyeurism. As we watch the country tear itself apart in civil war, manipulated by a devious and callous colonial master, this point becomes all the more pertinent. A quietly devastating film."
"briandelaney","10","229","281","24 June 2006"," Great film
","This is a truly great film and well deserving of the Palm D'Or.<br/><br/>It has been said that it is pro IRA or IRA propaganda. I disagree. In fact I think the reverse is the case. It shows up both the brutality of war and the even greater brutality of civil war that sets nation against nation and brother against brother. The film provides an understanding of how Ireland became independent in 1920-1921. It is well documented (e.g. visit the BBC or CAIN websites) that the Black and Tans were a brutal and oppressive irregular force sent to put down the rebellion. The IRA reacted with similar brutality. The film records both with equally graphic scenes. But that is only the first half of the film. The second half deals with the civil war. That's even more tragic and brutal.<br/><br/>Who was on the right side or the wrong side? The film presents the arguments but I really don't think the film takes sides. More of the anti British and anti treaty argument is advanced. But this is understandable because it is historically accurate that West Cost was ferociously anti British and mainly anti treaty. That's why Michael Collins was destined to die there. And it is more important to understand why people/nations go to war or civil war rather than why they don't.<br/><br/>Understanding the reasons does not mean support for war. The film highlights the futility and awfulness of war. Misery destruction and death. Is there such a thing as a just war (apart from 2nd World war)? Aside from the historical debate, the story, filming and acting is magnificent. Much better than the Green Berets on the just war by USA in Vietnam! Blackhawk Down brilliantly covered Somalia from the external US perspective. This film brilliantly covers the 1920/21 wars from the Irish perspective. We need all perspectives.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing with an open mind. Then read the history if you want."

","An admirer of Ken Loach's unique style of film making, I say this is the best I've seen. His direction and techniques are now so finely tuned they sit almost subliminally behind a brutal but superlative story set in 1920s Ireland. I say 'almost' because I came out knowing I've never seen a film like this ever before, thanks to Loach.<br/><br/>Approach it as if you are about to watch a play. Listen intently to the dialogue complete with Cork accents depicting beautiful people forced into situations where they cross lines they cannot return over. Share in their juxtaposition of feelings of remorse with acts of war/self-preservation. In the horror of it all you might wish to be able to suspend disbelief in the fictional sense, but that'll be replaced with the overwhelming sense of truth and a not-so-long-ago reality. The individuals could be you or I at anytime and we take solace in the fact that perhaps we are among the lucky ones to have escaped this. Make space then to contemplate if, as a nation, we still effect this turmoil on others today. Remain with the story though. You feel as if you are there, smelling the turf in the air, privileged to be on the doorstep of the thatched residence that witnessed so many tragedies.<br/><br/>The character portrayals are mesmerising as Loach maximises body language; hesitancy, fear, stuttering and small moments of humour in his realistic approach. You already know each character before s/he speaks. But when they do speak, you are in the room with them agreeing or disagreeing - ready to pitch in if the moment were to present itself. As each personal struggle is revealed you again feel fortunate to have witnessed it. Simultaneously you feel relieved to be able to pull out and watch from a distance when more horror action scenes unfold.<br/><br/>This is true drama seeking no false gratification akin to other current films. Unstinting in its portrayal of the Brutish (not a spelling mistake) it is nevertheless universally significant and local at the same time. The photography is exquisite capturing timeless Ireland. The sound plays the noises of the times so well the viewers could imagine the scenes with their eyes closed.<br/><br/>As a Scot I am dismayed at the general poor response/reviews of the British press and I'm reminded that the British psyche has to learn to come to terms with its recent past. I wish that today we could transcend that and promote this film to ordinary people as an important film to see at some point in their lives. In future, any young adult asking me about the 'Irish problem' - I'll simply lend them my own personal DVD of this film and say ""watch this!"" It'll make it all the more easier for all of us to see the past and to avoid repeating it."
"shelliob","8","188","235","19 June 2006"," Sad tale
","An exciting piece of Ken Loach drama based on events that sparked the Irish war of independence. Despite being labelled 'anti-British' by critics born 60 years after these events took place, the incidents depicted in this film have in fact all been documented by the British government and are a matter of historical fact. Events such as the treatment of the local population at the brutal hands of the infamous convict drafted Black and tans force have all been recorded assiduously by both sides in the conflict. And the civil war that followed a decision to allow the mostly protestant north to be a part of the new British welfare state. A clash of ideals, deftly handled by Loach, it's a real pity that so many will have their minds made up before they've even seen the film."
"shayflanagan","10","104","133","14 July 2006"," A wonderful film
","An excellent film that outlines that tragic period of Irish history. Anyone wanting to understand the modern day troubles in Ireland MUST see this film to get a better understanding of things. I Thoroughly enjoyed this film and there was hardly a dry eye in the house by the end. It shows how easily communities, indeed families, were torn apart by divisions over the best way forward to achieve Irish freedom and how desperate people were. This is a film that should have been made years ago and should be viewed with an open mind by those who are not from a nationalist background. These events did occur and the time for denial is now % !<br/><br/>A first class film."

","OK so there's movies that you cry at...Bambi's mum dying, step mom, titanic etc but there is never going to be another movie that hits home like this. I cried so many times because it was so real. It is based on fact and contrary to the critics I don't believe there is any over exaggeration of the conditions and abuse that went on during this time. Not one member of the cast doesn't put everything into this piece and I have never seen such outstanding performances and truthful acting. Most blockbuster movies have actors trying to look pretty and interested...trying...but this has actors portraying people the way they were not the way that looks best! It is fantastic!!! It is also very educational but those looking for your traditional blockbuster movies turn away, this is for drama lovers, history lovers and those with a passion for true art!"
"caidyc","10","152","217","17 June 2006"," Historically accurate Visually stunning
","I saw this film at a private screening and found it difficult yet beautiful to watch. I have a personal history with the subject matter as I come from a family from both sides of the political divide in Ireland. A stigma that exists to this day but is reflected so profoundly with this film. Ken Loach's direction is crisp and perfect. The performances are, each and every one, incredibly believable and achingly visceral in the depiction of the conflicts of civil war. Cillian Murphy is wonderful and quite possibly the best Irish actor ever. Pádraic Delaney as his brother and enemy takes the role and makes it one of the best male performances I've seen. It is rare when a film allows you to understand both sides of a violent divide so clearly. The Wind that Shakes the Barley does this with blinding perfection. This film is a template for what film makers can achieve with a small budget, dedicated performers and a timeless topic.<br/><br/>Some who find this so provocative need to look further into their own loyalties to determine why the truth bothers them so much. Those who feel this to be Republican propaganda, ( and for you Americans I mean Irish Republican ), need, seriously, to investigate their own history. It doesn't surprise me that so many British people know nothing of their countries colonizing tactics in Ireland and elsewhere in the world. Six counties of Ireland still remain under British control. The sacrifices made 80 years ago still resonate today but the Republic of Ireland is now the third richest country in Europe. The question still debated is Was it Worth it? The question we ask is how's Scotland and Wales doing?"
"danmorris100","10","111","158","15 June 2006"," Go and see this film
","Another powerful movie from Ken Loach and a well deserved winner of the Palm D'or at Cannes. Some magical performances not only from the stars, but from the whole cast. I would urge you to find this film and go and see it. You will be educated, moved and it will leave you wanting to understand more.<br/><br/>From the start you feel as if you are in the 1920's and this feeling stays with you throughout. Obviously with a lower budget than most of the summers blockbusters, the film still manages to contain amazing action sequences and just has a wonderful atmosphere throughout.<br/><br/>Truly fantastic!"
"wdonovan-3","10","118","172","20 July 2006"," Was it worth it?
","""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" is a fantastic film, and extremely apt given the current socio-economic climate in Ireland. We seem to be losing part of our heritage everyday, once again slave to foreign influences (both sides of the water) and willing to lose sight of our past to embrace the future. I left the cinema in Navan, Co Meath, wondering to myself ""are we really as free as we think we are?"". We have the highest debt ratio per capita of any country in the EU, a cost of living that is spiraling ridiculously out of control and criminals that make the Manson family look like the Partridge family. So what did we fight for in the rising of 1916, the War of Independence and the Civil War? To be more like the British? The day of real patriotism is gone, it has been replaced by cash hungry capitalists willing to sell out in the name of progress. Back to the film! This was probably the first ""war film"" that I have seen that did not over step the mark in terms of taking sides. It was extremely objective and a credit to Ken Loach for the accuracy of his research and the depiction of the times. I would liken it, in some ways, to Mel Gibson's ""Passion of the Christ"" as it was really devoid of any sustained periods of levity and stayed constantly true to its theme, unconcerned by commercial considerations. A masterpiece of film making and a credit to the superb cast, particularly Murphy and Cunningham. Film of the Decade so far"
"andyhunt100","5","337","521","19 June 2006"," The truth hurts
","Saw it at private screening too.<br/><br/>Editorial from a Cork newspaper sums it up well:<br/><br/>This wind shakes more than barley<br/><br/>In Ireland we are in rare position internationally when it comes to our media. Most of what we read, listen to and watch is usually interpreted in two perspectives, through our own media and through that of our near neighbours across the Irish Sea. There are other instances of large and small neighbours with a common language (Germany and Austria; USA and Canada; Australia and New Zealand), but nowhere is the penetration of the larger nation's media into the neighbouring market as pronounced as it is in Ireland. Viewership of UK TV stations and readership of UK owned newspapers in Ireland is at a level that makes them as significant to our view of the world as our own media. This breeds a familiarity with our neighbours that can make us Irish assume the British know as much about us as we do about them. Nothing could be further from the truth however as has been graphically illustrated by the reception given in Britain to Ken Loach's Palme d'or winning movie The Wind that Shakes the Barley. There is no question that this film makes the British forces look bad, but of course the reality as all Irish people know is that they were. In the UK normally reasonable and intelligent reviewers and commentators cannot cope with this depiction of occupying British forces as violent repressors of a largely defenceless native population. It has been described as unbalanced and portraying the valiant British soldiers in an unfair and unflattering light. The truth is that the vast majority of British citizens couldn't tell you where Galway is and why should they? They're ignorance of their own colonial past so close to home and denial of it shouldn't surprise us; it is not something to be proud of. This is not to attack Britain, but to remind Irish readers of UK newspapers and viewers of UK television that Britain is indeed a foreign country. They view the world through an entirely different perspective than us, and in truth our views are inconsequential to them. That's why Loach's film, which tells essential truths, will not get a general release in the UK. Despite the fact that Anglo-Irish relations are probably better now than they have ever been the truth about Britain's history in Ireland is something that they just aren't ready for, and probably never will be."

","The only reason I gave this a 9 is because I gave MICHAEL COLLINS a 10 and it just isn't as good, after saying that this could be considered the flip side of the coin as we see what is going on in other parts of the country before and after the TREATY. we start off here with a bunch of lads in CORK running around like a hoard of elephants in work boots playing HURLEY, this is significant because the I.R.A were notorious for recruiting through the G.A.A, DAMIEN a local doctor played flawlessly by CILLIAN MURPHY doesn't share his brother TEDDY'S enthusiasm for the cause but a brutal unprovoked attack by the BLACK N TANS will set DAMIEN'S mind and his destiny on a new path.DAMIEN experiences the struggle first hand and the difficulty of recruiting poverty stricken rebels and the dire conditions of the training program were potential rebels train with HURLS instead of guns. DAMIEN gets consumed by the war and his role in it as his motivation grows with every effort, but when the TREATY splits the nation the two brothers find themselves torn and DAMIEN is questioning the cause once again. this movie is deep the BLACK N TAN brutality is visited repetitively and in gruesome fashion and there is a sympathetic angle for the rebels who at times are fighting even themselves, the movie is emotional at times through severe violence and the effort to sustain relationships under duress. a must see for this genre and very engaging, highly recommended."
"donalflynn2002","8","23","33","18 September 2006"," Some comments on technicalities
","My family came from Clonakilty and were directly involved in the events portrayed. The film struck an authentic note in portraying the young men and their fight. Of course the British forces were shown as monsters in the film as part of the mode of telling the tale, but growing up listening to the stories of the fighters, tales of atrocities did not feature.<br/><br/>The technical detail in the film was accurate and quite excellent and for that reason it may be of interest to point out three anomalies. <br/><br/>First: the men sung the present Irish National Anthem when they were held in the barracks and they sung it using Irish (Gaelic) words. In fact, the popular republican song which became the National Anthem was called The Soldiers' Song and the words were (of course)in English. They went:<br/><br/>Soldiers are we, Whose lives are pledged to Ireland, Some have come, From a land beyond the waves, Sworn to be free, Once more our ancient sire land, Etc<br/><br/>The Gaelic words were not written until ten or fifteen years later and were then promoted by Government as part of the fiction of Ireland being Gaelic speaking. When I was in school in the 1940's we learned the original English version and although nowadays the schools teach the Gaelic words, very few people retain them. <br/><br/>Second: after the men came in from the ambush they were fed at the farmhouse, eating from round bowls. I never saw such a dish in use in Ireland until people started going to Spain on their holidays in the 1960's. We used flat plated or flat-bottomed soup plates.<br/><br/>Third: When asked when he was leaving for England, the young doctor said ""at the weekend"". He would have said ""on Saturday"" or ""on Sunday"". The word ""weekend"" meaning a segment of time only arrived when the weekend became a defined segment of time. When small farmers worked a seven day week, they had no ""weekends"" and did not have a word for them in everyday usage. <br/><br/>My word for this film is 'evocative'and it with this sense that it should be watched."

","as a Englishman with little or no idea of the troubles that arose in Ireland from my school years education in the u.k. i have to agree with many of our Irish friends across the sea , we as a nation are kept in the dark about the the darker sides of our empirism especially as regards our close neighbor's the Irish , and after reading many books and studying the subject with a great deal of interest [ researching my girlfriends Irish descent in cork ] i feel that ken roach has again made a movie that will in time be classed as a true movie classic . history and fact are indeed hard to face when it does not paint a rosy a picture as we would all like , but the facts will always come to light albeit if it takes many years and this film gives a viewer an idea why many neutral Irish citizens were driven to join and fight with the i.r.a. in those troubled years , due mainly to heavy handed tactics and the attitude from Britain is it no wonder that 80% of the Irish populace voted for the sinn fein in the elections in Ireland in 1918 general election , and our then government decided that they would not allow this , now even with my ltd political understanding this does not sound democratic to me .the most powerful part for me in this movie is after the treaty is signed and we see the disagreement with the terms of the treaty and where brother ended up turning against brother , and then seeing Irishman fighting Irishman in a terrible civil war . you must see this film and if it sparks an interest as it did with me to delve further then it has succeeded , the acting albeit mainly unknown actors shows that under masterful direction and with what in this day and age is a substantially low budget can still achieve an remarkable piece of work that will be remembered far far longer than some of the so called big budgeted movies of this year , by far for me the best movie of the year and the most moving , i recommend it highly ."

","I must say that this film should have aroused some emotional response in me at some level. Unfortunately, it did not. Throughout, it fails to establish the characters as people you care about and the climax of the film with the episode between the brothers ought to be very moving. Because no proper relationship is established between them throughout the film, the ending leaves the audience feeling nothing. Far too much time was spent on showing the brutality of the 'Black and Tans'. We quickly get the message that they were violent, abusive thugs within the first twenty minutes. The rest of the time could have been more usefully spent on developing character and focussing on the far more interesting premise of the division of opinion and consequent violence between the Irish themselves as a result of the treaty to form the Free State. Instead, we get an hour and a half of rabid, screaming thuggery from the British and about half an hour to look at a vast and far reaching aspect of Irish history in the fight that pits brother against brother. A conflict of such bitter brutality needs to be shown in its full horror and I'm afraid that the deaths looked more like something from a village hall play in the way that they were sanitised. (Not a drop of blood from anyone who is shot!). This could have been a wonderful film, the cast, authenticity of locations etc... seemed very good. Unfortunately, I felt that it was oddly cold and lacking in emotional involvement. It added nothing to my knowledge of Irish history of the period. I am not an apologist for British behaviour in Ireland over the centuries. I am the son of Irish migrants and was born/brought up in England. I do however feel that the time spent on showing how villainous the British were was way out of proportion and overshadowed what could have been a story of great courage and bravery played out against the odds."

"bob the moo","Null","22","39","12 July 2007"," Solid but damaged by the slant towards the Republican point of view
","The English occupy Ireland with a brutal and harsh hand but Damien intends to pursue his medical career. However when a young friend is beaten to death for no reason, Damien decides to join up with the armed resistance to try and force the British out of Ireland. Somehow finding the stomach for the acts he commits, Damien follows his brother Teddy in the field, fighting side by side with one common aim. However, as some form of progress is made, the brothers (and the movement) find themselves splitting onto different, conflicting roads.<br/><br/>Let me deal with the big complaint first  that this is a pro-IRA, pro-terrorist film. Those making this argument in a strong way tend to be like myself and be from a Protestant background or at least have more knowledge of that side of the argument Conversely, those that claim that it is just a fair piece of history with no bias would tend to be the reverse. The truth is somewhere in the middle because, while the film is not supporting or totally justifying the IRA and terrorism, it does certainly excuse their actions to a point. Those who cannot see this are perhaps a bit too close or a bit too remote from the material  imagine the same film with Iraqi insurgents replacing the Irish and the USA replacing the British and you'll perhaps understand more why it is a touchy subject.<br/><br/>By having all the British be brutal but yet showing Damien killing because it is somehow the right thing to do, Loach cannot be surprised by such accusations? However this is not to say that the film is all that biased, because it does generally show the civil war as just as bad and just as pointlessly bloody; it is just a shame that it doesn't judge one side as harshly as it does the other  so when the Irish start killing their own, it is shown as something they hate, as opposed to all the British who actively enjoy doing it. It does still seem to condemn the violence of the land, but I must admit hoping for more from Loach  perhaps not a totally even hand because that is not what history tells us this was, but perhaps more depth that doesn't appear to put everything at the feet of the British. One could also question the aim of Loach in making this film late last year, at a time when the Northern Ireland peace process was still on the edge of disaster (although in fairness, anytime in the last decade one could say the same).<br/><br/>As director, Loach doesn't quite manage to produce the natural tone that is his style when he is on his game. However the performances are still pretty solid even if the characters do tend to be slanted towards being sympathetic. Murphy is perhaps the most guilty of this and this was a problem even though his cool presence is welcome here. Delaney works better as his brother, mainly because the material doesn't give him as easy a ride. The support cast are mostly solid enough although I do have a confession to make here and now. Despite being from Northern Ireland, I did have to put the subtitles on while watching it  not for every line but for sufficient difficult accents to make it worth doing. Given that I should have had more of a chance that, say, American viewers, this is probably worth baring in mind for the casual viewer.<br/><br/>Overall then this is a solid enough historical piece that does a so-so job of showing the violence and pointless bloodshed of the period and place. Although it is not a glory piece for the IRA, it does slant rather towards the Republicans as ""the good guys"", which was disappointing from Loach  not because I think the British are the good guys (they are not) but because anyone who knows the situation knows that one side is as bad as the other and it would have been nice for Loach to scale down the slightly romanticised view of his freedom fighters here."
"joegallaher99","7","13","21","30 July 2006"," Charts the story of British Black and Tan occupation and the chaos that follows.
","A mainstream cinema film on the Irish conflict has been a rarity up until now and with good reason. I can't help but feel that this film, had it been released ten or even five years ago, would have either compounded people's anger or been used for political capital. Now, with the troubles dwindling to an end, with the IRA more or less finished and with the issue well out of the general news, the coast was more or less clear to release a film about Ireland in the early twenties. That said, the fact that only thirty cinemas wished to show it in the UK due to its political content, conveys the fact that many still perceive the situation as tentative. This is the wrong stance to take in my opinion. Films such as these show that the Brits and the Irish consider these days to be history and that they are not afraid to talk about what went on. Being overly sensitive as to what people might feel hampers a long and complicated recovery process.<br/><br/>The film opens with a display of the brutal Black and Tan occupation. Even if you're a die hard nationalistic Brit, you can't help but feel for the Irish men and women and what they went through. A game of Gaelic football is regarded as a public meeting and therefore expressly prohibited by the Black and Tans. When one takes place they therefore respond by getting some of the players against a wall and ordering them to strip. When one 17 year-old refuses, he is bayoneted in a chicken coop. It is this disregard for human life that gets one to naturally side with the Irish during this part of the film and it led to a few English men and women next to me in the cinema joining in during the several Irish folk song interludes.<br/><br/>The film is not entirely sympathetic with the Irish however. A British soldier, played by the same guy as the monk in the third series of the Peep Show, says to an Irish prisoner that he was only sent by his government and then proceeds to describe the pain of the First World War in a fit of anger. It was refreshing to see that the script writers realised that not everything was black and white back then, or I suppose you could say, black and tan.<br/><br/>The film also displays a fascinating perspective on Winston Churchill. The man who we admire as our ultimate war hero, and the man whom we voted our greatest Briton, was in fact behind the sending in of the Black and Tans, in my opinion, one of our nation's darkest hours.<br/><br/>The Irish put up a very hard fought resistance to the Black and Tans and eventually force them out. The civil strife that follows however is frighteningly vivid. The changing of attitudes is depicted very well and movingly by brothers Teddy (Padraic Delaney) and Damien (Cillian Murphy). Both these actors put in excellent performances.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a very good film. A must see for anyone interested in the period or in the conflict in general, but one should perhaps be warned that the violence can at times be intense. My father's father was a young boy in Ireland when the Black and Tans came in and for my father, the film sometimes got a bit too much."

That martyrdom is still not enough to convince young promising doctor Damien O'Donovan (brilliantly played by Cillian Murphy) to swell the ranks of the fighters, among them his older brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) against the British colons. <br/><br/>We're all aware that in cinema's tradition it's not uncommon for the most valiant fighters to start as outsiders or even be labeled as cowards but Ken Loach doesn't use these narrative conventions at the expenses of realism. The episode that ends up triggering Damien's determination doesn't consist on another life-threatening situation yet it is far less than being anecdotic. On the train station, he sees the driver named Dan (Liam Cunnigham) being brutalized by British soldiers because he refused to transport them, nothing to do with Irish pride but union rights forbidding him to transport weapons.<br/><br/>This is interesting in the way it establishes the real motivations of Damien, he's not driven by romanticism but realism, and these nuances will play a gradually important role as the story progresses. Meanwhile, Ken Loach exposes the familiar elements such as the training of the troops, the first successful operations, the first sheds of blood with an attention to details that make each operation believable and heart-pounding in their unpredictable outcome. The performance of Murphy is crucial because we always identify with his outsider's status while his involvement gets deeper and his initial persona progressively diluted in the painful obligations. <br/><br/>There was a 1969 movie named ""Army of Shadows"" depicting with an eerie realism the existential corners a fight against occupation drove some ordinary men: executing a traitor with a towel, resigning to swallow a cyanide capsule or even worse, dying in total anonymity without any posthumous recognition whatsoever. But for all its grittiness, the movie didn't leave any doubt about the righteousness of the fight lead by French civilians for the enemy was the Nazi occupants, if it didn't make any death satisfying, we knew everyone did the 'right thing' even when it meant the worst.<br/><br/>Now, you have ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"", a movie all in bright palettes of green, nothing to do with the gray shadowy streets of Melville's masterpiece, but if this film that starts like your typical exhilaration of the fight for freedom, there is slowly but surely, in a way that credits Ken Loach' respect for his viewers, a gradual existential questioning. In a scene that echoes the traitor's execution in 'Shadows', Damien must shoot the friend who denounced them. At this point, you can see that it's a part of himself he's killing with the poor frightened kid and that there's no return to normality after that. <br/><br/>Indeed, we've seen sickening scenes of torture before, we know how violent the British were, but the film still allows his main protagonist to hope that Ireland will be worth the fight, this is no ""Braveheart""'. The execution is a poignant moment but what goes next is a triumph of writing and self-questioning. It consists on a long discussion about a verdict forcing a rich Irish man to pay a poor woman back because of high interest rates, this is the first judgment rendered by an independent Irish court but many fighters, including Damien's brother refuses to ostracize the richer ones as they're the most important fundraisers.<br/><br/>We can see the first breeches of discord within the group, some believe the fight needs money, some that the power must be given to the people. And what we've got here is a film that asks two questions: is the fight worth it after all, since it makes you kill your own people? Or will it be worth it since it will keep the same system just under a different flag. The question becomes crucial after the partition of Ireland and its dominion status maintained, causing a permanent shift between Loyalists and Nationalists and culminating when a man is forced to execute his own brother, remaking the very moment where Damien killed the traitor. Damien would recall the memory to point out that there's no possible bargain with him.<br/><br/>Damien's views seem politically motivated and Ken Loach was criticized for injecting his left-wing views within the story, but there's no doubt that there was starvation in Ireland and that a real ideological shift occurred within the fighters. And it says a lot about the misleading exhilaration of ""fighting"" when you believe in one enemy before you discover that it can be within your own nation, your own blood. There's a moment where the Loyalists mention that Britain needs to save face not to encourage other countries like India. At the end, I kept thinking of India and the sad aftermath of Gandhi's fight for the Independence with the Muslims and Hindus' civil war.<br/><br/>British criticized Ken Loach's self-loathing approach, in fact, he does justice to the two sides by confronting them to their historical responsibility, through a tragedy echoing a powerful line from another Golden Palm winner, Kusturica's ""Underground"": ""a war is not a war until the brother kills his brother""."

"Theo Robertson","8","10","17","4 June 2009"," Even Handed , Compelling And Loach's Best Film As Well As Being A Good History Lesson
","This comes with a lot of baggage but we can blame the director Ken Loach for that . I do remember seeing a panel at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival where Loach had a panel publicising HIDDEN AGENDA and continually shouted his mouth off about "" An army of occupation in Northern Ireland "" . The bitter irony was that film had very little if any IRA bias at least in comparison to Hollywood nonsense like THE DEVIL'S OWN . Tirades like that do Loach no favour since at least two critics attacked the film for anti British bias only to be found out that they'd not actually seen the film ! Loach has that effect on people and his "" socially aware realist dramas "" set on housing estates are very condescending and patronising which leave him open to attack , even by people who live on the mean streets and consider themselves left wing . In short it's very difficult indeed to watch a Loach film with an open mind which is a great shame because this is heads and shoulders above anything he's made before <br/><br/>The producers deserve great credit as does Paul Laverty for giving material for Loach to work with . Social realism is a style that is by definition low concept in nature , "" plot less "" in other words . THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY isn't the most plot driven screenplay in cinematic history but it is very involving and a very good history lesson , very much better than Neil Jordan's bio-pic MICHAEL COLLINS for example . Despite showing the violence meted out to innocent Irish bystanders by the crown forces there is a very important motivation that was fairly common amongst British soldiers at the time and that was unless they were Ulster protestants Irishmen never fought in the British army . This was an erroneous though common held view and we see this stated on screen . We also see that anti treaty IRA men had no compulsion in shooting Irish Free State troops <br/><br/>Some critics have argued that perhaps the film might have shown violence against protestant Anglo-Irishmen that did take place the Anglo-Irish War and the subsequent civil war that followed but that's to mistake the conflicts as wars of religion when in fact they were political conflicts . In 1919 the Irish population outside the six counties of Ulster was ten per cent protestant and IRA protestant membership was a similar percentage . Perhaps the resulting civil war could have been shown as being more brutal since the Irish Free State executed more IRA men than the Brits and had no qualms of shooting anti treaty IRA men after they'd surrendered but as far as history lessons go it would wrong to criticise a film such as this"

","Maybe my expectations of this film were too high, but I was very disappointed in it. It was beautifully filmed, but far too simplistic and full of the clichés about Ireland that I would have expected to find in a Hollywood dollar churner but not in a film by this director.<br/><br/>I have no axe to grind in terms of the political message of the film, indeed I agree with it, but I think most people who see this film would not leave with any deeper understanding of the issues it attempts to address. <br/><br/>The socialist argument was particularly badly handled, with a monologue by the trade union character (otherwise excellently portrayed) that reminded me of dreary political consciousness raising afternoons in seventies student unions. <br/><br/>The plot started out promisingly but turned into a predictable potboiler long before an ending that should have moved me, but didn't.<br/><br/>It was also full of lazy mistakes in terms of the sets, grass growing right up to the door of the house in a supposedly inhabited farmyard, moss growing on the chimney wall of a stone cabin that would have had a permanently burning peat fire, all the clothes too new looking - small details, I know, but very jarring when they occur in such numbers. <br/><br/>I'm very sad to say I've been warning my friends off this film."

","Being a fan of Loach's work, I was expecting to be gripped and blown away by this film. Sadly I was not. I was actually rather bored.<br/><br/>The chief problem with this film for me was the script - it felt like one long political and ideological lecture rather than the telling of an incredible story in the history of Ireland. It vacillates between a howling rage or an earnest debate, with no dramatic tension to make it work as a piece of cinema. The narrative flow and pace is absolutely all over the place, with a stop start momentum that makes the film incredibly hard to settle into.<br/><br/>Loach's trademark gallows humour is sadly lacking, and there is next to no character development, so it was very hard to care for the protagonists. The British soldiers were one dimensional cardboard cut outs and more pantomime villains than vicious oppressors.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is excellent, but I felt that Orlagh Fitzgerald's performance was all 'one- note', and Padraic Delaney as Teddy lacked the charisma and gravitas for someone who is supposed to be an inspirational leader.<br/><br/>Despite my criticism of the film I want to point out that I don't subscribe to the notion that this film is anti-British. The atrocities committed by the British government are well documented. We can't pretend that it didn't happen. This is just a very flawed depiction."

","One cannot accuse Ken Loach of familiarity or limitations. His films are bold be they small in scope as Sweet Sixteen or larger in scope as Land and Freedom. As to what one makes of The Wind That Shakes The Barley is something having seen Ken Loach's other work. Having set the film in the Ireland of the 1920s, a turbulent Ireland, and brought us into the lives of its protagonist brothers, the film starts offering something unique, personal and insightful only to become tediously slow and even dragging. Its high points come without emotional punch and feel like story telling by the numbers. The cinematography is too kitchen sink at time just as is the direction while the performances appear to fleet in and out as if one was actually watching a workshop on acting. I think winning a prestigious accolade is no measure of whether the movie is good or great because in this case it is only average."

","I have seen many of Loach films, and I like them, some a lot! But this one, stands out for being one-dimensional and with a sledgehammer-like rhetoric.<br/><br/>So what do I mean? We get to follow a young man through the film, who only after five minutes into the film becomes convinced that an armed struggle is the best way to beat the oppression. Then the film follows his violent actions. And after many minutes (some with very masochistic and self-sacrificing violence) the British occupation force is ousted.<br/><br/>Now (at last) the film is getting ready to address issues of greater difficulty, because suddenly with the disappearance of the common enemy, the fighters start to disagree. Should the fight continue until a worker's socialist republic is formed, or should a liberal democracy with some ties to the British (but not occupied) be accepted? Our protagonist chooses the former option. At this point in the film (unless the repetitive first hour and a half has bored you completely) the real challenge to the audience could be given: how can a people with different opinions on how to live and structure society, reach a common ground for their mutual existence, how should a socialist state deal with persons that does not want to join the collective, now when their occupier has left? The film has a clear answer: they are traitors, lets fight to the End! Here the personal drama, which is where Loach has his great power, is substituted for very simple political discourse. No intellectual ""tension"" is built up because the answer appears so simple... FIGHT! <br/><br/>And the ending... so masochistic! You almost wonder if the violence is the (erotic?) force of the film. Of all films Loach has made over the years, that this one would win in Cannes... well, you can not help but question the taste of the jury!"

The reality however is that this is exactly what happened. In fact the British committed atrocities far worse than this throughout the British empire.<br/><br/>People who ignore history are doomed to repeat it's mistakes. No one is blaming britons today for what happened back then, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

I cannot call myself a real movie-goer but I have studied Irish history and have taught it at University level here in France, so my recriminations will focus on this aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>It is true that the photography is superb, and that the actors are excellent, but I don't think this is enough to turn a movie into a masterpiece. My main criticism would be about the unbelievable simplicity of the confrontation: to put it in a few words, how come all British characters in the movie are cruel roaring idiots and all Irish characters able arguers ? Surely Mister Loach history cannot be that simple. I would also say that the movie itself is rather slow-paced (which is not always negative) and some scenes are so obviously didactic that it sounds like once more K. Loach is trying to teach someone a lesson. The starving child scene is a very good example. On the positive side, as mentioned, I will retain the excellent acting by most, if not all the actors, and the superb scenery that are used and not abused. One question now: I thought men and women could not sit together at mass at the time, especially 80+ years ago, am I wrong ?"

Otherwise, this was a very poor film: basically an exploitation movie harping on stereotypes. Endless repetitive scenes of violence. I couldn't follow the story except in the broadest outline, so I left the cinema knowing no more than when I went in. The characters were cardboard cutout stereotypes of romantic revolutionaries and their long-suffering womenfolk. The Brits were caricatured as the worst stereotype of the Black 'n Tans.

Despite the beautiful Irish landscapes available the movie disappointingly uses mostly close shots. Plot advance is painfully slow.

","For the past thirty years I have had a love affair with Ireland and over this time it has never failed to surprise, delight and humble me. This last weekend, much to my surprise, a small town cinema in deepest Hampshire, chose to screen 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley'. I am not sure of its motives for doing so but it brought to this small Saturday evening English audience a stark reminder about the brutality of its colonial past and its recent mistreatment of one of its nearest neighbours. For me the beauty of this film is in its honest portrayal of the momentous events that took place as seen through the eyes of a small Irish community. What is not lost is the knowledge that these same actions, tensions and emotions are taking place in every other community throughout Ireland at this time and it is this common purpose that in the end provides the momentum that forces change. The film does not shy away from the level of brutality that is required to force this change through. For me the uncompromising use of dialect reinforces the small community aspect and constantly acts as a reminder to us English that the Irish were, and still are, culturally different from us and are proud of it. So, if you want to see for yourself then look up your local sleepy cinema and you may be as surprised as I was.<br/><br/>For me the film had an added dimension in that the same catalogue of events are still being played out on the world stage today wherever you have dominance by a colonial power over its neighbour. The same resistance builds against suppression and the common purpose creates the conditions for change. Once the realisation is understood that change is achievable the common purpose takes second place to the aspirations of various factions and the momentum falters while it turns in on itself and the bitter struggle for dominance is played out. This struggle may end in civil war, partition or both. Meanwhile, the colonial power endeavours to try to influence the outcome. Such are the dynamics of the human condition."

","Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! Granted the good word I had heard about this movie had indeed come from those who would at least sympathise with the Republican movement but, to be honest, I was nonetheless looking forward to seeing this movie which was to be a no-nonsense film shot in the very county in Ireland in which I grew up. I was wide of the mark in my ignorant optimism and how dull was the resulting pain in my head after viewing this.<br/><br/>When one sees a movie such as, say, ""The Dukes of Hazzard"", one enters the cinema with expectations set rather low and is thus rarely disappointed. ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" had presented itself as something more and the bar had been raised appropriately. It merely a pity that, to me, the bar was to be vaulted over and not, as this movie excelled at doing, limbo-danced under.<br/><br/>The acting, directing, cinematography, script, editing, sound and plot were all poor, albeit with a few exceptions in the acting department. I do however get the feeling that some actors were directed to stutter their lines in an effort to make the dialogue seem more real but this only resulted in the poor lines jarring even further. In fairness to the actors, there were no characters to work with in this effort, only stereotypes.<br/><br/>Some points of note: - the amateur camera-work when panning left and right and up and down and left and up and down and right when the main house of the movie is set on fire - the primary school-like debate on the issues in an office - the main character moaning how he had tried to avoid getting involved in the war but couldn't and then tried to get out but couldn't. Rubbish! His friend was killed but he was to leave for London. What stopped him was seeing a train driver get a bit duffed up for refusing to carry soldiers! He made zero attempt to leave the war - none! - the simplified version of events around the shelling of Republicans in Dublin's Four Courts was almost funny.<br/><br/>I hope I never have to watch this movie again and not because of its harrowing drama, which is sadly lacking, but because it was one of those movies where I almost walked out for the first time. To shoot a movie in a beautiful area, such as West Cork, and for none of it to come through on-screen is truly a remarkable feat. How this won a prize in Cannes is anyone's guess.

","""Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow"" wrote James Joyce. Well, a lot of us Irish piglets have managed to escape the maternal jaws and prosper abroad. A film like this, on the Irish war of independence (1919-21) and the even bloodier civil war which followed it (1922-23), is thus both remote and yet oddly personal. Ken Loach's take on these battles, forgotten in Britain but well remembered in Ireland, is not even-handed, but he is a movie maker, and a very good one, not an historian.<br/><br/>The central character played convincingly by Cillian Murphy is Damien, rather improbably a medical graduate from a village near Cork, who is about to go off to work in a leading London Hospital. He is persuaded to stay and joint the local IRA column commanded by his brother Teddy after witnessing a couple of petty atrocities committed by the British forces, the Black and Tans. The IRA steal weapons from Army depots, ambush British columns, shoot informers, and bring down on the general population reprisals which have a ferocity which far outweighs the IRA's mayhem. The population, having had enough, vote in favour of a peace treaty, which excludes Northern Ireland from the new Irish State, but the hard men of the IRA, some of them socialists as well as Nationalists, go on fighting, this time against some of their own former comrades, in Daniel's case against his own brother.<br/><br/>Ken Loach tells his story simply and vividly, with not a surplus scene, though he allows some of his characters lengthy and didactic speeches. He goes for authenticity in the lighting, which means greens and browns dominate almost every scene. (We could have done with some sub-titles  the soft Cork accents are difficult even for another Irishman to hear.) His characters, though, tend to be types rather than people, Damien the idealist, Teddy the pragmatist  they are not rounded out characters but vehicles for the argument. What Loach does get across (though I am not sure he intended to) is the inevitability of the tragedy of the civil war.<br/><br/>The pro-treaty party won the civil war, but nearly a century later the dispute remains alive. Ironically, the South is now ridiculously prosperous while the North still languishes economically. Ironically also, parts of the anti-treaty party (Fianna Fail) under Eamon de Valera survived to become a dominant force in Southern Irish politics. Loach's account of the 1920-22 period is both a clear statement of the issues and an evocation of how it must have felt to have been involved. We Piglets can feel what our grandparents must have felt when the IRA and the Black and Tans came by."

Granted, some movies just can't afford and big, theatrical effects, but the inconsistency and utter lack of care for any sort of realism made me very upset. And by lack of consistency, I mean, why is there a lake of blood when someone is punched in the face, yet a man facing a firing squad simply slumps over against the post to which he is bound?

","Well made film of course, good acting and powerful scenes.<br/><br/>However, it is so biased towards the IRA that it is little more than propaganda. The core problem of Catholic Irish against Protestant Irish is virtually ignored. The British would have been happy to get out of Ireland completely years ago were it not for this intractable divide amongst the Irish themselves.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the heroic IRA and the wicked British is so cartoonish, I'm surprised the IRA are not in white hats and the British in black.<br/><br/>The modern tendency to always think that rebels of any sort are in the right is indicative of the shallowness of contemporary political thought. Can we look forward to films portraying the heroic al-Qaeda?"

","Apparently there have been savage reviews of this film by professional critics, presumably of the right-wing press, some of whom admit, laughably, to having not seen the film. Such a reaction is truly shocking. I didn't find the film 'anti-British' in any way, there is brutality on all sides here and I found my sympathies shifting back and forth throughout the duration of the picture. The political situation is depicted with commendable nuance, the realisation that in real life (as opposed to Hollywood life) there are no easy solutions, no categorical good and bad, real life is messy, complicated, dirty, both tragic and comic; people often don't have the time for much thought and certainly don't have the benefit of comfortable hindsight. If the film is 'anti' anything it is anti-political dogma of whatever creed.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why some people regard this film as an allegory, or metaphor, for what is currently going on in Iraq. So be it. It is a mark of any true work of art that it lends itself to multiple interpretation, a layering of meaning and content, resistant to any simple message. This is a fine piece of work by a director at the top of his game."

","In short, I fell asleep while watching this film. If you have an intricate knowledge of the Irish troubles and all the political goings-on of that time, I'm sure this film will be fascinating for you.<br/><br/>The problem is that Ken Loach assumes that everyone watching has such a knowledge, and as a result its very difficult to get without such extensive knowledge.<br/><br/>I do like Cillian Murphy and thought he was pretty good in this, but its a film that expects too much of its audience, and consequently blocks a lot of them from enjoying the film.

"cliffhanley_","9","14","33","26 June 2006"," A classic tragedy without time or borders
","The critics who dismiss Ken Loach as a mere polemicist tend to be the ones who violently disagree with his socio-political standpoint, and he would have good reason to feel worried if The Sun or The Daily Mail hailed the release of a Loach film with a barrage of glowing encomiums. The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a companion to Land and Freedom, the study of the Spanish people's fight against powerful and totalitarian rulers, just as that struggle splits into civil war. It is specifically about British imperialism in Ireland, but it could be set in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Palestine or of course Iraq. In the same way The Navigators depicted privatisation from the point of view of the railway workers, The Wind keeps to the level of the 'common people' - those who have to fight just to survive, and by default become soldiers. By concentrating on two brothers: young doctor Damien (Cillian Murphy) and the already-committed fighter Teddy (Padraic Delaney), Loach, by making it personal makes it even more universal. One brother, having irrevocably given himself to the struggle by killing a 'traitor' who is little more than a frightened boy, cannot give it up as to do so would be to admit that that horrible and tragic sacrifice was pointless, as it could only be justified if it led to the creation of a free republic; the other brother equally fixed in his route, but through his military experience enters the empirical world of political compromise. It leads to classic tragedy. Although the story is built on a strongly historical scaffold, the complexities of family life and a turbulent society give it great depth and emotional pull. There are no two-dimensioned goodies or baddies. The simple farmers simultaneously kill and find ways to justify their killing; the Black and Tans, certainly depicted as brutal, are angry, desperate, frightened too. Many would have been fresh from the trenches of the Great War, where they were trained to hate and kill and would be bent on revenge on the enemy; any enemy. There is another strand here, another story: these men, fighting for the 'English' empire, were protestants, many from Glasgow, to where they returned and propagated blind hatred of all 'papes', and that poison thrives today among their grandchildren. The many conflicting interests, cruelties, hopes, mistakes, inevitabilities for the Irish have also rooted in society, while they flower in melancholy and romantic bitterness on the surface. You can gauge the health of any state by looking for its critics. Loach happens to be a great film-maker but for his regular doses of the medicine we need he deserves his Palme d'Or, and we should be grateful to the French for that recognition."
"Simon_Bocanegra","3","10","22","27 August 2006"," Loach lays a wooden egg
","With a talented cast, gorgeous scenery and cinematography, and a sure-fire conflict story based on recent history, one would think this film would be a sure-fire smash hit....especially if one goes by other IMDb reviews. Maybe I just watched an alternative-universe version, or my chair angle was wrong, but what I saw did not nearly do justice to a story deserving of being told, and told well. It missed, not by an inch, more by a mile, Padraic.<br/><br/>Perhaps Ken Loach is trying to portray a tight-lipped, understated desperation among his characters, but all I got was a lot of screaming, shooting, and screen hostility, like a college production. I never really saw the tension. Sure, there's the senseless beating death in the beginning that catalyzes the village boys to take up arms....but it's impersonal, boorish, and over way too quick, and never gets near the evil impersonality of, say, Ralph Fiennes in Schindler. And the sentiment in Southern Ireland was exactly akin, that the British saw them as inferior, unruly savages to be treated as such. The historical occupation says at least as much about the British as it does the Irish. And of course, English viewers will be naturally uncomfortable, because what they remember most is the brutal IRA bombings of recent history.<br/><br/>We all(in America) know of the dogged determinism of Winston Churchill rallying England against the Germans, but we are never told the sobering fact that Churchill and Downing Street and the British Crown were so hated by the Irish that many were neutral when it came to World War II. <br/><br/>Cillian Murphy, as Damian- the same actor who pulled off a 2-hour intensely captivating monologue in Breakfast on Pluto- an almost unthinkable acting feat- turns in a mostly wooden performance in this, seemingly going through the motions of the passionate would-be doctor turned patriot, as do the rest of the cast. No close-ups to reveal thought and emotion processes, although the fingernail-pull is plenty close.<br/><br/>We're not sure or maybe even aware that Teddy and Damian are brothers- where's the buildup to all the relationships? Gone is where. Where's the history of their dads and granddads being crushed generation after generation by the Crown? Of the rich Knighted landowners ruling their lands, ""gifts of the Crown for services rendered""- oppressing the locals-? Of the Catholic Church and its conflicted role in the Irish misery? missing, missing, missing.<br/><br/>The story seems like a gimme, but I don't know- maybe it was the direction or pace, or maybe Ken Loach presumes that the rest of the world knows the story like the Irish do. Probably a combination of the above, because it never captures the gut passion of so many levels of conflict that the original story has to offer. And that is a shame.<br/><br/>The ending is anti-climactic and I wonder if Loach is aiming for a documentary-drama style. That misses also.<br/><br/>I think of Mickeybo and Me, shot in a time-frame 50 years later, and in Belfast- but utterly grabbing the viewer with its presentation of childish innocence and even studied escapism amidst tragedy.<br/><br/>Everyone seemingly walks through their lines, perhaps convinced that such a passionate story will tell itself- maybe the director told them all exactly that, but guess what? You still have to go out and play the game, as they say, and I think this one was lost."

The scene where they take Chris, who is the head off the Gooch by the way, out into a field to be shot had me in tears.

A proof of that is his characters getting more and more uncomplicated.<br/><br/>This is about a rather forgotten part of European 20th century history, the Irish rebellion. As he's done before, Loach gives us history through the individuals. Two brothers first fight the British, than fight themselves, being on different sides in the civil war.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say that this very fast comes down to a 50s western film level. The theme is about honor, glory and not selling your ideals out. In fact, it would have been much more interesting if Loach had concentrated on the Irish conflict between enterprise and workers instead. There's a lame try to do that here, but the focus is on a rather one-dimensional struggle between two brothers.

It must be said on the British did not conduct themselves with gallantry during this period either, it was a fight to the death with no quarter given. The difference been that since then Irish people are fully versed on this period in history,eg the reasons why, for how long and who was involved In the UK however, this period is sanitised or removed from history, maybe because it's too close to home.

","The Wind That Shakes The Barley is a very ambivalent movie. I could write several pages about its pros and cons, but I'll try to be more concise here.<br/><br/>TWTSTB laudably deals with an underdealt historical topic, it tries to address a plethora of subjects and tries to be even-handed. And it absolutely isn't, by the way, anti-British. Maybe it's pro-Irish, but that isn't a crime.<br/><br/>From an artistic-technical point of view, the movie is flawed in such a way as to make it somewhat long-winded and boring. Probably the main mistake is that it tries to achieve far too much, that it tries to be too balanced and multi-faceted and thorough. Although this attitude certainly suits its very complex and somewhat ignored subject matter, and would be laudable in a 10-hour TV docu-series, in a two-hour cinema movie it just doesn't fly. Loach should have tried to focus on one or two aspects of the conflict instead.<br/><br/>Then Loach completely fails to build up his characters. Instead he shows us an excessively violent crime being committed by the British right at the beginning, probably to let us know right off the bat which side he's on (erm ... we already guessed, Ken), which casts a propagandistic pall over the entire movie.<br/><br/>I didn't really enjoy watching this movie, but it made me reread about the Irish interbellum struggle, and so did me some good after all."
"eastbergholt2002","6","7","15","1 April 2007"," Marxist history lesson
","As a Brit, I'm not sure what to make of Ken Loach's The Wind That Shakes the Barley. The film is set in Ireland in 1920 and the film starts by showing life in a peaceful and idyllic Irish village. British soldiers arrive and start taunting the villagers. They kill someone who objects to their presence and no explanation is given for the brutality. It is implied that Britain operates an evil and sadistic empire. However, the film omits to explain that the Irish War of Independence began in January 1919 and the Irish Republican Army had organized a guerrilla campaign. Atrocities were committed on both sides.<br/><br/>Damien (Cillian Murphy) is a young doctor who was about to leave for a career in London. After observing the cruelty of the British he joins the IRA and becomes a terrorist / freedom fighter. His brother, Teddy (Padraic Delaney) becomes a local IRA leader and they kill Brits together. In 1921, Michael Collins signs a truce with the British, which leads to the Anglo-Irish Treaty. This established the Irish Free State and resulted in the partition of the country. It gave Ireland a status equivalent to that enjoyed by Canada and Australia.<br/><br/>British troops are shown leaving the village and the Irish Civil War starts soon after. The IRA objected to retaining constitutional links with the UK and opposed the six counties in the north remaining under British control. Damien and Teddy choose different sides. Damien's friends in the IRA insist that the ""people"" should own the means of production. Damien wants a Marxist state while Teddy is a pragmatist. History seems to side with Teddy. The Protestant majority in the north regarded themselves as British and were prepared to fight to remain part of the UK. Southern Ireland won complete independence in the 1930s.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have much of a plot, but there is plenty of violence, hysteria and politics. By focusing on life in the village you don't obtain a broader understanding of the struggle. The film provides a confused history of events and the production is annoying and dishonest. The filmmakers still seem to believe in Marxism."

","This gets 2/10 from me for the nice shots of the Irish countryside, and that's about what it is worth. As a film, they need to go back to the drawing-board. The acting is juvenile. The story is trite, and tritely written. And the film's direction does nothing to alleviate these flaws. As has been said on this board, the characterization in this film is superficial, one-dimensional, and stereotypical. The British in Ireland are portrayed as nasty and malicious, and no doubt they were, but they are portrayed stereotypically so, and one thinks that there must have been more to them than that. And the Irish are portrayed with a kind of inverted condescension.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was clear to this viewer that The Wind That Shakes the Barley is rather lacking in historical and social depth. I realize that historically-set films must necessarily simplify and compress historical events for the sake of time-action continuity and are allowed a certain artistic licence with historical facts, but TWTSTB oversimplifies and guts necessary historical facts, and embellishes the hell out of those that remain, making the whole film shallow and tediously biased. Indeed, all I can say is that this film is rather lacking all round, except for some good shots of the countryside, as I have said. In short, it is a case of nice photography, but poor cinema."

"Jazzist-H-Crisp","2","8","18","6 October 2009"," This film endorses violence for political ends
","The key scene in this film is where Loach tries to justify siding with the Die-Hards in 1922. The Treaty had been approved by a majority in the Dail and the people of Ireland, North and South, voted 2 to 1 for the Pro-Treay candidates versus the Anti-Treay candidates. The Treaty therefore had democratic backing, but the Die-Hards decided to fight on, to take by force what they could not achieve by political means.<br/><br/>Most people would say that terrorists who ignore democratic decisions and inflict violence on others to impose their will on them, are fascists. Loach, however, takes their side in his incredibly selective (with the facts) and biased film. To hell with democracy, in other words, let's use murder and brute force to achieve our goal.<br/><br/>Loach presents the justification in the scene where the priest tells the congregation that the Treaty has been voted on and so it should be respected as the democratic decision of the people. Damien, our young hero, does not agree. ""The Treaty does not express the will of the people; it shows the fear of the people."" And that is it. That is all the argument that is needed to trample down a democratic decision.<br/><br/>Damien picks up his rifle and goes off to kill some of the Staters who support the Treaty. And we are meant to approve of that! Loach wants us to side with the fascist thugs, the Die-Hards, who would not accept the democratically agreed settlement of the Treaty and tried to murder their way to a 32-county socialist utopia. Loach does not care that the Treaty was a negotiated settlement which satisfied both ends of the island: the South got its independence and the North retained its link with Britain. He wants to bludgeon the North into acceptance. He does not acknowledge the wishes of the Northern Protestants once in his biased, narrow-minded version of events.<br/><br/>What is the message that Loach sends out to the fascists and terrorists of today? Clearly, he does not care that the Good Friday Agreement achieved the backing of 80% of the population of Ireland, North and South. The GFA is no better than the Treaty of 1922. It is a democratic, negotiated settlement, but fascists have no regard for such niceties. The present IRA have laid down their arms and are now pursuing constitutional politics. Loach must think that they should have fought on, planting bombs and murdering policemen, as their fanatical counterparts, the unreconstructed fascists of the Real IRA, are still doing. They are carrying on the brute-force tradition of the Die-Hards. They are trying to force the Northern Protestants into a united Catholic Ireland with terrorism. Does Ken Loach applaud their fascist atrocities? He does not disown them."

","THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARELY is about two brothers who fight the British in the Irish War of Independence and then each other over the Anglo-Irish Treaty.<br/><br/>The interesting thing about Ken Loach's career is that he just isn't a very good film-maker (as this film proves). His success lies in holding the 'correct' views of the Left-wing arts establishment and expressing those views on screen. It comes as no surprise therefore that this film is wholly one-sided, to the point of becoming propaganda.<br/><br/>So, unsurprisingly, the Brits are all thugs whose only ability to interact with the Irish is to shoot them, beat them, torture them or shout and swear at them. Loach has been accused of Anglophobia and sadly this seems accurate. All the Brits, and Anglo-Irish, have English accents and are brutal oppressors or exploiters. Whilst the only British character to be portrayed in a sympathetic light is Scots-Irish (and a traitor). None of the British have any depth to their character; they are mere cardboard cut-outs whose actions exist entirely to justify those of the plucky Irish rebels.<br/><br/>The Irish meanwhile are lovable types with charming cottages and folk music. It is only when the Treaty is signed that any degree of complexity is shown as the brother's Flying Column splits in opposition to or in support of it. Loach's only sign of dissent with the heroic, romantic tradition of Irish historiography about the wars is to suggest that they were not nationalist but social (the main character is a Marxist).<br/><br/>A quick note must be made of the dreadful audio in this film. The Irish characters all mutter whilst the British all shout. Combined with poor audio quality this makes many conversations extremely difficult to hear. The acting is quite clearly a mixture of professional and amateur but is effective enough, with the exception of those actors portraying the Brits, who constantly over-act. In fairness to them, I imagine this is what Ken Loach wanted of them. The camera-work is competent but Loach clearly finds it difficult to deal with more than a handful of people of screen. His larger scenes are often confused or poor. He also suffers from the repetitious nature of the screenplay which forces him to repeat very similar scenes.<br/><br/>This is precisely the sort of one-sided war film that would be shouted down in the Left-wing press if the heroes were Brits or Yanks. The nearest comparison are the jingoistic and simplistic war films that John Wayne starred in during the 1950's- only they were better made."

I did not link it solely to Ireland; the occupying army might have been the Russians in Chechnya or the ""coalition of the willing"" in Iraq for all it would have changed; we are shown a precise description of what happens when an occupying army is bound by no law and the occupied choose active fighting.

The Irish are mainly ""Gaels"" who invaded the British Isles from ""Galicia"" about the same time as the English, i.e as the Roman empire broke up; and also Danes who raided and then invaded later in the Dark Ages ( and founded Dublin; Cork; Belfast etc as bases for their slaving and pillaging raids).<br/><br/>The Irish were the greatest slave kidnappers and traders in Western Europe for almost a millennium(the most famous ""Irishman"", St Patrick, was a British slave). One of the names for the Irish in Welsh (i.e British) means ""slaver"".<br/><br/>After conquering Ireland and dealing with the Danes the Gaels then invaded Scotland; conquered the native British and then turned north and conquered the Picts; and then turned south to invade what is now England, but met and were eventually defeated by the English, but not before they sacked the great center of Roman culture and second city, York, and raped and pillaged across most of the Midlands and North.<br/><br/>There is little left of the pre-Gaelic people in Ireland or Scotland except for place names (Aber; Insh') and their culture was usurped as Irish (Brasil; Tristan/Isolde; Mabinogian myths) Q2. Why did the President of the Ireland walk several blocks to the German Embassy to personally sign condolences on the death of Hitler? Although born in the US he did not do the same a few weeks earlier when Rossevelt died.<br/><br/>Why did Ireland make constant strong diplomatic objections and political lobbying during WW11 to the US about US planes and ships which strayed into Irish air/sea space or which were forced to land? The Irish were pro-Nazi not just anti-English; why else did they refuse to help the Americans? I am not English; I am of Irish Catholic origin; just believe in balance and fair play.<br/><br/>Paul Connolly"

","This movie is half an hour too long. It rattles along as we follow the adventures of the good guys (young idealistic Irish freedom fighters) in their struggle to rid their land of the hated British oppressors. Loach should have ended the film with the peace agreement of 1922 that gave most Irish people what they wanted - independence in all but name - but failed to satisfy a minority of ideological socialists who then continued the struggle but now against their own kith and kin.<br/><br/>The film completely loses its way towards the end with too much political debate and a frankly ludicrous schism between the brothers who are the two central characters leading to one ordering the execution of the other.<br/><br/>The film completely fails to engage on an emotional level with the result that the supposed climax is a total letdown.<br/><br/>Loach does action scenes well and the scenery is beautiful. Unfortunately he can not resist the opportunity to indulge in heavy-handed political lecturing and he really can't do emotion!"

","I didn't notice a single close-up in the entire movie. This sort of film-making is disquieting at first, but the eyes adapt to it, and it works thematically. It establishes a collectivity among the characters. They don't function as individuals (as stars), but together as part of an ensemble, a movement. They're interpreted not on their own terms but in terms of the landscape, the town, etc., each of them a part of something bigger.<br/><br/>The concept of war played out remotely is interesting. The British are unwitting cogs in the machine, unaware of why they're fighting. There's a frightening sense of disconnect between the general revolution and the small happenings in this town. It's an interesting look at the phenomenon. All wars are a part of something bigger. The only time we see the actual source of conflict is when they watch the newsreel -- a nice cinematic touch.<br/><br/>The camera is tremulous, it moves precariously. The dialogue is beautifully crafted. The acting is wonderful. The picture seems perpetually tinged with gray-green, and that Irish feel that a storm is always coming persists.<br/><br/>The character development isn't great. Cillian's transformation seemed forced, rushed. The only arc that really develops is the character of the collective resistance. That's the protagonist of this movie, not any single player in it. Very cleverly done."

","Depending on your political leanings this film will attract the usual comments of it been Anti British or it will favour a republican stance. But looking at the film it shows the brutality of both sides in that it covers the Civil War side which employed equally brutal tactics as that of the British. The film may have tended to show more of the actions of the Auxies rather than that of the Tans who were attached to the R.I.C and who were more numerous than the Auxies and probably much more active. The political arguments in my opinion were probably more one sided to the anti treaty people but from my point of view and maybe Ken didn't mean it this way? there was brutality on all sides."
"Nathars","10","10","27","3 July 2006"," Dramatic, Allegoric, Human, Realistic, Cerebral, Emotional
","A work of cinematic brilliance. Will be difficult viewing for many, especially non-Irish I think. It is/will be controversial for political but not for cinematic reasons.<br/><br/>It is beautifully crafted and the performances are straight out of the top drawer. Damien and the train driver are very powerfully played, Sinead is a typical young Irishwoman in the drama and is brilliantly portrayed in muted but vital terms. Ken Loach's direction is magnificent and though I do not share his political ideologies, I commend his insights and his talent. There are huge factual truths behind this film in that it is based around typical events of that period but I do not accept the blatant ""baddienss"" of the English portrayed here. They were more subtle and humane in many cases and much worse in others. They were just an out of control paramilitary force in a so-called democracy.<br/><br/>For people who are not of my age (55) and not from Ireland, this film probes deep into the heart of the simple times (no running water, no electricity, no telephones, very few automobiles etc.). I felt memories of living in rural Ireland in my early youth in these circumstances, and the emotional memories of uncles and aunts and idyllic childhood summers came flooding through and are still with me as I write this piece.<br/><br/>I feel violated in a very good sense of that word by this film, it burrowed in under my skin and probed my mind like no other piece of cinema has ever done before. I could critique lots of little things but the greatest canvas has a few flaws because it was painted by a man. <br/><br/>This movie is simply the best and in its contrast to the standard Hollywood blockbuster it stands out as extraordinary. Cillian Murphy must be an Oscar contender if the US distributes this film. The jury at Cannes was not wrong, and if Denzel Washington was part of the unanimous vote for the Palm D'Or then maybe there is a market in the US for this one. It might be a slow burner instead of a box-office extravaganza. That is this film's tradegy and Hollywood's triumph of mediocrity over genius. Tinsel rubbish can sell if packaged properly, and greatness can languish for years before being recognised (a la Van Gough). Take your Palme D'Or Mr. Loach & Co. you deserve this much recognition and the grateful thanks of a ""middle-class"" Irishman who came from humble beginnings. I hope I have not forgotten."
"ian-697","10","10","27","27 June 2006"," The most important Irish movie ever
","Having read some of the most negative comments here on IMDb about this movie, it is disheartening (to say the least) that individuals of a certain disposition should allow their own political agendas to impinge upon their appreciation of great cinema and great storytelling. There's clearly been a large degree of strategic down-voting here - so for anyone who normally searches IMDb and looks no further than the score, please don't be mislead.<br/><br/>Let's get a few of the common misconceptions out of the way. This isn't about spreading anti-British sentiment. It isn't about glorifying war or violence or murder. It isn't about stirring up old hatreds. It isn't even about flag-waving nationalism.<br/><br/>What we do have here is simply a story of one of the most difficult times in Irish history, the bloodshed and bitter civil war that led to the creation of our modern nation, and how that backdrop relates to the ordinary working people, families, and particularly two brothers. The war as it is represented here, and the morality that drives it, is never heroic or beautiful. It is brutal. Painful. Horrible. It's not an easy ride, it is hard going and at times even tearful. As Ireland was driven to civil war and brother literally fought against brother in the name of freedom from shackles of British oppression, it is yet a remarkable achievement that this story has retained so many shades of grey in its morality, without resorting to sledgehammer symbolism or mawkish sentimentality.<br/><br/>True, it may be reasonable to say that this is a movie primarily made for an Irish audience. However it can definitely be enjoyed by anyone who simply loves great cinematic storytelling. Don't be one of those people who writes off a great story like this, an important movie like this, simply because you heard somewhere that it is anti-British. Don't be one of those people who ignores a great movie because of politics. With some highly notable performances from Orla Fitzgerald, Liam Cunningham, and of course Cillian Murphy, this is too good a movie to pass up based on the opinions of others. If you love great movies, you owe it to yourself to see this regardless of what corner of the earth you call home. Watch it, and make it up your own mind. This is a movie that needed to be made, and having found it devastating, poignant, and difficult to watch at times, I can sincerely report that it needs to be seen.<br/><br/>The only final comment I would add is that the accents haven't been diluted one bit for an international audience. Naturally the Irish audience really appreciates this because I think we've all had enough watered-down fake Oirish accents on the silver screen, but at the same time I can well imagine that others will struggle with them."
"Spaceygirl","7","4","8","9 July 2007"," Beautifully made
","A lovely albeit tragic story told in the best possible way, ""The Wind that shakes the Barley"" is a an excellent historical film. Cillian Murphy excels in his portrayal as a man caught up in events well beyond his control. As anyone with a love of Irish music knows, the title ""The Wind that shakes the Barley"" is a song about a rebel who sacrifices his love for his cause, and that's exactly what Damian (Cillian Murphy) does. At the outset,he's apathetic to the cause wanting more to go to Medical School than to get involved in fighting that he sees as pointless. As events unfold he becomes more involved and indeed, becomes one of the ringleaders and is ultimately doomed by his unstinting support and involvement. Cillian Murphy is one of those actors you can't help but watch, bringing an intensity to the role. The supporting cast matches him admirably and the story pulls you in. The British are unsympathetically shown, which is a pity, seeing as most of the soldiers sent to Ireland were merely boys and were only there to follow orders. Many of them fell in love with Ireland and the Irish and more than one baby were born of British soldiers during the occupation."
"snugglepuffin_pie","10","6","14","24 January 2007"," A emotionally provocative look at a war that tore families apart.
","A film that I found personally moving, as well as balanced in its telling. Unlike the ""anti-Brit"" piece it has been billed as, ""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" is, at times, a brutal representation of a little understood war. This film comes from a stand point that needs to be remembered. All too often the Irish struggle against British rule is painted as only the work of car bombing terrorists. This film shows it to be a cause that runs far deeper than that, a matter of identity. It reminds us that the British were an occupying force in Ireland, and that the initial resistance was no different that any other for independence, no matter what came after. It shows faults on both sides, atrocities committed by the black and tans but also ambushes set up by Republican forces. The centre piece of this film is surely not a dig at the British, but a look at the relationships that any such conflict effects, community members, friends, and especially that between brothers. War films have been made for countless years, and more often than not the British have been shown winning. Why then can't two brothers from Co. Cork been shown trying to achieve right for them. Can it not finally be accepted that there are no winners and losers in war, no right and wrong. There are just those who survive, and those who don't."

So with few knowledge and quite high expectations i sat down and watched this movie.<br/><br/>And i was disappointed, in a way. Although the acting is good (Cillian Murphy) i had a hard time staying focused on the screen. Especially the first hour drags, and it feels like (and is) a lot of the same.It is constantly British soldiers hurting Irish people, Irish people getting revenge on the soldiers etc.<br/><br/>The last thirty minutes of the movie it becomes more interesting, when the two brothers ""choose sides"", and Irish people start killing other Irish people. These minutes are the best of the film with some powerful scenes, but a very unconvincing and anticlimactic last five minutes.<br/><br/>Overall a small disappointment, and don't be afraid you will miss something in your life if you have not seen this movie.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

In 1919-20 the British government repression in Ireland was a dead-set disgrace.<br/><br/>iii) Irish people seem to miss that the same people who were exploiting them in Ireland were also exploiting working people in England and Scotland. My great grandparents in England were not persecuting the Irish, they were too busy being worked to death for the same lousy pay as the Irish were getting.<br/><br/>iv) To English people the events in Ireland in 1920 pale into insignificance compared to (say) the Spanish Armada in 1588. As it said in the movie. to English people Ireland was a 'priest ridden backwater'<br/><br/>v) Ireland is now clearly a prosperous liberal democracy with a seat at the table of the 'rich man's club'. It is good to see the Irish getting on with driving BMWs rather than warring incessantly.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I survived two IRA bomb blasts in London. Gerry Adams never did explain why he tried to kill me. I'm darned if I can understand it either."

","This film is a riveting account of people in the Irish Republican Army, an accurate rendering of history portrayed with excellent acting by everyone in it. It was hard to watch due to the violent, sad images and events, but not a film I could stop watching because of those. The savagery that takes place on both sides was clearly juxtaposed with the tenderness of love, loyalty, joy between family and friends and the stark beauty of the Irish countryside. The determination of the people to be free of British control is, of course, truly epic. The revealing of how far people will go for love of their homeland is presented in all of it's gritty, bloody and heroic colors. I was glue to my set and while horrified by the twisted turn of events in the character's lives, I had to see it through to the end. I will not go into anything about the plot or characters, but I will say this, for anyone who is Irish, like I am, or who has a real interest in the history of England and Ireland, this is a must see film. Beautifully cinematography only add to it richness. Just have a box of Kleenex nearby. It was more than enough to make a grown man cry. It enriched my soul, informed my mind and tore my heart out.

The nation that invented ethnic cleansing and committed numerous act of genocide all over the world, was trying to teach a lesson in justice and peace in the Balkans.

"gergil","10","10","28","7 July 2006"," Powerful!
","Only around 40 prints of this excellent film have been distributed in the UK, while France has distributed over 400! The Irish edition of a certain British national newspaper praised the movie, while the British edition of the same newspaper condemned it, and castigated British director Ken Loach for making it. My personal yardstick for judging the quality of any movie is ""Do I find myself thinking about it long after I've seen it?"" This movie passes that test - with merit - I have hardly stopped thinking about it since! Nobody spoke as we walked out of the cinema. It was as if we were in collective shock, as if we had all survived some traumatic experience. And it HAD been tough going! If a camera had been focused on the audience to record our reactions, it would show people squirming uncomfortably in their seats, wincing, grimacing in horror, and I'm sure, crying! The movie depicts the Irish War of Independence with brutal accuracy. It demonstrates with great clarity why the country divided following the truce with Britain, with each side's arguments being equally persuasive. The movie exposes the tragic horror of civil war, and shows how friends and even family members, once closely united, can become mortal enemies. Tough going, but essential viewing for anyone interested in serious cinema. It proves that a grainy, low-budget movie, containing unknown actors giving strong, believable performances can move an audience more than many CGI-laden Hollywood blockbusters! In my opinion, the movie is a worthy Palme d'Or winner. But don't expect it to sweep the board at the BAFTAs!"

","It is impossible to review this film without making references to Neil Jordan's ""Michael Collins"", so I'll get the comparisons out of the way. This is a far better film. There is none of the romance that became a little hard to stomach in Jordan's film, and thankfully, no Julia Roberts. As an Irish person, I could actually feel the sting of race memory while I watched some of the film's bitterest scenes. You don't have to be Irish though to know what this film is all about and why so many reviewers were uncomfortable with it. It is set in County Cork and the rural environment creates a stark atmosphere, similar to that captured in Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"". In fact, this movie has greater similarities to Gibson's Scottish epic than Neil Jordan's biopic of Michael Collins. Killian Murphy gives a wonderful performance as Damien, a medical student whose principles lead him away from medicine into a world of guerrilla warfare. Watch out for how well Murphy plays being passive.His character is anything but passive. Yet Killian Murphy finds that other level to portray a truly three dimensional role. There are fine performances from Liam Cunningham and Orla Fitzgerald also. There are times when this movie has the quality of a ""fly-on-the-wall"" documentary to it. This effect makes the violence more disturbing and realistic. It isn't all about guns and beatings though. The dialog is scripted in such a way as to make some of the more ambiguous issues in the Irish Civil War and struggle for freedom very clear. I could talk about this film all night. Just go and see it."

","This movie I found to be extremely accurate in being able to portray just how Brutal and savage the British were in Ireland and what drove the Irish to form the IRA. Ireland needed a force that could not only pacify these savages but drive them out. The IRA are shown accurately for what they were, heroic soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice to achieve victory and who had to be effective.<br/><br/>In the end the victory was bittersweet leading to a civil war of brother against brother and the depiction in this movie where comrades who fought through the entire war then turning on each other is quite accurate. I don't think the British could ever understand the Irish, they certainly couldn't pacify the country and their colonies in Ireland were essentially annihilated apart from the North east. While ALL british soldiers in this movie are depicted as evil savages the fact was some just wanted to serve their country, they didn't want to kill Irishmen. I feel sorry for these soldiers getting sent by an imperialist government to fight a war they could never win. Ireland's patriotism was tested for almost a millennium, in the end we came out the victor"
"Red-125","9","1","1","2 September 2019"," Brilliant film about the Irish revolution and civil war
","The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006) was directed by Ken Loach.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy portrays Damien, a young physician who is drawn into the Irish revolution and, later, the civil war. Orla Fitzgerald plays Sinead, a young woman who works with the rebels and is in love with Damien. Damien loves her as well, but nothing can be certain in a war zone.<br/><br/>Director Loach portrays the situation on the ground very well. We believe in the cruelty of the British soldiers and the determination of the rebels. We see scenes of fighting that look all too real. However, Loach assumes that we have a certain amount of knowledge about the earlier rebellion in 1916, the dock strike, and the pros and cons of the treaty with England. Most of us in the U.S. don't have that knowledge.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch the movie, I would suggest picking up some basic information about Irish history from 1916 to 1923. That's what I did, and it was worth the effort.<br/><br/>We saw the film on the small screen. It would work better in a theater, but it worked well enough on DVD. The movie has a strong IMDb rating of 7.5. I think it's even better than that.<br/><br/>P.S.

","I watched this film when it was released in a limited amount of cinemas in the UK after it was made. Much like Kenneth Griffith's documentary about Michael Collins ""released"" or more accurately, suppressed in the 1970's (Hang Out Your Brightest Colours). It equally offended the British requirement to airbrush history and make the forces of the crown appear as defenders of all that is good and honourable. I've loved everything that Ken and his team have made. This year I've been researching my father's military history. He (Jack Donovan) joined the newly formed Free State Army on August 9th 1922 in Cork, just two weeks before Collins was shot at Beal na mBlath. He had served with Fianna Eireann from 1919 until the truce. He would have been about the same age as Chris Reilly in the film. I recall many of his stories of the civil war in west Cork, serving as a volunteer with the likes of ""Teddy O'Donovan"" in the movie. Ken's depiction of greens, reds, opportunists, gombeen men, idealists is as true to life as I could possibly imagine. Great drama. Great history.Thanks Ken. You put the record straight.

The Dail split, 64 for the treaty, 57 against and the army under its authority the IRA split also.<br/><br/>The anti-treaty people did not want an all-Ireland ""Free State"". The words ""Free State"" are the dirtiest words in the Republican lexicon.<br/><br/>The ""Treaty"" held out the prospect of unity, and both pro-Treatyies and anti regarded Partition as a very temporary expedient by the British in 1920, too ludicrous to have any future."

","SPOILERS AHEAD The wind that shakes the barley is magnificent. There is no other word to describe it. It has been unfairly slaughtered by inept critics, who are obviously looking for critical possibilities to misrepresent and scandalise the subject matter. I have been on this forum since the very start, and have read a range of posters who have used various means to criticise, but in my opinion, the Palm D'or has justly been handed to ken Loach for making a beautiful movie.<br/><br/>Before the politics of the movie, let me speak of the acting, directing and feel of the movie. The acting is superb. Cillian Murphy and Padraig Delaney stand out along with Liam Cunningham as the pillars that the movie is built around. they ably convince and excel as portraying the harshness, rawness and anger felt by their characters. Cillians character Damien, is a fine romantic lead, the reluctant hero who grows into the epitome of strength that he never thought he could be. Teddy, plays the leader of the flying column who steps into the shoes of the dismissed British oppressors, aligning himself with the church and big business for what he perceives as the right direction of the New Ireland. Delaney's Dan, is a disciple of James Connolly, a socialist and union man. He believes all will be in vain if a socialist Ireland cannot be achieved. Fine, Fine, heart wrenching performances. Orla Fitzgerald and John Crean and Roger Allam, are convincing in pivotal roles. The dialogue is of the time, the accents impeccable. The script at times slow, but this is to allow for debate in scenes that dictate the politics of the time, and to allow for a balance within the film. The cinematography is spellbinding. The use of the landscape around west cork could be used in tourist film. breathtaking work by barry Ackroyd. The pace of the film is fine, the shootouts are bloody, blunt and unnerving, the violence short and vicious, as you would expect it was, one pivotal torture scene is handled with care to show brutality and resistance, loyalty and revenge, terror and horror all melting into each other tragically. Often Violence leads to greater violence, tit for tat, and tat for tit, leading to people questioning the validity of what they are doing, is it all worth it? all these questions and emotions are charged by loach, and seamlessly role the story along, with soft meanderings into the romance between Damian and Sinead. Excellent job done well by all concerned.<br/><br/>The politics of the film, have been represented as purely a socialist loaches preaching's, This is unfair, its much more complex then that. The film shows the splintered views of the Irish, united against the foreign invader. The colonial actions of the British are represented as violent, oppressive, racist and murderous. It is hard to disagree with this representation, as anyone who has studied history of the time will know. As long as the British are involved, then the united Irishmen will stand together, and die for each other to expel the foreign oppressor. Once the Brits are gone, then it is left to the main protagonists to help put it together, the great debate of the Treaty. There is always the sense of the strings being pulled from the outside, notes and telegrams from Dublin prompt the execution of friends, and tragically family. Once the British have been removed, the stories relevance shines. It shows the many faces of irishness. The simple farmhands and poor, who are still recovering from the Famine, and have nothing. They are easily led and cajoled into actions that lead to their doom. They are the true victims of the film. Some hold guns, obviously with no idea of what is happening. The poor Chris is one of the most tragic fellows of the film. The socialist Dan and his following of Connolly, quoting snippets of articles, constitution and speeches, seeing only a socialist Ireland as being the true successor to British rule. Damian, aligns himself with Dan, but he is more of a centralist who understand the role of business and church, but sees the freeing of Ireland as a way of throwing the shackles off the poor. When he sees the possibility of big business stepping into the role of the British occupier, he is both sickened and driven to fight on for justice and a land of equal opportunity, it iswhat he sees as the natural successor to British Rule. Teddy embraces the Treaty and sees it as the independence and the chance to copper fasten the Free State, and act as a stepping stone to a future united Ireland. The Normal man, who always makes up the majority, is happy enough to get the British out, and while cant stand the idea of the Treaty; it is harder for them to kill their own men, and as such walk out on both sides, happy to melt back into the communities and resume a level of normality. The Big business, who supply the powerful, but extract from the poor. The church that align to the powerful, but lecture and embrace the poor. All aspects of the New Ireland are represented. It is not an easy of clear solution that is coming or is portrayed, it is a freedom with a cost. The freedom that will drive brother to kill brother. Yeats coined the phrase, A Terrible Beauty, this film is a fleshing out of that phrase, it gives life to these immortal words, and as such, I can pay this film no greater tribute."

","First of all the film is a work of fiction so any criticism regarding specific incidents and details is somewhat missing the point. Having said that the movie catches well the tone of the times, as reflected in personal accounts and scholarly work dealing with that period. The film is shot chronologically so, the first period dealing with the war of independence is particularly striking visually as the change from autumn 1920 to spring 1921 is reflected in the changing light in the landscape.<br/><br/>Loach spends some time dealing with people's political arguments. While some criticize this as boring they are missing the point. People involved in politics talk about politics. To make a film about a revolution with only battle scenes would be as much a distortion of truth as to make a war film without death.<br/><br/>The core of the film however is about the dehumanizing effect that war has on decent human beings.

","This is Ken Loach on top form, reading a complex and subtle history lesson that implies, without ever stating it, a terribly simple message for our own times: that military occupation of an alien nation always ends in violence and brutality: that the act of occupation brutalises not only the occupiers but also, even more tragically, the occupied: that the experience of resistance to alien occupation teaches a habit of violence that may be impossible to shake off even when the occupation ends: and that alien occupation may be disastrously divisive for the occupied, especially if they are already prone to internal division by reason of their religion, tribes, sects, social classes, economic inequalities, or otherwise. Only the deliberately blind can affect to miss the way that all these messages, each one carefully illustrated by Loach as it applied (in some ways still applies) to the Ireland of 1920, are horrendously relevant to Iraq in 2006.<br/><br/>Yet Loach never completely lacks compassion for even the most brutal of his oppressors to the extent of painting them in simple black and white. He goes out of his way to show that the Black and Tans are individuals who have gone through the horrors and slaughter of the first world war, ended only two years previously, and have inevitably been brutalised by it; and an act of merciful courage by one British soldier who risks his life to save a group of Irish Republicans from imminent execution shows that even these men have consciences and can be brave in a good as well as a bad cause. <br/><br/>Nor is the Irish resistance depicted as uniformly heroic or saintly: the terrible moral dilemmas that constantly face them are shown to have no perfectly acceptable resolution, leading essentially decent men to commit acts of dreadful cruelty, not only against their oppressors but eventually against each other. Anyone who can't recognise Iraq in all this can't have watched The Wind that Shakes the Barley with much attention.<br/><br/>There are brilliant and sensitive performances by Cillian Murphy and Padraic Delaney as the two brothers; and every other part is played with sometimes gut-wrenching realism. There are scenes of violence and cruelty that are sometimes hard to watch, but they are always essential to the narrative and to the film's basic themes, never gratuitous. The photography is equally outstanding: look out for Loach's and Barry Ackroyd's subtle and effective use of colour and their constant reminders that the conflicts described in the film are linked as if by umbilical cord to the land of Ireland, beautifully represented in contrast to the ugly violence that repeatedly defiles it. The political debates, the participants painfully seeking to find a way through the moral thickets of oppression and division, are seamlessly absorbed into the action, as gripping in their way as the agonising effects of violence on human relationships and the intermittent outbreaks of violence and cruelty themselves.<br/><br/>The squeals of 'anti-British!' from some of the more repulsive British tabloid newspapers can safely be ignored. This is great cinema. It deserved its Palme d'Or at Cannes. Don't, on any account, miss it.<br/><br/>Brian"
"dubs_rl","9","9","26","2 July 2006"," Apologists and little Britons should watch this!
","Speaking as a born-and-bred Londoner from several generations of Londoners, this is a very important film for several reasons. It's a film that angers me but not for the reasons others may think. I'm angered because, until I decided to find out myself, I had little idea of my country's bloody past with our neighbour across the Irish Sea. I didn't know that an undeclared war had raged between 1916 and 1922 as a small nation sought to take on the British empire.<br/><br/>Why didn't I know? Why wasn't I taught that at school? British kids know more about the build-up to the Second World War (and so they should too) than they do about over seven hundred years of Anglo-Irish history. Why is that? Why is it that most British people have never been to Ireland, they can't tell one Irish regional accent from another and don't know where the border is? Do subsequent UK governments not think that it's important that we know? Obviously not, because if kids did know, they might want to do something about it. Do Britain have a guilt complex when it comes to their past in Ireland? British kids now know more about Los Angeles or New York than they do about the UK's bloody past. <br/><br/>Loach is no friend of the British establishment. His earlier film, Hidden Agenda (about the armed struggle in Northern Ireland in the early eighties) was also a cause celebre here for quite a while with the usual little Englanders calling for it to be banned etc. <br/><br/>What did you expect? Good old lilleywhite John Bull?! <br/><br/>It's not a pleasant film but then it wasn't a pleasant time. War rarely is. I doubt anyone who believes in a rosy we-were-only-a-benign-landlord ideology will go to see this film but they should. It's easy to shy away from unpleasant truths from the past. There's some pretty grim scenes in this, including of the fingernail-pulling footage. Historically it's pretty accurate and the period detail is good.<br/><br/>Something made me smile: the treaty was signed just before Christmas 1921 and those watching the newsreel of it should've been wearing winter coats! From the treaty being ratified in late 1921, it took Ireland another twenty-eight years to achieve total independence and to move from being a dominion to a republic. This film shows the first solid steps to achieving what Collins called ""the freedom to achieve freedom"".<br/><br/>Buy a ticket, hire it or buy the DVD when it's released but go and see this, especially if you're a Brit. You might learn something."

","The most moving film I've ever seen. When Teddy stood in the courtyard and gave the order for the firing squad to execute his brother, tied to the post, it was astounding film. When the dead Damien lay slumped against the post after his execution you could see why the film deserved the Palme D'or in every respect. You lose something by not seeing this.<br/><br/>Loach's treatment of the left-right divide within the republican camp was very similar to his treatment of the socialist-communist divide in his Land and Freedom (1996). The soundtrack, too, was very apt with Mac Piarais's Óró, Sé Do Bheatha Abhaile being wonderfully utilised throughout."

","""Burn down the London Theatre, burn down the big Empire."" - Roaring Lion (""Baboolala"") <br/><br/>Set in Ireland, England's oldest colony, Ken Loach's ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" takes place during the decade following World War 1. One of Loach's more mainstream pictures, it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.<br/><br/>""Barley"" opens in 1920, during a spirited hockey match. Two Irish teams are playing, both of whom are then ""assaulted"" by the Blacks and Tans, the British paramilitary group tasked with ""maintaining law and order"" within Ireland. This single incident sets up the trajectory of the entire film, which pits vying Irish factions against one another whilst a British enemy looks on.<br/><br/>Loach then briskly sketches several big historical movements; Irish rebels are seen fighting for freedom from British rule. They succeed only in establishing the Irish Free State, a body which still falls under the dominion of the British Sovereignty. Dissatisfied with the conditions forced upon their ""free state"", various Irish factions swiftly pop up. Some demand ratifications to the new English/Irish credos, whilst others opt not to prod the Empire, fearful of retaliation, rocking the boat or disrupting the status quo. These Irish factions spend much of the early and late 1920s fighting amongst themselves. Loach's film focuses on both these squabbles and the birth of the Irish Republican Army. His overall point, though, is that an independent, supposedly autonomous Ireland, is nothing without socialism. Independence leads but to increased nationalist ideology, and merely propagates capitalism's social relations. For Loach, an independent capitalist Ireland is not an independent Ireland at all, but one still held in bondage.<br/><br/>The film revolves around two brothers, Teddy and Damien O'Donovan. Damien's you're typical Loachian working-class hero. Played by Cillian Murphy, he will not settle for the new treaties, wants some semblance of socialism, and refuses to have English bosses merely replaced by Irish bosses. Teddy, in contrast, is happy to settle for less. Damien abandons his brother and joins an Irish rebel faction which is then hunted by both the English and the new, quasi ""democratic"" Ireland. Whilst Damien spends most of the film as your classic Loachian freedom fighter, he does not start out this way. It is his brother who is initially the radical. Damien, in contrast, is an intellectual type who only slowly comes to the conclusion that risking one's life for half measures is to risk one's life for nothing at all. He wants socialism or nothing, the mantra of many Marxists in the 1960s.<br/><br/>Upon release, ""Barley"" was destroyed by the right-wing, British press. Critics, who spend most of their time praising reactionary films, mauled it on political grounds. The film was likened to Nazi propaganda, the Times of London associated it with both Leni Riefenstahl and Hitler and various newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch called it ""pro IRA"", ""fascist"" and ""poisonous"", before admitting that they ""didn't see the film because one doesn't need to read Mein Kampf"". The question is not whether or not ""Barley"" is fascist or not – it isn't – but why most widely praised art, and indeed most human beings, are not recognised as being either overtly or unconsciously fascist.<br/><br/>""Barley"" is often criticised for its portrayal of British forces as one dimensional brutalizers. It's a blunt, cartoonish portrayal, though the general caricature is somewhat correct. At the time, this thuggery extended all the way up to Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister. Using threats, bribes and lies he forced several treaty's upon Ireland, and promised ""immediate and terrible war"" if the Irish didn't accept. As is often the case when Empire's propose to ""benevolently grant independence"", the overall plan was to partition, destabilise, split nationalist forces and then wait for civil war.<br/><br/>Upon release, Loach explicitly linked his film's tale of radicalism, occupation and warfare to the contemporary situation in Iraq. Bizarrely, Ireland, despite some public outcry, was fervently in support of the Iraq invasions; Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern would designate runways, troops and resources for these wars. Since the bogus Yugoslavian ""interventions"", Ireland has itself become increasingly less ""neutral"" and increasingly more a puppet of the EU, US and UK. Why has the country so quickly forgotten its own past? Capitalism has always ignored the injustices at its peripheries. Indeed, the bounties engendered by its peripheries are often precisely what support and placate the Empire's core. Or, to paraphrase Jacques Ranciere, ""Londoners didn't care about slavery because the colonies were made invisible and routinely shipped home sweet bacon"". The question is, when capitalism colonises everywhere, where does the periphery go?<br/><br/>Despite being leftist agitprop, Loach's overall narrative arc is conventional. Hollywood loves films in which ""little guys"" and ""rebels"" go up against ""big guys"" and ""Empires"", though usually it finds ways to fudge things such that the ""big guy"" - in the historical sense - is perceived as an underdog. Still, compared to pro-treaty Irish films like ""Michael Collins"", Loach is right to oppose the limiting of Ireland's nationalist movements to the creation of a capitalist state. He is also right to turn the film into a dispute between classes and not nations. Unfortunately ""Barley"" also possesses all of Loach's usual flaws. He can't quite capture the relationships between political and social tendencies in all their richness and complexities (neorealism is too limiting), and his reduction of class dynamics to ""workers"" and ""landlords"" is somewhat meaningless in a world in which tax money is symbiotically funnelled into the share portfolios of the very tax dodging companies which both bankrupt nations and provide amazing returns to the same. Questions of ownership are today far more complex, and society as a whole far more amorphous.<br/><br/>8/10 - For better ""mainstream Loach"", see ""Bread and Roses"". Worth two viewings."
"ivyleaves-664-680808","8","3","6","17 February 2010"," Domination and Patriarchy
","I very nearly did not finish watching this movie as it is very hard for me to stomach bullies, lynch mobs, rapists, torturers, and other thugs, especially when so realistically portrayed. I was glad I stuck with this film, however. The most moving part for me was when the scene of harassment at a farmhouse, including lining people up against walls, from the beginning of the movie is repeated nearly identically near the end - only the perpetrators the first time are the British forces, now it is the Free State Irish forces.<br/><br/>The lesson of the movie is simple, don't let your ""ideals"" - religious, political, or whatever lead you down the road of doing violence in order to dominate other people - your neighbors, your friends, your family. It is so easy for us to just accept that something political or religious, like a country, is worth dying for, and somehow that makes it worth killing for. I say it is not.<br/><br/>It makes perfect sense that the Irish State that replaced the British State is doing well financially. As illustrated in the movie, financial interests drive wars. The British and the supporters of the IRA both had commercial interests in the war. Economics fueled the American revolution, the Irish revolution, the French revolution, etc. The ideals sold to the actual fighters, often by the church, are not the point, and never seem to win out in the end. See the ""improvements"" to the status of women in Iraq and Afghanistan that are among the first things to be discarded in negotiations for ""peace."" The ideals keep the cannon fodder going, and are useful negotiation chips, but they are not the reasons for war.<br/><br/>The real battle is to avoid the brainwashing and just love your neighbor."
"paul2001sw-1","9","3","6","22 November 2008"," This could be Bosnia, or anywhere
","Films about the Irish war of independence, and subsequent civil war, are not exactly rare, and there's a scene in 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' in which a group of irregular troops ambush an armoured car which made me want to groan, because it seems a perfect clone of an identical scene in every other movie with the same subject matter. Yet this does not mean that Ken Loach's film is entirely superfluous. Many films show how war dehumanises man, but what Loach catches brilliantly is how war can lead to people doing inhuman things while retaining a measure of their humanity, thus explaining how a peaceful community can slide into internal conflict of the most appalling kind. As such, this could almost have been a film about Bosnia, or any other place where savagery has erupted with unexpected force. As for the specific Irish politics, Loach keeps things fairly even handed, he genuinely wants you to understand how people could take both sides, although the ending stops short of explaining how de Valera's quasi-fascist theocracy emerged out of socialist rebellion. To me, this is Loach's best film for many years, because even though it explores a familiar subject, he manages to place the viewer in a less comfortable position than many of his recent works; it's never easy for us to see where our sympathies should lie. Yet it's all done with his well-established gift of empathy for ordinary people with difficult lives."
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","3","6","7 November 2006"," Will peace ever overcome in Ireland?
","To speak today of the Ireland of the 1920s is always a very difficult matter because it contains a compromise that divided the victors even before it was implemented, a divide along the line that opposed the nationalists who wanted to fight to the finish and the politicians who wanted to make do with what they had gotten and trust the future for the rest. Both were right and both were wrong and the film shows this impossible dilemma through two brothers, through a small community in a small village. Poignant because brothers and sisters are on both sides and they have to fight against their own blood. Yet the film is a lot deeper and stronger than that. We all knew wars were not only inhuman but anti-human. But the film has just been made and it is a reflection on what is happening in Northern Ireland today. The compromise was wrong because it cut Ireland in two and a new war was to come out of this situation and the solution to this new war is a lot more difficult to find. And this time the divide crosses protestant families as well as catholic ones. And peace is inescapable, hence a compromise is historically unavoidable and any compromise will be both temporary and unstable, but also a stone on which to climb up a little bit higher later on. The compromise was right too just for that reason: it enabled the Irish to get in business in Ireland and to sort out and rule their own concerns, which eventually made them both a lot stronger and entirely independent. On one side the nationalists believed that history had to be made by human action and they were afraid of any regression later on. On the other side the reformists believed that history was going at its own speed and that it could not be forced. On one side those who were deeply influenced by leninism. On the other side those who were for a liberal, capitalistic world. On one hand the working class. On the other the business people. And that's where Ken Loach becomes brilliant. He does not push us in any direction. He shows the human or man-made mostly horrific side of things and he let us draw our own lines and conclusions, knowing that history cannot be rewritten and that the future is what history will make it, not us, not our necessary decisions, not our indispensable actions. Decisions and actions will have to go the way history is going. And who knows for sure where it is going?

It doesn't show the English in a great light, but then, from the view of the characters, that is what happened... In my opinion it didn't really glorify the IRA. The film highlighted their reasons somewhat, but it showed how it was a pretty ugly & unforgiving force as well...<br/><br/>I feel the film tried to cram a lot into a short enough period of time. From the point of the Treaty on seemed somewhat rushed, and a bit sporadic compared to the earlier part of the film.<br/><br/>But once again, Loachs film has a superb natural script. Most of the acting was top notch, and there were a good few moments of comic relief within this very serious film.

"cliveowensucks","3","7","22","11 November 2006"," Anti-Irish propaganda posing as pro-Republicanism
","The press office for THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY have done a great job of convincing a gullible media and public that it's anti-English propaganda from a self-hating Englishman, which is an excellent way of luring the Celts to cinemas under false pretences. The truth is it's the most vitriolically anti-Irish film ever made. Had Ian Paisley written the script it couldn't have been more anti-Eirean. And people are sucking it up, especially IMDBers who haven't bothered to see it before flying the green.<br/><br/>First off, this is NOT a film about British policy. It's about what Ken Loach sees as the Irish people's cowardly betrayal of the revolution in the Irish Civil War. Loach's thesis is as simple as it is moronic. The only reason the majority voted for the treaty that divide Ireland was because he thinks they were too stupid and cowardly to see the benefits of socialism. So the only humane solution is to kill everyone who reached a democratic decision because Loach thinks the Irish people were and are simply too stupid to be trusted with the fate of THEIR own country or THEIR own destiny. Better dead than not red, eh, Ken? Oh yes, and the only reason the Free Staters won was because they were pro-British. Believe it or not, Loach even throws in a scene of pro-Treaty forces beating up poor Irish tenants on behalf of absentee English landlords! Subtle it ain't, but Ken doesn't do subtle. His message is clear – the will of the Irish people of the time was completely irrelevant and everyone, everyone at all who believes in democracy must be killed to usher in the socialist utopia that this English director demands Ireland accept against its will.<br/><br/>In the process, he completely disproves his supposed criticism of the invasion of Iraq running through the film – after all, if Loach believes that Socialism should be forced on the Irish people at gunpoint, how can he logically disagree with a nominally socialist British government invading Iraq and forcing then to accept a political system at gunpoint? The only difference is the system: it's okay in his eyes to kill Irish people to impose socialism, but not to kill Iraqis in the name of imposing democracy. Yet both are exactly the same – a patronising outsider justifying the deaths of innocent people to remould a nation in their ideal image.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Englishman Loach thinks the majority of the Irish people were ignorant children who didn't deserve to live and that Eire should never have been given independence. Very anti-British sentiments I don't think. That kind of simplistic racist anti-Irish propaganda floods the while film-making process. We get cardboard cut-out characters shouting political sound bites at each other and even, kid you not, the ""God light"" beams of glowing saintly lighting he throws on the anti-Treaty forces and the ugly photography he gives the pro-Treaty forces of the evil English imperialist Michael Collins (yeah, his grasp of Irish history IS that totally mixed up).<br/><br/>And what an awful script! Whenever anyone puts the pro-Treaty view, Loach makes sure they are a lone voice easily ridiculed and driven away by a crowd of patriots even though history tells us the majority were pro-Treaty. This is Loach's idea of being even-handed, I guess, by distorting the popular view as a minority. And what arguments. What dialogue. They can be summed up like this – ""I think the Treaty and the Irish Free State is a good start.<br/><br/>""That's because you're a coward."" ""No, it is because I am evil. You can tell because I think Socialism is silly. You had better kill me out of kindness before I invade Iraq."" ""Right-oh then, bruv."" Yes, I'm exaggerating. Paul Laverty's script is not that subtle in its contempt and bile for the Irish people. It's made worse by the pathetic performances. Even the usually excellent Cillian Murphy is no better than a six year old in a nativity play in this one. Trite and insulting racist garbage that only an old school Stalinist communist hard liner could buy into. Plus a bad movie on top of everything else. How this rubbish got the top award at Cannes is anybody's guess. Maybe they thought if they gave him an award after all these years he'd finally go away and stop bothering them.<br/><br/>More fantasy than history, this is just laughable."

","This film evokes the savagery of both the brutal British occupation of Ireland and the internecine violence and treachery of the civil war that followed independence. While it is not a nuanced portrayal of Irish life at the time, it clearly conveys the dehumanizing affects of violence and how in any conflict it is always the innocent who suffer most. The early decades of the twentieth century were a turbulent and violent time for Ireland. Nationalists were forcibly repressed by British soldiers who carried out many atrocities. These actions eventually sparked the War of Independence, which culminated in the controversial treaty of 1922. The film focuses on the lives of a group of rebels from the beginning of the War of Independence to the bloody events of the Civil War. Beautifully shot in rural Ireland, The Wind that Shakes the Barley features some fine performances. A must see!"

","This is one of the most powerful films I have seen for many years. There has been a lot of tosh written and spoken about it being anti-English (or British) but in fact it is anti-war. Beautifully crafted, one is drawn into the fierce Irish independence struggle against the occupying British, who are removed, but the Irish are still expected to be part of the Empire. It all goes downhill from there, as the pro- and anti-Treaty factions split and the whole horror is re-run, but this time as internecine strife and all the tearing and shredding of loyalties civil war causes. Loach has managed to encapsulate all of this into an absolutely brilliant film. It is no wonder it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. The only surprise to me is that there are not long queues at the box-office."

Best illustrated by the court scene, which was supposed to have viewer sympathy on the poor woman's side but in practice was just a bit primitive altogether.<br/><br/>Everything is absolute in the film: all British are bad (except for single ""good"" ones), all rich are just ripping off the poor, all anti-Treaty forces are principled people, while pro-Treaty are motivated by opportunism. I'm neither Irish nor British and English is my second language, so I couldn't care less about either side, but I just know (from experience in other conflict zones) that life is usually more complex than that.<br/><br/>On top of that, the dialogue is at times very unrealistic; whenever there is a bit of tension everybody just yells their heads off, especially the British. Sometimes the lines are downright primitive, trying to over-emphasize the political points in case someone missed them.<br/><br/>The plot itself can be summed up in four lines, and would take much less then 2-hour movie to convey.<br/><br/>Overall, seems like an attempt to capitalize on (exploit?) a topic that I guess is controversial for some audiences. To an outside observer this looked like a lot of anxiety and emotion (on the part of film's creators) with very little substance."

Probably of an interest to you if you're Irish, and lived in 1920's Ireland. As I have very little knowledge of Ireland during this time, being English and 19, meant I struggled to follow the story of it. It was rather depressing, added to with the constant stream of quiet piano music. It just seemed like a bunch of angry Irish people shooting each other and beating each other up. Yes, yes, this is what it was probably like at the time, but that doesn't mean I should want to watch it. I can see why it did get a thumbs up from many critics, and they are probably more mature than me, and will delve deeper in to this film. I, however, didn't want to waste 2 hours of my life doing so. Yes, the acting was reasonable, there were times when I felt sorry for the characters. On the other hand, I don't think I cared enough and this is why I couldn't watch it. I like being able to associate with the characters on screen, feel their pain, feel their sadness. That's just what this film was missing: the ability to make you feel.

The relationship that was forced in the film seemed to be a metaphor for the conflict of viewpoints during the civil war that ensued. Just not well written nor directed even though Ken Loach is credited it with the direction.

Everything about this movie is beautiful, devastating and yet wonderful. Through this award season I have been shaking my head, wondering why the film that won the Palme D'Or at Cannes isn't part of the mix.

"phatass","10","4","11","21 October 2006"," Insightfull and raw...
","Ken Loach reaches a peak with this recent hit. Showing the raw and gritty reality that surrounded Ireland through the 20's. A realistic and brutal tale of an Irish towns struggle against the British, depicting how they start to rebel and fight back against their oppressors and eventually form an 'army' of there own to take on the British head to head and try to take back the land that is rightfully theirs. A very interesting underlying story about humanity and how even the 'good guys' eventually turn on one another and split into two groups with colliding agendas (resembling 'the Lord of the Flies'). Loach is really showing his talents here.<br/><br/>All in all a fantastic new film whether the subject interests you or not."
"peoniblaur","7","4","11","14 August 2006"," Good film, bad politics
","It's a good film in the Left-wing realist tradition with a nod to Costa-Gavras (and even Brecht). The politics are simplistic, didactic republican socialist. (Someone should explain to Mr. Loach that socialism is the opposite of capitalism--it works in theory but not in practice.) The film should beef up Sinn Fein's vote in the next Irish election, which is about the worst thing that can be said about it. I don't think any Irish director would have made such a black-and-white film: it takes an outsider to have such a stereotyped vision.<br/><br/>As far as I recall you never saw any sky--the camera was always pointing at the ground. Given the director's politics, I doubt if this was an attempt to show how inward-looking and insular Irish republican politics actually are. One can concede that the explicit Fianna Failism of the film counteracts the tendentious Fine Gaelism of Neal Jordan's *Michael Collins.* But whatever ideals Fianna Fail once had have largely disappeared with power and establishment--which will no doubt also be the case with Sinn Fein, if it ever displaces them as the dominant nationalist party. The truest line in the film is probably the one where the British landlord describes Ireland as a priest-ridden backwater, which indeed it was to remain for many years. <br/><br/>I'm no friend of British imperialism (my grandfather fought against them in Dublin in 1916) but I can see how the Brits might have been a bit peeved at a perceived stab in the back, and them stuck in the mud in Flanders fighting for the freedom of small nations, or something like that.<br/><br/>Also the leading actor doesn't have an Irish facial expression and consequently doesn't look Irish. The accents are very good, although maybe a few sub-titles might have been in order.<br/><br/>Good film, bad politics."

","I saw this alone in a movie theater in London, not sure what to expect-- only knowing that it was a truly British movie, an award-winner, and that I was unlikely to have another chance to see it without a great deal of effort. It was one of the best things I did during my month in London, even ranking above some of the plays I went to see. It is an extremely powerful, intense movie and is beautifully and passionately acted. As it ended, the theater staff immediately flicked the lights on and came in to clean up, and the girls next to me, their eyes wide and their mouths open, shook their heads, sniffed, and wiped the mascara from under their eyes, muttering ""no respect."" I walked home in a dream.<br/><br/>I (obviously) highly recommend this movie, even for someone who prefers light or comedic movies that don't require thought. It ranks right up there with Braveheart and Hotel Rwanda, I think, and needs to be seen for the history it presents to an audience that really should be aware."

Having taught Irish history and coming from a background where my father LIVED those moments in nearby Kerry, I can say that the portrayal of the Black and Tans and Auxiliaries is accurate and the pain (on both sides) of the civil war is real. One movie cannot depict in detail the brutal reality of this period but this one certainly comes the closest I've ever seen. The cinematography is brilliant and adds as much to the story as the sparse dialogue.

"movedout","8","2","4","9 October 2006"," ""...undeniable parallels to contemporary deliberations about the conflict in the Middle East..""
","""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" is Ken Loach's latest ode to those that had to betray their better angels for something they more or less believed in. Staunchly socialist and drawing criticisms for his success in Cannes, Loach thankfully refuses to pander to both sides. He sticks to his figurative guns by unapologetically crafting a one-sided view on a subject that he feels confident in, much like ""Land and Freedom"". It does not support so much as condemn and shows how the violent trajectory of the IRA's policies and actions throughout the years came to be. In the end, it is not so much the political polemic as many as claim or hope it is, but a pointed political examination of the dread that war drums up amidst the quixotic ideals of patriotism and martyrdom.<br/><br/>An occupation starts to take shape in 1920s, Ireland when the British send in their military squads known as the Black and Tans. The film is keen to point out that these soldiers are remnants of the cruelty that World War I had left in its wake. The much-reviled British soldiers are caricatured as brutes, but in truth, they give off a sense of desperate senselessness by reluctantly laying their humanity on the line for a cause not all of them believe in. And that can very well be said for the Republicans as well. There are no winners. There are no saviours. There are only choices to be made. The lines that are crossed define these characters.<br/><br/>The full-blooded cinematography is in stark contrast to the gray, bleak world that is being depicted. A quick check shows the unsurprising inclusion of frequent Loach collaborator, Barry Ackroyd, responsible for its masterful cinematography. Its pastoral simplicity is engulfed in a complex battle of principles as blood is shed indiscriminately upon its meadows. Hillside ambushes amidst the foliage lead to stained verdure and the deathly calm aftermath as the survivors tally the casualties. It starts to eat away at the vigilance of these men as it hauntingly signifies what's to come.<br/><br/>Soon the subterfuge, clandestine assassinations and abuse their womenfolk receive by protecting them start to take their toll on these men. As soon as a truce is called, many of them rejoice even though they know that they are still not truly sovereign. But at least the violence ceases and the impunity lifted over the despicable abuses of power. The Anglo-Irish Peace Treaty is signed, forming the Irish Free State that remains under the dominion of the British Empire, and strictly loyal to the monarchy. Teddy, jaded from fighting the good fight, chooses the respite from the constant struggle. To complicate matters further, Damien is adamant that a truly independent state will only come if they shake off the British shackles. They are pitted against each other's perfidy as tragic and powerful metaphors fuel the backdrop of their waning ambitions, slowly finding themselves fighting against something and forgetting what they were initially fighting for.<br/><br/>It rescinds on Michael Collins's historical role in establishing the Irish Free State, Loach takes the unorthodox approach in dismantling the self-serving romanticised paradox of freedom fighting from within. The terms, oppressors and victims are routinely switched around. Casual as that sounds, it truly signifies the futility of violence for the sake of ideology. They constantly feud while on the same side as the gasconading bravado of its masculine characters threaten to implode their united and spirited response towards their occupiers. It does begin by not fully romanticising the idea of rebellion and justice being served swiftly and without recrimination. But the temptation to do so never full dissipates as a burgeoning romance grows between Damien and Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald), a fiery character opposed to the aggression that ensues on both sides. Loach lingers on the violence and the cost of uprising against a battle that is there to be lost. The shots are measured from a distance, mourning the circumstances. Gracefully mixing up a downbeat sense of loss with a blend of impassioned rhetoric and cinematic brutality, it accomplishes an appropriately funereal atmosphere in each of its scenes.<br/><br/>Time passes arbitrarily, while observing the ad hoc building of plans and situations, which is viewed with underwhelming anticipation. There is something so disconnecting in its quick scene after powerful scene. While the dialogue is seemingly crisp and natural between the Republicans, it is also unusually fast and highly derivative, commanding all attention. The dependence of the dialogue and inherently dragging pace threatens to overpower the raw intensity of the actions. The latter half does tend to veer towards melodrama, and over-wrought scenes of verbose, passionate speeches strangely switches allegiances of the fighters at the drop of a dime. It is most convincing, not by its words but by its actions as clearly seen in its opening minutes. That single event polarises young Damien into the politicised man we follow throughout the film.<br/><br/>Recreated with such insight and groundwork, his commitment shines through at every level. As with all his films, the ardent and sincere look at politics through his characters distinguishes them as people caught in a whirlpool of despair. They show lament, fear and even some apathy to the choices they have before them.<br/><br/>It draws undeniable parallels to contemporary deliberations about the conflict in the Middle East and insurgency against the US and Britain. There is a distinct disgust at the idea of militarism and clerical influence in the state. The urban guerilla freedom fighters are just ordinary folk caught in a landslide of activism, straddling the thin line overflowing with brutality and the excruciating agony of guilt while not becoming intoxicated by the violence. Entrenched with the ""an eye for an eye"" dogma, it signifies the mutually ruinous end of all. By accentuating the power of choices, it prods us to witness the inner struggle of finding a footing in the slippery slopes of warfare."
"PeterJordan","8","2","4","8 August 2006"," Loach casts an excellent social focus on Ireland's troubled history
","This film has provoked considerable debate here in Ireland in addition to the somewhat unfair and misguided controversy elsewhere especially within the UK media.<br/><br/>To me probably the biggest tragedy of this particularly harrowing period of Irish history was not especially the atrocities carried out by the Black and Tan British Mercenaries on Irish civilians and replicated back in kind by IRA flying squads, but rather the fact that when all this was over, then the two opposing factions of Irish, pro and anti treaty turned on each other with a ruthless matching and even surpassing that which they had targeted the British with previously.<br/><br/>This has been hailed in some quarters in Ireland as an accompanying balancing piece of cinema to Neil Jordan Michael Collins. In truth, whereas Michael Collins sought to package the story in a nicely accessible and embraceable to all summary, complete with a romantic interest in the form of Julia Roberts, TWTSTB pursues a much more gritty trademark Loach realism on a wider theme of social issues and morals. It is this feature of the film that helps it rise above the mere story of a period of Irish history and offer an insightful social commentary for our times for those that care to look for it and don't allow themselves to be blinkered by questions of history.<br/><br/>There are parallels to be drawn from this movie to the current situation in Iraq and all the other Imperial incursions in war zones of the 21st century. There are legacies hinted upon in this movie which persist to this day in Ireland: when one of the characters foretells what the treaty will mean for the Catholics of the 6 counties of Northern Ireland or that the proposed boundary commission encompassed within the treaty is merely a ruse and that it will never be fully explored further. Or more pressingly in the light of the current impasse between Big Energy Corporations and residents of the West Coast over Gas, where one of the characters proclaims that freedom for Ireland should mean much more than mere freedom of the people but ownership of the land and all its resources by the people and for the people.<br/><br/>There are parts of this movie that are truly harrowing and the movie as a whole could certainly not be described as particularly uplifting or happy in any way yet within it there are some moment of intensely observed beauty. At varying points the movie brings into focus the personal dilemmas of a doctor turned IRA gunman and a British Army officer surrounded by men driven mad and out of control by their experiences from the slaughter on the Somme battlefields, both perceptive enough to realise the line that they have crossed.<br/><br/>True there are unpleasant scenes involving British Auxiliaries (The dreaded Black and Tans) out of control and truly obnoxious towards the Irish but the accuracy of these scenes can be confirmed by thousands of eyewitness accounts of the time and by the legacy or towns burned by the Black and Tans in reprisals. Equally similarly brutality is shown and portrayed by the IRA flying columns in their summary executions and ambushes, albeit even if most of their intending victims are portrayed in a less than favourable light prior to their demise, as if to somehow make them more worthy of their fate.<br/><br/>There is also a brilliant portrayal of the chinks already appearing in the Irish side even while they fight the Brits, where two very different ideologies are developing who will ultimately turn on each other with neither really emerging victorious or unscathed but both of which will dictate the pace and economic deprivation to come for Ireland from which she will only eventually emerge in the 1990's when the so called Civil War politics are finally laid to rest.<br/><br/>As an insight into this period of Irish History and an accompanying piece to Neil Jordan's ""Michael Collins"" this is a wonderful piece of film making. But it is also a wider social commentary on the dangers and price of Colonialism and Imperialism at any cost which those nations trying to impose their will and norms on another to this day could do to take note of."

","I have already written a review but want to possibly clear up a ""technicality"" mentioned by another reviewer. It was stated that Damien said he was leaving for work in a hospital at week's end. The reviewer felt that a farmer would work 7 days a week and not consider a week's end. It is my feeling that the main characters are Catholic and they most certainly would acknowledge a week's end with Mass on Sunday. Just my thoughts on one small part of the movie. Three movies stand out in my mind as making this Irish-American aware of exactly what went on in Ireland. The first is a documentary about the assassination of Michael Collins ans was called ""The Shadow of Beal na Blath"". The second movie was this one - ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"". The third is Liam Neeson's ""Michael Collins"". There is no unknowing for me. The struggle has not ended, sadly. Not so long as Britain remains in control of any part of Ireland - a stolen country. Damien is asked his name, after he has joined the fight. His reply still rings in my heart: ""I am a member of the Irish Republican Army. I demand to be treated as a political prisoner...I'm a Democrat. In the last election, Sinn Fein won 73 seats out of a possible 105. Our mandate's for an Irish Republic completely separate from Great Britain... Your government, which suppresses our parliament, which suppresses our paper, your presence here is a crime, a foreign occupation. You tell me what I'm supposed to do, as a Democrat? Turn the cheek for another 700 years? Get out of my country. Get out of my country."" Powerful

The ""family feud"" isn't really a family feud at all but a debate between these two currents. We can see the today the result of this battle.<br/><br/>The scenery is beautiful, the costumes, and the brilliant acting performances only help create a more immersive story.

"ben_a_stephenson","10","7","24","1 July 2006"," Hard-hitting and honest portrayal of the troubles
","It's always interesting and intriguing to be presented with Ken Loach's version of events, particularly considering the amount of research he and Paul Laverty (his scriptwriter) put into the project, in order to realise Loach's socialist agenda of portraying the Irish in the way which they themselves believed to be treated, without reverting to prejudice. Indeed, if there is a message, it is certainly that of prejudice and how the British Army 'invaded' without any morals or humane strategy (parallels which of course can be drawn with the on-going Iraq war). However, the key aspect which continues to win me over with Loach is his attention to detail, particularly mise-en-scene, which provides him with a more prominent backdrop to provoke emotion within the audience. Quite simply, the cinematography is stunning, with wonderful long shots of the beautiful Irish countryside. There is always the argument within the right that Loach attempts to capitalise on every opportunity to criticise the Government, but this simply doesn't wash. Instead, he simply presents how Government policy affects the sections of society which those policies are not designed for. If anything, it is up to the audience themselves as to how sympathetic they are to the plight of Loach's characters, as Loach himself does not attempt to force the audience to believe in the way he does (which I don't); however, if other aspects of his personality are taken into account (through interviews etc.), only then do the audience become aware of his political persuasion, and can therefore apply it to the narrative more efficiently. The Wind that Shakes the Barley is a beautiful film, with wonderful acting by Cillian Murphy and Orla Fitzgerald in particular, and thoroughly deserved the Palme D'or at Cannes this year (although Volver is also very good). I sincerely hope that Ken continues his strive for social justice and maintains the style apparent in TWTSTB and his previous bodies of work."

","While I agree with much of what my Irish cousins on here have to say - it is sad that they generalises so much about the views of the British public. The right wing media do not represent the knowledge and views of us all. I may be more a little more aware than many, as a Scot of Irish stock, but I have to say my own experience suggests that people have more knowledge, empathy and understanding than you have all been le to believe!<br/><br/>As for the film - as always Ken Loach allows the characters to tell the tale in such a human and natural way. beautiful cinematography, sensitive performances, and a realistic, unsentimental representation of how it was. My grandparents made a big thing of being Scots, and my Irish roots were all but denied, it was so hard to be an immigrant, be accepted and find work. (then as now!) This for me is their stories, my history, and I thank Ken Loach for being the voice of ordinary people, in all of his films. from Glasgow, from Greenock, from Ireland from Spain, from Nicaragua, he relates their struggles, gives us a taste, a memory, a sense of being there. He is a true poet. PS - My husband is a thoroughbred Englishman, and he loved the film too!"
"hughchal-2","8","7","24","27 June 2006"," Uncomfortably good.
","Predominantly I liked it, but I think that Loach was opening a can of worms (for the British viewers) dealing with that subject matter. The British don't like being portrayed as bastards, just like we don't like being portrayed as drunken Micks.<br/><br/>There's a lot of sentimental drivel in it, but whether that's down to the writing, the direction or just having to explain it in its basic form to the American market I can't decide. There's obviously a lot of improv going on in the court scenes around the development of the Civil War story, and this made me feel a bit uncomfortable because some of the lead characters fluff their words and are thus unconvincing. Maybe that's just the way Loach does his thing, but it sort of spoiled the mood for me. Maybe another few weeks in the cutting room would've helped.<br/><br/>But overall it's good. It was a bit of a refresher for me in the history department, because I didn't do history after I was 15 (neither today nor yesterday) and had forgotten the reasons for the Civil War. The movie emphasized the horribleness of that war with brothers fighting brothers and cousins fighting cousins. Very divisive.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy was grand, albeit a bit fey. I liked Liam Cunningham a lot and Orla Fitzgerald, although I think she's a lot bigger that her token role."
"dm_orourke-1","10","7","24","26 June 2006"," A truly ground-breaking film
","I feel this film is a momentous achievement for all concerned in its making. It works on a number of levels: chiefly in its examination of how the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War affected a small community in County Cork - which was typical of many such communities throughout the country - and it has echoes of imperialist wars, most notably in Iraq today. The powerful acting of the whole cast is most obvious; the artful direction of Mr Loach; and the spare screenplay. It seems quite a violent film, but actually the instances of violence are fairly rare; rather a constant feeling of danger or menace pervades throughout. This is a film to make all Irish people ponder on the birth of their state and the recent state of affairs on the Island. It should make thoughtful people question the role and consequences of imperialist military action in the 21st Century."

Recent history gets to be told because England has lost its empire and we can now tell our story and educate the British about there involvement in Ireland because i genuinely think they have not a clue about it. I have heard so many British people say its anti-British, thats a bit like saying all those world war 2 movies are anti-Germany. For a long long time we have had to put up with not telling our history, for fear it would incite more violence or cause offense to the great British public, well i say enough is enough, they have had their say (take Ryans Daughter for instance, a truly terrible anti-Irish movie). This film is based on fact, every incident in it actually happened to somebody in Cork at the time and worse.

The 1970s documentary on Michael Collins, Hang Up Your Brightest Colours, was banned by the BBC for over 20 years. Gordon Brown has recently been trying to prove his ""British"" credentials by talking up the Empire as a good thing which many ignorant British still want to cling to to and can do so as the facts are suppressed.<br/><br/>In India there was a furore over Attenborough's 1982 Gandhi, as true to British mythology, the Gandhi, Nehru, Mountbatten - all good friends underneath mythology was upheld. Subhas Chandra Bose, Nehru's main rival for leadership of the Congress, who led the Indian National Army which fought with the Japanese, did not exist for Attenborough! Like Roger Casement, Bose had sought help from Germany and travelled in a German U-boat. The mutiny by the Indian Navy, the INA show trial in 1946, Indian troops refusing to leave barracks and white troops slaughtering striking workers in Bombay (the real reason why the British realised they had to go) was airbrushed from history! As the British turned back the Japanese advance in Burma, Bose read ""The History of the Irish Freedom Struggle"" and the failed INA adventure followed by the INA show trial, like Dublin 1916, instilled the spirit of freedom into India.<br/><br/>Furthermore, in 60 years, the British media has only once shown a programme on the 3 million death toll inflicted by the artificial famine the British created in Bengal in 1942-3 (C4's The Forgotten Famine, 1997). The British exported India's foodgrains and let the natives starve. Satyajit Ray's ""Distant Thunder"" is about this famine. Whilst the less than 1m Partition deaths are repeatedly highlighted as in 2007, no mention is made of such British-inflicted famine Holocausts which occurred throughout British rule, Bengal 1770 (the great famine), 8 million dead in S.India 1870s and 19 million in W.India 1890s (according to The Lancet) due to British ""let the poor starve"" Social Darwinist policies as also occurred in Ireland in the 1840s where the British also exported Ireland's dairy produce under army protection whilst the natives died in their millions! American historian Mike Davis discusses these famines in Late Victorian Holocausts. Still in 2001, Thatcherite Niall Ferguson in the Daily Mail wrote of Kipling's ""White Man's Burden"" repeating brazenly false Kipling myths of heroic British saving starving natives!!!<br/><br/>Also in the 1940s, the British refused American advice to build aircraft in India to fight the Japanese as no industrialisation which might help an independent India compete with Britain was to allowed after the Brits had plantationised our economy.<br/><br/>Thus when the British Right tries to dismiss the facts about the Black and Tans etc. ask them why Hitler loved the British film, Lives of a Bengal Lancer and wrote in Mein Kampf that he wanted Ukraine as his India!

There is one particular scene where I found myself shaking, and being there, and feeling the event. People crying on screen matched people crying in the cinema. The great camera work and editing of this scene helped.<br/><br/>Just at the end of the crisis point, the film started playing upside-down and in reverse, a stuff-up from whoever connected the film rolls I'd guess. The whole audience started laughing their heads off. We needed that relief of tension. After 15 minutes they'd fixed the issue and we watched the rest. That technical stuff-up did not stop me loving this movie.<br/><br/>Irish version of Braveheart?<br/><br/>Momentarily I felt ashamed of being half-English but it passed as I realised this story needs to be told... To stop history repeating and to send reverberations into soldiers & civilians tied up in conflicts around the world today.<br/><br/>Haven't stopped thinking about it.

","I enjoyed this film on the whole, and especially to start with, but towards the end it really was utter rubbish. Like many people, I can't understand why it's taken so long to make a film about this. Neither do I understand why a film with plenty of characters slating Michael Collins as a sell-out has nobody even mention Eamonn DeValera once. Maybe everybody would get up and hiss or walk out. That thief nationalised all my grandfather's land! All the fuss about this movie has been about the alleged anti-British stuff. As a born and bred Brit with an Irish father, I have no complaints there at all, except for the English accents on the Black and Tans, which doesn't make any sense. But once it got the civil war, it was so one-sided and unrealistic I didn't care about the ending at all. You can't fight a war without money or guns. Sorry Cillian, no opportunity for your fine performance to be affecting as a result."
"seanos","8","4","13","8 July 2006"," This film is smarter than its fans - this is not just a UK-America bashing film
","A lot of the above comments may leave you thinking this film is a one-sided metaphor against American/British ""imperialism"", or that somehow the atrocities of some British during the time of the Black-and-Tans and the occupation of Ireland are a direct corollary to the current situation in Iraq.<br/><br/>Perhaps to the simple minded they are, but in fact there is much more of worthy reflection in this movie, and indeed the bulk of the film deals with the internal conflict of the Irish coming to their own rule of their own land. That is of course the situation which is most relevant to the situation in Iraq today, and ultimately, it is the thing that actually gives one hope through all the tragedy portrayed in this film.<br/><br/>Ultimately of course, the Americans, the British, and the rest of the Coalition are irrelevant in Iraq (other than in their role of ending the Saddam/Uday/Qusay dictatorship). The struggle in Iraq, other than that shown by the media (which seems to think that the only thing the world cares about is British/American troops and western hostages), is between Iraqis for the future of their country. <br/><br/>(I say this having spent 18 months in Iraq outside the ""Green Zone"" as both a journalist and humanitarian worker, so I'm not entirely ignorant).<br/><br/>*possible spoilers below?*<br/><br/>There are several scenes, such as the scene of the Irish courtroom, where the turmoils of self-governance at its birth and the conflicts it produces really create pause for reflection. This is done in a short scene in which a (grossly non-sympathetic) businessperson is ordered to pay money to the (sympathetic) person who actually owes him money. The military struggles to control/circumvent the court. The court dictates an apparently irrational punishment as a reflection of their blindly socialist and pro-poor ideals. The movie brings the reality of the ugly and unruly birth of a nation to light. Who will win, the pragmatics, the idealists, the power-hungry, the men with guns?<br/><br/>Ultimately, it appears, the men with guns. Especially those that are willing to do the most ugly and brutal things in a fight for ""freedom"". In a hint of the distortions of the power- hungry, the script shows that these supposedly idealistic men use propaganda to convince the poor public that through socialism, the overthrow of a government will result in somehow their lot improving (leaflets guaranteeing land distribution, etc). <br/><br/>Yet despite all that, Ireland stands today as a democratic country that has a recent history of non-violence and an orientation towards disproportionately high charitable giving in its population. It is today a country which is ragingly capitalistic, but with a notable level of public health care, socialistic ideals, etc. <br/><br/>Yes, there are hypocrisies in all societies, but what is strong about this movie is that, for the bulk of it, it doesn't simply point the finger at the British and say how horrible they are (and, as a corollary, OK sure, both Saddam and the Black-and-Tans were horrible, I'm not apologizing for them), but it points instead to the real challenge, which is the internal struggle for human leadership and justice. And the difficulty and grey vs. grey nature of that struggle.<br/><br/>Other than a few relatively weak but necessary scenes of ambushes, training, etc., the bulk of the movie is about this struggle for self-governance and leadership and critical thinking. And so this is as relevant to Venezuela and East Timor and Mexico and the United States as it is for Iraq or Ireland or the UK.<br/><br/>Throughout Baghdad you can buy DVDs for 1500 dinars (1 euro), Asian-made knock-offs of American films, sometimes even before the films are in general release. I hope Mr. Loach made his DVD with Arabic subtitles so those who have the most at stake by watching it have a chance to see his film.<br/><br/>Regarding the cinematography, I live outside of Cork (Ireland), so I actually think of course that the land here is much more beautiful and cinematic than what is shown in the picture. Of course it could have used more crane shots, better lighting,and better effects, but all is forgiven in the interest of encouraging movies that don't require Hollywood budgets. To be specific, the impact of scenes like the one of the sharpshooter shooting a pack of cigarettes off a rock would have been more impressive if it didn't look like he was only 15 feet away... why they used a long lens and panned rather than using a wide angle lens to make the sharpshooter look far away and thus competent, I don't know! And, there were a couple of battle scenes where the actors just seemed to ""play dead"". Maybe there is an artistic reason why they didn't use squibs to show blood, but it was weird. For example the execution scene where you think, OK, that guy just took 8 bullets and he's dead, but he's not even bleeding across his white shirt?<br/><br/>But ultimately this isn't a special effects movie, it's a story of internal conflict, and the uncertainty and egos and internal codes of conduct which drive people to do insane things. And that is where it is useful and relevant for our world today. <br/><br/>The film says a lot about human nature and impossible struggles. I recommend it."

","The Wind That Shakes the Barley seems like an answer to Liam Neeson's acclaimed biographical film Collins. And curiously enough the answer is given by another Irish actor who states Neeson is a mentor of sorts to him.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is the star of this film and he's an Irish Republican Army member, recruited in much the same fashion that Don Murray was in Shake Hands With the Devil, an incident with the British auxiliary Black and Tans radicalizes him and turns him into a patriot. Murphy joins the brigade with good friend Padriac Delaney and the two become comrades in arms.<br/><br/>Comes the signing of the treaty that is so well portrayed in Collins and we see the different attitudes of both men. Delaney is for and Murphy against the treaty. Each brings powerful arguments to bear on his side and each is completely convinced of the rightness of his position. The split between treaty and non-treaty advocates defined Irish politics for the next couple of generations, their political parties were formed on that issue. It's a lot like the split between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton defined our political parties although in Ireland it was a lot more bloody. Not shown in The Wind That Shakes the Barley is the half a dozen years of civil war in the twenties that was more bloody and costly than the original war growing out of the election of Sinn Fein advocates to the British Parliament and those members forming the initial Irish Parliament.<br/><br/>Murphy and Delaney head a very capable cast of Irish players telling a story of a terrible part of their history. I'd recommend seeing this film to anyone who wants to know about Ireland of the last century."

"johnnyboyz","8","2","5","17 December 2008"," Saddening and harrowing film that takes on a scenario to do with occupation before going down a route of questioning one's loyalties towards others within.
","The Wind That Shakes the Barley is the second film I've seen in recent times that recreates an historical setting and uses the English as a source of antagonism, the other being Braveheart. The great thing about these two films are their resistance to daft demonisation of the English and their triumph in putting across a humbling, or perhaps in this film's case, quite a frightening account of the sorts of people whom existed and the events that occurred in Ireland in the early 1920s. I think it's somewhat of a triumph for Ken Loach to present this story within this time and setting and not give either 'side' any particular preference, more so tell a story of an oppressed nation before veering off into a realm in which how control of a nation between two domestically opposing sides would play out.<br/><br/>What elevates The Wind That Shakes the Barley over other films such as Munich or Schindler's List, both Spielberg films attempting to be 'serious', is that is doesn't necessarily take a certain side. We're all supposed to feel really bad when a Jew is executed in Schindler's List and rightly so and when that nasty German gets his comeuppance, there is a distinct thrill that the 'evil' has been defeated for all caused earlier. Similarly, when a Palestinian is wiped out in Munich by one of the Israeli agents, we're supposed to get another kick out of seeing a 'bad guy' get his just deserts following the introduction of events in the first five minutes. In this film, there are no thrills or kicks in seeing opposing forces hunt each other down or execute one another in retaliation for prior events; just a sombre and nasty feeling that humanity failed all those decades ago.<br/><br/>In another sense, it isn't played for entertainment. When we're presented with a group of English soldiers going about their brutal business on innocent Irish folk, we feel bad; when the Irish retaliate, we feel even worse and then the English get one back on them and we feel even worse still. It's that unrelenting and brutally efficient action-reaction that draws you into this film, all within the opening forty minutes or so, before opening up into another sort of beast entirely.<br/><br/>The film follows a young man, a young man of great knowledge given the fact he's a budding doctor and a young man whose career role demands he help or aid people. But the young man is a patriot, and he levels he finds himself attaining shock the audience. The young man is Damien, someone on the brink of leaving Ireland for England itself to begin his illustrious career working in a hospital were it not for the beating of a train crew at the station he was due to depart from. The beating tilts Damien over the edge as to whether he'll stay or leave; this followed the beating of one of his own friends after a hurling match. The scene in which Damien witnesses the station beating tells us that if he were to stay, it would not be purely for his friends and family who are at risk but more-so for all involved. He did not know the train crew in that scene but he is willing to stay behind and fight for the cause, not just for friends but for unknowns as well and this sets up a compassionate resonance in the audience's minds for this character.<br/><br/>The film is divided as a tale about dealing with oppression and then the struggles the Irish had with one another regarding a new order following a British ultimatum. Initially, the film is a scale waving towards Irish and British acts of violence. Some of the more harrowing scenes include a torture session involving fingernails and later on, a captain or figure of higher order, being executed after having handed over letters to his executor addressed to his family telling them how much he loves them and that they will not meet again in this life. The film is a grimy and no-holds-bared look at this sort of set up, echoing the work achieved in another 2006 film entitled Black Book as a sort of look at a depressing and downright dangerous way to live although feeling distinctly obligatory given they're fighting for a right.<br/><br/>But it is the announcement of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that proves to be a turning point in the film. The trigger for the Irish Civil War from June 1922 does not force the film down a route of political intrigue and mind-games complete with espionage more than it does create a pot-boiler in which allies must weigh up possibilities and Damien must come to terms with a new romantic interlude on top of things. The Wind That Shakes the Barley works because it's told from a perspective that really matters and initially, that perspective is of the victims'. Like films such as The Pianist and Come and See, a delicate and fragile hero is placed within a situation created by politics and hatred and the person must undergo certain changes whilst taking on certain duties, and it is harrowing just as it is fascinating all the same."
"pfgpowell-1","8","2","5","20 November 2008"," A subtle and honest account the Irish Republic's genesis.
","When it was released, The Hand That Shakes The Barley garnered all-to-predictable condemnation from several right-of-centre commentators. They concentrated on the film's portrayal of the notorious Black and Tan mercenaries as ruthless, sadistic and murderous - well - mercenaries, decried Loach's film as a treacherous attack on Britain, his mother country, and generally wrote the film off as worthless leftist propaganda. Well, whether wilfully or not, they miss the point entirely.<br/><br/>Loach has produced a far more subtle film, and it is a film which demands a more considered response. It doesn't help that Loach has a reputation as an uncompromising left filmmaker, and many feel that rules him out from the start. But given Loach's politics, The Wind does not take easy shots. The ruthlessness of the Black and Tan is a matter of record, as is England's shameful history of brutal repression in Ireland from the days of Elizabeth I on. And anyone who feels such points, whenever they are made, are merely pro-Irish, anti-English propaganda should be asked to explain English brutality in the Highland Clearances. Why, not an Irishman in sight.<br/><br/>As for The Wind That Shakes The Barley, Loach's approach is never as broad-brush as his critics claim. For example, the Black and Tans are ruthless, and shown to be brutal, but Loach has one character, an English officer, indicate obliquely just why: after spending four years fighting in the Great War trenches and seeing comrades slaughtered, it is not surprising that they should have become brutalised. This does not justify their behaviour, but does to some extent offer an explanation.<br/><br/>Loach also has one Black and Tan trooper, revolted by what he is part off, help Irish republican soldiers escape and then join them.<br/><br/>More tellingly, the film's earlier scenes of Black and Tan behaviour is juxtaposed with equally nasty behaviour by Free State troops against their own when, after the Treaty is signed. the tragic civil war pitched brother against brother.<br/><br/>Loach is also admirably more even-handed than his critics would allow in his exposition of the dilemma faced by Ireland: should they settle for what is on offer, a Free State and pledging allegiance to the English Crown now and pursue a longer-term strategy for gaining complete independence? Or should the reject this pragmatic compromise and carry on the fight until they have achieved complete independence? This is the dilemma which split the country in two and which saw the murder of Michael Collins as a man regarded by the more purist republicans as a patsy who, seduced by the good living in his Knightsbridge, London, headquarters, had sold out to the English.<br/><br/>Loach's even-handed approach has him (and his excellent scriptwriter Paul Laverty) have a character, the one brother, spell out Britain's own dilemma: if they allow full independence to Ireland (and even the more limited concessions Lloyd George and Winston Churchill made to Collins took the Irish by surprise), they would be inviting trouble form their other dominions - Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India - which legitimately ask 'if the Irish, then why not us, too?' (One might or might not like what the British Empire was and represented, but any honest man is bound to concede that that was a hell of a political dilemma. From the English point of view, the substance of the Treaty was the wisest course of action.) As for the film itself, Loach, who apparently always works on a shoestring, does well. The cinematography is up to the standard of some of the best high budget Hollywood and Bollywood films, and the acting is without exception top-notch. My guess is that the actors were also, to some, extent spurred on to give such moving performances by the tragic subject matter of the script.<br/><br/>One, very silly reviewer (in Britain's Daily Telegraph) described this as more or less a soap opera which gave a mawkish portrayal of rural Irish life. Don't believe a word of it. There is nothing sentimental or mawkish here. Instead, there are several quite outstanding and powerful scenes: when an English landlord is executed and then his stable-hand, a youth the IRA have known all their lives, is also shot; when the pragmatic IRA commander sets free a greedy businessman, who is bilking a pensioner and has been temporarily jailed by a Republican state court, because the IRA needs his money to buy weapons; the debate between the two factions which follows that scene; the sermon by the parish priest who despairs as to what is going on in his country, only to see the more hard-line, purist republicans walk out of church; the scene where the one brother pleads with his harder line brother to co-operate and save himself from the firing squad.<br/><br/>Finally, what is telling is that Loach does not come down on the side of either brother. From the point of view of the Irish, both courses of action - take what's on offer or fight on for more - were legitimate.<br/><br/>The tragedy was that the Irish nation tore itself apart over which course of action to take. Wisely and honestly, Loach concedes that neither faction had right on its side and to have pretended otherwise would have diminished this film gravely. For the record and in view of what other reviewers claim, I don't feel Loach sided with anyone.<br/><br/>I often make the point that there are films which win us over and whose flaws and slight faults we are thus inclined to overlook. Then there are films which, for whatever reason, fail to win us over and whose flaws and slight faults count all the more against them. The Wind That Shakes The Barley won me - and Englishman and by no means 'of the left' - over entirely. It is more subtle than similar work and an intelligent and moving account of the tragic early years of the Irish Republic."
"s_jackson-1","7","2","5","30 March 2008"," Shaken but not entirely stirred.
","All in all, I thought this was quite good but NOT the best I've seen from Loach. Somehow I felt it a bit insubstantial in terms of plot and hard to really feel for the characters.<br/><br/>What I really appreciated was the historical context Loach provided about a time most of us in Britain know little about. (Why isn't the winding down of the British Empire part of the school syllabus? Least, it wasn't when I did history.) This included the treatment of not just anti-British feeling, but how and why the Irish became divided among themselves, thus giving rise to the continued fight of the IRA, with all its repercussions on the rest of the 20th century, and still today.<br/><br/>Of course, the Brits in this are portrayed as wholly Bad Guys, which is used to make a point. I think, though, that's what I missed - a more nuanced treatment of the people involved. Ultimately, in fact, I felt this detracted from really feeling for the relationships of Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald) and Damien (Cillien Murphy), and of Teddy (Padraic Delaney) with Damien, both of which are pivotal to the closing stages."

","Saw this film last nite at a second-run/art house theater. Knew practically nothing of it beforehand. Amazing that one reader believed the film would not be released in the UK. The film did spur me to read more about Irish-Anglo history, and I would like other readers' input. Seems that Damien is a stand-in for Eamon de Valera (deft touch that his girlfriend was named Sinead). Was Teddy a fictionalization of Michael Collins or Arthur Griffith? I noticed a reader's challenge that Americans would view the republican cause through the prism of today's IRA. Quite the opposite for me. I did not equate the formative years of the IRA as depicted in the film as representative of modern-day versions. However, before this film I did not know how much socialist or communist influence there was in Sinn Fein's (and by extension the IRA's) philosophy at the time. I don't think those ideals have retained their currency in the modern incarnations. Despite my distaste and disdain for brutality on either side of the issue, I can appreciate the desire for independence and self-determination, and in light of the centuries of brutal repression, from Henry VIII and Cromwell's Puritans on down, this film has engendered more sympathy in me for the republican cause, if not for the modern IRA's armed struggle."
"jaredmobarak","10","3","10","8 May 2007"," I try to get out and can'tThe Wind That Shakes the Barley
","Finally a war film, a genre which I could do without due to the fact that few really need to be seen twice by me, has come along to give me reason to feel for the cause and the men fighting for it. Ken Loach's The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a truly moving portrait of a nation desperately wanting to be free from the clutches of the tyrant English. This is a small film and as a result relies immensely on its characters to drive the pace along rather than heavily orchestrated battle scenes, however, when we get gunshots, the moments do not disappoint. What could be the smallest scale war epic I've seenit could very well pack the biggest punch.<br/><br/>This film is definitely about the IRA's fight for a free and autonomous Ireland, but at its heart it is about the Irish and how their lives and customs lead them forward into the battle. In order to get the audience engaged into the fight, we are given a pair of brothers to root for and care dearly about. Damien (Cillian Murphy) and Teddy (Padraic Delaney) are caught in the middle of the fight and join up to help free themselves. Teddy is a leader of sorts who rallies those around him for a brutal attack on the enemy. Damien, on the other hand, is a doctor ready to leave the country and pursue his dream of helping the sick. Only after he sees firsthand the brutality of the armed occupants running wild inside his country does he realize that he is needed at home more. Damien becomes his brother's second hand man and slowly watches his own soul disappear, turning into a shell of man with only victory and freedom on his mind. A man once living to help those in need, he soon finds that the cause calls for him to cross the line into territory he can never cross out of again until the victory is complete and final.<br/><br/>What really hit home while watching the movie was the brilliant acting by both Murphy and Delaney. The two are strong individuals who have the confidence to watch out for one another but also to question the validity of what they are doing. As the film evolves, we soon find that the two brothers slowly change, almost into how the other began the story. Our early look into this is when, after a court decision finds a man guilty, Teddy takes the man out of the bailiff's hands and out into the street. He says that the man is needed to bankroll their weaponry and prolong the fight for freedom. His brother Damien is quick to call him out, though, saying how by not upholding the court they would be no better than the British. It is then OK to have ideals to fight for, but during the course of the war they don't necessarily need to uphold them to battle for them. This scene is an integral turning point as we are finally shown the strength of mind Damien has built up, the fight his sibling started needed to be fought the right way and the reasons for his fight could not be compromised. On the flip side of the coin, though, Teddy shows that compromise is not something he is adversely opposed to. Small victories seem to be enough for him, but you can't watch your kinsmen die around you for less than what you set out to accomplish.<br/><br/>The beauty here is in the dialogue heavy sequences between the IRA as they contemplate what to do next. Scenes like those in the jail cell once turned in by one of their own, or discussing whether a treaty with the British should be ratified, or the editorializing from their priest during Sunday mass tell more with words than any battle scene could. At its core, the fight for Irish freedom was one of politics and idealism, the war and death was only an accompaniment. The war of words showed more direct hits than the ambushes planned as a result to send their messages. I also must credit writer Paul Laverty and his fantastic cyclical story. The allusions at the end to moments from the start really weigh on a viewer's conscience, slowly uncovering the true motives behind these men we have been rooting for throughout. When Delaney's Teddy finds himself in the exact same position as his brother having to deal with a traitor at the start, it is truly heartbreaking to watch his face as he realizes what he must do. This is truly a war that turns from driving out a common enemy to civil unrest, as the man who fought by your side soon becomes a proxy for the entity you battled to rid yourself of. One can't expect a soldier that is told victory is the only option to be happy with anything short of it. Sometimes you train those you love a little too well.<br/><br/>The way these men fought, for a goal as important as freedom, while never losing their faith or conviction, is truly inspiring. Each man, no matter how brutal or unapologetic for the actions they must take, never forgets himself or the God he cherishes. Before any execution, the victim is allowed to write his goodbyes to those he loves and they are given to God as men. After each death, the sign of the cross is given in prayer for the fallen. The Irish are big Catholics and it is this attention to detail that gives the story its heart and emotional resonance. Loach never shows us robots fighting because they are told tono, these are men fighting for what they believe in and if not for themselves, then their children who will one day live as all humanity should, completely free and accountable to no one."

","Alright, I readily agree that I'm not Irish, but I walked away from ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"", with a new-found interest in the history of the IRA.<br/><br/>For that, I'm pretty grateful, because the movie is really effective at showing what it means to be committed to a cause for the long haul. The movie is set during a pivotal time, just before the Treaty of 1921, which forever divided not only geographical borders, but the border that runs between the hearts and souls of Irish and British alike.<br/><br/>Yet, something was missing...something so basic and simple. Yes, we saw the men training and fighting. And yes, we observed IRA members passionately discussing ideas and strategy. Let's not forget to mention we witnessed a lot of killing, too. But the movie as a whole left me emotionally unmoved. I can't say I became emotionally invested in any of the characters, perhaps because they were so sparsely drawn and so woodenly acted. How did this movie win a Sundance award?<br/><br/>Why did I have to plow through most of the movie to find out the title character was trained as a physician? Where was a bit of back story? Maybe a couple of scenes of non-combat interaction between the IRA soldiers and townspeople (the ones they were fighting for, remember?). The script relied on dialog to supply a few bits and pieces, but I felt as though the writer and director got together and said, ""Look, let's just drop the audience right in the middle of this situation, and let them fend for themselves."" <br/><br/>Perhaps this little film, showing a tiny slice of history, was meant to be just that. After all, it got me reading about Irish history, didn't it?"

The ""stage"" Irish caricatures which somehow don't ring true. 2. The lack of in-depth character development, poor acting and weak storyline. 3. The extreme violence present in practically the whole film. 4. The historical inaccuracies, for example, presenting the anti-treaty people as Socialist, whereas in reality their opposition to the Treaty was anti-British rather than anti-capitalist. 5.

I couldn't stop thinking about the film for days after seeing it. The characters were fantastic, particularly Liam Cunningham and Cillian Murphy, and the debates were very well done in the style only Ken Loach seems capable of capturing: honest, harsh, clumsy and eloquent. It was a harsh and ultimately sad film, a true reflection of the times. The slating of this film as 'pro-terrorist' or 'pro-republican' is typical of someone who hasn't bothered watch it or is so blinkered by the old colonial view that any challenge to the Crown forces is an act of terrorism. There were terrorists on both sides, with the British Black and Tans being exceptionally brutal in their methods. This was a product of sending battle-hardened, illiterate and working-class British soldiers from the trenches of World War 1 France run riot throughout the island of Ireland under direct orders from the top brass. <br/><br/>Another excellent piece of work from Ken Loach.

"jbor90","10","3","10","19 August 2006"," A well crafted historically important and informative film
","The historical reasons why the Irish republicans were fighting for the same end but could not agree on the methods, imparts important information for anyone who may be drawn into conflicts in other parts of the world. The film says that conflicts are never simple; it is essential to understand the history behind a conflict before deciding on any course of action, and then a great deal of thought must be given to any purposeful action. That seemed to relate to anywhere connected to the British empire and its mandate, because the British Empire seemed always to depart leaving another intractable problem in their wake. Innocent bystanders always get hurt in conflict and turmoil. Simply being there is not a defence against mindless brutality. Some people had no choice but to react with brutality. There was also a warning about reactionary laws rushed in without being thought through.<br/><br/>Ken Loach's timing is impeccable. The film was informative and realistic, sad and humorous, evocative and earthy. The music was integral to the ethnicity and culture of the backdrop, but understated rather than overblown. A less flamboyant film than ""Michael Collins"", it neatly compliments that film and dovetails by providing an essential précis to the background of a person from Collins' upbringing, influences and environment in West Cork, without overtly dominating the film."

","I think the film was a really good insight into the fight for freedom. I think it was about time that ignorant British people seen what the army was like in those days. As i stay in the UK myself i know how biased they are. Even in school every history lesson is biased always making Britain out to be the ""good ones"" and this certainly isn't true. i think this film should be shown in every cinema throughout Britain and then people might actually come to their senses about what the army were really like. in fact i think their should be a film out about the hunger strikers and the whole history as it isn't fair that people don't really have the chance to find out about it."

","Ken Loach is well known for never transitioning to mainstream Hollywood as many of his contemporaries have, thus it was no surprise to me when I heard about the alleged controversy surrounding this film.<br/><br/>Set In Ireland 1920, the film deals with the unrest that stemmed between the Irish guerrillas fighting for a free Ireland against the British. The film portrays a rather sympathetic view of these fighters, although the characters are indeed well developed - Cillian Murphy is particularly excellent (a big step up from the rather banal 'Red Eye') A powerful story of two brothers journey to find freedom in a part of history that is often forgotten due to its close proximity to the end of World War I; the injustices and terror that plagued thousands of innocent Irish people as Britain tried to keep its tenure on the Empire.<br/><br/>I can see why many English people would find this film offensive; virtually every English character, especially the soldiers are one-dimensional monsters that beat, rape and kill without mercy and that is perhaps my only grips with the film. Yet I can see why it was done - to highlight in the rawest possible way the atrocities that were committed during this time period.<br/><br/>However, Loach does well in portraying the confusion that builds up within the Irish protesters, especially once the treaty which established Northern Ireland is signed, the best scenes of the film indeed exploit this confusion and what is considered traitorous acts or what is 'needed to be done'.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is a powerful story that is shot and told very well, the acting is solid and characters well developed. The film also won the Palme d'Or at Cannes 2006 so it is encouraging that people looked past the only negative of the film (that of the one-dimensional English apart from a select few) and saw the story for the powerful and emotional journey that it is."

","""I hope this Ireland we're fighting for is worth it."" <br/><br/>A country fighting to the death to reject the occupation by a stronger one. Iraq? Brothers turn on each other as they take sides in a bloody, irrational war? The Civil War? Neither. It is County Cork, Ireland, in the early 1920's, depicted in The Wind That Shakes the Barley, as good a primer as you will ever see on the struggle against the occupation of Great Britain that over 80 years later remains a bitter reality for Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Although Neil Jordan's Crying Game (1992) treats the conflict figuratively and delicately in an unconventional love story, Ken Loach's Wind deals directly with the brutality and loss, the daily humiliations and murders the Northern Irish endured before and after the Anglo-Irish treaty of 1921 at the hands of an amoral occupier.<br/><br/>The photography is emerald gorgeous and low key to accentuate the ambivalence in the country and its households. Loach told Cannes, ""If you were alive at that time, it must have been an agonizing choice. There were no good people or bad people; all responses to the situation have a logic  that's the terrible dilemma."" The weakness of the film is its dogged one-sidednessIrish good, Brits bad. Similarly could the US be depicted in Iraq if the story were told only through the eyes of the Iraqis. Although Wind is based on a true story, it makes no attempt to understand or explain the occupiers. British press has loudly criticized Loach for depicting a time they have yet to sort out. Some compare him to Hitler's favorite biographer and Third Reich enabler, brilliant documentarian Leni Riefenstahl.<br/><br/>As lead Irish character Damien (Cillian Murphy) says, ""I tried not to get into this war, and did, now I try to get out, and can't."" So too in Crying Game does the lead IRA character say to the photo of a dead British soldier, ""You should have stayed home."" As Joseph Conrad said of Congo occupation by many countries and villains, they were there ""with no more moral purpose at the back of it than there is in burglars breaking into a safe."" The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a moving evocation of the terror of occupation seen from the point of view of the occupied. But then some of the occupiers didn't seem to relish the mess either. We don't seem to have the stomach for it either."

"moviesleuth2","5","2","7","15 August 2009"," Having your heart and mind in the right place doesn't mean success
","It's kind of ironic that a British filmmaker would direct a film about the Irish Revolution from the point of the Irish. And believe me, director Ken Loach doesn't seem to have any mixed feelings about his countrymen. The British in his film are portrayed as violent ""thugs"" who harass and kill Irish civilians as they please, and save for one of them, show no qualms about doing so. This makes it easy for the viewer to side with the Irish protagonists. Unfortunately, that's one of the very few things that the film does right.<br/><br/>Damien O'Donnell (Cillian Murphy) is a bright young man about to leave his native Ireland to go to Britain to become a doctor. But his countrymen are struggling against the British forces who are keeping the Irish in check, often violently. So Damien abandons his plans for a future and joins the Irish Republican Army to drive the British out.<br/><br/>Ken Loach's vision of the story, from a script by Paul Laverty, is unique. Loach uses a small Irish town as a representation of the whole of Ireland. This isn't a new way of telling a story like this; filmmakers often use characters as symbols of ideas. But Loach's approach is different. These are just ordinary people, not personifications. While that certainly opens the doors for interesting explorations of small-town viewpoints and personalities (something that Loach takes advantage of), it makes it seem like these characters were the only ones fighting the British (something that was obviously not the case). Then again, this is beside the point.<br/><br/>""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" does more things wrong than it does right, and that's a shame, because there are some interesting aspects of the film that I haven't seen before (certainly not by any American filmmaker). One of the most interesting things that the film does is look at how nationalism and revolution conflict with small town life. All the principal characters have known each other all their lives, but they're fighting a war where they grew up. If a person betrays you and some of your comrades die because of it, naturally one would want to exact punishment. But what if the traitor is the neighbor down the street who you played sports with and ate dinner with his family? While this conflict is approached and competently explored, that's really the only thing that works (other than the cinematography, which is gorgeous). Loach keeps the characters at an arms distance. That's not necessarily a bad thing (liking the characters is not a requirement of every film, although it is here), but development is. The viewer needs a way into the story, and while Loach tries to make Damien the entry point, it doesn't work. Not because it's hard to identify with a person like Damien, but because Damien is sketchily developed. We never get a sense of who he is, and that makes it hard to identify with him. And sad to say, Damien is the most developed character in the film (the majority of the characters are recognizable only because we've seen them before in earlier scenes--I didn't know the names of anyone besides Damien, his girlfriend Sinead, his brother Teddy, and a few other unimportant characters).<br/><br/>But the biggest problem with the film is that it's poorly focused. I think that Ken Loach got a little ahead of himself with this film. He wanted to give rise to a few ideas with the film. That's a good thing, but it doesn't work unless they are well integrated into the story. Loach doesn't accomplish that. For the most part, he tells the story, but some scenes he completely loses sight of the characters and has them play out to serve the points he wants to make. While he can get his ideas across, they lack any effect because they distance us even more from the characters. Halfway through the film I didn't care about anyone.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy started his career as a villain, playing roles such as Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" movies and as Jackson Rippner in Wes Craven's non-horror thriller ""Red Eye."" With the role of Damien, Murphy is venturing into uncharted territory by playing a hero. Many actors do this, but Murphy has a disadvantage: he looks creepy to begin with. Surprisingly, his creepy facial features don't betray him in this role. Damien is a smart guy, but the way his countrymen are being treated at the hands of the British infuriates him, so he decides to fight back. After viewing his performance here, I think Murphy has considerable versatility, and I hope that he gets a chance to play some protagonist roles in the future. Orla Fitzgerald is also solid as Damien's lover, Sinead. She is in the same boat as everyone else, and it's obvious that she would be right beside them fighting if she weren't a woman (this takes place in the 1920's). Nevertheless, she does what she can to help the cause. Padriac Delaney is flat as Dan, however, although he doesn't play an important role until the final 20 minutes.<br/><br/>There are a few good things about ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley,"" but ultimately its shortcomings turn a potentially powerful film into a long, often tedious, 2 hour slog."

"Buddy-51","8","2","7","30 September 2007"," The Birth of a Nation
","Ken Loach's ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" is a stirring, beautifully realized film that chronicles Ireland's struggle for independence from English rule. The story is set in 1920, four years after the Easter Uprising, in which the citizens of this British-ruled isle unilaterally declared themselves to be a sovereign nation. To make that assertion a reality, bands of armed volunteers, calling themselves the Irish Republican Army, began fighting against the English troops who were suppressing, terrorizing and executing many Irish citizens during the time depicted in the movie. This war lasted from 1919-1921, resulting finally in a partitioned Ireland, consisting of an independent nation called the Irish Republic in the South and an area still voluntarily subject to British rule in the North.<br/><br/>However, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" (which takes its title from an old Irish folk song) is less concerned with the politics of the situation than with the human cost of war. The events of the story are seen mainly through the eyes of a promising young doctor named Damien (played by the fine actor, Cillian Murphy), who is at first reluctant to join the guerillas, believing the British army to be just too well armed and too well manned to be successfully overcome by such a piddling, homegrown force as the IRA. However, after witnessing some particularly brutal treatment of his people by English soldiers, Damien gives up his promising career as a doctor to become a passionate, full-time warrior in the cause of independence and freedom.<br/><br/>Writer Paul Laverty has constructed a simple, straightforward narrative that shows what life is like in a wartime setting. Damien understands that the cause he believes in so passionately is requiring him to commit acts he would never even dream of doing in a time of peace, including executing a boyhood friend of his for betraying him and his fellow fighters to the enemy. A war of freedom requires fortitude, sacrifice and courage from its participants, to be sure, but it also demands a part of their humanity as well. Damien soon learns that one often has to compromise one set of values in order to fulfill another. Laverty makes it plain that no one on either side of such a conflict will ever be able to live entirely at ease with his conscience even if the goal he is fighting for is eventually achieved. This is brought out with particular vividness in the second half of the film, after a treaty has been signed between England and Ireland, granting ""independence"" to the latter, though with many unsavory strings attached. It is at this point that the rebel forces spilt into two diametrically opposed factions and engage in a civil war, with men who were just recently allies suddenly turning their weapons against one another. Indeed, the pro-treaty fighters begin utilizing the same tactics of torture and terror against the anti-treaty fighters that the British forces had once used against them. This leads to a heartrending and shattering conclusion that exemplifies the horrifying personal cost of just such a conflict.<br/><br/>Through the character of Damien, Laverty and Loach turn what could have been a fascinating, if dry, history lesson into a deeply moving human drama that reminds us of the high price that often must be paid if future generations are to live in freedom. In its own subtle, understated way, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" shows us the birth pangs of a nation."
"Quinoa1984","9","2","7","21 March 2007"," a compelling tale of the dangers of imperial dominance, how it spreads, and how political turns personal
","The Wind That Shakes the Barley, the Palm D'Or winner, gets most compelling because of the ties that form between the political and the personal, between what is loyalty to one's country versus one's own blood and how the latter becomes almost irrelevant and taken for granted in the midst of the bickering of specifics. For a while, Ken Loach's film is suspenseful enough as a story of Irishmen rebelling against their dastardly British occupiers in militia-style tactics, practically guerrilla tactics actually, and there's not much sentimentality going on. But then when the Irish get a small sliver of independence, albeit still in servitude to the British empire, it sets off a chain reaction of infighting, of there being adequate freedom and not enough freedom, and two brothers- Damian and Teddy- get caught right in the works of it all, tragically so. Loach doesn't let either side off in this, and it adds to the complexities of the last third of the picture. Damian goes full circle as one who starts off not wanting to join the IRA, even after the death of a friend, but soon becomes more than he thought- a killer, of British as well as Irish (a troubling, tense scene where he has to take out a boyhood friend over treason)- and now sees that it's his duty to go for more than his brother settles for.<br/><br/>But Teddy is not put as a simple figure of a submissive Irishman completely, and the emotion that suddenly starts to boil over in his contention and eventual head-to-head with Damian helps to not make it too shallow or underdeveloped. Some critics have called Teddy unsympathetic, but it's not that easy an assertion: circumstance in the face of something that has never been attained before might seem worth it on one side, even if on the other it seems maddening. Beneath this, however all the clearer in the scenes with the British officers early in the film as a horrible brutes who will torture and kill to get control and dominance over the Irish, is Loach commenting on the dangers of imperialism, of how it becomes if not contagious then almost something that becomes accepted if seen as something that has to be taken for a little extra freedom. In the process, one can see parallels to current events, more or less, and that it's filmed in a very immediate, staggering fashion where melodrama is stripped away.<br/><br/>It would be one thing if Loach was making a simple message picture, and yet when it is loaded with 'message' like when the Irish argue over ratifying the treaty it's still very engrossing, but Loach is interested too in the impact on close-knit relationships: the connection with Damian and his love, who he has to watch in pain from hiding as British officers torture her and burn most of her home down; the lack in faith in institutions like the Church, connected to those in power; and finally Damian and Teddy, two sides of very courageous, yet proud figures. It would be wrong to consider that Damian and Teddy are direct representations of the two sides of the Irish struggle, those that oppose and those that support the treaty with the British, wherein the Northern part of Ireland was still indebted to England. There's more depth than that- neither of the brother's deep down really wants this, Teddy more than Damian as the film progresses despite his political convictions, as Damian, played in a very strong turn by Cillian Murphey, trained to be a doctor, not in any military or political faculty. One can't say for sure how much of The Wind That Shakes the Barley speaks to the people of Ireland of today, so many decades after North and South and the IRA have gone head-to-head, but it contains the spirit that thrives in the better war films of recent years where thought is taken as precedence over action (not that Loach is a bad action director), and the end result brings little happiness anywhere."
"edimac","8","2","7","20 July 2006"," Could have been brilliant
","This film is definitely worth a watch or two. It's entertaining all the way through, mainly because Loach can still handle actors better than anyone else. I think it's all probably adlib. I think historically accurate, but I've not really done any research or anything so don't quote me on that. Cillian Murphy whom I disliked beforehand has now assured himself as a very good actor, he's brilliant in this. It's all very powerful and upsetting in a few places, and is shot in a manner vaguely similar to the shakicam of Paul Greengrass. They seem to have toned this down though, I don't think the whole film in this style would fit the period at all.<br/><br/>So bad points. The ending dragged on a little. It's no lord of the rings, I just think it would have been much more powerful if it finished just after the rifles had all shot. I know Delaney's performance after this is very good but for the film's sake I think it should chop off there. But here's the biggy. Why o why did Loach agree to have a love interest. We see Damian our protagonist swanning around with this ""sinead"" and every time they met I was thinking, ""please don't let this become a lovey dovey thing"". It's not as though it takes over the whole film, but when they start to love each other and start to ""get down to business"" the audience's heads were shaking. It completely detracts from the whole story. Before this sinead and her female family seem to show the audience how the women were treated in the whole affair, and it all works, but her then becoming a love interest detracts from this a little, and we forget what this film is about.<br/><br/>So, pretty good overall, just the love interest got to me a little.<br/><br/>Could have been a nine but sorry Ken, this one's an eight."

","I was disappointed in this film. I had seen and admired some films of Ken Loach's before, but didn't make the connection. Elsewhere in the critiques of this film, one viewer derides the idea of providing English subtitles for a film nominally made in English. I disagree totally. If the dialogue is as mumbled, heavily accented and as poorly recorded as it was in The Wind that Shakes the Barley, it becomes difficult to follow the story. There was nothing wrong with the acting, unless you count the deliberately improvisational ""naturalistic"" delivery that always winds up sounding, to me, like actors improvising. Phony. Maybe if there had been subtitles I wouldn't have had to search for familiar syllables amongst the brogues. The story itself is worthwhile, in that it presents the same conflicts as The Informer and Michael Collins, but does so in terms of people in rural Ireland, and two brothers in particular. I was looking forward to the story; I got it, but missed a lot of the dialogue. It almost seems as if the director and sound man insisted, for reasons of authenticity, on using ambient recording over looping, and then did a crappy job of the ambient recording. It comes off as amateurish. These guys are pros? <br/><br/>There was one other minor issue that stuck out early in the film, possibly because of a bad edit: A group of men, at night, quietly pulls up beside the police barracks; one gets out and plants a large bomb against the stable(garage) door. He lights the fuse, then moves to another large door and is setting up a second bomb when he is interrupted, and the gang is forced to storm the barracks. The first bomb never goes off.

While Mel Gibson's Academy Award winner was set in the 13th Century with the Scots battling the English for independence, Wind tackles similar subject matter about oppression, the rallying to arms and the battle for independence, set in early 20th Century in Ireland, sandwiched between the two World Wars. As such, there are many parallels between the movies in terms of the politics behind the scenes, the arguments for and against their rationale of armed resistance and struggle, though Wind doesn't have the large scaled set action pieces for war, and it doesn't need to.<br/><br/>It takes a very intimate look at the historical background of the Irish Republican Army, as seen through the eyes of two brothers Damien (Cillian Murphy) and Teddy (Padraic Delaney). The movie doesn't waste time in establishing a rather biased fact, that the English troops are despised for their arrogance and the crimes that they commit among commonfolk, much like the Robin Hood days. It doesn't take two ticks for Damien to enlist with the IRA for their armed struggle against oppression witnessed by many, and soon enough they discover that their political ideals differ.<br/><br/>Yes, it's as much a talkie movie as it is one with action. Even without background of the politics of the time, you'll still be able to follow through much of the debate given passionate performances, and fiery speeches made from the heart, given the universal subject themes. As always the case, differing ideals become the crux of the issue, and that adage that power corrupts ring through, especially amongst those at the top echelons, the politicians versus the man on the street. What I thought was intriguing, was how freedom was negotiated, as a compromise rather that complete, yet with plans in the backburner on going against such agreements when one becomes more powerful - the classical giving an inch and taking a yard, when the time is correct, with a powerful base to work from.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy gives yet another commendable performance as Damien, a freedom fighter (or terrorist, depending on how you see it) fighting for the injustice he experiences and observes. Padraic Delaney too holds his own as Teddy the brother, and the two cannot be more different, especially when they stand for the same ideals, disagreeing on execution. One's an idealist, while the other doesn't mind compromise, but both share extreme pain in doing what they deem morally right.<br/><br/>Despite Spider-man's much awaited sequel making its debut worldwide this week, Wind is one movie that I'll recommend if summer blockbuster's aren't your cup of tea. Highly recommended."

","This is the first Ken Loach film I have seen. I was very surprised it reached Belgium at all, and presumably did because it won the Palme d'Or in Cannes. I am sorry to say that I saw this film on a Saturday night with the cinema only 25% full.<br/><br/>I am delighted that films like this are being made and are being recognised for their quality. Of course it is controversial, for several reasons, the portrayal of the violence and the ambivalence amongst the Irish, both during the armed action and after the treaty had been signed. However I cannot take issue with the veracity of what is portrayed. Many people will take issue with this, but before criticising, they should look at the history, which I think is being truly depicted here.<br/><br/>The performances were mostly admirable: I particularly liked Liam Cunningham's portrayal of the socialist idealist Dubliner amongst Cork men. I watched this film in the original language and with French subtitles: this was no problem for me because I understand Cork accents, but my bi-lingual wife had often to rely on the French subtitles, and I suspect that non-Irish people will have problems with some of the dialogue, even if they are native English speakers. However I realise that English sub-titles might have been regarded as some sort of political slur rather than an assistance to the audience.<br/><br/>This film differs widely from Neal Jordan's ""Michael Collins"" (one of my all time favourite films). Loach wisely made a completely different film, which tells the story of ordinary unknown people rather than the main historical figures of the time. It deals with action away from Dublin rather than the main events of the Easter Rising. Its major success is as an anti-war film; both during the armed action itself and through the political dialogue after the treaty was signed, the balancing issues are addressed - the brutality of the Black and Tans, the killing of the informer, and the teenage Scottish soldier who allowed the escape of the main characters. The three (yes three) strains of Irish politics were addressed, pro- and anti-treaty and the socialist view, and these must be regarded in the context of their relevance and validity at the time, rather than whether or not one regards these views as being valid in the context of 2006.<br/><br/>There is something about Loach's film making that is almost detached and unemotional: perhaps this is necessary in seeking the truth. His film left me angry that such things could happen, and are still happening in the world. On the other hand I left the cinema with dry eyes: this was not my reaction after seeing ""Micael Collins"".<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10, and looking forward to Ken Loach's next film"

","Last year's Palm D'Or winner. It was kind of a surprise winner, and opinions have been all over it. I haven't seen a lot of the official selections, but of the few I've seen, it's the second best after Almodóvar's Volver (one of my favorites of last year). It's the story of two brothers, Teddy and Damien (Pádraic Delaney and Cillian Murphy), who join the Irish Republican Army after witnessing several atrocities committed by occupying British soldiers. The IRA is basically an insurgent group, which will probably remind most audience members of Iraq. Perhaps this was Loach's intention, and perhaps this is even why the film took home the Palm D'Or. But, allegorically, it doesn't fit the Iraq situation particularly well. Neither the occupying force nor the rebel force of this story matches up very well with present-day Iraq. Plus, the film ends after the occupying force has left. The last third of the film occurs after the Irish parliament has signed a very compromising treaty, wherein they gain a sort of freedom, but are still considered a part of the United Kingdom. If they refused to sign, there would certainly have been war. The people are divided on this, and they begin to fight amongst themselves, including the two brothers. Really, this is a powerful film about the toil, the sacrifices and the stupidity of war. It kind of reminds me of Melleville's Army of Shadows, and even in a way of The Godfather. It contains several gut-wrenching sequences, well directed by Loach (this is my first film by him, for what it's worth). Reviewers who want to comment on the politics of the film are pretty much ignoring that last and most crucial part of this film. The film is solely about the Irish, not the British. In all honesty, though many of the British soldiers we see are brutal louts, I don't see them behaving at all unbelievably for who they are, especially considering the situation (the film does kind of plop us down in the middle of the argument without giving us much context, it is true). Some of them aren't depicted this way, and most are depicted as faceless fodder. Which is exactly how the protagonists see them  or are supposed to see them, anyway  and that's what's most important. There certainly is sympathy for the British victims, as when, after a raid that leaves a couple dozen British dead, a few of the inexperienced IRA men can't stop staring at the corpses they've just created. ""Don't look at them. They'd have done the same to you,"" is the order that's barked at them. I'm glad I skipped it at the theater, though. I was worried about not being able to understand the dialect, and, sure enough, I had to use subtitles. Highly recommended."

","The Wind That Shakes The Barley- 2007, Directed by Ken Loach<br/><br/>It's probably best that the Cilian Murphy escaped infection ravaged England and came west to the rolling hills and emerald glens of his native land. The star of the Surprise hit ""28 Days Later"" choose wisely, avoiding the horror sequel and landing a strong staring role in The Wind that Shakes the Barely, the Winner of the Palme 'Or award at the 2007 Cannes film festival. It chronicles the lives of two young brothers and their growth into seasoned Irish Republican Army Veterans. The film opens with what is in reality a conclusion. The young men playing a form of field hockey in a flat patch of land beneath the craggy clifts and glens, which are to be the closing hours of their youth. The eldest brother Teddy (Padraic Delahney) has dug in his lot with the IRA, and has imerged a friery leader in the vein of a young Michael Collins. Damien (Cilian Murphy) is only days away from leaving his home for Medical school in London. Damien's boyish looks and gentile face disguise a steely and determined revolutionary. The English auxiliary force known as the Black and Tans ravage the house of a childhood friend, and alter the expected fates of both brothers. Every Irishman present is humiliated and forced to pronounce his name in perfect Queen's English, until a childhood friend Michael (Laurance Barry) refuses and is clubbed to death where he stands. At a crossroads, Damien re-affirms to his friends his future; in medicine. The title comes from a nationalist song of the same name by Robert Dwyer Joyce, "" And join the bold united men, while soft winds shake the Barley"". At his friends funeral this mournful ballad is sung by an older mourner. Damien departs for medical school. However fate won't let go of Damien as his heart is stirred again by an act of defiance. In the face of death the train driver refuses to transport British Soldiers and is badly beaten. Damien returns home to swear fidelity to the IRA. The film progresses through rigorous training, marching and builds a sense of Irish pride and patriotism among the community of men. As their leader Teddy suffers prison interrogation (think George Clooney in Syriana) his comrades in arms drown out his screams with homeland songs. Not long after a jailbreak, the IRA is strong enough to be taken seriously as political force. The Wind that Shakes the Barley could just as well be divided in half, as the Irish state soon will be as well. The War of Irish Independence soon gave way to the Irish Civil War which took twice as many lives. Here Teddy and Damien represent a divided nation. While they sought a full independent republic, they could negotiate only the Irish Free State. While the new state grants home rule on policing and economic policy and removes the British Army it also keeps Ireland officially under the crown and Britain fully retains Northern Ireland (Ulster). As the news is breaks across Ireland, soon former comrades are divided between pro-treaty and anti-treaty factions. Even in the pews of Catholic church, political friction abounds. It's often the representative of the old guard is the best position to negotiate and make the way towards sweeping change, and Teddy has grown from a bomb-thrower and fire-eater into a pragmatic politician. As Free State police captain now, he wants to build upon these gains at a later date. Damien remains the idealist, forsaking anything besides a full and united republic telling his brother to his face, ""your wrapped in the union jack, that's the butcher's apron"". Soon Damien and the Stalwarts come to see the pro-treaty Irish as a puppet extension of the British crown, at odds with Ireland's working classes. English socialist, Director Ken Loach who has chosen to shoot the characters together in the first half quickly delineates the two brothers separating their screen time as well as their political paths. Even the love of his future wife, Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald) at her feistiest cannot quell Damien's idealism or return the wild rover to his home. Damien must soon choose between the vision he has for a united Ireland or his life itself. There is a cruel irony in the two choices faced by the brothers. To fight on in a united, occupied Ireland still totally subject to the British, or work within a fractured country much more free yet rife with Irish fratricide. These ironies are not lost on the English director who wares his heart on his sleeve, making no apologies for the historical blood caked on his countryman's hands. Loach, teams up with screenwriter Paul Laverty in what is their deepest and most beautiful film together to date. Loach who directed the 1990 thriller Hidden Agenda takes an another look at the IRA. Yet with it's beautiful landscapes Barley has equal political resonance and is heartbreakingly beautiful to watch."

","I was beginning to wonder if this film was going to attract any distribution in the U.S. I guess the controversy in the U.K. didn't help matters any (the film was panned there). I've been a long time fan of the films of Ken Loach since I saw some of his work in the early 1980's. Loach has been a lightning rod for controversy for years now. 'The Wind That Shakes The Barley' (2006) will certainly cement Loach's rep for stirring up a tempest in a teapot. The plot concerns two brothers that starve for justice in 1920's Ireland,when the country was ruled with an iron hand by the British. It's a difficult film to watch at times (I won't say exactly why,so's not to ruin it for others), but well worth the occasional seat squirming to find out about a dark,sad tale of Irish social history). If you can find an art cinema that is screening this, run,don't walk to see it."
"andrabem","9","2","9","10 May 2007"," the answers are blowing in the wind
","""The wind that shakes the barley"" is a good and necessary film. Those that have a faint knowledge of the Irish War of Independence"" (followed soon after by a civil war) and the actions of the Black & Tans in Ireland, should see this film. Yes, I think that Ken Loach's films are necessary, especially today when the media bombard us daily with their conservative messages. <br/><br/>My personal problem with ""The wind that shakes the barley"" is that it delivers a ready-made message. Ken Loach doesn't hide his sympathy for the radical wing of the IRA (to which the film's more engaging characters belong). Mind you, I'm not against them, but was there any chance of success in a total war against Britain, when the radicals had so few weapons and resources? Remember Spain in the 30s! Anyway that's beside the point. <br/><br/>Now, take for instance ""La Battaglia di Algeri"" by Pontecorvo. This film succeeds in portraying the Algerian War of Independence in such a way that many questions still remain open after the end of the film. It's a film that makes us think. The answers are not so easy. ""La Battaglia di Algeri"" was filmed just some years after the Algerian War of Independence, used nonprofessional actors and was filmed in the streets - it has a feeling of urgency and it hasn't lost its strength. <br/><br/>On the other hand, ""The wind that shakes the barley"" was filmed in studio with professional actors and somehow looks like a period piece (a left wing one). It arouses the emotions of the viewer in the same way ""Dr. Jivago"" does. <br/><br/>I repeat again that I think that ""The wind that shakes the barley"" is an important and necessary film - it moved me too. My knowledge of the Irish War of Independence and the civil war that followed was enlarged. ""The wind that shakes the barley"" is a beautiful and heart-warming film. <br/><br/>The main drawback of the film is that it removes the need to think about what happened, the film does the thinking for us."

","Good old Ken Loach. This dedicated English socialist has made the most interesting film to come out of Ireland in recent years. He has managed to pack in a history lesson, a war movie, a love story and sibling rivalry into two hours. Good performances all round - Cillian Murphy's best to date. If you know nothing about the unraveling of the British Empire and the foundation of the Irish Free State, look no further. Streets ahead of the overblown Michael Collins, Loach's sparse, naturalistic style serves the bigger story well. Focusing on two brothers fighting the good fight against the Brits in Cork in the aftermath of the 1916 rebellion, the film is at its best as the battle hardens young minds. When the Brits eventually pull out, leaving chaos and bad feeling behind them, the tide turns and brother goes against brother. Credit to writer Paul Laverty for turning this pivotal period of Irish history into a gripping tale. High point the ending, low point no Brendan Gleeson."

"caitrionarose","Null","2","9","17 July 2006"," Unbiased and touching portrayal
","""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" is one of those films that will touch some while leaving others wondering what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>I had heard much talk about the criticism bestowed on the film by English critics - calling it anti-English and biased - but I must say I found it to be otherwise. I feel the reason the English critics were so harsh on the movie is because they simply could not identify with the subject matter, maybe not being so aware of their not-so-shiny history as they should have been before lashing out. This lack of connection is one thing that may keep international viewers from appreciating it in the same way as Irish viewers.<br/><br/>As someone who's family will have had a history on either or both sides of the the civil war of the 20s and/or the on-going troubles in the north, the movie will make you think of your own great-grandparents or grand-parents as being those young and initially vibrant people in the film whose worlds are torn apart by something they eventually must react against. Their inner struggles and heartbreaks were extremely well portrayed (although Orla Fitzgerald's performance was the one low-point of the movie, particularly her monologue following the announcement of the terms of the Treaty - it felt like the only truly unnatural and rehearsed piece of dialogue in the whole movie. Her performance as a whole was wooden and left Murphy with little to work with.) The real emphasis of the film stayed on the Irish men and women who partook in the fighting, against both the black-and-tans and their fellow Irishmen, really only showing the Black-and-tans when absolutely necessary, as the catalyst for the actions of the Irish. There was no indulgence in any biased portrayal of the English and to think so is not seeing the wood for the trees.<br/><br/>The unexpected success of the movie for me was not only in bringing home the plight of the Irish at the time, but leaving the audience to decide how they might have reacted themselves, or who they may have sided with - my companion and I left the cinema sitting on exactly opposite sides of the fence! Murphy's performance is excellent, the development of his character from a near coward to martyr was beautifully portrayed. Delaney's portrayal of Teddy was a little underwhelming I must say, but he gave excellent support to the main character. Cunningham was wonderful, giving an immaculate and very subtle performance letting his character get under your skin. As said above, Fitzgerald let the cast down with her blatantly poor, almost amateur performance."

","Steeped in controversy of its depictions of British brutality in Ireland 'The Wind that Shakes the Barley' is none the less a great film and certainly the best Ken Loach has done for a while. The backbone of the story is as old as words with two brother who start off on the same side and through various acts end up fighting each other, it is this that gives the film its raw emotion and coupled with the films violent set pieces and a love relationship you have an interesting mix. The movie opens in a very slow and calm way before suddenly becoming quite the opposite and through the mix of an amazing story and some great acting it is quite a ride and when I came out I almost felt like I'd been winded. Cillian Murphy is particularly good as the doctor on his way to London before being brought into the conflict and having to make some exceptionally tough decisions. The film which won this years Palme'Dor will probably divide audiences as it has critics but I do think that it is something you need to see and then make up your own mind.Itis certainly a thought-provoking look at this turbulent time in the 1920's and another lesson to be learnt from the history books."

And, obviously, the hate for the Englishmen (inconvenient, as I am living in Reading for two moths more). I am (shamefully) at my first Ken Loach movie, but I have the sensation of a great discover. A direction that may appear dry and detached, maybe because far away from the eccentric ones I'm used to, but detains actually the sober and precious role of the storyteller. For the ones that usually don't appreciate the kind, no worries: you are going to love this anyhow. The screenplay is a masterpiece itself, without dead zones, air pockets or forced dialogue.

","The Wind That Shakes The Barley doesn't break conventions, and is the primary reason the film fails to succeed. Throughout the two hours of runtime, it stays on the safe route, never deviating, never tries to be extraordinary. Most veteran film-goers will find this a different type of the same. Apart from a few who may rate it highly, The Wind That Shakes The Barley is not a cause for celebration. It moves at snail-pace, monotonous, and rarely excites or titillates. The screenplay is dull, working better as a sleeping pill than a narrative medium. It discusses themes like loyalty, war, and discrimination in a way that isn't appealing.<br/><br/>The cast is mostly unknown, which means there won't be any star distraction. But what's distracting is the sub-par acting. For an independent film, The Wind That Shakes The Barley bucks the trend of having strong and well casted roles. If there's a positive light to the film, it will be the cinematography. Shots of vast grasslands, and beautiful greenery literally give the film a brighter outlook. Occasionally, the photography helps to relieve the poor viewing experience, but it is just unable to shoulder the immense liability as a result of average film construction.<br/><br/>The Wind That Shakes The Barley is a weak war drama, a pale comparison to similar films like Terrence Mallick's The Thin Red Line. The battle sequences are limited, however the opportunity to present dramatic value is wasted due to an imperfect screenplay, which I believe is the root of the problem here.

","WARNING SPOILERS!<br/><br/>The courage and resilience of the Irish during the War for Independence against Great Britain is depicted better here than in any other film I've seen about the IRA.<br/><br/>Constantly subjected to acts of terrorism and humiliation from the Tans, a group of men from Cork have had all they can stand and join the campaign to get British tyranny out of Ireland for good. Among this group of guerilla soldiers is Teddy O'Donnovan (Padraic Delaney is an actor to watch for!) and his younger brother Damien (Cillian Murphy), who is planning to finish his medical training in London. Reluctant to get involved at first, Damien sees one of his best friends brutally murdered for no reason at all by the Tans. The constant cruelty by people who abuse their power changes his position.<br/><br/>The film is about the unpleasant demands and duties facing these soldiers, and about the very high price of freedom. There comes a time when it seems freedom is accomplished, but there are conditions that must be met and a treaty that must be signed. It's hard to know who to side with. Teddy and those who think like him want the bloodshed to end, and he's convinced that a completely independent Ireland is just not possible when the British Empire has so much power. Damien, his friend Dan (Liam Cunningham), and others feel that this treaty is a slap in the face to those who have given their lives and suffered. Damien and Dan see that if they don't continue the battle to rid Ireland of all British dominion, the same suffering will go on and on, and their comrades will have died for nothing. Civil war breaks out among the Irish, pitting friends (and brothers) against each other, and the results are excruciatingly tragic.<br/><br/>The film draws your emotions in as you watch the injustice, the ruthless physical and mental tortures, the difficult and terrible reality that in war, you follow orders. The execution of Damien's friend Chris Reilly (John Crean) is one of many very disturbing scenes, so be warned. <br/><br/>I very much appreciated the role of the women in this film. The characters of Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald), Peggy and Bernadette were well developed and integral to the plot.

","THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY is about on-par in the UK as the troubles the US has accepting its treatment of Native Americans. Mother England has calloused hands, and it's not all from hard work; some of it is from taking up arms against neighbors and suppressing democracy in favor of holding a death-grip on the finances of other countries. Which brings us to the formation of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) and this film's point.<br/><br/>Anyone with a working knowledge of history knows that northern and southern Ireland aren't exactly peaceful toward one another. And it isn't just about religion. Dating back to the 1920s and beyond, England flexed her mighty muscle over the Irish in order to keep a tight hold on its foreign provinces. The ""emerald island"" suffered incredible oppression and financial destitution at the hands of UK law and its enforcing military. This divided Ireland and its inhabitants on multiple levels. Peace versus non-oppression. Catholic versus Protestant. The rich versus the poor. It is an incredibly complex situation.<br/><br/>What this film does it put the perspective entirely on the IRA and why they became a force to be reckoned with. The story it surrounds is basically a microcosmic study which focuses on Damien (Cillian Murphy, BREAKFAST ON PLUTO), a student off to medical school but pulled up short by the atrocities he witnesses from English troops on Irish men, women, and children.<br/><br/>Damien's brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) is already an IRA member when the film begins, and Damien's transition into their ranks is easily done. Teddy is a higher-up in the IRA and Damien is seen as second-in-command. The difficulties Damien has in turning from healing doctor-to-be, to that of a war-hardened killer are excellently filmed. The love between Damien and his brother is fraught with peril as the two eventually find themselves on opposite sides after the ratification of a peace treaty. Damien's descent into questionable morals (enabled by his brother) are handled very well by director Ken Loach who has an eye for panoramic vistas littered with fields of barley.<br/><br/>The barley is important to the film if a bit too obscure for most watchers. The title implies a 19th century poem by Robert D. Joyce in which young men fighting for Irish independence in 1798 would carry barley strands in their pockets. When they were killed, their bodies were buried and from there a barley patch would later emerge. With all of the barley sprouts visible around Ireland, there's little doubt how many young men died.<br/><br/>Although pretty lopsided as far as historical recountings go, the story of a young man's dedication to his country, his brother, and his own damaged morality are something rarely seen in a short 127 minute film. Most of the time it would take years of filming documentary material to get this sense across to an audience. But The Wind That Shakes The Barley really does shake up the watcher. Let us just hope that no more pockets need be filled with grain again."

","I'm very glad I watched this film. A little high-brow for me, I thought but no, it was engrossing from beginning to end. The story unfolded really well and it didn't pull any punches along the way. What I really liked was the way the dialogue was delivered so 'naturally'. It was really noticeable that the actors 'fluffed' their lines on more than one occasion and in any other film, these scenes would have been re-shot but these faux pas were left in and the film is all the better for it. I've never seen that done in any other film. It makes it true to life. How many of us speak eloquently 100% of the time, getting every sentence uttered in a word-perfect fashion? None of us, so why do they do this in films? It makes me look at films I've watched since in a different way, thinking much more about how many takes a particularly tricky piece of dialogue took to get right. Good stuff!"
"Polaris_DiB","8","1","5","1 May 2007"," Freedom, peace, conflict, violence, politics, love
","""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" is the latest Ken Loach film which analyzes the Irish War for Independence through the eyes of a young doctor and his brother, both who join the Irish Republican Army in order to fight for freedom and peace, but who eventually split ideologies to represent the conflict over what such things as freedom, peace, conflict, violence, politics, and love mean to society. Such concepts are in the air right now, but Loach seems to be sincerely inquisitive about them.<br/><br/>This movie can easily be broken down into three parts. The first act uses violence and tension to create the exposition. The second act goes directly into the politics and dialog of the time. The third represents martyrdom and familial split. Of these parts, the third is the weakest, though but for the acting, which remains strong throughout. Cillian Murphy is a fantastic character actor who's gradually making himself known, and he's backed up by a stunning cast that doesn't do wrong.<br/><br/>Loach also takes great pleasure in filming the countryside and the beauty that these characters live in. In many films such as these the idea is to show via the land what these characters are truly fighting for, and in this film it's particularly effective, also relating itself to the title (which is from a poem recited early in the film). A particularly ingenious use of landscape involves Damien and Sinead walking leisurely out of a heart-shaped copse that foreshadows their later relationship. Use of a love-interest in this case isn't maudlin, but done in a nicely understated way.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","A very powerful Movie in typical Ken Loach's uncompromising style, in which again he attempts to expose past injustices in History and Modern Life, as he sees them. Again Writer Paul Laverty has served Loach well, and no doubt they will once again have, between them, annoyed and dismayed the ""Establishment"". Well worth seeing, although harrowing in places, to give a perspective to the Irish/English historical situation. The acting, almost without exception, by a largely unknown cast was excellent and believably realistic. One aspect of the film which I feel needs some explanation is in depicting the ""Black and Tans"", the irregulars, where they almost all spoke with Scottish accents. This reflects how mainly Scots were recruited for these duties,dressed in makeshift uniforms, allowing the regular army to keep a distance. I wish Ken Loach could be given the power of a large budget and the freedom to cover any subject, but I doubt that will ever happen because of his uncompromising nature with the truth."

","There are good entertaining films which you see, enjoy during the show and forget about it as soon as you leave the theater or switch off the TV. But there are films after the end you still munch over it and think a lot of relevant and irrelevant matters on the film. This film THE WIND THAT SHAKES THE BARLEY, which got the PALME D'OR award, is such a film which disturbs your mind and make you think about wars, revolutions etc. Somebody said ""The revolution eats its own children"". What Man envisages and follows a course it leads to unexpected results. Every revolution gets distorted in its later stages which turn comrades and brothers into enemies. The French revolution had its own terror after the revolution ""succeeded"". The French revolution did not succeed and the bourbons came back. The same is with Irish revolution which this film portrays. The same is with the Russian Revolution. That is why I think to some extent Gandhi's revolution avoided these pitfalls of an armed revolution. There was no terror after the revolution even though Gandhi himself was killed, not by his colleagues. I even try to visualize what would be the state of India if Subash Chandra Bose succeeded in his invasion of India for freedom with the help of Japanese. There is no doubt that Bose was a great patriot but was he right in his tactics. Had he succeeded first I wonder how he would have tackled the Japanese control – with another war? Again how he would have tackled his own colleagues who may differ from him in his policies and actions. With the arms and ammunition which are available in the country after the invasion would it have bring about a civil war? Would Bose have killed Gandhi and Nehru, of course with remorse like Teddy when he himself orders shooting of Damien or without remorse by LTTE leader Prabahakaran.<br/><br/>The very fact that such thoughts were going through my mind even after many hours is clear testament to the greatness of this film. Of course the brutality of both the British soldiers and the revolutionaries are stark and disturbing. The screen play is tight and direction is wonderful."
"Hollywood_Yoda","9","1","6","11 June 2008"," A Civil War after Years of Foreign Occupation: Sound Familiar?
","When I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think of the way the Irish treated each other during the Civil War in the early twentieth century. It reminded me as well about the tensions and mistreatments of our own American Civil War soldiers just a mere sixty years before the events in this film take place. What can we learn of war, but to be soldiers, not ever knowing peace? A future so gleam, it seemed as though the Irish Civil War would never end once it began. It was the Protestants against the Catholics, the British supporters against those who were severely oppressed by the British. It was what some had seen as the war to reunite the Irish people as a whole, but none the less, it did the opposite.<br/><br/>In the current American invasion of Iraq, almost every day anymore, we see mistreatment in warfare to soldiers, ones of our own, and those of the enemy. In warfare, there are rules to engagement, and there is to be no mistreatment of soldiers of any side, even in an occupied country. But just as it is today, the past was just as cruel. The British soldiers in the film were merely beating the Irish into submission, making them see things their way, almost like American forces in Iraq are doing now.<br/><br/>Another reason that warfare is not pleasant is to those who suffer watching others profiteer from the violence. Sometimes from security issues, for example, the Blackwater incident in Iraq in 2006, where security personnel were receiving kickbacks on safety contracts, which left American soldiers unsafe. War profiteering is not at all new, and every American President has gained some notoriety from his war campaigns. The current war in Iraq for example, the Halliburton Company is profiteering, which was formerly headed up as CEO by current United States Vice President, Dick Cheney.<br/><br/>In the film, the rebel soldiers were doing business with a shady character that financed the war, but at the same time, evicted women and their children. These groups of rebels were highly ridiculed for their actions, as they maybe should have been. But at the same time, I can see their side of the story as well. This man was powerful, and had the money to finance the war they were hoping would turn their country in the right direction. It was a plain ethical dilemma, but if not made, could have resulted in the end of their uprising.<br/><br/>There is one other ethical dilemma that causes concern for me, and that is the fact that the soldiers had to dispose of their own. It was awful, tying one of them to a post and shooting him for keeping information needed to keep the war going. And another one of their own was shot along with a corrupt boss for being sympathetic to the enemy. If it were me, and I was the one to make the call, I know it would be hard for me to do, as it was for the main characters in the film."
"dead47548","9","1","6","9 January 2008"," A remarkable study on what divides a nation and a family.
","This film is really split into two separate films. One is a grand story of war; how one can easily get swept up into it and can never escape, how it can change drastically people and how it can tear the closest relationships apart. The other is a hard-hitting political drama, filled with intense courtroom arguments and even more engaging debates among the community (in this case, among the leaders of the IRA). The story of war is utterly heartbreaking. We see Damien become quickly engaged as a leader of a war that he never wanted to be involved in, and the toll this war takes on him throughout his life.<br/><br/>We slowly realize that the war will never end; there will just be more and more killings, and those who are involved can never escape it. Even after the IRA receives everything they have asked for, after many debates of whether to compromise or not, some members are still unsatisfied and paranoid and they revolt setting off another war between fellow Irishmen. This is where we see the tearing of one of the strongest relationships known to man. Two loving brothers, who meant the world to each other at the beginning, are ripped apart onto opposite sides of this civil war. The parallel between Damien and Teddy's relationship from the beginning of the film to the end of the film is utterly fascinating. At the beginning we see them in a prison together, ready to be executed by each other's side. Damien says that his name is Teddy's so that they will torture him instead of Teddy, though the farce doesn't work.<br/><br/>At the end, we see Damien sitting in the same prison cell. The amazement of this is that Teddy is the one running the prison this time around, and it's Damien who is to be executed. The finale is one of the most gutwrenching and utterly heartbreaking scenes of cinematic history for me. I could barely stand to watch, and tears quickly rose to my eyes. Overall this is a phenomenal film, and easily one of the best of 2006. Cillian Murphy delivers a phenomenal performance that ranks among the best of the year. Padraic Delaney and Liam Cunningham also give quite the exceptional work. I should also mention the gorgeous cinematography which does a phenomenal job of setting the scene for this heartbreaking and vastly engaging political war drama."
"evanston_dad","8","1","6","3 January 2008"," A Naturalistic Account of the IRA
","This fascinating film about the Irish Republican Army in 1920s Ireland has an improvisatory feel about it. Not many scenes in the movie feel scripted. There are many scenes showing groups of men and women arguing, debating and fighting, but it all feels natural, and like the way these kinds of moments would play out in real life. Indeed, thinking back on the movie, it seems like much of it took place without dialogue, or at least without significant dialogue. This may be an odd comparison, but it reminded me of Michael Cimino's style of film-making in ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Heaven's Gate"": the emphasis on male solidarity up against forces too strong to oppose, the environment almost becoming a character in the film, the loosely choreographed scenes and the fact that much information is conveyed through imagery rather than words.<br/><br/>The nominal focus of the film is on two brothers who start out on the same side of the Irish/British conflict, but who become opposed to one another as the IRA fragments into conflicting factions. The brother against brother plot line is of course meant to symbolize a larger and more universal struggle, but it's not dealt with in a heavy-handed manner.<br/><br/>A very good and overlooked film.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","As the filmed opened I was stunned with those West Cork Hills. My Grandfather was from Ballyvourney and much of the film was shot in the Ballyvourney-Ballingeary area, as far as I know and what the closing credits suggest. My comments won't be to re-cap the film(plenty of good ones here) but to just, I guess, vent. As an American descendant of Corkonians from San Francisco I quite literally grew up with those who are genetically and geographically tied with those portrayed in TWTSTB. For heavens sake my great uncle Jer founded San Francisco's first hurling league, the Rebel Corkers in 1928. Enough of the bona-fides... Listen, I love Loaches' work and generally loved the film for the same reasons of most of the others that have responded here. I sympathize, however , with those who found the depiction of the mercenaries as being one dimensional. If not for historical realities, at least for dramatic ones, I would have liked to see what drove probably good people in any other circumstances , ex-cons or not, to murder for the Crown. Lord knows I'm seeing some of my own countrymen coming back from Iraq with much of the films content on their shoulders. I saw that beautifully portrayed in those involved with the Flying Columns but missed it with their adversaries. Maybe that was Loaches point, to give the Cork view of things from that time. Fair enough, but still. As far as you U.K. viewers go I walked out of that film thinking more about the futility of people shooting at one another than anything else. As a quote in the film said, ""I hope this IRL. we're fighting for is worth it"". On a lighter side, I guess, the court scene was great. Those were some of the Irish women I grew up with. Thanks be to God. Anyhow see the film. My views are more for those of you that did. E-mail me back, esp. if you're from the U.K or IRL. Peace, Richard @ crowerh@gmail.com"
"colin-cooper","9","1","6","16 February 2007"," Loach's ability to sweep you up in his action, movement and drama has never been so marked.
","The critics who condemn this movie for its IRA sympathies are missing the point. Loach shows you the IRA in its early days, when its sole purpose was to fight the armed and uniformed occupiers of their land. They owed the English nothing. The English had treated the Irish with little but brutality for centuries, and the appearance in 1920 of a new but still brutal military force, the Black and Tans, was too much. Every decent young Irishman sympathised with the movement to fight them. It was only later that the IRA turned to terrorism against civilians, using bombs to kill the innocent along with the guilty. Understand that, and you will not fall into the trap of labelling the film 'anti-British'. <br/><br/>The film has been called 'one-sided'. Of course it is. It's not the function of a work of art to present a balanced argument. Was Picasso's Guernica a balanced argument? If in addition to the horror of the bombing it had presented the point of view of General Franco, who was fighting what he believed to be the threat of communism, Picasso's masterpiece would have been laughed at. The Wind That Shakes the Barley deserves to be treated as art."

","Another impressive film from ken Loach. It's an excellent account of British - Irish conflict, very clear and the complex situation is described capturing both tension and anger. As usual the director gives the viewer powerful emotions and gripping moments. Plus this time, like in ""Land and Freedom"" the film falls on human drama, after starting by telling historical-political facts. Cillian Murhy is perfect in his central role but the other actors as well give excellent performances.

"Terrell-4","9","1","7","3 February 2008"," A brutal, sad, powerful film of the Irish rebellion against the British, and the civil war that followed
","Ireland in the early Twenties exploded into armed rebellion against the British. Two brothers at first made opposite decisions. A group of Black and Tan British soldiers arrive at a farm where the brothers and a group of other young men are resting after a field hockey game. The British terrorize everyone there, the men, the women, the aged and the young. They beat and kill one man for refusing to give his name in English. When they roar off, one brother, Teddy (Padraic Delaney), immediately helps form the men into armed resistors. Damien (Cillian Murphy), a medical student, decides to go on to London to a prestigious medical school where he is enrolled to finish his studies. At the train station he witnesses another group of soldiers attack and beat the train's conductor and engineer. The attacks are filled with screams and rifle butts. Damien returns to the village and joins the armed resistors. <br/><br/>From then on we're in the middle of a rag-tag guerilla war, driven by a stern sense of justice and a determination to force the British out of Ireland. The British use wide-spread intimidation, brutality, imprisonment and executions by courts martial. Some of the men we've met die, British soldiers die, hostages die, traitors die, a young friend of Damien's who gave information is executed by Damien. He slowly moves from a reluctant fighter to a man who has become single-minded in what he does. When a truce is declared and a peace treaty is finally agreed upon in 1922 between the British Government and Sinn Fein, the stark reality of compromise splits the fighters. On the one hand, there will be an Irish Free State with British troops withdrawn. On the other hand, it will be a member of the British Commonwealth, an oath of allegiance to the British crown will be required and Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of Britain. Is this what we fought for...to give allegiance to the British, many ask? What we fought for was independence and in most regards we have it, say others. Ireland must be whole, say some. If we don't agree the British will flood the island with their troops, say others. We watch a civil war begin, with Irishmen taking up arms and killing each other. For the brothers, who once fought the British together, it means a crucial split. One fights to put down the rebellion against the newly independent Irish state, the other vows to fight until all Ireland is completely free. <br/><br/>One critic of the film said that ""there isn't much nuance to either side."" That's probably because, nurtured by terrible actions and long memories, there wasn't much nuance in real life. The Wind That Shapes the Barley is a sad, powerful and emotional film. It doesn't shy away from the brutality and torture by British soldiers or the ruthlessness of the armed response. Most of all, we come face to face with both the courage and the grime needed by the Irish to finally, after centuries of ruthless, condescending oppression, rid most of the island of the British. The acting is uniformly persuasive, especially by Murphy and Delaney as the two brothers. Cillian Murphy, in particular gives a subtle and mesmerizing performance. The brothers' fate may not be tragic but it is so sad it makes you reflect on what you've seen. That's not a bad thing. Each brother in his own way pays for the choices he makes.<br/><br/>And the title? It's from a 19th Century poem that tells of a young Irish boy who soon will leave his sweetheart to join others fighting the English in the 1798 rebellion. They would carry barley in their pockets as provisions on the march. When they were slain and their bodies pitched into unmarked mass graves by the English, from their bodies the sprouting barley came to symbolise that Irish resistance to the British would never die. <br/><br/>I sat within the valley green, I sat me with my true love <br/><br/>My sad heart strove the two between, the old love and the new love <br/><br/>The old for her, the new that made me think on Ireland dearly <br/><br/>While soft the wind blew down the glen and shook the golden barley <br/><br/>'Twas hard the woeful words to frame to break the ties that bound us <br/><br/>But harder still to bear the shame of foreign chains around us <br/><br/>And so I said, ""The mountain glen I'll seek at morning early <br/><br/>And join the bold united men,"" while soft winds shake the barley<br/><br/>While sad I kissed away her tears, my fond arms round her flinging<br/><br/>A yeoman's shot burst on our ears from out the wildwood ringing<br/><br/>A bullet pierced my true love's side in life's young spring so early <br/><br/>And on my breast in blood she died while soft winds shook the barley <br/><br/>I bore her to some mountain stream, and many's the summer blossom <br/><br/>I placed with branches soft and green about her gore-stained bosom<br/><br/>I wept and kissed her clay-cold corpse then rushed o'er vale and valley <br/><br/>My vengeance on the foe to wreak while soft wind shook the barley <br/><br/>But blood for blood without remorse I've taken at Oulart Hollow <br/><br/>And laid my true love's clay cold corpse where I full soon may follow <br/><br/>As round her grave I wander drear, noon, night and morning early <br/><br/>With breaking heart when e'er I hear the wind that shakes the barley."

","The Wind That Shakes the Barley is historically accurate, and sums up the the Irish War of Independence in a way that I believe could not be achieved again.<br/><br/>The story follows Damien (Cillian Murphy), an Irishman who has his sights set on leaving the country and beginning a long career in medicine. His dream however turns astray when he decides to stay and fight the horrible injustice that British are inflicting on their country. Damien along with his brother and the rest of the IRA, begin their long, and very argues battle against the British Empire. They however are always fighting a losing battle, and with the edge of inevitability always looming above them, their battle is all the more powerful.<br/><br/>I've read reviews with people saying that the depiction of the British Soldiers was overblown and contrived. This I cannot argue or defend, but rather I can say that regardless of how severe they were, the injustice that was inflicted upon Ireland did happen, and is a part of history. Therefore not knowing any more, I simply believed what was put before and I chose to trust Ken Loach's depiction of the horrific events. Doing this I found I not only gained a much greater understanding and respect for those involved, but it also enhanced the impact that the film delivered. Moments of this film are crafted and put together wonderfully. It's not fake and Hollywood, this is history film making at it's finest. This film does not glorify the IRA but rather shows the brave and courageous men and woman who were alive during this time, it shows heart wrenching decisions with realism, it accentuates the human mind and it's ability too understand the difference of right from wrong, and ultimately this film demands an answer too why and how such an event occurred.<br/><br/>The Wind That Shakes the Barley is not easy to watch, some scenes in particular I imagine will make some turn away. However as I said it's real and it's history and as of such The Wind That Shakes the Barley deserves all the credit that it receives and merits watching for any who wish to enjoy a powerful and moving movie experience."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","7","10 September 2007"," This Palme D'or winner is not necessarily biased if the audience can think independently
","A good film draws the audience into it in such a way that starting as a detached bystander, they gradually become part of it. A very good film can do this even when the audience starts out knowing very little about the background and the issues. Ken Loach's 2006 Cannes Palme D'or winner ""The wind that shakes the barley"" is just such a film. <br/><br/>I know no more about the IRA than an average global citizen who pays an average amount of attention following global news does, and still less about its history in the early 20th century. But despite struggling a little during the first 15 minutes with the difficult Irish accent, I was soon fully absorbed in the film. Unlike Brad Pitt in the Hollywood melodrama The Devil's Own (1997), Cillian Murphy's character is humanly realistic under Ken Loach's no-nonsense, brutally effective direction of a straightforward IRA story.<br/><br/>The repeated, escalating actions of senseless violence and atrocity during the first half of the film have a reason for being shown. As you will see during the later part, these establishing scenes help the audience to appreciate the subsequent actions of the characters. Quite a few comments suggest that the film slants towards the Republican's point of view. To those who have seen the film, this verdict is all too obvious. But then it will be a problem only to those in the audience who lack the capacity to think, assess and judge independently. While showing mostly the atrocities of the British (especially the sadistic military ""Black and Tans"") will likely gain some (deserved) sympathy for the IRA, it will not make the audience forget their senseless terrorism victimizing so many innocent people, just as watching ""Paradise now"" will not make you forget the innocent victims of Palestinian terrorism. <br/><br/>Telling of the story of the two brothers in ""The wind that shakes the barley"", however, does make you understand more. Leading a cast of talented Irish actors not generally known to the global movie audience, Cillian Murphy demonstrates once again his versatility, particular if his most recent movie you have watched in ""Breakfast on Pluto"", as is in my case. The Emerald Isle under Barry Ackroyd's superb cinematography is mesmerizing."

","The British did some appalling things in Ireland. Well, let's be honest, the British did appalling things on every continent of the globe, but they seemed to reserve a particular wrath for the Irish, whom they treated with a nasty brutality normally reserved for the inhabitants of far hotter, more distant lands.<br/><br/>This is a truly depressing movie, but beautifully filmed. I made a mistake watching it on a Friday night. I should have reserved it for a wet Monday. As someone born and raised in Britain, but with an Irish father, I came out of the cinema not sure if I should feel guilty at being a Brit or proud to be Irish. It's a conflicted feeling, appropriate for a movie about two conflicted protagonists.<br/><br/>Damian (Cillian Murphy) is a clever lad, a newly qualified doctor who wants nothing more than to be a healer. As the movie opens he is about to travel to London to take up a post at a major teaching hospital, a great opportunity for him personally. His brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) is a budding leader of the Irish Republican movement, trying to get rid of the British in general and the dreaded Black and Tans army unit in particular. It's 1920 and Ireland is poor and under the heel of Britain. Before he can leave, Damian witnesses two acts of utter brutality on the part of the occupying British army, and decides to throw in his lot with his brother and the band of insurgents  or freedom fighters, depending on which side of the Irish Sea you were living at the time.<br/><br/>But nothing is ever simple. Rarely is a war about simple freedom resolved simply, with everyone living happily ever after. The self governing Irish Republic has been voted in by the Irish people, but is not recognized by the ruling Brits and has been forced underground. The insurgent army, a determined and disciplined collection of local men from the countryside, is supported by the poor, rural population, and hands out swift and fierce punishment to anyone seen as a traitor to the Irish cause. Their guerrilla campaign wins a partial victory for the Irish, a treaty with the British which allows a degree of self government but still acknowledges the rule of the British crown. Teddy, a pragmatist, supports this limited victory, but Damian, an idealist, wants to keep fighting all out, for total victory and complete freedom for Ireland. The brothers find themselves on opposing sides, and the scene is set for tragedy. And the British can sit back cynically, and watch as the Irish fight each other instead.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is terrific in this movie. He was good in Breakfast on Pluto, although I found that movie vaguely disappointing, and he was chillingly good in Red Eye as a very nasty baddie. I'd go so far as to say he made Red Eye the surprisingly excellent thriller it was. I had been trying to think who he reminded me of, when a local film critic dropped the name Terence Stamp into his review of The Wind, and I found myself nodding in agreement. They both possess faces of angular beauty, all chiseled planes and haunting blue eyes. Here Murphy acts with an engaging air of honest vulnerability and is utterly compelling. The supporting cast is terrific, and the location shooting in County Cork shows the Ireland I remember from childhood holidays in the 50s and 60s, beautiful, windswept and poor. Thank goodness things have improved now, and Ireland has prospered in the European Union. Director Ken Loach and writer Paul Laverty are to be congratulated on an excellent movie."

Todays population remember the IRA of the 70's, 80's and early 90's as the criminalised murderers they undoubtedly became, but this film deals with the emergence of a guerilla army committed to ridding their soil of a foreign occupying power. US. The British!! The people who could have remembered such a time are long dead, and I think it is very important that we are reminded by such great films as this, of a time when we had just finished 'the war to end all wars', and many of the men who had survived the appalling carnage in France were suddenly posted to Ireland, where they continued to vent many of their prejudices and frustrations on an undeserving populus. The acting is stupendous. The realistic way in which many of the scenes are portrayed and dialogue delivered REALLY makes you feel like an observer rather than a viewer. The ugly brutality with which we tried to subjugate the Irish is more than enough reason for the physical backlash, and the arms length political machinations going on in the background are more than reminiscent of todays governments handling of the events in the Middle East. Absolutely fantastic. I WILL be forcing one of my bigoted friends to sit and watch it in the earnest hope that a little light is shed onto a subject which, in our lifetimes, became more criminal than political, and in doing so might give him a bit of perspective."
"wisewebwoman","8","1","7","18 March 2007"," Relentless and exhausting
","An extraordinary film, this brings the times of the Black & Tans and the ensuing civil war in Ireland (""The Troubles"") to the screen in a fierce and credible movie.<br/><br/>My family, in the past, were very much effected by the Black & Tans and stories were passed down of the atrocities they committed. Many of them were released from jail in England on condition they serve in this brutal force and they gladly availed themselves of the chance at freedom, with very little oversight into how they conducted themselves amongst the downtrodden and impoverished citizens of Ireland during that time. Ken Loach, along with his writer, Paul Laverty, do an admirable job of bringing this complexity to the screen.<br/><br/>It also struck me that this was the right time to do it - on a few levels, most notably that Ireland has been, economically, hugely successful, with the past, for the most part now forgotten, and for another in light of the civil war following the invasion and oppression of Iraq. Cruelty begets cruelty.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is amazing in his role of the young doctor Damien with Padraic Delaney playing his brother. But all the other bit parts excel, I've rarely seen such a cast of terrific and believable actors.<br/><br/>The mood of the era is captured beautifully, mainly filmed in the wilds of West Cork and evoking the fragile times of that era when whole families were torn apart when The Treaty was signed - some wanting to continue the fight for full autonomy, others wanting to cease the battle and grab at the chance for peace. <br/><br/>This was carefully crafted by all concerned, some of the dialogue would need subtitles, though I had no difficulty, and some of the scenes are gut wrenching in their realism. <br/><br/>8 out of 10."

"nikko_brien","8","1","7","28 February 2007"," A strong film but probably tempered by political considerations.
","Spent a fair bit of my childhood in the part of Ireland this film was set - so I remember the rugged countryside very well. I nearly broke my leg once when I got my foot stuck in a rabbit burrow, so I can understand why there was a three legged dog wandering about! As for the Black and Tans, they had been and gone long before I was born, but going by the memories of various aged relatives, I would say that the Wind That Shakes The Barley is a fairly gentle depiction of the violence that the mercenary soldiers inflicted on vulnerable Irish people. Although Sinead probably lost chunks of her scalp when her hair was hacked off and Teddy was tortured, I didn't notice people being nailed to trees which was one of the many heinous pastimes that the Black and Tans indulged in. All the same it was a strong and impressive film - far better than Michael Collins and probably closer to the truth."
"greyhound_skirt","9","1","7","26 February 2007"," Evocative, human, emotional and thought provoking
","Much of what I'll write has probably already been written, but I'd like to add my own ha'pen'orth.<br/><br/>I've just watched this film here in Dortmund, in a deserted cinema and I was quite taken aback. As a graduated film student I'm quite familiar with Loach, and this piece has many of the hallmarks associated with his work.<br/><br/>I found this film both moving and touching. I don't want to get into the politics, but ultimately, as a man, I believe it has far reaching consequences.<br/><br/>It reaches inside you and grabs you in a place you maybe didn't even know you had, playing with emotions that you may have never felt before - especially not while watching a film.<br/><br/>Yes the 'Black and Tans' are depicted as scum, and they undoubtedly were populated by disenfranchised ex-soldiers/mercenaries, hardened veterans of the Marne and the Somme; Anyone who disputes this should pay heed to the (original) 'Bloody Sunday' massacre at Croke Park in 1920.<br/><br/>But this is not the issue here. This film is not really about Britain or Ireland - although this may sound daft as that's where it's set. It's about people; It's about being human; It's about suffering; It's about fighting; It's about being a man. Ultimately it's about standing up to what you believe in and not folding, not collapsing under pressure.<br/><br/>It asks questions about how far you can take something before you end up behaving in the same way as the very same people you seek to repulse and defeat. It asks questions about who is right and who is wrong.<br/><br/>Personally, I believe that the film is asking the viewer questions about themselves and about what they would do. About how they would react in such a situation.<br/><br/>It doesn't seek to judge Teddy any more than it does Damien. Neither were evil men and both were fighting for what they believed in.<br/><br/>It shows the viewer that the 'occupying' British were evil - but you're allowed to hate them as they are a foreign force, in a country which, we are constantly reminded, they don't belong. But what happens when the enemy is/becomes your fellow countrymen, your friends, your former allies, your family - not some faceless foreigner. People that you grew up with, and whose table you sat round as a child, and now you're shooting at them when you all just want what's best for your country.<br/><br/>Yes, this film does have scenes highly reminiscent of 'Land and Freedom', both in the courtroom and near the end, where people who are 'on the same side' bicker with one another about the best approach to take regarding the treatment of certain people.<br/><br/>This, I believe, just serves to illustrate that the line between what is right, what is wrong, and what is achievable is a very fuzzy one, and that usually in life it's very difficult to get exactly what we want and that we either have to make compromises, or go down fighting, but that, ultimately, everybody loses something.<br/><br/>I implore anyone with a strong enough heart (and stomach) to go and see this film. Watch it and think. You'll be glad that you did."
"Seanofdbush","9","1","7","24 November 2006"," Beautifully filmed but...
","I liked this film a lot. As a movie it was quite good; as a history lesson, it was very interesting. And I thought Cillian Murphy was excellent in the lead role.<br/><br/>Visually, I thought it was stunning and the story, for most people living in Ireland, is pretty well known. I was born in an era when my grandparents were able to pass on their first-hand experiences of what is was like to have lived in the times of the ""Black 'n Tans"". And, despite what some British viewers might like to think, the film seems like a reasonably accurate portrayal of the time, if one believes what people who lived through it say. If it's possibly a bit too one-dimensional in its depiction of the 'Tans, I think that's because that was very much the predominant dimension for Irish people.<br/><br/>However, while I enjoyed the movie, there was something missing in that I didn't really see or become engaged in the process of why one would come down strongly on one side or the other in the civil was that followed the War of Independence. I know this from my history lessons, but I don't think the movie really addresses that issue very well. I do think that it's a worthwhile film to watch, especially for anyone interested in gaining a better understanding of the background to the troubles that have blighted Ireland for many years.<br/><br/>Sean."
"manschelde-1","8","1","7","17 September 2006"," challenging , gut wrenching, dark, powerful
","This is a very dark (both physically and mentally) movie, a challenge to watch , over two hours, and still very powerful. It made me cry, twice, and I left the cinema with a a lump in my throat.<br/><br/>It is surely not possible to make a movie about this ugly time in Irish history, without the movie itself being ""a terrible beauty"". You cannot make a story like this into something pretty or digestible. Wars of independence and Civil wars are indescribably ugly.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie was uneven.<br/><br/>Some of the accents are very strong and difficult to follow, which might inhibit some viewers. Sometimes when characters use native Gaelic, the subtitles do not explain what they say.<br/><br/>I thought that the movie showed as much brutality on either side. So I disagree with the overwhelming negativism of the British media about this movie. Probably their attention span cannot reach two hours.<br/><br/>Interesting that the movie covered such non military topics as fledgling 'court case' (with the position of women), the Irish separation issue in the context of the British Empire, the closeness of the cultures, and the economic debates of the protagonists.<br/><br/>Disappointing that the movie did not mention the hundreds of thousands of Irishmen (from the now republic) who fought for Britain in the 1914-1918 war, which itself shaped the views of many towards the treaty.<br/><br/>Acting was OK, but no standout performances for me, despite the two powerful scenes that were gut wrenching and wretched: the shooting of the young traitor, and the firing-squad scene.<br/><br/>Overall, very worthwhile and memorable."
"ersbel","Null","1","8","11 February 2010"," As strong as ""In the Name of the Father"" and more subtle
","I have to confess, I was skeptic about the quality of this movie. So much publicity usually is an attempt to mask a failure. In this case the publicity is well deserved.<br/><br/>It's a drama and a story of treason. It depicts the context only to show that the new rulers are the same, turncoats as they get called by the end of the movie. I was shocked to have the same feeling as after reading Orwell's Animal Farm. And in a way it's the same story, only in a different context.<br/><br/>From a distance the first part looks like The Thin Red Line. Only that the impact is more violent. In The Thin Red Line the men are doomed, but behind them the families, ""the civilization"" goes on. In here there is no hope, there is no civilization and doom is spelled for all both young and all alike.<br/><br/>This movie is not perfect, yet a statement this bold deserves more than 10 stars. To be able to call the honorable Royal Army what it is, this alone is a sign of courage. To call both parties for what they are and avoid taking the comfort of one side, now this is something in the World of Today. And Mr. Loach goes even further, he goes against his audience. He takes away the sickening optimism and stupid Hollywood-style happy end to unmask the treason, to show the World the naked truth of armed conflicts.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
"nospam78","8","1","8","16 September 2007"," Powerful, disturbing but flawed
","Ken Loach takes a subject which has been done to death and manages to inject freshness and urgency to it. Yes, there is disturbing violence but it is historically accurate. The Black and Tans were the lowest dregs of the English prison system, violent psychopaths who were sent to wage a war of terror in Ireland because there was a shortage of regular troops after World War One. Given amnesty in return for going to Ireland, and hastily kitted out in mismatched uniforms which gave them their nickname, the Black and Tans marauded across Ireland raping and murdering at will and burning whole towns to the ground. If anything, Loach was restrained in his depiction.<br/><br/>The Irish resistance had no choice but to fight fire with fire. The scene where a young man is executed for giving information to the British is also disturbing but accurate. Then we see the Church siding first with the British and then with the Free State, and we see the Free State soldiers adopting British tactics and oppressing their own people - all very tragic and true to life. I can't help thinking that the Treaty - which the Brits wrote and then presented to the Irish with ""Take it or leave it, and if you leave it we'll slaughter every last one of you"" - was engineered to provoke a civil war in Ireland. There were so many clauses which served no purpose except to insult and humiliate the Irish. I also suspect the British were bluffing - much as they'd have liked to wage ""immediate and terrible war"" against Ireland, they didn't have the strength after WWI - but we'll never know.<br/><br/>That said, I don't agree that this is an anti-British or anti-Irish or anti-any other group film. The whole point of the film, it seems to me, is that war brutalizes, and turns brother against brother. This is a universal theme that anyone can relate to.<br/><br/>The film is not without faults. Cillian Murphy does a very authentic West Cork accent (but then he's from Cork City, though that's in the east of the county) and so do several of the other fighters, but some of the ""locals"" (especially Orla Fitzgerald) have strong Dublin accents which are jarringly out of place.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw is that the ending is weak and anti-climactic. It seems like Loach was trying too hard to make his point, and he does so in a heavy-handed and not very believable way - and then the movie suddenly ends. It was a disappointing ending to an otherwise gripping film.<br/><br/>On the whole, however, this is a very powerful film that is well worth seeing. Those who dismiss it out of hand (sight unseen) as a propaganda film are totally missing the point."
"lastliberal","8","1","10","17 January 2008"," Is this how our revolution started?
","I cannot watch this film without thinking that this must be the way the American revolution against the British started. If one just believes a small part of this portrayal of the British to be true, then there is ample justification for all revolutions against them. The soldiers in this film would make great customers for Hostel.<br/><br/>Ken Loach tells a great story here about a ragtag band of freedom fighters that go up against the British occupiers.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy (Red Eye, 28 Days Later...) is excellent as a doctor that joins the IRA after seeing abuse after abuse by the British. Padraic Delaney as Teddy and Orla Fitzgerald as Sinead added immensely to the film.<br/><br/>Of course, the freedom fighters are sold out by their friends, the church and the landowners, and it is many more generations before Ireland can taste freedom.<br/><br/>Barry Ackroyd's cinematography in County Cork was stupendous, as was the fantastic soundtrack."

"undreechileno","5","0","2","2 June 2017"," good intentions, poor realization
","From a standpoint of an admirer of Irish culture and history, I will try to say a few words about this film. Firstly I will go ahead and agree with the one of the previous reviews on the fact that the events portrayed in the film are most likely true. However, the very film seems like a poor propaganda, resembling a few pathetic Yugoslavian communist films. It most certainly lacks constructive plot. Sadly, even though the Irish were on the righteous side of this fight, after watching this, it might make you feel that they weren't and they just tried to make things right with this film. Dialogues lack drama but doubtlessly do not lack clichés. Clear proof of this is a case in which Brits raid rebels' homes and in this occasion manage to call them by every single derogatory name (mick bastard, fenian bastard, Irish prick,etc.)<br/><br/>The director tried to adapt the tragic and heroic events from Irish history into a movie but failed hard to so. One time I watched Come and See (Idi i Smotri), a Belorussian film about WWII. This film left me with such strong impression that I wished to go out and kill a whole lot of Nazis. This is the kind of emotion that a good historical film should trigger. THIS FILM, HOWEVER, DOES THE VERY OPPOSITE. IT IS NOT WORTHY OF THIS BEAUTIFUL, POETIC TITLE WHICH WAS ACTUALLY TAKEN FROM AN OLD IRISH BALLAD. <br/><br/>You might as well skip this one, don't throw away 2 hours of your life."

","It's 1920 Ireland. Damien O'Donovan (Cillian Murphy), his crush Sinead (Orla Fitzgerald), and his friends are harassed by the British Black and Tans. His friend and Sinead's brother Micheail is beaten to death. He abandons practicing medicine in a London hospital to join the fight against British occupation under his brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney) who commands the local IRA brigade. They get captured and imprisoned with Dan (Liam Cunningham). Damien had witnessed the socialist train driver Dan being beaten by British troops for refusing to transport them. They manage to escape. After tough fighting, the Anglo-Irish Treaty is signed at the end of 1921. Teddy pleads for acceptance of the autonomous Irish Free State under the British crown. Damien follows Dan's fight for a socialist independent republic for the entire island. The two brothers end up on opposite sides of a civil war.<br/><br/>The British are shown as sadistic villains. It's a little over the top but certainly not unexpected. The brothers' relationship could be more emphasized. Cillian Murphy is the star. I wish Padraic Delaney could be his equal. The most compelling parts are after the treaty when the brothers struggle to not fight each other. It turns a nationalist independence war into a personal family war. Cillian is so infuriating that I wanted to shake him. It ends not with a heroic fight but a family tragedy."

After that, the players go back home. The lives in a little hamlet, in the Irish countryside. But there, they are screeching halt by the forces of the British orders. Normally, all public meeting, sport include, are band, because of the war. The forces of British orders ask them about their names and jobs, but one of the Irishes, Micheail, answer in Gaelic, which is a prohibited language. Because of that, he's killed by the forces of British orders. Damien, who wants to become a doctor, must go to London to continue his studies, but the others think it's a treason. The want him in the Irish Republican Army, to revolt, and avenge the death of Micheail. He refuses. To go to London, Damien go to the train station. There, the forces of British orders want the driver go back in the train and drive. But the driver refuse. The soldiers hit him and his assistant. It's thank to that and to the death of Micheail, Damien changes his mind, and join the IRA.... The Wind that shake the barley is a true representation of the Anglo-Irish war and the Irish civil war. It's explained very well. I really liked this movie because you learn a lot of things about the Irish history. It's really interesting. I recommend it to people who want to know things about Ireland's history, and who are not too sensitive, because it's a quite violent movie. But don't worry, it'not too complicated to understand.

"FedRev","9","0","1","13 November 2014"," Excellent film about the politics of resistance
","The Wind that Shakes the Barley is a politically sophisticated war film set during the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War between the years of 1919 and 1923. The film has a very authentic sensibility and depicts the war between the Irish Republican Army and the occupying British force. The British harass, intimidate, and murder the locals in their attempt to squash the rebellion, and the Irish utilize guerrilla tactics to ward off their occupiers. The film centers around two brothers who fight together for the IRA, and then later against each other on opposite sides of the Civil War after a compromise had been reached with the British. Barley examines two ideologies: one, the principle that people should fight to completely free themselves of oppression and imperialist occupation, and two, that the occupied should resist just enough to force concessions from the imperialists. The second faction turns on the first when they continue to fight for complete independence even after the Irish government signs a treaty with the British. While Loach's film portrays both factions in the Civil War with generally equal time, it's clear his film sides with the Republicans who didn't compromise their principles and continued to fight for freedom and true independence, and rightfully so."

"BeneCumb","8","0","2","16 February 2014"," Revolutions often devour their own children...
","All wars and violent revolutions were ""created"" to solve some serious issues - often they did, but - in turn - brought forth new ones, with all means employed. Families were split and friendships were deprived, enemy figures changed faster that the years and solutions were interpreted according to own judgments and skills. Plus the fact that some people get used to fighting and long-term confrontation are unable to re-enter into ""normal"" civil life.<br/><br/>The Wind That Shakes the Barley is a fine example of all this taking place during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1922) and the Irish Civil War (1922–1923) - through the eyes and fate of two brothers, Damien and Teddy O'Donovan, splendidly performed by Cillian Murphy and Pádraic Delaney, respectively. Tensions are maintained up high to the end, accentuated by fierce shooting events, brutal behaviour of the British soldiers and - last but not least - desolate Irish landscape and weather. All this seems realistic even to me who is unaware of those events, and the result is a strong and catchy war drama (according to Ken Loach style) - to be watched alone or in a company of like-minded, and although some women have significant role in the film, it does probably not bespeak contemporary women."

","The Wind that Shakes the Barley is an inspirational film of dedication and perseverance. It delves into the world of family division and fighting for a seemingly hopeless cause. Teddy fights for a resolve to the oppression of the English but his younger brother Damien strives for complete emancipation. Through dialogue, camera angles and plot the film gives the impression that the potentially fatal devotion to liberty Damien has is correct and justified. The director positions the viewer to agree with and accept Damien's idealistic pursuit.<br/><br/>The film seems to follow Damien as the main character; the director focuses on him. Out of all the pertinent characters, Damien has the most development. He has story lines aside from the battle for freedom. We relate to Damien and therefore believe his stand points are just and reasonable. Damien has a girl in his life. He has someone to worry about beside himself. He is fighting for her safety as well as his own. The director intentionally expanded on Damien's character more than his opposite Teddy. Damien had close friendships with other characters. Damien and Dan's relationship grew as the plot carried on. Through the conversations he had with Dan parts of his personality and opinions were displayed. The writer did not give any of the other men a more dimensional character, beside a soldier. Due to the humanization of Damien's character we are naturally drawn to view his goal as honourable and dignified."

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","2","8 October 2011"," Powerful but polemical
","British director Ken Loach always makes films that are political in the broadest sense and several - such as ""Carla's Song"", ""Land And Freedom"" and this one - are explicitly about real-life political situations in another time and place. The enigmatic title is taken from a poem by 19th century poet Robert Dwyer Joyce and the subject matter is the Irish fight for independence from Britain in the early 1920s. In this powerful film as in the other two, Loach requires the viewer to work hard because the strong Irish accents make the dialogue difficult to follow and the internecine politics may be obscure to those not versed in Irish history.<br/><br/>The story is told through the conflicting perspectives of two brothers: Teddy (Padraic Delaney), an early recruit to the armed struggle who is later ready to accept the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and Damien (Cillian Murphy), initially reluctant to take up arms but then unwilling to support the Free State. As in ""Land And Freedom"", there is a scene involving a prolonged political debate - an unusual feature in movies - and, although, both sides are enunciated, it is clear that Loach as always favours the more radical position.<br/><br/>""The Wind That Shakes The Barley"" makes an interesting contrast with that of ""Michael Collins"" which covers similar ground and was produced 10 years earlier."

","I have to admit for the first ten minutes of the movie I was trying to decipher the thick accents of the Irish actors. I thought it was troublesome at first, but as the movie continued I realized without the accents the scene really wouldn't have been set.<br/><br/>The Wind that Shakes the Barley is an incredibly powerful film. It is centered around the rather bloody Irish revolution against the British, (which for revolutions, was actually rather recent) but goes deeper into the conflict than the fighting. Cillian Murphy proves himself to be a fine actor as the movie progresses. The movie shows that both sides were not correct as both the British and the Irish committed crimes. Not only is the violence of war horrific, but so is the effect on the minds of those who are involved. For the Irish, it starts with pure intentions and then snowballs into something deadly.<br/><br/>As an American viewer, it is a bit hard to understand and stomach at first. But for me it became a testament of Irish history, the struggles those involved in the conflict faced as well as the artistry of Irish film making. <br/><br/>With that said, it deserves ten out of ten."

It's a story that'll make you feel for all the characters, and the message of this story is timeless: ""No one wins when in war""<br/><br/>So the plot? The plot is about two brothers: Damien (Cillian Murphy) and Teddy (Padraic Delaney) who join the IRA to help fend off and rebel against the English forces that govern Ireland. But when the English give their own proposition: it seems like the entire country is divided between whether to quiet down and accept it or to continue fighting until the end. <br/><br/>What a marvelous example of a beautiful film. I'll start with the acting. As usual, Cillian Murphy is amazing and completely draws you into the character. Padraic Delaney was also very well acted, and you could honestly believe that they were two brothers, torn between what they think is best for their country and people. The other characters, even those who have a minor role make you feel as if you are a part of this war. You will cry and cheer for the characters as they fight for freedom.<br/><br/>Ken Loach deserves special recognition for how he wanted this movie to be portrayed. It's not a war movie where over-macho, testosterone-filled jug heads like to blow up anything that's wearing a different colored T- shirt then them. Instead this movie focuses on the emotions and feelings that the people are experiencing. It's about the voice of the people at a desperate time. It's about the courage to stand up for what you believe and to come together as one to unite and defend your country. And Ken Loach does such an amazing job at showing us exactly what happens when you are faced with decisions regarding your personal interest, and the interest of the people as a whole. There is one scene in particular where the town is at church that I replayed over and over again, just for the sheer tension, emotion, and opinions that are shown of the townsfolk. <br/><br/>As for the ""controversial views"" that many critics seem to latch onto? As far as I'm concerned, it's a very well acted, presented and shot movie that draws you in. That's it: that's what a movie is. It's ridiculous to assume that ""everyone is good and lives happily ever after"": it's the story of a country's fight for independence. <br/><br/>I could keep on rambling about how amazing and spectacular this movie is: but if you really want to experience it: watch it! There's just too much to talk about. It's refreshing to see a movie step away from the ""safe"" views of Hollywood and go back to the roots of what movies are really about.<br/><br/>So in a nutshell? Amazing movie, I recommend it to anyone who knows how to appreciate a fantastic film. I loved it and have watched it many times since. It made me smile but most of all made me bawl like a little girl. Watch it and you won't regret it."

","Ken Loach has never shied away from political issues in his movies, and ""The Wind that Shakes the Barley"" is no exception. Cillian Murphy plays a medical student in 1920 Ireland. He plans to move to England to continue his studies, but after witnessing atrocities committed by the Black and Tans, he and his brother (Pádraic Delaney) decide to join the IRA. In addition to showing the brutality of the British towards the Irish, the movie also poses a question about independence: once a country gains independence, will it be business as usual just with different people in power, or will there be real change? This is definitely a movie that anyone who wants to understand the situation in Northern Ireland, and possibly the economic collapse that Ireland has had, should see.<br/><br/>Also starring Orla Fitzgerald, Liam Cunningham, Mary Murphy, Roger Allam, Shane Casey and Sean McGinley."

","1920: Two Irish brothers, Damion O'Donovan (played by Cillian Murphy) and Teddy O'Donovan (Pádraic Delaney) join the IRA to fight for independence.<br/><br/>I thought at first this was going to be just another war drama, but the movie gives a very authentic feeling, and at times I almost forgot I was watching actors. There's a real sense of place, time and mentality.<br/><br/>The movie is being clever by not turning the Irish fighters into superheroes but rather as scared and proud people who didn't always agree on what is right to do in terms of justice between themselves. There is a great court scene explaining this very point.<br/><br/>In the end, you could say it's also the story of two brothers the war has divided, the way it has divided their whole land.

"intelearts","8","0","6","2 May 2011"," My 406th Review: Emotive, emotional account of two brothers and the early day of modern Eire
","TWTSTB is not a difficult film to simply like or admire: it deals with a sensitive subject - the control and abuse by the British of Eire in 1922, the handing over under the Dublin Accord, and the subsequent civil war that occurred.<br/><br/>Rather than going big and sweeping Ken Loach with his normal panache chooses to focus on one family and one community - and the film is better for it - here we get the moral conflict and the hope for a better future through independence. <br/><br/>Ken Loach pulls no punches in depicting the English as arrogant pigs who abuse the locals and their power and show no respect or attempt to befriend anyone: they are cruel, vicious, and sadistic from the off. As nearly all the major critics have pointed out, it's nigh on impossible to see this without drawing analogies to the contemporaneous Iraqi situation - stop and searches, random snatches, even language barriers; however this is a film is that is very much about Ireland and its identity and its values.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot, with excellent production values throughout, the story is compelling, and keeps up a cracking pace throughout - a mixture of action, drama, and politics - it is both uncomfortable viewing, but in its own way, mainstream too.<br/><br/>It really is a film about what price freedom, true freedom and democracy takes - and as an account of history it is excellent.<br/><br/>Ken Loach is not afraid to be honest, and to challenge our comfort zones. This film won the Palm D'or at the Canne Film Festival for good reasons - worth seeing in every way."

The scenery and acting were very good and it has been good to watch a good argument that does not need to get complicated to take the point across.<br/><br/>The only thing I disliked about this movie is the negative portrayal of the British characters, consisting mainly of rude soldiers; I am not sure whether all Britons looked at the Irish with contempt at that time, because I have little knowledge of European history, but that was the sensation I got from this story.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people which are interested in a simple argument which delivers, good character development and nice Irish visuals."

It left an impression that all is in vain, the world only takes away what is precious and beautiful and leaves behind the broken remains, yet those remains have to carry on.

"rotildao","8","0","4","7 April 2008"," Wind that makes them shake
","This is the kind of movie everyone should watch. Or is it not? Well, I guess in current times where people prefer to be blind towards serious matters, then, this one is a must-see, but how do we clearly ""see"" that? <br/><br/>If movies like Braveheart, Michael Collins, Passion of Joan of Arc, or Silkwood, are more and more seemingly just like the fading of memory, then more and more movies like No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood will keep on filling this ""momentary"" need of a few people to ignore history and its martyrs. This movie is not a masterpiece; however, it has a differential from previous martyrs-movies, if I can call those like that... this one clearly makes us see the two kinds of people who create the martyrs: <br/><br/>1. the ones in power, who no longer see or touch reality at all, due to their large-scale occupations; <br/><br/>2. Their followers, who are in constant visual contact with serious issues, but are hired to mediate and numb any serious issue out of anyone who think has one. <br/><br/>With all the distractions, fear does not get stronger, and for some time is no longer perceived. And from Braveheart to Silkwood (historically, or in real life) time still passes, and new presidents get elected, and most likely a son of a previous president, or a prince, then he hires more new people to distract more new and poorer people... and after two thousand years martyrs from Braveheart (previous Alexander Nevski, or Spartacus) to Silkwood simply die or get killed. And in the end, we, the audience,are the ones who actually have to watch all of this. We applaud. We feed this recycling chase throughout times and we choose what we find interesting at that moment, so we can see it, look at it, understand it... and very little changes, except our fear of death. When the wind blows, not only barley shakes, but the trees, buildings, our bodies, even the sand in the desert shakes. Now, do you think selling yourself out for some sort of comfort and false safety is not enough distraction? Then let the breeze in!"
"TxMike","Null","0","7","5 November 2007"," The history of Ireland's resistance of British rule.
","It was the 1920s and England had a military presence in the mostly peaceful Ireland. Early in the movie we see rogue British troops treating woman and children badly, and burning homes, sometimes killing innocent people.<br/><br/>This ignited the pride of the people and really put the 'ire' in Ireland. Bans of loosely organized Irish, who began to can themselves Republicans, were the genesis to the IRA, the Irish Republican Army.<br/><br/>At one of the wakes for a killed Irishman, an old lady was singing a folk song, and one line contained the works ""Wind that Shakes the Barley."" I don't know if the title has any other meaning, regarding the uprising against the British.<br/><br/>Cillian Murphy is in the lead role as Damien. As history tells us, Ireland has remained a free republic, and only Northern Ireland is part of Great Britain.<br/><br/>Very good movie. Doesn't paint a very flattering picture of the British."
"Andy-296","8","0","6","5 April 2007"," Great movie about Irish War of Independence
","A movie about the Anglo-Irish war and the subsequent Irish Civil War told from a strongly pro-republican point of view. Cillian Murphy plays Damien, an apolitical Irish student, planning to become a doctor in London, who after witnessing the English brutal repression of Irish independence, decides to join his brother in the armed struggle to liberate Ireland from the English yoke. Director Ken Loach is certainly not among the most fluid of filmmakers, his movie is sometimes didactic, but is also consistently informative and interesting (it certainly lead me to look more information about this historical period on the Internet). The beautiful actress Orla Fitzgerald, playing Murphy's girlfriend, adds to the movie's appeal. The movie ends in a sad note: when the terms of the peace fails to conform the more belligerent Irish republicans (who particularly objected to the required oath to the King), the civil war erupts, and it ends up putting (literally) brother against brother. All in all, a highly recommended film."
"howard.schumann","8","0","7","19 March 2007"," Loach pulls no punches
","The Wind that Shakes the Barley, directed by Ken Loach and written by Paul Laverty, deals with the Irish War of Independence of 1919-1921 and the subsequent civil war (1922-23) as experienced by two brothers, fighting on opposite sides of the conflict. The film, winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2006, dramatizes the role played by the Black and Tan, a special auxiliary force formed by British ex-soldiers who acquired a reputation for violent reprisals against the civilian population in Ireland after attacks by the old Irish Republican Army (IRA). Many incidents in the film, according to Laverty, are based on true events though the characters may be composites.<br/><br/>Loach was attacked by critics in Britain for his ""poisonous"" film that was called a ""travesty"" by another reviewer. Both reviewers later admitted that they had not seen the film. To Loach it is understandable that ""they try to cover things up, and for 80 years trying to patch these things over simply hasn't worked"". As the film begins, after a hurling match in a rural village, a group of players are set upon by British soldiers who kill a young man because he is unable or unwilling to say his name in English. Damien O'Donovan, played by the charismatic Cillian Murphy, a young medical student preparing to go to London, is shocked by this brutality.<br/><br/>After another incident that occurs at a train station when a union engineer is beaten by British thugs, he decides to remain in County Cork and join his brother Teddy (Padraic Delaney), an active IRA member in forming a local ""flying column"". The group trains for guerilla warfare with hockey sticks until they are able to steal some guns from a British stronghold. Damien soon learns the true cost of war when he is forced to execute a local lad who had given evidence to the British, resulting in the death of two IRA members and later admits to his girlfriend, ""I can't feel anything anymore."" Many atrocities occur and Loach shows that they were not limited to the British. After one attack on a British patrol, an IRA commander tells his troops, ""If they bring their savagery over here, we will meet it with a savagery of our own."" Weary of conflict, the IRA rejoices when a treaty is announced creating The Irish Free State in the South and leaving Northern Ireland under British rule but after details of the treaty are announced, the brothers find themselves on different sides. Teddy overrules the first true Irish court because he wants to remain on good terms with local business people who may be exploiting the poor people but who supply arms for the IRA.<br/><br/>This splits the group with one side believing that the solution offered by the British is the best that they can hope for, and the other side, led by Damien, vowing to continue the fight for a completely independent socialist nation, invoking the memory of socialist leader James Connolly who said ""If you remove the English army tomorrow and hoist the green flag over Dublin Castle, unless you set about the organization of the Socialist Republic, your efforts would be in vain."" One volunteer says, ""Lads, we have freedom within our grasp. We're that close. It's just one inch but it's still out of reach. And if we stop now, we will never again regain the power that I can feel in this room today. And if we stop short now, never in our lifetime will we see that energy again. Ever!"" While it is clear that Loach sides with those who wanted to continue the fight, the film deals with the substance of what happened. When Damien and his followers refuse to swear allegiance to the British monarchy, Teddy takes up arms for the Irish Free State and his army emulates the heavy-handed tactics of the former occupiers but their motivations are not fully explored and the sudden shift is confusing. While The Wind That Shakes the Barley is clear about the resistance that inevitably occurs when a powerful country occupies a weaker nation, to those unfamiliar with the historical details, it might have benefited from more information about the background of the conflict and its legacy in Ireland today.<br/><br/>In spite of a flat ending that should have been powerful and moving, The Wind That Shakes the Barley pulls no punches and makes a strong point that is very relevant to today's conflict in the Middle East. According to Loach, ""The British army in Ireland during 1920-21 did what armies of occupation do the world over  adopt a racist attitude towards the people they are attacking and occupying. They destroy people's houses, engage in acts of brutality and generally oppress the people  and in Iraq that's exactly what the British army is doing."" One can trust that these actions will not be hidden for 80 years."
"paulmartin-2","8","0","7","30 October 2006"," Cinematic excellence, but may be difficult for some
","I found this film difficult to watch. War brings out the worst in human nature. Things that normal, rational human beings would not normally do, they do with fervour. Criminals get to not only legitimise their behaviour, but are lauded as heroes for it. Mob mentality, under the banner of patriotism, rules. Good people are damned. And nothing has changed in the current political climate, which is perhaps the subtext of this film.<br/><br/>I didn't find the depiction of the British caricatured. The Black & Tans were virtual assassination squads, and the brutality is comparable to what goes on to this day. Think Abu Ghraib, East Timor, Camp Delta at Guantanamo Bay or even the police beatings recently publicised in Melbourne  not pretty stuff.<br/><br/>While the film could be wrongly seen as anti-British, I think it's anti-war. It simply depicts what the British did. But the Irish were also involved in atrocities, and the war tore them apart (just like what's happening in Iraq). This is why war should always be avoided at all costs.<br/><br/>The film depicts the devastating emotional impact on families and communities with a rare, unglorified realism. The cinematography and period reproduction were absolutely sensational. This film is a strong cinematic contribution by an important director. Technically, the film was first class, but I find it hard to give a higher score because of the difficulty of the subject matter."
