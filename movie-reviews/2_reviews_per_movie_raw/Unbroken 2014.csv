","""Unbroken"" is based on the excellent award-winning inspirational book (2010) by Laura Hillebrand, who has an eye for detail and description. It is a biography of the exciting life of Louis Silvie Zamperini of Torrance, California. This review includes several details that were omitted in the movie, included to clarify certain situations.<br/><br/>Louis Zamperini (C.J. Valleroy as young Louie, Jack O'Connell in the title role) was restless and incorrigible as a Californian youth. Bullied, he was a juvenile delinquent. His older brother Pete (John D'Leo, Alex Russell), however, began to take more interest in him and became his mentor when Louie decided to run track. Pete rode his bike as Louie ran alongside him; later he ran far ahead. By high school Louie was setting state and national records: ""The Torrance Tornado"" became the fastest high school runner in US history. At age 19 he was already in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games even though his body was still too young (undeveloped) to win a medal. Nevertheless he surprised even Hitler when he ran the fastest last lap of the 5,000-meter race in 56 seconds. Although robbed of his chance to break a world track record and run an under four-minute mile at the now-canceled 1940 Olympics, Louie continues to train in the vain hope that war will end by 1944, the next scheduled games. <br/><br/>At film's beginning Louie is a flight lieutenant, a World War II bombardier on a B-24 Liberator that has just completed a successful raid on the Japanese-held island of Nauru in the south Pacific (1943). Although the airplane is shot up and crew members are wounded, the crew limps back successfully to base at Funafuti (now Tuvalu). The next mission involves rescuing a downed B-24 crew near the island of Palmyra. But Louie's crew is given ""The Green Hornet,"" an airplane that was not really fly-worthy. Sure enough an engine fails at an inopportune time and the plane has to be ditched over the vast Pacific Ocean (27 May 1943). There was no bail out because of the notorious shark-infested waters. Three of eleven crew members survive (Louie, Phil, Mac); they occupy two rubber rafts lashed together. One of them, friend Allen ""Phil"" Phillip (Domhnall Gleason) has a head wound. The scenes involving the albatross and sharks are as described in the book. Sharks constantly ran their bodies and fins along the raft bottom; the men could feel them (Yikes!). The book describes how more than one of the smaller sharks actually leaped onto the raft; a timely oar saved Louie's head. Then a twenty-foot long Great White slammed against the raft bottom, sending three men into the air. Luckily they landed atop the raft. Francis McNamara (""Mac,"" Finn Wittrock) eats all of the rationed chocolate, the only food. Eventually catatonic, he expires. In violation of the Geneva Convention, a Japanese Zero strafes them. After a record 47 harrowing days of thirst and starvation at sea on rubber rafts, the two survivors receive both good and bad news: they are rescued by the enemy. <br/><br/>After interrogation at notorious Kwajalein, where prisoners were previously executed, Louie and Phil are eventually sent first to Ofuna Prisoner of War (POW) camp, then Omori in Tokyo Bay. Right away Louie is targeted by sadistic Japanese Corporal Watanabe (""The Bird,"" Takamasa Ishiara), who constantly beats him unmercifully. Although the Geneva Convention excludes officers from work details, many are forced into labor. Not working meant that one-half of the already meager rations were cut. Getting enough food to avoid starvation was problematic because of pilferage. Foods allocated for prisoners were stolen by both Japanese military and civilians and sold on the black market. Although Red Cross relief packages had been sent to the POWs, they too were confiscated. To avoid starvation, POWs had to do their own pilfering! (At war's end 1500 unopened Red Cross boxes were discovered locked in a prison storehouse!) The book further describes how Louie and other men were used as test subjects for experiments in biological / chemical warfare. Cloudy liquid forcibly injected into arms caused dizziness and nausea.<br/><br/>Serendipity strikes Louie when Japanese intelligence discovers that American military has mistakenly assumed his death. Knowing that the capture of an American Olympic athlete has propaganda value, the Japanese allow Louie to radio broadcast a harmless message that he is alive and well. After that Louie gets a nice meal in a Japanese cafeteria. But Louie is soon approached by high level Japanese civilians, who want him to disparage America over airwaves. As Louie cannot act in good conscience, it is back to POW camp with Watanabe. Towards war's end, Louie is transferred to the grimy coal barges on Japan's west coast (Naeotsu). War's end and homecoming cannot come soon enough (1945). The instincts that helped Louie endure his mutinous youth had helped keep him alive in despairing situations. Although his post-traumatic stress disorder and religious conversion were skipped, closing captions briefly explain that Louie married and later returned to Japan to forgive his captors for their cruel treatment. The exception was Watanabe, the Bird; he was assumed dead. Not until 1997 did Louie discover that Watanabe was still alive; he died in 2003. The ending shows the real life footage of Zamperini as an old man running the torch for the Winter Olympics (1998), not far from his old POW camp. Louie lived until 2014, dying just a few months before picture release.<br/><br/>Although the movie doesn't cover Louie's post-war years, it is still entertaining. It was nominated for three Academy Awards and won several others. One should not expect the picture to be as detailed as the book. Perhaps the feature could have been extended by, say, thirty minutes; Angelina Jolie directed. The screenplay is decent enough and Roger Deakins' cinematography is excellent. Jack O'Connell plays the tough Italian wonderfully and is inspiring as a man constantly beaten down but who mentally defeats his enemies."
"lastliberal-853-253708","8","39","45","10 July 2015"," A good introduction to the book
","I never compare books and movies, but one thing the book has over the movie was the distinct unpreparedness we had for war. The planes were flying deathtraps, and the supplies were totally inadequate.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie had to make decisions about what to include and exclude in a two-hour film, so we missed a lot of important information that was in the book. No matter, the film itself was well worth watching. Not a great film, but entertaining.<br/><br/>If you want to be shocked and angered at the aircraft manufacturers, the military that failed to supply the troops ( where have we heard that before?), and the absolute barbarity of the Japanese in their prison camps, buy the book.<br/><br/>Come to think about it, watching the film will help you appreciate the book so much more."
"secondtake","7","58","75","10 February 2015"," Fabulous story, and troubling, but also weirdly bland, despite first rate filming...
","Unbroken (2014)<br/><br/>Heartbreaking, inspiring true story, told and directed in straight up high quality realism. There is some true intensity in the fighting scenes, in the survival scenes on the raft, and in the prison camp with its torture and hardship. And this is balanced by determination and hope.<br/><br/>If that sounds generic, in a way that fits—the movie follows some tried and true formulas. The beginning has us with the hero, Louis Zamperini (played by Jack O'Connell), in a big bomber heading for some targets against Japan in WWII. As trouble begins, leading to the crash which makes up the real start of the movie, we also get flashbacks to his simple Italian-American childhood. This is effective, but it's sentimental stuff. And it lets you know the kind of wholesome intentions of the movie.<br/><br/>There is a lot going on here, in three main sections: running, surviving on a raft, and the prison camps. That Zamperini suffers and endures is the point of the film, and in that way the narrative is very straight forward. There are villains and buddies. The skies rain bombs and the sea is full of sharks. Some people are merciless, and others kind. But in the middle, through every turn and travail, is Zamperini. ""If you can take it, you can make it,"" is a mantra in the film, and that's the message.<br/><br/>The direction and photography were first ratevery subtle in a spectacular way (or vice versa). It's a truly fine film, and director Angelina Jolie (in her second feature, after a terrible first try) does a really good job. The story, co-written by the Coen brothers and others, based on a book by Laura Hillenbrand, is a great bit of history, quite sensational stuff.<br/><br/>So why did we leave the movie feeling just so-so about it all? I'm not sure how to nicely say this, but it's really a good story, well told, lacking some quality of surprise or depth it really needs to rise above. As amazing as the photography and editing (and so on) are, it's all in service to a fairly ordinary kind of story. Not that this man's life is ordinary at all, but the way it develops and is told is oddly routine, as narrative storytelling.<br/><br/>Good stuff, for sure. It's a bit hard to take sometimes for its brutality--there is a lot of graphic, personal violence--and the Japanese camps are portrayed as truly cruel (which many in Japan object to). But it's an impressive movie in many ways."

","I cannot understand the negative reviews of this movie ,are the themes of bravery,endurance and forgiveness outdated?It is well known that the regeime of Japanese prison camps was cruel to say the least.The acting of the lead players was faultless proving again that British and Irish actors can play the roles of Americans.I found the movie moving, inspirational. Yes it was violent but not gratious. Ms Jolie is to be congratulated on her directing.

"patbradley435","8","59","78","25 January 2015"," Not as bad as they are all saying
","Okay, I've read Hilenbrand's book, which is simply riveting. Louis Zamperini's story is almost unbelievable and the movie cannot possibly do it justice in just over two hours. This could easily have stretched to four hours, but today's cinema-going public haven't got that kind of patience. The film is well done and I was certainly thoroughly entertained by it, knowing in advance it would never be as good as the book, but it certainly didn't leave me cold, demanding my ticket price back. Just watch this for the good movie that it is. Yes it could have been better, but it's a very good attempt by Jolie at the book. I just cannot understand why so many people have given it bad reviews. IMDb puzzles me greatly at times, especially when some awful movies get glowing reviews. Is there some sinister network of people out to sabotage certain movies? I really don't know. This is a very decent movie and Jolie should be proud of it."
"paul_3-960-896774","7","31","40","19 January 2015"," A story to admire
","When I first heard about this film, I got really excited about the story but the mix reviews had me walking into the theater ready to nitpick. <br/><br/>Some people might not agree with me but the film was masterfully directed. It showcases the war, in all its aspects battles, death, starvation, and torture without inflaming the audience. I've seen documentaries that left me wanting vengeance for the oppressed. Unbroken is about Louie's forgiveness, his resilience despite what was done to him and the film does just that. It's sturdy and infused with darkness, shows the gruesome and the brutality but it does not make you angry, hopping for Japan to burn for what they did to him. On the contrary you hope for Louie to stand strong and stick it out.<br/><br/>Watching the movie there's an implied understanding for both sides, you won't like that Louie's brutalized and mentally tortured but at the same time you're not hating the guys brutalizing him. It helps to know how it'll end, which also explains the lack of emotional involvement, but it's about Louie during WWII. Louie is not depicted as a victim but as a person. I know the general consensus would be to almost break him down in order to build him back up but that would have been like blowing things up like a Michael Bay movie.<br/><br/>The performances throughout the cast was good, Angelina Jolie got the what she needed from the cast to tell this story in this particular way. The pace of the film fits to the story, the rhythm matches its narrative structure because it all flows together, it kind of sucks you in and bring you along for the ride. The side stories flows well in the overall narrative structure of the film. It's very easy to watch with its amazing array of beautiful colors and shots. There is a lot of potential in Angelina Jolie as a director.<br/><br/>Unbroken is a beautiful movie all around, the shots are mesmerizing, even the CGI ones, and the cast is on point. The story is inspiring and feels real. It's a big studio movie but it manages to feel intimate like an indie.<br/><br/>Tweet me @wornoutspines"
"claudio_carvalho","7","17","21","6 January 2016"," A True Story of Courage
","During the World War II, the bombardier Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and the pilot Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) are assigned in a rescue mission in an old plane immediately after a successful bombing mission. Soon two engines blow up and the plane crashes in the sea, and only Louie, Phil and Mac (Finn Wittrock) survive. Louie is a former Olympian from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and stubborn since he was a kid, and he encourages his mates. After a month on the sea surviving in two rafts, Mac dies. A couple of weeks later, they are captured by the Japanese marines and sent to a P.O.W. camp in Tokyo. The commander Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) is a sadistic and frustrated man and treats Louis with cruelty since he was Olympian. But Louis is hardheaded and brave and is not broken by Watanabe, resisting his torture and inspiring his mates in the camp. <br/><br/>""Unbroken"" is a film directed by Angeline Jolie based on the impressive true story of the former Olympian Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini. The story is engaging and the screenplay is well written, showing the personality of Louie through flashbacks. The reconstitution of the period is also excellent. However, there is lack of emotion and the film does not touch the heart of the viewer. The only feeling inspired by this film is anger and hatred towards Watanabe. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Invencível"" (""Invincible"")"
"bison_burger","2","254","403","2 January 2015"," Incredible story, horrible screen adaptation
","Louis Zamperini's story of survival was robbed of all feeling and emotion in this screen portrayal. Jolie has cast a very flat, laconic, and unconvincing crew of young Abercrombie models who lack the depth of seasoned actors who would have otherwise convinced us that there was actual pain and suffering throughout this. After a month afloat on a raft the three men's hair was well-groomed and one even had a goatee (are there razors in the survival kit?). I felt like I was watching Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers; if you have seen this movie you will know exactly what I am taking about. Read the book - it will give you the emotion and satisfaction you are entitled to from this survival story."
"juliecharbanic","3","126","194","26 December 2014"," Where is the rest of the story?!
","***May Contain Spoilers*** The story of Louis Zamperini is only half told in Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken."" After watching a screening of this film I did a little internet research on Mr. Zamperini and found that his life post-war, in my opinion, was equally emotional, meaningful and film worthy as his POW years. This film, while beautifully shot, lacked the true depth of Zamperini's life. In the beginning of the film, Angelina Jolie goes overboard in showing the viewer his early life and his Olympic journey. Next up are the war years and POW torture. The End. In addition to not feeling anything toward Zamperini's chief brutalizer, the torture scenes were way too long. After a few scenes viewers will get the point that this man went through Hell. What happens after the war is where the real story begins and where ""Unbroken"" stops. Louis Zamperini's struggles continued for quite some time until he found God. This new journey took him back to Japan where he sought out his captors and forgave them. However, his nemesis, the Bird, did not want to meet him...but Zamperini tried. I would have liked to see more of Zamperini's post-war PTSD struggle as this is such a relevant topic today, culminating with his will to forgive which ultimately saved him. For those who are only interested in Zamperini as an Olympian and POW, then you will appreciate this film. I found this film failed to address the full life of Louis Zamperini and felt his wikipedia entry would have been a better guide for Jolie."
"brentn3","2","129","199","28 December 2014"," Little / No Character Motivation or Progression
","!May contain Spoilers!<br/><br/>This movie does little beyond telling the story of Louis Zamperini - and it does so with a lot of missing details, no character growth, and contains little else than drawn out scenes of suffering.<br/><br/>The movie is very similar to The Passion of the Christ in that the film shows little progression except when the main character is shown suffering in some way. The characters shown in the movie, Louis and ""The Bird"" being chief among them, have little to no backgrounds, motivations, or growth / story arcs. <br/><br/>Louis is shown first as a troublesome child, then a youth learning to run, then an Olympian, and finally a soldier; between these scenes, however, there is no transition, no story about him deciding to go for the Olympics, and no story on whether he was drafted or voluntarily signed up to be a soldier. This results in the movie being very oddly paced and Louis having little substance to his background.<br/><br/>Louis, while suffering in the Japanese prison camp, is never shown thinking ""I can't do this"" or progressing to the point that he determines ""I will make it out alive no matter what."" He is simply tortured, repeatedly beaten and humiliated, and finally the war simply ends.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, no other prisoners or ""extras"" are shown being killed / executed at the camp, which does little to help show the brutality of their conditions. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie ends with written paragraphs on-screen which detail his life back in the US and how he forgave his captors. One of the biggest rules of film is to ""show them, not tell them,"" and considering that the written part of the story at the end contains more interesting parts of his life than most the movie, it seems the film was barely able to ""show us"" as well.<br/><br/>The source material for the movie; Louis's story, is extraordinary and exciting, its unfortunate that the movie does very little to give it justice."
"Screen_Blitz","6","11","14","28 March 2015"," An amazing story, great characters, but very slow paced
","Most people know Angelina Jolie playing in action movies. However, she takes the directorial path in this drama set in World War II. Jack O'Connell plays an Olympic track runner, who joins the army during WW2 in the pacific theater. When his crew face a tragic plane crash, him and his remaining crew members are stranded on life rafts, only to get picked up by the Japanese and sent to a prison camp. <br/><br/>This movie was entertaining at times, but I felt it could have been done better. It was very slow at times, to the point where I began to lose interest. However, the plot was so beautifully written that I could not take my eyes off the screen (until the end). On the positive side, the characters were quite amazing too. Jack O'Connell did a great job as the main character. I personally think I could have landed in Oscar. It was very upsetting to watch the character struggle through the Japanese soldiers' maltreatment. However, the settings were quite authentic and the way the soldiers smacked and brutally beat down the prisoners gave the film a sense of emotional realism. <br/><br/>Maybe this film would have been better if it was directed by Steven Spielberg or Clint Eastwood. All in all, the film wasn't bad and it is probably watching. However, I would not recommend this to children under 14 because it does pretty intense at times."
"sarahehallmark","1","148","254","25 December 2014"," What a waste of a good story.
","I cannot begin to list all the things wrong with this movie. Granted the acting was very good, however, it was the longest 2 hours of my life. I kept waiting for something 'good' to happen and it never did. I believe this could have been a wonderful American story, but was nothing short of a huge let down. Really disappointed in how much this movie was hyped up. Painfully slow, and felt like two hours of literal purgatory. I am sure that his true story was much better and could have emphasized what his family was going through at the same time. Or possible they could have shown what the news had reported about him, and what the airforce was doing to look for him. Wish I could erase this one from my memory. The worst part is I feel this man was done a real disservice to his memory and honor."
"rockslideproductions","5","176","321","13 December 2014"," It's Fine
","Just came out of a pre-release screening. It was fine. Above all, the word I would use would be ""safe"". It was a movie created not to fail, and it doesn't. Watching it is a reasonable way to spend 2 and a half hours. A bunch of bad stuff happens to Zamperini, he survives it in an inspiring way, the end.<br/><br/>IMDb movie reviews have to be 10 lines, but Unbroken doesn't really deserve it. There's more to be said about Zamperini the person than the film itself. It was narratively predictable, but that's forgivable given the nature of the film. The problem is it was visually predictable too. If someone were to right a textbook on how to make an inspiring movie, they could dryly and apathetically describe this movie shot for shot. So...hoorah I guess. It was fine."
"rebeccaspurlock","7","50","84","25 December 2014"," Jack O'Connell is outstanding..
","Lets just say I just saw a great movie about loyalty, courage, survival and redemption. Angelina Jolie has fantastic directing skills and its Oscar worthy. Jack O'Connell knocks his performance out of the park and he's proved himself with this great performance along with his performances in ""Starred Up"" and ""'71"". He embodies the characteristics of Louis Zamperini and the great wonderful life he lived. Jai Courtney had a small role, but really good surprisingly, can't wait to see him as Kyle Reese in next summer's Terminator reboot. The movie slowed at a point but picked it up and blew me away, O'Connell gives an Oscar worthy performance, but given the competition it's unlikely. Who cares though? This is one of 2014's best films and you'll see it at the Oscars I promise you that."
"dseesel-195-419072","6","57","97","26 December 2014"," A disappointment for this huge fan of the book
","I have been looking forward to this movie, having loved the book and admiring Louis Zamperini like so many others. While the movie was well-crafted and well-acted, it failed to blow me over emotionally. It's one movie that could have been longer, while at the same time tightening up the POW sequence by at least 15 minutes. <br/><br/>The director, editors and committee of screenwriters (never a good sign) cut out too much of the back story of what shaped Louie's character as a kid, and (critically) his PTSD and religious awakening at the end. I know this would have made Unbroken a three- hour movie but Louie's story deserved a fuller treatment. Instead, the character is turned into a Christ-like vessel of suffering for his fellow prisoners, rather than a flesh-and-blood person, although he seems oddly unscathed by the ordeal when he reunites with his family.<br/><br/>I was hoping for a ""Spielberg"" experience to leave me in tears, and it just didn't happen. Too bad."
"elainejergens","3","193","359","2 December 2014"," the award frenzy exceeds content
","Although it is an exceptional story in it's own right, the film fails to dazzle or inspire as the book did. It never fully materializes into the epic experience it wants to be. The script was problematic from the get-go. Attributing a mans extremely brutal POW experience with a spiritual awakening and strength in God does not translate well on the big screen. Blending those two subject matters together in a seamless way while maintaining the violent theme that the director imposes on the audience just doesn't work. This films tries to be too many things so naturally it fails to be anything. You cant please everyone.The buzz over the last two years promoting this film really boosted my expectations. Only to feel extremely let down and honestly, conned. Perhaps it was a lack of budget or the lack of talent behind the screen. On screen the talent was impressive and I think we have found a new budding star in newcomer Jack O'connell. Very impressive indeed."

","I finally rented this movie which I had been avoiding since it was released over a year ago. I am glad I did because it kept my interest throughout. I thought the POW theme would be too depressing which it is but there is no glossing over that. Angelina Jolie has become an admirable director. I don't understand the hate directed towards her. This is an epic movie that is very well done. The film has won it's fair share of awards including three Oscar nominations. The acting is great. I am surprised the movie didn't receive more Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Lead Actor, Best Supporting Actor & Best Director. Also the Coen Brothers should have received more recognition for their screenplay"
"jdesando","Null","46","78","24 December 2014"," Maybe his life is just not suspenseful. Not!
","Director Angelina Jolie has adapted Laura Hillenbrand's great biography, Unbroken, and made a conventional story about one of America's true heroes, Louis Zamperini. I'll continue to think about how Jolie could have made this more suspenseful, considering Louis was an Olympic runner, stayed in a life boat for the world record 47 days, and survived torture in two Japanese POW camps.<br/><br/>Although the film shows Louis to survive unbroken, despite the-Passion-of-The-Christ-like torture overdose, and follows his life story accurately, there's no soul, just dutiful recounting of the separate incidents. As a colleague commented, the real life footage of Louis returning as an old man to run the Olympic torch is more engaging and emotional than the whole film.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the renowned Roger Deakins is splendid on land and sea while Alexandre Desplat's music swells with romance at the right times. Otherwise, it's business as usual—get the history right. For me, a filmmaker could play with the story to make it more meaningful and involve more emotion if she has to—and Jolie has to.<br/><br/>The mediocre writing, that includes work of the Coens and the screenwriter of Gladiator, William Nicholson, repeats this trite line, ""If you can take it, you can make it."" Also this line, ""One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" doesn't sound right, whereas in the book, it does: ""A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain."" Now that makes sense.<br/><br/>The villain, called Bird, should be a ruthless torturer with emotional issues tied to his lack of promotion and homosexual longings. However Jolie has chosen an androgynous Japanese rock star, Takamasa Ishihara, who doesn't click as mean or psychotic, just barking torture orders to fill his time with an occasionally enigmatic sentence or two to entice us into thinking we havedepth. Like the film, Bird promises much but delivers too little.<br/><br/>As opposed to the boring torture—how about more of his home life or his search for Bird after the war? I want Jolie to do well—she has an exemplary family and solid career as an actress—but, with the negligible first directing effort, In the Land of Blood and Honey, she has yet to achieve as a director.<br/><br/>""I assess the power of a will by how much resistance, pain, torture it endures and knows how to turn to its advantage.""

"billpappas-1","4","52","92","25 December 2014"," When more is less.
","How was it possible to make such an compelling and inspiring life story into such a boring movie despite sharks and torture? Go figure.<br/><br/>'Lifeboat' with Tallulah Bankhead was filmed almost entirely in a lifeboat and was much more interesting than the life raft scenes in this movie which felt like twice the length of the other movie.<br/><br/>Bridge on the River Kwai took place almost entirely in a POW camp and same comparison I made above could apply with this tedious hour or more of torture and abuse that was also boring.<br/><br/>And how did the lead character not have a full beard after 47 days at sea. His haircut looked the same throughout his adult scenes except for being messy at times. Did his hair stop growing? The movie seemed flat and 2 dimensional. There were only 2 moments that evoked any spark of emotion or interest in me- when he was in church as a young boy and got slapped upside the head for not paying attention and the epilogue at the very end showing the real Louie running in the Olympics at age 80 but that scene was real footage and not part of Jolie's overdone, overwrought and, yet, uninspiring and yawn inducing vanity project.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was the acting which was flat or the camera not capturing any good acting. Even closeups of Louie's face in excruciating pain or intense emotion stayed right there on the screen and didn't reach the audience. I actually heard laughter during some intense scenes. Huh? I've seen more moving teevee commercials than most of this movie was.<br/><br/>But, Jolie isn't the only one. Many current directors work so hard at 'realism' that it is distracting. The old time directors knew how to create magic on the silver screen without having to put every excruciating detail on film. It's like they want to put a clinical pelvic exam on a video for gynecologists instead of a truly romantic scene with fully clothed actors when romance is the intention.<br/><br/>Bette Davis was scarier as Baby Jane Hudson than the Japanese head of the POW camp.<br/><br/>I just don't understand how Jolie could get it so wrong. Didn't she learn anything from Eastwood's 'Changeling' that left me not caring about anyone in that movie, especially Jolie herself? Even the very short scene of Louie's reunion with his family was so so contrasted to the amount of time spent on the life raft and POW scenes.<br/><br/>It just didn't work and I hate being so critical of a movie based on such a remarkable and extraordinary long life. But, the movie didn't do Louie justice and that's as painful as watching the movie was."

","Just watched this filmed version of the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who eventually ended up at a Japanese prison camp during World War II, with my mom. We both were pretty shocked by the atrocious events that happened to him during that war especially that one Jap officer really torturing him in many scenes. Angelina Jolie really made quite a compelling account about his survival instincts and also his expert running during both high school and the Olympics of 1936. We also had a female cousin of mine visiting and she had to leave when it really was threatening to get intense. Also loved the footage of the real-life Zamperini running during the Nagano games of 1998 with the titles mentioning how he ended up forgiving the country where his tormentors were.

","I was very disappointed in what should have been, hands down, an Oscar contender. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone because the direction absolutely ruined this film, which misses the point of the book altogether. Laura Hildebrand's wonderful book immediately reaches the reader's heart as she connects Louie Zamperini's life story of growing up from a kid headed towards a life of crime to becoming a man who not only survived the most unbelievable odds but also how the human spirit can sustain anything, if wanted. Never during the two + hours does the viewer get to know the character, or his friends, family and comrades-in-arms. Maybe Ms. Jolie should have spent more time reading the book and trying to understand the emotional connect the book had with its readers than planning all her promotional interviews and short documentaries which focused only on her and how fortunate she was to have been chosen to direct the film. It's not about you, Angelina, it was about a remarkable life and humanity, and you missed it all."

","Unbroken tells the life of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who joined the armed forces in World War II and endured tortured until the end of the war.<br/><br/>Although Unbroken is the third film Angelina Jolie has directed, Jolie skillfully recounts Zamperini's life. The first half weaves in and out of Zamperini's childhood and life in the Japanese prisoner- of-war camp. <br/><br/>Some of the cinematography is gripping, such as the scene in which Zamperini and his friends encounter sharks while they're lost in the middle of an ocean. The opening shots of Zamperini's crew struggling to stay alive in their airplane immediately engage the audience. <br/><br/>Despite the occasional frantic scenes, the movie succeeds best by focusing on its plot, which is intellectually fulfilling. There aren't any extraneous scenes and the story is straightforward. However, I didn't feel emotionally connected. I was looking forward to watching Zamperini develop relationships with his friends during the war. But, there isn't much of that. The ending, which is when the war finally ends, feels a bit rushed and didn't feel gratifying. Most of the film centers on Zamperini withstanding suffering. Although Unbroken is rated PG-13, there are several violent scenes in which the protagonist is beaten. I recommend it for ages 13 to 18. <br/><br/>Jolie's storytelling conveys the themes clearly. Zamperini was known as a troublemaker during his childhood. Yet, he worked hard to become a great runner and eventually was good enough to enter the Olympics. After his crew's plane crashes, he manages to stay alive, even despite a brutal 47 days stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. When he's captured by the Japanese navy and is sent to a prisoner-of-war camp, he endures severe beatings. When he's presented the opportunity to live luxuriously in exchange for aiding the Japanese, he refuses. When the war ends, he forgives his World War II enemies and fulfills his dream by participating in a marathon in Japan. The themes of loyalty, determination, perseverance and forgiveness make the movie very relevant to today's society. As Lauren Hillenbrand writes in her book, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption, ""A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain.""<br/><br/>This inspiring movie is fitting for the holiday season.

","This film came out a few months ago, so by now there are quite a few reviews--so I'll try to make my comments brief. The film is a biography of the wartime experiences of Louie Zmaperini--as well as a few flashbacks to his life before the war. Zamperini was famous both for being an Olympic athlete as well as his being a prisoner of war in Japan--all of which he later wrote about in his biography. In it, he also talks about his difficulties coping with PTSD and anger towards his Japanese tormentors--as well as, with the help of God, he was able to let go of the anger and life a normal life. In many ways, this is extremely similar to another recent film, ""The Railway Man""--a film which, to me, is better and makes a much stronger emotional impact. <br/><br/>What what did I like and dislike about the film? The aerial sequences were pretty amazing--particularly how they used wonderful CGI to make it appear as if Mitsubishi Zeros were attacking a formation of B-24 Liberator bombers. The story also was very interesting. But the film also seemed to be missing the spiritual and emotional side--and mostly only talked about this in the epilogue which was written only. In many ways, interesting but curiously uninvolving at times."

","Angelina Jolie's directorial debut is far too ambitious. She obviously tried to win an Oscar for that one thinking all Hollywood WWII tales are instant award winning movies. The problem with Unbroken is that Angelina Jolie is a really bad storyteller. The movie drags for the first hour and a half, with the story showing how Zamperini survived in the pacific. While it is necessary to show how he survived the ordeal, the way Angelina told the story is boring and completely uninteresting. The cast is also lacking, and borderline amateurish, lacking any emotional impact on the viewers. Jack O'Connell (Zamperini) is not suited at all for the main role. The final scene in which he carries the heavy wooden log over his head is far fetched and borderline Hollywood fiction. Unbroken is ultimately broken on all parts. This 140 min motion picture is a pain to watch, and ironically the only redeeming parts remotely interesting to me was the final cut of the movie that shows the real Zamperini carrying the Olympic torch in Nagano's 1998 Winter games. Save your money and skip this one."

I ask in all sincerity, would a narrator not have made this movie 20 times better?<br/><br/>Think about it, someone to tell the story and emotionally attach you (moreso) to the characters would have done wonders for this picture. Unless you read the book I there was no way you really connected to the level that you needed to in order to truly feel the trials and tribulations Louis went through. There was such a deeper connection that needed to be made for this story to really grab hold of your soul, no way this film did it justice. <br/><br/>2 examples that I can give (although there are several) would be the failure to dive deeper into the psychological toll that repeated air raids would take on a man (I forget how many he went on but it was probably close to 50. The movie did not even touch on the statistics of how many airmen were lost, killed, or wounded in WWII (into the hundreds of thousands) or how many planes crashed or disappeared (over 50,000). Another example, the failure to more powerfully bond Louis and his family as well as show his struggle after the war. Butchered as I said. Terrible first showing of Angelina Jolie's direction, if this movie wins an Academy Award I will puke."

","The movie failed to inspire, motivate, or even entertain. Movie goers should get refunds for hoopla that ended in snoring. Wish them good luck on breaking even to make this waste of time. Jolie wont see funding for another movie after this one, thank goodness. The mediocre writing, that includes work of the Coens and the screenwriter of Gladiator, William Nicholson, repeats this trite line, ""If you can take it, you can make it."" Also this line, ""One moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" doesn't sound right, whereas in the book, it does: ""A lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain."" The villain, called Bird, should be a ruthless torturer with emotional issues tied to his lack of promotion and homosexual longings. However Jolie has chosen an androgynous Japanese rock star, Takamasa Ishihara, who doesn't click as mean or psychotic, just barking torture orders to fill his time with an occasionally enigmatic sentence or two to entice us into thinking we havedepth.

","I rate the movie as a weak five of ten. I felt like the Zamperini portrayed in the film wasn't convincing. And not to my surprise, the real story beats the sugar coated adaptation of it for the movie. To begin with, the young Zamperini wasn't a suicidal young teenager, he was a fighter, a young man who ended up bullying his tormentors. There are many spots in the movie where the real story would have made better sense, and actually would have made the movie so much better. Louis Zamperini was a colorfull fighter, at times somewhat of a antihero, in this movie he is portrayed as a very beigue lump of insipidness. I think Angelina and the team behind the movie got caught up in the hero aura of this great man, forgetting that the true story would have given us something much more than a fictitious hero, we would have seen a real one. The craft in pure movie-making would easily lay the foundations of a 8-9 rating, but the otious way the story has been beautified, just makes it bland.

Cue lots of interviews with Jackie boy along the lines of ""so what's it like working with Angelina ?"" along with hints the film was going to be a major contender at the Oscars . Of all the films from last year this was the obvious Oscar bait . So obvious in fact that there's an element it might have alienated the voters in to searching around in independent cinema for its winners <br/><br/>O'Connoll plays Luis Zamperini an American from an Italian immigrant family who becomes an Olympic athlete . While he's at the peak of his career war breaks out and enlists as a bombardier of a B-25 and finds himself flying missions in the Pacific where he's shot down and spends several weeks in a life raft where he's captured by a passing Japanese ship and put in to a brutal POW camp <br/><br/>This is the sort of movie that has the Oscar academy falling over themselves to throw awards at - an epic true life story of the triumph of the human spirit . Or rather it used to and for many years the Academy has been rather unpredictable and somewhat surprising in what its tastes are and what films they nominate and give awards to and there's a strong element in UNBROKEN that it's maybe trying a little too hard , almost as if it's looking at prospective awards ceremonies with sad puppy dog eyes pleading for prestigious recognition . There's also an element that nowadays the second world war is almost as well remembered as say The Napoleonic or Crimean wars and war films featuring WWII need to bring something a little bit different to the table such as the outstanding technical achievements of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN , the no holds barred war porn of FURY , or the post modernist lunacy of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS . In comparison UNBROKEN comes across as being traditional almost to the point of being painfully old hat <br/><br/>Not to be too negative UNBROKEN has a well structured screenplay by the Coen brothers , the sadistic brutally of the Japanese is emphasised , Roger Deakins once again shows us he's the best cinematographer working today and O'Connoll is Luis Zamperini and never thought for a second I was watching a young British up and coming actor playing an all American hero . That said it its motive with having one eye on awards means there's something missing that makes it an outstanding film and it's never better than being a competent tale about surviving against all the odds"
"cartermacleod","6","7","10","6 April 2015"," Interesting Story at First, but Falls Victim to Poor Pacing and Character Development
","Unbroken is the true story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who ends up in a Japanese POW camp in WWII. His story of survival against the odds is inspiring, but it would be more so if not for this clumsy adaptation. <br/><br/>The movie starts out interestingly enough, with Louis in a squadron of bombers mounting an attack in the Pacific. Then we flash back to his childhood and see him develop an interest in, and talent for, running, which saves him from a life of petty crime. The bomber makes it back to base, but is quickly called back out for a rescue mission with few repairs (another movie that shows the contempt the army seems to have had in WWII for the lives of low-ranking young men). Of course, the plane immediately breaks down and crashes, killing all but three on board. The three men (eventually two) and their fight for survival could have been an interesting movie in and of itself (a Life of Pi sort of thing), but that part of the story ends many weeks later when the men are captured by the Japanese and sent to a jungle prison, then eventually a prison near Tokyo. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is that all of this takes a lot of time, so that by the time he ends up in the main prison camp with his main adversary, The Bird, the movie is running out of running time. That leaves very little time for character development, especially of The Bird, who is the prison camp's commanding officer.<br/><br/>At one point, The Bird starts starts torturing Louis by making him hold a large price of wood above his head and ordering one of his men to shoot him if he drops it, an image that's featured on the poster. The Bird gets so angry when Louis doesn't drop it that he starts to beat him. Then, out of nowhere, he starts to cry. If we had spent more time with The Bird, we might have understood his motivation, but because we don't see him for more than a few scenes, he remains a mystery. <br/><br/>The movie ends on a positive note, with Louis coming to terms with his capture and eventually returning to Japan to run in the Olympic Torch relay. However, I can't help feel that this would have been much more powerful if we had better understood Louis' experience in the Japanese prison camp and we hadn't spent so much time on the raft and flashing back to childhood."
"Argemaluco","6","7","10","31 January 2015"," Unbroken
","I vaguely remember having heard Louis Zamperini's name regarding his Olympic fame, but I completely ignored his story as an allied bomber during World War II. His devastating experiences in combat and after having been shot down are certainly inspiring, and they undoubtedly deserved a film... but I think that the film Unbroken couldn't make justice to that story, because despite its solid manufacture, it isn't able to evoke an emotional answer on the audience. Besides, allowing myself some cynicism, Unbroken seems to have been designed to win Oscars, and that erodes the honesty of the film, which already feels cold and distant, even more... exactly the opposite of what we would expect in a film about ""the triumph of human spirit"". On the one hand, the absence of sentimentality and narrative frivolity denotes a considerable respect for the hardships suffered by the characters; but on the other hand, such lack of empathy ends up making the film a historical pamphlet which is informative and well produced... but hollow and forgettable. The performances are also a factor in that sensation of coldness. Jack O'Connell, Domhnall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund don't feel credible in their roles, and they can never transmit the psychological havoc of their characters' situation, or the internal struggle they had to go through. In conclusion, I appreciated the didactic intention of Unbroken, as well as its polished manufacture. This film didn't bore me, but it feels more like an impersonal History lesson than as an endearing and human tale. I can give a slight recommendation to Unbroken, even though I feel that having spent half an hour in Wikipedia reading about this story would have provoked the same effect on me."

Once can only image someone else's pain until they have walked in their shoes.

Never have I been more disappointed by a movie.<br/><br/>With such an exciting and inspiring story to work with, prior to seeing this movie, I scoffed at the reviews that said it was boring and repetitive. Yet by stretching the floating adrift at sea scenes out to seemingly real time and portraying basically every single tribulation from his running career and time as a POW in the same exact way, the makers of this movie managed to accomplish the impossible.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only light in the darkness that is this film was the acting of Jack O'Connell. However, Takamara Ishihara was not a good pick for the Bird. His role was the brutalist of the brutal; he reminded me of a fashionable teddy bear. While on the topic of casting, I'd just like to point out that in real life, there were two different copilots in the opening scene and the crash scene. Also, Mac was only in the second crew. In the movie, there was one copilot, and Mac was in both crews. Whether it was being cheap on casting or a lack of attention to detail, I feel like even the most minute disparity from the true story is inexcusable.<br/><br/>Lastly, I know the film was painfully long to begin with, but the ending was extremely weak. Even with the cliché, based on a true story, real footage ending, it still omitted how he coped with PTSD, how he found Christianity, and what happened with the Bird and the other officers. Overall, there was so much potential and so little performance."

Have an arc, which is a curved line and not a flat one... running from beginning to end which a film that just shows unrelenting episodes of misery, is. Now I understand what the critics were getting on about with Angie not talking or showing Louis' struggle with his inner demons and or how he dealt with them after the war. She did have that option. Lauren Hildebrand's book was very large and very comprehensive. In other words Angie had a wealth of material from which to make her choices from.. The choices she made here were unfortunate and call into question her artistic eye, as painful as that is for me to admit. She seems to be too much about the darkness to the point of being fetishistic about it. And now... I wished this film wasn't doing well. Now.... I wished this film had been shown in just a few theaters, failed and then silently faded from everyone's memory. Why? Because I fear its success (so far anyway) is going draw more and more focus and derision on both it and Angie, (she get's way too much of that already) and I can't say it won't be deserved. I could go on about other things but it would be just piling on. The ONLY positive thing I can say about this film and Angie is that she has essentially made Jack O'Connell into a star.

I would have liked to have seen the aftermath of what the soldiers had to go through because it dragged after a while and I struggled to stay awake. The inspiring Olympic athlete, Louis, was played well by Jack O'Connell and some of the scenes were extremely emotional. The actions scenes at the beginning of the film, seemed quite real and the whole look and feel of the movie was great but I just couldn't take the length of the whole thing. The scenes when they were eating the fish on the dingy and when Louis was constantly getting picked on by the prison warden, we're touching and it's hard to believe that they ended up in such a predicament because the plane was faulty. Anyway, I personally was expecting a better film from Angelina Jolie who had a great concept to work with so it has to go down as a disappointment from me.<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although I didn't real connect with this film, it made a healthy profit at the box office so there must have been people out there who enjoyed it. Jack O'Connell, who shot to fame after his great performance in Starred Up, really gave this movie his all with the different weight changes and the reactions to the impossible situations that he found himself in. The bravery that was shown when he turned down to read the message on the radio which made him return to the horrible prison camp, was amazing but the tempo of the film is quite slow. It is worth a watch, just to see what these soldiers had to endeavour and the scene at the end when the real Louis is running was great but for entertainment, it did let me down.<br/><br/>Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $162million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their epic war movies about an inspiring Olympic athlete who goes to war and ends up stranded at sea for over a month and then he gets captured by the enemy. 5/10"

","Biopics touch people in a way few other stories do. In the case of UNBROKEN the film detailing the life of Louis Zamperini, from childhood in Torrance, California where he was a problem child until his brother Peter challenged him in more ways than one (and who has the most memorable lines in the script) to encourage Louis to run until he not only became part of the school track team but also an Olympic Gold Medalist and ingrained in his the indomitable spirit sense that reigns throughout this story. From the Olympics Louis joins the armed forces during World War II, sustained fighter plane crash only to be afloat at sea with his two companions for 47 challenging days then captured by the Japanese and placed in prisoner of war camps where he endures the cruel harsh punishment POWs traditionally undergo. The story is well known because of the history books and because of Laura Hillenbrand's novel. <br/><br/>The screenplay is pasted together by Joel and Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson and the film is directed sensitively by Angelina Jolie. Louis is portrayed by Jack O'Connell and his two at-sea mates are played by Domhnall Gleeson and Garret Hedlund. They all give credible performances as do Takamasa Ishihara the head of the prison camps, and Jai Courtney and Finn Wittrock who play major roles while the lads are airbourne. <br/><br/>A point is made during this very long film that Louis tells God and Jesus that if he survives he will devote his life to their service – and then that is dropped somehow. The film does a fine job portraying the horrors of war, of prisoner of war camps, of the act of survival and in doing so it becomes a very moving experience. One wishes an editor would have been more sensitive to the prolonged sequences – at sea, in camps – but the film should have been made and we should never forget stories of truth such as this."

","Unbroken was a hard movie to watch because of the torture that Louie Zamperini was put under. When he was taken as a prisoner of war and stuck in a foreign country with the other prisoners of war, it really hurt me to see the way that the human race can treat another person. I think it is cool how at the end of the movie, it showed pictures and gave an update on Louie. For all that he endured, he went back to the people that tortured him and made amends with them. I loved how the movie ended on a semi-positive result even though it was kind of dark. Also, It put me at ease to know that he finally got to run the race he was training for, for so many years. Lastly, I really liked how the graphics and how realistic every aspect of the movie was."

","The only people who will like this movie are those who haven't read the book. Those who have read the book will leave the theatre wondering why the movie stopped when the war ended (although it was plenty long). Why didn't it follow Zamperini through his plunge into depression and alcoholism? But deep inside, the viewer will know why. Zamperini was saved from his post-war self destruction by turning to God to Whom he was reintroduced by none other than evangelist Billy Graham. The film makers must have thought that part of Zamperini's biography would be too cornball for movie goers so they told only the story of his physical survival and, sadly, not the many times more important story of the survival of his soul."

","i don't care if the guys who did the screenplay are famous Cohen brothers, nor do i care or pay too much attention to the director, a female actress who got too many demons in her past up to her present, okay? this flick just made me become a shaking-head zombie when i tried to watch it but failed after wasted 40 minutes of lifetime. first of all, the screenplay sucks big time! too typically formulaic with a lame and pointless storyline, with several guys occupied the big screen for nothing to tell since the brothers recognized by themselves at the very beginning to draft a nothing to tell story. so they used the typical and overly used format to stuff the beanbag of it, centered on one of the guys' childhood, boyhood, hometown, college years, competition, romance...whatever they could borrow from the already overly used stuff, including the kitchen sink and bathroom soap.<br/><br/>the air raid scenes when this stupid pointless film started doomed it to be a lousy film right away. the pilot and the co-pilot both looked overdosed with Valiums, they were two mummies, their dumb and dummy facial expressions only exposed that they were in a video mirage created in the movie studio, both looked so unnaturally calm and numb to the situation, two lousy actors led the way to start a lousy film already. then one more stupid scene came up: so many strategic bombers tried to bomb certain unknown target on an island(or whatever or wherever inland of japan?) occupied by japs. there were so many bombers ahead and around this particular bomber, yet none of the others hit the target until this particular bomber dropped theirs and hit right on the mark, then a huge explosion and fireball risen from the ground up. yeah, right, because the film was centered on this particular bomber and its crew, so the glory must be all tributed to this bomber and its crew, other bombers never hit the target, because they were just cosmetic make-up crap. then the typical air combat scenes continued, the .50mm caliber machine guns handled by this particular crew on this particular bomber hit and destroyed so many japs' 0 fighter planes, we heard the non-stop DaDaDaDaDaDaDaDaDaDaDadadadadadadadadadada machine guns bullets fired, fired and fired, but with no ejected shells littered around, while the major lead actor went through the cabin to encourage his crew members with such a calm manners, another guy taken too many Valiums? then the bomber got problem, then it went down and crashed into the ocean, some of the crew didn't make it but some of them survived on a raft, then sunburns, hunger, eating raw fish sashimi, then saved by the japs, became POWs, tortured by the japs, then because the guys were American patriots, they never been broken, they.....well, these crappy scenarios were already used thousand times by Hollywood and the British movies. although there are so many similar or even exactly the same ones, this one just turned out to be a one that absolutely unnecessary. i don't know why this film had to be made, for what purpose, or there's some special favor to be repaid to the playwright or this specific so-called actress-turn-director person. the whole nine-yard endeavor and making simply achieved nothing, a big NADA. the only bless we feel lucky is since everything became digital and computerized, we didn't waste the expensive films anymore. god bless Hollywood and those who so moronically wasted their money in big-Nada movies. everyday or every morning, we have to go to the restroom to relieve ourselves, but there's absolutely no need to ask us to relieve this kinda crap again and again. there's no point and very cruel and heartless."
"griffolyon12","10","26","55","10 December 2014"," Movie Review: ""Unbroken""
","I am always worried for actors when they try their hand at directing. For every Mel Gibson, Emilio Estevez, or Kevin Costner, there are countless others that try and just never seem to get a good handle on it. The biggest misconception that I think a lot of actors make is that since you're an actor you can direct actors better, and while that may be true, they're ignoring a lot of the other elements that make great directors. A director needs to not only be able to work well with actors, but they also need to have an ability to lead, to be able to see the bigger picture, and most importantly, to create the visual language of the movie. It's this last one that I feel a lot of actors trying their hand at directing struggle with the most. Fortunately for Angelina Jolie, she manages to prove that she is a very adept director with a strong visual style to go with her ability to work with actors. Her second film as a director, Unbroken, is as good of a film as any other director could make.<br/><br/>Unbroken tells the amazing true story of Louie Zamperini, an Olympic track athlete who was a bombardier in World War II. When his plane crashes in the Pacific Ocean, his arduous journey begins. From being adrift at sea, to being a POW in a Japanese prison camp, Louie's journey is one of discovering extreme inner strength, perseverance, and ultimately the ability to forgive through faith in God. Simply put, this is the type of film that is rarely getting made anymore, and it is the sort of movie that even 15 years ago would have swept the Oscars, but cynicism and political correctness rule today.<br/><br/>What strikes me most about Unbroken is just how powerful it is through showing us very little about Zamperini other than his service in World War II. While there are a few flashbacks highlighting his childhood and his accomplishments in the Olympics, probably 95% of the movie is all about his experiences lost at sea or as a prisoner of war. It is through this crucible that we learn more about who Zamperini was, tying into the best line of the whole film, ""If I can take it, I can make it."" In so many ways, that's one of those sayings that perhaps everyone should live their life by. Louie did, while he had his moments of doubt and fear, he ultimately remembered those words when times were at their worst, and he managed to come out the other side.<br/><br/>The cast of up-and-coming actors all deliver exceptional performances and really dedicate themselves to these roles to make this film believable. Japanese pop star, Miyavi, is malicious and so perfect as, ""The Bird,"" the officer in charge at Louie's POW camp, and it's a shame that a year after Barkhad Abdi managed to find critical love for a similar type of role, Miyavi doesn't seem to be having as much luck with awards. Of course, a film like this needs actors you can root for if you are to buy their struggles, and more importantly, actors that go that extra mile to sell the reality of a true story such as this. Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson, respectively playing Louie and his friend Phil, both lost tons of weight to make the impact greater when they are forced to strip down in front of Japanese soldiers and you see their sunken stomachs and sallow cheeks. That type of actorly commitment only comes when you have a director you can trust and when you know you are working on a great story, and that is exactly what Unbroken is, it's a story that anyone who is a human being can relate to and be moved by.<br/><br/>I often think of watching movies as therapy. A good movie is always therapeutic for me, whether it's a story that makes me think differently about a particular subject like friendship or war, or whether or not it's simply a movie that makes me laugh or feel good. Movies are great for when I need inspiration to go do something, or reminders of the important things in life. Unbroken is one such movie that is a therapeutic experience. It is expertly crafted and superbly shot. Cinematographer Roger Deakins utilizes natural light in some truly stunning ways, and the shot design that Angelina Jolie employs in a lot of the action scenes had me thinking that she should make an action movie, her direction was that clear and concise. It's PG-13, so it's a little bit more tame than a lot of similar movies. Now that doesn't mean it is not rough, but a lot of the worst stuff is more implied, making this a great film for families of high school kids and above. Simply put, Unbroken is one of those movies that I just think everyone has to see, because if you walk away from it and haven't been moved, then there might be something seriously wrong with you."

"randolphpat","6","2","2","27 November 2015"," The Three In One War Epic
","With predictable plot turns and actors straight out of central casting this film, while beautifully presented, suffers from what appears to be hatchet job in the cutting room. <br/><br/>The story of a first generation Italian American Olympic athlete, turned war hero just tries to be too much. We begin with a bad boy in 1930s Southern California, who narrowly avoids reform school by finding his talent as a track runner. After a good showing in the Munich Olympic Games, our protagonist enlists and finds himself over the Pacific in a B52. <br/><br/>The crew encounters trouble when forced to use a shoddy plane to complete it's mission, and crashes with the help of some bullets from a Zero attack. In a short scene with stereotypical fly-boys getting shot up and dying in a dramatic fashion, engine failure forces a water landing in shark infested waters and only three survivors climb aboard lifeboats.<br/><br/>This, if properly done could have been a movie all by itself. But this condensed version really doesn't work. The audience never has the chance to get to know this plucky crew and really has no reason to care about them. <br/><br/>Next we have a long battle with the elements and a lack of food and fresh water as the three, who soon become two, languish in the open sea for a month and a half. Again we have a whole movie here if done well. But this portion attempts to pluck at nonexistent heart strings and we just are left waiting for what comes next.<br/><br/>What comes next is our third movie, as the two enfeebled men are taken aboard a Japanese ship and tossed into an internment camp for the rest of the war. A mean spirited Japanese Sargent beats our man mercilessly as he successfully maintains his integrity and never allows the Japanese to use his celebrity to their advantage. <br/><br/>There you have it, three movies rolled up in a little ball splashed across the screen in two hours. One gets the impression that Angelina Jole Pitt had a lot more to say about this man, but lost a war with the studio to keep the film to the current two and a half hours standard maximum.<br/><br/>What we do have is a fresh, first person perspective, dead on sets, good sound, lighting, and beautiful photography. In fact rarely does a period piece get presented better than this one. Ms. Jole Pitt may have lost the battle for editorial control, but she still gave us a film that looks, sounds, and feels so good it's worth watching in spite of monumental shortcomings."
"phd_travel","10","11","20","5 February 2015"," Very well done - from air to sea to land
","This true WWII movie about runner Louis Zamperini feels like several movies in one because a lot is covered - from the air to the sea to the land. So things are kept interesting throughout the 2 hours. Angelina Jolie did a fine job - don't understand the negative criticism. She puts the viewer very much in the place of the protagonists and shows what you need to see with just enough detail. The screenplay by the Coen Brothers is surprisingly lucid. Firstly there is an exciting plane battle which puts the viewer right in the vulnerable position of the crew. The story of Louis's running is inspirational. Then there is the survival in the sea on life rafts for many days. Situations like this have been shown before but here it is particularly well done. Finally the conditions at the prisoner of war camps. There is a lot of brutality shown, more so than previous movies like the recent 'Railway Man'. Can feel for each beating. The production values and technical aspects are top quality.<br/><br/>The acting by Jack O'Connell is winning and convincing. He may not look very Italian even with the dyed black hair, but he gives a moving performance. The weight loss the actors had to endure is painful to watch. The actor playing the sadistic Japanese prison guard looks a bit androgynous - someone more menacing and masculine looking would have been better choice.<br/><br/>This is a moving and harrowing movie that is well made deserving of more Golden Globe and Oscar nominations than it received."

I really can't fault his performance.

","This is not a truly bad film, so wont leave you feeling like you just lost two years of your life you will never get back, but you do leave with a sense of ""pointless"" coming to your mind.<br/><br/>The movie does not have any big hitting names that will instantly grap the attention of cinema goers, but the acting, although not Oscar winning, was probably the best thing of this film by far. You do get little taste of what could become of some of the actors, so ones to look out for in the future, especially the lead.<br/><br/>What lets this film down seems to be the script and direction. Yes the movie may be based on an interesting tale of an Airman and PoW in WW2, but excluding the part of being an Olympian, its really a tale heard many a time from the many grandfathers of my generation who likewise were maltreated PoW to the Japanese.<br/><br/>The movie tries to focus in on the fighting spirit and determination of the human soul, however following a lost at sea fight, it seems it just tries to show these aspects from the various facial expressings during physical beatings. There does not seem any depth to the characters true emotion and feelings, other than a one liner ""I want to kill him"".<br/><br/>As the film progresses you just instantly know that another beating is coming, and you so eagerly want to just get it over with so you can move on in the hopes that something further will unfold. However as an audience it's like you are just experiencing some sort of Stockholm syndrome and you just come to expect the beatings - feel nothing - and just want to wait for the next one.<br/><br/>As time further progresses the only thing that starts to come to mind are the various ways you feel for the character and how you would like to kill the Japanese camp leader who has obvious spoilt-child / father issues and just wants to make everyone as miserable as he is. You keep wanting something more to happen, thinking ""this is the time the camp will be liberated"" and wanting to hear the crack of a snipers bullet flying towards Birdman's head, bringing the roar of sound as the karma balance begins in the universe. But nothing! It's like the paper ran out so the last page read ""War ends"".<br/><br/>The real story here, despite it being a film so keen to show the spirit of humanity, is that NOTHING happens to make amends. The war ends, PoWs return home, suffer PTSD and the only hope of lasting justice in the good vs evil / Kharma balance is that the Birdman hides for a few years only to be later ""Let off"" scott free in the interest of American / Japan relations! And after all its the beaten up runner who has to do all the forgiving. So you leave the cinema thinking ""whats the point!"". Its not a bad way to pass 2 hours, but you could better spend your time reading a whole range of accounts from PoWs who had things just as bad, if not worse, but unfortunately did not have the privilege of being a ""non-champion, but good participant Olympian"""
"Chrispannell10","6","16","32","11 December 2014"," Survival, Resilience, Repetition
","I was given the chance to attend an advance screening of Unbroken a few nights ago. Having done a little reading up on Louie Zamperini over the past few months I was very excited to see it on the big screen. The movie starts off rather great, I loved the first half and greatly enjoyed watching Louie interact with family and war time friends. Unfortunately for the movie goer things go down hill pretty fast. <br/><br/>Eventually the movie turns into a big mess of ""Louie is in one place where he gets beaten up... until he moves to different place to get beaten up."" This continues for a very long time. I thought the scenes were all filmed extremely well, but the repetition soon over shadows any attempt at a story or character development. I understand that this was pretty much what Louie went through and I was beyond grateful that it was included in the film... to NOT include it would have been a great injustice. I just wish they would have done something with it. <br/><br/>For a movie that uses the tag line ""Survival, Resilience, Redemption"" I was hoping for way more in the area of character development. When the movie finally reaches its end we get some summery text recapping the rest of the characters lives... which tell of the redemption talked about in the tag line. My complaint is that this is really the only way you know about redemption taking place... from watching the movie there really isn't a whole lot of that happening. Throughout the movie you see tons of survival and resilience but if you were to stop watching the movie before the screen goes black and the summery text comes up you wouldn't know anything about his redemption. I felt this was a missed opportunity. <br/><br/>Regardless, the movie is a very enjoyable experience. I thought most of acting was great, especially Takamasa Ishihara. visually the movie was well done and the makeup was fantastic. Definitely worth seeing eventually, but I would skip the theaters and wait for the rental."
"maarvarq-1","1","15","30","26 January 2015"," Terrible, shallow attempt at emotional manipulation
","Let's start with a positive. The cinematography is magnificent - this is a very pretty movie. I will infer another positive, that Angelina Jolie took the principle of ""Show, don't tell"" to heart ... a bit too much. Now for the negatives, of which there are many. The major one is of course that the movie, at 135+ minutes, is FAR too long. The protagonist is a very pretty cipher, with no discernible internal life. His flirtation with hard liquor during childhood flashbacks had no reason (when asked why he was doing it, he said ""I don't know"" - end of story) but to give him something to 'overcome' by the discovery of his sporting ability. The character is passive for 90% of the movie - e.g. he only becomes a sports star because his brother nags him into it. The only reason given to the audience to sympathize with him is his sporting prowess, which comes to him with no discernible effort - his only appeal is to people who think that ""sporting hero"" is an oxymoron.<br/><br/>No bad thing that happens to him for the entire movie has any lasting consequences, i.e. <br/><br/>-being fouled in a race early on doesn't even stop him from winning that race; <br/><br/>-after 45 days at sea, untold months in Japanese POW camps and being punched in the face by every other prisoner in one camp, he still looks like he's just stepped off the set of a fashion magazine;<br/><br/>-at one point he's thrown down several meters onto a hard surface by a guard. He limps for a couple of scenes but is otherwise fine.<br/><br/>Neither do any of these events have any discernible psychological impact.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the long bombing raid scene at the start could have been cut from the movie with no effect on plot or character development. The dramatic film score fell flat with obvious attempts to induce emotions in me that the actual film had dismally failed to set up. <br/><br/>Finally, we are given the lead character's future struggle with PTSD, redemption and trip to Japan for reconciliation with his former enemies, i.e. the most interesting part of the story, as a few throwaway lines of text. Presumably the lead actor, a veritable block of wood, couldn't have conveyed that drama."

Now THAT should have been the focus of the second half of the movie, not a continual series of indignities under the hands of his captors, who were portrayed as no more than standard movie cliché villains.

","Unbroken opens with an extended sequence of a bombing run by a US B-17 crew against Japanese targets in the Pacific, and the subsequent attack on the bomber by a squad of Japanese Zero fighters. This aerial combat sequence is one of the most harrowing of it's kind I have ever seen. You actually feel like you are in that plane experiencing that terror and exhilaration first hand. This segment cannot be over praised, it is that good. Another sequence in a bomber, where the plane experiences massive engine failure and crashes into the sea with the crew all on board is also very well done. The flashback segments on Zamperini's running career are also fine, the extended sequence depicting three airmen's time on a life raft floating in the middle of the Pacific ocean is well done. So far it's all good. <br/><br/>Then we get to the meat of the film, the prisoner of war scenes, and the film becomes a ponderous slog through torture and brutal beatings of the main character by an effeminate and sadistic Japanese captor. This is essentially the entire second half of the film, and it becomes monotonous and numbing. <br/><br/>The photography, sound , and music in this film were all award-caliber, and Jolie shows great promise as a mainstream director."
"trublu215","6","17","37","2 December 2014"," A slight disappointment
","Unbroken tells the life story of Louis Zamperini, former Olympian turned World War II POW and does so with some grace but ultimately falls victim to its own hype. Angelina Jolie directs this brutal and inspirational story of Zamperini and his struggle to survive in a Japanese POW camp after he is shot down over the Pacific and presumed dead. This story is so inspirational, it will bring tears to your eyes especially with the charisma and precision that Jack O'Connell brings to the role. The issue here is the screenplay. The film focuses so much on the brutality that Zamperini faced that it is hard to remember any other scenes outside of the torture that this man endured. Zamperini is portrayed as a determined, defiant force, challenging his captors at any chance he can. It is mesmerizing to think that this man overcame so many odds and survived so much and we had to wait this long for a film about his life. It is a truly amazing story that deserved a better screenplay that doesn't wallow in strictly the brutality that this man faced. Jolie proves that she can direct her actors and she does this brilliantly. O'Connell is a star in the making, starring in this year's prison drama Starred Up and now with Unbroken, he is an actor with a rage inside of him and he is destined for greatness especially after seeing this film. His performance ranks among the best of the year. The supporting cast includes Garrett Hedlund, Domhnail Gleeson, Jai Courtney and the magnificent Miyavi, each of them deliver fantastic performances. Garrett Hedlund as John Fitzgerald is a huge leap for the supporting actor and proves that he can rise to the occasion to shine. The screenplay written by the brilliant Coen Brothers is a surprising misfire as I said before. It stays on the brutality of the POW camp and struggles to move around POW movie clichès and it doesn't always work especially throughout its two hour plus running time. By the end of the second act, Unbroken loses its steam and becomes somewhat of a talk fest that doesn't mount up to anything remotely thought provoking. Roger Deakins, a frequent Coen brothers collaborator also turns in some lackluster cinematography that, in comparison to his other work, is bottom of the barrel and by the book. It looks more like a Clint Eastwood film with its monochrome look and doesn't do the film justice. Jolie does her best with a script that could have easily had more of a punch but she makes it work and turns in a decent film filled with great performances. Overall, it is a bit disappointing due to the hype that was behind it but, above all else, Jack O'Connell's performance is the perfect way to honor this brave, tough and brilliant man known as Louis Zamperini."
"crashburnwinston","7","9","17","26 January 2015"," Jolie can and will get there, here is what needs work in the meantime
","To start with the good: Angelina has a beautiful photographic eye paired with a strong sense of pacing in the way she edited her shots as well as timing in the way she had the actors deliver their lines. The combination of these factors gave us both touches of visual nostalgia and of understated realism that removed us from the typical Hollywood schlock and elevated the experience to something that at certain points felt divine. The opening sequences are gorgeous and well paced and there are many shots through out the film that are beautiful. She chose a tremendous actor (Takamasa Ishihara) to play ""the Bird"" and he made the character's intensity and motivations palpable. Domhall Gleeson as ""Phil"" was also a great choice. While a lot of people had trouble with the slow and endless torture scenes, I personally did not. I found these sequences and their drudgery necessary in order to explain how much this man was tested. The film felt more European or Japanese in tone in these parts, and if it were black and white, parts of it could have easily felt like French or Japanese New Wave cinema. And, in part, this is some of the problem, Jolie's film was really three films in one- a Hollywood war film, an art film and a sentimental biopic and for this reason the directorial motivations are disjointed which left room for error. I walked away wondering if this was a humble biopic about her friend, Louie, or a film meant for an Oscar? If this was a film meant to be a humble biopic, then it is perfect. It is a sweet retelling of what her friend went through and it is filled with love and integrity, but if it was meant for an Oscar several things would have to change to get it there. First, the choice of Jack O'Connell is wrong, or at least what he gave to us was wrong. What we needed was a feisty Italian. We needed to see how the very thing he was persecuted for as a child (being Italian) gave him the sense of charisma, grit and passion to survive his circumstances. We needed passion and fire, we needed to fall in love with him. What we got was someone too contained, cool, and detached from his feelings for us to get close- we liked him, but we couldn't emotionally invest in him at the level we needed to. His containment backfired in the film, because the character needs to first overcome himself before he can overcome everything else and we did not feel that he developed in this way. Imagine for a moment if Joaquin Phoenix was in that role. That very charismatic, passionate man can make his audience feel heaven and hell because he feels it first- he is entirely committed to torturing himself on our behalf - this intensity is what we needed here in my opinion. I think O'Connell has the talent to get there, but I don't feel he did get there for some reason. I also believe there needed to be more character development in the ""young"" Louie. If the point of the piece is that he learns to be a great Olympian (and subsequently a great soldier) from his brother who sets him straight after he experiences discrimination and hardship, I wanted to see him do more than smoking and drinking in reaction to it. I want to feel his sense of longing to fit in and his frustration at not fitting in which motivated him to be bad. I wanted to feel what personal obstacles he had to overcome that made him strong enough to endure what he went through in the war. If clear motivations and character development had been more strongly established in the beginning, then we would have been rooting more for him when he was in the camps and out at sea. Instead he was sort of ready-made and well adjusted without a lot of struggle. Sure, his brother gave him a few words of advice and taught him to run that wasn't enough for us to root for him. We needed to feel that INTERNAL struggle. This would be much deeper than a bunch of bullies hitting him- this would have started before they ever did. This lack of struggle made his character and his motivations a little flat when we see him later in the camps. What we need to see is that he survived the first round of bullying as a child, and we know how he did that- by becoming a great Olympian and now he's going to survive these new bullies in the camps because he's a great Olympian. We needed to connect all the dots to figure out how he survived. There were also little things that took this down from Oscar level. The serif font selections weren't my favorite and I had wished we didn't see the dates when they were out at sea. What we needed was to FEEL the time out at sea, not be given the dates. There is also too much exposition at the end which took it away from Oscar potential and put it into pure biopic or scrapbook and too much in Jolie's head. As much as it warmed my heart to see Louie run the Olympics at 80, I had to question the pairing of a Cohen Brother's script with these final inserts- a simple title telling us he did this all of this may have been better than the footage and pictures- or better yet, make the story about him returning to Japan to forgive his captors- that part of the story is what intrigues me most and dovetails the most with Jolie's message. Jolie is a beautiful and awesome person, if she keeps working on her directorial abilities she will get there."

My only thought after seeing the short about the ""real"" Louis is that another movie could have been made about the rest of his life. What a remarkable person. As far as the movie, it was well done in almost every way with flashbacks bringing us up to date while we watch the incredible events take place. It has the classic good guy and bad guy conflict in gritty detail with a satisfying finish.

"moonspinner55","6","5","8","9 May 2015"," Emotionally solid, technically marvelous WWII drama...but with a thick layer of masochism
","In 1920s California, juvenile delinquent Louis Zamperini shows an early talent for track and field, eventually making it to the 1936 Olympics held in Berlin, but his endurance as an athlete is nothing compared to the physical tortures he endures as a bombardier during WWII. After surviving a plane crash in the ocean and being lost at sea for some 45 days, Zamperini and a comrade are captured by the Japanese, where they are interrogated and brutalized. Director and co-producer Angelina Jolie does a fine job bringing Laura Hillenbrand's non-fiction book ""Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption"" to the screen, with the gripping aerial action at the beginning particularly stunning. However, once Zamperini is blindfolded and led off to a POW camp in Tokyo, the movie becomes a checklist of masochistic horrors, complete with a sadistic Japanese sergeant portrayed in the same hissable manner as the Indians in an old Republic Pictures serial (with Jolie doting on actor Miyavi's smooth, unfeeling face). The entire second-half is an unending series of brutal, degrading humiliations which, though based on a true account, are not at all enlightening, varied or entertaining. We never get to know the victimized men holed up in this camp--they have no personalities--although Jolie and her scenarists are certainly adept at displaying their agonies and suffering. Strictly on a filmmaking level, ""Unbroken"" is a handsome, serious piece of work with fine performances and deeply-felt emotions at the finish line. **1/2 from ****"

"Likes_Ninjas90","4","8","15","12 January 2015"," It's not pride or liberation we feel but deep artistic constraint
","Unbroken is so tightly screwed together by a conga line of big names and reputations we wonder how it could fail. It is a World War II biopic about Olympian runner turned fighter pilot Louis Zamperini. It's Angelina Jolie's second directorial effort, with a screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen and photographed by multiple Oscar nominee Roger Deakins. For all its talent, Unbroken is a failure of overconfidence. It's so sincere about honouring Zamperini's tenacity and trusting in its ability to move us it never digs into moments between the violence but skims complacently along the brutal edges of its hero. Learning the most definitive moments of Zamperini's later life haven't made the cut also makes this survival story less distinguishable. The thematic and political goals it explores aren't insightful or unexpected either but typical of films manufactured to inspire rather than allowing us to discover these emotions ourselves. <br/><br/>Opening the film is a well-constructed action sequence onboard a fighter craft. Zamperini (Englishman Jack O'Connell) is one of the fighter pilots. He and the other crewmen (including Jai Courtney) shoot down the enemy fighters and survive this first encounter. The film flashes back to his childhood. Zamperini hails from Italian immigrants, struggling to be accepted in America. Zamperini doesn't pay attention in Church and is picked on by other children. To keep him out of trouble, his brother involves him in athletics and running races. This film is either oblivious to clichés or doesn't care. His brother motives him with cornball lines like ""If you can take it, you can make it"" and ""a moment of pain is worth the glory of a lifetime"". Likewise, the racing scenes are filmed in ways which could never surprise us. Consider this set piece: Zamperini is losing his race. The film cuts to his family nervously listening to the radio. The commentators tell us he won't take home the glory. Out of nowhere, Zamperini lays down his afterburners to win. Should we be surprised? It's far more interesting to know Zamperini met Hitler at the games in real life. <br/><br/>Neither Jolie nor the script view Zamperini as someone worthy of a personality, but a symbol of Western individualism. We're encouraged to reel in horror at Zamperini's physical torture, the end of Democracy as we know it, and uplifted by his resistance to defeat. The obviousness of Jolie's techniques, the fall then rise, never overcomes a monotonous transparency or that we're asked to feel for a symbol before a person. This isn't to say the film is devoid of suspense or craftsmanship. Jolie's experience playing action stars filters into confidently structured sequences, including the aircraft scene and when Zamperini and two other soldiers, including Russell Allen Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson), are stranded in a life-raft for forty-seven days. Surrounded by sharks, the men catch fish from over the side of the raft and eat the raw meat. At the screening some jumped when one of the sharks emerged, gnashing its teeth, a predictable but exciting moment. But in this long sequence, strongly framed using long shots to express the isolation, the time is misspent. The script is completely lacking in personality traits and characterisation for either Zamperini or Phillips besides their endurance and some traces of faith. <br/><br/>Once Zamperini and Phillips are captured by Japanese soldiers and imprisoned, Unbroken isn't shaped by a plot or relationships but brutal, violent episodes, derivative of countless other enslavement films. The most confronting image here isn't a beating but seeing Phillips' starvation upon removing his shirt. It's a terrible sight without the film overplaying its hand. But the psychology between prisoner and warden is overly simplistic and obvious. Zamperini represents Western individualism and loyalty to American values. In one rare scene outside the camp he refuses to continually discredit America on radio and is sent back to be tortured. His ideological counterpoint Mutsushiro Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara), otherwise known as the Bird, is fascism personified. He extracts punishment and repression via a bamboo stick. Attempts to round this monster are frivolous. He tells Zamperini they are friends but he is an enemy of Japan but the line is recited with such overt menace we don't sense a deeper connection between the two men. Some Japanese nationalists have called Unbroken's representation of Asians racist. The Japanese soldiers were merciless to their prisoners. This is factual. But films like Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima have humanised Japanese troops in such a way that Unbroken's characters look comparatively old fashioned and one-dimensional.<br/><br/>The film's major confrontation, intended as a set piece of triumph, summarises the dramatic phoniness and ideological flaws. Zamperini is ordered at gunpoint by Bird to pick up a heavy beam and hold it over his head. If he drops it he'll be shot. Bird waits, expecting him to fail and Zamperini to die. In this sequence Zamperini mirrors Christ, carrying the beam like the Cross. This is suitable, Zamperini was a Christian, until the film unknowingly characterises him in its own fascist, Aryanist lens. The supreme fitness of the American, his inhuman strength and willpower, leaves the Japanese officer stunned and diminutive. It's a climax so unsubtle and appallingly jingoistic it becomes unintentionally funny. The prison content might have been more tolerable if it hadn't entirely substituted the most interesting parts of Zamperini's story. The forgiveness of his captors, attributed to his faith, and his leg of an Olympic race at eight-one years old, aren't relayed dramatically but lumped in an end text summary. Zamperini was ninety-seven when he died last year and before his death Angelina Jolie showed him the film in hospital. By all accounts, they had a very close relationship, like a father and daughter. Due to their bond she's chosen one polite, safe angle for the telling story: the unwavering physical endurance of a single man. But for the wider audience, it's not pride or liberation we feel but deep artistic constraint."

He went on to survive and live a very long life, dying in 2014 at the age of 97, but this movie is specific to the war years. <br/><br/>Jack O'Connell plays Louis Zamperini who was born to Italian immigrants and as a young boy had a natural ability to run fast and actually represented the USA as a teenager in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. In his early 20s when WW2 broke out he was a bombardier in the Army Air Corps. Surviving hazardous bombing runs, a plane he was in went down at sea on the way to do a rescue. After 47 days at sea they were rescued, but by the Japanese and sent to prison camp.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is Zamperini's survival, ""unbroken"", during his two years in prison camp.

He was a brutal man and as this story goes he took a particular interest in the ""Olympian"" and took every opportunity he had to try to break him, but Zamperini always got up and continued on.<br/><br/>We are also told that Zamperini later in life returned to Japan and looked up as many of his captors as he could so that they could make mutual amends, but that Watanabe refused to meet with him."
"kaitlyncope","3","3","4","27 April 2015"," The fast and brave American solider
","Unbroken took place in World War 11. It was about a boy named Louis who beat the world's fastest running record for track. He was racing the rest of the men on the track and fell way behind all the other men. Louis ended up in front of all the track men being at fifty-six seconds top of the record and won. Louis and five other men were in a plane crash which was fatal. The plane crashed into the ocean only leaving Louis and two other men alive. Louis and two other men were able to get a raft to stay on so they would not drown. The two men and Louis ate anything that they could grab with their bare hands in the ocean. One of the men died who were on the raft. The men survived on the raft for forty five days. Louis and the other man got captured off the raft by Japanese men who were in the prisoners of war camp. The director's name of Unbroken is Angelina Jolie. Yes the actors were chosen well they all played important parts and know how to play them well. The actors both portrayed their characters realistically. Louis acted like he was part of the prisoner war camp and listened to every command. The other main character acted like he was only at the prisoner war camp to get beaten on. Unbroken did flow in an understandable way because Japanese hate Americans and that is what would happen if an American ever got captured by a Japanese and taken to a prisoner war camp. The flash back scenes did make sense. The flash back scenes were placed correctly throughout the movie. One example of a flash back scene in the movie was when Louis was at the prisoner camp and had a flash back about how his life was before he got captured. They added the music to the movie so that the movie could switch from different emotions. The movie had a lot of different emotions that made the movie even better. The story switched from being sad to scary and then to happy. The film backgrounds seemed realistic because some places in the world could look like that for example Iraq. It also could really happen in the world. Yes the costumes, hairstyles, planes, and the cabins were all appropriate for the time/place of the story. The movie played sad music when one of the men died on the raft. Also the movie played sad music when Louis got told that the Japanese were going to kill him. The movie played scary music when Louis got captured and put into a prison cell. The type of music that was being played when the guys were warming up in the prisoner of war camp was scary. You could hear happy music being played when the war was over. The music helped in the movie by telling the person what type of scene it was going to be by the tone of the music. The music in the movie made the movie more intense. One of the negatives in the movie was when Louis got beat in the camp because Louis raced a guy in the camp and lost. Another negative was when the men on the raft got trapped and had no help. Last was when he talked to his family on Christmas over a microphone but was not allowed to see or be with them. One of the positives in the movie was when Louis ran the race and bet the world's fastest running record. The length of the movie was just right. All the details were shown perfect or not better in the movie because the movie was a just right length. I would recommend middle aged or older people to watch this movie. The movie had a lot of violence in it that is why I would recommend this movie to middle aged or older people. Also I would recommend this movie to people who served in the military or interested in the war. Unbroken is a war movie so if you're interested or served in the military you may definitely like this movie. I would rate the movie Unbroken a three star movie. I would rate it a three star movie because some of the movie had harsh and violent parts. I don't think anyone should be put through so many beatings like Louis did and the other man at the prisoner of war camp."

","The timeless contract between director and cinema-goer is to make us care about the movie, to change our thinking in some way, to transport us, to make our lives better. Unbroken does none of these. In some ways, it is similar to Scorsese's Silence, which is two hours of unremitting medieval torture, or Iñárritu's Revenant, which was diCaprio grunting through snow for 2+ hours.<br/><br/>Jolie's Unbroken is a litany of Japanese cruelty and brutality. Up to a certain point, it shows how realistic WWII POW camps were, but this is not a documentary but a movie. It is meant, according to the unspoken contract mentioned above, to take the viewer on a journey, make him care about a character, see a character grow (even despite tremendous adversity), and give the viewer some kind of emotional cathartic satisfaction at the end.<br/><br/>In Unbroken, though, Jolie minimalises any character growth in a rather spartan ""show the viewers and let them figure out what is going on"" methodology. As a result, Zamperini, our lead character, simply exists from one scene to the next. He does not show any emotional growth arc whatsoever. He simply takes all the multifarious beatings his captors give him as though that were enough. Ms Jolie, it is NOT. We need to see a character move as an active participant in the story, as a maker of events, not a passive recipient. <br/><br/>To put it bluntly, here is the storyline (spoiler alert.)<br/><br/>Zamperini gets captured. He gets beaten often and mistreated. The End. <br/><br/>Sure there is a brief storyboard at the conclusion of the movie which fleshed out the character a little, but it is NOT ENOUGH. I suspect that Ms Jolie believed that the various scenes that she so treasured would trigger the same emotional responses in her audience as her, a sadly mistaken belief. Towards the end of the movie, I was badly needing Zamperini to DO something instead of just accept further beatings. We saw NOTHING of his internal journey, NOTHING of any form of resistance, NOTHING but an endless series of beatings and Watanabe, his tormentor, saying the same things over and over and beating him without any point at all.<br/><br/>The end, when it came, was a glorious relief, and I say that in a negative sense. Count this a failure, Ms Jolie. Do better next time, if there is a next time."

A long movie that seemed to fly by for me.<br/><br/>Everyone with an empathetic heart and open mind should watch this movie and you may feel a more humane and inspired person as a result."

"yerlo","10","14","31","5 January 2015"," I challenge the critical reviews
","Just being cautious on the ""spoiler"" issue. Don't think I have any given how well known the life story is for Zamperini. I'm disappointed in the the many reviews critical of the movie content, or, more accurately, the lack of content. Zam's war experience IS what did not break him. Not the life events before that, and, no, not the struggles he went through afterward, it was the many incredible near death events of crashing in the ocean and ending up in Japanese POW camps. <br/><br/>A movie can be made about his misspent early life and how he was saved from a life of crime then went onto to be an Olympic champion. That story been done many times. It can get old, and has all the predictability decried in some reviews here. Or, a movie can be made about his after-war struggles, how he got religion and saved his family & life as some reviewers are demanding. Oh, wait, that's been done many times and always predictably. You can find decades of those movies, and those are lives that are rather common, can happen to anyone. <br/><br/>But the war events that could have hammered Zmaperini into a miserable unsung death do not happen to just anyone. And those who are hit with such events often break (no disgrace) or die--or both. It was Zamperini's determination and stamina that got him through, an inspirational feat. He was UNBROKEN. That his war experience was bracketed by an inspirational early life and post-war life makes his life story particularly moving and inspirational. <br/><br/>I applaud Jolie for pulling out the key elements and honoring Zamperini with this film. Without beating a drum, she subtly wove in other themes. That warriors are courageous breed; that war is not romantic but demands the best a man can offer; that Japan was not was not a victim of America. But the shining beacon in this film is that a man endured this suffering and torment and came through UNBROKEN.<br/><br/>Our budding young ""men"" should see this movie."
"dierregi","1","7","13","9 May 2015"," One third raft, two thirds POW, three thirds waste of time
","It is a shame that the exceptional story of Louis Zamperini ended up on screen as such a mediocre film. The plot is roughly divided in two parts: the film starts during WWII, when Louis is a bombardier based in the Pacific. A few flashbacks show Louis as a difficult child, who started training as a runner to keep out of trouble and ended up competing at the Berlin Olympic games.<br/><br/>Within some minutes from the beginning, Louis plane crashes and one third of the movie is spent with him and surviving crew members adrift in the ocean for 47 days. Watching young people die of starvation is not particularly amusing. However, it can be assumed that this part drags on for what seems an eternity to give an idea of how those 47 days felt.<br/><br/>The remaining two thirds of the movie are about Louis being fished out by the Japanese and spending the rest of the war as POW, being constantly abused by Watanabe, the sadistic camp's commander. This part seems to drag on even longer and it is developed without any subtlety. Scene after scene Louis is beaten up by Watanabe but manages to retain some dignity. Unfortunately, witnessing the horrific conditions of POW is even less fun than castaways dying of starvation and the whole movie feels like an overlong torture, despite the final five minutes left for the - sort of - upbeat ending"

","Rarely, if ever, has a film made me keep my seat during the credits. Usually as soon as the screen goes dark, I'm looking to head to the exit. By the end of Unbroken, my mind was racing and I had witnessed a film which probably joins my top 10 favourite ever films.<br/><br/>I thought this was just a film about about an Olympian running the race. Rather it looks at Christianity and the importance of faith in the darkest of places, it looks at a personal, honest depiction of the horror or war and world war 2. Rather than looking at WW2 as classic films such as The Battle of the Bulge or The Longest Day have done, with black and white and characters and the stiff upper lip and righteousness of the allies. Unbroken provides a harrowing, difficult to watch, portrayal of Zambrerin personal suffering. It doesn't glorify war, rather at times I wished it would end, as the suffering and pain faced is so clear. At times you wish that it would all end, you are certain that Zambrerini will give in. Or die. At times I wished to shout at the screen, for him to kill the guard! Yet the constant theme is that through faith, that Zambrerini will endure. At times he is provided for miraculously when there is so little hope. Moreover in a conversation with a captain in the POW camp, Zambrerini is told that he through endurance they have victory rather than through revenge and retribution.<br/><br/>If all took an eye for an eye, the world would be blind.<br/><br/>'I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race.' 2 Timothy 5:7"
"ClaytonDavis","7","21","52","2 December 2014"," Angelina Jolie's inspiring epic features star-making turns by Jack O'Connell and Miyavi...
","Read more @ Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)<br/><br/>There are so many things to admire when looking upon Angelina Jolie's English language directorial debut. ""Unbroken"" checks most of the boxes of a great film. Inspiring, moving, and emotionally resonate, Jolie's epic lands on the back end of the film year and becomes an instant contender. Pulling out the big guns with legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins, and a Sound team that includes five-time Oscar nominee Frank A. Montaño (""Gladiator""), Emmy-nominee Jon Taylor (""Apollo 11″), Production Sound Mixer David Lee, BAFTA winner Becky Sullivan (""The Fugitive""), and MPSE Winner Andrew DeCristofaro (""To the Arctic 3D""), both technical aspects of the film are among the very best seen, and heard in 2014. ""Unbroken"" is an uplifting, daunting experience, telling the story of a man who fought against impossible odds to survive. A worldly film that speaks to so much happening today.<br/><br/>The screenplay, which went through three drafts by William Nicholson, Richard LaGravenese, and Joel Coen & Ethan Coen, is the film's biggest hiccup. The first half of the film is entrenched, marvelous even, focusing on the survival and story of Louis Zamperini. The Olympic story, as you'd expect, is secondary to our tale. Playing in flashbacks from Zamperini on a flight mission, then to his early days as a child, rambunctious and being inspired by his older brother to join the track team. Jolie focuses on the world around Zamperini in those early scenes. Introducing an Italian-immigrant mother, praying for her son's safety and guidance, along with a disciplinarian father. You have moments in those early scenes that call back to ""Forrest Gump,"" (still unsure if that's a compliment or not) but the visual aesthetics are well positioned by DP Roger Deakins. Gorgeous to look at 100% of the time.<br/><br/>The performances are fully developed. Jack O'Connell, as Louis Zamperini, provides another example of a killer breakout year with other performances in ""Starred Up"" and ""'71."" His dedication to the role is undeniable, losing weight, and managing to elevate some of the more stagnant scenes. He's an exciting actor to watch. Domhnall Gleeson's turn as Phil, Louis' ""boat-companion,"" is truly remarkable. I do wish we got a split story of Louis and Phil's journey. There's a beautiful dynamic that the two have, and that could have been explored. I think it's just a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is dominated by the aura and presence of Miyavi (or if you prefer Takamasa Ishiara) as the diabolical Mutsushiro Watanabe, commanding officer of the concentration camp where Louis is imprisoned. Just one year after Michael Fassbender scored an Oscar nomination for ""12 Years a Slave,"" a role that is similar in structure and similar by aura, Miyavi creates a multi- layered man, with so many things going on inside, aching for an explanation for the audience. Not everything will be answered, but he feels the most satisfying of every character on screen. A Supporting Actor contender has emerged in Miyavi. A breakout performance.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie has a firm hand on what is happening on-screen. Rumors have made their rounds that there is a director's cut, likely about 30 minutes longer. I have to imagine that if true, that is the version that feels more complete. The last quarter is problematic, rushed even, and I imagine that's where many of the cuts were made. Jolie's abilities as a filmmaker are way above par for a person on their second feature film. If we look at many director's second outings, I don't think you'd find to many as polished or confident as Jolie is behind the camera. She doesn't shy away from the brutality of the story. ""Unbroken"" is the most fitting title of any story delivered this year. Encompassing everything that this film is about.<br/><br/>Oscar race questions? Thought you'd never ask. Easy pick for a Best Picture nomination with all the crafts its likely to eat up including Cinematography, Film Editing, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, and a beautiful score by Alexandre Desplat. In a thin Adapted Screenplay race, the four-man writing team should find wiggle room, and in a just world, Miyavi should join the Supporting Actor contenders and score his first Academy Award nomination. Angelina Jolie will gain lots of respect for what she has constructed. If anything, this begins the narrative and excitement for her next feature ""By the Sea"" with hubby Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>""Unbroken"" is a fascinating deconstruction of a man beaten to his core. An enlightening story, featuring star-making performances, and an abundance of masterclass filmmaking techniques. The Oscar race continues."

"Robert_duder","6","6","11","10 January 2015"," Gives you the meat and potatoes but forgot to heat them up
","I felt somehow vindicated when the first review on IMDb I saw was from a user who said exactly what I felt. This is a powerful and inspiring story but poorly adapted for the big screen. It is gritty and visually very disturbing with some potentially powerful scenes but it feels too harsh and lacks emotional depth or heart. It just has no warmth and I don't mean that story about a POW war camp should be warm and fuzzy but when you're trying to appeal to people's sense of hope and heroism and unbreakable spirit...don't just constantly show the torture. The characters are very underdeveloped and you need to relate to these guys. It is a powerful story and the acting is decent and the style is very good but the script...sort of sucks. You almost feel bad saying that because of the content of the story and I honestly assumed a film like this would be a surefire hit for me because I love War stories like Saving Private Ryan, WarHorse or The Book Thief. I kept waiting to feel something...whether it be anger or fear or hope or sadness but I just watched like I would watch a straight forward informative documentary. I just wanted more and this didn't provide it for me. Finally after two hours of the film you get one incredible scene that moved me. Why did it take so long to get there? <br/><br/>Everyone who stars in this film is good. No one gives a terrible performance. The problem is that no one stands out on their own. All the POW's are the same, all the captors are the same and its a 2 1/2 hour ode to watching them go through torture. Jack O'Connell gives a good performance but I can't call it a leading performance because the character isn't given enough. We know he's an Olympian and showing us a few minor scenes from his childhood doesn't make us understand him any better. Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund and Jai Courtney are good in their roles but I promise you unless you know these guys to see them you wouldn't be able to tell which role they played. That's how generic their characters are. I can't honestly say they even captured the brotherhood between them very well although it wasn't terrible. Takamasa Ishihara is okay as sort of the ""head"" captor in the camp. This should be a pivotal and villainous role but it is as generic as the rest.<br/><br/>Now it sounds like I'm trashing the film and I'm not entirely. I think I can completely understand what Angelina Jolie was trying to do with this film. As I said a couple of times, the way it is short is very nearly brilliant. Its so grey and depressing and gritty. The dust in the air and the damp, awful POW conditions are shown perfectly. I think she really focused all her energy on making that aspect of this story come to life. She wanted to make it feel real. But I think what an experienced film director would tell you is that you need more than that to connect with your audience. Even the score of the film wasn't grand enough to move you when it should. Jolie absolutely has an eye for artistic style but she needs to see the film from our perspective. I'm a little surprised the Coen Brothers helped write this script, although I've always thought they're a tad over-rated. They do know how to really show off some character depth so I'm not sure what happened here. Maybe I'm missing the point but I've been utterly, devastatingly moved by other World War 2 films and this one just sort of gave me a half decent story and then said goodbye. Average at best. 6/10"

Now I think the story of this guy is incredible and worth telling, but unfortunately I'm judging the film alone, not a story. A film needs to be able to stand by itself. The movie simply failed to inspire much emotion from me. There I was sitting in the theater watching this guy go through absolute hell and I found that I didn't care that much (no disrespect to the real life guy). That, and the direction was lazy and just plain awful. The entire time I felt like Angelina Jolie had a checklist of things she needed to show and she was just checking them off as she went. It made the whole film feel very predictable and cliché. The ending was pretty bad too. No spoilers, but it just kind of stopped. All I thought of was Angelina Jolie checking off the last on her list and saying "" alright, that's everything, now how are we going to end this thing? Any ideas? No? Okay, lets just cut to the Americans winning and having a cliché tell the audience what happened to the real life characters after the events of the movie via pictures and text ending."" It isn't all terrible though. My biggest fear going into this was that it was going to be a one sided America is awesome movie. Thankfully it wasn't and I give them credit for that.

Even though this type of story has been told over and over again, it could have been put into an interesting context, but it never really raises the bar. Even the parts that (i later found out) happened in real life, seems to be a means of glorifying the protagonist exclusively and i didn't really become sympathetic to him, because it just seemed so fake. (Spoiler) Especially the part of the movie where the prisoners had to get in line to punch him didn't seem believable, if Jolie had shot the scene as it is depicted in the book, where more prisoners than him are being punched, it might have seemed more believable. So all in all, it could have been a great movie, but it never really becomes more than an attempt at conveying a moving story. Watch it if you like war movies and have to much time on your hands."

All of which might be quality material if subjected to critical analysis in a different movie, an intellectual meditation, but is just empty calories on the superficial level purveyed here, and, most importantly does not at all belong in this film of war and imprisonment, where whatever transcendence and redemption there is manifests itself only through the various courage and fortitude of men to soldier on through vicious and brutal reality, or to give over to the deadly despair or vicious sadism of inner demons and frailty.<br/><br/>Apparently a first directorial effort, fresh ideas, good instincts for performances, but so focused on expressing herself clearly as to blind herself to what the audience is experiencing given what we bring to the film, and so she presses too hard anxiously making sure every theme and motif is spelled out over and over again, until the audience is being drilled in a lesson rather than given the free, open, aesthetic experience needed to evoke pity and terror, profound emotion and illumination.<br/><br/>""Unbroken"" is worth seeing for its strong presentation of the ignored dimensions of our humanity in war, brutal captivity, cruelty, and extraordinary strength But it could have been (and might still be?) made into a great film with the necessary editing, something along the lines of what Pound did for Eliot, ripping out all the Sunday-school blather and letting the facts speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Hopefully, Ms Jolie will take a tip from Picasso who defined his artistic process as a sum of destructions, removing from the canvas everything that could be removed, until what was left was the painting."

Our review today of being a prime example of this assertion.<br/><br/>THE SCREENPLAY MAKES excellent, if somewhat limited, use of flashbacks as th film opens up with a bombing raid with a young crew of Airmen of the U.S. Army Air Corps. It quickly time-travels back to the early life of a young son of Italian immigrant parents; who shows plenty of anti-social and even criminal behaviour. The love and discipline of his Mother & Father, along with some good coaching from his older brother, nudge the boy's energies into Track & Field Athletics. His training leads to his berth on the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games and to Gold Medal victory.<br/><br/>THE ADVENT OF War in both Europe and the Pacific Rim interrupt the boy's further career in Running and we learn how his lessons learned as a kid come to full fruition in the Pacific Theatre of War. Strong sense of tenacity and the will to live prove to be the most powerful weapons against the tyranny and unbelievable inhumanity to man of the Axis Powers.<br/><br/>THERE ARE SOME who insist that the movie's subject matter was purposely brought out at this time as a reference to our own CIA's alleged ""torture"" of terrorist enemies ever since the events of 9/11/2001. We couldn't disagree more with this accusation and with its promoters.

For this they were paid and many Germans and Italians later emigrated to the USA and the Michigan Apple Orchards.<br/><br/>THIS IS INDEED a story which needed to be told, and soon as Father Time is rapidly calling to our World War II Vets, with main character, Louis Zamperini's having passed away earlier this year.

","Based on a true story of Olympian Louis Zamperini, Unbroken tell of his grit to survive extra ordinary situations. He was son of Italian immigrants who went to participate in the 1936 Olympics. As a soldier he survived a plane accident and survived 47 days at sea. Not to top that, he went on to survive a Japanese prison of war camp. The movie is grueling at times, but I believe captures the complexities of the fog of war. A remarkable story and one that inspires. Directed by Angelina Jolie and is nominated for 3 Oscars. Regardless of the critics, it is a good movie. It is an adventure entering an era long gone. Makes you appreciate the grit of those tough old guys."

","Knowing the story they had, the material they had at their disposal, this movie is a disappointment. The book is a punch in your face, powerful, visceral. The movie, on the other hand, is bland, is common place, it is cliché. And to see the main characters keeping their hair intact throughout the entire movie made me very upset. It is offensive to those that had to endure the real conditions of a Japanese prison. After reading the book one can't avoid the feeling of amazement. Even doubt. How can someone survive in situations like these? How can they endure out in the sea for so many days? The movie does not give you the same feelings, not as strong anyways. I wish this was done but a more experienced director. Clint Eastwood would make this simply epic."

","Director Angelina Jolie's homage to the plight of imprisoned World War II servicemen in Japan focuses on the true-life experience of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete from California. Though we've seen countless, horrific cinematic depictions over the years of how prisoners of war are terribly abused, Unbroken still has a lot going for it. Strong performances all around, added to a compelling story and flawless technical achievement in the art of filmmaking make Unbroken deeply disturbing yet ultimately uplifting and inspirational. One of the things this film rightfully drives home is that ""war is hell."" It's an old expression, but it continues to ring true to this day. And perhaps, as this film reminds us, we should never forget that the price of war is always devastation and depravity before victory."

At the end of the movie they tell us some things that they should have shown us in the movie. <br/><br/>Much of the character development in movies comes from the dialog between the characters. After the first twenty minutes of the movie they no longer make any attempts to have meaningful conversations between the characters you are supposed to care about. <br/><br/>It seemed like the director became completely focused on trying to make us feel uncomfortable and tortured and without hope, like the main character, but along the way she lost the real value in the story. She dropped the thread that should have made it all feel connected."
"InMyHonestOpinion","6","4","7","21 February 2015"," Sometimes surviving is the hardest part of life
","Films of war are so common now, everything that did or could happened has been recreated in one way or another, whether it be soldiers in the midst of a heavy battle taking fire from every angle, a rescue mission attempting to free trapped civilians by a specialist team, a prison camp and the harshness it endures or the last survivor of a family being brought home after his siblings are lost. One thing we have never really seen though is one man's story and all the hardships he goes through in one lifetime during a lifetime of war. Unbroken is Angelina Jollies third attempt at a major release this time though she got Ethan and Joel Coen on board to write the screenplay. So we know she can act somewhat but how is she when it comes to directing? Unbroken is the true life story of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini an Italian-American and his life. The film begins with Louie as a bombardier in the United States Army Air Force flying in a B-24 Liberator bomber, and one of their successful attacks on a Japanese Island from here the film jumps back to a much younger Louis. A trouble maker; he drinks, smokes and starts fights with the other boys. One day after being busted catching a glimpse up some girl's dress beneath the bleachers, Louis brother Peter watches Louis run desperate to get away and decides he will train him to be the best he can be as a runner where Louis makes it to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The film jumps forward again back to 1943 where Louis and his crew are back in the air on another mission, this time however the bomber aircraft they are in falls out of the sky and crashes into the ocean. Louis and two others from the crew make it onto a raft, where they wait to be rescued. Days and nights pass with the hope of being rescued slowly fading away, as their sanity slowly begins to fail as well, eventually the survivors are rescued but unfortunately it's not by their allies. (Too much to give away if I say anymore here) At first I wasn't over enthused to see this film, thinking it would be just another run of the mill war film, nothing new to happen but for a few new camera shots and maybe some tricky camera work. The way the film opens was absolutely stunning, the camera work in certain scenes was epic and should be respected for what was presented. Amazing action sequences high in the sky something I have never seen done so well. I was a little excited for what was to come but unfortunately I hate to say, it seems as though all the good juice was used for the first 15mins, the film then turns into a sadistic styled torture snuff feature. I understand that it is based on the biography of Louis Zamperini and I hold my hat high to everything the guy went through, I just feel it could have been told or more to the point shown very differently to what has been delivered. The film works well and tells the story that needed to be told personally though I would have loved to have seen what the Coen brothers would have delivered instead. The camera work is superb the locations are amazing, the script is harsh and sometimes a little forced, and the score is inspiring I'm sure Angelina only had the best intentions to bring this story to life I just don't think she pulled off the film the story is worthy of. Running longer than it should never helps either. Starring Jack O'Connell (Skins, 300 – Rise of an Empire) as Louis Zamperini, I'm sure everyone that knew the real man in life would have loved the character Jack O'Connell portrays in the film. Takamasa Ishihara (is actually a musician known as Miyavi) as Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe, he is very believable in his role at times absolutely horrific, Domhnall Gleeson (as Phil, Harry Potter, True Grit) Garrett Hedlund (Tron, Troy) as Fitzgerald, Finn Wittrock (American Horror Story, Winter's Tale) as Mac. Unbroken isn't anything new, it has been done before, but what you won't get is the story of one man's fight to survive when even the Gods are telling him to give up. Not an ideal family film but seeing a film that was to be banned when released in Japan because it gave them a bad image could be a great thing to discuss after the credits role."
"remittancegirl","2","4","7","8 February 2015"," Interesting History Doesn't Always Make Good Dramatic Entertainment
","Unbroken is undoubtedly an attempt to pay tribute to a man who underwent overwhelming struggles and suffered terrible abuse during WWII in the Pacific. In paying that tribute, the writers decided to stick very closely to both the character of the man and the events as he recalled them.<br/><br/>This might have made a compelling documentary and certainly an excellent biography, but that doesn't necessarily make it a good piece of dramatic narrative filmmaking without some dramatic embellishment.<br/><br/>Unbroken doesn't offer anything but a quotidian and rather superficial examination of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini as a person. Similarly, the lack of anything approximating revealing dialog or interpersonal relationships contributes to something very close to a pornographization of suffering.<br/><br/>Fully half of the movie consists of showing his appalling suffering - first during his 47 days of starvation and thirst on a life raft at sea, and then during his time in a Japanese prisoner of war camp where he is specifically targeted as a permanent punching bag.<br/><br/>History doesn't make good drama without good writing to bring out what reality only reveals in retrospect. This is the central problem with 'Unbroken'.<br/><br/>I found it both brutal and boring. And that combination is a rather obscene one. Considering the Coen brother's skills, I am quite sure they were aware of what they were creating, and to me, that makes the intentions behind the film inhumane and banally obscene."
"finebeanies","4","4","7","25 January 2015"," While the real story is very compelling, the film adaptation is not.
","Survival of the human spirit over unspeakable hardship and brutality could be very uplifting and inspiring. Unfortunately the viewer is not really given much to understand the thoughts that take Louie through his horrific journey. From his young days when he is heading for a life of crime until his older brother encourages him on the path of an Olympic runner we are not really given any insight into his thinking and motivation. We get glimpses of his determination but it is disconnected from his inner struggles. Patriotism is prominent on both sides but almost as a caricature, it does not feel real.<br/><br/>The movie spends inordinate time depicting the sadistic treatment in the prisoners of war camp and not enough on developing any of the relationships, either between the prisoners or with the guards, no view of how the prisoners help each other to keep their resolve. I found a couple of things quite distracting: throughout his ordeal one thing stays constant - Louie's shiny hair and a stylish haircut. And there are many cheesy moments, like when the whole camp comes to a long standstill watching Louie lift the log or when Louie rises to complete the race around the camp.<br/><br/>A pointless show of cruelty without character development. A story told in a Hollywood fashion, missing the heart and soul and filling it with corny moments."

","When the movie started, I was hooked from the beginning. Not only were the actors for each character perfectly cast, but they were all incredibly handsome (which was just a bonus). When the film displayed all that Louis Zamperini went through in order to survive, believing in himself and having faith he could make it both played an important role. It was extremely inspiring because it was a true story of a man who was forced to endure several tragic events and never gave up hope. No matter how bad the situation, he accepted the fact that it wasn't gonna be easy. He knew if he wanted to survive and make it through, he was gonna have to fight to stay alive. The movie made me more appreciative of my family, war veterans who fought for the life I am able to live today, and for my safety in general. I've never had to face what he faced, and if I was in his shoes I don't know that I could've made it out alive. I felt as though the movie displayed chain effects of his life, how one part lead to another, shaping Louis to be the man he was. If he wasn't a child that got into trouble, his brother would have probably never forced him to join the track team. If he had not joined the track team, he never would have made it to the Olympics. If he didn't train for the Olympics for years, he probably would not have had the discipline to survive and the ability to think positive. If he wasn't an Olympic athlete, both him and Phil may have been executed rather than sent to a POW camp. If Zamp didn't go through all these harsh, drastic measures, he may not have ever developed his faith in God and he would have ended up on the streets or in prison one day due to his bad behavior. He would have never learned to appreciate his family or his life. And he would have never experienced what forgiveness truly is.<br/><br/>I thought the story was beautiful and I cried a few times, because I couldn't imagine what he felt in real life. Zamp did his best to live the rest of his life while facing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder but he never fully let his hatred and desire for revenge take over him. I thought that was very impressive. I truly did love this movie and I applaud all those who produced it! Props to Angelina Jolie for stepping out of her comfort zone and challenging herself to direct this film! She did an amazing job!"
"russellingreviews","7","7","15","26 December 2014"," A good film that misses the spirit of the true story
","Louis Zamperini's story has been floating around Hollywood since 1957. Will his story finally be successfully translated onto the big screen? <br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... Unbroken has been one of the most anticipated films of 2014. The book has been an international bestseller and has exposed Louie's inspirational story to the world. When Angelina Jolie announced that she would be directing the film, waves of skepticism poured forth across the media. The hope was that the magic of the story would survive. <br/><br/>Overall rating: 3 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Family value: 2.5 stars<br/><br/>Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) grew up as the son of Italian immigrants in California in the depression era. His brother helped lead him from a life of juvenile delinquency to a life as a national track star. After an heroic run at the 1936 Olympics, Louis looked forward to running in the Tokyo Olympics in 1940, but World War Two broke out. He served during in the South Pacific on bomber flight crew. After a near-fatal plane crash, Louie and two other crewmen survive and spend a harrowing 47 days in a life raft. After surviving their ocean ordeal, they are rescued by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp. Louie is eventually sent to the camp run by tyrannical leader, Watanabe or as the prisoners called him, The Bird (Takamasa Ishihara). Because of his world notoriety as an Olympian, The Bird targets Zamperini and makes an example of him throughout his years in captivity. Through the torture and abuse, Louie and the other prisoners must figure out how to survive until the end of the war. <br/><br/>Zamperini lived an unbelievable, but compelling life. Julie Hildebrand's epic tale of Zamperini's life has been celebrated by many around the world. Louie's story has been travelling around Hollywood since 1957, and could not find the right director or lead actor. Angelina Jolie's choice to helm the Unbroken project presented a daunting task for the movie star turned director. Her film would be compared to the much loved literary treasure. Jolie managed to work with Joel and Ethan Coen to write the script. With the stellar production crew and the quality of story, this film has the potential for greatness or potential failure. Interestingly, the film falls squarely in between these two positions. Angelina did an admirable work in attempting to get as much of Zamperini's story into the film. She would have to choose what to keep and what to share, because to capture all of his story into one film cannot be achieved. She was able to achieve much of the back story through flashbacks. Also, the script cuts out much of the finer details from the book. Because of the lack of subtle nuances the film starts in full throttle and never relinquishes it's intensity. The scenes during their ocean experience went a bit too long, but even this portion becomes laborious and exhausting. By cutting out some of the subtle nuances of the book, Jolie seemed to miss some of the light and shade of the story which could have made this film more compelling. The ocean scenes and prisoner of war camps gave the needed atmosphere, but the special effects seemed very elementary. Jack O'Connell and Takamasa Ishihara give excellent performances in their on-screen adversarial roles. Domhnall Gleeson and Garrett Hedlund were well cast in their supporting roles, but did not excel beyond supporting players in Zamperini's story. Unbroken was an entertaining experience, but unlike the book was merely a celebration of the human spirit opposed a story of salvation and forgiveness of his actual life. <br/><br/>If you have not read the book, this review would be to watch the film prior to reading the book. The film was good, but the book gives a richer telling of Zamperini's life. Hildebrand's book was a joy to read and a true celebration of Jesus' impact on Louie's life. With all of the difficulties and challenges that come into his life, it was not until he come to a saving faith in Christ that the story becomes a true story of salvation and forgiveness. Zamperini's life is truly one to be celebrated, but it all sets up the impact of Jesus on the story that enriches the story and leaves the reader with a more satisfying experience. Jolie alludes to this part of his life, but without it being a centrepiece of the film she misses the heart of the story. I would recommend that anyone would go to see the film, but do it with the intention afterwards of reading the book. Your cinematic experience will be enhanced and your enjoyment of this story will be richer. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Rarely does a film finish with audience applause, but Unbroken concluded with a flurry of praise from the cinema's attendees. This is a compelling story and worth seeing, but after seeing it, take time to read the book. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. Why does suffering happen in the world? (Romans 5: 3-5, John 16:33) 2. How do people make it through traumatic situations like Unbroken? (Romans 12:12, Philippians 4:6-7 ) 3. How can Jesus make a difference in our lives? (Ephesians 2: 1-10, John 3:16)<br/><br/>Written by Russell Matthews based on a five star rating system @ Russelling Reviews #russellingreviews"

We are never given a chance to see the fire inside Zamperini, and his spectacular athletic achievements become only poorly placed cameos. The breadth and reality of POW suffering was glossed over.

","Forget about the ridiculously low numbered IMDb rating and the mediocre reviews on IMDb, this is a film for all to see, especially the leaders of the Japanese government. Yes, a few parts are a little long as is the entire movie so going to the restroom ahead of time is highly recommended. There are some small technical errors related to plane insignia and such but just go and see how the Japanese treated American prisoners during WWII. They did a lot more, much more terrible then what is shown. The American's they despised the most were B-29 crewman.<br/><br/>I feel ashamed that I own a Japanese-designed car (Honda) and that I have a big investment in Japanese Camera equipment (Nikon). There are discussions in Japan to ban or boycott this motion picture and Angelina Jolie. After all these years they just cannot handle the truth. Germans have learned the truth but not the Japanese. The Japanese don't really teach their children much of anything about the war. They either sweep it under the rug or state that the U.S. was responsible for all that happened to Japan, especially the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hardly anyone realizes that before WWI began, Japan was already starting to make plans for their control of the Pacific. That's correct – World War I, not World War II. They joined the Allies in WWI and were awarded some of the German island possessions such as the Marianas and the Marshalls. A lot of Americans died in the landings on these islands.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the settings (especially those depicting Japan) are great, the aerial sequences are great and the photography is great. Almost everyone in the theater applauded at the end including me. I also had some tears in my eyes at the end, for Louis and for those that put this film together.<br/><br/>You may not want to purchase any Japanese-made products for a while after seeing this movie. The fact as indicted is that the principal perpetrator escaped execution by the U.S. Government as a war criminal. The U.S. wanted to forgive and forget and this in my opinion is intolerable. I was too young to fight in WWII so I guess now I am doing it. Better late than never.<br/><br/>I have ordered the book on which the movie is based authored by Laura Hillenbrand."

The reviews were certainly a mixed bag, but seeing that the film was pretty much loved or hated, I decided to give a try. My take? This is an excellent film. It drew me in from the beginning and kept me captivated to the end. Without giving any of the film away, there were scenes that kept me on edge and at times, had me in tears. From many of the reviews I have read, I have the impression that there are Jolie haters. I don't really have an opinion of her. And I know this is her directorial debut? Or one of her first films to direct? All I can say is she did an excellent job. And the actors can be commended for their work. As far as those who compare it to the book. Again, I did not read it.

","** my review contains spoiler!!!** I found this movie exceptionally gripping. Angelina has made a brilliant movie. I dunno why some reviewers have spewed out venom in their reviews. perhaps these were the readers of the best selling book on which the movie was based, and they may have felt let down by the movie. The same thing happened with the Hollywood legend ""The Godfather""---- Many felt let down by the movie. Guys we must understand that it's not possible to show 400 pages of written text in a two and half hour movie. It's just not possible. Yet we want every scene described in the book be depicted on the screen. its NOT possible and not going to happen. That aside I believe Angelina made an exceptional ,movie on war , the suffering and incredible cruelty of the Japanese officer ( in charge of the POWs) --""the Bird"" ( Watanabe)played by newcomer Takamasa Ishihara. The amount of brutality and torture inflicted on Louis Zamperini is shocking, horrifying, sickening, appalling, atrocious, outrageous, shocking, painful, heartbreaking, and even ghastly. Honestly Angelina although the movie and the narrative and the direction are exceptional, the impact was too much too bear. I was exceedingly glad and relieved when the movie was finally over and the POWs released---it was so gripping! However more post release scenes ( of POWs) could have been shown to ease the poor audience's pain and trauma. Seeing brutality of Watanabe on American POWs the audience (like me)simply start hating that Watanabe #$%^ and you want terrible things happen to him (which unfortunately don't. He gets away with all the bad things he does to Zafarelli. That being said we the audience stood up and applauded at the end:)"

"RyanCShowers","Null","7","16","30 December 2014"," So Flat That it Might As Well Have Come in a Cardboard Box Mailed to Jolie's House
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERS<br/><br/>The trailer for ""Unbroken"" did not fool me—I knew something was off from the overly sentimental and uninspired footage months ago. After seeing the film though, I was correct in detecting the film's mediocre quality but not for the reason I thought. Angelina Jolie's directing style, as demonstrated with ""Unbroken,"" is to make the audience respond to her. She wants to see us flinch, jump, and wince. In theory, this sounds like a good quality to have, right? Well no, not if it's the only quality you have to engage the thinking viewer.<br/><br/>Imparting the intensity of a situation seemed to be on her agenda as the primary objective. In this regard, ""Unbroken"" does impale us with the extremity of the airplane scenes, the deserted emptiness of the ocean, and the grueling torture Louis Zamperini endured. (The ultimate ""jump scare"" of the film is when a shark attacks the survivors of the airplane crash on their raft. Everyone, and I mean everyone, in my theater leaped out of their seats.) <br/><br/>The problem with her work in ""Unbroken"" is that the emotional narrative is left astray. Though Louis remains ""unbroken"" by the actions committed against him, Jolie never lets us inside Zamperini's mind and shows us how he internalizes this physical and emotional pain. The dramatic moments that would have serviced this aspect of the story are deserted by Jolie, and instead, she leaves us to just witness the atrocities Zamperini valiantly overcomes. The action is there, but the emotions and understanding are not.<br/><br/>The worst thing about ""Unbroken"" is the ghastly screenplay, a text that surprisingly took a total of five writers to compose fully. This script is one of the worst adapted screenplays 2014 saw. The film's structure for the first half an hour is pointless, flashing back in time while relating nothing from said flashbacks to the present day scenes. The dialogue is terrible; clichéd, cheesy conversations and motivational phrases guide most of the narrative (including the unforgivably trite name-calling, bullying, homosexual jokes). The most damaging of it all is the lack of actual plot of which the movie is made up. There is no coherent ""storyline"" but rather a collection of events that one man was able to withstand.<br/><br/>Jack O'Connell does a fine job in portraying Zamperini, but his acting can only take the characterization so far. The characters in ""Unbroken"" are so flat and one-dimensional that they might as well have come in a cardboard box mailed to Jolie's house. The closest thing to an attempt at humanizing Zamperini is by alluding to character flaws through dialogue and that he sneaked alcohol in a milk-bottle as a child. Otherwise he's always seen doing the right thing, being a model for us mere mortals to emulate, and always remaining ""unbroken"". The supporting characters receive even less development. The main antagonist, revoltingly played by Miyavi, is given no justice whatsoever.<br/><br/>Jolie, herself, has proclaimed that the message of ""Unbroken"" is the power of forgiveness, yet I struggle to recognize this supposed ultimate-metaphor considering the portion of Zamperini's story that displays his forgiving of the captors is only shown at the end of the feature in the form of title-cards. ""Unbroken"" is actually a loosely-written, action-dependent film about how one man surmounts insurmountable physical plights. The movie Jolie describes was actually made and released earlier this year, ""The Railway Man"", starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>Having addressed all of my problems with the final product, I must say that ""Unbroken"" is technically apt and deserves Oscar nominations in cinematography, original score, sound mixing, and sound editing. (These technical elements are most utilized in the captivating plane scenes that open ""Unbroken"" and the most of the raft scenes.) The photography illustrated by the great Roger Deakins is especially beautiful and artistic, and the sound design will ring your eyes and pin you to your seat.<br/><br/>""Unbroken"" is intentionally epic, almost to a fault. You will grow tired of it by the third act, all of Jolie's tricks will be behind you, and you will be ready to pack up and leave. <br/><br/>Grade: C+<br/><br/>* * / * * * *"

","I thought it was overall a good movie with a fairly accurate portrayal of the history. I have not read the book and was more interested in the POW story, which is an interest of mine. <br/><br/>One thing that often comes out of POW stories is the intensely personal experience without any context given to the enemy. Most of the guards in these camps were either Korean, Taiwanese or, Japanese rejects including American born Japanese who weren't trusted. These Nisei often had a chip on their shoulder because of the discrimination they experienced. The non Japanese guards were also looked down on and got slapped around quite a bit. <br/><br/>Slapping subordinates was part of Japanese military discipline and so they didn't see anything wrong with doing it to prisoners. If the prisoners didn't take it the guard lost face and the situation escalated. <br/><br/>There actually were plenty of individual acts of humanity and kindness from guards which never seems to make it to film. The casualty rates among POWs were brutal, so overall it is not wrong to portray the camps as nasty inhumane places. Many of the deaths were due to malnutrition. Again it must be remembered that the Japanese were reduced to boiling grass towards the end - starvation of the civilian population was a war tactic caused by bombing and sinking of shipping. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie does acknowledge towards the end the Tokyo fire bombings. But the scale is played way down. 200,000 civilians burned to death on the night of 9th March 1945 alone. By American airmen. This is the context."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","27 June 2015"," Unbroken seem a little broken to me. It was mediocre, at best.
","Unbroken doesn't shows that a lifetime of glory, is worth a moment of pain, but it's semi-alright, because the will to live is strong with this movie. This historical biographic life story movie had been in development for nearly 60 years. At one time, even the great actor, Tony Curtis originally attached in the lead role. It was only made, after the phenomenal success of Laura Hillenbrand's 2010 novel, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption; which went on, to become a New York Times Bestseller. Soon, after this, actress Angelia Jolie show interest in turning the novel into a movie, with the movies studios backing, her claim as director. While, her skills as director are not that sharp, she was still able to product, a semi-alright film. It was well-shot, much thanks to Cinematographer Roger Deakins, but it felt like it was trying too hard to be Oscarbait. While, it didn't win any Oscars in 2014. It still had a strong opening for the last month of that year. The film revolves around the life of USA Olympian and athlete Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, (Jack O'Connell) during his time in World War 2. Without spoiling the movie too much, the movie is pretty historical accurate to Louis Zamperini's real life accounts of the war. Sadly, the later years of Zamperini's life are not mention in the movie, but can be read about in the latter chapters of Hillenbrand's book. Omitting Zamperini's fight against alcoholism and PTSD, as well as his Billy Graham-inspired religious conversion might seem wrong, because the audience don't see the happy redemption part, but I know Jolie wanted to spend the most time, with showing his near-death struggles during the war-years. After all, that's the meat of the story, and the movie run-time was already, getting a little long. The movie tries to hint, about all those omitted problems, but it doesn't work. It makes the movie so much more confusing, because it's missing those huge chucks of information. We don't know, much about his adult life. He's seem like a bland-boy scout caricature for the most part. Don't get me wrong, Jack O'Connell is fine actor, but they really didn't give him, much dialogue to work with. All, we know of him, based, just on the movie, is that he runs fast, and able to take a beating. We barely know anything about his personality. Another thing, we hardly see, is the supporting characters. All of his family or the co-pilots that he flew with; seem very much stock characters to me. They hardly gave, any useful exposition about Louie, nor help the scene, become memorable. I also didn't like, how the movie open, because it gave the movie, so really odd pacing. Jumpstarting the movie in the middle of the war, made the film, so chaotic. It's not good. The movie tries hard to tell the backstory, through flashbacks, but there so awkwardly, edited into the first part of the film that it barely match up, with what was happening on screen. While, the flashbacks did help show, how Louie became a runner; it doesn't show, how Louie the runner, became Louie the Airmen. Honestly, the movie would have, work better. if they only to focus, showing his life as a runner, first, then his time becoming an airmen, rather they showing him, already a airmen. I also didn't like, how the flashbacks stop, after the first act. It felt like a waste of a medium. They could had fit, so much more, in. The film really needed it. The first act is weak, because of it. It got really boring. The second part with the raft, really drags. While, it's shows how many days, Louie was stranded in the ocean, the movie tries too hard, being artsy that it forget to show much change in the characters. By the time, they are capture by the Japanese, the men barely have any facial hair, and still have somewhat clean enough clothes. It was really jarring. The last part of the film, was market the most, by trailers, making it seem like a survivor movie, but after watching this film, it felt more like torture porn. I really couldn't stand the Japanese actor, playing the Japanese prison of camp warden, Mutsuhiro ""Bird"" Watanabe (Miyavi). He was so over-the-top. He's a guitar player and needs to stick with music. For a PG-13, the torture is pretty harsh and brutal. While, the book make it seem like, they were trying to make the Bird seem like, he hiding some sexual repression, toward Louie. The writers here, don't do it. The movie plays it, safe, by making him, into a one-dimensional stereotype villain. While, the movie says that the Coen Brothers help wrote the script, I really don't see anything in the film that has that Coen Brothers style. I think, the others writers, mostly rewrote a lot of Coen's earlier scripts. One big that I kinda hate about the film is the lack of score. The movie seem a little too eerily in how quiet, it was. I really didn't think composter Alexandre Desplat did a good job. While the movie has a pretty predictable outcome, there are still dangerous moments that might surprise you, and make you jump, wondering if he was going to live or die. Honestly, in my opinion, the best way to watch this movie, is to go into it, having no clue, what's the story is about. I think this is the best way to leave an imprint on yourself. Overall: While the movie barely left one on me. It wasn't, a bad movie, for sake. Just meh. Could had been better."
"lee_eisenberg","7","3","5","12 April 2015"," survival under severity
","I had never heard of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini until he died last year. My dad had read Laura Hillenbrand's book about Zamperini's experiences in a Japanese POW camp, so Zamperini's death caught his attention. But the news that there was a movie about Zamperini's experience getting released caught my attention.<br/><br/>Well, Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken"" isn't a great movie, but it's worth seeing. The point is that Zamperini refused to let his captors break him, hence the title. Seeing what the captors did, I got the feeling that anyone in their positions would do the same. War simply breeds cruelty.<br/><br/>The movie's obvious downside is that Jolie probably made the movie with the aim of winning an Oscar. I didn't find the movie Oscar-worthy, and the Academy apparently agreed. In fact, some parts of the movie drug on too long. But I thought that it was a good look at how Zamperini stood strong in a desperate situation. Not a masterpiece, but something that you should. As for Jolie's decision to exclude the part about Zamperini's conversion to Christianity, that wasn't an important part of his survival in the POW camp, and there are a few too many movies in which people's faith ""saves"" them. The movie is good enough already."
"mks099","8","8","20","27 December 2014"," The Movie is Fine but should lead you to the book
","The ending was made knowingly and upon request to not include his life after war. It seems this is the biggest criticism of the movie. Since I knew this coming in, I liked the movie. I did not love it but I liked it very much. I also disagree with the reviews on here criticizing the acting. No, that was wonderful on all accounts. The movie did tend to lag on brutality so watch bringing the little ones. However, that is part of Louie's story. The movie is meant to be mainstream Hollywood and no where comes close to the book's inspirational levels. How about enjoying both for the different genres they are? You will not be disappointed if you see the book and movie as separate genres with different goals."
"dmanyc","1","4","8","6 November 2015"," Unbroken screaming, ""Give me Oscars!"" Uh, no.
","Why was Unbroken snubbed at the Oscars? It's beautifully shot, the acting is decent, it's an epic WWII movie. Yeah, but it's been done before in other movies and a thousand times better. Do we really need another WWII movie? Not really, but if you're going to do it anyway, at least tell a different story with a brilliant storyline that peaks your interest and have characters you care about (ex: The Imitation Game). You don't feel anything for Louis nor the other captives. The only character we feel anything for is The Bird, and he doesn't show up till halfway into the film. Louis' back story is quickly flashed back, so you don't get any sense of his family or why he chose to run in the Olympics or did he choose to enlist in the armed services or if he was drafted. Instead of showing you his life after he was rescued, like suffering from PTSD and finding God, we just get a quick rundown at the end of the movie. And for a bunch of captured Americans, they're still nicely groomed. A goatee here, a mustache there, but their hair still looked terrific. The movie Castaway did a much better job with unruly hair. Also there was no timelines. If one of the soldiers didn't announce the death of FDR, I wouldn't have figured that it was 1945. And the constant torture scenes. We get it; the war was brutal but enough already! And am I the only one bothered that an Irishman was cast to play the Italian American Louis? Are we short on Italian-American actors or did The Sopranos steal them all? Also how do FOUR screenwriters, all Oscar winners and nominees, come up with THIS terrible adaptation of a best-selling book? This was a story badly done. The real Louis (R.I.P) deserves better."
"bkoganbing","8","4","8","27 March 2015"," Endure the unendurable
","By any stretch of the imagination Louis Zamperini was a hero and role model in any number of ways. In getting to see a rough cut of Angelina Jolie's film before he died, he got to see how millions and millions unborn will get to see his life. I think that's something you can't ask for more.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for what Jesse Owens did in the 1936 Olympics Zamperini's story would be more well known even before Unbroken came out. A kid who had a lot of trouble with the law as a juvenile delinquent and a kid whose family was the only one of Italian origin from his small town of Torrance, California he felt the pangs of discrimination. A wise older brother told him to find an outlet and channel his energies into more constructive ways. Track and field became his outlet and in his time he became a legend, sad to say for posterity eclipsed by that other legend of Jesse Owens and the gold he won at Hitler's show palace in Berlin.<br/><br/>He was training for the upcoming Olympics scheduled for Tokyo in 1940 when the World War broke out putting a lot of things in the world on hold. In the Armed Services Zamperini became a gunner in the Army Air Corps and got shot down and with two others one of whom died he was on a life raft for over a month. <br/><br/>Rescue comes in the form of the Japanese and he and his fellow survivor spend a couple of years as Japanese prisoners and their treatment of captives was legendarily sadistic. His own strength of character permitted him to endure the unendurable. And he got to see Tokyo from an interesting point of view.<br/><br/>I have to say that I did not recognize most of the players in Unbroken, but probably that was better because it became more authentic. Jack O'Connell plays Zamperini and Garrett Hedlund plays his fellow survivor from the plane and the prison. Takamasha Ishihara plays one of the prison camp officers who singles out Zamperini for some special treatment. He is chillingly evil.<br/><br/>O'Connell and Hedlund are effective in their portrayals as well. Without star baggage which he will now have O'Connell makes you think you really are looking into the most triumphant and despairing moments of the life of Louis Zamperini. Angelina Jolie triumphs as a director as well. I have a feeling that she wanted to make an inspirational movie for the family she and Brad Pitt have to see.<br/><br/>The vistas of Australia and the blue Pacific Ocean surrounding it was a great location and responsible for the Oscar nomination Unbroken got for cinematography. Unbroken also was given recognition by the Academy with two other nominations in the Sound department.<br/><br/>Add a Coen brothers inspirational script and story and you have the makings of a fine film tribute for a real hero."
"NBates1","10","6","14","25 January 2015"," Excellent!
","After reading some of the mixed critical reactions for Unbroken, I did not know what to expect. It was the same with Maleficent, which I ended up loving. The theater was about half- full. First of all, the cinematography was masterful, as one would expect from Roger Deakins. The visual effects were excellent and the coloring, sets and design, etc. were all perfect for the film. I found the story to be extremely involving and was 100% focused on what happened on the screen. Jack O'Connell is an extremely talented young actor and was the right choice for this role. All performances were great. <br/><br/>In only her second feature film as director, Angelina Jolie did an extremely impressive job of putting the story together. She has this 'classic' method as if you are watching a Hollywood classic film. And I also found it great that for once, I am watching a 'respectful' film without excessive sex and language. This showed the characters to be more of the 'gentleman' type, which I respect. The shots of the real 80-year-old Louis running in Japan showed that it is never too late to fulfill anything and I have great respect for this man. It is also a moving film, especially the scene where he contacts his family through radio in the U.S. Also the torture scenes were very upsetting and felt very real. Some of my personal favorite moments from the film were when they were on the raft in the middle of the Pacific struggling to survive. I thought these scenes were marvelously done. All in all, an excellent film and cinematic experience."
"robertmike57","9","6","14","2 January 2015"," A Movie Judged by What Is and Not By Expectations
","I liked the movie Unbroken and it is interesting by the standards others are judging this movie, which isn't fair. These are a summary of the detractor: -Knocking Angelina Jolie is not fair: I thought the story was told in excellent manner and the script put on the screen what I would want to see. -The movie could had been a mini series: agree this could had been a 2 part movie with the first part fully dealing with Zamperini's track career and ending at Zamperini taken to Kwajalein island. The 2nd part could include the parts where he was kept in a secret prison and going through Zamperini meeting with the Japanese POW's in 1950. Jimmy Sasaki could had been in such a 2 part movie. However, that is not the movie which was made. -Should had included Billy Graham: agree, provided it was Zamperini's change and dealing with PTSD that was the focus. -Japanese were much more brutal that depicted: agree,the movie could had shown that and the ways men held up as POW's.<br/><br/>I am happy with the story as told and making it to the screen, but it fell short of a great movie. I just did not get Jack O'Donnell as Zamperini. It wasn't that he was terrible, it was that he didn't have Zamperini's presence which comes through in his a autobiography and the Hillenbrand book. I expected far more from the Cohen brothers script, they have done far better, this was rather flat compared to their best efforts. Making the Bird more human was a mistake, he was 22nd most wanted war criminal by MacArthur. Its like this was a concession to get into the Japan market. The men were far less healthy at the end of the war than as shown. A story with humor relief that could had come from how the men coped, elements in the book but left out, allowing the movie drag. My 9/10 could be an 8, but the I appreciate that the movie got made as it was long overdue."
"aharmas","9","6","14","28 December 2014"," Enduring Hell
","There is too much praise going around for films that are trying too hard to be original, whimsical, or creative. There is a big difference between taking on a project and carrying it out to its successful completion. ""Birdman"" and ""Boyhood"", have in my opinion fallen short because they look good in paper but are at best boring and/or puzzling. ""Unbroken"" is based on a real life story, and Ms. Jolie has put together an excellent adaptation of that biographical account.<br/><br/>From its opening scenes, it feels right. She is capable of recreating periods in history, giving them a realistic atmosphere, a tone that remains through the entire film. It treats its subject matter with sympathy and accuracy. We meet Louis Zamperini when he is a troubled and impulsive young man. The young man playing him portrays with fire and frustration. We see how he will eventually change into the man with an iron will that will survive a stay in hell.<br/><br/>I was hoping we'd get more of the flashback scenes because they convey the sense of loyalty and support a family gives. I kept thinking how much more I would have liked ""The Godfather II"" if Coppola hadn't overdone his own flashbacks. There is true affection here but not over-sentimentality. It transitions well to the scenes where Zamperini is shown with his air force buddies. He is a strong man who believes in being loyal but has a hard core. Jolie understand this very important part of his character, and that is what makes the most difficult part of the film watchable and has us rooting for Louis's success.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit long, but it moves well, and it engages us, as we see Louis grow into a more confident man, a man who just won't quit while trying to achieve his personal goals, and who will probably dry trying to protect his point of view and his loyalty for his country. The time he spends in Japan is like living in hell, and facing his Japanese counterpart is hypnotic and scary. Here is a man who hates with conviction, with his own share of negative baggage, and we know that something is wrong with his personality, with his beliefs. That is not a matter of politics or loyalty. His personal attacks on Zamperini feel focused, personal, originating from some internal demon that propels him forward. We are curious to find out what is happening inside his head, and we know he might eventually kill Zamperini if he is allowed to do so.<br/><br/>Jolie has proved himself a winning director, giving us another perspective of what it was like to live through this kind of torture. It is not meant to be explained, and with the help of some excellent writers, she has taken us inside a man's soul, his exposure to horrible evils, and his inner desire to survive and never stop. Yes, it would have been interesting to learn more about what allowed him to forgive in the end, but it is still a rich experience, enough to show us what he had to endure and how he managed to surpass it.<br/><br/>A winning film."

"eddie_baggins","6","5","11","1 February 2015"," Something here is most certainly broken
","It would be right to ask how such an incredible and out of the ordinary true life story could become such an ordinary run of the mill film? The answer however can't be easily given. Is it ""spoilt-brat"" Angelina Jolie's stoic yet uninspired direction? A weakish script that no less than 4 accomplished writers including the Coen Brothers worked on? Perhaps it's the fine yet strangely emotionally distant performances from the films leads? What makes Unbroken such an impressively average film could be anyone of these things and it's a shame that this once touted Oscar contender is what it is.<br/><br/>So many things in Unbroken scream quality, from the hugely impressive and well-staged opening aerial dogfight, the often stunning frames captured by legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins through to the committed and perhaps star making turn from up and coming superstar Jack O'Connell, there is without question a lot of finely crafted movie making on show here yet it's not enough to suggest Unbroken is anything but middle tier.<br/><br/>This feeling of fluctuation between high quality and hallmark movie staples stems from a not always consistent flow, a challenge the filmmakers no doubt had when trying to adapt Laura Hillenbrand's extensive and well renowned biography of Louis Zamperini. Zamperini's stunning life so vividly captured on page fly's by in mere minutes on screen and in some instances disappears all together while other key moments of his life such as his terrible ordeal on the open oceans during World War 2 take up large chunks of the films 130 minute run time. We get these key scenes to make us feel some of Zamperini's overcoming's yet we never feel invested in the man, for such an horrific and human courage filled story, the film barely ever draws out emotion from the viewer and this can only be attributed to the fact we never feel invested in a character we don't really get know, it's certainly not from bad acting.<br/><br/>Jack O'Connell, so impressive in the recent film Starred Up, does a commendable and committed job at bringing this larger to life figure to screen, yet with a role that is at times utterly underwritten and un-fleshed out, he can only do so much. Unbroken is absolutely Louis's story and we never get a proper feel for who this man is and from those around him like Garret Hedlund's fellow POW Fitzgerald through to Domhnall Gleeson's pilot Phil, we also don't get much of a feel for those that surrounded Zamperini through his darkest hours. Other elements of his life such as his youth and time as an Olympic runner get the short shift as victims of the films aforementioned flow troubles.<br/><br/>Unbroken is very far from a bad film but it's also not a great one by a very large margin. Jolie in her second feature film as director shows a keen eye for an image and a casting choice yet on the basis of this effort, has yet to master the art of getting the audience to invest themselves emotionally into such a tale that so easily could've become a war set classic. It seems as though if you've yet to discover Zamperini's tale for yourself, the source novel on which this is based upon should be your first point of call.<br/><br/>3 token Oscar nominations out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

It depicts the worst human suffering through true story; a story so overburdened with pain and trauma that most filmmakers would make it unbearable to watch, but somehow Angelina and the Coen brothers manage to keep it highly engaging the whole time.

If you have ever watched a movie and wondered how much of what you are watching is actually true, then add this to that list of titles. I can not stress enough the difference between a movie that is a true story and one that is based on a true story. This movie is certainly the latter.<br/><br/>What I think the creators were trying to do was to compare the torture that you experience running, with the torture you experience when going through extreme adversity. The problem was that the creators missed badly. They spent too much of the movie focusing on the adversity and not enough focusing on his youth, and his running, and his family, and the things that actually prepared him for his situation. I found myself saying ""Ok that didn't really happen like that"" multiple times in the movie. Even if it was true I stopped believing in it. And that is what we call losing your audience.<br/><br/>Just as you have had enough and you are preparing for the sappy ending, you get some of those ""what happened off screen type credits"" and then boom, cue ColdPlay. Disappointing movie to say the least. It would have been much more interesting if Angelina Jolie acted in the movie instead of directing it."
"preben_hassel","4","2","3","4 May 2015"," I wouldn't recommend it.
","Another WWII POW movie. We've seen bunch of these before, haven't we? Well. This one doesn't really stand out. I read a horrible critic about the movie here on IMDb before watching it, but because of the general 7/10 rating of the movie I gave it a chance. But really, I'm just sitting here thinking I wasted 2 hours of a perfectly good evening watching this. I didn't really get entertained and actually fell asleep once during the movie. It's not directly horrible, but it lost me half way through the movie. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Do not watch this unless you are really interested in the topic."
"JimSun444","7","2","3","27 April 2015"," I was hoping for much more.
","A December 14 2014 story by Laura Silverman in The Telegraph had the tag line ""Louis Zamperini ran in the Olympics, spent 47 days in a life raft and survived two and a half years in Japanese prisoner of war camps, but it's his victory over anger that continues to inspire others."" Unfortunately, the movie concentrated entirely on the first part of that idea and not at all on the latter part.<br/><br/>I'm not a religious man myself, but I was very anxious to see how AJ was going to portray that part of Louis' life in this movie. She did it with a couple of sentences on screen at the end of the film. Disappointing.<br/><br/>I loved the book, and I commend Angelina Jolie for her attempt to bring the story to the screen. What she did put on film was pretty darn good. I just wanted more.<br/><br/>If they can split the Hobbit into 3 movies (and the final Twilight book into 2, for cryin' out loud!), Unbroken should have been a two part epic."
"annie707","4","2","3","25 April 2015"," Lifeless
","So I rented Unbroken to watch with the family. Thought it would be an inspiring heartfelt movie. The back story-the true story of Louie Zamparini is awesome. The movie? Lifeless. The only thing that set my emotions was the shark. Poor shark. I'm thinking really? Some shark's just swimming around and then bam! Shot by a fighter plane. Anyways. The actors? I had no emotional connection to at all. I think this is an amazing story and in the hands of a more experienced director this movie could've been way better. I don't mean to bash on Angelina Jolie. I think she's great for bringing this story to life but maybe she needed a little more direction herself. So I'll give it 4 out of 10. Could've been less but the real story behind this movie deserves stars."
"wisewebwoman","4","2","3","25 April 2015"," Extraordinarily Flat in the Telling
","The story of Louis Zamperini, an inspiring journey of a delinquent turning into a Olympic contender, then a bombardier is rendered as flat as a pancake in the film Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken."" <br/><br/>The inspiring next 3/4 (the story after the war) is completely omitted, thus leaving us with an impression of male model with perfect hair and barely a beard after 45days without much sustenance on a raft taken in to custody by the Japanese in a POW camp and beaten, oh, every five minutes in film time. <br/><br/>There is absolutely no character development, no horrific injuries shown, not much camaraderie between the campers, only the old trope of the evil, pathological POW commander focusing all his attention on the hero taken out for yet one more airing. <br/><br/>It seems impossible given the content of the true story, death defying challenges, a conversion to God, etc. could be such a bore. But it was. 4 out of 10 for the cinematography. There's a great movie buried underneath this yet to be made."
"z-91883","5","2","3","23 April 2015"," Unbroken Is Really Broken
","Louie always got in trouble but his brother helped him and he started running track then Louie qualified for the 1936 Olympics. When WWII started Louie enlisted in the military. His plane crashed in the Pacific he survived 47 days in a raft until the Japanese navy captured him and his crew. They put him in a POW camp but he was a big target for the Japanese commander.<br/><br/>When they were on the raft they would kill fish and sharks to eat. They spotted a plane and the plane started shooting them so they jumped in the water. The Japanese commander made all the prisoners punch Louie in the face but when they wouldn't want to punch him Louie would scream and them to do it so the Japanese wouldn't beat them.<br/><br/>Towards the end, Louie picked up the board and the commander started hitting him. Then they said since he did that they could wash up in the river. When they looked up the planes flew over them and they said the war is over. The U.S. dropped care packages to them so they could eat and read when they were still in Japan.<br/><br/>Angelina Jolie was the director, yes the actors were good and well chosen, Jack O'Connell this movie was really tied in to everything all the transitions through each thought was good. I liked and disliked a lot of things about it but I think the director did very well.<br/><br/>Was a great actor so was Finn Wittrock, yes the story flowed well it went in order, the flash backs were smooth and went well. I think they acted very well for this kind of movie. They played the part very well also.<br/><br/>The film background seemed real but when they caught the fish and sharks it seems fake because you can just grab a shark out of the water. All of the costumes, hairstyles, cars and houses fit perfectly in the movie. The music was good it tied everything in together to make it run smooth.<br/><br/>Some of the positives of the movie is that it talked about his Olympic life and how he always got in trouble but turned his life around and started running track. Then he joined the military and started working on that and did better with his life. Another positive is that he survived a long time just him and his buddy's. He also didn't let anyone BREAK him so he is UNBROKEN.<br/><br/>Some of the negatives is that how he got beaten by the Japanese people. The movie didn't go in depth on his track life it just showed a little about it and I think it should have showed more. I didn't get how they grabbed the sharks out of the water and killed them to eat them I don't think people can just grab a shark and not get hurt from it.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to people older than 12 because it can teach you not to give up and keep striving to do well. It also shows you can turn your life around from being bad to being good. But this movie can teach a lot of life lessons to kids so that's why I recommend it. It's a really decent movie. Kids can really learn from this movie.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a 3.5 because it taught me some good things and also some bad things. I learned that you should never give up on life that if you set a goal that you can achieve this goal. That he risked his life for a lot of people and saved a lot of people and even did some things he didn't want to do. But I think it's a little bit too short. I think it should be longer. That's just my opinion."

"hunter_kudjo","8","1","1","11 September 2017"," Fantastic, beautiful movie if you've never read the book lol......
","IMDb reviews are always perplexing, hence why I don't really come here all that often. After watching this movie, however, I had to jump in to clarify what a great movie this is and how to differentiate it from the negative reviews - based on your familiarity with the story. I had never heard of Zamperini's story prior to seeing this. With that in mind, I didn't have nearly a high enough standard to hold the film up to as fans of the book did. That standard is plenty high though, as far as war films go. Would absolutely recommend seeing it if you're not familiar - Zamperini's struggle almost doesn't seem real it's so epic in scope.<br/><br/>I've seen quite a few naysayers on here complaining about the lack of character development and overly brutal torture scenes that go on and on. Although I agree the character development could be more dynamic at parts, WAR is WAR! The director Angelina Jolie did not sugarcoat life as a POW - it is quite literally suffering, torture, and death 24/7, particularly in Japanese camps. Anyone asking for ""less torture"" is doing a serious injustice to the pain our armed forces endured. You SHOULD know their pain, and know it well. <br/><br/>Others also said the movie felt ""heavily routine"" and bland. Again, having never heard of Zamperini, I find it hard to understand what's routine and bland about going to the Olympics, falling out of the sky into shark infested waters for 45 days on a single life boat, surviving not one but two POW camps, and in the end, forgiving your own captors that tortured you. I kept thinking the movie was going to randomly end at any point and Zamperini rescued, but this was delayed in a fantastic way. I get that the book had a lot more aspects of the struggle going for it, but this is 2 hours people. Lots of audiences already find that too long, sadly. Jolie condensed what she could as best she could with the Coen brothers imho. <br/><br/>I also liked to trying comparing this to Hacksaw Ridge, another excellent competitor in the selfless war movie genre. Both have fantastic stories and harrowing moments, but HR seemed weirdly more cliché than Unbroken did, to me. HR didn't have enough slow moments to breathe, subtle character moments that show you things off-camera that help set the scene (wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean in unbroken, Macks foreshadowing nervous demeanor). The dialogue at times also seemed heavily Hollywood-ized instead of the more realistic soldier dialogue from Unbroken. There was something more haunting about seeing every one of Zamperinis' friends fall victim to their circumstances than the expected-to- die soldier companions in HR. <br/><br/>There are truly some remarkable things in Unbroken that make it an absolute worthwhile film to watch. Anyone saying otherwise is looking a little too deep."
"areatw","6","1","1","9 August 2017"," Well-made but too bland and middle-of-the-road
","'Unbroken' is set during WWII and tells the incredible true story of an Olympic athlete, Louis Zamperini, who survived 47 days in a raft at sea, only to be caught by the Japanese and sent to a prison camp, where he is tortured by a sadistic Japanese commander. It's an unbelievable story and one that had the potential to be turned into a memorable film, but 'Unbroken' doesn't really do the story justice.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film is its surprising lack of any real emotion. It left me cold, I didn't feel a connection with any of what was happening on screen. Louis is such an easy character to sympathise with, he's somebody you naturally want to see survive and succeed, but I never felt that when I was watching the film. 'Unbroken' is an easy film to sit through because it's so well-made, but I felt detached. It lacks character and is too bland to be remembered."

O'Connell grips tightly on the ropes attached to the raft, praying to God to help him make it through this horror.<br/><br/>""Unbroken"" is a story made more powerful because it is true.

Admittedly, the home scenes (which start off the film) are slightly more bland and the characters are flatter but I think that make sense - they serve as a backdrop to Louie as an adult, as a runner, and into the military. <br/><br/>The adult Louie is portrayed very well. The drama grips you - it made me cry at times, look away in horror, but mostly, this movie inspires me every day. It is a story of personal strength and a touch of faith, patriotism, family, friendship, and mostly, the triumph of the human spirit - not just as a cliché, but as an incredible reality. <br/><br/>This movie can be frightening but if you've got someone to hold onto while you watch, it's worth every second.

","I don't understand all the negative reviews and it seems to be aimed at Miss Jolie. Exactly why is something only they would know but I watched this without even knowing who the director was and thought it was very well made. The story of Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete captured by the Japanese navy after a plane crash in the Pacific during the second world war is a harrowing tale which left me constantly amazed at the resolve of humans in the face of unbelievable hardship and cruelty. Jack O'Connell acts well and is totally believable as are all of the cast. Miyavi seemed a little too feminine looking to be playing the evil camp overseer Watanabe who seemed to take personal delight in torturing Zamperini. What came across is how Watanabe was jealous of Zamperini and bitter about his own shortcomings. I guess it shows that during war the bullies who are nobody's in civilian life and then have some power become so evil. this has also been shown by accounts in Nazi concentration camps.<br/><br/>So over all I rate this as a very good film and about an amazing true life. Violent but not too graphic it is a tale of human resolve and desire to survive that many youths today would do well to study."

Wonder why she decided to show less blood (unlike Steven Spielberg). Thanks for that!

","""Unbroken"" - Angelina Jolie's second movie as a director, is based on the incredible true live story of the Italian-American Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), who finished 8th in the Olympic Games in Berlin 1936. Alas everything changes after he joins the US Army as a bombardier. Given orders to go on a rescue and a search mission over the Pacific , Louis' plane crashes into the ocean due to a technical problem, leaving him and two of his fellows alone in the open sea with no food and water. They have to survive on an inflatable boat, which is their only protection from the bloodthirsty sharks. The three survivors, after 47 days of eating fish and drinking rain water, are fortunately, or maybe unfortunately (as Louis says ""I have good and bad news, friend"") are found by the Japanese navy and then put in war prison in Japan.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie is not as good as good as the true story. I was confused, because so much things happen in the first one hour of the movie that leaves you thinking ""What the hell happened?"". You can not really decide whether this is a sports movie, a survival story, a war movie or a drama one? Maybe It is everything mingled together, but this time, the Coen brothers , who are recognized widely for their movies ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""True Grit"", failed to give us this kind of epic screenplay they used to.<br/><br/>Even thought Jolie is still getting into the Directing insides, ""Unbroken"" is a good try-out for her."
"Pzachlen","5","1","1","10 October 2015"," Direction
","Her direction was flawless on the technical side. Camera, framing, production design, all was beautifully done. As were the performances. However it seems she is guilty of the same obsession with masochism as is Mel Gibson. All the scenes of brutal beatings, lashings, canning were so over the top that no one could survive such bodily injury. Also the things that did not work for me was the under water scenes lasting far to long for anyone to hold their breath. Also why in over a month at sea, in a raft, did none of the guys grow much facial hair. Also they must have had great barbers in those prisoner of war camps. Every guys hair was perfectly trimmed and never grew,"

I highly recommend the film. Kudos to Angelina Jolie for a finely directed film.

Unbroken does not mark Angelina Jolie in the same way. This is a truly terrible tale of human suffering but it leaves you unmoved (and I am a movie crier). I think the lack is in the characterisation - we learn nothing about the subject except that he was an Olympian.

"tmaj48","3","1","1","5 June 2015"," Unfinished
","Imagine a remake of The Diary of Anne Frank in which all of the dramatization of Anne's hopes and dreams, her relationship with her family, and her views on life are skimmed over, and the bulk of the film concentrates on her miserable last days at Bergen-Belsen. That's pretty much what this film is like. Based on Laura Hillenbrand's moving biography of the former Olympic runner Louis Zamperini, who spent over a month lost at sea after his plane crashed into the sea during a failed rescue mission during WWII, only to be ""rescued"" by enemy Japanese soldiers and thrown into a POW camp, where he suffered horrific brutality at the hands of a sadistic officer, this would seem to be a story that would be nearly fool-proof in its potential to honor Mr. Zamperini's courage and spirit, as well as bring audiences to tears. Yet it fails to do so. While the movie documents the desperation of the survivors lost at sea, and the physical torture inflicted upon Japanese POWs during WWII, it loses sight of what made Mr. Zamperini's life story truly remarkable. Those who were fortunate enough to read Ms. Hillenbrand's book are more likely to be irritated by this film in that it stops immediately after Zamperini's return to the U.S. It's his postwar life, including years of post- traumatic stress disorder and alcoholism, which threatened his marriage, his sanity, and his soul, which is fully half the story in the book. His turning to religion and his triumph over alcoholism enable him to save himself, and his decision to forgive his captors, to the point of seeking out the guards who brutalized him and personally express his forgiveness, are a major part of the book and of Zamperini's redemption and triumph over his tragic experiences. Jolie glosses over all of that in this adaptation, relegating it all to a slide show of on-screen text at the end of the film, as if his postwar struggles were little more than an afterthought. Instead, the film concentrates largely on the beatings delivered to Mr. Zamperini in the camp--over and over again, we see scenes of him him being punched and struck with sticks until he's beaten bloody and stunned. But this isn't what made Zamperini's story so remarkable--it's how he was able, after years of anger and bitterness and nightmares, to rise above it and repair his spirit. Too bad Jolie treated this aspect of this great man's life so negligibly. <br/><br/>In a too-short documentary on Louis Zamperini's life that's included on the DVD, some of the details of his later years are filled in--his trip to Japan to meet with and forgive his captors; his meeting with Billy Graham which helped turn his life around; the camp for boys that he helped establish; his enjoyment of skateboarding and skiing which continued into his 80s and 90s; his joy for living in his later years. This bonus feature seems to capture the real Louis Zamperini, as documented in the book, much better than the movie ever does. Jolie mentions that she showed a rough cut of her film to Zamperini as he lay in a hospital bed in his final days. It makes me shudder to think of him watching a blow-by-blow reenactment of his suffering in a POW camp as he lay dying, but nothing depicting his spiritual triumph over adversity. Both Jolie and the movie were ""snubbed"" for Oscar nominations; it's easy to see why. Mr. Zamperini was a great American hero, not for what he suffered, but for how he survived and ultimately thrived, and he deserved a much better tribute than this.<br/><br/>A year prior to this, another film, The Railway Man, depicted a similar true-life story which was more successful in dramatizing the postwar trauma and eventual redemption of a former POW. That film was more successful in doing justice to its hero. Seek out that film instead. Otherwise, for the real story of Louis Zamperini, read the wonderful book by Laura Hillenbrand."

Sorry the main actor appeared to me as being too stoic with little dialog to enhance his situation all through the film. Anyway, there is little more to say about it, another POW war film, that seemed to me to lack passion. It's OK, but the story line to me lacked something maybe drama and too pedestrian and long winded.<br/><br/>One got the impression that the Japanese 'the bird' knew him from the 1936 Olympics, when few if any Japanese even entered as they had invaded China.

"slothhead54","7","7","18","21 December 2014"," Certainly not a bad film but I wished I had had a more visceral reaction to it
","In her sophomore effort as a director, Angelia Jolie brings the true story of Olympian and veteran, Louis Zamperini , to life on screen. The film is an adaptation of the novel ""Unbroken"" written by Laura Hillenbrand and has been adapted into a screenplay by the beloved Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen.<br/><br/>Opening in the middle of the Pacific Arena of World War II just before a bombardier aircraft is about to bomb a Japanese target, we are introduced to Louis Zamperini played by the very capable Jack O'Connell ('Starred Up', ''71'). Wonderfully sound mixed, the fighter jets maneuver with precision in airborne combat suggesting a more modern era of war. Successful in their mission, it isn't until the soldiers are back at base following a nail biting landing before casualties can be accounted for. From here things move backward in time into Louis Zamperini's childhood.<br/><br/>A series of flashbacks in the first act of the film offer an inside look into his troubled youth and his introduction to track. As a young boy, Zamperini is a troublemaker disguising milk jars with paint and filling them up with liquor and admiring young girls from underneath their skirts beneath the bleachers. Constantly having to escape authority or bullies on foot, those around him soon notice Zamperini's natural speed. No one more than young Pete Zamperini, his brother, played by John D'Leo, is convinced of Louis' natural talents and begins to coach him. Fast-forwarding through his track career the film stops briefly to explain his qualifying time for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Munich. Trying to build suspense and intensity, Zamperini's Olympic event in Munich quickly paces back and forth between O'Connell's race around a very noticeable CGI populated stadium and his family listening intently by radio back home in the U.S.<br/><br/>Returning to the Pacific, the crew and Louis are only on terra ferme for a short while before they receive new orders for a recovery mission. Over the Pacific things go terribly wrong with their aircraft when both left wing engines fail and a very immediate crash water landing ensues. When the chaos has ended, Zamperini is only one among the survivors that include Phil played by Domnhall Gleeson and Mac played by Finn Wittrock. Deploying two life rafts, the three men settle onboard for what will end up by forty-seven days at sea. Probably the least effective part of the film, O'Connell, Gleeson & Wittrock portray the hopelessness of being caught at sea without resources as best as possible. One scene in particular involving the conquest, carving and consuming of a seagull that leads to nausea overboard appears more comedic than desperate. Rescued at sea by a Japanese naval vessel, the only two surviving G.I.'s are immediately imprisoned. <br/><br/>After being detained briefly in tiny interrogation chambers, Phil and Louis are separated with Louis being assigned to a more permanent prison camp with other allied G.I.s taken prisoner. The director of the camp, Mutsushiro Watanabe and better known as ""The Bird"" is played by Miyavi, an unbalanced, erratically behaving lunatic that sets his sights squarely on Zamperini early on. The Bird seems intent on punishing Zamperini and breaking his spirit by force rather than deprivation. Miyavis emotionless stare and heartless attempts to break Zamperini propels the last act of the film. By the time the war concludes, the contentious relationship between detainer and detainee has had a subversive effect on Zamperini.<br/><br/>Director of photography, Roger Deakins, has proved to be a master behind the camera creating memorable images in 'Skyfall' and 'Prisoners' most recently. In 'Unbroken' Mr. Deakins seems largely interested in using shadows and angles to dress up the visual content. Certainly one of the greatest working cinematographers around, his images appear too glossy and colorful instead of breathing out the gloom and despair of the Japanese prison camps or the time spent at sea. Scenes of U.S. G.I.'s shoveling coal and covered in coal dust at one of the prison camps appear more like orphans from 'Oliver Twist' than prisoners of war. <br/><br/>Director Jolie, clearly passionate for this narrative, strives to convey the powers of the human spirit while highlighting forgiveness and reconciliation as major themes. Compared to her first feature 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' it is quite clear that Mrs. Jolie's sensibilities lie within horrific human events and the ability to extract a silver lining from within. Her lauded humanitarian efforts strike well within reach of why she chose to make this film. The screenplay lacks depth and is certainly not distinguishable Coen brothers work. The film is largely held up by O'Connell's performance, which is another fine example of this young actor's range and abilities. Focusing mainly on his performance is extremely satisfying if not gut wrenching."
"smatson123","6","6","15","27 December 2014"," An Extraordinary Story Shortchanged
","Imagine a bioflick about George Washington that goes something like this: 95% of screen time depicts the misery of crossing the Delaware to capture the British in mid winter. In the remaining few minutes, these statements flash on the screen: , ""after this, the British were defeated, and the Colonists ultimately won the war. Oh, right, and by the way, George went on to become the country's first President and immortalized as a Founding Father.""<br/><br/>""Unbroken"" suffers from the same skewed imbalance and misplaced priorities. Louis Zamperini is a hero, but why? It's an impressive starting place, both in Lauren Hillenbrand's intricately researched biography, and in the corresponding movie, that he overcame budding delinquency by running; that he became the fastest high school sprinter of his day; that he could catch and kill live shark barehanded from a life raft; and that he survived starvation and sadism in Japanese prison camps. But what sets Louis head and shoulders above other war veterans is something almost unbelievably extraordinary: his coming to terms with the cruelest imaginable enemies and actively working to forgive them. Yet, it's that essential fact that's relegated to a few written sentences at the end of Jolie's film. Wrong, wrong, wrong.<br/><br/>It's common knowledge that the Hollywood mainstream is uncomfortable with religious conviction--yet we know from Hillenbrand that Zamperini would not have survived and overcome his PTSD without it--and it's the heartbeat of his life story. Unfortunately the only reference to belief within the movie is Louis' spoken promise to God to make something of his life if he is allowed to live--and it's introduced almost as a throw away line. Further, real emotions and character change don't seem to be within Director Jolie's repertoire. The special effects, such as the air bombardments and raft scenes, are fine for the most part, and the details of boyhood are mostly accurate, but when we look for the man within the history lesson, we're given sensationalism instead. Not any statements or acting that might suggest a descent into pathological hatred of the sadistic Japanese camp commander, but instead almost endless scenes of whippings, beatings, broken bones, and head punches (which elicited groans, complaints and mutters from the audience in the showing I saw). Under the circumstances, his survival seems a result of athletic training and luck as much or more than any strength of character or personal belief.<br/><br/>A better movie would have started with Zamperini's marriage as it floundered,..the uncovering of the consequences of PTSD as rooted in war, flashbacks of survival on the raft and camps, a look at Zamperini's alcoholism, and finally, his journey towards healing and forgiveness. It would still be a lot to fit into two hours, but it would be coherent and relatable.<br/><br/>Want the real Zamperini? The end of the movie shows a glimpse-- a minute of happy footage of him running with the Olympic torch in Tokyo at age 80--fully healed and absolving of the past. But you can save yourself over two hours of dramatic but pointless action on the big screen up to that point by just bypassing the movie and going straight to You Tube."

","Unbroken was the best movie I've seen in ages. It is probably difficult to portray the intensity of the camp personnel and the detail but the focus was on LS and not the conditions of the camp. If anything was lost it was in feminizing the Japanese prison camp Corporal Watanabe who was probably more brutal in appearance at the time than Takamasa Ishihara is now, being that Takamasa looks more like a runway model for Japanese clothing than a prison camp guard. That's a casting issue.<br/><br/>And those who have never been in any military setting of any kind would also have difficulty understanding that there are always long periods of waiting in the military, so things can get drawn out. In a film, drawn out can get boring.<br/><br/>But other than that, this was the best movie I'd seen in ages. Ten Stars."
"mober1996","9","4","9","19 January 2015"," A brutal masterpiece
","""Unbroken"" is a brutal and terrifying story about a man basically getting abused for an extraordinary amount of time. Plane wrecks, stranded at sea for months, being captured by enemy soldiers where he is beaten and abused. It's scary. I couldn't manage going through everything that the protagonist went through. I would probably make it a fifth of the time that he made it through and then either lose my mind or just kill myself. He made it all the way through and still remained strong.<br/><br/>The correct thing done with this movie were the amounts of real emotion that they placed throughout the movie. Not really what they showed, but more what the audience felt. I could not stop thinking about how bad I felt for this guy throughout the entire movie. But at the same time, I simply couldn't look away. It kept pulling me in and kept making me upset but interested. I was constantly questioning what I would do in his spot. How I would react and behave to some of these situations what he went through. It was like one of those really sad commercials for the animal shelters. You feel so sad but you can't look away because then you feel like a hypocrite. The sadness and just sheer brutality of this film told the entire story throughout the duration of it.<br/><br/>There was only one problem with this movie. And that was the fact that I noticed that it was unnecessarily censoring stuff. Which, I guess, makes sense. But I feel like it hurt the experience just SLIGHTLY. It made slightly tough at times to immerse myself in some of the drama that was happening because I wasn't seeing what was actually happening. Immersion is a big part of the experience for me when it comes to movies, and the censoring made it only a little difficult to do that.<br/><br/>""Unbroken"" is a masterpiece of a drama. It has the perfect ability of not making you think ""Oh yeah, this guy is going through crap. I get it at this point."" It constantly keeps you interested and feeling the feels and is definitely worth watchingunless you only like comedy moviesthis movie is nowhere near lightly-toned. Final Review Score: 9/10"
"ryan_d_waters","5","4","9","28 December 2014"," Learn the story, but don't expect a life changing film
","With the two recent WW2 films that detail amazing individual stories ""The Railway Man"" and ""The Imitation Game"" I had very high hopes for this film to live in my memory long after I had seen the film and to stand the testament of time, however, much like the recent ""The Monuments Men"" I found it told an excellent story but a disappointing, forgettable film.<br/><br/>The main fault with this film is that I just never felt engrossed or connected with the suffering that Zamperini was supposed to have endured, for a number of reasons. Apart from a very strong start (and a very impressive opening aerial battle scene) the whole film felt incredibly one dimensional, as if I was watching one boring scene after another. That is no criticism of O'Connell whose performance was top draw, the fault lies with the direction or AJ in this case.<br/><br/>Up to the original capture location, the film brings about some reality, with Zamperini looking like death and being shipped off to Tokyo to endure the worst POW camp imaginable. However he then seems to arrive at a slightly run down summer camp with a teenage boy supporting a bamboo cane in charge. There is no real ""horror"" here, as morbid and as dark as that may sound on my part, the conditions are not particularly bad, with the camp doing exercise classes, moving wood around a few times and even watching a play put on by the prisoners. Zamperini looks clean shaven on most occasions. Compared to ""The Railway Man"" where I genuinely struggled to watch some of the scenes in the POW camps, due to the sick, violent acts of the guards, this felt like they were at boarding school with each other, guards and prisoners included.<br/><br/>The teenage boy I am referring to is ""The Bird"" who was dubbed the worst most evil POW commander in the history of Japan, some of the acts he was supposed to have performed do not even warrant mentioning on here, so naturally you expect someone you ACTUALLY would fear one way or another on screen.<br/><br/>What we get is Takamasa Ishihara, who just doesn't cut the mustard. His ""horrific"" acts simply boil down to a couple of whacks with the dreaded bamboo cane and couple of boots put in for good measure. I never would expect or want to see a Tarantino level of gore and suffering in a film like this but nothing he did really made me fear what was about to come. You learn that Zamperini is a tough bloke who can take a punch in the first five minutes so you don't need that proved a hundred times. It wasn't difficult to watch, just felt like it was repeating the same message over and over again.<br/><br/>At about the 1 hr 45 mark, around 5-6 people left the cinema out of boredom, I didn't think the film was THAT bad but you could see where they were coming from. When it moves onto the second POW camp, you feel as if it may take another turn but oh no, Japanese Justin Bieber shows up again with the stick of truth and Zamperini ""faints"" in fear. One of the weakest scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The film then slogs on for another 30 mins or so at the second POW camp and the whole formula is repeated. At this point I had given up caring and just wanted it to end because I knew nothing was going to change. I felt nothing for the characters at this point in the film at this point, only respect for O'Connell and Garrett Hedlund for clearly giving 110% performance efforts and being talented actors.<br/><br/>The finale set piece where he is holding the log above his head is one clearly made for suspense, and scenes where he slipped and stumbled was supposed to have the audience on the edge of their seats, gasping in fear of what may happen if he drops it. However, because we had seen nothing to fear from the guards at this point, no one really brought into it. All I felt like I was watching was a random man holding a log above his head for 5 minutes, not our hero on the edge of his teather, pushing the boundaries of human capabilities.<br/><br/>My point proved when the bird breaks out his extend able tooth pick again and knocks Zamperini down to the ground again, admitting defeat, having little emotional effect on anyone. The war is over and Zamperini returns home to his family. One of the only real emotional scenes that Im sure a few people have mentioned already, is the actual footage of Zamperini running at the Olympics in Japan at the age of 81. Huge respect for him for putting himself through that.<br/><br/>It almost feels as if AJ tried TOO hard to show her respect for Zamperini here, establishing his tough character and then feeling obliged to show this over and over again without actually trying to develop the character beyond this. It wouldn't be disrespectful to show him as a normal human after the war and how he would cope with returning to normal life, which Im pretty sure is a huge part of his story.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you don't know his story and don't want to read the book, go see it, if you know his story, maybe just catch this on DVD on a rainy Sunday as your not going to be blown away by AJ's attempt here. Please for god sake don't listen to reviews like ""A MUST SEE"" and ""BEST FILM OF THE DECADE"" as by all the mixed reviews, it isn't. One thing that is 99% consisted however is O'Connells strong performance which I completely agree with and hope his is in the running for the Best Actor category at next years Oscars."

There is absolutely no character development. You learn a total of two names the whole movie! I can't possibly imagine Zemperini himself would have given this ""movie"" more than 1 star. There is an obscene amount of development and crucial events left out of this film. All the heart and gut wrenching sections of the book are turned into a sloppy two second portrayal of entire chapters. I honestly think Angelina was sitting there thumbing through the book and thought ""oh, we better put this CRUCIAL event into the movie, um.

","I just wanted to warn people not to waste money on this film -it's truly tedious. Recently I've been very impressed by the acting of the lead, Jack O'Connell, in 'Starred Up' and ''71' - even 'The Liability' is pretty good. I was massively disappointed then to see his talent squandered on such a mediocre production. Couldn't Angela Jolie find an American Latino actor? The black hair and olive complexion didn't suit O'Connell. This film is vastly over-romanticised with an irritating score. All credit to the lead though - he did his best with it. According to his bio: O'Connell threw himself into the demands of the role, which included dropping his thick Midlands brogue, subsisting on 800 calories a day for months and enduring prison camp scenes so physically demanding he blacked out on set."

","""Punbroken"" is the story of how I got pun writer's block!! Wait, Wait don't leave! Angelina Jolie's ""Unbroken"" is based on the incredible true story of Olympian track runner Louis Zamperini. Louie Louie won full medal in the 1936 Olympics, and then went full metal by joining the armed forces. During his tour duty in World War II, Louie was involved in a plane crash that left him and two of his fellow patriotas in a life boat for close to two months. Louie was rescued from death on the lifeboat, but the bad news is that it was the enemy Japanese who did it; consequently, Louie was a prisoner of war in two concentration camps. Jolie directed ""Unbroken"" by mostly concentrating on the concentration camp, and lacked character development of her protagonist. The infamous Coen Brothers wrote the film's screenplay, and surprisingly so it was an ""uncoen""-like script that lacked ingenuity. Jack O' Connell did deliver a bravo performance as Zamperini. Also, there was some solid cinematography by the cine steady Roger Deakins. But those pluses were not enough to fully salvage and rescue ""Unbroken"" from the mediocre cinema concentration camp. *** Average"
"powermandan","3","3","6","12 January 2015"," I Was Fooled.
","I remember seeing previews and sneak-peaks for Unbroken, thinking that I would either love it or really like it. The trailers showed a young man winning track events then becoming a soldier. I love movies like that that cover lots of ground. I thought this would be the next Forrest Gump. I was fooled.<br/><br/>Unbroken is a failure at nearly all areas. First off, the first little bit that deals with his early years and track days were sloppy as could be. It alternates between him as a kid and him on a fighter plane in the war, with the plane bits adding to the sloppiness. Why not just wait to show the all the war scenes all at once? It's so much easier for the viewer to get and better to see that way. When his plane crashes and becomes stranded in the ocean for 45 days, that is when the sloppiness subsides, but the movie's greatness stays away. What made the first little bit so sloppy was it was full of just random bits randomly thrown in at random parts. Is it so hard for a situation to have things surrounding it and build-ups? I'm not saying for this movie to have suspense, actually, give it suspense! Make it exciting! Don't make it a straight-up thriller, but have build-ups and links that make for a better flow and an overall better viewing. The main character and two of his friends being stranded is when the movie starts getting a little better. For some reason, I found the whole chunk of the movie when they are stranded to be very well-done. Then computer-generated waves almost ruin the whole thing. Eventually, he gets saved and it taken to a POW camp where he gets singled out and exploited, ultimately turning into 12 Years A Slave 2.0. I thought where would be actual war sequences and not just random exploitation. I don't mind there being exploitation or anything, just as long it leads to something. Not just torture then he walks off and nothing happens!<br/><br/>Due to this movie being realistic and (I guess) doing justice to a guy's life, I must give credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>1/4"
"Seraphion","7","3","6","12 January 2015"," Inspiring survival story indeed
","The movie tells the story of Louie Zamperini, US Olympics track athlete, and his ordeal as a soldier in World War II. The movie starts with his job as an Air Force bombardier on a bomber crew with Phil and Cup, and a bombing mission that really damages their plane. It goes back and forth to flash backs about his childhood as the son of an Italian immigrant family, his introduction and advances in track running, and his first run in the Olympics. The crew gets another mission and replacement men for their fallen comrades, but no new plane. En route, the plane's engines fail and they dive into the ocean. Only three made it out alive from the crash; Louis, Phil and Mac; and they are stranded on the ocean for almost fifty days. They spot two planes flying over them, the first didn't see them while the second is a Japanese that shot at them. When rations thin out, they try to eat everything to survive from raw fish, seagull, to sharks. Then their salvation comes, but it's also a bad news since it's the Japanese, who then puts the into a POW camp in mainland Japan.<br/><br/>The commander of the camp is known as The Bird by the prisoners for he doesn't like the name they call him. The Bird is an erratic behaving corporal who grew up a rich kid and aspiring to be an officer but gets denied by the Japanese military and instead gets stuck in POW camps. He somehow taken a special interest in Louis making him a frequent target of his his does of cruel abuses, especially after he knows that Louis was an Olympic athlete. The Bird gets Louie to run against a Japanese, who wins easily due to Louie getting fatigued and malnourished along his time as a prisoner. The Japanese asked Louis to speak on a radio program, declaring he's alive and treated well by the Japanese. But he denies the second request to do so again as he's requested to say that he is betraying his country to live in Japan. He gets returned to the camp where The Bird makes the other prisoners punch his face once per person. <br/><br/>After that, The Bird personally says to Louis that he sees Louis as a strong man just like he is and he respects that by considering Louis as a friend. One time, The Bird personally comes to tell Louis that he is getting transferred to run another camp and asks Louis to congratulate him, but Louis keeps silent. But the Allies bombs the nearby city so the prisoners get transferred to another camp, which turns out to be a coal mine run by The Bird. The coal mine is located at steep hills so the prisoners have to climb up and down through many flights of stairs. Fatigue and stress weakens many of them that some even fall from the railings as they climb. One day The Bird demands Louis to lift a wooden beam and orders guards to shoot him if he drops it. He lifts it for a long time until The Bird himself gets annoyed by it and beats him severely. Finally the war ends and Louis gets flown home and reunites with his family.<br/><br/>The movie depicts a great true story of a man's survival. I'm quite amazed at this movie because it nicely depicts two survival events in one movie. For me it's like seeing a WWII multi person version of Robert Redford's All Is Lost and a movie like Empire of the Sun, back to back and with the same protagonist. The movie eve complete it's biographical aim with the nice flash backs of Louis' childhood and his track times. The initial sequence of the aerial bombing and subsequent airplane battle is really a good way to start this drama.<br/><br/>The part of the survival at sea is quite realistic as Angelina Jolie nicely directs this part to encompass many aspects of the condition of the sea. We get to see day and night, calm and storm, and also hope and disappointment when the planes fly over the men. One thing that for me feels like it's the least of the possibilities is when the seagull just comfortably lands on the raft. For an instance I laughed at this, and then thought that it might have come to the time when illusions start to take the men's minds away. <br/><br/>The prison camp part is also very nice. It's indeed a nice depiction of how brutal the Japanese can be on the war that I read in an article that some Japanese people actually protested at this film over those brutality depictions. Well, I find the protest really weird since they let it pass just okay with Colin Firth's The Railway Man which also depicts cruel things done by Japanese soldiers in the war.<br/><br/>The acting overall is a great work. It sees Jack O'Connell once again performed very well in portraying the various emotions and needed expressions, although I think that he has to work more on his American accent. Having Domnhall Gleeson also really helps in dramatizing the survival at sea part. It quite strange for me that Jai Courtney only takes a very insignificant part in this movie. Takamasa Ishihara has done very well in embodying the perfect antagonist for this movie. I'm quite sure we'll be seeing more of his acting in coming future.<br/><br/>Unbroken (2014) deserves a strong 7 out of 10 score from me, and a definite recommendation to go and see in the cinemas. A great entertainment depicting an inspiring true story of survival and steadfastness is surely a worthy watch at the movies."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Louis Zamperini was a true American hero and his life story is epic and legendary. The son of Italian immigrants, young Louie easily found trouble, and only the efforts of his older brother and a local police officer allowed him to discover inner strength through his talent for distance running. As a 19 year old, Louie ran in the 1936 Berlin Olympics, and later enlisted in the Air Force and served as a bombardier during WWII. After a horrible plane crash, he spent a grueling 47 days adrift at sea in a life raft, until rescued/captured by the Japanese. Zamperini served as a Prisoner of War, where he was subjected to immense physical and psychological torture, until the war finally ended.<br/><br/>Zamperini's story has long deserved to be made into a movie, and it has bounced around Hollywood since 1957. However, it wasn't until Laura Hillenbrand's biography on Zamperini became a best seller in 2010 that the film version was given the go-ahead. With screenplay credits for Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson, cinematography from the great Roger Deakins, and a score from Alexandre Desplat, it was a bit surprising when Angelina Jolie was named director. After all, she only had one previous credit as a director, and that film (In the Land of Blood and Honey, 2011) was nowhere near the scope of this project.<br/><br/>Given the true life inspirational story and the truly heroic events of its featured character, the film can best be labeled a mild disappointment. It is extremely impressive to look at, but somehow lacking in emotion  despite some excruciatingly uncomfortable moments. The film strives for the level of historic epic, yet its conventional tone and approach leave us wondering what's missing. The single most effective and emotional moment occurs in a short clip of the real Louis Zamperini running as an Olympic torch bearer at age 80 for the 1998 Olympics (in Japan!).<br/><br/>Jack O'Connell pours everything he has into capturing the spirit of Zamperini, and he is certainly an actor to keep an eye on. Japanese rock star Miyaki plays ""The Bird"" Watanabe, a sadistic POW camp commander who brutalized Zamperini, but Miyaki lacks the chops to pull off this crucial role – going a bit heavy on the posturing. The film uses the line ""If you can take it, you can make it"" as its rallying cry, but too many gaps are left for the audience to bridge as we watch Louie go from a punk kid to a war hero with almost mystical courage and perseverance. Other supporting work comes from Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund, Jai Courtney and CJ Valleroy (as young Louie).<br/><br/>On paper, all the pieces are in place for an Oscar contender, and the film may very well play well with voters. My preference would have been to have the real life Louis Zamperini more involved  through either narration or interviews. He spent the second half of his life as a motivational speaker and story-teller, and would have added an incredible element to the film. Unfortunately, Mr. Zamperini died 4 months prior to the release of the film so he never saw the finished product. It's likely he died knowing that his legacy is part of American history and that he did in fact ""make it""."

Cinematography by a legendary Roger Deakins (who was nominated for 12 Oscars in his carrier!) is superb, gorgeous, capturing everything from wide and tight angles and has this classical feel of the movies - ""Unbroken"" has to witnessed on the big screen. The actors, who most are little known did a great job. When you have this kind of material and this caliber of people in front and behind the camera, it's a difficult job to fail, and a second time director Angelina Jolie does a descent job in keeping the pacing so well, that at the running time 2 h 14 min this movie almost never drags and is very good.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Unbroken"" is a superbly told magnificent true story. It has all the right ingredients for a good movie, and good movie it is. It's very inspiring and shows that you must never let go, no matter how bad things can look, there is always an answer to everything."

","The expectations I had going in weren't really anything special, because of that ""Unbroken"" did partly surprise me, but all in all I what I was expecting going in was more or less what I had when I left the theater.<br/><br/>I want to start by addressing a thing that has bothered me for quite some time and that this movie finally convinced me to right down. I am fu**ing sick and tired of true story movies that manage to gain emotional punch only by ending the movie with real life pictures and closing sentences. It really frustrates me when they do so and madly manipulate me, whilst they aren't giving quality character empathy where they should. ""Unbroken"" fits right into this category since its main and core weakness is the absence of emotional connection throughout. You really do care for Louie in parts, but for the majority of the duration the only reasons you are given to care for him are badly handled clichés or torture porn. Which brings me to my next point. I am the only one who actually felt this was torture porn? I understand the necessity to feel the stress Louie went through and boy do I feel devastated by only thinking of it, but conveying it in a movie is a whole other thing and showing an hour to an hour and a half of torture certainly isn't the right way. Which again, brings me to my other point: this film in no way whatsoever manages to justify its length and instead makes it even more heavy to get through. Wiliam Goldberg might be my favourite editor in the business right now, but this isn't in no way great work from him, obviously the technicality of the editing is brilliant as always but the pace is so off putting.<br/><br/>I have heard many blame Jolie for poor direction and whilst this isn't exactly a brilliant directing piece, it certainly isn't a weak one, on the contrary there are moments where the vision really shines, I really want to see more from her, because her passion really came through despite some weaknesses. She is obviously helped by the gorgeous cinematography by the great Roger Deakins. I point my finger towards the script, being the main weakness of the film for my money. Yet, talking more about strengths the movie certainly has some: performances across the board are remarkable, with the only exception of the Japanese officer maybe, who had his moments, but also became the weak link in others. Moreover, the first hour or so of ""Unbroken"" is very, very good and promised me a movie that I unfortunately failed to get.<br/><br/>I did have a positive experience with the film, which gives a remarkable portrayal of this true story, but all in all, as I am thinking back towards it, I do find many flaws with it and think I won't really remember the movie itself as much as the incredible story."
"squirrel_burst","7","3","7","28 January 2015"," Not as emotional as it should be, but there's a lot of good content within
","I've heard people had mixed feelings about ""Unbroken"", and I do have to admit that it doesn't really pack the emotional punch that it should, but it is a story worth seeing. You should try and catch this drama if only because its like 4 tales jam-packed into 1. Based on true events, it's the story of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (played by C.J. Valleroy as a child and Jack O'Connell as an adult). He was an Olympic runner for the United States in 1936 (a pretty big feat all in itself) who overcame adversity when he and two friends found themselves stranded in the middle of the Pacific ocean for months... only to be ""rescued"" by the Japanese and sent to POW camps.<br/><br/>This movie has got so much going on in it I'm surprised they didn't pull a ""Hobbit"" and split it up into 4. First we've got the rise of an underdog, a kid who's up to no good and whose life is spinning out of control who rises to become an Olympic athlete. Those kinds of stories make it to the silver screen all of the time and they're always at least a little bit heartwarming to see. Next, we have the story of survival. Louie and his friends are stuck in the middle of the ocean with few supplies, little hope and plenty of sharks in the water. Think running out of food is a problem? How about becoming food? Think ""Life of Pi"", but with less tiger. Then we've got the whole POW camp thing, with our hero being mercilessly tormented by Mitsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe (Japanese singer-songwriter Miyavi). Finally, the film concludes with the aftermath of the war and what it meant to the people in that camp and Louie's family. What I liked about the movie is that it kept changing. It felt like real life because you never knew what was going to happen next and it wasn't one grand adventure that wrapped itself up cleanly, it was one catastrophe after another. I liked the fact that this was a real uphill battle. It's filled with seemingly insurmountable odds for our hero to tackle. Seeing a spirit determined to keep on going being tested like this, it's exhilarating.<br/><br/>While at its core, this movie is about not giving up and always hoping for the best, I also found another pertinent element to it, one that's more subtle and is only said explicitly at the very end of the movie... kind of. The bulk of this film is set during WWII. Despite the fact that you can easily pick out which sides of the conflict were ""good"" and which side was ""Evil"", this movie made me look past the black-and-white element of this war. I think the film is an argument for not judging people, particularly when they are in a situation where you have to become a different type of person to survive. Let me give you an example. Our hero is being tormented by the officers in the Japanese prisoner of war camp. It's incredibly infuriating to see him being so unfairly mistreated. You see some people take less punishment than him, and give up. Your instinct would be to get angry over the quitters, and I suppose I did, but in retrospect, I feel like I'm unfit to judge them. War is a horrible thing. It forces people that would never hurt a fly to kill each other and it steals away innocence. When it comes to survival, this movie has both aspects covered. It's got sequences where people will do absolutely ANYTHING in order to survive. It's also got scenes where people refuse to back down from their code of ethics, even if it means suffering or even dying. I felt like ""Unbroken"" made a conscious effort to show that the good guys and the bad guys weren't just black-and-white caricatures of evil Japanese soldiers and brave American heroes. They were people who had the extremely poor fortune of being born in a time where being yourself wasn't an option because of the war. If anything, the movie argues for compassion and looking past nationalities and roles in a conflict and leaving the past behind in order to move on. I've been blessed because I've never had to experience war, so the best I can do is watch a movie like ""Unbroken"" and wonder how I would react to the atrocities these soldiers had to experience. I enjoyed placing myself in the shoes of Louie. Faced with these kinds of challenges, would I be able to muster up the same kind of courage that he did? This movie got inside my head and I have been thinking about it a lot, so I recommend that you see it. That said, I can't deny that it isn't as moving as it should be. I would have been moved if ANYONE had endured what Louie did, so in this case, the events in the film far supplant the characters. It is an emotional experience, but mostly because anyone would have a hard time seeing a human being mistreated in the way that Louie is. I liked the movie, I was glad I saw it, but I've seen lives that were much less eventful be made into far more moving films. One last note, you're probably wondering how hardcore the scenes of torture are in this film. They're really not that extreme. There are no racks, or thumbscrews or anything like that, it's mostly just people being hit and demoralized through constant mistreatment. No ""Hostel"" business at all. A PG rating is a bit of a stretch, but even pre-teens could watch this film and not be traumatized by it if accompanied by an adult and given a discussion on the themes of the story. I liked ""Unbroken"" a lot, but it's more of a good film than a great one. (Theatrical version on the big screen, January 13, 2015)"
"oragex","5","3","7","13 January 2015"," 'The Passion of the Christ' --- the Angelina Jolie version
","Maybe Angie should hook up with Mel? They both seem attracted to depicting deep human suffering on the screen. I can say, she didn't got the message from the critics of 'The Passion of the Christ'. Please allow me reiterate this message: no matter how hard the moments in someone's life have been, what is the reason to bring this violence on the screen? What does it help to prove/understand? Is public display of real life violence needed? The fact that someone went trough hell, is it a reason to publish it? Is it beneficial in any way? There, of course, might be other explanations for this movie. Someone wants to show us how to be resilient, or even how far the human nature can survive. Or even that no matter what, we have to forgive.<br/><br/>I believe a personal story of horror must remain personal in its intimate dimension of what an individual/group of individuals have suffered. Because such suffering has no meaning and no logic. The fact people went through and survived is all in their honor. But not a reason of publishing it.<br/><br/>Finally, I hope, just hope, Angelina is not trying to show us here how we should be resilient in life. Because if this was her intention, she must be one individual that is measuring things in an extreme way. Despite the fact the story of the movie is real, by no means this should be taken as an example of how to get through life. The story behind the movie is just too extreme.<br/><br/>On the other side, why doesn't the movie show that Louis went into alcohol and depression after the war, yet recovered and started preaching God and forgiveness while being able to completely and sincerely forgive the sadistic commandant? Now that's a human achievement Angelina should have presented in more detail in it's movie.<br/><br/>The same movie could have been made in a much softer way, without the atrocity in all of it's details. And could have had perhaps a better impact on the public."
"drawlife","6","3","7","5 January 2015"," Jolie tries, but it feels rehashed.
","I haven't seen Angelina Jolie's previous efforts in her directorial career. But for the most part I didn't hate this film, but it feels very familiar in a lot of ways. <br/><br/>Jack O'Connell portrays Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, a US Olympian and a US Army bombardier. His plane eventually crashes into the ocean and is stranded for 47 days, with only two crewman Mac and Phil, respectively portrayed by Finn Wittrock and Domhnall Gleeson. He is then captured by the Japanese empire and is tortured and abused by Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe, played by Takamasa Ishihara.<br/><br/>The opening act, provides us with sincere and engaging flashbacks, then we get a series of been there and done that clichés. When they are stranded it provides a Cast Away vibe, but it does provide some amusing moments where they capture a bird, a shark, and a fish for food. We move to the second act where they are captured by the Japanese, Louis is separated to a different concentration camp and there he gets tortured by the Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe. This is where Angelina Jolie looses the focus of the film and gets very one noted. <br/><br/>Though the scenes where Louis is tortured and physically abused by his rival ""The Bird,"" is quite impactful, there are one too many and at a certain point it begins to feel old and also feels very overkill. I did some research before on his life and the book, and the script does not measure up. The transition of spiritual awakening and strength in God Louis discovers does not translate well on the big screen, and to be quite frank I don't recall even a mention or a nod to that. Upon viewing this film I couldn't help but notice that this film has a very Clint Eastwood vibe. This film is something I think Clint Eastwood probably could have directed and its as if Angelina Jolie was taking notes while she was working with him on Changeling(which is a movie I'd recommend). <br/><br/>The acting is fine. Everyone is good here, particularly Jack O'Connell. He does a great job with what he's given with. I haven't seen much of his other works, but he carries the film quite well. Domhnall Gleeson as Phil provides a decent supporting role, as is Garrett Hedlund as John Fitzgerald has decent moments here and there. Takamasa Ishihara who portrays ""The Bird,"" does a good job with the role he's given with, but he's just a typical, ruthless Japanese sergeant. <br/><br/>With that being said, the acting can only cover up the characterization these characters so far, in way they're kinda flat. We don't really see the struggle that they're dealing with besides a few lines and dialog about it. I didn't at all feel totally connected with anyone in the film. As a matter of fact, Louis's flashbacks are the only thing that actually comes close to humanizing anyone in the whole film. <br/><br/>Jolie tries, I commend her for that, but it's too familiar and too one noted. I didn't even get any theme of forgiveness, which I believe Jolie stated in an interview somewhere that this film is about forgiveness. It rather explains all this at the end in the form of title cards. <br/><br/>To sum it up, Unbroken is mediocre film at best, sprinkled with some decent moments. Picture a terrible, undercooked cake batter, but with a thin layer of tasty frosting that sort of makes up for the batter.<br/><br/>6.6/10"
"rbf10","5","3","7","29 December 2014"," A Missed Opportunity
","First, let it be said that the book ""Unbroken"" would be a hard act for anyone to follow. This true WWII adventure of Olympic track star Louie Zamperini turned soldier had all the ingredients to be a great film....misspent youth to great athlete to war hero to the crumbling emotional aftermath and finally to redemption. That said there was a one-dimensional quality about the movie version of the great Louie Zamperini. Yes, he survives an unimaginable weeks floating through the shark infested Pacific Ocean and subsequently endures unimaginable barbaric tortures at the hands of a sadistic prison warden nicknamed the ""Bird"" by the POW's. The scenes of cruelty and inhumanity become redundant because this is all we see. The usually flawless Cohen Brothers didn't finish their story. The movie basically concludes when the war is over and the audience is treated to a paragraph or two of synopsis of Zamperini's remaining 70 plus years. The movie fails to capture, convey, transfuse to the audience the internal turmoil and mental damage Zamperini experienced through two years of torture. The book describes a returning war hero so riddled with guilt and hate for his wartime persecutor that he is obsessed with returning to Japan to murder the ""Bird"". Besieged with nightmares he drinks heavily. He trains to return to the Olympics but his injured ankle collapses and ends that dream. After he embraces religion at a Billy Graham evangelical gathering and is able to forgive his former torturers, Zamporini shares his journey as a motivational speaker. By the predominant focus on the horrors of war, the film misses the opportunity to shape this wonderful protagonist to the multi faceted person he became. What a pity only part of the meal was served."
"Lemonhead4094","5","3","7","29 December 2014"," Too much invested as viewer: Conclusion lacking
","I have do say that Jolie's directing was rather good. My issues was with the writing and the screenplay. Very accurate and true to the life events of Louis Zamperini during WWII. I felt the use of flashbacks in the beginning done quite strategically well and helped move through transitions smoothly. It was downhill from here as the tale of his encampment in a Japanese POW prison took over. Although intense and tactfully filmed and written, it drew out too long in relation to the conclusion. All the evil and pain suffered in this act of the show did have me invested in the conclusion. Here, the transitions became rather drawn out and clumsy. Then, a rather short scene when the end of imprisonment came.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I feel the conclusion was, to me, similar to the wrapping of a white elephant gift, no big deal. With a few short sentences and a brief clip of Louis 70 years later, a large part of the life story (and the most important, in my opinion) is not given respect or credence. I felt to have invested so much in the man and his trials they were cheapened by a quip of a conclusion.<br/><br/>This movie is entertaining but be prepared for the let down of being unable to celebrate a Tolkien ""eutastrophe"" (as he would put it) and have ingrained in the viewer only despair and torment with little reward of a joyful victory, which in Louis' life, was to occur decades later in his challenging path to forgive his tormentors."
"JohnPaulG07","7","5","15","27 December 2014"," Intense Recreation of WWII Hero
","Unbroken is a very interesting and intellectual film about the trials and tribulations of a WWII veteran. The movie at first is almost an inspirational battle between the hero and himself. As the film progresses this inspiration takes a tremendous turn. The hero as his success amounts begins to show a survival instinct that plays a part in the whole film. The movie in its entirety is a brutal reminder of the reality that this individual despite his talent and bravery was forced to endure. A lot of the scenes were truly heartbreaking in that although his situation and consequences were severe and even at times unfair, he was able to surmount these with an unquenched spirit. Towards the final scenes of the film this reality he created for himself began to pay off. Although he did survive at the end of the movie, despite numerous attempts by his enemy to do otherwise, he brought back a tear jerking tale of oppression and survival despite all odds. Hence the name ""Unbroken""."
"d-steels23","6","4","11","25 December 2014"," Great date night film- Not so 'inspiring' (possible spoilers?)
","Unbroken starts very promising, a bit cliché and Forrest Gump like, but also a great and new sort of feel. Louis is actually a likable character and his brother Pete even more so (one of the main reasons this movie was disappointing) When the bad times start to roll upon our protagonist flashbacks to childhood and his family and home start to happen, all which I thoroughly enjoyed. This is then abandoned once Louis is in the camp and settled in and then we endure a good last hour and a half of him simply being beaten and mistreated, yes of course this is the point of this film and yes it is a true story. It is also a movie and I feel like the abandoning the family and the brother Pete after them being the strong points in the beginning killed it for me. He was perceived as amazingly tough and strong willed, very small credits given to God when in reality it was the main thing that supposedly got the real Louis through. No flashbacks, no prayers, no anything just Louis being amazingly strong mentally and physically which came off too unrealistic to me. Great acting, very likable characters, not enough substance. This didn't live up to the hype for me but a good watch nonetheless for a random date night."

"zkonedog","2","2","4","4 March 2017"," A Soulless Film Devoid Of Any Meaning (And That's Really A Shame)
","When I read Laura Hillenbrand's ""Unbroken"" novel, it was a visceral experience...perhaps the most power non-fiction book I've read in my entire life. I'll never forget the name Louis Zamperini because of it. Sadly, this film adaptation of Louis' story tells only the most generic form of the story possible. All the real emotion and raw power of the story is excised.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Unbroken"" is the story of Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), an Olympic runner who joins the military (eventually becoming a bombardier) to serve his country during World War II. While on a rescue mission, Louis' plane is shot down, forcing he and two fellow soldiers to spend over a month on a floating life-raft. They are finally rescued...by the Japanese military, who bring them to a camp occupied by a sadistic leader known as ""The Bird"" (Takamasa Ishihara). A trip through the coal mines also ensues, and Louis has multiple occasions where he could be nearing his mental and physical breaking point.<br/><br/>The reason ""Unbroken"" fails so miserably, however, is that my brief description above is actually more exciting than anything that happens in the film itself. Basically, it is just a ""collection of events"" in a general sense. One thing happens, then another thing happens, and so on and so forth. The emotional underpinnings that tie all the events together in the novel are completely absent. I'm not exactly sure why this is (especially with a screenplay written by the usually-solid Coen Brothers), but it likely comes from the direction of second-time director Angelina Jolie. Either Jolie cut out the meat of the story due to her own personal biases, or she just isn't polished enough yet behind the camera to know exactly what she is doing. Either way, the result is a film without a soul.<br/><br/>Also not helping this effort is that there is not a single truly great acting performance to be found. O'Connell as Louis is ""just okay"", but even then there doesn't seem to be much brewing underneath the surface of the performance. None of the supporting cast stick out whatsoever.<br/><br/>One final glaring mistake: Jolie chooses to not cover (besides a few captions at the end) the end of Zamperini's life which, to me, is the most emotional hard-hitting part of the whole story. In case you haven't read the novel, this is where Louis struggles with terrible post-traumatic stress and basically hits rock bottom in alcoholism. After joining a Billy Graham crusade and giving his life to Christianity, he then makes a journey back to Japan to try and find ""The Bird"" and come to terms with his wartime experiences. To not show this in the film is a crime, IMHO.<br/><br/>Viewing this movie was actually quite sad to me, as I know how much better it could have been made. If this version of the story is the only time you hear about Louis Zamperini, it will fade from your memory rather quickly, a shame considering how truly inspiring the man's story is. Instead of diving headfirst into the gritty, visceral issues that shape Louis' story, Jolie pulls too many punches and tries to create almost a family-film environment (released over the holidays, very little actual war violence compared to actual events, etc). This creates the most general movie experience possible, I have no respect for that approach to film-making."
"estebangonzalez10","7","2","4","25 January 2015"," A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory. Or is it the other way around?
","""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory.""<br/><br/>Directed by Angelina Jolie, Unbroken focuses on the inspiring true story of Olympic winning medalist, Louis Zamperini, who later went on to serve during World War II going through all kinds of hardships. Unbroken opens with an incredibly strong action scene (which might be the best in the movie) and as the story unfolds we get some flashbacks of Louis's childhood and upbringing. It is a bit formulaic in the sense that it follows pretty much the same conventions as most biopics have done in the past. One of my favorite quotes in the film is when Louis's brother tells him that ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" but ironically after getting through this film the quote feels like it works better the other way around, ""A moment of glory is worth a lifetime of pain"" because Jolie makes sure we witness all the trials that he went through during the War. She focuses more on Louis's lifetime of pain and only a moment of glory. Unbroken is The Passion of the Christ of war dramas because we experience the hardships that Louis has to go through in a very detailed manner. There is no doubt in my mind that this was an inspirational story, but Jolie spends most of her time going from one scene to the next without ever trying to develop the character or tell us who Louis really was. In other words she tells an inspiring story but doesn't transmit anything about the man who went through it all. There are several reasons why I did enjoy this film despite its flaws and the first one is because of Roger Deakins's cinematography which is always outstanding. I could see pretty much any movie that this man shoots. The second reason is because the Coen brothers were involved in the adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling novel. The Coen brothers aren't as successful when they don't direct their own screenplays, but this time they had strong material to work with. Hillenbrand is a great writer (Seabiscuit and now Unbroken) and the story is inspirational so there is a lot to like. <br/><br/>The film hooked me from the opening scene where we experience a great action scene from within a bomber aircraft overflying the Pacific Ocean. Then the generic flashbacks began and the film lost some of its potential. Jack O'Connell plays the lead character Louis Zamperini. After his solid performance in Starred Up, O'Connell, is definitely someone worth keeping your eyes on because he's extremely talented. In Unbroken we see him enduring a great amount of suffering (thus the comparison with The Passion of the Christ) so the film focuses on that aspect instead of giving us any insight on O'Connell's character. I still think the story is so inspirational that it manages to hook us and captivate us throughout the entire run time. Jolie is interested in simply telling the story so we go from one scene to the next without learning much of who the character's really are. The opening was fantastic, the scene where the plane crashes into the Ocean and the survivors struggle to survive was also another highlight of the film, and finally the torture he endures as a prisoner of war was inspiring. The technical aspects of the film are fantastic and Deakins cinematography is gorgeous. The supporting performances from Domhnall Gleeson and Miyavi are also very solid. But by the time the end credits start rolling you kind of wish the film had focused on the later aspects of Louis's life which were perhaps even more inspiring than the torture he endured."

"nealoade","6","0","0","7 March 2020"," Not a fun film
","Absolute respect to Louis Zamperini who by all accounts has a story so ridiculously packed with misfortune, luck and mountains to climb that many have speculated if it's really possible to create a film about this man, who died at the grand age of 97 in the same year of this film's release. I'm going to exercise all of my self restraint and not make the obvious joke about him dying of boredom watching this film.<br/><br/>The first issue is the run-time, at 2 and a half hours of Prisoner of War Camp with no letting up is a real slog. Seriously, The Deer Hunter is less of a slog than this and that's similar material, and for over 3 hours. I was going to deep dive on my issues but after such a long film, I'm just gonna save us both time and talk more generally on the film as a whole.<br/><br/>There's just a lot to take in when you're depicting inhuman events that really happened. These events you expect to see shown in a human way, ramped up to 11 at just the right time, but instead 'Unbroken' looks like a fever dream that is populated by actors who seem unclear on what they're doing.<br/><br/>I say this for two reasons. The Fever Dream - I'm not sure how to put this but - there is seemingly no weather in this film (it only rains when it impacts the plot, the rest is glowing sunshine), which gives the very real events depicted an unsuited uncanny valley/Truman Show vibe.<br/><br/>As for the supporting cast, I didn't get a solid sense of characterisation from anyone other than Louis Zamperini, and I found some of the acting to be misdirected, which left me wondering if nuances in the script were at times, lost.<br/><br/>This was a Christmas movie, and I think I know why. Jolie approaches the material with all the bible-thumping zeal of an Evangelist. ""Repent!"" she cries, ""Repent!"" as she lays yet another misdeed onto the laundry list of misdeeds visited upon Zamperini.<br/><br/>Compare this to films like 27 Hours, which while not the same scale of misery, it interspersed its more gruelling scenes of horror and fear amongst the beautiful ones of a life that lead up to those awful moments - pacing. It was effective because it highlighted parallels between ""then"" and ""now"" in the film that were poignant, it gave you a break and it heightened the emotion via contrasting it. That process is non-existent in this film.<br/><br/>I hate to say it but I think the problem with this film is one related to class. This movie was not made to entertain, it smacks of that sombre Puritan vibe of American Thankgiving, ""sorry for the killing but thanks for this turkey which we killed because we killed all of you"". Jolie may feel the need to repent at Christmas time, being a highly monied individual, from a highly monied family, but Mrs. Gary Nobody who works six days a week in Tesco or Walmart and only has Christmas Day off to spend with the kids, doesn't need such a self-flaggelating experience as the one delivered by Unbroken."

","I'm a bit late for the ""debate"" of Jolie becoming a director, I know. This movie is after all 6 years old by now. But, I don't understand why Jolie got so much hate for trying to direct. I asume it has to be about ""know your place"" kind of thing.<br/><br/>No, this is not a masterpiece of a movie and the best movie ever made. And Jolie doesn't deserve to be praised to the heavens, win an Oscar and later perhaps become the first female president of the USA, I mean, who knows, might happen. Perhaps starting a whole new age with a nation of female superpower. Where the feminine is ruling over the masculine. Up is down, black is white. And males are slaves to the females, cheap workforce and nothing else, building the women's world and empire, for them. And the males with best genes, are kept in stock, in certain constructed confined settlements just made for them, to be taken out and used only as sex slaves and their ""special juice"" for reproduction, when needed. The new world order. Where females rules as a superior class and males are just to be used for their bodies. I don't think we actually have to really fear this happening. Even though how likely it might sound.<br/><br/>Yes, Jolie is a women. Yes, she's a famous, successful, rich, actress. And all of a sudden she wants to direct. Who does she think she is? For starters, does she not know how privledge she already is? She should just be happy and contempt with her successful acting career. Not wanting to direct. Why should we, the viewers, be forced to watch her attempt to be a creator of the vision for an whole movie?<br/><br/>Well, while valid points. I have to review this movie for what it is in its final form, besides all that other stuff. And... it's actually pretty good. Strong story, very much worth telling, since it's based on reality. I'm glad someone made a movie about it. Is it the best movie ever made? No. Is it the best war movie ever made? No. But, I have to say, that personally, it really moved me. And it was well shot and well acted. It's a solid 7 for me. A movie that is good to watch when you need some inspiration going trough hard times perhaps. Which is not a bad thing at all. I can't actually see anything horrible wrong with it. The scope of the movie is actually pretty big and executed very well. People involved, that Jolie brought together, knew what they were doing and manged to do something (while not the greatest piece of cinema ever made) something worth seeing, to the least. So, why should Jolie not direct? I really don't get it."

Louie lived by the motto, ""If I can take it, I can make it,"" not my first choice for a life motto. Apparently it is his spirit that was ""Unbroken"" as they broke his body and damaged his mind. He was held captive by ""The Bird"" (Takamasa Ishihara) a man who talked to Louie like a dysfunctional lover saying, ""Don't look at me."" to the point nausea.<br/><br/>At one point the troops are moved and as a bombardier, Louie had to personally see the damaged his kind caused, but there was no emotional, ""what have we done"" scene.

It was very formulaic throughout and really lacked creativity in certain areas of the story. Jack O'Connell was good and is a good actor but there was a distinct lack of development with any of the other characters and no real chemistry. What we have here is a great true story.

I don't want to spoil much, but the events of the war that are focused on are pretty interesting and more or less unique. By unique I mean that these weren't events or stories that have really been focused on in war movies, or at least I haven't seen many like this. <br/><br/>The performances are all good, but two in particular stand out: Jack O'Connell and Miyavi. Miyavi in particular as a Japanese leader in a prisoner of war camp. He's evil, he's abusive, but he's human, and especially towards the end he brings just that to his character. <br/><br/>Something that particularly stood out was the make-up and physical appearance of many of the characters. When the soldiers were starved, they looked starved, when they were injured, they looked injured. Every one of them looked the part all the time, and that was just another awesome visual aspect of the film. <br/><br/>Overall Unbroken is a great movie.

Ms. Jolie knows how to best present human emotions, her actors do not waste time with melodramatic antics.

With Unbroken her second feature as a director(her first being In The Land of Blood and Honey)she turns the undeniable inspiring true story of Louie Zamperini into an old-fashioned survival drama. The story is based on a novel adapted by A-list writers(Richard LaGravenese, William Nicholson, and Joel and Ethan Coen), kicks off with a dazzling sense of immediacy. We're thrown into the belly of a bomber as Zamperni(Jack O'Connel) and his crew take fire from Japanese fighters. It's a hell of an opening sequence. It's gorgeously shot and beautifully acted, and it has it's moments of heartbreaking poignancy. I will admit I did cry during this picture on several occasions especially when Louie was in prison camp. He was punched by his inmates at least once. This is a special film that talks about spirit and forgiveness. Louie when he was young was the most hated in his town. But he became an inspiration to everyone in his hometown by the help of his brother. He believed that if his brother believed he could do it that he can take whatever life throws at him so he could make it. I've had a rough year I was lied to by a girl I desired, I met two girls fell in love with them but now they're gone and I'm going to an alternative school because I'm failing. However I still talk to both those girls and if they love and believe in me then I can take it and I will make it. I give Unbroken a five out of five."

","The movie 'Unbroken', set during World War II, is a true story of a man who survived horrendous and unimaginable things by sheer willpower and determination. Produced and directed by Angelina Jolie and starring Jack O'Connell in the lead role as Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, a US Olympic athlete who later joined as US aircraft bombardier, this film revolves around the long series of hardships faced by the protagonist during World War II and how he overcame them, thus portraying the resilience of human spirit.<br/><br/>There were several scenes and instances in the movie which shows how strong the willpower of Louie is. One of them was during the German Olympics of 1936 when he managed to come 8th from almost last in 5000m setting a record for fastest time in last lap. Another one was during World War II when he was a prisoner of war in Japan. He was forced to lift a giant piece of wood for pausing from his work in coal mine by a cruel Japanese corporal. The corporal had ordered a guard to shoot Louie if he dropped the plank. But he managed to lift and hold the plank up for hours which made the corporal angry and beat him badly.<br/><br/>This movie really inspires us to have faith in ourselves and stay unbroken in hard times. We should fight it till the end even if it seems there is no way to make it. Miracles do happen. As Louie's brother says, 'A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory!'."

The acting is lousy, the cinematography is uninspired, the score is stereotypical and overly romanticized, the costumes and sets are sterile reproductions that harm the films realism almost as much as its unimpressive CGI, the writing is atrocious, the traditional Hollywood pastiche of airbrushed patriotism is tiresome, and the direction is horrendous.

"paulg-67221","4","0","0","27 May 2016"," Unbroken is a broken film
","Despite looking great this film is very bland. The film seemed to me that it was trying to be beautiful rather than accurately portray the horrors of war. I feel the film held back, in one scene a American POW is what with a stick by a Japanese guard however, the beating is off-screen. I feel had the beating been on-screen then the film would benefit from showing the brutality of prison camps in WWII.<br/><br/>The main Japanese guard was one-dimensional. There were absolutely no redeeming qualities about him. It is very black and white. It shows the evil of the Japanese guards but paints the main character as a saint. At the end of the film it states Louie (the main character) struggled with PTSD and eventually turned to Christianity and forgave his captors. What it doesn't tell you is that he also battled alcoholism and only gave up because his wife threatened to leave him. A film that pops to mind to compare this film to is My Way. While both films are sentimental, My Way had at least the courage to show the brutal side of war and POW camps and show that their are decent and horrible people on both sides of war. At least in My Way the characters eventually learn to respect each other and their relationship develops throughout the film. In this movie, it seems Louie respects the main guard but no reason is given to actually earn any respect.<br/><br/>The title is false. The main character is clearly broken. About an hour in when he is first captured, he soon freaks out in his small cell. Coupled with the fact that the movie even states he suffered with depression, war did clearly break him. This movie tries to be so inspirational but it fails to do even that.<br/><br/>It's a nice looking film that tries to be inspirational. However, it's holding back and feels dishonest. Yeah, it may be pretty but I would rather have a war film that doesn't hold back like Full Metal Jacket than a film that glosses over war in favour of looking pretty.<br/><br/>6/10 (I would rate it lower but the cinematography is good so it would feel unfair to give it a lower rating.)<br/><br/>Edit: After some thought, I have concluded that a 5/10 is fairer and more accurate as the cinematography is the only thing going for this film, everything else is sub-par.

And I actually could not understand why Lui confronted Watanabe so passionately. He wasn't the person who could change the system there, provoking Watanabe was just stupid, not heroic act. He could keep his mouth shut and be safe. And I think nobody got Watanabe's point, Miyavi played the character excellent by the way. Watanabe just wanted to be priced, even by the enemy American soldier. They say only weak person is able to do violence against someone else. Lui's insubordination made him mad but the fact Lui never shown even little respect to him was the big deal. And the ridiculous thing was he never gained anything from it.

On the outbreak of the war, he is serving in the Air Force when his plane is shot down, and he and his two co-pilots are forced to survive, alone and stranded in the sea in a dinghy for forty five days. But this is just the beginning of their nightmare, before they are captured and held as prisoners of war, by the vicious Watanabe (Miyavi) and his army. Against incredible odds, Louis finds the strength to persevere and emerge triumphant against Watanabe's cruelty.<br/><br/>If something is going to get a glossy, big screen Hollywood showboating, then far better that it's an inspirational, true life tale than just another loud, mindless 'popcorn' flick, with everything to offer the eye but nothing to offer the mind. And in the tale of Louis Zamperini, Angelina Jolie has certainly found a lot of interesting source material to derive from, charting not only his Olympic victory before the war, but also his drawn out struggles in the yacht, and then his trials and tribulations in the POW camp. Sadly, the execution is more Hallmark TV special than big screen epic.<br/><br/>Quite how Jolie has taken so much interesting, potential laden story fodder and made it all so unaffecting is just baffling. Everything just plays out so mundanely, with the most flat, stilted dialogue that makes it feel more suited to a smaller scale TV production than the big screen. Performances wise, it's pretty much all resting on O'Connoll, who carries everything (literally, at the end) and serves as the driving force of the film. He doesn't do a bad job, but you're always on eggshells waiting to see when his American accent falters and his native Derby comes piping back to the surface. That said, Miyavi also has presence as the cold, cruel commander.<br/><br/>Overall, though, this is just an unfortunate let down. **"

","'Unbroken' is a tough film to sit through. I've seen characters have a rough time in films before (Donnie Wahlberg's character in the 'Saw' series had an immensely tough time of things), but when you know the film is based on a true story, and if anything is telling the light version of what actually happened, it's pretty tough to think about. I wasn't sure what to expect from Angelina Jolie as an only second time director, but was pleased to find she did a fine job. It was an unexpectedly hard-hitting film for a female to have to direct. There are very few female characters in the story and those that there are get very little screen time. It's a man's film with a woman at the helm and the results are impressive.<br/><br/>Joel and Ethan Coen wrote the screenplay and it shows. It's a very finely written film. The pacing is terrific (the 137 minutes fly by), the dialogue perfect and the tension in almost every scene captured perfectly. Add to that great acting performances by the entire cast and there really isn't a lot to criticise this film for. War films are never going to be to the liking of every viewer, but if you are planning to sit through one anytime soon 'Unbroken' would be fine choice."

","Epic (true) story of survival and endurance.<br/><br/>The true story of Louis Zamperini. A long-distance runner, he represented the US in the 1936 Olympics. In World War 2 he became a bombardier in a B-24 Liberator in the Pacific. One day, however, his plane is forced to crash land in the ocean and he and the pilot spend over 40 days adrift at sea before the Japanese capture them and send them to a Prisoner of War camp. The camp has a particularly sadistic commander and Zamperini comes in for some particularly vicious treatment, putting his perseverance and endurance to the ultimate test...<br/><br/>Very engaging and compelling movie. Yes, it has been done before (in various forms) - Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence, The Railway Man, Paradise Road, Bridge on the River Kwai - but this does not make this movie any less original or unpredictable. Despite its fairly long running time - over 2 1/4 hours - I was engrossed the entire time.<br/><br/>Good special effects and solid direction from Angelina Jolie on her directorial debut.<br/><br/>Good performance from Jack O'Connell in the lead role with solid support from Domnhall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund and Miyavi.<br/><br/>Don't believe all the negative publicity (which seems mostly driven by sexism) - this movie is well worth watching."

","Like most non-Americans I guess, I'd never heard of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini before viewing this bio-pic and it is a truly remarkable story: someone who represented the United States in the 5,000 metres at the 1936 Berlin Olympics and then, during his war service as a bombardier with the USAAF, somehow survived drifting in the Pacific for an amazing 47 days, only to find himself a prisoner of war who was brutalised by his Japanese captors. The prisoner camp scenes in the film are ugly and reminiscent of ""Bridge On The River Kwai"" and ""Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence"".<br/><br/>The director, Angelina Jolie, and the scriptwriters, the Coen brothers, are very well known and treat the material with a respect verging on dullness and as a result this well-made film suffers from a certain lack of characterisation and really weak dialogue. By contrast to director and writers, the actors are virtually unknown: the British star Jack O'Connell as Zamperini, Irish actor Domhnall Gleeson as the other survivor of the time at sea, and Japanese rock musician Takamasa Ishihara (better known by his stage name Miyavi) as the sadistic camp commander Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe, all of whom acquit themselves well.<br/><br/>In some ways, the final moments of the movie are the most poignant. We learn that Zamperini became a born again Christian who forgave his wartime captors, managed to carry the Olympic torch for the Winter Games in Japan (when he was almost 81), and sadly died aged 97 just before ""Unbroken"" was released."

","The non-fiction novel Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption is an incredibly riveting, moving biography of Olympian and prisoner-of-war Louis Zamperini that I believe is an important book to read. Naturally, a movie based on the book was inevitable; the film adaptation does do its subject justice, even if it's only sporadically compelling. Unbroken is a bio-pic about the life of Louie Zamperini in World War II, whose bomber plane was shot down, and he was forced to survive on a raft for 47 days. He was then captured by the Japanese and placed in various camps for over two years, where he was severely abused until he was rescued at the end of the war. There are a lot of great things about Unbroken: the spectacular cinematography, breakout performances from the entire cast, an explosive opening act and some genuinely moving scenes throughout the rest of the film. Angelina Jolie directs the film in a surprisingly graceful way. Despite some obviously unpleasant war scenes present in the film, Unbroken is a beautiful movie to look at. An opportunity that the film misses, however, is the effects of the war on Louie. His battle with alcoholism and PTSD is never mentioned in the film, and although it would have made the movie longer than it already is (137 minutes), there should have been an emphasis on those ideas. Even if it doesn't resonate as strongly as it should, Unbroken is compelling enough to do justice to its subject matter and a must-watch if yo're a fan of World War II movies."

","UNBROKEN Film Review by Adam Gonzalez<br/><br/>Unbroken is the true story about Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, a USA Olympic distance runner who survived in a raft for 47 days after his bomber went down during WWII. He was then caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a series of prisoner of war camps. Produced and directed by Angelina Jolie, this film is based on the non-fiction book by Laura Hillenbrand. Jack O'Connell plays the role of the late Louie ""Louie"" Zamperini (January 26, 1917 – July 2, 2014).<br/><br/>This amazing tale tells the true life events of Louie during his rise as an USA Olympian and his survival of the POW camps. To see the physical and mental abuse that he went through is just astounding. The will to survive is clearly seen in this film. Louie was able to endure being out at sea with barely any food or water then to be caught by the very people he is fighting during the war. Just knowing that he not only survived but thrived from this struggle really shows how someone can turn the most horrific experience into something so positive."

","I was very interested in seeing this film and I have finally seen it and it is an alright film but ends up being disappointing. The premise of this film is set in world war 2 where it shows an Olympian turned war hero attempt to survive a Japanese prisoner of war camp. I am a fan of jack o connell and this is definitely his best ever performance. He really did a good job of making you care about him and really feeling for his character in this predicament that no human being should go through. Domnhall gleeson is his army buddy and he was good in the movie and their relationship was the first relationship I cared about in the film. The villain was pretty good as well and you really don't like in this film which means he is doing his job right. However, there wasn't any other interesting supporting characters in the camp which doesn't help the film. The story of them initially trying to survive on the raft was very interesting as well as his time in the Olympics. However, the film derails when he gets to the camp and the film really slows down and it just doesn't hit the emotional levels that it needs. The script is okay with some of the drama working for the film but some of it just doesn't hit as much as it wants to and it hurts the film. The style of the film looks beautiful and all the cinematography is great and makes you feel with o connell. But as mentioned before the pacing of the film is a bit all over the place and it hurts the structure of the film. Overall this is a decent film but I wanted it to be better."
"mgruebel","7","0","0","11 October 2015"," Competent WW II survival ""true story""
","What do you get when the Coen brothers write the script and Angelina Jolie directs? At a minimum a solidly done film of survival against all odds during WW II. <br/><br/>The plot ranges from floating for months in a raft after an aircraft engine failure, to prisoner of war camps in Japan, and finally within a hair's breath of execution just as US planes fly over, with a happy ""kiss the American soil and meet the family again"" ending.<br/><br/>I can't give it less than 7 because the cinematography is nice, the effects serve the story and not the other way around, the script is solid, and so is the directing and acting by a bunch of newcomers. We can forgive embellishments like nicely trimmed-looking beards after feeding on raw shark for 45 days in a raft - at least the two survivors looked emaciated. To enjoy what this film has to offer, we must also forgive the somewhat routine directing and acting, as well as the competent but not extraordinary score, although this film could have used Howard Shore in Lord-of-the-Rings form to shore up its emotions a bit.<br/><br/>Still, I am much more forgiving when a film under-hams than when it over-hams, and this film treats all its subjects fairly laconically, even the Japanese camp commander with an inferiority complex, and certainly our Olympic runner hero-turned-prisoner of war. It's also a nice touch how major characters come and suddenly go, as tends to be the case in real life where people get separated against their hopes and expectations. It's not surprising that no Oscars were forthcoming, but I think this film will be better liked than most of the overly sappy Hollywood fare in this genre as time goes on, hence my 7/10.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it's definitely worth a rental, and will keep most viewers interested in the characters and story, even though we know in advance how this true story is going to end. I enjoyed it during a 2 hour, 16 minute session on my exercise bike, and it certainly kept me happily pedaling away."

","Unbroken is the incredible true story of Louis Zamperini, directed by Angelina Jolie, from the book by Laura Hillenbrand. If you ever think you are enduring something, watch this movie, and your troubles will feel lighter.<br/><br/>Zamperini was an Italian immigrant who grew up in California. He was not a perfect kid - he stole things, didn't follow the rules. But he learned toughness. He learned he had a special skill - running. He used that to excel in life and build strength.<br/><br/>The video box tells you the whole story. He goes to the Olympics. He goes to war. He goes to a prison camp in Japan. But this guy, he had an inner strength that few of us on the planet have. He was like a superman. My favorite takeaway from that kitche movie Alaska was 'never give up' and boy does that apply here.<br/><br/>Zamperini was brutalized mentally and physically during his imprisonment. But he stood tall. But to be able to endure that on top of his war experience, it's just amazing. He's an amazing person.<br/><br/>Jolie does a fine job of weaving the key plots without hitting you over the head too much. I'm most impressed that the movie was only 2 hrs 18 mins. when less talented directors would have surely made this 3 hrs. Not that there wasn't plenty to tell. But she skillfully used flashbacks at the right times, all woven into a beautiful piece of film work.<br/><br/>I now want to read the book, which apparently details yet more suffering he endured.

Good performance by Jack O'Connell.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw in the movie is the makeup: It's terrible and takes you out of the movie. How persons who spend a month at sea have neat hair and tiny beard that looks like they just went to the barber? Same goes for the POW period, especially with the coal - it looks completely fake (and it seems I'm not the only one thinking that).<br/><br/>Another flaw is that I didn't feel an ""impact"" by this movie. All the elements are there, but somehow it doesn't have a ""punch"". I'm not sure whether it's a problem of writing or direction. Perhaps both.<br/><br/>And one more thing: Many movies I watched during this weekend have the tendency to give long flashbacks, especially the youth period of the person. It's really annoying. I understand a short flashback, but why do they keep doing those long flashbacks? Why don't they tell the story in linear order? So annoying.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me of other POW movies, especially ""Rescue Dawn (2006)"" and ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (1983)"" - and coincidentally both movies feature a pop star in a major role. It also reminded me of ""Memphis Belle"" (and a little of ""Life of Pi"").<br/><br/>Side note: Isn't it a weird choice to cast two English men for major roles as Americans soldiers?<br/><br/>Reading the other reviews, it seems that people really hated this movie.

","Unbroken is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. The films title sums up the movie perfectly, following the story of a real man, a hero, an inspiration, Louis Zamperini had been through a lot over his lifetime, but he never lost his spirit, his courage, his hopes, his aspirations and dreams, this is a very powerful drama that some people, like myself, may find shocking to believe that it is all a true story, it is beautifully directed by Angelina Jolie, and after watching this I'm up for any other films she plans on directing in the future. The only major problem I had with this movie is that it didn't have a lot to offer at an original standpoint, besides the beautiful cinematography and terrific performances, it isn't very unique as a war film, the story is straight forward and it dosen't have any scene that perfectly sums up the characters struggles, this is normally evident in most war films, I just felt like it was a bit too safe and formulaic and because of that I'm giving it an eight instead of the nine it easily could have received. The performances are outstanding and certainly the highlight of the movie, Jack O'Connell's performance is breathtaking, the studio was taking a huge risk with him in the lead role, but thankfully he did a terrific job and was able to hold the whole film on his own and clearly studied his role inside and out, and he is also joined by a terrific supporting cast, such as Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund and Miyavi, there isn't a single performance that isn't inspired and dedicated. It may be very formulaic, but Unbroken makes up for this with top class acting and a powerful true story, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or war film. <br/><br/>An Olympic champion joins the army during Workd War II, only to spend 47 days in a raft and the rest of the war at a prisoner camp in Japan. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Jack O'Connell Worst Performance: Jai Courtney"
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","0","26 September 2015"," There is no success without a strenuous effort
","This film can be entered in two different ways. Through the obvious door at first bu also through the chimney then, and the chimney is always more interesting because it is the way Father Christmas favors.<br/><br/>The first one is the main character and his true story. There is little to say about that true story. Louis Zamperini is what we call a hero. He managed to go through and survive some absolutely unique and insane situations in which he was made to suffer for the pleasure the torturer was getting out of it, that pleasure which compensates for all the frustrations you can imagine. All torturers are simple people in everyday life but they are deeply frustrated or alienated because they could not do what they wanted to do and some others than themselves have been able to do it. They have to take some vengeance and get even with those who dared do better than they did. A sadist is always a failure who is turning his failure into success by getting even with those who were not failures, with those who had the guts to succeed while he, himself, did not have the brain to even imagine how to succeed.<br/><br/>But this approach of the film is not very interesting. No one admire Jesus because he accepted to suffer for us. We admire him because he managed to forgive his torturers.<br/><br/>The second approach is the distance this film creates with WW2. That was an event that was a long time ago and Louis himself is demonstrating that living in the spirit of the war, in the desire to come even with those whom we fought, in some vengeful way or even in some due payment for the suffering they imposed onto us, is absurd and insane.<br/><br/>The film shows that strength is inside and that strength dictates we forgive them afterwards and we try to stand up to them or in fact very often down to them, even if that costs us our own life because dying would be a victory since we would have forced them to sell their soul and their sanity to the devil and to absolute oblivion, human annihilation. It is this strength that enables someone who is unjustly convicted of a crime he did not commit, or of a crime that was never committed, to be strong enough to survive as long as possible and to submit to the final ordeal in dignity. Look at your executioner in the eyes and dare him to be proud of what he is doing in front of God, a committee of one thousand people from all over the world, or simply his mother and father, sister and brother, and let him have the power to tell his own brother he would do the same to him in a similar situation. Why not his father or his mother? <br/><br/>That's where the film is strong. The final image of the room of the sergeant who ran away leaving behind a picture he should have cherished of himself as an infant with his father. He was not in such a hurry that he forgot it. He just let it behind because he couldn't let his father know he would have done the same thing to him if the situation had required it. He knew he was an unworthy son of his own father, that he had betrayed his faith and his hope in him. And that's the worst part of a defeat.<br/><br/>Apart from that level of empathy, the film is beautifully acted and poignantly set up and directed. You cannot resist some scenes because they are stronger than what you way imagine as the maximum you can decently bear. Louis Zamp' carried his beam just as well as Jesus carried his cross. We all have a cross to carry and it is by carrying it we can hope to reach some remarkable level. There is no future to those who want to have it easy all along the way. I can only tell the younger people I know and who seem not to realize that their dream is after a long path of hard efforts and stiff suffering that they are confused: their future is in their hands and that will require them to soil them and to harden them and even to scar them a little. Louis Zamp' shows us that simple truth with the power of an unfailing faith in what strength can bring.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","I want to be as fair as possible in this review and not judge the movie by the book it is based on. Let me start by saying that if you are planning to watch it, then just go watch it and read my review afterwards, that is, if you really want to. I thought the acting was superb and the overall cinematography was well done. I give it 5 stars on both accounts. There was a lot of breath taking scenery. There were however, some noticeable costume/makeup variations in regard to facial hair, starvation, etc, I have to say, it was a bit distracting. The biggest disappointment was the actual story. I also felt that the directing lacked the endearing qualities that draw the viewer into the characters' lives. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT A lot has been said about how the film cuts off the end of the story. Of course there is a tag line at the end which credits Louis' ""faith"" for helping him overcome PTSD. But, from more of a film critic's perspective, the film lacks the solid climactic ending that the audience deserves. Angelina Jolie highlights the suffering and brutality of WW II, the airplane crash, being lost at sea, prison camp, and torture, building up intense emotions, offering all the tension that creates a truly great story with a terrific climax, but it fails to satisfy. Ending with Louis simply coming home, seems to treat his story more like a bio than the great epic story that it really is. They could have done a whole detailed subscript, explaining his ordeal along with his Christian conversion, but that wouldn't have been enough to satisfy the tension that the film brings to bear on its audience. In short, the film lacks heart! It's the difference between watching The History Channel vs. ""It's a Wonderful Life."" END SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly what happened with Jolie and the screen writers here, obviously they read the book and was inspired by the story. I guess they just didn't know quite what to do with the ending. Maybe they didn't want people to think they were religious fanatics. Yes, the movie was already long, but there is still a whole lot to be desired of it. In short, THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER! <br/><br/>One last final word, Unbroken is definitely NOT a movie for children. If you know anything about the story, you should know why. Besides the language and brutality, there is also a scene of two nude prisoners being humiliated as water was thrown on them. There was nothing anti-Christian in the movie, except for the things taken in context (i.e. the brutality of Japanese prison guards)."

"azcoppen","4","3","8","8 January 2015"," Shallow people hopelessly clueless about tough character
","Zamperini's story is one of ridiculously bad luck, and unimaginable suffering. And this film is what happens when possibly the most shallow town anywhere crashes into a wall attempting to portray something it doesn't get at a basic level - the hard, gritty toughness of character itself. It's Hollywood's lame idea of tough; not our grandparents'. One review talks about it feeling more like a Hallmark card, and that's bang on the money. This is a movie about suffering brought to you by people whose general idea of hardship is not being able to get their cappuccino in a timely fashion: they simply have no clue, and are giving it their best guess as to what it might be.<br/><br/>The essence of character is what lies in the destitution of hope; what keeps up defiant in the dace of desolation. Being stranded in this is apparently more like a bad summer bootcamp, with a few beatings thrown in to make it look unpleasant; days on end at sea look like being grounded by your parents, with some sharks; not reading radio propaganda is just an ideological-but-patriotic disagreement; and running a few marathons is what makes you not give up. It's feelgood fluff dressed up as as attempted grit, avoiding all those feelings that aren't very nice and wrongly hoping for an award or thirty. There's apparently no disease in the camps with their civic toilets, your family back home are fine, you get to stay athletic and muscly, you even get a nice scenic view, the abuse is a bit of punching, and after all of it, you get a nice refreshing swim in the river.<br/><br/>The two British leads are, of course, top notch - as always. But even their most vicious stares can't quite save direction that's as harmless as their perfectly-styled hair. The cruelty of the Japanese and the misery of passage was on a level hardly any of us can comprehend (Watanabe, a serious war criminal, confessed to getting a ""sexual thrill"" out of torturing prisoners), where mere survival itself was heroism. Truly depicting it with any degree of realism needs a sense of perpetual exhaustion and powerlessness that seems to never end, with hope being ripped from underneath you time after time - *that* is what is remarkable about Zamperini. What we're left with is the wishful thinking of the writer adapting the book, not the emotional substance of the actual human story. <br/><br/>If you want a better picture of the senseless, genocidal horror these PoWs were thrust into, google for ""Unit 731"", or the ""rape of Nanking"". If you're feeling brave, watch ""Night and Fog"". Any of these will illustrate what a gross insult it is to the Greatest Generation to editorially blunt their stories for the sake of their grandchildrens' emotional ""fragility"".<br/><br/>We know it will eventually end, and we got to eat through it - they didn't. The study is in what keeps a man defiant despite that, and it doesn't take a filmmaker to sense how phoney the Disney version is. It even ends with cutesy uplifting music, as if it was written to be shown to American teens as some cheesy ""don't give up"" motivational video: it's a slowly crushing disappointment, unless you're the shallow type who'll pull out a hankie watching the Pearl Harbor credits.<br/><br/>The fact you don't really care about Zamperini enough is the greatest injustice of all of it - because the script continually and cowardly opts out of the reality of suffering. But the saddest damnation of the whole thing is that it's the audience, not the man, who are left unbroken."

Even though you know the Liberator crew is going to crash, you can't help but feel the sorrow of the loss of the plane and its crew. Shipwrecked at sea in a rubber raft, you relate with the lost crew, are embroiled in their loss and sorrow and frightened when they are attacked by sharks. The POW scenes accurately evoke the pain and hopelessness these men must have felt. Most striking and personal for me, the scene where a prisoner trips and falls to his death, instantly reminded me of my own grandfathers tales of tramping over the dead in a Russian POW camp in WW2, helpless to help. I've heard some reviewers comment that the movie was OK but lacking. I personally found it historically accurate, beautifully shot and directed and emotionally accurate. If you're expecting a happy go lucky concentration camp movie, don't go. Its a hard watch and will bring you to tears."

","First, I did not read the book, so cannot make any comparison. My wife and I were interested in seeing this movie after seeing an interview with Louie on 'CBS Sunday Morning.' We both enjoyed the movie. Obviously the entire book would not fit into the time allotted for a feature film, but we felt this captured the most significant part of Louie's story, his survival when faced with ridiculous odds. Yes, it might have been interesting to see more of his pre-war days and his post-war days, but the film was more about one man's incredible spirit rather than about the man himself.<br/><br/>Some have indicated they thought the movie dragged on, but I never had any sense of how long it was. The action scenes were expertly done and very realistic looking, at least to someone who never experienced similar moments, and I thought the portrayal of the prison camp gave a good sense of the suffering involved.<br/><br/>But the most amazing thing to me, and why Ms. Jolie jumped a peg or two in my eyes, is that I don't recall a single vulgarity in the film, and that's unheard of these days, especially a war film. Don't get me wrong, I've cursed plenty and have no problem with cursing in films, but I do think it gets overused and often has no relevance to either the story or characters. It was very refreshing to watch a film where the director (or perhaps writers) felt similarly."
"Dfilono","5","3","8","2 January 2015"," Not Impressed
","When I first saw the trailers for Unbroken, I had high hopes. It is unfortunate that these hopes were dashed within the starting minutes of the film. While the plot, and acting, is very strong, the rest fell flat. The actors stand out in their roles, making them their own, and the plot felt intense yet inspirational. This should make a great movie about survival, but it doesn't. Everything was there for this movie, it should have been great. The problem with the film is poor direction, poor effects, and, well to put it simply, lack of character development. While the acting was great, it couldn't make me care at all about the characters. I watched knowing the names of almost none of the supporting characters, including that of the family of the main character, and it made me lose interest. Even the main character's development is rushed, and by the end of the movie I didn't care if he lived or died (fully being aware he lives by the way). While the film does attempt to honor the late Louie Zamperini, it simply doesn't convey his story well at all. The movie feels rushed, never allows the audience to care about the characters, is cliché in almost every way, and even relies on a jump scare to keep the audience interested. The film itself should be able to maintain my interest without the use of cheap tricks such as that. If the movie was poorly acted, it would be garbage, but the acting does take it up a notch, but still can't carry this movie to greatness."
"edwardscissorhands12-874-850830","5","3","8","2 January 2015"," Inconsistent Movie
","Unbroken is a movie that is very inconsistent. First off, the first twenty-thirty minutes of the movie includes flashbacks of the main character to his old life and his Olympic days. However, at a certain point, these flashbacks are abruptly taken from the movie, and no development of the past story is made. There is not even a scene in which the main character decides to join the military... he is running a race, then all of a sudden he is just in the plane in the war. This is a very fragmented story structure that remains inconsistent with continuity errors such as these throughout the movie. The acting is nothing special, but if I had to say the best performance was by the main character's army mate who was captured with him. The leader of the prison camp gave one of the worst performances of the year, and I often found myself laughing at his facial expressions. The soundtrack is the one thing in the movie that I can actually say had the power to blow me away. The movie would be much lesser if it did not have such a suitable score.<br/><br/>The thing about this movie that I have been trying to say is that it is not awful and it is not perfect. It is just so inconsistent in every sense of the word that eventually it is just nothing special and pretty forgettable. This film could have been much shorter if it did not show the same exact scene of characters being beaten to a pulp for half of the movie. As I said, there is little room for development, which makes us not really care for the characters and makes it hard for us to feel what Jolie wanted us to feel towards certain topics. For example, when we are supposed to almost sympathize with the Japanese near the end, I felt no reason to do so because nothing in the movie made me want to; it was just shoehorned in to add something to make the movie longer.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say this movie was entertaining, but it is by no means perfect. I would say you can wait for it to be on Netflix to watch. GRADE: C+"
"sweg141676","5","3","8","30 December 2014"," Could have been better, but still watchable.
","For her first try as a director, Angelina Jolie choose a topic that could not fail. An American Hero overcoming insurmountable obstacles. With the Coen brothers writing it, whats not to love? There are a few major problems with the film. There is no character development, the pacing of the film keeps your attention at some points and puts you to sleep in others. Unfortunately, I could not get emotionally attached to any of the main characters, I wanted to empathize with them in their trials, but I just could not. <br/><br/>Now all of that being said, there was some good that came out of it, The dog fights were awesome, and the sets were beautiful. Would this movie have been better in the hands of an experienced director? Yes it probably would, but that is true for most first time directors. Was this a bad movie? No, It had its moments.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this: The type of film that it is will get different responses, if you were thinking about seeing the movie, go see it, it may affect you differently than it did for me."

","As most people probably know or have heard Unbroken is the true story of Louis Zamperini, the son of poor Italian Americans who grew up as a delinquent, was steered into competitive track and field, became an Olympic athlete, and whose life changed direction with the beginning of World War II (as it did to so many during the time). He joined the United States military, fought heroically for his country, survived being stranded on the ocean after a crash landing and then in a Japanese Prisoner of War Camp till the end of WWII.<br/><br/>The life of Louis Zamperini is incredible, but the movie failed to capture the whole story on so many levels. The main focus of the movie seemed to be on his suffering in PG-13 form. (I don't think that movies need to have excessive violence or filth, but what he actually when through was much more graphic and awful than the movie portrayed it to be.) It was very reminiscent of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ where all that was shown was the death of Jesus of Nazareth while his life was skipped over which is what made his death an important event. But even through Zamperini's suffering in the Japanese POW Camp for instance, it didn't at all show the comradery, brotherhood, or the love and friendship the prisoners had in their time of captivity. Was it a story of survival? Yes, but what was he surviving for? There is a distinct difference between surviving something and living through it. Louis Zamperini lived not survived. He lived his life to the fullest. <br/><br/>While Angelina Jolie will probably get most of the blame if this movie doesn't do well, I think what lacked the most was not direction, but was the writing. The book Unbroken (written by Laura Hillenbrand) was excellent. It was historically accurate, rich in detail and background information, but also gave the heartfelt story straight from the mouth of the real man himself. The writers of this movie had the best material to start from yet I think they only got a glimpse of Zamperini's life story. The very end gives a brief look of what his life became after the events that occurred in the film, but I think this should have been a major part of the plot. <br/><br/>Having read the book before-hand, my view of the movie is slightly skewed compared to those who have not, but here is my rating:<br/><br/>The book: 10/10<br/><br/>The movie in and of itself: 6.5/10<br/><br/>The movie compared to the book: 3/10"

"FilmMuscle","6","3","9","26 December 2014"," Exactly What You'd Expect From Angelina Jolie
","There are some filmmakers/storytellers that carry a very cynical and cold vision when depicting people and their stories—filmmakers that are reluctant to get too close to their subjects so that a cornucopia of biased tenderness doesn't consume them and birth a fully reverential (blandly extoling) tale about this particular subject. Angelina Jolie happens to have a different agenda, on the opposite end of this spectrum, and considering we know quite a bit about her after all these years already, the most accurate adjective I can give to her second directorial entry: ""unsurprising."" Jolie has a very warm, sentimental, and hopeful attitude about her. In this case, I can't confidently criticize her for overreaching on the sentimentality scale; the fact of the matter is that it gets tricky when one readies himself to review a true story. I, myself, can't take that away from the film or Louis Zamperini who is an incredible human being that survived an unbelievably incredible life—from an impeccable runner representing the US in the Olympics to a soldier who's stranded out in the middle of the ocean to a helpless prisoner in a ruthless Japanese internment camp. <br/><br/>This all sounds very well like an ""Oscar-bait"" kind of Hollywood motion picture, but again, it actually happens to be an insane true story. However, just because it's true and oh-so-inspiring, it doesn't mean that I can be easily swayed into absolutely admiring it. You can call me cold-hearted or you can just call me objective and hesitant. Admittedly, I don't have the ability to question the exact accuracy of all the miniscule heroic, unrelenting details of Zamperini's journey presented here, but I definitely can scrutinize the quality and appropriateness of its translation to the big screen. After this year's earlier blockbuster, Maleficent, which shamelessly transformed one of Disney's most horrifying villains into a sympathetic, compassionate caretaker, and now this total motivator, I have doubts that Jolie can commit to something that's (much) morally grayer in her artistic pursuits. This film tonally deceives you; while it presents us with truly disturbing scenes of torture and endless suffering (that almost becomes tedious in its uneventful repetition), Unbroken nonetheless sweeps you up from under your feet and tries to fill your heart with that final, last-minute dose of forceful effusiveness. <br/><br/>What compelled me to keep my eyes on the screen throughout honestly wasn't the grandeur of the story but Jack O'Connell's magnificently transformative performance as Louis—a performance that exhibits despair, satisfying confidence, mania, optimism, and sometimes even near-defeat. Obviously not on equal ground with the sheer courageous strength of the man he's portraying, O'Connell still possesses his own strong-rooted (thespian) commitment that sees him losing a frightening amount of weight to bare bones less than mid-way into the narrative. The primary villain, Mutsuhiro Watanabe (aka ""The Bird""), is played very eccentrically by Japanese musician Miyavi. Watanabe is the central prison guard with an interestingly feminine appearance along with that deceptive soft voice of his. <br/><br/>Of course, you can't deny the utterly monumental nature of this story and its structure as you're taken from one tremendously perilous and insurmountable predicament to another, from famished sharks to the desperate-to-win Japanese. The haplessness never ceases and only worsens. But ""a moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory,"" so it seems and only proves to be true once everything is said and done and a legacy has been made out of Zamperini's adventurous lifetime. Some of the scenes here are almost too excessive in their long-winded suffering, seeming to drag on for too long, but it seems to be in the strength of the director to keep the pace and interest afloat. For instance, a scene that shows a group of people filing in a line to punch Louis real hard in the face for his misbehavior might seem like it'd eventually reach monotony, but the scene is edited and shot with impressive diversity (one shot focuses on Louis' failing posture and another on The Bird's fascinating expressions, and so on) to effectively maintain that drama. Another sequence, probably the best of the overall movie, sees an aerial battle as American soldiers, along with Louis, fend off fierce Japanese planes; it's all executed with a staying sense of tension and intrigue despite the occasional slowing of the pace. <br/><br/>Now, on the other hand, the weakest link of the movie is surely its screenplay, which is unexpectedly disappointing considering that it was written by the Coen Brothers who, by the way, aren't really known for their affectionate writing—so, a very odd and unrecognizable choice there. Unbroken is littered with saccharine, fortune-cookie inspirational lines (""if you can take it, you can make it,"" guys!) and unrealistic dialogue. If you can make an inspiring movie that feels more natural and convincing than simply emotionally manipulative, or frankly emotionally/psychologically simplistic, then you have some undeniable talent. This film, however, plays it very safe and formulaically; this tale is about forgiveness, religion, idealism— hardly something that sounds like it could be a little more subtle and restrained."

He was a troubled youth who was coached by his older brother to compete in long-distance running. He was a part of the American Olympic team which competed in Germany in 1936. Later, he was part of a bomber squadron in World War II when his plane was lost at sea. Near death, he was spared that death by being captured by the Japanese. He was a prisoner of war until the Japanese surrendered. <br/><br/>These events are told well. The film is beautiful to see and interesting viewing."

","My opinion and description of this movie directed by Angelina Jolie was an amazing inspirational movie with a lot of heart and hardship and the portraying of breaking down the body but also the soul and watching the greater good win. The selection of actors were a perfect representation and they did an amazing job at portraying the feelings of the surrounding situations. Examples are the heart and determination of Louie and the non-stop antagonizing thirst for power from the ""Bird"". Also the flow or way the movie was betrayed was amazing and the transition between the present and the past was flawless. Now onto the music was amazing and really gave feeling to the movie and place and the mood of the prisoners. The place was very believable to what a work camp would look like back then. Some positives and negatives are that it can leave you kind of sad and depressed but also in the end it can make you happy because the inspiration.

","Once again when I read the reviews on IMDb I come to the conclusion that there are a lot of pathetic wannabe movie directors on here. How the hell can you rate this movie with 4 stars or lesser is beyond my comprehension especially when you see the amount of garbage movies that are rated better. I don't know what's wrong with those people, must be frustration or something like that. And you can't come with that idiotic argument again that the book is better then the movie because that's the case for 99% of the books. If you like the books better then just read it and don't watch the movie. I watch a movie to be entertained and the least you can say about Unbroken is that you are entertained. I thought Angelina Jolie and the Coen brothers did a brilliant job with Unbroken. I liked ""Against the Sun"" which is almost the same movie like the beginning of Unbroken, but Unbroken is even better with the constant battle and humiliation between Zamperini and Watanabe at the end. Both Jack O'Connell and Takamasa Ishihara gave us an excellent performance with their roles. Throughout the whole movie you can only feel sorry for those prisoners and you only hope that Watanabe is going to get what he deserves. Brilliant acting! I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I wonder which movie all those negative reviewers would give a top rating? I can only suggest to all those haters to stop whining all the time and to get a life."

","There is one point in this movie where its figure, Louis Zamperini, is about to give up and decided to surrender himself to God in a middle of a harsh storm. Unbroken claims in the end that this is a journey of discovering true faith, but after that crucial scene, the movie almost forgot (or mostly implied) about that thematic potential until it reprises at the epilogue. Over-sentimentalizing this subject is definitely not everyone's favorite choice, but it is one interesting side that seems important to explore more, especially for acknowledging the person's prime motivation. As a biopic, the movie goes to a typical prestigious mode where it's enough to showcase the nobility of the man, but it skillfully realizes his struggle during war, which alone made it absorbing. Although biographies cut out to be better than this type of standard, it still manages to be compelling.<br/><br/>Before all of the unpleasant parts happen, the film kinda rushed Zamperini's days of growing up. He was once a young rebellious kid who was suddenly changed by a new career. This certain flashback seem to been used only as a basic information of where he came from. There wasn't much of a development within those memories. It's intriguing to know more of Louis' relationship with his brother other than his support with his sprinting talent. His issues with his parents is also easily resolved by this case. But that is understandable, though also less engaging, which deserves to be told better. It's better when he is among the lost survivors, interacting to the people he is stuck with. Even though these characters aren't well developed, the script finds ways to make each of their moments worth settling into.<br/><br/>The best of the film is when they are suffering. The direction lingers the worst of their experience. It's not the easiest thing to watch, but these are the parts where the movie becomes real effective, and that is thankfully what most of the film is. A stronger sequence is when they are stranded in an ocean, not knowing what exact threat is about to come, while dealing with thirst and starvation. There's also a good speculation of them losing out control if they are isolated in a place by themselves.<br/><br/>The next step of the struggle is a survival from slavery in Japanese Navy prison camp. This leads the ordeal into a hate relationship with an abusive prison guard. This segment is interestingly put together, if only the antagonist was played by a much intimidating actor. Though, the Japanese characters are basically depicted as one-noted enemies that doesn't do beyond than torturing their prisoners and making them dishonor their country. But really, this is supposed to be a realm of pain. The acting is pleasantly less showy than a usual prestige drama would ask: Jack O'Connell convincingly shows what this man has been through, with modesty, which is easy enough to join along his survival's cruelty.<br/><br/>Unbroken is pretty hard to deal with whether it's supposed to be good or not. At its best, it's actually a compelling survival film; supported by a slick direction and exquisite cinematography. At its worst; it's a character study that lacks the rest of its important human elements. Sure, the pain is easily felt on screen, but the resilience remains to be a conventional picture of inspiration. We can believe a person who can roll with these punches, but we also found out that he is a man who will only leave this struggle with true honor. And the movie doesn't get the chance to get around with that, or at least show a point where his spirit has gone too fragile to keep moving forward. That would have been much powerful. But Unbroken works best as an epic, it may not be as impacting as tries to be, but it sure is one grand experience."
"thomas-w15","5","2","5","21 January 2015"," Hoping for a lot more...
","Unbroken: I could not have higher hopes coming into this film. After seeing one of the most inspiring trailers I have have ever seen, I was expecting one of the most inspiring movies I have ever seen. Sadly, the film came up short. Some moments are inspirational, but a lot of the times the film just stayed on the surface- played it safe. It never really got to the level I was hoping to see. Yes, I know there is no more inspiring real-life story in the world than this one, but that is not the movie, that is what the real Louis Zamperini did. The movie cannot take credit for it. Unbroken is a film that will leave most satisfied enough but with poor directing and screen writing, this film is not a worthy enough picture to be made about the life of Louis Zamperini.<br/><br/>When I asked most people what they love about the movie, most just say ""Oh, I thought it was really good, I loved the story."" The story is what makes the movie appealing but that is just what the movie is based upon. Its like saying ""I loved the movie because I loved the book."" If they actually thought about it strictly as a film, they will realize that the movie is not half as good as they have it in their mind. Why do I say this? Mainly because in the moments when the audience is suppose to get that feeling of courage and perseverance, I did not. I did not feel inspired. The first time director, Angelina Jolie, did not fully capture the moment in the film and I kind of fell like she just hoped we would feel inspired because of the story and of some patriotic duty. To make it worse she added in these stupid Hollywood scenes that never even really happened. Why would a the head of a prisoner of war camp ask you to hold a really big piece of wood and if you drop it you die? They don't. That never really happened. Yes, there is a special spot in hell reserved for that man known as ""The Bird"", but even he would say it would just seem moronic to do that. It was just a cheap trick that the director tried to use in hopes of making the movie stand out amongst other war films.<br/><br/>Alright, alright, enough of that stuff. I still did enjoy a few things about Unbroken. The main being the acting. Jack O'Connell, who plays Louis Zamperini, was the only one in the film throughout the whole thing, and he did a great job at what he had laid out in front of him. I believe he was a little misacted because he looks a little to Irish to play an Italian guy but that is not his fault. What he did with the role was very impressive. If directed better, his performance would have gotten more notice, but still I believe O'Connell shows much promise with this role and I think he might hit it big if he gets the right director. The rest of the cast all did well with the screen time they were given. <br/><br/>Another thing I liked was the parts of the movie that focused on Louis Zamperini's youth. The flashback scenes of him as a kid and during high school were the scenes I feel were directed the best. They really conveyed his early upbringing well with the short amount of time they had to do it. If that kind of directing was continuous throughout the film, it would have been much better. I also liked the relationship between Zamperini and his fellow soldiers. In war, a relationship with your fellow soldiers is what keeps you alive and it is the main reason why you keep fighting. If they added in a few more scenes with this is mind, it would have served the film well. <br/><br/>As you may know, this film takes place largely in a prisoner of war camp and has numerous scenes where the main character is getting tortured. As such, it is definitely not suitable for children and anyone who can't handle that kind of stuff. I recommend you see this film in theaters or on DVD, but you will probably enjoy watching it more at home.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

"mannacio","5","2","5","3 January 2015"," Unbalanced Vision with Questionable cross cutting
","First, while we all must stand in admiration of the extraordinary courage and perseverance of Louis Zamperini, the extent of the portrayal of torture in this film far exceeds what would be required to comprehend his experience. In some respects torture is like sex: if there is too much of it we have pornography. In that respect, though I am hardly a prude, one must wonder how this film ever got a PG-13 rating. For an adolescent moviegoer this movie could be overwhelming and a source of nightmares.<br/><br/>Second, the way the cross cutting is handled - with extensive use of flashbacks - the narrative sometimes suffers from what one might call ""bottom spin"". That would be the reverse of ""top spin"" where (just before a short TV commercial, for example) you are held in suspense for a brief period then brought back to the main action. Here, the suspense that might have been present is demolished by rather long flashback sequences.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the acting, on the other hand, are commendable, which is the only reason I can give this movie as much as a 5/10. For movies in this genre the Railwayman is far better."

","After reading the wonderful telling of the full story by Laura Hillenbrand, watching this movie was a joy to see on screen many moments of Zamp's life. But without the book, the film is missing the best part of Louie's conquest. The full story of Zamperini is so bright. But the film, covering so many events wonderfully, told only the first half; the tough as nails set-up. As he said in an interview when reading certain parts of the book, Zamperini felt like he was back in war. Just this portion of his journey is rough to witness. The film has many scenes that show his amazing life, with artistic editing and set design. Reading reviews of the film I was prepared to not get the full re-telling of story in the theater. But after reading the book first it was epic just to see a cinematic retelling of the incredible challenges he overcame. After the film I really wanted to clap! Just didn't want to be the only one. Excellent - WITH the book!"

","Some of the following could be considered a spoiler. After reading the book and being impacted greatly by the story of Louis Zamporini, I have NO idea what it would be like to watch this movie without knowing anything about Zamporini. I'd love to read a review from that perspective. I believe this story deserves to be a mini-series at some point. I wouldn't start with the flight as the book does. I would start with Zamporini as a troubled youth. I agree with others that a narrator would have helped a great deal. In fact, I would base the series on Hillenbrand working with Zamporini to put the book together. I believe the time and effort to get the story into book form is as much a story as Zamporini himself. The book has 50 pages of bibliography references. It's a historical masterpiece. I guess I was expecting and hoping the movie would suck me in like Castaway did many years ago. However, with all that in mind, the movie deserves a high rating in my opinion. I saw key components of the long, detailed book in less than 140 minutes on screen. If you loved the book and didn't like the movie, fine. If you saw the movie and wonder what the big deal is, then take the time to read the book. It's a story that should have been mandatory reading in history classes in America. I can't help but think it was purposely left out of the classroom for political reasons. This book is truth and the Truth will set you free."

","The sound of an air raid and guns going off are the last things WWII survivors want to remember, yet they like to talk about them. I've recanted about post traumatic stress in the military, yet I've recently heard about curing the nightmares by talking about it. Not just in a therapeutic way but also to walk the footsteps they've already taken, therefore retracing their thoughts to see what they learned out of it. It may be simply don't go to war, but it could also be to never give up hope. Becoming a military storyteller just may be what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/>I can vouch for my own grandfather who is ninety-four, yet seems to be in good spirits and health. He served as a medic during WWII, a doctor during the Korean War and Vietnam, and was a hospital administrator until sometime in the eighties when he retired. He always likes to talk about his days in the Navy and they are some fantastic tales of courage. Cinema has seen many stories of ones heroic experience during wartime. Last year, we had Lone Survivor during the war on terror. Now we have a WWII story in Unbroken. <br/><br/>Louie Zamperini begins as an Italian immigrant who is still a young boy when his family settled in Torrance, California. He's a troublemaker and constantly bullied for being an immigrant, but his brother Peter notices how fast he is. With a new pair of shoes, Louie become a respected runner, even gaining the name ""the Torrance Tornado"", going as far as the 1936 Olympics in Berlin where he places 8th. WWII comes next where Louie immediately joins, looking to serve his country and maybe make it to the next Summer Games.<br/><br/>He becomes a bombardier in the Air Force in the South Pacific where he's found a crowd of people he can call his friends. Their called on a search mission in an unstable plane, which the military insists is air-worthy. Both engines fail, crashing into the sea. Three make it out; Zamperini, Mac and Phil. They survive on a raft where they ration the little food they have and attempt to ward the sharks that are swimming around them. They manage to go on living for another forty-seven days (though they lose Mac) when they're finally foundby the Japanese military. Their captured and sent to a P.O.W. camp where Zamperini endures the meanest military officer around, Mutsuhiro ""Bird"" Watanabe, who feels nothing but jealousy for the Olympic athlete.<br/><br/>This ""military grunt who goes through the storm to triumph"" seems like something that has been done beforeand I'm not gonna lie when I feel like that it's familiar to me too. But that didn't ruin my experience watching this as Zamperini is a very likable guy here, always showing the will to survive even when the Japanese tell him that he's nothing. Jack O'Connell plays our lead and does really well with this guy, giving him the needed rebellious edge to give him his strength for his darkest moments. <br/><br/>Angelina Jolie is behind the camera here as the film looks really well. Much of the news behind Unbroken is her directing this movie. While it's not as groundbreaking as Stanley Kubrick or Oliver Stone, she can paint an impressive side of the war. The movie itself is something that I'm glad I watched, but I don't know if I'd watch it again. It's not the story, but it's just kind of sandwiched between a lot of other war movies. I would understand why people would love this and even understand why it could become a box office hit,<br/><br/>I'll give this seven B-24 Liberator planes out of ten. Unbroken manages to pass as something that's interesting to hear about, though once you hear about the hundreds of military triumph stories, it'll be easy to lose track."
"agblum","8","3","10","28 December 2014"," A Very Good Tribute to a True American Hero!
","""Unbroken"" is the true story USA Olympian and World War II Prisoner of War Survivor Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, portrayed wonderfully in the movie by Jack O'Connell, based on the 2010 non-fiction book by Laura Hillenbrand ""Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption."" The film also marks the Directorial Debut for Academy Award Winning Actress, and Humanitarian Angelina Jolie. The movie traces the story of Zamperini being bullied in childhood, as a child of Italian immigrants, to his rise as a Track Star in High School, leading to him becoming an Olympian, to his service in the US Air Force in World War II, where he was eventually captured by the Japanese, and was imprisoned in different prisoner of war camps. Zamperini must overcame horrible torture and abuse by his captors to survive until war's end. The movie has been receiving mixed reviews. While I won't say it is a 4-Star Masterpiece, and I could think of what one or two things that could have made it more effective - but I liked it very much. I think the movie is a Very Good Tribute to a True American Hero. Certainly applause should go to all involved with the film for putting Zamperini's story on screen. Considering the subject matter, and the fact that it is her first time Directing, I believe Jolie deserves some praise. I am not saying she deserves a Best Directing Oscar, or the Film deserves a Best Picture Oscar, but I can say this – I was moved at film's end. 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars – 8 ½ out of 10."
"jdkraus","7","3","11","30 December 2014"," Everything looks great but it is still missing something
","""Unbroken"" is the story of Louis Zamperini. The events of his life are beyond unbelievable and present the vision of a great bio-picture. Growing up in the poor slums of New York as an Italian-American, Louis participated in the 5,000 meter race at the 1936 Munich Olympic Games, fought as a bombardier in World War II, crashed landed in the Pacific Ocean only to be captured by the Japanese navy, where he spent two years as POW under the ruthless supervision of a Corporal Watanabe. There are so many fascinating components of his life that no wonder Angelina Jolie chose to shoot a film about him. The under dog story of his success, his defiance against both death and the brutality of the Japanese are the makings of an Oscar bait bio-pic. <br/><br/>What I really liked about ""Unbroken"" is how Jolie depicts Louis with the dignity and respect of a newly found iconic figure and war veteran. There are times where he seems to be displayed as almost a perfect, god-like individual. He is but a man, yet the movie makes him more than that. Great legends and stories are often molded from such feats of humanity. Jolie has also surrounded herself with some of the best geniuses in the business. The Coen Brothers wrote the script. Roger Deakins captured the cinematography. Alexandre Desplat composed the musical score. Nothing could potentially weight this movie down with such a great team. <br/><br/>While technically sound and backed with an intriguing character, ""Unbroken"" fails to engage me on an emotional level. Never do I really feel like applauding or rooting for the hero. I never feel like crying over his hardships or his loss of friends from the war. There is no 'oomph,' nor is there really any soul in the film. It is almost as if simply because we see Louis achieve greatness we are supposed to feel empathy for his character. Though I applaud the real man for how he had triumphed, I cannot do the same with Jack O'Connel in the pivotal role. His acting is quite flat and uninspiring. The other characters feel more like caricatures of the time versus actual people. There's the evil Japanese corporal who has it out for Louis. There is the friend who is weaker in will that relies on Louis to survive. There's the older brother who helped guide his life. There is his dad who wants to keep the family united. There is the mother who does nothing but cry when she is on camera. Get the picture? All one-dimensional personalities. <br/><br/>The story structure does not help much either. The bulk of the plot centers on Louis's World War II experience, with intermittent flashbacks of his childhood and career as an athlete. Any one part of his life can be turned into a solid feature. Cramming it all in together is okay, but it suppresses other details of his life. In fact, the film ends abruptly as he returns home from WWII. His journey back home is just as important as the other parts of his life. Then again, only so much can be covered in a feature film. When it exceeds the 2.5 hour mark, it gets dull. Fortunately, ""Unbroken"" is not a boring movie by any means. It just takes certain parts of his life precedent over other ones. <br/><br/>I am sad that Louis Zamperini did not live to see the final product. I am sure he would have felt some catharsis and personal self-reflection if he had viewed this film. ""Unbroken"" is not a bad effort by Jolie and her team. It's just not the masterpiece that it could have been."

The movie represented simply a telling of events that occurred in this man's life. Perhaps the pressure was great to fit it all in but left a ""matter of fact"" feeling of the telling. Despite the movie's shortcomings the acting was solid and photography beautifully done. Overall the true life story of Louie is so inspirational that at the end of the movie the theatre erupted in applause which spoke more to the life lived than the quality of the movie."

It's the type of movie that is dramatically grim so it can hit you hard with the silver lining. It felt very Hollywood the way it just pulled the right strings.<br/><br/>With Jolie at the helm, the movie got the advantage of being a great looking War picture.<br/><br/>It's an uplifting story of a boy who thought he was nothing but with the support of his family becomes something as an Olympic runner, and with this support and feeling that he was something he was able to survive captivity in a Japanese POW camp during World War 2.<br/><br/>It was shot well and I commend Jolie for picking good actors and not superstars, but I must admit that she's one of those people like George Clooney, who Hollywood has put on such a high pedestal, that I went into the movie expecting more than I got."
"phxphil","4","2","6","6 February 2015"," Slow and Bad Script
","Unbroken was just okay. I gave it one star lower than mid-range because I fell asleep for a portion and have no desire to see any part of it again to catch up. The film is about a WWII soldier held prisoner by the Japanese and was based on a very long book who many say was excellent. I read that Jolie successfully convinced the studio to let her bring the picture to the screen by selling them on how she capture the heart of the story. She failed. The script spent waaaay too much of the film depicting the character's suffering while floating around the ocean in a raft after their plane crashed. It seemed to take up the entire first half of the film. That time would have been better spent telling the story of how the main character dealt with his trauma after the war. The credits at the end refer to it. Apparently he struggled but finally found some solace through his faith and traveled to Japan to meet his captors who he forgave. Now I'd rather have seen some of that story than watching three men barfing after they tried to eat a seagull."
"Sanpaco13","4","2","6","19 January 2015"," Angelina Jolie must be incredibly immature spiritually
","I don't get why you would make a movie about such an amazing individual and have the entire focus be on the pain and suffering he had to endure and then throw a two minute thing at the end with a few paragraphs about how he ""made peace"". I don't know about you but that's the most important part of the story for me. OK so he survived physically, but how did he finally overcome spiritually and mentally? Very disappointed we didn't get any of that in this movie. I only hope the book has more to offer than this movie did. The best part of the movie was seeing Louis at the end as an 80 year running in Tokyo. We missed his entire journey getting to a point of forgiveness and being able to do that."

","So I open up the TA review page for this movie, and almost every review on the first page is really negative... what the heck? If you click through to the scores, you'll see that most people are rating this movie quite highly. Why does IMDb give it 7.2 at the time of writing and why are all these negative reviews being upvoted to the first page? Something strange going on there.<br/><br/>This is a good movie, worth at least about 8/10. It tells the story of a man in extremis (lost at sea and then imprisoned in a brutal Japanese POW camp). All the themes of that genre are explored here. Sh*t happens; sometimes horrible sh*t. Do you accept what life has thrown you or do you heroically battle on? The main thrust of the movie is: will he survive? <br/><br/>But it is also the true story of Louis Zampirelli, apparently a remarkable man, and it is told quite realistically and in harrowing detail. In essence: Louis was an Olympic athlete who became a fighter bombardier in the USAF during WWII. He was lost at sea for almost two months, only to be rescued by the Japanese, who treated their POWS brutally. <br/><br/>Finally, it is the story of a specific war and the reality of Japanese camps. We have lost track over the last generation about the cruelty committed in that theatre, so this is a timely reminder. Some of these men are still alive. I saw the fanaticism of Watanabe as having echoes in today's news. It had me thinking that maybe Jolie was trying to send a message to the US: we have dealt with fanaticism before and won.<br/><br/>I was deeply moved at times.<br/><br/>To me, the movie had an unexpected elegiac, iconic or epic feel to it. I suppose that's to be expected. I noticed the same in Fury (perhaps not accidentally starring Jolie's husband, Brad Pitt). The people who lived through that war are not making movies anymore so we don't see it through their eyes here. The new generation seems to want to show the grim reality of the war but also the heroism of the ""Greatest Generation"". We are on the edge of losing all the people who fought in that war. It's as if we need to acknowledge their greatness.<br/><br/>Somehow the result comes across as a little artificial to me. We cannot reproduce the earnestness and cinematic style of the 1940s and 1950s. And frankly: isn't heroism dead? ""If you can take, you will make it."" Does that resonate at all with the internet generation?<br/><br/>One aspect of the movie that bothered me a little: the men who went to that war did not all look like muscular young models. We apparently can no longer find young male actors with ordinary bodies."

Times have changed. The film goes back to 1940, shows how to be strong, but the men's characters are like now, delicate and feminine. (Somewhere seen the manicure of Japanese commander, so carefully done as if female).<br/><br/>3) While the film wants to show the strength of character, doesn't lack feminine behavior: In the new camp, the protagonist when he sees that the commander is the same sadistic Japanese almost faints.

","What I really liked about the movie was that this was the first American movie ever to show a glimpse of how truly cruel the Japanese were during WWII. Not to hatch the past or to hold a grudge, but it is important to know the accurate history. I applaud the producers for making this movie. Yet, this seemingly wonderful and moving story of perseverance and triumph did not come through clearly through the somewhat spotty story-telling and raw acting jobs. The characters did not fully develop, and obviously some important portions of the story were left out. Finally, the ending was...what should I say...very uninteresting and flat.

"tabuno","8","1","2","15 January 2019"," Being Something Through Competition and Survival
","3 January 2015. There is likely a balance to be struck between reality of a relatively famous person's life and the dramatization of it onto the big screen. Assuredly there might be even more amazing life stories out there and there might be even more captivating ways to selectively develop movie appeal. Yet as a director and executive producer, Angelina Jolie, has produced a film that appears to encompass a balance between real and interest in this movie. The audience is introduced to brief scenes of a young boy who doesn't believe in himself as an Italian in America outcast, to a big brother prodded athletic competitor, to a fearsome World War II experience over the skies of Japan, to lost at sea, and then prisoner of war.<br/><br/>This movie fuses a sports and war theme into a biographical display of endurance and survival. Unbroken brings the intensity of competition as displayed by Francis Osmet's 1913 U.S. Golf Open in The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005), the physical and mental torture of Michael Caine in the espionage classic and BAFTA Best Film The Ipcress Files (1965), the struggle of survival of The Life of Pi (2012), Mel Gibson's Golden Globe Best Foreign Picture nominee Apocalypto (2006) or Steven Spielberg's Best Oscar picture Schindler's List (1993). The difficulty faced by Jolie was sustaining the momentum and power of the movie with the different pacing elements without an action-thriller-adventure theme. Instead Jolie faced the difficulty of a biographical sports, sustained survival theme like that faced by Tom Hanks' Golden Globe winner in Cast Away (2000). With what Jolie faced, Unbroken appears almost unscathed in its ability to bring forth this true life, heroic story."

"mattrossitch","9","1","2","13 November 2018"," Can Faith Keep You From Breaking?
","The 2014 film, Unbroken, is the true story of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, who survived 47 days at sea and two years in Japanese prisoner of war camps during World War II. Directed by Angelina Jolie, Unbroken is based on the 2010 book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand. Jack O'Connell plays the role of Louie Zamperini, and Domhnall Gleeson and Miyavi join him in the supporting roles of Phil and Watanabe. The title appropriately describes Zamperini's spirit and body despite the harsh conditions and abuse he endures during his life. Unbroken powerfully portrays the amazing life of Louie Zamperini and shows how belief in yourself and strong faith can help people survive the harshest of life's circumstances.<br/><br/>Louie grew up as a troubled Italian immigrant. Thanks to his brother, Pete, he turned to running to stay out of trouble and release his frustrations, and he was chosen to be an Olympic runner for the United States of America. In the 1934 Olympics, Louie set a last lap record of 56 seconds, and the experience left him looking forward to the next opportunity in Tokyo. These Olympics were not in his future, and instead, Louie was commissioned by the military as a Lieutenant. During a rescue mission, his plane crashed and only three survived. Louie survived on a raft for 47 days and is eventually found by a Japanese Warship. The Japanese take Louie and his one surviving companion, Phil, to a Japanese prison camp where Louie is personally tortured by, ""The Bird."" Louie is extremely tough throughout his journey and uses other people's faith and belief to build him up.<br/><br/>The movie is the life story of Louie, so much is portrayed from his perspective. Though the movie is very plot-driven, the theme of ""if you can take it you can make it"" is a prime focus. Pete, Louie's older brother, coined this quote to encourage Louie to make it despite the adversities he faced. Louie is always experiencing troubles, and yet he is always able to channel enough strength to power through. There were many times in which Louie could have easily died, but he carried on and survived. Louie thrives on the faith of others and their belief in him to continue. At the beginning of the film, Louie's mother is praying that her family will be helped and that her son Louie would begin to behave. He also admires his fellow soldier, Phil's faith. Louie uses the encouragement of his brother and others to first make the track team and later survive the abuses of war. Another example of his perseverance is when Louie is running in the Olympics, and he begins to fall behind. He then hears his brother Pete in his head saying, ""Come on Louie"" and he runs the Olympic record for the final lap of his race. Louie was also part of a bombing in which Phil, the pilot, was praying that they were not hit by a bomb and Louie is calmed and given hope from Phil's prayer. Finally, when Louie arrives at the prison camp, he meets a cabin guard who tells Louie that he can survive his beatings, and he takes this advice, as it reminds him that ""if you can take it you can make it.""<br/><br/>The movie tells the story from the perspective of Louie and some characters are missing for parts of the story. For example, when Phil and Louie get separated, there was a significant part of the movie where viewers are uncertain if he survived the war. In addition, Pete provided significant influence and support to Louie, but viewers do not get to know him as a person. ""The Bird"" was a horrid person both in real life and in the movie, but the story provides no background on him. His history may have added an interesting perspective to the movie and how he became so cruel.<br/><br/>While Unbroken is action-packed, emotionally moving, and full of historical details, there are elements of the movie that may disturb some viewers. Violence and death are common elements of the movie. In the beginning, soldiers are killed in air battle, and Zamperini's friend, Mac, dies after about 30 days at sea. During the years in the POW camp, Zamperini and other suffer unimaginable abuse at the hands of the Bird. In one scene, Zamperini is beaten by what looks like hundreds of soldiers and is left to suffer on the grounds of the camp. While these scenes may be too heavy for some movies, they are not as graphic as many other war movies. The movie is rated PG-13, and much language and violence that was common to war is not present in this film. Editors likely eliminated more realistic elements of war to allow for a wider range of viewers. Another element of the movie that could be improved relates to some of the scenery and filmography. There are scenes in the movie that did not seem to be real or historically realistic. The initial scenes from the airplanes look too clear and perfect to be a war scene. The plane flew smoothly despite bullets penetrating it and killing some passengers. Also, when Zamperini is taken to the Tokyo radio station to speak to Americans, the buildings and setting seem too modern to be World War II Japan. Unbroken is a well made historical film that tells one man's victorious survival through great peril. Louie is quite a likeable character who will appeal very much to people in the ages 12 and up. Despite the lack of some realistic war elements, this film is still overall historically accurate and touching. This movie is best suited for families with older children, or history fans interested in WWII or American heroes."
"undeadfearz","7","1","2","15 September 2018"," People are missing the point.
","This will be a quick review, as having watched it for the second time recently I feel I understand was Jolie was trying to do here. I've read a lot of reviews saying it's just 2+ hours of grim and hopeless misery, save for the last 5 minutes of the film. It might shock people to know that that is the point. <br/><br/>The whole point of the spending so much time on the raft, or in the POW camps was to showcase how bad it was for the longest time possible - it mirrors what Zamperini went through, and isn't supposed to make you feel triumphant or warm. No matter what happens to you, you stick through it - but sticking through it doesn't mean every little victory is felt as such. For those waiting for the fanfare of surviving being punched by every other prisoner, I got news for you - there wasn't. The movie only takes liberty in this regard with the lifting of the timber. <br/><br/>The point I'm getting at is that the movie does away with the traditional 'stiff upper lip' theme that a lot of war movies present, despite the fact that the mantra of ""If you can take it, you can make it"" being echoed throughout the runtime. There was no reward and no accomplishment felt when Zamperini continued to endure the torture and the starvation, and the movie hammers it home by making sure we endure as much of it as possible. <br/><br/>Of course this doesn't' make the movie perfect, the flashbacks to Zamperini's childhood are all too cliched, and stand out like a sore thumb in contrast to the rest of the film's subversion of expected emotion. The ending also feels a bit weird, and suddenly goes upbeat as we read what happened to Zamperini after the war. This was possibly due to the tragic fact that he passed away the same year the film released, and it felt only fair to celebrate his life, despite that not being the point of the movie. <br/><br/>In summary, the movie is not going to be for everyone. It is grim, dark and showcases the endurance Zamperini made in detail, and thats exactly the point. It is also shot fairly well, and Desplat's score is something to be noted."

","'Unbroken' is a great film, helped immensely by the fact it's based on an almost-unbelievable true story. Laura Hillenbrand's novel was one of the best I've read in the last three years and while the movie isn't quite as great (they never are!), the story of Louis Zamperini (O'Connell)'s extremely eventful life from 1936-1945 truly needs to be seen to be believed. Quick synopsis: he learns to run, goes to the Olympics, joins the U.S. Air Force during WWII, is shot down, stranded at sea (for seven weeks!), eventually captured by the Japanese and spends over two years in a POW camp. Sounds impossible, but what's more astonishing is that he then went on to live for another 70 years!<br/><br/>Jolie's directing debut is solid, with some nice transitions from the current to his past and the narrative moving along at a good pace for the first 90min. my one issue with the film is that the final 45min or so drag a little, as although there's plenty going on during his time in the POW camps (i.e. mostly inhumane torture), the film seems to lose a bit of it's spark. Brisbane/Moreton Bay does a good job of standing in for the South Pacific too!<br/><br/>This is not so much a film about war, as about survival, courage and hope. There's so many times when he could have just given in and let all the terrible things happening to him defeat him, but he doesn't. It's truly amazing to know it actually happened! The ending is handled well and the actors - particularly Ishihara as the psychopathic 'Bird' - are solid."

","Unbroken (2014): Dir: Angelina Jolie / Cast: Jack O'Connell, Domhnall Gleeson, Finn Wittrock, Miyavi, Garrett Hedlund: Heart pounding true story about perseverance under the most dire extremes. Set during World War 2 and regards athlete Louis Zamperini who is part of a troop aboard a bomber plane against Japan. Flashbacks showcase his upbringing from being bullied to stealing to getting into running, thanks to his older brother. During a rescue mission their plane malfunctions and they crash into the ocean. With only three survivors they spend some two months aboard rubber rafts feeding mainly on fish, and at one point, a shark. One of them passes away and the two remaining are discovered by Japanese soldiers and put in a POW camp. The highlights here is the beatings Zamperini receives at the hands of Mutsuhiro Watanabe who is also known as ""The Bird."" His aim is to break Zamperini's spirit but is constantly insulted at the resilience. This is not always easy to watch but Angelina Jolie allows viewers to sense what a POW camp can be like as well as the threat of hunger when stranded at sea. The real Zamperini passed away in 2014 and apparently ran in the Olympics in Japan even as old as eighty. He chose to forgive his oppressors and sought union with Japan. It is noted, however that Watanabe refused to accept his forgiveness. With strong acting and a harrowing productions of dropping bombs and air fights, Jolie makes this a passion project of extreme oppression overthrown by an Olympic winner whose first victory was remaining unbroken and choosing to forgive.

","Released in 2014, ""Unbroken"" chronicles the true-life story of Louie Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) who ran the 5000 meter race in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and later joined the US Army Air Corps for WWII. Upon crashing in the Pacific he and two others (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Witrock) must survive on a raft for almost seven weeks. When found by the Japanese they're placed in a POW camp and suffer the wrath of the commandant (Miyavi). Will they survive? <br/><br/>Directed by Angelina Jolie and scripted (partly) by the Coen brothers and based on Zamperini's biography by Laura Hillenbrand, this is a totally realistic account of Louie's war-time trials and was a minor hit at the box office. What was it like being in the air on a bombing mission over Japan taking hits by nigh-suicidal Jap planes? What was it like to survive on a raft in the Pacific week after week? What was it like to live in a Japanese POW camp? ""Unbroken"" shows you without amping-up the melodramatics and action. This explains why some viewers call it ""bland"" and what have you. They're so used to ""Die Hard,"" ""GI JOE"" and 007 that movies that aim for real-life bore them. That said, I don't want to come off as a film snob because I DO understand their criticism. It just comes down to what you want out of a movie, real-life or blockbuster theatrics? So before watching this movie you have to psychologically prepare yourself for a film akin to other realistic war biographies, like 2002's ""The Pianist,"" 2006' ""Rescue Dawn"" and 2014's ""American Sniper."" If you want ""Spectre"" you should skip ""Unbroken."" <br/><br/>The movie is long enough as it is and therefore doesn't depict Louie's later PTSD and alcoholism or his Billy Graham-inspired reconciliation to God, although it mentions these things in the postscript. In any case, ""Unbroken"" accomplishes precisely what it set out to do, put Louie's story to film for the world to see, and it does it very well. It may not be exceptional like 1957's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" but – being a biography – it never set out to compete with that film.<br/><br/>The film runs 137 minutes and was shot in eastern Australia.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","An extremely powerful and effective World War 11 film dealing with the life of Lou, a 1936 American athlete at the Berlin Olympics.<br/><br/>Under impressive direction by Angelina Jolie, the film shows us his early life where he was called all sorts of derogatory terms for being Italian and how he overcame this. This and his running achievements as an athlete gave him the new found encouragement to survive treatment in a Japanese internment camp for soldiers, where brutality was common every moment with the most barbaric acts perpetrated against the prisoners. The Japanese knew they had an Olympic hero in their midst and they saved a lot of that brutality for him.<br/><br/>His surviving was utterly amazing as he withstood plenty of torture and refused the easy way out by not participating in anti-American Japanese propaganda which would have made his stay in Japan a totally different story.<br/><br/>A great film of determination and overcoming perils and obstacles all along the way."

","Unbroken tells Louis Zamperini's story who was an Olympian athlete and were in the American army during the WWII where he went through unimaginable situations. It's a tough movie to watch for showing the cruelty and horrors men did to each other in this dark period of human history but it is also a very inspiring film a lot because of Louis Zamperini's personality. Visually speaking, the set design, make-up and photography are well-done,they manage to create a convincing environment and along with the physical transformations which actors endured to be fit in their roles made the film more realistic. Without spoiling anything, Unbroken was having a compelling and harsh story that was making the audience startled for witnessing what Lou went through, but from a certain point, the film isn't impactful as it was, even if the worst and painful scenes happen after this point. <br/><br/>Jack O'Conell plays Louis Zamperini, his performance is impressive,he delivers an emotional and inspiring character. The supporting cast fails to pass the same strength and confidence, having Domhnall Gleeson playing Phil as an exception, when he and Jack O'Connell are on the screen, they deliver intense and heartbreaking scenes. Miyavi as Watanabe, The bird, left much to be desired in his performance. He seemed often displaced making this character not shocking as he should be, although he was one of the greatest responsible for the suffering of Louie Zamperini during his captivity in Japan."

Very little time was spent on his early years and no time spent on his life after WWII and quest to find religion and the brutal prison guard, which he did.

","The true story of the wartime experiences of American Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini, this is he directorial debut of Angelina Jolie.<br/><br/>The raw material is excellent. An immigrant who achieves Olympic glory for his adopted country, survival at sea after a crash landing, and victimisation in a Japanese POW camp by brutal captors. But somehow, Jolie's inexperience results in a story hat drags, and lacks dramatic tension. This is further compounded by an inappropriate title, as by the end Zamperini is broken.<br/><br/>Production values are high, and the cinematography is excellent throughout. But the dialogue is poor, and the editing weak. Throughout, Jolie thinks that she is lingering to great dramatic effect, when she should have moved on.<br/><br/>A two hour twenty running time is appropriate to the story, but Jolie does not know how to either tell a story, or fill the time.

","The movie I'm going to talk about is unbroken and there are three main topics I would like to talk about. The first topics I would like to talk about is how Louie Zamperini didn't have any friends because he was different than other little boys. Louie try to get allow with them but they would just beat him up because he didn't have any back up or anyone for say. After a while he didn't care and started to run. The next topic I'm telling you about is how no matter where Louie is always getting hurt. When he is with the Japan's place he gets hit with a stick and get kicks by the owner of the place. My last topic is when he is in the war camp they go through so much stuff in little time. They don't get much food and they don't get a break at all if they do it is only before they go bed. <br/><br/>The movie was understandable when you watch but if you missed a part you will not understand what happen. Some of the flash back scenes I didn't understand what was going on but then it went back and I understand it a lot better. Some of the music you didn't hear a lot unless you were listening for it which we had some. Some of these were help to the story. Unbroken was to short they should have made it a little longer. I really didn't like the movie because it was a lot of mean thing that happen to Louie and when they are at the war camp they get beat up. I think the movie should be seen by PG-13 and I think it is about 2.8 stars."
"maurice_yacowar","7","1","2","24 January 2015"," US Olympics runner survives WW II crash and POW camp
","Louie Zamperini is not broken by an impressive range of challenges: vicious rejection as an Italian immigrant by his schoolmates, his lack of confidence, an unconditionally loving family, a race competitor who tries to trip him, the interruption of his Olympics dream by WW II, a plane crash, 48 days floating in the ocean, the temptation to hog the chocolate ration, the temptation to despair, then torture in a Japanese POW camp. Any one of these could have ruined an ordinary mortal but Louie gets through them all. That's the American immigrant way.<br/><br/>The film uses a WW II survivor for a model lesson how to deal with current war. A period film is always about the time it's made, as much as about the time it's set. Otherwise, why tell THAT story now? It's not named explicitly here, but the current war and temptation to submit is radical Islam -- which means ""submission"" -- and its intention to destroy Western Civilization and all its freedoms. Louie's repeated lesson — ""If you can take it, you can make it.""— seems more heartening against the old Axis than against the new ISIS. As the evil commander knows, torturing a third party breaks the will of those who can take torture themselves. The rampant sacrifice of the innocent is what makes Hamas, Hezbollah and ISIS so savage.<br/><br/>A postscript adds a second moral. When the war is over forgive your enemies. We're told the real life Louie went back to Japan to make peace with bis captors — and was only refused by the camp commandant The Bird. Initially The Bird sees in Louie a kindred man of strength — and breaks down trying to break him. So the lesser man's refusal later to make peace is predictable. We may expect to see the commander's ceremonial suicide, but instead he skulks off to hide until he's forgiven in a wider amnesty. <br/><br/>The film's most heartening shot is of the real 80-year-old Zamperini running with the torch at the later Tokyo Olympics. All things come to those who survive. Rocky goes to war.<br/><br/>Director Angelina Jolie shows she can direct as well as any man, especially in the opening air battle, the crash and the drawn out suspense in the close-space raft scenes. But in narrative and thematic terms the film retreats from her masterful, more complex and astonishingly neglected earlier war film, In the Land of Blood and Honey (see my separate blog)."
"vistheindian","6","1","2","12 January 2015"," Well, a little broken
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Olympian Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), turned bombardier in WWII survives a plane crash into the ocean. He along with his crew-mates are left stranded on a raft for 47 days. Just when all hope is lost Louis enters another hell when he is captured by the Japanese navy and sent to a detention camp. This is the directorial debut of Angelina Jolie, and unfortunately the lack of directing experience does show when it comes to character development and story pacing. This film certainly has moments where it shines. It is well shot and acted, with the first half showing some potential for greatness. However, the second half feels overstretched without the depth of rest of the movie. In the end it's alright, but it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Coen brothers written WWII movie based on a true story. Sounds like a safe bet right? Well there is one wildcard here, the director is Angelina Jolie. Considering she has never been behind the camera before I had to consider the chance the movie would be rough around the edges. Turns out there is slightly more roughness than I had anticipated.<br/><br/>First off this is a impressive looking movie. The opening shot is of a bombing run over an enemy base while trying to survive the anti- air fire. It's intense with great cinematography, and you also see a lot of that even during the smaller intimate moments. The sets and look of the movie add to the tangibility of the horrors of being stranded on the ocean or being held and mistreated as a prisoner of war. Additionally, two of the main cast Jack O'Connell and Domhnall Gleeson were great in their roles. Both of them had to carry a significant part of the story, the friendship and comradery they have in the wake of the crash felt genuine. I really enjoyed watching the first half of the movie because it jumped between times before and during the war. So you get to see Louis' past and how it shaped him to handle the hellish circumstances he has been dealt.<br/><br/>With such an inspirational story, you would expect to be deeply moved by the film. Instead there are some missteps taken that hinder Unbroken from reaching its potential. I just mentioned how I enjoyed the structure of the first half showing two time-lines, it added the much needed emotional weight. However, that structure is completely abandoned once Louis is captured by the Japanese navy. This would have been fine if the detention camp scenes carried the same weight. The problem is that the sense of consequence is completely non- existent for the rest of the movie. For example, there would be a scene where Louis would be beaten senselessly, to the point he can't stand or loses consciousness, but then next scene is the very next day of him sitting pretty with a nicely combed greased hair and a single scar on his cheek. This happens so often and for so long that I wasn't as invested in him anymore. What's the point if he brushes everything off so easily the next scene? He may be a hero in real life, but he is not a superhero. A good villain could have redeemed this part of the movie, but even that was poorly handled. Takamasa Ishihara, who plays the camp's officer in command comes off as a very shallow and generic villain, being evil just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>All the right ingredients are there but somewhere along middle the recipe was meddled with. Overall, Unbroken is a watchable film thanks to its cinematography and decent acting. I wouldn't recommend a full price ticket, but it is worthy of a Netflix stream. Main issue is that too much time and effort is put on the invincibility of the characters rather than their vulnerability. This results in a film that feels somewhat underwhelming and unrelatable at certain moments.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","I went into this movie knowing only a little about the story, but for the most part I enjoyed it. I was hooked right away, and I especially liked the performance of O'Connell, Gleeson, and Ishihara.<br/><br/>The movie's downfall is the story structure. I find it interesting that a lot of critics note how the story does not have a strong ending. Well, frankly, that's because Louis Zamperini's turning point was not in a raft or a Japanese POW camp--it was when he went to a Billy Graham conference.<br/><br/>The end text talks about how Zamperini gave his life to God, but the movie wants you to believe what made him the man he was the experience depicted in the movie. In reality it was his struggle back into civilian life, to forgive his enemy, and ultimately to commit his life to God, as he promised during the storm.<br/><br/>I tend to rate on the lower end, so I'm giving it 6/10. Not enough in it to give it a 7. Acting performance was 9/10, but the story and some of the VFX lacked. See it if you read the book, otherwise move on or wait for DVD."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","2","8","26 December 2014"," Good, not great
","It would not be unreasonable to accuse Angelina Jolie of steering her directing career down the same path that has offered great success to Kathryn Bigelow. Bigelow, of course, has had great success with two recent, hard-hitting (not to mention Oscar-winning) war dramas, The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty and so Jolie, it seems, is trying to chart the same course by directing war dramas of her own. First she directed the so-so In the Land of Blood and Honey, a 2011 romance set against the Bosnian War. Now, she gives us Unbroken the true story of Olympic runner and WWII POW Louis Lamperini. Both films have their merits, but what is clear is that Jolie has a long way to go before her directing career hits its stride. To be blunt, Bigelow is simply more experienced, and a better storyteller.<br/><br/>That's not to say that Jolie doesn't have talent. She knows how to organize a scene. Take the film's opening in which Jolie (who does not act in this film) throws us squarely into the action. We're onboard a B-24 bomber that is attacked by Japanese fighter planes. Everything that can go wrong, does. The plane malfunctions, the crew panics, and all along we're right in the thick of things. We are cramped into the confined spaces with the crew of this aircraft so we feel what they feel. She has a great sense of pacing and she knows how to organize an action sequence. All through the movie, she stages individual scenes like that, sometimes to great effect, but when you string it all together you realize it doesn't matter so much as a whole.<br/><br/>Unbroken tells the true story of Louis Lamperini (Jack O'Connell), the son of Italian immigrants who spent his early years as a trouble maker until his life was altered by his brother Pete (Alex Russell) who discovered that the kid was a fast runner. Year after year, Pete trains his brother to be a great athlete, and even takes him all the way to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Flush from that success (he won the gold), Lamperini joined the Air Force, got shot down and spent years in a Japanese POW camp. That's a lot of adventure for one life and you have to admire the journey he takes.<br/><br/>The most effective moments are the highlights, especially the scenes of Lamperini and crew attempting to survive on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Or enduring physical punishment from the Japanese while being held in a prison camp. They're great as individual moments, but where the movie stumbles is in letting us get to know Lamperini as a person. Most people will never have heard of Louis Lamperini, and I am grateful that Jolie chose this lesser known story rather than somebody we know all too well. But we never really get to know him as a person. We follow his journey but he seems at arm's length from us. British actor Jack O'Connell does a good job in the lead role, but when it was over I felt I had seen the red letter moments of his life, not the intimate details. I got the frosting, but not the cake.<br/><br/>Still, this is a well made film. It is beautifully shot, very well acted by a no-name cast, and it has moments that approach greatness. Jolie has a lot of talent as a filmmaker. I expect that her films will get better. This is a good one, not a great one."

For me personally though, I enjoyed most of it. It was well acted, along with enough small humor and disturbing scenes to keep it interesting throughout.<br/><br/>I didn't like that almost half of the film takes place when he gets stranded after the plane crash. 3 guys floating in raft can only be so interesting on film. It was an amazing feat that he survived 45 or so days out at sea and they had to come up with resourceful ways to survive. but 30 minutes of that was a bit much in my opinion.<br/><br/>He then gets ""rescued"" by the Japanese and goes through all types of torture. These scenes may be hard to watch but it's not graphic just disturbing. Yet this guy pushed through everything and made it to the end of the war alive.<br/><br/>The last scene explains in a few sentences what happens after the movie takes place. This is what most people were upset about. Quite frankly, there is no way this could've been filmed and not have this movie be 4 or 5 hours. I feel that deserves a story of its own.

","A true story is no guarantee for a good movie. That's the lesson we can learn from Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. The movie is based on the biography of Louis Zamperini, an American Olympic track champion who joins WW2 and experiences near death on the ocean and almost gets killed in a Japanese concentration camp. When the war is over, he returns home.<br/><br/>That's the story, frankly. The end credits roll on the screen after he is reunited with his parents and brother on an American airport. No more scenes about being home in the States. Fade out: this is the end.<br/><br/>However, thanks to these end credits we also learn that he later went back to Japan to face and forgive his Japanese camp guards and as an old man sees a dream come true when he carries the torch for the Olympic Games in Japan. Especially the forgiving part is exciting. Why didn't Angelina Jolie show us that? Why didn't she use the Saving Private Ryan structure and tell the story as a flashback, showing Zamperini visiting his Japanese opponents in the present while thinking back of his time during WW2? It would have made the movie much better.<br/><br/>Unbroken is a well made drama. The war scenes with the airplanes in the beginning of the movie are very well done. The flashbacks to his youth as a problem child are also impressive. But once the bad times begin, the movie falls flat. Yes, it's impressive what the real Louis Zamperini had to experience to survive World War 2. But shown from the eyes of director Angelina Jolie it soon becomes pretty boring.<br/><br/>Unbroken is a great monument but a flawed film. With this material Jolie could have done much better."

","The story of survival and robbed of all emotion. The acting was very good. Lost at sea and fighting their way out of a Chinese camp while they were men of war. Filthy working and getting beaten and starved to death. Their humanity is ripped from then, nothing to hold onto.<br/><br/>It would have been better if the movie would have shown what his family was going through at the same time he wrote that message. This is one of those movies that have those burst of instincts like something is going to happen. But nothing ever does. And it goes on and on. It also would have been cool if Jolie would have put more details in at the end of the movie, like about his life and how it changed his families life and his life. How he was when he got out of the camp. The story of Louis Zamperini is only half told in unbroken because I read stories and stories about him even looked him up on the internet. And I found out that his life post-war, in my opinion, was equally emotional, meaningful as his POW years. In his POW years his tortures were really long in the movie.<br/><br/>I think she over exaggerated a little bit. The flash back scenes did not make any sense to me at all. Jolie went to overboard. Not a lot of the backrounds didn't seem realistic like when they were on the lifeboats they didn't make everything the same as the previous scenes. The water was different shades of blue. The hairstlyes were groomed and brushed to look good. The music was good. It set the mood and place at the right moment. To be honest I didn't even pay attention to the music. But that's how I knew something was going to happen."

","Catchy title: the great unbroken Synopsis: the film was about a war veteran who was beaten to death at this Japanese camp and he does work for them and he stays at that camp when the war ends they are free and gets to go back home. Director: Angelina Jolie The actors were chosen very well. Jack O'Connell was Louie zaperhini, takamasa ishihara was the Japanese soldier The story of unbroken was understandable during the whole movie. The flash back scenes was good and made since and followed along with the movie. Scenery-music: yes the background seem realistic but the sharks didn't really look real. The costumes and everything else like hairstyles could be shorter but the cars and houses and stuff were the time and place. When it was war it was like loud bangs and when they were getting abused and it was like sad music or whatever. The music helped when something was going to be bad or other things. My review: the movie was a great movie and the scenes were awesome and I love watching war movies and other things but there isn't really and negatives about the movie except and kind of have more action in it. It was the right of amount of time with the right amount of time for the movie. My recommendation: I would recommend my parents or older teenagers to watch it because it's a great movie and that if they like war movies it be perfect for them. Rating: my rating is 5 because it a great war movie I've seen."
"twidau","8","1","3","27 April 2015"," Not so broken
","The movie Unbroken is about a young man, Louis Zamperni (Jack O'Connell) who starts out as an Olympic athlete turned soldier. This is about his struggle through pain and suffering, through years of torture and living in fear. Director Angelina Jolie takes charge in the making of this fascinating true story. The actors portrayed their given characters very well. Jack O'Connell portrayed his character in a very believable way. As well as Jack O'Connell playing his character well, Japanese actor and singer Miyavi portrayed his character Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a Japanese war Army sergeant, very well. The story flowed in a pretty understandable way. The scenery-music fit in with the story very well. It was played when appropriate. The music helped in telling the story by certain songs were placed at the perfect times and it all flowed nice and smooth. The music added to the mood by using dramatic music when appropriate. As well as the music fitting in, the background scenery fit in as well. It really helped make the story look more realistic. The costumes and hairstyles also helped in making the story believable. I think that this was a great film seeing as I am a WWII buff. I love everything about WWII. At times though, the story seemed very not believable, but most of the time it all flowed nicely. I feel this film was the right length, maybe even a few more minutes could have been added on. I would recommend this movie to all adults and older children or anyone interested in WWII. If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a solid 4/5."
"Polonius85","5","1","3","23 March 2015"," Wanted to like this more because of the book
","I know, it's what EVERYONE says about every movie based on a book: The book was better; don't see the movie till you read the book. Generally, I hate that pretentious attitude. However, in this case, I have to break my own rule and say, forget the movie, read the book.<br/><br/>Now, this movie wasn't Razzie terrible; the acting and the action sequences were good. But there was WAY too much left out, there was no chemistry between any of the characters, and the movie just seemed to drag at many points. There's very, very little dialog and for a movie that is supposed to be about overcoming, the tone was very unemotional and depressing throughout. They failed to show the camaraderie among the prisoners, the subtle insurgency against the sadistic guards, or just how The Bird affected Louis. I also was disappointed to see that they cut out Louis' whirlwind marriage, battle with PTSD, coming to faith in God, and recovery from his demons when he came home. We are treated to a brief epilogue explaining quickly that all this happened.<br/><br/>It was a very long, detailed book, and Laura Hillenbrand did an excellent job developing the story of who Louis was and the importance of just about everyone with whom he came in contact. When I first heard this movie was being made, I couldn't fathom how they could fit it into a 2 to 3 hour movie. To tell you the truth, I was right. They couldn't, and didn't. It's really a pity; the story on which this is based has ""best picture"" written all over it, but the filmmakers just fell short. As I said, a very difficult task considering their source material. In all honesty, it would have been better to adapt Unbroken to an HBO miniseries, ala Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>All in all, not a horrible movie, but a disappointment nonetheless. Read the book."
"shawneofthedead","6","1","3","13 February 2015"," Well-shot and well-acted, but the film is too much a one-note story of survival against the odds.
","Truth is stranger than fiction, so they say, a point fairly well- proved by the life and experiences of Louis Zamperini - a man who competed in the Olympics, survived almost fifty days while lost at sea, and endured untold torture as a prisoner-of-war during WWII. Myths and legends can be constructed around any one of those feats; for them to be combined in one life is pretty darn extraordinary. Angelina Jolie's Unbroken - sporting a charmingly blunt title which pretty much gives away both plot and character trajectory in a single word - pays decent, beautifully-shot tribute to these defining moments in Zamperini's life, but somehow forgets to shine a spotlight on the man himself.<br/><br/>""If you can take it, you can make it"" is the motto young Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) inherits from his brother. And so a wayward boy with discipline problems finds himself training to be a track star. He gets so darn good that he impresses the world with a 56-second final lap at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In a few years' time, athlete becomes airman - Louis enlists as a bombardier with the US Army. When seeking a lost aircraft, the defective plane carrying Louis and his crew-mates breaks up over the Pacific Ocean - forcing sole survivors Louis, Phil (Domhnall Gleeson) and Mac (Finn Wittrock) to survive shark attacks and starvation on a pair of flimsy life-boats. For 47 days, Louis is cast adrift, but rescue doesn't equate to salvation. Instead, he's captured by the Japanese Navy and forced to spend the rest of the war in a POW camp, the pet target of brutal prison guard Mutsuhiro Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara).<br/><br/>Watching Unbroken is an odd experience. There's a lot of it that's very good indeed. Jolie certainly knows how to cut a scene together, injecting brutal tension into Louis' encounters with sharks of both the literal and metaphorical variety. It's difficult, and occasionally enlightening, to watch as Louis fends off physical attacks with memories of his mother's delicious gnocchi recipe, or stands his ground as every soldier in his camp is commanded to punch him in the face. Most touching of all is a moment when Louis touches civilisation and real food again in a Japanese commissariat, and must decide whether to turn his back on it for a life far cruder and darker. <br/><br/>And yet, the film never quite manages to conjure up much of an emotional impact - which is curious considering that it's so keenly focused on the triumph of the human spirit in the face of untold adversity. The problem here lies in the screenplay, though you wouldn't expect it since it's credited to experienced writers who have crafted considerably more artful and subtle works: Joel and Ethan Coen (Inside Llewyn Davis, No Country For Old Men), Richard LaGravenese (Behind The Candelabra, The Fisher King) and William Nicholson (Gladiator).<br/><br/>In effect, Unbroken exists in just one key: a sad but triumphal note of survival, with little else to colour in the complexities of all that Louis has suffered. Without exploring the real-life effects his days at sea or in a POW camp have had on him (including his descent into alcoholism and the recovery of his religious faith), Louis comes across as a stoic superhero: a man with such incredible fortitude that he becomes almost uninteresting in the process.<br/><br/>That's through no fault of Jolie's leading man. O'Connell does great work with what he's given, shedding his clean-cut good looks and innocence as the war drives blood, dirt and horror into his very soul. It's a shame, really, that he's not given more to do. Gleeson and Wittrock are quietly devastating as two young men trapped in a traumatic situation, each tested to their absolute limits by the hunger and horror of it all. Ishihara, better known to Asian audiences as rock star Miyavi, has been criticised for playing a comically shallow villain, but there's some depth to be found here - at least if you take the character of Watanabe (in reality one of the most wanted war criminals in Japan) as a metaphor for the trials of his own country and countrymen.<br/><br/>As a chronicle of one period in Louis Zamperini's remarkable life, Unbroken fares reasonably well. Every bit of it is vividly realised: from the war he lived through to the days he spent floating on the open ocean. The entire film is handsomely shot in almost painterly style, the cinematography by renowned director of photography Roger Deakins rich with detail and colour. But Unbroken never really asks us to care about its protagonist; we are simply called upon to admire him. That's an easy enough task for any audience to accomplish. The film would have worked far better, however, if it had dared to depart from its title once in a while: to show us a man who became whole again when the world conspired to break him."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","3","3 February 2015"," Lacks investment in character.
","This time last year we thought the Best Picture of 2015 was a done deal, albeit a thoroughly baity one. Unbroken makes no secret that it feels like Chariots of Fire + Life Of Pi + The Bridge on the River Kwai. Plus you got a team of the Coen brothers behind the script, Roger Deakins behind the camera (the aesthetics feel like Changeling 2.0) and director Angelina Jolie hot off an honorary Oscar. Nevertheless, the bait has failed and this will not be the Best Picture of the year. The Academy is wise to go for unconventional films Boyhood and Birdman for a refreshing change. There's nothing bad about Unbroken, it's just incredibly bland without anything new or insightful to say. The problem is that it doesn't once get you in Louis Zamperini's head. This is a very idyllic representation of him, and idyllic representations of characters are hard to latch onto.<br/><br/>Sure, you can chuck a barrage of punches on a character, but there needs to be a bigger reason to invest. Any dilemma he's faced with is greeted with contrived courage and sacrifice, as hard as Jack O'Connell tries to bring the character out in rare loud moments. The first 20 minutes of flashbacks are designed to persuade us to chant 'come on Louie' with the side characters, but it fails to give a convincing argument as to why. We know the theme of the film and the fact that he survived and so the film lacks a vital tension to keep it involving. However the film is never explicitly bad, though the episodic structure of the boat scenes needed development, it's simply weak where it could've had potential to be actually inspirational. It just doesn't give us enough beyond the surface when there was plenty of time to do so. Certainly watchable, but it's not a treat.<br/><br/>6/10"
"jadepietro","8","1","3","18 January 2015"," St. Louis
","This film is recommended. (Rating: ☆☆☆)<br/><br/>In this year of biographies, Unbroken breaks no new ground. It's a familiar tale of an American hero battling inhumane obstacles that would kill the normal man. In this case, it is the true life story of Louis Zamperini and his horrific days as a prisoner-of-war. <br/><br/>The film follows the winning formula of most biopics beginning with a troublesome adolescence, traumatic circumstances that lead to international glory, and an inspirational upbeat ending complete with actual photographs of the real person in the end credits. However, the story being told, with a screenplay contributed to four major talents (the Coen brothers, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson), is riveting drama and presented with much style and restraint. <br/><br/>Solidly at the helm is Angelina Jolie, making an impressive directing debut. The film is a huge undertaking and the actress wisely surrounds herself with an A-team of artisans that deliver superb production values. The gifted Alexandre Desplat gives the film a haunting quality that never overpowers the story. Roger Deakins' masterful cinematography transports the film to a high level of artistry with his stunning use of stark shadows and silhouettes. Unbroken may be convention storytelling, but it is a beautifully crafted filmgoing experience.<br/><br/>Most of the time, Jolie tends to play it safe, never straying out of the box. She keeps to the true-and-true formula similar to most WII tales: show the heroism and suffering but stress the inner strength, grit, and that all-inclusive American spirit. She lets her admiration of the man cloud her judgment, showing more saint than needed. This skews the film's emotion balance of the story and makes it seem forced and manipulative. <br/><br/>Jolie sets up the story into three distinct sections (using direct links of some classic films serving as her inspiration): the early years leading to Olympic fame (with a Chariots of Fire vibe, slow-motion intact) and the standard war saga, complete with sea survival tale(ala Jaws), and a prisoner-of-war epic story (saluting The Bridge of the River Kwai).<br/><br/>Jack O'Connell is very good as Mr Zamperini. He gives a heartfelt performance that spans nearly 20 years. Most of the other roles, except for Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Wittrock, are incidental and walking stereotypes. Especially so, is Takamasa Ishihara as the sadistic prison captain, Watanabe. As written, the role seems far too evil and one-note (although the actual war criminal was even more brutal than depicted here). The actor tries to overcome the cliché with varying success. <br/><br/>Unbroken is a solid war film that celebrates one man's remarkable life while elevating him to sainthood. It carries gung-ho patriotism under its sleeve and undercuts reality along the way, making the man into a myth and the film into a grand testament of courage and valor. GRADE: B"
"Turfseer","6","1","3","19 January 2015"," Jolie shows more talent for visuals than her generic portrait of Olympian and WW II Prisoner-of-War Hero
","Angelina Jolie's biopic of Olympian and World War II Prisoner of War, Louis Zamperini, almost falls into the category of hagiography. I agree with Kyle Smith writing in the New York Post that ""on a scene-by-scene basis, the film works perfectly well."" But I also agree with him somewhat that the movie is ""trite"" and ""thin of character."" I have never been a big fan of Angelina Jolie, but I can't help but feel she's endured some significant Jolie-bashing just because she is who she is. <br/><br/>While the ""Unbroken"" scenarists have trouble making Zamperini into something more than a generic hero, the basic facts of what he went through are gripping enough. Particularly in the two early sequences where Zemperini is a bombardier for the US Army Air Force on a B-24 bomber, Jolie shows her mettle in constructing some thrilling action scenes. <br/><br/>The flashbacks to Zamperini's childhood don't work as well as they're fraught with clichés. Joe Walsh in Cine Vue points out that Zamperini's brother ""encourages the young Louis to compete long distance running and provides trite motivational speeches. The emotional drive of these moments is there to kindle a sense of the rise to glory; hard work is demonstrated through a series of running montages that imitate Chariots Of Fire (1981), all of which adds up to be surprisingly dull."" <br/><br/>Jolie's attention to detail in recreating the 1936 Olympics is quite welcome and I found it interesting that Zamperini came in eighth in the 5,000 meter race he competed in but broke the record for the fastest fractions in the final lap (the fact that Zamperini was actually congratulated by Hitler is left out of the narrative; it might have been interesting if Jolie left that sequence in).<br/><br/>Perhaps the best sequence in the film is Zamperini's 47 day survival at sea. It's not only how he survived (of the two other men he was with, one of them died), but we also get a sense of what some of the other characters he interacted with, were all about.<br/><br/>Zamperini's sojourn as a Japanese prisoner of war pretty much sticks to the facts as detailed in the Hillenbrand biography. I found out that Zamperini was indeed punched by most of his fellow soldiers upon orders of the sadistic Sgt. Watanabe (aka ""The Bird""). Zamperini was also forced by Watanabe to hold a beam up, which he did for an extraordinary 37 minutes (although it seems like hours as Jolie frames it). Shooting the whole sequence as if Zamperini was some Christ-on-the-cross figure, was a bit too much! Including Zamperini's trip to Tokyo where he spoke on the radio and later declined to be part of Japanese propaganda broadcasts, was a fascinating digression in contrast to the scenes in the camp, ably highlighting his heroic demeanor.<br/><br/>Of the critics who weren't thrilled with aspects of ""Unbroken,"" some felt there was wasn't enough character development. Tim Robey writing in ""The Telegraph' bemoaned the exclusive focus on Zamperini: ""But when Louie's self-belief is the only subject on screen, which is gormlessly often, Jolie presses her young lead into a lot of face-pulling, anguished grimaces and screams of violent elation. We are not dragged deeply into either a man's soul or his character."" Joe Walsh said that Jolie, ""focuses too much of what he endured and how he survived such suffering, crafting a lackluster and dull film about an incredibly remarkable man.""<br/><br/>Unlike the classic ""Stalag 17,"" ""Unbroken"" fails to develop any of the characters of Zamperini's fellow prisoners of war. Justin Chang notices this shortcoming, writing in Variety: ""Jolie sensitively conveys the solemn intimacy and tender camaraderie that arise among men at war, but she never captures these soldiers in all their bawdy, rough-and-tumble vigor and rebellious energy; nor does she evoke the fire in Zamperini's belly that made him not just a survivor but a natural-born leader, his instincts and intellect as nimble as his feet.<br/><br/>Rodrigo Perez in ""The Playlist"" suggests that ""Unbroken"" is too long: ""Suffering from pacing and monochromatic tonal issues —various types of drab torture for two hours— ""Unbroken"" is also overlong and eventually settles into a slog with little narrative drive."" And Roger Moore in ""Movie Nation,"" finds the film derivative: ""But if we've seen the beatings, the maddening stretches of solitary confinement, the war of wills between the stoic serviceman and the sado-homosexual Japanese camp commander in one film, we've seen it in five–pretty much every film from ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" to ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"" to last year's ""The Railway Man.""<br/><br/>Lawrence Toppman, writing in the ""Charlotte Observer,"" felt there was quite a bit more to Zamperini's story, mainly dealing with his post-war experiences: ""We don't see his alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder after coming home, the decay of his marriage, the vengeful hatred that led him to strangle his captors in his nightmares. Nor do we see his conversion to Christianity after a 1949 Billy Graham crusade in Los Angeles, an event he credited with saving his sanity, marriage and perhaps his life. He was able to forgive his tormentors, even going back to Japan to try to do so in person. Perhaps the filmmakers were afraid his devout faith would consign their movie to the low-attendance ghetto where Christian movies often land."" <br/><br/>In the end, ""Unbroken"" held my interest. Jolie has more flair for the visual than the narrative, which, unfortunately, focused a bit too much on Zamperini's ""self-belief,"" and not other aspects of his character. The supporting players also got short shrift in terms of character development. All in all, ""Unbroken"" is worth watching, despite its shortcomings."
"CompuDoctor","Null","1","3","11 January 2015"," a story that continues after the movie
","This movie is an inspiration, the story follows a man who is an athlete through his life as a troubled youth and into his military career. When he is captured by the Japanese during WWII his fame as an athlete haunts him as he is the target of abuse by the prison camp commandant. The story carried you through his journey of faith and comes full circle by the end of the movie. The real life man who lived this movie so many years ago passed away in 2014, before the movie was released. This is a true hero who serves his country well and learns along the way. The movie feels complete, but the man in the movie continued to live his life after returning home. I want to recommend this movie, but also the book ""Louis Zamperini: Captured By Grace"" which tells the story of life after returning home a hero. Through the power of the Gospel—and his experience at the 1949 Billy Graham Crusade in Los Angeles—Zamperini overcame alcoholism, night terrors and a failing marriage to live a full and joyous Christ-centered life until his passing at age 97, inspiring millions along the way. This movie, and this book, obviously this man, are all inspirational. I highly recommend that you catch this film before it gets away!"
"Xoxobubsterxoxo","4","1","4","23 March 2015"," !Spoiler alert!
","So like most of the reviewers I did read the book before I watched the movie. I would rate the book a 10, considering it is probably one of the best books I've read. Now on to the movie, I most definitely did not like how the scenes were out of place. I think if they had told the story in order it would've been much easier to follow. Second I feel a really important part of the book is missing from the movie. Jimmie Sasaki. Louie's friend who turned out to be a Japanese spy, that he later meets at a POW camp.. Where is he at all? As well as how The Bird would make the POWs be his buddy after brutal beatings. Another is how the movie dragged... I could not put the book down, but the movie seemed to drag on. The acting was phenomenal! But the story could've been told much better. I would have been more than happy to sit through a 3 hour movie that kept me on my toes like the book, than sitting through the 2 hour movie that just didn't keep me as interested. I think the movie should've gone on to his post war life a little more than it did because he had a tremendous turnaround. And one last point before I end my tangent, it never shows the few guards that were nice to them? I think that really would've tugged at my heart had I seen that in the movie."
"Franco_Strydom","5","1","4","28 January 2015"," Could have, would have, should have, been so much more.
","The story behind this film is interesting - I don't like the fact that it opens by stating 'A True Story' as the art of film is consciously choosing a perspective, and 'truth' is, or at least should be, outside perspective. I would much prefer 'based on true events' or 'inspired by real events', that way the filmmaker acknowledges that there is more to the content than what will be presented. Moving along.<br/><br/>""Unbroken"" (Jolie 2014) is too long. It could easily have been an incredibly powerful miniseries of four one hour episodes as the story has four definite 'chapters'. Think ""Band of Brothers"" (Frankel 2001). This story has that much potential. The film does the story justice; there are some beautiful, powerful and beautifully powerful moments which makes the film work. There are however one or two moments where the emotions are indulged in and that breaks from the immersion a 'true story' should long for; every moment should to be completely believable. These moments make me question some of the creative license Jolie took with the detail of the facts which, if she did in fact not, means this film could have had a much greater effect on me.<br/><br/>For the fact that it is a single feature film, Jolie should have cut a lot of the content. The film is very obviously not a documentary which means narrative should be king (even where based on true events) and for this reason Jolie should have focused more on the moment, the people, the actions and the reactions than the amount of terrible things the characters had to survive. Taking any two of the four chapters, fleshing them out in terms of story and cutting down on the running time would have made this a stronger film.<br/><br/>Casting was well done, the actors look like the characters in a natural way. Jack O'Connell played a difficult role well for the most part. There are a few moments where you can see the actor trying to achieve an emotional and physical expression which he has very deliberately been directed into; which is a weakness. I do consider the fact that the actors had to portray people who had lived in horrible living conditions and that there is a definite threshold where your imagination starts filling in the blanks, it's usually around this point in time where disbelief sets in.<br/><br/>In terms of the quality of the film, it's top notch. The camera work and sound is great, the editing is mostly really good as well and any noticeable short comings really come down to story (as I've mentioned that the acting was effective as well – the short comings in the acting I credit to the short comings in the story and directing.<br/><br/>This is a good film, but it probably won't stay with you, it's memorable in that you will remember the greater story and the fact that this man survived a whole lot of terrible things, but you won't remember the man. You won't remember any one moment, and the moments you will remember you will remember as being obvious and forced."
"thale05","4","1","4","22 January 2015"," Consider Yourself Unbroken If You Endure Watching This Movie
","I'll go out and say this movie was hard to watch in both a good and bad way. While Angelina Jolie tells us this remarkable, painful story of endurance and triumph, it feels as if she left out so many things I wanted to know more about Louie Zamperini. You should expect to see a great movie from Legendary Pictures with contributions done by the legendary Coen brothers but you instead get a traditional survival movie with characters with absent character and clichéd dialogue. It is, to say the least, underwhelming.<br/><br/>So who is Louie Zamperini? And with that simple question comes the biggest problem of this movie. We really are not given an idea of what our protagonist is like, what kind of personality he has, and barely what motivates him to do what he does. I think a lot of people found the same problem with Superman in ""Man of Steel"" though I could tell our hero was conflicted, I could tell he had trouble relating with others, I was given a sufficient connection to him though he had the bare minimum of a personality. In ""Unbroken"", the only connection I could make with Louie was his tremendous experience WWII, as a serviceman. Speaking of ""Man of Steel"", this movie also has a non-chronological narrative in the first thirty minutes to give some backstory of Louie: only two instances of his life before his service. So what do we learn from these flashbacks? Well, as a kid, Louie got picked on, got in trouble, and got into track because his brother encouraged him to do so. Eventually he would attend the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany and that's it. The rest of the movie recounts his incredible ordeal during wartime.<br/><br/>By incredible, I do not say lightly. What this man goes through and how he pulls through is fascinating and deserves to be told. It begins when his aircraft goes down over the Pacific, leaving Louie and two other survivors stranded on two lifeboats. For 47 days, the three men are hunted by sharks, beaten down by exposure, and go to great lengths to get food. All of this could have been an entire movie by itself but our protagonist is capture by the Japanese to be held captive.<br/><br/>There's this really strange scene where Louie is questioned by an Imperial officer and his lines put into subtitles only to have a soldier translate everything he just said in English. What gives? Did the editor think we could not read the subtitles so he had someone else read for us? Trust is not a virtue in this flick, indeed.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing special. If anything, I found a lot of the actors wooden but given this film did not have empathetic script to begin with, it is excusable. Louie is played by Jack O'Connell who passes off with an okay performance. The one actor who stood out for me was Miyavi (that's his stage name) who plays a spoiled, Japanese officer known as the Bird who takes his disdain of his position out on his captives. He serves as the antagonist and combats Louie in a psychological war of endurance and suffering. Sure, the Bird's character is thinly written but interesting enough to make a good villain.<br/><br/>The second act centers on Louie during his time as a POW; this is where the movie becomes hard to watch. Our hero is beaten mercilessly with belts and sticks in needlessly prolonged sequences. The Bird even makes each prisoner punch poor Louie in the head. I am surprised this movie held onto a PG-13 rating. You'd wonder if Mel Gibson was behind the camera at this point.<br/><br/>The credits were rolling and I was baffled to see the Coen brothers listed under ""Written By"" with two other talented writers. Just look up the work these four men have done and tell me with a straight face you are not surprised to see them write a rehashed, conventional script for this movie. It feels as if their visions collided in a death match only to have a simple underdog come out on top. At least it never got to sappy territory, it was possible though. There's this one part where the Bird forces Louie to pick up a piece of wood and all the POWs in the camp halt work to watch in silence. Yeah, aren't the Japanese soldiers supposed to be supervising their prisoners?<br/><br/>From all that I have told you, it sounds like I do not like this movie. No, not really. I am disappointed Jolie did not go all out and take reasonable advantage of a great story given to her on a silver platter. With that said, the story itself is worth seeing but you're going to have to deal with one-dimensional characters and brutal torture to appreciate the trials this man had to go though. ""Unbroken"" is broken and ends up as wasted potential.<br/><br/>My Rating: 4/10"
"Coneydogg","Null","1","4","20 January 2015"," A massive disappointment being that the true story is so remarkable.
","I don't like to bash someone that appeared to try so hard but, as director, Angelina Jolie delivered a huge rambling misfire. <br/><br/>This was like making a movie about Wyatt Earp and fixating on his time in Dodge City by focusing on bouts of diarrhea, illness and tough times while ignoring his exploits as sheriff, his Tombstone years and the gunfight at the O.K. Corral. Spending scene after scene watching Louis Zamperini being tortured and suffering just wears thin. Instead of placing any focus on his faith or his time after the war the movie spends far too much time adrift. Literally, a major portion of the film is spent watching three men trying to survive on a life raft in the middle of the ocean. The final words before the credits and the real life scenes of him at age 80 were more interesting than the entire third act itself. THAT is what I would have liked to have seen. Cut down all that repetitive ocean and prisoner camp tediousness and there would have been ample room to tell the story right and with emotional impact.

I nearly walked out during the raft scenes. It just seemed to drag and drag. I think the intent was to deliver an emotional journey of incredible willpower and inner strength but in the end, it seemed to me as a great story with a somewhat boring journey. I get that the characters were trying to be developed for a better understanding of who/what they were all about but some of the scenes and characters left me just scratching my head wondering.......

","'UNBROKEN': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>World War II flick directed by Angelina Jolie and co-written by the Coen brothers. It's based on the book 'Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience and Redemption', by Laura Hillenbrand, and tells the story of USA Olympian Louis Zamperini. The film details how he survived 47 days on a raft, after his bomber crashed in the ocean, and many more days of torture and harassment at multiple POW camps, during the war. It stars Jack O'Connell, Domhnall Gleeson, Miyavi, Garrett Hedlund, Finn Wittrock and Jai Courtney. It was adapted for the screen by Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson and it's Jolie's third directorial effort (to date). The film has done well at the Box Office (thus far) but it's also gotten mostly negative reviews from critics. So it's possible upcoming award recognition has become uncertain. I enjoyed the movie but it's certainly not a great film and it's definitely not one of the best of the year, either.<br/><br/>O'Connell stars as Louis Zamperini, an Olympic athlete who also served as a bomber pilot during World War II. His plane crashed in the Pacific Ocean, where he (and two other crew members) lived on a raft for 47 days. Zamperini was then caught by the Japanese navy and sent to multiple prisoner-of-war camps. He went on to survive years of grueling physical, and mental, torture while being abused by a sadistic Japanese corporal (Miyavi), who was jealous of his athletic accomplishments. The film shows how Zamperini used his athletic abilities, and Olympic training, to push on and survive. <br/><br/>The film is well made, from a technical standpoint, and Jolie definitely shows some skill, and talent, as a director. The acting is all decent enough and the story is interesting and somewhat inspiring. It just seems like it should have been more involving (and moving). I definitely never felt that emotionally interested, in anything going on in the movie. While it is entertaining, it also doesn't leave the viewer with much to think about (or even look back on and admire) after it's over. It's a good war film, especially for those who love the genre, but it's certainly not a great one; or an Oscar worthy film by any means.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/XBTsoCDCJpU"
"scottshak_111","6","1","4","6 January 2015"," Zamperini's survival story charred by average direction and poor editing
","What separates a great movie from a good one? Direction? Well, then Jolie misses it by an inch. Albeit, she might reach it someday given the experience she is gradually garnering under her director's tattoo. However sadly she isn't still there.<br/><br/>The biopic we have in hand is a survivor's tale of Louis Zamperini embodied by Jack O' Connell. He isn't a hero exactly, but someone who has been through the ugly guts of war. The drama reeks of war perversion. But at some point it makes you compare it with the likes of 'The Last Castle'. Jack isn't Redford however he still gives his best. Takamasa is not exactly James Gandolfini and misses facial expressions by light years.<br/><br/>Things that were outrageous were: Louis's stint as an athlete a bland story that picked pace without any powerful interest or focus. The story itself did not throw light on any of his heroics except at one point where Louis' decision reflects simply doing the right thing. It misses the point of the movie to show the athlete who inadvertently got lost into war owing to an unfortunate event. The script demanded quality thought spent into the melodrama it should have retained.<br/><br/>Some of the best bits of the movie were placed right at the ingress. Like the fight sequences that were portrayed happening beautifully around the tenacious bomber and manifested through different vantage point via aircrew's eyes. Zamperini's pining for survival in an ocean of sharks marred by devastating hunger (watch out for that albatross bit), punishing tides, hopeful rain, and the dark life that followed therefrom were beautifully shown.<br/><br/>Jolie tries to venture into subtlety by showing the filth of war: trodden books, corpses, loss and grief, however fails to portray the exact image of her emotions through her insipid presentation. The plot just loses focus owing to the slow pace it carries throughout without a lucid screenplay to hold the viewers riveted. Even though the Coen brethren came up with the flick's screenplay it hardly retains all the dramatic substance that matters. <br/><br/>The editing too is pathetic. Her style of film-making is good for dramas, yet what Jolie still needs to find is a really good script that is mesmerized with some class screenplay.<br/><br/>There are some movies that make you pity its ill-fated actor, make you empathize with the protagonist, feel the pain. I was surprised to find out that nothing in this flick made me feel his pain. This again shoots a dozen questions at the direction.<br/><br/>Average alert! Watch only if you have a lot of time to kill."
"TheFilmGuy1","6","1","4","4 January 2015"," Perhaps Just Stick With The Book
","Unbroken is a mixed bag. On one hand, it feels like extreme Oscar- bait and over done, but on the other, it feels like it shows potential in Angelina Jolies' directing skills and I don't think it should be completely torn apart like a lot of people are doing.<br/><br/>I think the strongest thing about this is the general story. It's based on a true story, and it really is incredible. Much respect to the actual men who went through this, because it obviously takes a strong person to get through it. Obviously this is the theme of the film. Staying strong through tough times and being ""unbroken"" so to speak. But sadly a good performance from Jack O'Connell and some occasionally nice cinematography and directing by Jolie isn't enough. The film tries way to hard to be that film that makes you cry because the character is so strong and the whole time you feel the film saying ""give me an Oscar! Look! Emotion! Hardships!"" instead of straight up showing you a situation that a strong man got through, and that's its biggest issue. In that sense, films like Rescue Dawn do it much better. This feels to artificial and tries too hard. Not much in the film itself got an emotional response, EXCEPT for the final words before the credits, that actually show the real Louis Zamperini, running the Olympic torch in Japan. It's such a strong image to see and almost brought a tear to my eye. But I guess that shows it might have been better as a documentary of sorts.<br/><br/>There was also some odd moments throughout. Zamperini and two other men find themselves floating out at sea, and in a really great scene at night we see sharks surrounding them. This builds tension extremely well, but I found it ruined when it climaxes with a kind of laughable jump scare where the shark jumps out at a character. It could have been done smoother, and the theater I was in laughed at it. In fact, they laughed at a lot of stuff. While I do think it was partially to do with the younger age of the people in the theater, I think a better film wouldn't have had them laughing. The character of Watanabe is supposed to be a terrifying Japanese internment camp leader, but occasionally comes across as weird of laughable. I guess that sums up a lot of sequences. Could have been really moving or shocking, but kind of came across as weird.<br/><br/>In the end, I thought it was okay. The runtime of 2 hours and 17 minutes feels more like 3 hours and 17 minutes because of some dragging, but I'm glad I learned about Zamperini and his story, because it's worth hearing. Jolie shows potential to be a good director, but doesn't quite hit the mark, and O'Connel gives a strong performance. It's worth a watch, just to see for yourself, but perhaps just reading the book is a better choice."

","Some people live extra-ordinary lives but no journey of life can be accurately described as just ordinary but instead referenced for contrasting purposes. All Life remains and stands as the mysterious gift it is. I read the book which is a page turner and one of the best reading values around and it is a thick and rich source of detail material. It must have been challenging to the Director to reduce this to just a measly two hour plus movie. As a business venture, it may pay off. But some things should not be based solely on rate of return but contribution to society as a whole. It may interest you to know that the Japanese people were ruthless and focused as well as formidable when at war and if not for the Emperor's command to stand down would have all died fighting to the last man bar none and taken millions of their enemies with them. Their mandate to fight and win was superior as was the Germans during the world war. It was the Americans who were poorly trained, outfitted and briefed while taken by complete surprise of war and how it respects no one. This cost many American lives. I was not able to fully grasp the individual whose life story this movie was based on as exceptional. Our history is replete with many similar known and unknown stories of this nature. What wasn't documented would over-whelm for its contents...remember, no two life journeys alike either. Worth the price of a ticket, two hours plus and a tasty drink and snack, bounce your own extra-ordinary life off of this movie and tweak accordingly...."

"YoungCriticMovies","6","1","5","13 January 2015"," Partly Broken: A Film Whose Faults Are Covered Up By Great Directing and Performance
","I missed these journeyed and inspiring World War II films. I thought that the stories had all been dried up, but Louie Zamperini's story surprises us all; how could such a story not have been told before? Angelina Jolie's bold directing surprises us, Joel and Ethan Cohen's script satisfies us, and Jack O'Connell shocks us as 'the next big thing.'<br/><br/>Unbroken tells the story of Louie Zamperini, a son to Italian immigrants, who as a kid was a troublemaker and thief. Zamperini's brother pushed him to try out for his school's track team and there we see that Zamperini is a born runner. As the years go by, Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) is recruited for the US Olympic team that would compete the 1936 Berlin games. However, as WWII breaks out, Zamperini is drafted into the army. During a mission in 1943 Zamperini's plane crashes at sea. Zamperini along with the pilot Phil (a great Domhnall Gleeson) and new recruit Mac (Finn Wittrock) are left at sea for 47 days. The three men spend those days being harrowed by sharks and shot at by occasional Japanese planes. The group is finally rescued, but by a Japanese ship. Zamperini is then subjected to the torture and abuse of a prisoner-of-war camp officer, Watanabe ""The Bird"" (Takamasa Ishihara).<br/><br/>The film is powerful and the performances are noteworthy. Jack O'Connell's charisma not only is reflected in Zamperini's character, but it drives the whole film and keeps the audience glued to their seats. Domhnall Gleeson also surprises us as he defines himself as quick-learning actor. Gleeson started from a miniscule role in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but has progressed and moved into more interesting characters in movies like About Time, Frank, and Calvary. Now in Unbroken he might just break into the B-list acting category, it will be only a matter of time before he breaks into the A-list. However, not all the acting was great. There were some serious casting mistakes in Zamperini's brother both as an adult and as a young boy (Alex Russell and John D'Leo respectively). Both actors have very few lines, but they say them in such a way that it makes them sound extremely cheesy and non-credible. It's a shame because it ruins the scenes of Zamperini's childhood. Meanwhile in the prisoner-of-war camp the actor playing The Bird (Takamasa Ishihara) is a little to exaggerated. Ishihara is actually a Japanese pop star, and not a professional actor, and while his acting is more than acceptable, his passion at times is too much and it throws the movie's balance off, creating a character that is unreasonably evil. When researching the actual person I learned that The Bird tortured his prisoners because he was bipolar and jealous of not becoming an officer having come from a wealthy family where he was used to having everything he wanted. Ishihara doesn't give his character depth, The Bird doesn't end up being human, and this lack of background and reasoning for his cruelty makes the relationship between him and Zamperini seem almost comical.<br/><br/>Finally, in regards to the film's script, while written by two professionals like the Cohen brothers, it seems a little lazy. The lack of depth for some characters and the wispy dialogue throughout is disappointing. However, the ending for the film is what disappointed me most, not the actual factual ending, but the way that it was ended. The final ten minutes seemed extremely rushed, confusing, and outright slothish, not to mention a little cheesy. However, in the end, Jolie's directing choices keep the film respectable and intriguing, which along with O'Connell's incredible acting is enough to cover up the mistakes. Unbroken ends up being the inspiring story it aspired to be."

"TheSquiss","7","1","6","7 January 2015"," A remarkable POW story of survival packaged into a fine Sunday matinée flick.
","Unbroken, Angelina Jolie's second outing as feature director (her third, By the Sea is released later this year) is a rewarding, engaging delve into the remarkable true story of Louis Zamperini; trouble maker, Olympian, airman, prisoner of war, survivor <br/><br/>Growing up on the breadline in Orlean, New York, Zamperini (Jack O'Connell), a son of Italian immigrants seems destined for a life in trouble until, running away from it one day, his talent for speed is discovered. Several years later, with one Olympics under his belt, WWII breaks out and Zamperini finds himself in the Pacific fighting the Japanese. When their aeroplane plunges into the sea, Zamperini and the other airmen battle the ravages of the sea to survive 47 harrowing days only to be rescued and taken to a Japanese POW camp. The camp commander, Corporal Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara), makes it his personal mission to make life both incredibly painful and short for Zamperini but the athlete refuses to be broken.<br/><br/>The trailer for Unbroken was enough to put it on my 'Must See' list but, barely ten minutes in, it had the feel of a Sunday matinée and not a challenging look at the harsh realities of war. It showed every sign of being another insipid, failed attempt to tug at the heartstrings, like last year's disappointing Japanese POW flick, The Railway Man.<br/><br/>My concerns were (mostly) unfounded. Certainly it is sanitized, it pulls the punches and feels a little too gentle far too often. Unbroken has the sense of being directed by a concerned, caring mother rather than a tough, headstrong director. If that is how you approach Unbroken, everything will be good in your world. Jolie has crafted a fine film out of a remarkable story that is not too gritty a viewing experience if you wish to take granddad along or want to give the children an education that is only moderately shocking to the innocent.<br/><br/>Jolie has certainly produced a far more affecting and valuable film than George Lucas did with Red Tails. Her vision is grand and the sets and vistas give Unbroken a dark warmth. There are moments that, even after the event, are easy to pick out as potentially iconic: the scene with Zamperini raising the sleeper above his head, the aerial shot of the POWs bathing and resembling rats in a vast tank of water. Wonderful! <br/><br/>As Unbroken weaves its tale, segueing between times to complete Zamerpini's story, it becomes surprisingly moving at times, more for the horrors it suggests than actually depicts, but that's no bad thing. Andy Dufresne's first rape in The Shawshank Redemption was horrific and Darabont didn't show a thing! <br/><br/>While débutant Ishihara struggles to convince us at times, O'Connell carries the film with a gentle strength. There's nothing here to make one sit bolt upright and pour accolades over him, but his performance suits the overall feel of Unbroken. Perhaps more eye-catching is Domhnall Gleeson's performance as Phil, Zamperini's fellow airman and POW. It is yet another solid entry on a CV that suggests he will be around as long and as effectively as his father, Brendan.<br/><br/>Unbroken remains a 'bunk off work day' film rather than one to devote to a precious evening, but it is still an enjoyable way to remember what people fought for, even if it doesn't trouble the emotions as much as it should.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","This was a hard movie for me to watch as I'm not comfortable with cruelty either in person or in a picture. And this film was all about the harshness, the brutality, the enormous cruelty of the Japanese toward the American prisoners of war. It was also a movie about triumph – and not triumph of any one side in a war because I don't think there ever is a triumphant side, only destroyed and dead people left behind an outdated, barbaric way to solve issues – but about personal strength and triumph in the face enormous adversity, of beyond believe pain and misery, and the ability to go above and beyond all of it. Jolie pulled no punches in showing it all. The casting was spot on, the dialog was believable, the pace of the movie was right...in essence, there was nothing about this movie that wasn't exactly right. If there is any fairness in the world, this film and the people involved in it, both in front of and behind the camera, should be in for a whole lot of awards. Bottom line, if you're looking for a good movie, one you won't soon forget – especially in the knowledge that this is a true story – here is your opportunity. See it, by all means."

The story itself is amazing, and it really makes you wonder if you would have it in you to be as strong as the characters were in this movie or just pray for death instead.<br/><br/>However, the script for Unbroken was very weak, especially if you read the book beforehand. None of the characters grew, transformed, changed or learned anything by the end. Everything was so matter-of-fact. Lots of room for intense dramatic moments, character climaxes and transformations that were left on the editing room floor. A dramatic moment would start to happen, but then it would smash-cut to the next scene or day. Hmmm....<br/><br/>Still, a good effort by director Angelina Jolie."

","As far as movies made into books goes, this one was probably one of the better ones. They did however miss a few things that I would have liked them to pull from the book that they decided to skip. I know that when creating a movie from a book, you just cant fit everything in and with this book you could have easily had a five hour movie. Starting at the beginning I felt they did a good job of showing Louie as a child in the way that he acts and how he butts heads with the law and the other kids. I wish they could have developed his family life a little more but I think we got a good sense from his punishment from his father. Another relationship I wish they would have developed more was between him and his brother Pete. Pete was a big part of how Louie was able to get past his rebellious ways and get into something more constructive. Moving on to the next section of the movie when Louie was in the Armed Forces and again I thought they missed out on a big relationship that was relevant with Phil. Phil and Louie were more than friends, they were brothers and the movie really made Phil just seem like a pilot. I wish they would have shown how bad the Green Hornet really was. Phil made a comment about it in the movie how it was a ""parts plane"" but that plane was really a piece of junk and it would have been cool so see a quick walk through of the plane before they got on it. Overall the ocean scene was good, a good showing of the depreciation of the human spirit and the efforts to try and renew it. The biggest pet peeve I had with this movie was in the character of Mutsuhiro (Matsuhiro) Watanabe or The Bird. The movie missed a huge opportunity to show how crazy this man really was. They showed a sliver of his true brutality and almost nothing of his mental issues. This man was crazy, he would invite prisoners into his office for tea and would talk books with them and then something would flip in the Bird's head and he would beat the prisoner senseless, then the next day he would apologize to the man. The Bird was just shown in the movie as the bad guy in the movie but they missed on how much of a bad person he really was. Another thing about the Bird that they could have done better on was how much he worked to break Louie's spirit. They did well with the first scene with the two of them but it really seemed to peak there. The last big negative I have about this movie was the scene with the beam. The movie made this scene the climax of the movie and used it as a symbol for defeating the Japanese. We see the emotions on the Birds face and he seems to be defeated when Louie does not fail right away. From what I have read, the Bird did not take this as a personal defeat as the movie showed. Other than those few negatives, I thought this was a well done movie! Another great American war hero gets to has his story told for all the world to hear!"

","I am not a big fan of these types of films honestly. I don't care about war time films like ""Fury"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"" that doesn't mean there not good films at all there just not my cup of tea. However Unbroken had a lot of good reception around it, so I decided to go and see it and I am happy I did. <br/><br/>The film starts of very slow and even drags its feet in the mud, but when the conflict really starts happening and the characters face many problems that would happen in WWII the film takes a interesting turn and becomes a movie that I really can stand behind and have a bit of enjoyment from. <br/><br/>Will it be in my best films of all time... No?? But it is a good film all the same. It talks a lot on the overall endurance that people have to stand up for what they believe in at all times, and it is quite amazing to see all the hardships these characters go through in order to survive in the face of death and never break for even a moment. I do think that this a good movie to watch. <br/><br/>Now I can't talk about a movie that takes place in WW2 without talking about how Japanese films on it differ from this one. While watching the film I found myself thinking back to ""Grave of the fireflies"" which is a Japanese orientated anime film on WW2 that talks of the sorrow the japs felt as America came back to throw bombs on them, and all there sorrow on the issue. It kinda makes me think as a look at this film were the pain stops. Which is why I liked how the main character was able to see beyond the pain he was feeling towards them, and forgive them for what they had did to him for all that time. <br/><br/>Making this a film that is also about forgiveness in the face of hardships."

Ever. <br/><br/>However, Jolie seems to have got the period settings right, and the way she films scenes of harrowing action, thrill and abuse, it surely seems the work of a seasoned veteran, so she definitely has learnt from a few/all of her directors. <br/><br/>However, this one compares poorly with other works of it's ilk, esp. 'Letters from Iwo Jima' (coincidentally, Eastwood, who helmed that, directed Jolie in 'Changeling', which was underrated and poorly received, and did not deserve the hate that came its way) and the like, and that does not work to its advantage at all.<br/><br/>The new finds, in terms of its leads, also portray their roles like seasoned performers, but it's not enough to set this work of art apart from many that have come before.<br/><br/>What was disappointing to me, mostly, was the oft-repeated use of wartime clichés, with this hopping genres from a period sports drama to a survivors' tale and then a POW camp drama, and while that is addressed seamlessly in terms of transition, most of it seems to have been done for effect, and there is no avoiding the clichés inherent in each of those genres. It would have been prudent, IMO, to have avoided those altogether and see how that played. <br/><br/>The good parts? The amazing action-sequences, that place us in the middle of it all. The unobtrusive/unintrusive CGI. The makeup. The performances, that do not have the necessary solid characterization to build from. The cinematography - Roger Deakins (to be fair though, this is far from his best work, and nevertheless, I'm calling it out in a complimentary fashion). A few themes in the background score, esp. at the beginning.<br/><br/>As far as pacing goes, while it is decently paced, and unhurried (IMO, that is how a movie should be paced), it still could have been trimmed by not having those oft-repeated genre-specific clichés that call attention to themselves, esp. to a seasoned movie-watcher.<br/><br/>Conclusively, while this has got a lot going for it, it still doesn't have that vital something that would set it apart.

","Other reviewers have been very eloquent and specific in their reviews and I cannot match their perceptiveness but I have to leave some review to state how disappointed I was with this very poor film which could have been a cinema classic if the book had been adapted in a better way.
This film will have huge appeal for sadomasochists as a great proportion of it was taken up with men being hit with a stick and punched in the the face, suffering unspeakable punishments and terrible hardships.
I feel embarrassed if this was an attempt by Jolie to show that women could make as good a movie as men, book by a woman, directed/produced by a woman, and casting director. It's ironic that Jolie seems to have targeted this directly at Academy awards looking for a big scoop yet the only Oscar nominations went to men and Alliance of Women Film Journalists nominated it for Movie You Wanted to Love, But Just Couldn't. There are great female directors but this wasn't one to remember. The book by all accounts is a massive best-seller and Laura's two non-fiction books, this one and Sea Biscuit, have sold over 10 million copies and Unbroken has 28,000 reviews on Amazon almost all 5 stars whereas this film averages just over 50% on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes.
I can only imagine the Coen brothers must be mortified to be involved with this film as the screenplay was truly dreadful and I suspect the brothers put their name to it and took a cheque. The film did make money as I think the box office went well off the back off big names, a great story and book, and massive PR and marketing.
I love gritty war films, tales of great human endeavour, strength and courage, guts and determination, athletics, triumph over adversity, true story - this book had it all, the film had all the potential ingredients of a historic top 100 greatest films of all time in the genre of The great escape, Forrest Gump, Castaway, Hacksaw Ridge, Shawshank, Green mile, Saving private Ryan, but Jolie ruined it and she churned out a TV 'B' movie which dragged on and on and an inspirational life story was turned into a monotonous bland documentary with lots of gratuitous violence.
Yes we get it the Japanese prison warden was a cruel evil man but the story had more to offer than an hour of beatings and blood. The book reported that Watanabe stated the prisoners were 'enemies of Japan' so the film reiterated this mantra ad nauseam. These men were confined in close quarters together for months on end in awful conditions, in a liferaft, in various prisons and camps and yet there was nothing but the briefest, unemotional dialogues of the ""pass me the salt old boy"" type. There was no character development or relationships and bonds. Staring at photos of loved ones with a glycerine tear running down the cheek is a very poor substitute for great dialogue and acting and makes for a low-quality film. The hair and makeup was a joke as a nobody grew a beard after a month in a liferaft or in remote prison cells. None of the men outside of the main stars got any dialogue and just moped around looking dirty and glum and then when forced to punch our hero in the face they hit him as hard as they possibly could then moped away again. The important scenes of drama and emotion were very poor and the whole film really felt like a docu-drama as opposed to making a great story into a great film. The casting was poor as the main characters were picked for looks and the ability to look skinny when starved rather than any acting ability, in particular Watanabe was especially weak and lacking substance.
If you want some great Japanese war acting go watch Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence and Bridge of the river Kwai and for athletics and war what about Chariots of fire, for bombers what about Dam busters and Memphis Belle.
What a wasted opportunity to make an all-time classic, I only hope a talented, experienced director gets to do a remake one day.
Truly the best part of this film was the beautiful track 'Miracles' by Coldplay but unfortunately you had to wait until the credits rolled to hear it!"

","""Unbroken"" tells quietly one of the most remarkable stories ever. Louis Zamperini was a heroic individual that this film does not pay tribute to. It's forgettable and generic. Angelina Jolie's direction is just awful, I would have taken any other director to do this film than her. The meaning of Zamperini's legacy is brushed over repeatedly, thanks to Jolie's contributions. The film's premise is meant to be inspiring, but strays way far from it. For the positives, though few, it's shot beautifully, and the acting benefits the film. Like ""Free State of Jones"", I'm delighted that the film exists, but it could have been so much better just like the latter film. ""Unbroken"" is damp compared to the ground-breaking book, as it numerously repeats itself hoping that the audience will forget the meaning of the scenes are constantly matched, which qualifies for it to be tedious."

","UNBROKEN is a WW2 movie that once again has the hook of being based on a true story. This one's about an Olympic runner who becomes a bomber pilot and who ends up in a life raft in the middle of the Pacific after his plane develops a mechanical fault. This occupies the first half of the running time; the second half moves into prisoner of war territory. This film received a lot of attention for being directed by Angelina Jolie, but it feels very much like she's copying Clint Eastwood's style; he, of course, directed her in CHANGELING, so it's a basic imitation more than anything else.<br/><br/>Sadly, Jolie makes some novice mistakes here; the story goes on far too long at times, and ends up being full of sappy, cheesy stuff at the climax, stuff that had me wincing in embarrassment; it was so gritty earlier on, too. Jack O'Connell gives a fine performance as the lead, but this does feel too derivative of the likes of LIFE OF PI and in particular MERRY Christmas, MR. LAWRENCE."

","I had heard about this wartime movie during the time it was in cinemas, I already wanted to see it because of its inclusion during awards season, but then more so when I realised it was directed by actress Angelina Jilie, and written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, No Country for Old Men, Inside Llewyn Davis, Bridge of Spies). Basically Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) is an Italian-American young man from Torrance, California, in his childhood he was a troublemaker, and often picked on by other kids for being of Italian ethnicity. But Louie grows up more disciplined, becoming an accomplished distance runner, earning him the nickname ""The Torrance Tornado"", qualifying for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, coming 8th in the 5,000 meters race, and setting a record for speed in the final lap. Then Louie joins the armed forces in World War II, becoming a bombardier of a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator bomber, during a bombing mission against the Japanese-held island of Nauru, the plane is badly damaged in combat and crashes in the ocean. Louie survives, alongside Russell ""Phil"" Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson) and Francis ""Mac"" McNamara (Finn Wittrock), they live on two rafts, over the next few days they survive on the remaining rations until they run out, then on fish and rain water. On the 27th day, they get the attention of a passing Japanese plane, but it flies over and fires at them, damaging the rafts but missing them, Mac dies 6 days later of exhaustion, and finally on the 47th day, they are found by Japanese sailors. Louie and Phil are captured and become prisoners of war, taken to Kwajalein Atoll and kept in a dungeon, Louie finds out nine U.S. Marines have been held captive on the island, all have been beheaded. One day later, the Japanese ask Louie and Phil to tell them about E-class bombers and the Norden bomb sight, Louie states they flew D-class, on another day they are dragged, disrobed and kneel on planks, they believe it is their execution, the two are shocked that they are crudely washed to be shipped to mainland Japan, but they are separated and sent to different POW camps. Louie's camp, Ōmori, in Tokyo, is headed by Japanese corporal Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara, aka Miyavi), he treats Louie cruelly, being a former Olympian and an American officer. Louie escapes torture when two Japanese newsmen give him the opportunity to broadcast a message home saying that he is alive, but he refuses to broadcast a second message with anti-American propaganda, so back at the camp Watanabe has each other prisoners punch him to teach him respect. Two years later Watanabe is promoted and leaves the camp, American forces bomb Tokyo and the camp is damaged, Louie and the other internees are forced to move to Naoetsu prison camp, Louie is horrified to find Watanabe in charge, he continues to suffer exhaustion and beatings. At the end of the war, Louie and the other prisoners in the camp are set free to return to their homes, Louie wanting to find Watanabe realises he has fled, back home in America, Louie kisses the ground and hugs his family. At the end of the film, a slideshow shows what happened to the real Louie Zamperini, he was married with two children, Phil survived and want on to marry his childhood sweetheart, Watanabe went into hiding for several years and evaded prosecution despite being listed in the top 40 most-wanted Japanese war criminals, and Louie lived out his devotion to God, forgiving his war-time captors and meeting many of them, Watanabe however refused to meet him. In 1998, Louie relived his time as a Olympian, running a leg of the Olympic Torch relay for the Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, four days before his 81st birthday, he died aged 97 on 2nd July 2014. Also starring Garrett Hedlund as LCDR John Fitzgerald, Jai Courtney as Charlton Hugh ""Cup"" Cupernell, Maddalena Ischiale as Louise Zamperini, Vincenzo Amato as Anthony and Luke Treadaway as Miller. It is a pretty amazing story, self- proclaimed regular guy, who competed in the Olympics, survived 47 days of exhaustion and starvation at sea, capture and torture, and being singled out for special punishment in POW camps, Jolie directs conventionally, but really draws you in with the visceral scenes of struggle, balanced with some lighter moments, a most interesting wartime drama based on a true story. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. Very good!"

There are many epic and well-produced battle scenes and Olympic settings yet leaves the viewer with a mix of bland and good emotions. Perhaps a lack any true surprises; you could see the plot arcs.

","It is rare that I stop watching a film part way through, very rare. I like to give all films a proper look but this one was so very bad I could not face any more clichéd scenes. Just to let you know I stopped when Jack O'Connell's shouted at his fellow prisoners to hit him. I suppose it may have happened that way but Japanese POW's were by and large treated appallingly and usually starved so seeing well fed POW's doing this stretched credulity too far yet again, hence the switch off. For yet more unbelievable scenes see the (1) catching, killing, and eating a seabird & then vomiting (2) catching a shark and punching it to death (3) patching the shot up life raft and the shark attack – all too ridiculous for words and so predictable. However, the worst thing about this film was its incredibly boring plot line. Louis Zamperini would probably be spinning in his grave over this turkey of a film. Take my advice avoid if you can."

","Unbroken is a movie directed by Angelina Jolie. It's based on the novel Unbroken, written by Laura Hillenbrand. This novel is about the trials, and adversity in the life of Louis Zamperini, a POW during World War II. The movie as well focuses on Louis Zamperini's journey, what he went through, and his story. The movie begins with Louis in a plane with a few other men. While in the plane there are periodic flashbacks giving the viewer insight into Louis life before the war. These scenes are helpful, giving the viewer a taste of the overall picture. However they can be quite confusing, switching back and forth from past to present. Once the plane has landed the movie goes onto explain Louis' childhood, his relationship with his family, and his childhood struggles. After learning about Louis life and family the movie goes into the overall story of his experience during World War II. As a whole, the movie reflected the book quite well. The characters and structure were pretty much identical. One of the differences between the two, is that the book begins with Louis' childhood and works its way up to the war, while the movie jumps between past and present, before getting into the larger part of the story. Another difference in the book is that when the story is coming to an end, there is much more talk of his family, and what happens in his life after the war. The movie did not cover this as well. The movie ends with a few pictures of Louis family and friends but nothing is really mentioned in detail about his life after the story. This movie is a very inspirational, true story of survival under the worst conditions imaginable. Louis' story really makes the viewers, and readers realize that life for us is not all that hard. This movie is very well executed and is very engaging to anyone who views it."

","This is a film that delves into the life of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini as American athlete and a hero. The first half of the movie is basically flashbacks of Zamperini's childhood and his will power to overcome and become a really good track runner. And how he gets involved in WW2 as a soldier and how his group tries to survive when their plane gets shot down. I personally think they could have done a better job of developing Zamperini, instead of just showing him mostly getting tortured all the way through. But I admired the guy's integrity for standing up for what is right even if he had to give up his comfort and safety to do so. I found that super admirable, especially since this film is based on a true story. And maybe because after watching ""The Circle"" this film was a more inspiring watch. The second character that is sort of developed is a Japanese named Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Who is driven by his own ignorance and arrogance, the guy is a sociopath that has zero empathy. The guy has no honor or integrity and even at a very old age, he decided to die with his ignorance and stupidity intact. The guy is basically a disgrace to the human race and should be forgotten but only remembered for what people should stray away from becoming. I personally thought the film had a good message of pushing forward and not giving up the fight. But a bit more development and substance to the plot would have made this one really stand out for a POW film. I personally think Mrs. Jolie did a fine job with this film.

","""Unbroken"" is a story about Louis Zamperini that seems to have little interest in Louis Zamperini. As quoted by NYtimes ""The film painstakingly details his harrowing wartime experience and every brutal assault against his person"". Angelina Jolie, directed an average film based on Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling book ""Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption"". Unbroken kicks off with a bang. A gorgeous air battle places the audience in the middle of World War II, not caring to introduce you to the boys in the B-24 bomber. From there, the film unfolds as flashback of Zamperini's Torrance, California, childhood and his unlikely ascent to athletic greatness. There in we see a very young Zamperini smoking, drinking, looking up girls' skirts and not paying attention at church. But his brother pushes him to focus, and soon enough, his family realizes they've got a star on their hands. Zamperini, before enlisting in the Air Force to fight in the war, was a track star who ran in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Though fairly straightforward, his racing scenes are among the utmost excitement the viewers can get from the movie. He's a guy who saves his best for the final moments. It's thrilling but immediate which kills the mood. The wartime ""present,"" however, has the feel of a lengthy montage, especially when Zamperini and his fellow mates are stranded after their plane crashes in the Pacific. He and two crew mates survived on a raft at sea for 47 days, only to be captured by the Japanese and put into a brutal prisoner-of-war camp. When he gets to the POW camp, we're introduced to a sadistic prison guard whose sole purpose seems to be to beat Zamperini at every possible moment. But again, without any inquiry into what inspired Zamperini to endure, the endless brutality falls flat. O'Connell's performance is strong and steadfast with moments of greatness and deep vulnerability, but it fails to inspire an emotional response from the audience although certain scenes in the movie were electrifying while other could bore you to death or inspire you depending on your taste."
"MattyAndAnnika","7","0","1","10 August 2015"," good film but......
","Unbroken (2014) is a fairly good war - drama based on the life of Louis Zamperini. I've heard so much about how great this movie was and every time I was told this I went to watch the movie and something just kept me from doing it. I did finally watch this movie and I'm still rather unsure my full feelings on it based on what I was told about it before seeing it for myself; but I'll do my best without spoiling it. I have to give a ton of credit to Angelina Jolie for doing a great job directing as well as being one of the producers on this film. The story was fairly well played out and the acting well.... that's a different story. In the beginning of the movie I do believe that someone could've got a better make-up department as a lot of the makeup on the main characters were so much over done that they stuck out like a sour thumb, and the younger actors portraying ""Louis"" well they weren't so good in the acting department. Other than those two items for the most part the movie was pretty well stable the rest of the way through.<br/><br/>Now as I was saying about the film not being what I was told by everyone well that is certain. The part that has me wondering after watching this is that they're thousands and thousands of war heroes who went through similar if not worse experiences that made it home from the war; ""Should they all have movies too""? I guess my confusion in this story is where does ""Louis Zamperini"" differ from most all other war vets? Other than that the movie was pretty good, and told a very fair story."

","""Unbroken"", a movie by Angelina Jolie strides the religious controversies. Though, according to the experts the movie could not earn was expected, because of the crossfire Angelina was facing due to the Sony hack scandal. Watching the movie, has made it pretty much clear to me that the movie has brilliant cinematography by the experts of the industry. The story revolves around an Italian- American who belongs to a poor background. The boy shows up competing as a runner in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, later on he spends few years as a prisoner of World War II. The participation in the Olympics gives the young boy, a sense of respect and responsibility along with a purpose to live. This sensibility leads to his participation in the army. The story of the movie shows a major and dramatic turn when the young man has a plane crash and has to spend more than 40 days in the sea. The rest of the story revolves around the struggle for survival in the sea. The story continues how Zamperini is beaten by his captain, but he remains ""UNBROKEN"". However, the bad and the most disappointing part of the movie is that Angelina has not been successful in presenting a bigger perspective of the picture. The movie can be counted highly one dimensional just because of the brilliant performance of O'Connell. The entire story of the movie revolves around the struggle of a single person. Though the direction of Angelina gave the movie a highly oppressive strength, even then, the movie lacks a sense of humor as well as refinement as that could be helpful in presenting other aspects of the character of Zamperini."
"ahegde3149","5","0","1","2 July 2015"," Emotionally inspiring but misses the mark
","Unbroken is an inspiring biopic of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini whose wartime experience during WWII is a story worth telling. Technically the film was strong with solid cinematography and seamless use of CGI. The same is not true with the screenplay though. It fails to provide enough character depth and development so that we could completely feel their motivation. We get to see the different events in Zamperini's life but they felt discontinuous and the swapping between his childhood life didn't work well. Also it needed better and more season actors. I am not saying Jack O'Connell or Domhnall Gleeson were not good, but they lacked the impact. There were still many good things in the film, the starting aerial sequence was amazing, the survival at ocean was good but bit too dragged and same can said about the Japanese prison camp. That is the problem, the film simply drags on with its torture at the prison rather. The ending part of the story which is displayed in credits was much more interesting and deserved screen time. The soundtrack was elevating and camera work was great. Unbroken gave me mixed feelings, but I would suggest to watch it solely for unbroken Louis Zamperini. His story is truly inspirational. If you can take it, you can make it.<br/><br/>RATING: [2.5/5]"
"s3276169","6","0","2","1 July 2015"," Falls short of the mark...
","The story of the remarkable life of Louis Zamperini as treated in Helen Hillenbrand's book Unbroken has been adapted to the screen in this film which shares the same name. <br/><br/>Lamentably whilst this film has many of the trapping of expensive Hollywood productions, it lacks the most vital ingredient, a soul. We get to know very little about the Louis Zamperini, the man. Instead, what we are offered is a larger than life caricature, that focuses on Zamperini's Olympic achievements and his courage when faced with abuse at the hands of the Japanese as a prisoner of war. <br/><br/>What also irritated me about this production, was the attempt to humanize and by extension reform Zamperini's abuser, Mutsuhiro Watanabe. A man occupying US authorities, not unreasonably, classified a war criminal. This film does not show the true extent of Watanabe's abuses (which perhaps is not surprising) but nonetheless showing him in a photo as a boy with his father in no way detracts from or excuses what he did to defenseless, weakened men. <br/><br/>All in all, for me, this film falls short of the mark. Its not dreadful but it would have benefited greatly from taking more time to let us get to know the not just Zamperini but the other men who served alongside him. Six out of ten from me."

","I'll start off by saying how much I hate war movies. I can't stand them. Jack O'Connell is my all time favorite actor so I thought of watching this movie but was still unsure. I didn't want to spend hours watching a war movie. We ended up watching the movie in my history class. I loved it. The acting was incredible (Which I knew would be) and the story was touching. I felt many emotions during this movie. I even watched it twice. Keep in mind that this is a true story when you watch it. People actually lived all of this.

","""Unbroken"" is probably one of the best films Angelina Jolie produced and directed. It shows how Louis Zamperini's (Jack O'Connell) strong will to win and survive carries him through the toughest punishments of his military life. I read a lot of negative reviews on this film saying it lacked emotion, feeling, and no character growth, I admit it wasn't a Steven Spielberg kind of World War II film but it wasn't bad. It probably just needed a little more action to make it a better film but I don't think that's what the writers intended. To me the story line and plot came together to make a pretty decent film. The acting wasn't bad either. The characters were pretty convincing. My favorite character was Watanabe (Miyavi). After dealing with the open sea for 47 days Watanabe (Miyavi) was Louis Zamperini's (Jack O'Connell) next hurdle in surviving the war. These two characters' interactions pretty much made the second half of the film. Like I said, I didn't think it was as bad as some reviewers said it was. My wife doesn't even like these kind of films and she ended up liking it."

","It just wasn't a very exciting film.<br/><br/>It's not that I didn't like it or watch it all the way through, except that by the time the final credits rolled I was at my least emotional point. I didn't care for it. The guy suffered in various ways, through being shot down in a plane and losing most of his mates, being stranded on a raft for 45 days, abused in prison for an extended period of time, and then abused even more in an even worse prison - and then the film ended and we're supposed to feel what, exactly? Elated, by the Coldplay song? I felt flat, that's all. It should have been called 'Misery' by Stephen King.<br/><br/>It's war. Some people get captured, wounded or killed. But above all, it's pretty miserable!<br/><br/>I'm not going to write a long review because I didn't get emotionally hooked into it. It was on a par with any standard POW movie, like Stalag 17 from 1953, for example, but without any of the camaraderie, subtle humour and hope.<br/><br/>It had all the ingredients of a really good film, but wasn't."
"IOBdennis","8","0","1","13 June 2015"," Affecting war drama in the tradition of great war dramas
","I just finished watching ""Unbroken"" on DVD, moved and shaken by the film, primarily due to the captivating performance of Miyavi who comes across as the epitome of evil. Miyavi's performance as ""The Bird"" is restrained but reeks of loathing due to jealousy and there is also the presence of fanatical nationalism contrasted with O'Connell's nationalism. Hey, they were both soldiers, right? Miyavi's ""The Bird"", however, takes it to a personal level and couples it with emotion.O'Connell is believable and, as he should be, one-sidedly heroic. Further, as is frequently the case with heroes and villains, the latter is the more interesting, complicated role. Maybe that's why actors like to play villains and not heroes! So, the latter just may be more challenging by that standard, but that's a whole other story. What I was amazed by was when I came to IMDb and saw the preponderance of negative reviews. I don't like to compare films to their sources. I try to view films independently as films, but I do make the comparisons when I know the source (which in this case I did not) and let it go at that. But what got me was how people reacted to the lack of character development, for example, in this movie. I immediately thought back to all of the WWII films I've seen out of Hollywood, and I think this one is *just like the rest*. Main characters are heroes, and villains are villains. We get very little character development in the WWII classics out of Hollywood that were made throughout the 40s and 50s. Perhaps the only exceptions to this rule, as I see it, are ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and *maybe* ""From Here to Eternity"". There are probably others, but these immediately come to mind. So, as far as ""Unbroken"" is concerned, I thought it was an interesting and entertaining film with a vivid performance by Miyavi and a presentable one by O'Connell."

I had to wait an hour before that happens! The hardships described and depicted in the film are quite horrifying for everyday standards, but not when compared to other similar films, such as ""The Railway Man"". The delivery of the story is quite good though, making the film very touching in the end. The theme of unbroken can be emphasised a bit more, not just in the scene where the athlete lifts a plank.

","This is based upon a true story<br/><br/>We see Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) as a kid doing petty thief things, becoming a track star in school so he wouldn't be picked on for being Italian, being a member of the 1936 Olympics Team as a runner, being a Bombardier in WWII, and being downed by engine failures in a plane that was used for parts for other aircraft, and finally being a POW in a Japanese Prison Camp. <br/><br/>From the title we know he will survive everything and maybe this is why we didn't feel empathy anywhere in his life. We didn't need the Kleenex boxes we thought we might need. The 47-days in the life raft showed the plane survivors as fairly healthy and their skin should have shown more blotches from the sun.<br/><br/>It is when Louis gets to the prison camp in Japan that we see him experiencing brutal pain thru beatings. that are administered by the camp commander, Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara). who the prisoners nickname The Bird. Now where did we see him before? Huh?<br/><br/>Didn't we see him at the 1936 Olympics when the torch was being carried in to the stadium? Didn't Louis look to his right and saw Watanabe who looked to his left and nodded to Louis? Wasn't that him? I thought Watanabe, in the camp, was jealous and took pleasure berating and beating Louis. If that was not him, then why was that nodding scene at the Olympics included in the movie? Why indeed because there was no mention in the statements at the end of the movie acknowledging their somewhat meeting at the Olympics and of Watanabe being in the Olympics. Why indeed?<br/><br/>Oh, you say Louis was remembering that time when he was in the camp. No, he had that memory when he was in the plane and about to crash in to the ocean. This memory was not from the camp, but from the plane. See?<br/><br/>This was not a Hogan's Heroes thing in the camp. We saw no interaction between prisoners and guards. We only saw the confrontations between the Bird and Louis. We didn't see much family love from the family except for his brother who helped guide him to a life free of petty crime.<br/><br/>Again, we did not feel any compassion for Louis although I am sure, in that real life, beatings and other tortures were the hi-lite of the day for the Bird. Perhaps the Director (Angelina Jolie) should have concentrated more on Louis' suffering so that we could have needed that Kleenex. Didn't happen.<br/><br/>Oscar nominations were: Cinematography which was very good; and for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing. <br/><br/>Over all a good movie that should have shown more real-life suffering by Louis Zamperini as that would have made the title more significant. From all accounts I felt that Louis Zampirini should have been awarded a medal for his endurance and loyalty for not bad mouthing the United States when given the opportunity over Japanese radio.<br/><br/>See the statements when the credits run to learn more of what happened to everyone.

","Unbroken was one of the most anticipated films of 2014, not only because it's the first major film directed by Angelina Jolie, but that it's one of the most incredible true stories of triumph survival. I think if I would have seen this film in theaters when it came out and was surrounded with the buzz, I may not have liked it as much as I did. In fact, I think one of the reasons I thought Unbroken was a solid film was because my expectations were significantly lowered after everyone said it wasn't as good as everyone thought. I still don't think it turned out to be as good as everyone thought it would be around this time last year, but it still can be enjoyed.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Louie Zamperini, a former Olympian who is stranded at sea for nearly 50 days, before being captured by the Japanese. The story is absolutely incredible. These are the types of stories that should be legends. Humans aren't supposed to go through this much pain and come out on the other side, but somehow and someway, some people do. Zamperini, who only just passed this past year, has inspired so many people with his will and determination to make it to the finish line (no pun intended). The film honors that, and just about every other extraordinary thing he did during his life. But I think the problem was just the organization of the presentation of those events was the issue in the film. I was enamored with the opening shots of the aircraft and the battle. But then the film immediately calms down and flashes to his childhood. I really liked those scenes, but I don't know that the placement of them in between intense battle scenes and the ensuing crash was the best idea. It slowed the pace down unnecessarily. With that said, the rest of the film doesn't do that and has a consistent pacing from then on out so that was nice to see.<br/><br/>The several (and I mean several) defining moments that Zamperini has throughout the film were cool and shot very well by the legend cinematographer Roger Deakins, but they didn't hit as much as I would have wanted them to. When I think of survival movies, or just movies with unbelievable stories I always think of their defining moments and memorable shots from the film. Braveheart, Gladiator, and Gravity all have those iconic moments, and I just didn't feel that from Unbroken. It's not always a necessity, but the trailers made it seem like their would be. It's a beautiful film with a terrific story that surrounds it, but the execution could have been better. With that said, Jack O'Connell gives a wonderful performance as the lead and is surrounded by a surprisingly gifted cast. There isn't a lot of well known talent, but Gleeson, Hedlund, Courtney, and Ishihara give the film credibility that I thought it would have been lacking. The film is also complimented with a magnetic score by the brilliant Alexandre Desplat who chooses only the right moments to make the music noticeable, and it's really effective.<br/><br/>Zamperini's time in the concentration camp is defined by his relationship with 'The Bird' played by Ishihara, and I really liked that dynamic. I'm not sure how much the film followed the actual events and book, but there's something that happened with that dynamic that felt rushed and too forced. It was something that I didn't think needed to happen, even if it was straight out of the book. So I really enjoyed Unbroken. It has some flaws in screenplay and direction but I don't think the fault lies anywhere in particular, it just wasn't as good as everyone had hoped.<br/><br/>+Magnetic score <br/><br/>+O'Connell <br/><br/>+Incredible story <br/><br/>+Cinematography <br/><br/>-Pacing issues towards the beginning <br/><br/>-Big moments didn't really hit <br/><br/>7.2/10"

I salute you Angie!<br/><br/>The film takes me back to the most tragic events in the history where a lot of people suffered and died. Louis Zamperini was one of them, BUT he survived. Being part of the war was already a painful experience, seeing people fought and died, suffered from agony, it will definitely traumatized a person. But that's only one of his deadly experience. He also stayed floating at the center of the pacific ocean for 47 days and then captured by the Japanese forces. He was punished almost everyday by Lucifer's assistant, Watanabe. I can't imagine a person survived such tragedies, but he is the only exception. He didn't loose HOPE. He didn't quit. There's no doubt that he is a FIGHTER. It brought me to tears when I saw him suffer. But still he stood up on his feet and carry the world with both of his tired hands. I wish I could've met him before he died. I want to hug him and thank him for being an inspiration and for being my HERO. <br/><br/>I want to thank Angelina Jolie for bringing this movie to us.

In only her second directorial effort, Angelina Jolie presents us with her vision of this man's struggle, as the movie will mainly focus on his time during the war, with some initial flashbacks showcasing his trajectory to the Olympics (another important aspect of his life). Overall I felt the dramatic effect of the movie delivered. Jolie's direction highlights feats of inner strenght and resistance as Louis takes everything that is thrown at him. Whilst familiar, the script does adapt well to this individual and personal journey. It features some of the clichÃ©s used in this type of film, yet with some solid acting, it just about pulls it off. I guess I would say that this movie was acceptable in filmmaking terms. With nothing particularly innovative about it, Unbroken succeeds in connecting you with the protagonist, someone who you root for right from the very start, something that the lead actor has a hand in as well. I personally would have liked a more linear plot, but in the end it doesn't take anything away from the movie. It's quite clear that the film's most redeemable quality is its incredible accessible character and if you wanna find out how he survived the ordeal, then I believe you'll enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 7,5-8/10"

In this film, the war is seen like a thing that separate the families. The kind characters are the American and the Japanese are the villains. The American soldiers are strong (physically and psychologically) and they don't give up their aim : win the war to take revenge over the villains. The war is also seen like endless. It's a good film but it's very very violent. Indeed, it's not a film for the children because it represent the violence of the war in the prisoner-of-war camp. Moreover, there are not only one love story and the film is long (more than two hours). But, this is an American film, therefore the Japanese are seen like villains but some Japanese are not cruel as much as the ""Bird"".

The early scenes in which Louis is a juvenile delinquent saved by his brother's encouragement of him to be a runner are simply but movingly portrayed. The scenes in the plane with his air force buddies are incredible. Japanese midget planes, bullets and bombs whiz by from all angles. The guy next to you could be joking with you one moment, and the next shot through the head. The scenes in the life raft are truly gripping, with sharks, storms, the sun and gunfire from a Japanese plane all seemingly determined to kill Louis and his two fellow survivors. The detention camp scenes were very realistically stark and brutal. Uncomfortable viewing, and the Japanese actor playing Louis's sadistic, deluded tormentor 'Bird' is outstanding.

There Louis has to go through challenges to survive while the War is going on.<br/><br/>I believe that the film was put together really well, it made it look really well. That a war was actually going on and the sadness and torture with the prisoners. The Director was Angelina Jolie I think that the actors were great in the movie. It was like they were actually the person and not acting. For Louis, His acting was just perfect and one point, the way he seem like he was in pain and anger. And how skinny he looked. For Watanabe, He was great as the general. It was believable that he was angry and vicious to the prisoners It was understandable because all of that has happened before. People are taken hostage to work. I didn't see the beginning of the movie so I don't know about the flash backs. It looked very realistic, with the mountains, Water, Trees. Everything looked so real in the background. Their Costumes couldn't be any better. They looked like real soldiers, prisoners, and guards. The music made everything all dramatic and sad. So that it went along with the story. It helped to show how much sadness there was in that camp, Also agony and anger. I believe that the movie was just right, the length. Because it shows the time period of when they were captured so you know what they experienced there. I didn't like it how in the movie the guy in the raft wanted to die so they tied him up and he drowned. It also made no sense of how when the raft got shot multiple times that the raft didn't sink all the way. Because there were many bullet holes. Those two men in the raft should've been dead. I wouldn't say 13 and up. Because no little kids should watch this movie, because of the violence and how the men are treated. I would give the movie 4 Stars. The reasoning why is yes it was a great movie but some things in it were questioning."

","The film is set mainly during WWII, based on the life of problem child, turned Olympian turned war hero Louis Zamperini. A real life figure who is portrayed by the relatively unknown (in America anyways) Jack O' Connell. The film starts off well enough, putting us right into the action of Zamperini's war days, with flashbacks to his time as a trouble making kid, and back to the war and back to his time as a track star... and back and forth until the two story lines catch up with each other. The trailers left me with the impression that the bulk of the story would be spent in the Japanese internment camps, it actually took close to an hour to get us there. Although at over a 2 hour running time, the argument could be made, that all that preceded the POW camp was back story, or build up. I do commend the filmmakers for trying to stay as close to real events and timeliness as possible. That being said, the film did feel a bit slow to me at times. Maybe after a second screening I won't feel as off by the pacing knowing when the parts of the story I saw in the trailer were coming. This film is only the second feature from superstar turned filmmaker, Angelina Jolie, with a screenplay by none other than the the famed writer/director siblings, Joel and Ethan Coen. I'm not sure if you've figured this out yet, but I am a big supporter of the female filmmaker. However I did find a few problems with Angelina's directing, that I feel the need to comment on. As I said earlier the pacing of the film seemed a little slow for my taste, but that's something I can get past. The physical scenes, like Zamperini getting beat up as a child, or disciplined by his father fell flat. Instead of utilizing close ups to show pain or emotion, these scenes were left mostly as wide shots, or what I call establishing shots, as if we were just watching what was happening and not experiencing it from Louis point of view. The same goes for the more brutal scenes in the camps. However, the argument could be made that this was done on purpose, to show a more human side to Zamperini's tormentors. Maybe I've become too desensitized by modern filmmaking, but I still feel there could have been a few more cuts to close ups and reaction shots to convey more of a sense of urgency or fear. I do appreciate the overall feel of the movie, Angelina Jolie seems to have a very romantic sense of filmmaking, not unlike Sofia Coppola. Which can be wonderful, but I've had the same pacing issue with some of Coppola's films as I had with this film. That being said the nominations that Unbroken was awarded were well deserved, cinematography and sound mixing and sound editing (though you'd be hard pressed to find a decent war movie that was not nominated for a sound achievement). I just hope that miss Jolie (or Mrs. Jolie-Pitt, whatever she goes by) is aware of the talent of her crew, and appreciates their contribution to the film. that being said, I do feel that Angelina Jolie has talent as a director. The cast was absolutely amazing, and their performances were top notch. It is very obvious that Jolie knows how to direct her actors.<br/><br/>So, when all is said and done, if you go into Unbroken expecting an inspirational story over a war drama, you will not be disappointed. I am excited to see more of Angelina Jolie in this medium as well as the actors and crew."

","The title says for itself. This movie isn't about anything else but how Olympian Louis Zamperini, how he grew up and how he survived the WWII.<br/><br/>Unbroken could have been a great film.<br/><br/>I don't think the story-line is too slow. Instead, I think that the movie is too short. The movie tells us so much about Louis and how he could keep his mind (and his friends's mind) sane during the 47 days in a raft. But after he was picked up by Japanese army, every scene went in a rush. Louis hardly said anything, anything at all. It's a shame because we need to know what he was thinking. We need to learn from him and from every soldier captured in the POW camps. How they won the war by remaining alive. Two-hour just isn't enough. <br/><br/>As for the Bird, we need to know more about him too. His character in the film is too flat. It was hard too comprehend why he did things that he did. Why he said what he said too Louise.<br/><br/>I've known about Miyavi since when he was in the band Dué le Quartz. Although I didn't like his screaming, I thought he was a great guitarist. Seeing him act in this movie was strange but refreshing. His English is good which is good for the film. Except, he pronounced English words so carefully it could sound unnatural and lack of feelings. (Not for me thought. I live in Japan so I am used to Japanese pronouncing English.) I won't blame him for being too pretty or too soft for the role because every young Japanese actor looks girlish. Like Tanroh Ishida in The Railway Man, he even looks younger and more girlish than Miyavi."

","True or mostly true stories about strong people who survived tough circumstances are often catchy to follow, particularly if a person did not get into trouble ""voluntarily"", but due to a certain force majeure. World War II was such a mayhem when staying alive no matter what was the virtually the main thing, other things like broken families/opportunities/careers seemed secondary, if not lower. <br/><br/>Thanks to the Coen Brothers and Angelina Jolie, above all, we are able to follow the childhood and youth of Louie Zamporini, until his return from a Japanese prison camp in 1945. Rough environment and sports made him tough and let him survive so many such events that even 1 one of those could be easily fatal to most of us. But Zamporini landed on his feet and lived 97 years, all in all... The pace is not always dynamic and some scenes are protracted, but the movie in question is generally a smooth narration about the war perceived by single, ""ordinary"" people.<br/><br/>The cast is even in a sense that there are no famous persons stealing the slow. True, Jack O'Connell as Zamperini and Takamasa Ishihara as Mutsuhiro ""The Bird"" Watanabe spend more time on screen than others, with the characters more elaborated, but still, there are no pointless supporting characters among them who say something, they have good complementary significance. Thus, Unbroken is a good watch, but it is still no The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Raid, Empire of the Sun, or similar - no such profundity."
"DareDevilKid","7","0","2","25 January 2015"," Hugely Inspiring but Lacks that Edge
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 3.6/5 stars<br/><br/>War is hell, but few soldiers endured as much purgatory and perdition as Louis Zamperini. As such, his story is a compelling one that shows just how much the human spirit and body can endure. Unfortunately this tale of survival has little else to offer beyond its tale of survival.<br/><br/>Near the beginning of ""Unbroken"" there's an action sequence of astonishing power - an aerial battle - mostly set inside the U.S. aircraft as it outmaneuvers, outwits, and ultimately overpowers rival Japanese aircrafts. This sequence is so well handled that expectations are raised very high that Jolie may have come up with a classic war film. But as the film proceeds, we realize that this is not to be.<br/><br/>In many ways Louis Zamperini's life was a miracle. The wayward son of Italian immigrants, he would go on to find his calling as a long distance runner, and represent America at both the 1936 Olympic Games as well as a bombardier in WWII, where he became a prisoner of war and survived a harrowing ordeal at the hands of the Japanese army. Refusing to have his spirit broken, Zamperini lived out the rest of his days as a dedicated Christian and inspirational speaker until his death a mere 7 months ago.<br/><br/>Flashbacks tell Zamperini's story, from his boyhood as an Italian- American in a Californian backwater (photographed, like most of the movie, in Australia), to his success as a runner at the 1936 Berlin Olympics and his war experiences. After crash-landing into the ocean during a routine mission, he and his surviving mates spend 47 days in a rubber raft before being captured by the Japanese Navy, and enduring the hell of two prisoner-of-war camps.<br/><br/>Just as an inexperienced coach of a big-market team is surrounded by veteran talent to make their job easier, Jolie is flanked by a stellar crew that have helped make ""Unbroken"" one of the better technically crafted films of the year, with special mention to the eternal Roger Deakins' crisp, vivid cinematography, and the excellent work by the film's sound department.<br/><br/>Exceptional too are the performances, especially by Jack O'Connell who caps off an extraordinary breakthrough year (which includes brilliant lead turns in ""Starred Up"" and ""'71"") with an all- encompassing turn as Zamperini, giving body and a palpable, unshakeable strength to a man whose physical and mental torture only invigorated his resolve. As the ill-fated runner/soldier, O'Connell effectively portraying the pain, stoicism and large emotional range the role requires. Another noteworthy performance comes from Ishihara, as the Japanese POW camp commander, Mutsuhiro ""Bird"" Watanabe, who conveys the right amount of repulsiveness - sans any caricatured bits - for us to genuinely loathe him.<br/><br/>Hence, it's certainly no fault of O'Connell's and the supporting cast that we don't get a clear understanding of what made Zamperini tick. That fault lies with the script, which so focused on its events that it forgets to give us much in the way of the story's characters – highly surprising considering the writing talent involved (the Coen brothers, among four writers, drafted the screenplay from Laura Hillenbrand's book. As a result, Zamperini is portrayed as little more than ""the guy that survived"" - we get no sense of what he was like as a man beyond the fact that his spirit was ""unbreakable"", and that he was a fairly decent guy. We are left with no idea about what really drove him and kept him going through such horrific experiences, and even less of an idea about his fellow POWs.<br/><br/>An audience is always going to care more about people if they get to know them, but there is little in the way of introductions or development for these POWs. It's really only the relentless weight of their suffering that allows the film to break through emotionally, and as such it feels like ""Unbroken"" sells its subjects short.<br/><br/>It's hard to fault Jolie's direction too much either. The film takes a little while to get going but moves at a decent pace in its latter half. She also avoids making the necessary violence overtly gratuitous. The problem lies with the script and its ""events, not characters"" approach. Also, the movie is not filled with scintillating dialogue or amazing set pieces - although the opening aerial dog fight is pretty cool and the Olympic sequence is done well - so without character depth to drive the necessary emotional punch we are left with little more beyond an hour of hardship.<br/><br/>I guess if one were to fault Jolie's direction it would have to be in her hurriedness to conclude Zamperini's amazing journey. While she does not flinch in depicting the inhumane, despicable brutality which Zamperini endured, there is too much fixation on the savagery which befell this man, and not enough time dedicated to Zamperini's post- war journey into a strong Christian belief, that saw him eventually forgive the captors that tormented him. There is an entire third act missing from ""Unbroken"" that was needed to bring things full circle. With Jolie's strong bond with Zamperini during his last days, one would think that she would know it wasn't just the dark moments during the war that encapsulated his life, but also the power of grace and forgiveness that drew him from the shadows and into the light.<br/><br/>It's that kind of thing that great filmmakers pick up on and form into great movies. One day Jolie may well get that instinct. She has talent, no doubt about that, and may one day make a really outstanding film. As for ""Unbroken"", the film is certainly worth a look as it's a compelling story, but you will walk away knowing what happened to Zamperini and not who Zamperini really was. Jolie's second directorial stint could be considered as more of a strong learning curve than a grand statement."
"christinethompson9","7","0","1","20 January 2015"," Only Half the Story Told
","I thought Angelina Jolie did a pretty terrific job directing such a tedious plot. Of course she had the best crew, and that helped her achieve a pretty great film. I read the book so I was familiar with Mr. Zamperini's entire story.<br/><br/>However, Jolie only filmed half of Zamperini's story, which made it a downer. <br/><br/>Louis Zamperini's life was indeed HELL after the war ended in Japan, and Louis was released from the POW camps in Japanese territories. Sure, he held it together for almost 3 years while in the camps, struggling with living like an animal, starving to death, living in his own poop and vomit, and enduring the ""Bird's"" daily beatings. I'm glad that the torture was not depicted as gory as it was in the book. Jolie did a good job and we got the gist.<br/><br/>Then when the war ended and Louis went home to California, he became an angry alcoholic. Who wouldn't? He did meet a wonderful woman whom he married. His alcoholism grew, of course. Who could handle the stuff he went through without self medicating? However, he eventually gave his life to God through a famous evangelist crusade in Los Angeles in the 1950s.<br/><br/>Then Louis went back to Japan to personally forgive most of the Japanese commanders who tortured him during the war. He could not find the ""Bird,"" his most sadistic torturer, as the ""Bird"" was fleeing all the time, knowing he was a wanted war criminal. This was all left out of the movie. All we got were written words at the end of the movie, that Zamperini gave his life to God and forgave his torturers.<br/><br/>I realize the difficulty in giving an exact account from book to movie. But I thought Jolie did pretty well. The scenes at the POW camps could have been shortened so that the rest of the story could be told.<br/><br/>The second half of the story is going to be told by a famous Christian organization. Unfortunately, it won't be in big budget movie format. It may just be ""stills"" and not even a movie at all. Maybe someone will come up with the budget so that the rest of this amazing story can be told in movie format."

","With the Oscars coming up, I have been catching up on the films that have been honored with nominations from the Academy. Today I viewed ""Unbroken"" starring Jack O'Connell, Takamasa Ishihara, Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund, Matthew Crocker, and Finn Wittrock (most recently seen on American Horror Story: Freak Show). <br/><br/>The film is a true story about the life of Olympic athlete Louis Zamperini and his time in the armed forces during WWII. It was directed by Angelina Jolie and written by Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese, William Nicholson, and the book the screenplay was based on was written by Laura Hillenbrand. <br/><br/>""Unbroken"" was nominated for Oscars in the following categories:<br/><br/>Best Achievement in Cinematography Best Achievement in Sound Mixing Best Achievement in Sound Editing The film received the honor of Movie of the Year at the AFI Awards.<br/><br/>""Unbroken: also received the following Critics Choice Awards honors:<br/><br/>Best Picture Best Director (Jolie) Best Adapted Screenplay Best Cinematography <br/><br/>There was a bit of controversy over the snubbing of Jolie by the Oscars Academy for Jolie as best director and after viewing the film, I can see why. I do understand why the film garnered much acclaim for cinematography, sound, and screenplay. It was beautifully shot and the perspective of the cameras during the period they were stranded on the lifeboats was absolute perfection. I felt so helpless along with the characters, I felt frustrated for them, and even more than a bit panicked. <br/><br/>From the beginning I found the writing and delivery of the lines to convey the camaraderie of the soldiers. When they receive a new plane to fly, one officer comments, ""It's like sitting in the living room trying to fly the house"" another counters with ""Well, it's been certified"" and another comments, ""By Hellen Keller"". The playfulness quickly turns serious when the plane goes down and only three are left in a most dire situation.<br/><br/>Floating on lifeboats, surrounded by sharks with no food and one injured man is no picnic. The character of Mac (Wittrock) is so negative from the very beginning and I noted that I did agree with him but you have to be practical and try as hard as you can to at least stay positive while trying your best to find a way out. I might feel differently about that if I were in such a situation, to be honest. <br/><br/>At one point the men capture a seagull and try to eat it. The FIRST thing that went through my head was, YUCK! seagulls mostly eat garbage and waste so to eat one raw really wouldn't be my ideal solution for starvation. <br/><br/>Louis Zamperini was an Olympic runner and even during his capture by the Japanese, he remained true to his roots but the conditions were not exactly conducive to his health nor perfect for his athleticism. Most of the time in captivity was a struggle between the Americans' patriotism and their survival instinct. Again, some of the things that happen to them during the time they were being held by the Japanese was hard to watch and definitely stirred feelings of anger. <br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the story but I do want to encourage you to see ""Unbroken"" as well as the other Oscar nominated films, before the Oscars if you can. The movie industry has taken lots of criticism in the past few years but there are still high quality projects, involving truly talented and dedicated people that slip past us each year. I find the Oscars can lead us to these projects by following the nominees and paying attention to the films that generate the most buzz or controversy for being overlooked. Use the nominations to find films to watch but also pay attention to what is being said about those films that many feel deserved to be nominated and weren't. Go see as many as you can, good entertainment keeps us happy and gives us lots to talk about! by Teeco71"
"PWNYCNY","8","0","5","17 January 2015"," It was brutal being a POW under the Japanese.
","The story is about two men: an American prisoner of war, Louis Zamperini, and a Japanese prison guard, Mutihiro Watanabe, who torments him. The movie devotes a lot of time telling the audience about Zamperini but provides almost nothing about Watanabe, thus transforming the latter into a stereotype. Watanabe's violence comes off as gratuitous; why he targets Zamperini in particular is never fully explained, and in order for the story to make sense, an explanation is required. Yet on one point the movie is utterly clear: the brutality of the Japanese in their treatment of the prisoners of war. The sheer mindlessness of the brutality is depicted with candor and frankness. There is no question that in this movie the Japanese are brutal as a matter of policy. It was brutality motivated by sheer hatred. Watanabe hates his prisoners; he hates Zamperini. His hatred is so intense that he cannot put it into words. He can only act on it. That any Americans at all survived incarceration under these circumstances is a miracle. True, Japan and the United States were engaged in a vicious war but still, there was no valid excuse to them to forgo even the pretensions of legality in the treatment of the prisoners. For the Japanese, the prisoners were not only the enemy but were still combatants who just happned to be prisoners. The movie is crammed with violence; everything in this story is violent. Watanabe vents his rage on Zamperini. After he is ""rescued"" by the Japanese, Zamperini becomes a punching bag for the disgruntled Watanabe. What is disturbing is that such scenes are not merely gratuitous depictions of violence meant to intensify the story but are based on historical incidents that actually occurred. Zamperini did not deserve to be mistreated. Why the Japanese chose to take the low road of brutality is never fully answered."

","Angelina Jolie's second effort at directing a feature film is successful, albeit not remarkable or profound, with her story of Louis Zamperini in Unbroken.<br/><br/>The story of Louis Zamperini is one of remarkable perseverance and strength – if only the creative minds behind Unbroken channeled that same diligence into making a successfully impactful film.<br/><br/>Louis Zamperini is an example of the unsung hero and extraordinary American. His story is a moving one that deserves distinction. The tale of Louis Zamperini as told by Unbroken centers around his time as a soldier against Japanese forces during WWII and eventual internment as a prisoner of war. A man of impressive history, the narrative of Unbroken also delves into his childhood, his athletic endeavors as an Olympic runner and the miraculous but harrowing 47 days spent stranded at sea after a near-fatal plane crash.<br/><br/>Unbroken is not a bad film, it is actually a good film but unfortunately it is a film aspiring for greatness and eventual recognition – of which it falls quite short of achieving. As a whole, the cinematic experience from Unbroken is not satisfying. We as a viewer are shown beautiful cinematography from Roger Deakins of astounding events that seem to have no greater significance or implication. A film of this magnitude needs to have a profound a-ha moment of cohesion and relations and Unbroken doesn't have it.<br/><br/>Unbroken suffers from lack of editing from an inability to have a clear ultimate purpose. Equally responsible for this lack of correlation within the narrative is the director Angelina Jolie and screenwriters Joel Coen and Ethan Coen. The Coen brothers write dialogue that is very obviously manufactured to have depth and meaning but is painfully transparent and lacking true poignancy. Unfortunately Jolie is also unable to craft a balance between Zamperini's past and present from her own creative vision.<br/><br/>The most unforgivable aspect of Unbroken is in its creative direction of its conclusion. After a showcase of notable moments within Zamperini's life are seemingly left independent from one another with no eventual unity, Angelina Jolie not only allows the film to have no emotional resolution for the viewer but resorts to lazy snapshots of text to wrap-up the story by telling the audience rather than showing us.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for all the recent releases, reviewed in full."
"joeandnadia","7","0","2","13 January 2015"," Well-done, but no plot
","""Unbroken"" is a well-done movie, but I expected much more of a plot. During the movie, circumstance after circumstance affects the main character, Louis Zamperini, and he endures each of them until the end. Indeed, the theme of the movie is the title - that Zamperini, an American prisoner of war, remained steadfast – or, unbroken - in his ability to withstand the punishment of his Japanese captors. Over and over we see him treated horribly until the end of the movie. Not only is this difficult to watch, but there is little advance of any story. I was hoping to see much more of his running career, more of his family's response to his captivity, and more of his later life. The movie does summarize at the very end the final years of his life and his friends' lives, but it would have been more enjoyable to me to see it performed on screen. I do think that the main intent of the script writer and the director was to demonstrate Zamperini's high integrity and his ability to endure these terrible difficulties as opposed to dramatizing his whole life, but that makes a weak story in my opinion. If you like a movie that simply shows a strong character in the throes of battle, you will enjoy ""Unbroken."" It is true that we never stop cheering for Zamperini, but it can be hard to watch. I am giving this movie a 7 because I believe that what Angelina Jolie did with the script and the character of the man was well executed, but I was hoping for much more."

There was many times where I said to myself ""How the hell did there get that shot"", I know they used CG for some parts but for the parts that they didn't was CG was truly Oscar worthy Cinematography. <br/><br/>Jack O'Connell is a true rising star so far in his career. In this movie he deliverers a fantastic and heart hitting performance and I like the fact that he showed all the pain, sadness and tiredness in his eyes in this movie, that made me feel sorry for this guy. Jack O'Connell played Louis Zamperinin so terrifically well that I wonder what else he's doing next after this because I what to see this guy in other films.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about Angelina Jolie taking the directors chair. I know for a fact that Jolie had full respect for Louis. I sawed it photos and interviews, how she looked up to this man has her inspiration, and she directed this movie pretty good if I must say. She didn't directed this movie in a way that it feels to much like a Hollywood cash grab, no I can look at this movie and call it a war film and that's that. Unbroken to me might be a step up from Jolie directing career. I would love to see more from her directing skills and I bet she got a lot of hate and that must be really hard for her, but Louis Zamperinin once said ""Never give up. No matter what"".<br/><br/>Now for the problems: Louis Zamperinin is a inspiring person who has been through hell most of his life and the fact that this guy kept going is truly remarkable, but in this movie he was just came off as a tough son of a b*tch and not really inspiring in a way that Louis was. The Prison camp in this movie wasn't really all that effective at all. Japanese prison in real life back then was a lot brutal and effectively shocking, but in this it wasn't and it would be more powerful if Louis stood out from the rest and became a leader to those jailed soldiers. <br/><br/>Overall Unbroken may have a lot of problems with it's pasting and slow scenes, but the movie has good directing, terrific performance from Jack O'Connell and beautifully Cinematography."
