"BlackX","8","49","61","19 December 2003"," What if God was one of us? It would be pretty funny.
","I really do not know what people have against this film, but it's definitely one of my favourites. It's not preachy, it's not anchored by it's moral, it shouldn't be controversial. It's just God. Any possible God, no matter the religion. And it's really funny.<br/><br/>Jim Carry plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter usually stuck on the lighter side of the news, desperate to prove himself (more or less TO himself) that he can be taken seriously and do a good job in an anchor job. This drive is what is slowly driving his beautiful girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) away. When the final straws are executed, he's quick to not laugh, but yell in the face of God, who in turn gives Bruce his powers. Bruce then makes his life better for himself, until he's guilted into helping others, where he then continues to miss the point of his powers. Meanwhile, his constant excitement about his own life makes him more selfish, leaving his relationship on dangerous ground.<br/><br/>OK, that was kinda long. But as a plot, it works well. The step-by-step fashion in which we meet the challenges of being God is much better than clustering his problems together, and is able to hide itself fairly well.<br/><br/>As you probably know from hearing about this movie in the first place, Carrey's pitch-perfect acting stays in character (which, luckily enough, is him), and controls and gives atmosphere to the movie scene by scene. Whether they would admit it or not, the role was written or rewritten exclusively for Carrey. Without him, the humour would turn flat, as humour is half execution. And the humour is very good in the first place. But without Carrey, it would kinda feel like a It's a Wonderful Life wannabe.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston is great and, no matter what some may say, does not act like the only excuse for the third act. At least, you don't think that when you see her. She gives a heartfelt performance and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she and Carrey feel very much like a real couple.<br/><br/>The movie feels ggooooodd (see the movie to understand), has a very nice feeling, tackles the idea appropriately and better than expected and overall should never have been called slapped together just to save Carrey's career (which wasn't goin' anywhere.)."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","128","177","9 July 2003"," Wait, you mean all I have to do is become God to solve all my problems? Why didn't I think of that before???
","Jim Carrey is back to much the same role that he played in The Mask, a timid guy who is trying to get ahead in the world but who seems to be plagued with bad luck. Even when he tries to help a homeless guy from being harassed by a bunch of hoodlums (and of course they have to be Mexican, obviously), his good will towards his fellow man backfires. In that case, it wasn't too hard to predict that he was about to have a handful of angry hoodlums, but I like that the movie suggests that  things like that shouldn't be ignored. I'm reminded of the episode of Michael Moore's brilliant The Awful Truth, when they had a man lay down on the sidewalk and pretend to be dead and see who would actually stop and make sure he was okay. The results were not very promising, so it's nice to see someone in the movies setting a good example.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays the part of Bruce Nolan, the nice guy mentioned above whose entire life seems to be falling apart. Or even better, it seems to be breaking up by the blows of bad luck like an asteroid entering the atmosphere (a little metaphor that comes up when Bruce miraculously finds himself a gigantic news story later in the film). Bruce is nearly 40 years old and all he has to show for it is a position as a news reporter of the sort that reports on such exciting news as the local bakery that's seeking to bake the world's biggest cookie. He's desperate to obtain the job of head anchor at the TV station, but he loses his cool on live TV when he hears that the job went to his rival colleague. You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report. Needless to say, he loses his temper on live TV in one of the funniest scenes of the entire film.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman delivers a fantastic performance as the Man himself, displaying a God whose infinite wisdom is somewhat reflected through Freeman's massive talent as an actor. He is the kind of God who takes his job very seriously, but in such a way as to advise his followers (as well as the viewers of this movie) that there are times when you need to slow down and do some manual labor in life. I love his line that some of the happiest people in the world come home smelling to high heaven at the end of the day. There are a lot of people in the world (maybe more than our share in America) who are so absorbed by their money and their possessions and their jobs and everything that they completely lost touch with the natural side of themselves as humans.<br/><br/>One of the biggest strengths is that the movie is able to provide great advice to people in general about improving their lives, and this message is clear and acceptable regardless of the viewer's religion. I, for example, tend to reject organized religion in all forms and I see God and Satan to be metaphors for different aspects of nature and human psychology rather than actual figures who ever lived or continue to live. But despite the fact that I don't believe that God exists as an entity overseeing the universe or as a janitor dressed all in white who mops the floors of his downtown office in his spare time, I was able to appreciate the messages that were delivered in this movie.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's movies display this fantastic evolution that ties them all together and makes the newer ones look even better just because you can see how far he's come. If you compare Bruce Almighty with movies like Ace Ventura (both of which I loved, by the way) or a lot of what he did before he got into film, it's amazing how far he's come. He has moved from cheesy TV comedy to cheesy comedic films to comedies that are truly intelligent and meaningful like this film as well as others like The Truman Show, Man on the Moon, and The Majestic (easily one of his greatest films ever). Jim Carrey has unmistakably moved from the cheesy comedy of his past to become one of the most important comic actors working today.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston also once again provides an excellent addition to the movie (as she did in the side-splitting Office Space) as Bruce's girlfriend, who becomes increasingly exasperated by Bruce's growing stress about his life as well as his negligence to ask her to marry him. There is definitely some low-brow comedy in the film that doesn't really fit with the importance of the film's meaning or the quality of the delivery, such as the dog reading the newspaper on the toilet and the whole monkey scene, but it was definitely pretty nice to see Ace Ventura's friend Spike make a cameo appearance. As Stephen King very well knows, it's always nice to see familiar characters. It's almost like seeing family again.<br/><br/>
Bruce is endowed with the powers of God for a given period of time so that he can understand life a bit better, and he says a lot about himself when he uses the powers only for his own purposes rather than to help all of the people who pray to him. The thing I love about this is that, like I said before, religion is absent from my life, but I was able to watch this and learn a lot about myself as well by thinking about what kinds of things I would have done had I been endowed with such powers. The movie allows us to learn vicariously this way, which empowers the message even more.<br/><br/>
The scenes that involve the news station are easily the funniest in the entire film, such as the scene when Bruce loses his temper about the anchor position, the Jimmy Hoffa scene (who was conveniently buried with an original birth certificate and a complete set of dental records), the scene where Bruce's rival colleague is made to go nuts on camera, and my favorites, the ones at the beginning and the end involving the local bakery's cooking. The movie has plenty of time for Carrey to deliver some excellent jokes, such as when he says to God (who reveals that he's the janitor, the proprietor, the electrician, etc) that his Christmas parties must be real bashes, and to be careful about drinking, because on of him might need a ride home! I also loved the end when he says that behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. A little too true, and as Gallagher would add, behind every great man is also an amazed mother-in-law.<br/><br/>
Bruce Almighty is one of the more memorable comedies to have come out for quite a while, and is probably the only directly religious that I can remember seeing that I am anxious to buy on DVD to add to my personal collection. It is a comedy written and performed in good taste, but with enough relatively low-brow humor to keep the kids entertained. This is a meaningful comedy for the whole family, which is becoming rarer and rarer these days. In a world that is about to be flogged with yet another American Pie film AND another Scary Movie (which are only scary because of their sheer barbarous idiocy), it's nice to see that there are still people making comedies worth watching. Don't miss this one."
"schmimic","9","91","124","23 April 2005"," Jim Carrey delivers his trademark antics in this little comedy gem about the responsibility of playing God.
","Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore.<br/><br/>Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low down.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.<br/><br/>Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.<br/><br/>Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.<br/><br/>Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's.<br/><br/>Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.<br/><br/>So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)"
"joe-elliott2","7","10","11","5 November 2008"," Averages out to be pretty good
","Bruce Almighty is the story of Bruce Nolan, an average man who feels God is messing up his life. God confronts him and show Bruce the error of his ways. Of course, giving someone God's powers could take a turn for the worse. Bruce Almighty is a good comedy, Jim Carrey is good, as always Morgan Freeman is first-rate and seems right at home as God and the cast brings the plot together well. The jokes are almost always on target, although sometimes they resort a bit too much on Carrey's facial expressions. I liked the fact that the movie actually portrayed God, not only that but also as a black man. I thought this quite well, especially with the brilliant Freeman. There are some hilarious scenes, the opening cookie scene for instance, others miss the target slightly but still a good film. 6/7 out of 10"
"Chris_Docker","7","50","69","27 June 2003"," Carrey on form
","Now either you like Mr Carrey's humour or you don't. Me, Myself and Irene had audiences both walking out in droves and, on the other hand, cheering and collapsing in puddles of mirth. Bruce Almighty is a bit more mainstream, but you have been warned.<br/><br/>If you're not sure, watch the trailer. I saw the trailer three times and still laughed at the same gags when I saw the film. If you don't find the sight of a dog putting the seat down after using the loo funny, don't bother with the movie.<br/><br/>Carrey, a reporter stuck in a rut covering 'lighter news' berates God when the whole of his life seems to be going to pot. God takes up the challenge and asks Carrey if he can do better. Carrey gets into the swing of having all of God's powers by making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston)'s breasts bigger, getting himself promoted, and answering everyone's prayers by single stroke computer commands.<br/><br/>This is not a highbrow movie or even that memorable, but it is very well made within it's very limited intent, provides almost continuous laughs to Carrey fans, and even any religious cheesiness is likely to be inoffensive to all but the most narrow-minded god-squadders and anti-god-squadders.<br/><br/>On the more thoughtful level, the film tempts us to speculate about Carrey's own career - stuck in his 'comedy' typecasting he has largely failed to make an impression as a serious actor even after winning two Golden Globes. His most accomplished 'straight' role, the Man on the Moon, is less well known that his comedy romps - or The Truman Show (on which the Academy heaped three nominations whilst bypassing Carrey)."
"PurpleReign1961","8","42","58","25 December 2003"," I laughed so hard and long, my stomach hurts...
","If you want a serious laugh pain, watch this movie, and the things Bruce inflicts on his fellow newscaster. The deleted scenes are priceless. I don't know why they didn't include them in the original movie. It can't be because of time, since the movie is only 101 minutes long. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor, who has been overlooked for too long. Jim Carrey needs meds!"

","Jim Carrey awesomeness throughout! I remember being little and seeing Bruce Almighty with my family in the theater that was precious! Quite enjoyable entertainment that is always a delightful with great effects and comedy that's memorable. I will say though I'm not a fan of the religious stuff but if anything this is my favorite one with aspects of Christianity."
"helpless_dancer","8","38","53","19 June 2004"," Carrey does it again
","Well, was Morgan Freeman any more unusual as God than George Burns? This film sure was better than that bore, ""Oh, God"". I was totally engrossed and LMAO all the way through. Carrey was perfect as the out of sorts anchorman wannabe, and Aniston carried off her part as the frustrated girlfriend in her usual well played performance. I, for one, don't consider her to be either ugly or untalented. I think my favorite scene was when Carrey opened up the file cabinet thinking it could never hold his life history. See if you can spot the file in the cabinet that holds the events of his bathroom humor: I was rolling over this one. Well written and even better played out, this comedy will go down as one of this funnyman's best."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","34","52","17 February 2008"," Lightweight, Fun Look At Thelogy
","As someone who lives near Buffalo, New York, this movie scored points with me before I even saw it, since the story is based here. There are even some bit parts with real-life news-TV anchor people from Buffalo..and, for once, it doesn't knock the area. Hallelujah!<br/><br/>Theology-wise, puh-leeze!!! God is still made to look and think like humans...and, of course, be a bit on the liberal side. Being the lightweight comedy it is, it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes. <br/><br/>There are some laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy scenes and, hopefully, audiences - from Christians to atheists.- got something out of this besides a few laughs, such as what prayer should really be all about. Kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good-hearted film that should offend very few."
"XFLRWF","Null","71","118","24 June 2003"," God doth have a sense of humor
","Whether or not a person believes in God, most people have thought they could make things better if they ran the world.  Some would end world hunger, some would make world peace, and other would just fix the problems in their own lives.  But few people would ever consider the burden and awesome responsibility of the universe's most absolute power.  How would prayers be answered?  How would you handle disasters and riots?  What would you do if someone did not believe in you?  `Bruce Almighty' presents a view of what would happen if a man's will were done. Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a field reporter for the local Buffalo, NY news station.  Tired of doing human-interest stories, being passed over for promotions, and the overall course his life has taken, he calls out God (Morgan Freeman) and claims he can make things better if he ran the world. God hears Bruce's challenge and offers him the chance to prove it.  The Almighty departs for a vacation and endows Bruce with all his powers. Bruce now has the opportunity to demonstrate what kind of God he can be.  The only provisions are that Bruce cannot tell anyone he is God and he cannot interfere with anyone's free will. `Bruce Almighty' is wonderfully done by the talents of creative director Tom Shadyac (Liar, Liar, Patch Adams) and the humorous story by screenwriter Steve Koren (Night at the `Roxbury) and television writer Mark O'Keefe (Late Show with David Letterman).  Shadyac's direction plays a key role to this visually comedic movie.  Not solely relying on his performers, he also implements several sight gags.  Shadyac's eye for comedy comes through when he shows how Bruce organizes his prayer requests, how Bruce dispenses justice, and even when Bruce gets a cup of coffee. The script is also well written by the comedic duo of Koren and O'Keefe. The movie is not only funny but it also looks at the seriousness of what it really means to be God.  Koren and O'Keefe examine how would an average Joe handle the millions of daily prayer requests, would that person abuse his power, and would he ever give up the job.  Don't get me wrong, this is not a movie to would take your children to see to teach them religion.  It is filled with teen and adult humor that fans have come to expect from this genre.  Koren and O'Keefe not only manage to keep the theatre laughing but give God a human face. Jim Carrey gives another great performance as Bruce Nolan.  Known for his way out antics and facial expressions, Carrey combines those talents with a genuine acting ability that sells his performance.  Carrey is very much the common man in his role as Bruce.  He is frustrated with the morning traffic, he wants more in life, and he wants God to make it happen.  Most audiences can identify with his aggravation because most have been where Bruce has been.  But Carrey is also a hilarious man-God when he rules the world.  He has fun with his powers while making sure the best things work out for him. Carrey delivers just the right mix of comedy with a touch of the Spirit. Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston are also enjoyable in their roles as God and Bruce's girlfriend, Grace, respectively.  Freeman plays God with a humanistic yet sympathetic quality.  He not only offers Bruce the chance to take his job, but also is ready to help him out when he runs into trouble or needs advice.  Freeman's portrayal is also what one would expect out of God: warm, endearing, and forgiving.  Aniston's screen time is somewhat limited in the film.  Her performance of Grace is the typical stand-by-your-man girlfriend.  She loves Bruce and will stick with him no matter how much of a jerk he can be.  The role is generic but Aniston plays well with what she's dealt.  Perhaps the scene-stealer of the film is the sidesplitting job done by the Daily Show's Steve Carell.  Carell plays Bruce's main antagonist, Evan Baxter.  Baxter and Nolan's on-going feud sets the stage for very funny on-air showdown in which Carell's performance will have audiences wiping their eyes from laughter. `Bruce Almighty' is no doubt entertaining and humorous.  The movie has all the combinations to make it a success and audiences looking for a good laugh will not be disappointed.  While the movie may be more popular with the teen crowd, adults may also enjoy the film as well.  This is not a Jim Carrey comedy where he talks from his rear but a comedy that also examines a serious nature of life and show's Carrey has evolved as an actor.  But let us hope for Jim's case, God doth have a sense of humor.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"acedj","8","4","4","19 November 2019"," Extremely enjoyable film.
","The is the story of Bruce Nolan, played by Jim Carrey. Bruce is living with his girlfriend Grace played by Jennifer Aniston, and they have a comfortable life together, but Bruce wants more. Constantly looked over for more serious work as a news reporter because of his naturally goofy demeanor, he covets the news lead job that is coming open. When this falls through, Bruce goes on a self destructive rampage, cursing out God the entire time, even taunting him. As luck would have it, be it bad or good, God was listening. He bestows unto Bruce all his powers, to see if Bruce can do a better job of being God than God does. Bruce goes down the path of fixing his life to where he feels he should be, but looses Grace in the process.
Morgan Freeman who plays God, is about the most talented actor out there, and does not disappoint in this albeit small role. The story is great with a lot of laughs thrown in. And yes, there is a moral to this story as well."

Well-crafted comedy suffers from occasional lapses due to conventional story elements, but it's good-natured and consistently laugh-out loud funny, with some terrific sight gags, clever ideas, and a perfect part for Carrey who makes a welcomed return to the kind of silliness that made him a star. ***"

One fine day, the Almighty appears, played by Morgan Freeman. He gives his powers to him see if he can do a better job.<br/><br/>'Bruce Almighty' is a film that I've loved ever since it's release. I remember watching it in L.A., Universal City Walk. I was awed by it, it's such a touching & moving cinematic experience. It has it's share of hilarious moments, but its the penultimate 30-minutes, when the goings-on get serious, those are the portions that leave a strong impression. You weep in your seat and you exit the auditorium in glee.<br/><br/>Steve Oedekerk, Steve Koren & Mark O'Keefe's Screenplay is legendary. Tom Shadyac's execution to the genius Screenplay is completely justified. Dean Semler's Cinematography is super.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Jim Carrey proves his caliber, yet again. He becomes Bruce from scene A itself. He is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman as God, is wonderfully relaxed. Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's Lady-Love is remarkable. This truly ranks amongst her best performances! Steve Carell fumbles beautifully. Catherine Bell looks ravishing! Her performance is just right.<br/><br/>On the whole, One of the Finest Films of 2003. A film that not only entertains, but also leaves you enlightened. Two Big Thumbs Up!"
"sterlinrivera-2000","9","3","3","6 July 2019"," One of Jim Carrey's Best
","From the director of the hilarious Liar Liar and classic Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Bruce Almighty is a wonderfully funny movie with Jim Carrey and easily holds up very well to this day.<br/><br/>Carrey plays a news reporter, Bruce Nolan, who is having a rough life, fails to be a news anchor man and loses to his rival Evan (played by Steve Carell), and people tend to walk over him. He gets mad at God for his misery, so one day, he meets up with God in a bizarre looking building. God (played by Morgan Freeman), gives Bruce god powers to not only make his life better, but to see what it's like being God. Eventually things take a turn for the worst as Bruce loses his girlfriend, Grace (played by Jennifer Anniston), and must do everything he can in his power to get her back.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is a comedy, but it seems like the third act is more serious and dramatic. However, it works because Carrey's character is likable and you feel sorry for him. The first two acts is where the comedy takes place in, and it is done in a great way. Like most of his movies, Carrey delivers a hilarious performance and manages to be as funny as possible. He also had great chemistry with Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston.<br/><br/>The story was pretty good. I can easily compare this movie with The Mask. Instead of him getting magical powers from a ancient mask, he gets powers from God, and is able to use these powers to make his life better.<br/><br/>Overall, Bruce Amighty is a great movie and is one of Carrey's best movies that he has done."
"kyle-cruse","7","10","15","18 September 2008"," Actually better than you might expect
","""Bruce Almighty"" looks and sounds incredibly stupid, especially from the trailers. Nevertheless, I found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more. Bruce (Jim Carrey) is angry at God and is given divine powers by him to be God for a week to see if he can do a better job. Morgan Freeman plays a man symbolized here as God, and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles, he does excellent with what he is given to work with. Although crude at times, the film does have quite a few laughs, from Bruce parting his soup in half like the Red Sea and the customers' reactions to him, as well as Freeman's seemingly laid-back and wisecracking image of God. It is overly exaggerated at times, and there is some crude humor, but overall it manages to be somewhat funny. There is a decent supporting cast, such as Jennifer Aniston, Lisa Ann Walter, and Steve Carrell, which always helps. The end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear-jerking, and the message is clear, that we should do what God has called us to do and ""be the miracle."" The film is far from perfect, but still enjoyable, and far better than I and many people probably would have expected, especially if we see the deeper message of the film.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"J. Spurlin","Null","22","40","13 April 2005"," Even God thinks Jim Carrey is God's gift to comedy in this repulsive effort
","Whenever I watch Jim Carrey I get the feeling he's grabbing me by the collar, slamming his face into mine and screaming, ""Laugh at me! Laugh at me, goddammit, laugh!"" His efforts to be funny seem so desperate and sweaty, yet for many people it works. For instance, the DVD for this movie includes an outtake where Carrey improvises with baking utensils. Director Tom Shadyac cites this as an example of Carrey's genius, but it reminded me of another exhausting comic, Carrot Top.<br/><br/>Even without Carrey, the premise of ""Bruce Almighty"" would be charmless. Bruce Nolan (Carrey) is a Buffalo newscaster assigned to featherweight stories like the creation of the world's largest cookie. When the anchorman at his station retires, he feels he has a good chance to get promoted to the job. Instead, it goes to his loathed rival Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), a fact that he learns while doing a live report from Niagara Falls. This results in a bitter on-air hissy fit in which he insults a little old lady on a tour boat and delivers the f-word right to the camera. Naturally, he's fired. This sets off a chain of events that climax with a group of thugs beating him and vandalizing his car. He blames God for this terrible run of bad luck. God, played by Morgan Freeman in a gleaming white suit, is inordinately angered and teaches Bruce a lesson by letting him take over the job of being the Almighty. Bruce uses these new powers to teach his dog how to use the toilet, give his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) bigger breasts, return to his old job in a blaze of glory – and humiliate his rivals, especially Baxter.<br/><br/>The script makes a few feeble stabs at making Bruce seem other than the raging egomaniac and obnoxious jerk he clearly is. He helps a blind man at one point; he kinda-sorta answers some prayers. But he's mainly unsympathetic; and it seems horrific that God would give this man nearly unlimited powers just to get him to appreciate his girlfriend and learn a dubious theological lesson or two. What about all the other people affected by Bruce's antics? When Bruce inadvertently brings about tidal waves on the other side of the globe, we briefly see a TV news report showing the people harmed by this disaster. How many were killed?<br/><br/>God helpfully explains this favoritism near the end when he tells Bruce he has the gift of making people laugh. I would have said he has the ability to slam his fist down people's throats and rip out the laughs in bloody heaps.<br/><br/>Honestly, I thought Jerry Lewis was the ultimate comedian-narcissist, but not even Lewis had God fawn over his own genius; still less was there a God who let him bumble his way into destroying the lives of those who evidently aren't hilarious enough to receive special treatment.<br/><br/>This movie would have been so much more tolerable – for me, if not Carrey fans – if Bruce had been played by someone more likable. Just look at God Himself to see what casting can do. Morgan Freeman can tell us that a real miracle is when ""a teenager says 'no' to drugs and 'yes' to an education"" and make that crap sound like wisdom. In fact, what if the part of Bruce had been retooled for an elderly man so that Freeman could play *both* parts?<br/><br/>I know, I know. Jim Carrey is a huge box office draw, and Freeman is not. If the real God ever decides to exert himself over trivia, maybe he ought to look into that little injustice."

","`Bruce Almighty' is yet another `high concept' comedy starring Jim Carrey, this time as a self-pitying, put-upon TV news reporter in Buffalo who finds himself endowed with all God's powers when the Almighty Himself decides to take a little vacation.<br/><br/>This material may seem tailor-made for Mr. Carrey's manic talents, but the makers of the film  screenwriters Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk, and director Tom Shadyac  have failed to discover any really innovative ways of approaching it.  When Bruce learns that he has the power to alter the world's reality at will, he spends most of his time playing foolish little parlor tricks on people who irritate him.  Carrey can still be wildly funny when the script calls for him to do that rubber-faced-and-bodied slapstick routine for which he is justly famous, but `Bruce Almighty' is not content to be a cynical, outrageous farce.  It also wants to be a `meaningful' love-thy-neighbor comedy, and falls down miserably in the process.  Morgan Freeman as God gets to do little but deliver high-toned, sappy homilies designed to make Bruce see the importance of the power that's been entrusted to him.  True to the formula  one that goes at least as far back as Frank Capra films in the 1930's  the film turns hopelessly mawkish and sentimental in its final third.  That would be forgivable had `Bruce Almighty' at least given us some cutting-edge outrageousness in its early stretches.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston exudes the requisite amount of charm as Bruce's devoted girlfriend, but the role is hardly one to challenge this obviously gifted young actress (see last year's `The Good Girl').  And there are a few moments when the filmmakers seem to have latched onto a clever or creative concept.  But those moments are quick to pass and, before we know it, we are once again mired in the predictability of yet another manufactured, by-the-numbers Hollywood product.  An additional problem with the movie is that it often defies the essential credibility that even an absurdist scenario such as this one demands.  At least twice in the film, for instance, a flipped out, ranting reporter is allowed to stay on the air long after any halfway competent news show producer would have pulled the proverbial plug on him.   <br/><br/>If it weren't for the presence of the gifted Carrey, `Bruce Almighty' would seem like just another `Bewitched' episode expanded out to feature length. Come to think of it, it feels that way anyhow."
"TheHonestCritic","10","2","2","1 August 2019"," This is the best comedy movie in cinema, in my opinion. (Yet, it's so much more than just a comedy).
","""Bruce Almighty"" (2003), when I first watched this movie, it changed my outlook on the genre of comedy. It's yet another example of what I consider a perfect movie. ""Bruce Almighty"" also happens to be one of my top 10 all-time favorite movies! While ""The Three Stooges"" is my favorite comedy TV show and my all-time favorite TV show overall, ""Bruce Almighty"" is my favorite comedy movie. It's my favorite comedy film of all-time for one big reason; Jim Carrey. He makes this film, had this movie been cast with someone else as the character of Bruce Nolan, this movie might not have worked. Jim Carrey is not the only A-list comedy actor in this movie, Steve Carell; one of my other favorite comedy actors, is in this movie also. These two actors play off each other very well, put them both together and hilarity ensues! Before I saw this movie, I always wondered what it would be like if Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell were in a movie together. Sure enough, it works brilliantly and dreams really do come true! They may not be together during the whole movie, but when they do a comedy scene together it's comedic gold, and in this case less is more. Jennifer Aniston is great as Grace, the fiancee of Bruce. She and Jim Carrey have great chemistry in this movie! Also, they could not have picked a better actor to play God. If any actor could pull off that role, Morgan Freeman is definitely the best candidate for the part. This movie has a great story, great special effects, great sets/locations, great soundtrack, and of course great acting. It fires on all cylinders! As I mentioned, this movie is much more than just a comedy. It has a little bit of drama, a little bit of romance, and a touch of action to keep it interesting. I will not reveal the ending, truth be told, it's one of the best endings in cinema. You'll laugh and you'll cry when you see the ending, but I assure you that you're going to have tears of sadness, but also joy. If you're watching this movie for the first time, bring a box of tissues for the ending. Even though I've seen this movie countless times, I still get choked up watching the ending. This is Jim Carrey's best movie, bar-none. It expands on his true complexity as an actor, and it shows that he can do much more than just comedy. I can watch it 1,000 times in a row and laugh just as hard, if not harder, every single time I view it. Without question, I give it 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen ""Bruce Almighty"", what are you waiting for? I guarantee you that you'll laugh, and be moved like you've never been before in your life!"
"Majikat76","8","2","2","3 April 2018"," What if God was one of us?
","I think every time I rewatch a Jim Carrey movie, particularly this one, I come away with the deeper meaning beneath the comedy. <br/><br/>Truly reflective of all of us, with the humour that is unique to JC!! This is a light, fun film for all"
"meganphipps","10","2","2","24 August 2015"," Jim Carrey at his best!!
","I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I just recently watched this and it still makes me laugh and Jim Carrey as always does his very best. The film from start to finish was amazing as usual, the effects were awesome and the music to the film fit perfectly with what was going on and of course Morgan Freeman was amazing as god. One of my favourite characters has to be of course Bruce, he is funny and also he is such a genuine character. My favourite moment has to be when Bruce is walking along testing out god's powers and the song 'I Got The Power' comes on, funniest, moment ever in the film. If you like Jim Carrey or Morgan Freeman then this is the film just for you. ""He saw and it was good'."

","If God would confide you his Mighty Power, what would you do? Who never ask himself or herself that question at some part of our life? <br/><br/>Jim Carrey is playing Bruce Nolan, a reporter working for Eyewitness News, a Buffalo TV station. He has everything to be happy: he has a nice job, is appreciated by the entire community and his girlfriend. But when the anchorman position becomes available, Bruce got frustrated because his main competition, Evan Baxter (Played by Steve Carell), arrogant as hell, is collecting the good stories and sweeps while he is doing the low grade ones and he's making a fool of himself at each of the stories he's going through. So when Evan is officially promoted to Anchorman while Bruce is doing a live feed, Bruce loses it completely and get fired. The same evening he crashes his car into a light pole and as angry as he can get, blames God for all his misadventures. God, exceeded by all the critic and blame he got from Bruce, decides to challenge Bruce to do a better job than he does. Discovering unwillingly his new powers, Bruce starts to use them to get his life better. But soon, he also have to deal with the other aspects of God life and understands progressively that Being God seems much harder than it looks.<br/><br/>The main source of fun in this movie is not the plot himself but Jim Carrey himself. It's just a pleasure to see him using God's power against the people around him or in various aspects of his own life. This role was made for Jim Carrey and his craziness. We can see how much fun he took playing Bruce Nolan and he literally is carrying this movie on his shoulders. There are several memorable scenes which just make you laugh to tears. It's hard to not laugh watching this movie, really hard!"
"HowlingSnail","8","2","2","4 May 2015"," A ""pleasurable"" film with a lot of lost potential.
","I'll admit, my experience with Jim Carrey movies isn't large, but of the ones I've seen, this is definitely my favourite of the bunch.<br/><br/>The film follows Bruce Nolan, a news reporter who's fed up with his life. He's stuck doing the boring stories, such as reporting on Buffalo's biggest cookie. What he really wants is the job as an anchor on the evening news. When the job opens up, and he doesn't get it, he vents his rage, which results in him losing his job, and getting beaten up by a gang of thugs.<br/><br/>Bruce blames God for his misfortune, so in response, God decides to teach him a lesson, by giving him all his powers, with his only two limitations being that he can't tell anyone about it, or affect free will.<br/><br/>What follows is about half an hour of Bruce indulging in his powers. Whether it's making his girlfriend orgasm from the sound of his voice, punishing the gang of thugs that beat him up, or messing with the man who stole his job to get him fired, if Bruce wants it, it happens.<br/><br/>The problem is what happens next. Bruce girlfriend Grace becomes disheartened with how much of a selfish dick he's become (Or rather, how much of a selfish dick he's always been, but now he can express it more), and leaves him. After that, the entire rest of the film becomes about Bruce moping around, and trying to get her back.<br/><br/>Now, I have no problem with having a little bit of romance in this movie. The problem is the mix. The movie spends just as much time, if not more, on Bruce's failing love life, as it does on the promised Godly antics. I watched his movie expecting a man to have fun being God, rather than it being about him losing his girlfriend and trying to win her back.<br/><br/>The thing is, it didn't have to be that way. Between the deleted scenes available on the DVD, and more scenes that are in the script (some of which were filmed, as revealed by production photos), there was plenty of content that could have been done to stretch out the ""Bruce enjoys his powers"" bit of the movie, so that the movie was closer to what was actually advertised.<br/><br/>Because that's my biggest gripe with the movie; it's unrealistic. Now, I can understand that, despite it being the most realistic situation, this movie can't be 90% sex, since age ratings and all, but I don't believe what we got was realistic even with that proviso. I've mentioned before that the entire last half hour of the movie is Bruce trying to win his girlfriend back. He can't just force her to take him back, due to his inability to edit free will, but did it never occur to him to just erase her memory of what he did? Or just re-wind time to stop it happening in the first place? Especially as Bruce himself said that God could just ""clean everything up in 5 minutes if he wanted to"".<br/><br/>It's these faults that ruin the movie for me, and prevent it from being perfect. Despite this, it's one of my favourite movies, and I do recommend it, if only so you, like me, can wish God would give you his powers too."
"hitchcockthelegend","7","2","2","11 August 2014"," Being God can be Hell.
","Fans of Jim Carrey can't go wrong with this fun filled picture that's not without serious undertones as well.<br/><br/>The Premise is flimsy as such, Carrey plays Nolan, a harried and fed up TV reporter who feels that all of his problems are God's fault. Having enough of his whingeing, God (Morgan Freeman) summons Nolan to his ""residence"" and bestows all his powers to him. This is where the film hits its stride, the makers letting Carrey loose for a number of funny sequences as he plays God to further his own ends.<br/><br/>It goes where you expect it to, and nobody else gets a look in as Carrey does his stuff, but the journey is a most pleasant one. 7/10"
"hall895","7","2","2","6 August 2014"," God is a funny guy
","Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck Buffalo TV reporter for whom things just never seem to go right. Soon after we meet him Bruce is passed over for the big promotion to the anchor desk. He reacts...poorly. And gets himself fired. Who does Bruce blame for this latest misfortune? God. Well, God isn't going to take that lying down. God summons Bruce to an empty warehouse. Hey, if you're God where else would you rather hang out than an empty warehouse in Buffalo? Anyhow Bruce doesn't particularly believe the strange man he meets in the warehouse is God. But God has his ways of convincing Bruce. Turns out God is a bit of a showoff when it comes to using his powers. And now he is going to give those powers to Bruce. If Bruce thought God was doing a bad job well here's his chance to prove he can do it better.<br/><br/>So being given all of God's powers seems like a pretty good deal. And Bruce wastes no time putting those powers to good use. He is able to impress his girlfriend in all sorts of ways. He's able to sabotage his rival and get that anchor job he so coveted. He's even able to get his dog to stop peeing on the furniture. All well and good but all these things he's doing are just for his own personal benefit. When you're God you have to look out for everyone. There are a lot of prayers out there waiting to be answered. Bruce is more than a tad overwhelmed and inevitably he makes a mess of things. And that mess extends to his personal life. Issues with the girlfriend arise. Well that's easy to solve when you're God, just snap your fingers and make her love you again right? Nope, not even God can mess with free will. Turns out being God is no fun if you've lost the love of your life.<br/><br/>As with any Jim Carrey comedy there are plenty of antics from the star. Nothing over-the-top though. And, it must be said, nothing that's really outrageously funny either. This is an amusing movie but not a hilarious one. But what it may lack in huge laughs it makes up for with charm. Carrey is very endearing. Jennifer Aniston does well with the role of Bruce's girlfriend, Grace. Aniston doesn't get many chances to showcase her comedy chops, those moments are pretty much reserved for Carrey. But she's so charming, eminently lovable. And Morgan Freeman is the perfect God. Sly, witty, but with the sense of authority required of someone who is, you know, God. Maybe Bruce Almighty could have been just a touch funnier. Maybe the movie lays it on a bit thick with its efforts to show that Bruce has really learned something. Most people aren't looking for life lessons with their comedy. But the movie does have significant charms. Bruce Nolan is a guy worth rooting for. The love he has with Grace is worth fighting for. And his attempts to play God are worth enough laughs to enable this movie to succeed."
"pinchechadani-992-621166","8","2","2","27 July 2014"," Very Good Movie for Family
","This movie makes me laugh every single time especially the part where Bruce (Jim Carrey) manipulates Evan (Steve Carell) voice! It's incredibly funny... This movie is great to watch as a family, trust me you will have a great time. :) You will learn a very, very good message (in my opinion) to have faith and not to push free will. Another great message is that don't push away loved ones as Bruce did to Grace (Jennifer Aniston) due to him worrying more about his job than his girlfriend. You should not watch this movie if you get offended, or don't like the idea of movies portraying praying,and spirituality. It does have some innaproprate things but still, Jim Carrey, as always will make it more humorous."
"OllieSuave-007","7","2","2","10 April 2014"," Nobody does it better than the Almighty.
","Discontented television reporter Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), on his worst day of his life, rages against God. He responds by appearing in human form (Morgan Freeman) and gives Bruce divine powers, challenging him to take on the big job of being the Almighty.<br/><br/>As the divine-powered Nolan using his new gift, it is actually very hilarious to see him playing tricks on people that annoy him in his life, including the sidesplitting scene where he makes rival reporter Evan Baxter blunder big time on live TV. Makes me wish I have some special powers to counter some of the people that annoyed me to no end.<br/><br/>The film's story also proves that it is not a walk-in-the-park to serve in God's shoes, as he has to listen to all the voices of the people's prayers around him and see what chaotic things actually happen when all people get what they wish for. I think this is cleverly depicted in this movie's solid plot.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the better Jim Carrey comedies I've seen, where he is funny, but doesn't go overboard with the slapstick and silliness. Mixing in the humor with some doses of drama, you'll get quite an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Grade B"
"Stompgal_87","8","2","2","19 August 2013"," One of Carrey's finest
","I've seen this film a few times already. Sure it's not quite as funny as 'Dumb and Dumber' but it still has its laughs and memorable moments.<br/><br/>The best-known cast members in this film are Jim Carrey as the titular character, Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend Grace who is a kindergarten teacher, Morgan Freeman as God (a rather unusual choice but supportive nonetheless) and Steve Carell as Bruce's colleague Evan (who went on to star in his own film as a sequel to this one). As for its memorable moments, these include the giant cookie world record attempt at the beginning, Bruce's dog 'using the bathroom' in the house and Bruce eventually getting him to 'do his thing' outside, Bruce reporting at Niagra Falls whilst wearing an umbrella hat (which I thought he called New York by mistake), a long drawer coming out of a filing cabinet and pushing Bruce along, Grace noticing that her boobs had got bigger overnight, Grace preventing a child from eating paste at kindergarten, another child overhearing Bruce say a** and Bruce telling him he was talking about a donkey, the homeless man holding signs with phrases like 'R EWE BLIND?,' 'THY KINGDUM COME' and 'ARMAGEDDON OUTTA HERE,' and last but not least Bruce causing Evan to mess up during his news report, which was probably the most amusing scene in the entire film.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fine outing from Jim Carrey with a talented supporting cast. 8/10."
"Hey_Sweden","8","2","2","30 June 2013"," Hilarious Carrey vehicle.
","Jim Carrey gets an ideal showcase for his comedic and dramatic talents with this endearing fantasy-comedy. He plays Bruce Nolan, a Buffalo reporter obliged to do silly fluff pieces. What he really desires is an anchor position, and when it's given to jerk character Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), that pushes Bruce over the edge. He's already convinced that God is out to get him, and curses God, prompting the Almighty to take the form of Morgan Freeman and appear to Bruce. God decides to grant Bruce all of His divine powers for a week, to give Bruce a chance to see if he can do any better.<br/><br/>This is a Hollywood movie, of course, and there is a formula to be found in these things, and Bruces' story is at its core a tale of a guy who ultimately learns a lesson and becomes a better person. Before we get to that point, there are some absolutely priceless bits where a confident Bruce delights in his abilities, first just testing them out and then using them strictly to his own advantage, contriving news events so that he can be on hand for them and become a reporting star. Soon, Bruce learns that there is a tremendous responsibility in being God and that he will have to put selfishness aside. He can't take the job lightly, either, although some of his attempts to solve the problem are a howl (that's such a memorable visual when everything in his apartment is covered in post-it notes). Also, with Bruce interfering so much in the course of events in the universe, there will be consequences that he didn't consider.<br/><br/>Freeman, with his effortless charisma, screen presence, and sense of authority, is a natural choice to put a human face on The Almighty. He gives Him a sense of humour and works very well with the energetic Carrey. Jennifer Aniston does a fine job of grounding the material as Bruces' sweet girlfriend. The excellent Philip Baker Hall leads a fun supporting cast in which the always amusing Carell stands out. He, of course, got promoted to star status for the sequel ""Evan Almighty"".<br/><br/>This is fairly manipulative, to be sure, but that's also par for the course with this sort of thing. Still, it's likable and has enough good laughs to size up as another solid teaming between Carrey and director Tom Shadyac, who worked with Carrey on ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" and ""Liar Liar"". Anybody who's a fan of the actors should find this to be quite agreeable overall.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

I actually cried, which hardly ever happens at a comedy. It really got to me, with just the right touches of tasteful humor - not over the top - and fairly well acted.

"tedg","Null","16","32","1 April 2004"," Bad Karma
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Yet another project with bamboo thin scaffolding to support Carrey's version of Jerry Lewis. The problem is that Jerry had a character that he carried from film to film, like Chaplin's tramp. So you knew who you would see and how he would act. The story was just a vehicle. Jerry lived outside the story. <br/><br/>Carrey on the other hand does more or less the same stuff every film, but the character is always within the story. When the humor of the story has to support the humor of the character, you're in trouble unless you have a good idea. And it has to be better than being God, or a mean cable guy or a multiple personality. I do admit that he isn't a bad actor when he chooses projects intended to be intelligent, like `Truman' and `Majestic' and `Moon.' <br/><br/>But then he isn't great in those layered projects either. I haven't yet seen his latest serious project. Kate can really help someone who tries, and Carrey does try and he is smart enough to know smart film ideas.<br/><br/>But not here. Here its just jackanapes. <br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","Yes, miracles do occur. They happen when often least expected, like when I was channel surfing and came across this movie. So I watched it and to my complete surprise actually enjoyed the show. This movie had humor, a good story, solid acting and and overall endearing quality lacking in most, or more accurately practically all movies churned out of the Hollywood movie-making machine. Jim Carrey was actually FUNNY and Jennifer Anniston was wonderful. Morgan Freeman was commanding and Steve Carell was funny too. The scenes with Mr. Carrey and Mr. Freeman were really excellent, well scripted and well acted, making for a compelling movie worthy of positive attention. There might be some who may object to the movie's portrayal of God, but those objections notwithstanding, it's a respectful portrayal and one which helps the audience to better appreciate the pitfalls as well as the benefits of divine power. Excellent movie."

"biba_yu","3","24","57","11 April 2005"," What is the message here...again? Anyone?
","When I read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a God, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, I though that was clever and original concept. Casting was promising too, Carrey, Freeman, Aniston... How can movie with a good idea and good actors, not to mention costs of filming, can be bad? It can. Idea is good, but script and story itself is terrible. Bruce Nolan is, let's be honest, a pretty mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story of a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the Niagara report is complete fiasco!), he's a man with a job he completely DESERVES (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and OH HORROR!!!! Dog who is not house trained!!! Yes, as soon as Bruce, at the beginning of the movie starts addressing GOd in a ""God, why do you hate me!"" manner, average viewer must think: ""Why, what's wrong with your life, Bruce?"". Bruce is not, and definitely NOT the man with real problems in life. Most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes, and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity. Most people have really big problems, worth of attention, most people are more worth of attention that Bruce, who doesn't seem too human after all, doesn't look even realistic, too goofy and neurotic, but God still addresses to him. Why? Though Morgan Freeman looks nice as a God, I can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie. And what does Bruce do when God gives him his powers? God in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference. No, wait, a smart kid would probably use his God powers better than Bruce. What does Bruce do? Pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!! No more, Bruce, please! What Bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie, that doesn't happen, because this is ""nice, family, little movie"" and doesn't make any sense at all!!! Not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!! Nothing. Just Carrey playing silly, which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor. Aniston here is understated. She plays pale, undeveloped character of Bruce's girlfriend Grace, and stays completely forgettable in this movie. Nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them. When Grace says prayer for Bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely false. These two are not meant to be together. I would give three stars, but I doubt movie deserves a one. Bad script, lame dialogs, lack of real humor, wittiness and any sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated Freeman's and Aniston's roles, total lack of boldness and sarcasm, it all makes movie hardly worth ***. But OK, there were few funny moments, and Freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars."

","Love him or hate him Jim Carrey is a master at what he does. He's showcased that in films prior to this (Liar Liar) and in his newer films (Yes man). Much like Bruce he has the ability to bring joy to so many people.<br/><br/>The basic concept of an ordinary man being given the Lords powers is funny on its own but what Carrey and the writers do is create a film that has all the big laughs that a comedy needs while also creating characters that we care about and can relate to. The film also has a moral and a tenderness that Carrey can portray in.<br/><br/>While it's clear that this is Carreys film he his ably supported by Jennifer Aniston and the then up and coming Steve Carell who would later become the lead in this films sequel Evan Almighty.<br/><br/>The casting of Morgan Freeman in the role of God is also inspired and there are few actors who could play this part with such grace.<br/><br/>Overall a great comedy that really acts as a vehicle for the fantastic comedic talent of Jim Carrey."

","This movie is amazing! While being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening. I will watch it again and again. Bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. He has a job and a life, but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. Bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be. As a result of this state of mind, Bruce ends up losing his job and blaming God for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life. God comes to Bruce and grants him Godly powers. Bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. His life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception. In the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him. As the movie unfolds, Bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was truly there. This movie was inspirational and deep. If you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. As my wife says, ""Since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?"" and my humble addition, ""May we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out."""

","Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura) stars as Bruce Nolan, a news reporter who is down on his luck and blames God for his misfortune. God hears Nolan's complaints and comes to earth and gives Bruce all of his powers in this charming and humorous romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Comedy genius Carrey is on top form as Nolan with sharp wit and sophistication in the role of the news reporter. His timing in executing his lines produces brilliant comedy and the physical humour he uses excels brilliantly with great direction from Shadyac.<br/><br/>Carrey steals the show, but great support is given from established actors in Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption) and Jennifer Aniston (Friends). Though hardly challenging roles, both do well in their respective roles to achieve the necessary humour to make the picture enjoyable. Steve Carell (The 40 year old virgin) established himself as one of the current greatest comedians in a supporting role as Evan, a fellow news reporter who is excellent in a live TV broadcast, the funniest moment in the entire film.<br/><br/>The plot is usually predictable and there is plenty of cheesy dialogue but nonetheless but Carrey simply goes beyond belief in perhaps his most likable role, if not his funniest. His partnership alongside Freeman works a treat and is a reason to watch this film.<br/><br/>Although I love Carrey and his comic genius, I would like to see him do more serious projects, like Eternal Sunshine and the spotless mind.<br/><br/>Carry on watching the credits as some hilarious outtakes are included.<br/><br/>The contrasts with normality and fantasy add to the humour and are an interesting side story to the film. The use of free will and the unusual activities caused by Bruce's behaviour are interesting to see, such as what happens when you mess with everyday normality such as the moon and a meteorite hitting earth.<br/><br/>Though following many conventions in the romantic genre, the comedy and the characters are enough to keep the film going and is a real light-hearted good natured comedy."

","Quite possibly the worst movie ever with a man in it. Everything about this film, from the lazy, unimaginative script to the perfunctory performances, lead one to the inevitable conclusion that everyone involved in the making of it should be locked up and shouted at.<br/><br/>It's a movie with a message (ah how sweet) and that message seems to be something to do with not complaining about your lot in life, but just accepting that maybe failure, poverty, sickness or whatever stands between you and a better life is simply what 'god', in his infinite wisdom, has in mind for you. For example, as Carrey's life falls apart, Anniston comforts him with a nauseating, ""Gee Bruce, you know everything happens for a reason"". Infant mortality, car crashes,unwanted teenage pregnancy, war and race prejudice don't happen for a reason, at least not a satisfactory one, and neither, it seems, did the making of this movie. <br/><br/>But apart from that I really enjoyed it."

","This is another Jim Carrey gem everyone must have! Bruce Almighty is a funny as it is. Bruce Nolan(Carrey) is a reporter for a news-team in Buffalo, New York who seems to be anything but happy. You got a job, you should be happy. Not Bruce! He gripes and groans at everything, including to God(Morgan Freeman). So when God talks to him, he gets the message, GOOD!! He gives Bruce his powers, and he does total mischief at first: Making the fire hydrant blow, blows the woman dress up, takes care of the gang which wasn't bad. And the one that busted up my insides, is where he makes his rival, Evan Baxter(Steve Carrell) look like a total idiot on live TV! It took me a while recover from that. Other than that, it's a very awesome movie. Great cast, great plot, great storyline. This movie will leave you in stitches all the way. Lisa Ann Walter killed me on ""Pyramid"", that's another story though. Look up, and watch ""Bruce Almighty"" 5 stars!"

The only exception was Steve Carell's delivery of the nonsense that bruce made him spew (as if you couldn't see that coming). I got the feeling that this movie was made in a bad movie factory. Just press the button and out comes the movie- Bzzzt! shallow hal. Bzzzt! bruce almighty. Bzzzt! bad santa Bzzzt! speed. Bzzt anything with vin diesel. And so on and so on, it's a busy factory. Last year I remember around Emmy time people were wondering why the academy never takes comedies seriously (on behalf of Lost in Translation). I think this might be your answer; it's the crap they can just shovel out. Just come up with a semi or totally unoriginal plot and a few predictable jokes and there you have it *poof* a movie.

","Doubtless fans of the title actor will disagree, but I couldn't find any redeeming features in this film. What starts with an interesting subject (a man given unlimited powers by God) - if we ignore the far superior ""Man who could work miracles"" by HG Wells, which pre-dates this trash by a hundred years - becomes an excuse for 'jokes' and the crudest humor.<br/><br/>
But ultimately what disturbed me was that the moral seemed to be that Bruce himself was free to exercise his 'God-given' powers for his own amusement or to better his own life. Is mankind so enfeebled that it never occurs to the character - except in a token and perfunctory moment - to actually do good with his newly acquired omnipotence?"

I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG!!!<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong.  Little kids will love it and the religious right will embrace this movie as an undeniably factual document proving the existence of a higher power, but there isn't much here for the movie-goer who's looking for something genuinely funny. <br/><br/>Most of the humor boils down to Carrey enunciating a certain word, people falling down or getting hurt, and a ""zany"" catch phrase delivered by Bruce at the end of his newscasts.  There's not much else except for a few very random yet mildly clever moments.  Oh yeah...Carrey curses God excessively throughout the first half of the film to the point where it completely obnoxious and unnecessary.  (I don't even believe in God and it got on my nerves.)<br/><br/>This movie is disappointing and weak on many levels.  Don't believe me? Go see for yourself."

As for the good, Morgan Freeman is very likable in this part.  I liked it when the dog ""learns"" to use the toliet, and the finding of Jimmy Hoffa's body was a great idea.  The monkey out of the butt sure looked painful!  But why would someone want their old job back if they just got God's powers?  You'd think Bruce would try to be President, Governor, or head of a big company.  Of course, you could second guess a lot of it since it dwelves into fantasy.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  It's good for some laughs.  Wished Carrey got God's powers earlier in the film and did more with them.  So, it's worth seeing."

","If some studio head, or person who was ivolved with this film ever reads this, I must apologize for my harsh comments which will ensue. I know that it is very difficult and time consuming to make a movie, whether it's good or bad. It demands time, more money than I care to think about, and the combined efforts of hundreds of individuals. Yet despite all the effort that goes into the production of a film like this, so many films fall under the aforementioned bad category. Bruce Almighty only supports my statement. If one were to read any of my other comments, it would be immediatly apparent that none of them are positive. I don't like to think of myself as an overly cynical person though, rather, I only review movies which in my opinion were overrated. Bruce stands proudly in line with the best of them. It could have been funny, and in fact, some parts were, yet they were all shown in the previews, and so, the movie was entirely predictable by the time I saw it. Not that this would have really mattered. This film tries to blend comedy and drama which movies like Heaven Can Wait have done in the past, and it fails miserably. You don't care what happens to Bruce, or any of the other characters, so when it goes treacly, the hands on your watch begin to move all too slowly. I feel bad putting down Bruce, for it could have been something-yet it wasn't. In addition, it had terrible production value(look at all the streets-they are all on the backlot). I am really off put by movies which act like they are important, and aren''t, and this was one of them."

","Jim Carrey is hilarious but this movie let me down. The whole last hour derails from the horribly stale screenwriting which focuses entirely on the cliched relationship troubles between Carrey and Aniston. I was grimacing at the screen.  The picture starts off really promising. Morgan Freeman is totally cool, as always but at times he does seem like mere set decoration; it feels like they filmed his whole role in one day. Carrey is exceptionally good, he does have the ""power"", zooming along in breakneck comedic pace and he's really funny.  Regretfully, instead of making us continue to laugh the writers decided to make some quasi-serious statement on theology equipped with the standard maudlin movie score which drags the whole mood and eventually the whole movie under never to recover. The screenwriters even get the serious stuff wrong because they hinge everything on Jennifer Aniston's completely underwritten, superficial character. <br/><br/>
I would truly like to know what goes through the minds of those executives in Hollywood. Do they just greenlight any script if they have a name attached to it?  If it's all about money then these guys are penny-wise and dollar foolish.  They know they can make money off of Jim Carrey but wouldn't it suit everyone's interest to make the best picture they can? In Preproduction, the script supposedly goes through tons of drafts.  I know there are great writers out in Hollywood but I'm beginning to think ""Barton Fink"" was a documentary. <br/><br/>Some other user asked if it seems like movies today are getting worse and worse and they definitely are.  What's so insidious about the movies today is that they're not just plain awful like midnight movies or golden turkeys or razzies- that kind of charming badness. Today even the films that have our best talent in them wind up incredibly weak and it has to be the writers and producers' fault. They must have contempt for the public. They continue to pass off the same formulaic stuff over and over like it's Colonel Sander's secret recipe but it doesn't taste good any more.  I guess demographics show that enough ticket buyers keep showing up so why should Hollywood care but wouldn't you think that movies should be even better in this day and age? Now that television, which has never made qualms about being a totally sponsor-driven enterprise, is plagued by all the unreal ""reality"" programming Hollywood is getting away with murder saving tons of dough on junk that previously would only be suitable for cable access. Aren't there any artists left? Why doesn't Hollywood make taking a trek to the cinema a worth while experience? <br/><br/>It's all very sad and my only hope is that God is a movie buff and will send a lightening bolt over to the powers that be in Hollywood because as far as I'm concerned we're in artistic Armageddon."

Unfortunately he doesn't, and this leads to some really annoying moments, where you wonder what is going on and why.<br/><br/>Like some of the catch phrases, the stupid faces and over emphasised movements, and the scene where the newsreader copies his facial movements, and it goes on, and on, and on.<br/><br/>There are a few snigger touching moments, but they are few and far between, and the setups and the eventual plot finish, are so Hollywood formula you want to weep.<br/><br/>Give it a miss.

However, I found myself wanting to laugh at this film with its great premise, but just couldn't bring myself to.  Morgan Freeman was quite good as God, but Carrey seemed to be trying to be even more self-consciously funny than usual (and that's saying a lot)!

Tom Shadyac, who previously teamed with Jim Carrey for Liar, Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective direction is good as always and Shadyac knows the comedy genre very well.

","Bruce Almighty (2003): Dir: Tom Shadyac / Cast: Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Philip Baker Hall, Steve Carell: Film about the suspension of self. Bruce Nolan works for a news network where he is bypassed for position as night anchorman. He lives with his girlfriend and a dog that uses the sofa as a toilet. He blames God for his misfortunes until God meets with him and proposes him his job. Bruce enlarges his girlfriend's breasts and makes his dog literally use the toilet. Provocative yet predictable with a touching climax. Directed by Tom Shadyac who previously collaborated with Carrey on the inferior Liar Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Jim Carrey displays our frustration and lack of understanding of who God is. Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is straight forward seeking to move on to the next stage of their relationship. She is merely a prop for sexual sight jokes. Morgan Freeman plays off the wisdom of God who steps aside and allows Bruce to realize the true nature of God although Bruce becoming the likeness of Clint Eastwood fails because it is the media concept of Eastwood instead of God's creation of him. Philip Baker Hall also makes an appearance, and Steve Carell is also featured in a sabotaging segment that doesn't elevate his comic potential to the heights it would later reach. Film demonstrates God's power and our inability to fathom it. Score: 7 / 10"

At first, Bruce has a great time bending the world around him to his will, much to the puzzlement of his girlfriend, Grace, but after six days God stops by to remind Bruce he hasn't done much to make the Earth a better place. Disappointed, God presents Bruce with an ultimatum wherein he has one day to improve the world in a concrete way, or God will toss the planet back into the void. <br/><br/>Carrey is hilarious in the slapstick scenes being the Supreme Almighty and it has an interesting premise wherein he plays God.Also,the film mostly succeeds at fusing his talents as a comedian which makes it a funny and heartwarming movie.It is the kind of movie that is made for Jim Carrey himself and no one could play the main character perfectly except him."

Also, unlike most comedies, the main character goes through a change. Bruce starts out as a bit of a jerk who likes to blame God for most of his misfortunes. Then, God notices this and meets Bruce, giving him his powers for a while. At first, Bruce uses the powers to only his advantage.

","Bruce Nolan was an aspiring journalist who wanted nothing more than the local anchorman job in Buffalo, New York instead of doing funny bits of news like the introduction where he is at Polish bakery celebrating the city's largest chocolate chip cookie. It starts off smart but it wears thin overall. Bruce is played by the unforgettable Jim Carrey who is brilliant at physical comedy much like John Ritter, Don Knotts, and Jerry Lewis in this film. Morgan Freeman plays God who transfers his powers to him to see what it would be like to be God. So Bruce is now God and he must hear prayers and confessions of everybody. God's job is not easy if you are believer. He has a lot of work but I take this comedy as is rather than serious drama. Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend (how did Brad Pitt trade her for Angelina is beyond me?). She is equally superb in the straight woman role. There are supporting players like Steve Carrell, Nora Dunn, and Sally Kirkland to name only a few."

The story might be interesting but in the end it is forgettable and I think the movie sucks anyway... no offense to Carell, maybe he shouldn't be a sidekick of a Jim Carrey again because Carrey loses his box office magic just like Mariah Carey's Glitter days. Steve Carrel stands out of this his big debut on screen. I only appreciated Carey on the movie Liar Liar & Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and I am not a huge Jim Carrey Fan.

Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is essentially a mix of previous Carrey films Liar, Liar and The Mask. If you've seen those two, you can pretty much guess what's coming. Most of the time, Almighty is a horribly bad film. Carrey's manic tantrums and crazy antics were never that funny to begin with, and by now it's been done to death.<br/><br/>The film is divided up into three parts: An introduction where we get to know (and hate) Bruce, a middle part where Bruce has fun with his powers, and a third part, where Bruce learns the errors of his ways and becomes a better person. The beginning is bad, the middle has some fun bits, and the end is half an hour of excruciating torture.<br/><br/>Instead of entertaining, the film raises some questions. Does anybody want to see this kind of sappy endings, where the protagonist gets a moral education in order to become a better human being? What made Aniston's character Grace (see what they did with her name there?) fall in love with Bruce in the first place? Why are the effects so cheap looking? How much money did Morgan Freeman get to sign on for this mess? It's doubtful that this film would have been made if Carrey hadn't starred in it. It's just not funny. On an ending note, and for future reference - any screenplay that includes such ""hilarious"" catch phrases as ""B-E-A-utiful"" or ""Good, gooood"" should be burned. [2/10]"

He lives with Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), a teacher of children, who loves and wants to marry him. Bruce is a very selfish, grudging and envious man. While presenting a live event in Niagara Falls, he is informed that Evan was chosen as the new anchor man. Bruce gets crazy, says a lot of wicked and non-sense things to the audience and is fired. Bruce blames God, and sooner he is called by Him. God (Morgan Freeman) decides to go on vacations for a week and gives all His powers and duties to Bruce, but the power of changing the free will. With his greed, Bruce commits lots of mistakes, but in the end he is redeemed. The plot of this movie could be funnier. However, the nasty personality of Bruce does not help much. Jennifer Aniston is beautiful as usual and performs a nice character. I myself expected much more of this movie. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""O Todo Poderoso"" (""The Almighty"")"

","I thought the movie was funny but I believe Jim Carey did carry the movie. There are not enough well developed characters in the movie so it is hard to really care about them at all or have a sense of who they are because all you get are glimpses of characters. I love the fact that they had a black actor play the part of God because so many times he is assumed to be a white man with a long flowing white beard and it is good to break stereotypes. Also I can imagine that many of us might react the same way in the beginning if we were bestowed with the powers of the almighty.<br/><br/>The key thing to remember is as they said in the movie that we all have free will, and how does God get people to love Him when there is free will to contend with. For that matter how does any of us get someone to love us? You have to get to know that person first right? How do you get to know God? Just a thought to ponder."

","High Concept bulls***, peppered with Smaltz and a ruinous injection of sentimentality from Jim Carrey and the usual suspects. A one note premise for Carrey's familiar blend of hyperactive slapstick, gurning and shouting. Basically this is the script for Liar Liar with a different conceit. Once again through the course of the story Carrey redeems himself by realising whats really important and putting others first (Its the family stupid). Ahhhhhh. We're asked (again) to feel for the woman (this time Jennifer Aniston)who fell for this immature misfit but now realises hes not interested in a mature, responsible relationship. Well I say tough. They fell for him because he made them laugh of course, after all as God reminds Carrey in a scene saturated in back slapping egomania from the star in question, Carrey makes the whole world laugh - thats his gift.

"bob the moo","Null","4","9","22 June 2003"," Very slight film that is almost totally carried by Carrey  although even he wears a bit
","Bruce is a reporter chasing the job of anchorman at his station.  When he is passed over yet again he rages at a God who allows so many bad things to happen in his life.  God decides to teach him the difficulty of his job and also the downside of giving man freewill by giving Bruce the powers of God for a short while.  Initially happy with the ability to use his powers to his own benefit, Bruce quickly learns there is more to it than just magic tricks.<br/><br/>Having seen the trailer I assumed that this was going to be a really funny film and to it's credit, it almost manages to be for a lot of the film, but this is not so much to do with the plot as it is to do with Jim Carrey's delivery.  The plot is quite lazy and it isn't clear totally what the moral of the story is  even at the end I wasn't totally sure that the film knew what point it was making  that we have the power to do miracles, that God is busy, that being God is hard, that selfishness is wrong?  Well  it could be all of these as the film never nails it down.  The film's best bits are where Bruce is allowed to run wild with his new powers and after this the film sags a bit as it then starts to look for something resembling a plot to try and form an ending around.<br/><br/>The film drops in a scene from It's A Wonderful Life, which gives you a clue as to what it is trying to be  it wants to be a warm fuzzy feelgood film too like Capra managed.  It is worth noting that the classic Capra we have today were not so warmly received at time of release so perhaps that isn't too good an aspiration.  It never manages to pull that off anyway as the moral is where the warmth should come form and, as I said, this bit is muddled.  The film is strongest when it relies on Carrey to deliver the goods and he does.<br/><br/>For the vast majority of the film, Carrey's mugging saves the day and he makes the material funnier with his delivery.  After a while his catch phrases wear a bit tired (`B.E.A  utiful' started to annoy me) but mostly he is funny.  The funniest line in the whole thing for me was when God said `alrightie then' in the style of Ace Ventura  but I think I was alone in that as no one else in the cinema laughed.  Beside Carrey the rest of the cast are mere background for him to bounce off  only his scenes with Freeman appear to share equal weight and Freeman brings a good air to the role  not trivialising the role but not allowing it to be heavy to the point of killing the film.  Aniston is OK but is really just there to provide a plot for the final third of the film.  Hall is solid and gives the impression of the support cast being quality in numbers.<br/><br/>Regardless of the fact that this film is mainly one big sketch (man gets God's powers) with a bit of a plot tacked on at the end to justify a film, it is actually quite enjoyable.  If you dislike Carrey's mugging then there is very little else here for you, but his energy and delivery save the film even if he does misjudge some of his dialogue and jokes."

The movie should've been funnier, much funnier, especially since it stars comedic talent Jim Carrey, go figure. Bruce Almighty stoops to childish mediocre stunts to gain laughs, but fails miserably at it. Steve Carrel, another comedic talent, is in the movie, but he is a flop here as well.

"jma5072","Null","3","6","2 August 2007"," More of a Drama than a Comedy...Bummer
","I had pretty high expectations for Bruce Almighty. Not that it would be Jim Carrey's finest, but that it would be somewhat comparable to some of his blockbuster comedies back in the day like Dumb and Dumber (1993) and The Mask (1994). Needless to say, Bruce Almighty falls well short of its potential. With a pretty good storyline and a talented leading cast, featuring Carrey, Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman, there's no reason why this movie should have turned out this bad. The story begins with Bruce Nolan (Carrey), a depressed and cynical Buffalo news reporter, having a very very bad day. So the day after 'the worst day of Bruce's life', God approaches him, who offers to instill him with all his powers for one week. Sounds good enough, eh? Well, yea, a first, but Bruce Almighty is poorly directed and it lacks focus. First, Bruce makes horrible, unimaginative, use of god's powers. Creating a gust of wind to blow up a woman's skirt? Getting his dog to use the bathroom...properly? What about stopping time or time travel, or exploring other countries (within reason)? Wouldn't you do such things if you had god's power? The possibilities are endless yet the director keeps Bruce's usage of these unlimited powers grounded in practicality and insignificance. Then there's the issue of the prayers Bruce must answer. He answers ""yes"" to all of them to save time, and the consequence of his action is that the Buffalo Sabres win the Stanley Cup. What about those who prayed that the Sabres opponent would win? Not everyone's a Sabres fan. Their prayers weren't answered. Perhaps Bruce thinks that up-state New York deserves preferential treatment. Adding to the disappointment is that Bruce Almighty really isn't even that funny, aside from the few scenes that are geared to showcase up-and-coming comic Steve Carrell, and not Carrey. There's no chemistry between Carrey and Jen Aniston (his estranged live-in-girlfriend) and Jim himself just seems kinda bored with the whole production. Also, the final quarter of the film assumes an unexpectedly serious atmosphere, as its tone shifts unevenly from comedic to melo-dramatic, but neither work particularly well. Does this want to be a comedy or a drama? No one really knows. There's just far too much of that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" morality filler instead of the great comedy we all came in expecting from it. A misfire all the way.<br/><br/>Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4"
"cherold","5","3","6","18 December 2004"," unrealized potential
","This movie really ought to have been funnier. It's not that it's a great premise - it's pretty daft, actually - but it's a workable premise. You've got Carrey with ultimate power, which offers all sorts of opportunities for humor. Yet the film rarely made it above mildly amusing and often couldn't even manage that. I think much of the problem was the movie was torn between wanting to be funny versus wanting to be touching and profound (since they throw in a scene from It's a Wonderful Life I tend to suspect they were hoping for something with that feel). The end result is a movie that fails to succeed comedically or emotionally. Bruce is not an especially sympathetic character, he's so petty and self centered that it's hard to take much of an interest in his problems or his life or his decisions. I thought Freeman made a pretty decent Lord Almighty and the bits with the dog were cute, and it wasn't so bad that I gave up on it, but it's really a movie where you just wonder, why did they even bother making this?"

His problem, when he has one, is when TOO MUCH Jim Carrey comes out, a similar problem with certain Robin Williams roles. And that is the problem I have with 'Bruce Almighty.'  Little of what Carrey did in this movie was enjoyable to me. The funniest scene was where he, playing God in the studio background, makes his rival the news anchor make funny faces and babble incoherently while on the air. But it wasn't Carrey that was funny.

","Why did I go to see this film? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? Additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston's involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside  encouraged me.<br/><br/>However, as my ""one line Summary"" suggests, I was Disappointed. For various reasons;<br/><br/>Reason 1: It wasn't funny. In a 2hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking ""I really should have got some ice-cream"". I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gem's such as 'The Truman Show' , 'Liar Liar' , 'Me, Myself and Irene' , 'Dumb and Dumber' , 'The Mask', and the 'Ace Ventura' films then produces, in Bruce Nolan's own words, such a mediocre film?<br/><br/>Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston's role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! She's been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.<br/><br/>Reason 3: One word - Cliché<br/><br/>Reason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite 'sweeps week' - is a clue to the film's specifically home-grown appeal. ""A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - that's a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!"" God tells Bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. Additionally, I still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend's are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?<br/><br/>In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards."

","Jim Carrey is one of the funniest and most gifted comedians in film today. With his hyperactive spontaneity and his rubber face he can just go crazy, and we love him for it. He has the ability to make mediocre comedies (ala Ace Ventura), and turn them into decent comedic outings. Or, in the case of 'Liar Liar', make them some of the most hilarious contemporary comedies around. Carrey has also proven himself capable of tackling dramas. He was excellent in both 'Man on the Moon' and 'The Truman Show.' The guy is remarkable.<br/><br/>Then comes 'Bruce Almighty,' an ideal vehicle for Carrey, and a premise that should have worked; Carrey, after complaining about God and how his life stinks, is enabled with God's powers. However, the script is pure recycled garbage. Now, no matter how bad a script is, Carrey's improvisation alone sometimes makes an unfunny scene funny. The problem is that there are very few opportunities for Carrey to be unleashed because so much of the comedy relies on silly special effects, only some of which are amusing. Carrey is rarely able to improvise because he has to work around the special effects. The writers apparently thought that all these special effects and superpower sequences were funny, because the rest of the movie is simply filler giving Carrey nothing else to work with besides a whiny character who is absolutely humorless. He seems more like a 5-year yearning for our attention, wanting the viewer to find what he is doing funny, when it's really just annoying.<br/><br/>I have always enjoyed Jennifer Aniston on 'Friends' and she was superb in last year's 'The Good Girl.' She too has a gift for comedy, but with the script as linear as it is, she is simply given the part of the bitter girlfriend. She comes across as nagging, grumpy, and there is no chemistry between the two stars.<br/><br/>'Bruce Almighty' should have been a comedy that works. But it doesn't even have the guts to tackle the subject matter that it's making fun of; religion. A few minor giggles (his internet is Yehweh), but instead it's just turned into a comedic superpower comedy. Not to mention that it's tone shifts from silly to heavy-handed, and even black comedy at times. The movie fails on nearly every level. That's not to see it is entirely devoid of laughs, but it's close. Any movie that feels the need to incorporate scenes of a dog peeing to get it's laughs has problems. But hey, if you find pee jokes funny, go for it."

There are so many theological plotholes its staggering, but granted it's only a film. I probably wouldn't have had the time to notice the inconsistencies if the movie wasn't so BORING.

Yesterday, my bubble got burst big-time, boys and girls, because I saw the movie. <br/><br/>The first act (where it's set up that he hates his life, he's a disgruntled employee and a majorly unhappy camper with an ax to grind against God) is serviceable, the second act (where he's summoned by God via telephone and receives Powers Almighty) is GREAT - Carrey gets to have fun with his new 'toys' and it's a pleasure to watch, really funny.  But the third act is wretched beyond belief.<br/><br/>The rot starts setting in after the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who comes off EXCEEDINGLY well in this movie considering her part is merely a plot device; even her NAME reeks of unsubtlety) - she thinks he's gonna pop 'the question' but instead, he tells her (on bended knee, yet) that he's finally getting his news anchor job, and isn't it so exciting?<br/><br/>She doesn't think so.  She wants him to marry her, see, so she winds up leaving him, see, even though she still LOVES him very much, see, and the rest of the film is spent banging us over the head with one pathetic, beyond-heavy-handed spiritual-sounding cliche after the next, until by the end I was praying, too. . .for it to be over. <br/><br/>I didn't mind the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (one example - in the 2nd act, after he gets his powers, Bruce prances into the room singing ""What if God were one of us, just a slob like one of us"", blah blah blah), and I was even willing to overlook the amazing amount of contradictions being hurled at us (for openers, Morgan Freeman - a/k/a GOD - tells Bruce he can't violate anyone's free will but he does this, a lot). Those choices were forgivable - this is a Jim Carrey comedy, directed by Tom Shadyac - it aint The Remains of the Day. <br/><br/>Or rather it was SUPPOSED to be a comedy.  When the script writers lose track of that (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the proceedings into some sort of (gag) Message Movie, what we get instead is hell on earth. Bruce realizes the error of his selfish ways, he realizes that GRACE is his saving - have to say it - grace, and that his priorities in life had been severely misconstrued.   All this could have been conveyed in a far less heavy-handed way, however. The film didn't have to go into the dumper to make these points.  Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to resolve the story in any sort of clever, light-handed way, so they went the bang-'em-over-the-heads route in hopes that we wouldn't notice. They even tacked some surprisingly unfunny out-takes at the end, in the further hope that this would lessen the bad taste.  It didn't work for me."

","Jim Carrey is a funny guy. I've seen him in a lot of productions, and he has never failed to make me chuckle. This role is no exception, he has several hilarious moments involving his new-found mystical god powers, including when his partner gets an unrequested prompt boob job, he forces a girl's skirt up in the street and the whole business with the alphabet soup in the cafe. But for me, by far the greatest part in the film is where he loses it on a boat after finding out a rival anchorman has beaten him to a top job, his facial expressions and bitter, twisted attitude to everybody around him are priceless. Yep, for the first 45 minutes or so, life is good and the movie is consistently amusing.<br/><br/>Alas, when we get to the middle of this particular morsel we discover a very gooey centre. Not a nice, sweet taste but a horrible, saccharine concoction that will send all self-respecting diabetics into sugar shock. The script requires Jim to experience a 'spiritual reawakening', so he stops messing about with his abilities and starts using them responsibly to help those less fortunate than him. This may be a laudable aim, but it sucks all the humour out of the proceedings like an extra-strong vacuum cleaner. We begin to wonder if we are watching an after-school special rather than a comedy, and the film is derailed irrevocably. Patricularly painful is the ""Answering Wishes On The PC"" sequence, which may seem warm and tender to some but to me the cloying sentimentality almost made me taste breakfast again. Mind you, at this point you get the impression that the unimaginative screenplay writers had run out of decent jokes anyway.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman has a couple of unimpressive cameo appearances as the Lord, Jennifer Aniston is largely wasted as our hero's long suffering partner and there are more dodgy dog jokes than you can shake a stick at (Arf, Arf). And of course the ending is happy, as our protagonist learns that he must not take life for granted and to treasure those that are close to him. He even apologises to those who treated him like a jerk in the first place. Give me a break!! What a pathetic, sappy little man he is.. and how hard it is to care about his fate or build up sympathy for his plight. Sorry Jim, you had me at first, but you really went and blew this one. Next time, try and cut down on the cheese, and just concentrate on making us LAUGH. Not too much to ask, is it now? 5/10"

","I'm a Jim Carrey fan, so this movie was a huge let down. He did his best (as always) but there's just no substence to the film. Mildly amusing for the first 20 minutes and then one  l-o-n-g  yawn, heavily laden with sickly-sweet moralising. The only thing that caught my attention was a comparison I found myself making, throughout, between Jennifer Aniston's atrocious performance and that of the much prettier and vastly more talented Maura Tierney in an earlier Carrey movie, Liar Liar. I'd love to say that Aniston spoils the movie, but her rotten acting was just one small, if expected, minus. All in all, a brilliant concept executed VERY badly. I'm glad to see that most other reviewers didn'y like this movie either. I'd love to see Jim Carrey & Maura Tierney work together in future as they had real chemistry. As for MS Aniston, I hope she falls into a huge vat of $1000 bills and is never heard from again."

"mightyjabba","Null","2","4","19 September 2003"," Disappointing. Carrey deserves better.
","Jim Carrey's latest film sees him star as a man frustrated at the bum cards that God has dealt him. His ranting provokes God (Morgan Freeman) to allow Bruce (Carrey) to take control of his power and responsibility for one week.<br/><br/>
Director Tom Shadyac's latest collaboration with Jim Carrey (they previously worked together on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Liar, Liar) is at times riotously funny, but generally insipid and therefore a bit of a disappointment. It would be impossible to blame Carrey for the film's failings, he is a wonderful comedian, and an improving actor, and it would be very difficult to think of anyone who could have done the job better. Carrey's abilities as a screen comedian are showcased to full effects in a stupendously funny 20 minutes after he has been blessed with Godlike powers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the filmmakers couldn't resist the temptation to moralise and sentimentalise the movie, and the film is all the worse for it. Bruce is a spoilt, wealthy man with a beautiful wife and a lovely apartment, it takes every ounce of Carrey's charm and manic energy to make us even care about Bruce, but it is incredibly difficult to think that there is no-one more deserving of God's special attention than this whining yuppy. And as for the portrayal of God, any film that has a character grow into itself and become happy by becoming subservient to God, a Christian God imbued with American values at that, vies between far-fetched and offensive.<br/><br/>In the end, it is a real shame that such a high concept comedy is mired down with such a sickly sweet world view, the thought that God will make everything ok in Bruce's life is liable to stick in most of the viewers throats. Carrey's presence will ensure decent box office returns, its just a shame that the film cannot give Carrey the vehicle that his talents deserve."
"gbheron","4","2","4","8 September 2003"," Old Time Religion, Modern Hollywood ***Spoilers***
","This is an odd movie; its values are strictly social conservative, but the story takes place against the backdrop of a large city television newsroom. Seem a little incongruous? Its even more so when you realize the primary actors are Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Anniston. And the films style is essentially a slapstick comedy accentuating Carrey's patented rubber-faced, self-effacing schtick. Strange, yes, but a winning combination scoring an $80M opening weekend. <br/><br/>Big money maker or not, I found the movie unfunny and boring. The premise that God would select a failed TV newsman to replace Him while He took a vacation is just too absurd. Someone like the Marx Brothers could have had a field day with this premise, but you sure wouldn't have found them developing a maudlin, sappy conclusion like the one that Bruce Almighty serves up. After an hour and a half of mostly unfunny Jim Carrey pratfalls, the movie presents its ""come to Jesus"" revelatory moment and Bruce is saved (in the religious sense).  After all the damage he'd done playing God, you'd have thought him more deserving of a one way ticket to Hell."

I see there are over 250 comments on the movie on IMDB, and I have only read about 40, but surely I cannot be alone in stating the obvious; Bruce Almighty is a reworking/remake - call it what you will - of Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>Vain, shallow minor media celebrity, thinks he deserves a lot better than he's got and goes through a  bizarre supernatural experience to find redemption and make himself a better person.<br/><br/>But Groundhog Day did it with imagination, wit and emotion (the benefits of a great idea, a clever script and superb actors).<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is just a tired re-tread showing little imagination and going for obvious belly laughs. Even the incomparable Morgan Freeman can't really do much with this material.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey has his moments I suppose, but he is a one trick pony.<br/><br/>I really am an incurable optimist. Time after time I go to movies like this hoping for the best, and always coming out disappointed. Oh well!"

","This film has excited some controversy from devout Christians because of it's rather whimsical view of God. I'm not religious by nature but it occurred to me in watching this film that a true believer would have little use for it. Why would God ""go on vacation"" and leave his powers to a self-centered loser like Jim Carrey's character? Maybe he had in mind a lesson for Jim but what about the effects on everyone else, which includes a tidal wave that kills people? To a believer, God is more than the product of a screen writer's imagination but that's all we see here.<br/><br/>	The film also commits another type of sacrilege by showing a clip from ""It's a Wonderful Life"", hopefully suggesting that this film is a modern version of that one. Actually in tone and substance it more resembles Mel Gibson's film ""What Women Want"", although even that film is better than this one. After all the ""hey, look what I can do"" gross-out humor, (such as a monkey who makes a home in a thug's rear end), the sentimentality that dominates the end of the film comes out as phony and superficial.<br/><br/>	The same is true for Carrey himself who continues to play his roles as if he were a split personality, Jimmy Stewart meets Jerry Lewis. Somehow the combination reduces both of them. In ""The Majestic"", it was mostly Stewart in another derivative film, (""The Return of Martin Guerre"" meets ""Cinema Paradisio"" meets ""Guilty by Suspicion"" with the Sullivan Ballou letter form Ken Burns ""The Civil War"" thrown in). In this one it's more Lewis. Carrey has to find the right combination- or find his own persona- now that the teenyboppers who improbably made ""Ace Ventura"" a hit have grown up.<br/><br/>	Meanwhile, like moths to a flame, other performers are attracted to a Carrey film for the exposure what they presume will be a guaranteed hit will give them. Morgan Freeman plays God as a janitor, (maybe the one bit of true cleverness in the film: he's always asked to clean up other people's messes). Jennifer Anniston is the girlfriend who is both hopelessly smitten by Carrey yet disgusted by his self-absorption. Catherine Bell of JAG plays a sexy newscaster who tries to seduce Carrey at a party. Whether they got what they wanted from appearing in this film remains to be seen. This member of the audience sure didn't."

But the worst sin is that this is just another obnoxious guy learns his lesson and becomes a better man because of it story, and I didn't buy for a minute that Carrey's character learned anything, despite a few trite apolgies and forced repention scenes toward the end.

","But I guess without having high expectations to begin with, it could have been an even greater disappointment than it was. I love Jim Carrey. Brilliant man. However, this movie is sadly half- um... donkeyed. The story is incredibly uninteresting and ultimately anti-climactic. People often describe disappointing comedies by saying, ""All the good jokes were in the preview,"" and in this case it's true. Which is even more pathetic when you consider that the preview was pretty unamusing. A dog using a toilet! ha. ha. Seriously, it is a crime how much screen time is wasted on that dog. Somehow the creators seemed to think that the humor of this film was in the lame special effects, and not the brilliantly funny comedian who stars. Morgan Freeman is at times, well... embarrassing. Who does he think he is, Jim Carrey? Toss in some sickly saccharine lessons of morality and there's your big summer blockbuster Carrey comedy. It's really a shame when the funniest moment in a Jim Carrey movie comes not from the star, but from Daily Show anchor, Steve Carell. His scene of vocal manipulation had me with tears in my eyes. But rather than redeem this film, it made me wish I was watching the Daily Show instead. Unfortunate."

","""Bruce Almighty"" starts out as a comedy, and a very funny one at that.  The first half of this movie has many laugh out loud moments, and the news broadcast scene is one of the funniest five minutes of film shot in a long time.  I laughed so hard that I cried.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie gets too caught up in delivering its message in the last half.  The pacing slows to a crawl, and its stops being funny and starts being preachy.  We get speeches instead of laughs.  The ending is trite and it hurts the film.  The message is, in fact, a clichÃ©.  There's nothing new or different about it.  It's been done so many times that one wonders why the director and writers feel the need to beat the audience over the head with it.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey isn't nearly as over-the-top as he's been in the past.  His acting in this film is more like what he did in ""The Truman Show"" but with more of his physical humor.  Morgan Freeman as God is unconvincing.  His acting seems too hollow, and he just doesn't seem to be into the role. There's something missing from his performance.  Jennifer Aniston takes up space on the screen; there's not much to be said about her.  Any number of actresses could have been cast in the role of Bruce's girlfriend.<br/><br/>If the movie had stuck to comedy and not tried to deliver its message in such a heavy-handed way it would have been a terrific film, and it's worth seeing just for the newsroom scene.  However, done the way it is, I give it 6 out of 10.  It's above average, but not by much.<br/><br/>FOR ALL THE FUNDAMENTALISTS WORRIED ABOUT THIS FILM MOCKING GOD:  It doesn't do that.  In fact, it points out what a tough job an anthropomorphic deity has in dealing with the human race, that being God is no fun, and that humans aren't good substitutes for the real thing.  It does, however, beat us about the head for a good deal of the time that the idea of ""surrendering to God"" is a pointless thing to do, and in fact (SPOILER ALERT!), when Bruce does it, he gets run over by a truck.  So you probably won't like it.  Oh well."

Finally having enough, Bruce comes in contact with the one and only God (Morgan Freeman) and gives him a taste of his power to help take care of business ; since Bruce thinks God isn't doing anything right. Written by Steve Koren (Seinfeld) and Mark O'Keefe (The Weird Al Show), the script to this feature brings on a narrative that's funny and may actually have the viewer realize something about themselves when the end credits roll. That's pretty good for a Jim Carrey film.<br/><br/>Seeing Bruce Nolan go through the expected emotions of attaining god-like powers is funny. When gaining that kind of ability, of course one will take matters into their own hands and right their own wrongs first. But of course having such incredible powers, comes great responsibility as cliche as that sounds. But it's true and the writers help put that into perspective not only for Nolan but the viewers themselves. There's only one major plot hole that came about that didn't make much sense. When God gives Nolan his powers, he says no to do two things. First, not to tell anyone and two, that he cannot affect free will. Yet somehow, Nolan can make his dog do things for him. So is it just human free will he can't control? If not, then he lied because a dog is a living being too, just not as sophisticated as a human.<br/><br/>The actors are no doubt comical in their roles. Jim Carrey makes plenty of funnies throughout using his usual brand of humor. While Jennifer Aniston is nowhere on the comedic level as Carrey, she has some very deadpan moments that help ground the situations that ensue. The same could also be said for Morgan Freeman who stares down Carrey's character with truth and honesty in every word that he says. Even Carrell who has a much smaller role, gets his moments to do some crazy things. There's also appearances from Philip Baker Hall as Nolan's boss, Catherine Bell as a co-anchor of the news company Nolan works for and Lisa Ann Walter as Grace's sister, who also talks some sense to Nolan. Considering this is coming from director Tom Shadyac, who made Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), it's a surprise change in execution.<br/><br/>When it came to visuals, things were pretty good for 2003. The tricks used to make things look believable do not look put together last second. Things like added hand digits or walking on water all looks very well done. However, one thing element that doesn't look anything special is the cinematography. Which is odd because it was shot by Dean Semler, the cinematographer to The Road Warrior (1981), City Slickers (1991), The Three Musketeers (1994), We Were Soldiers (2002) and later on Maleficent (2014). The shots of the city and other streets are just boring and lack anything that stands out. However the film score provided by John Debney did a wonderful job. The music is light and energetic, just like the main lead and the antics that come about. Not anything shy of what he's done before.<br/><br/>While there's one noticeable plot hole and the cinematography isn't anything to be impressed with, the rest is a fun feature. The actors all give entertaining performances, the comedy is funny and the writing behind it not only gives some good laughs, but also has a message about taking on life and what do to about it."

","Why did I hate this movie? Because it insults intelligence. Had Bruce Almighty been content to follow the well-trodden path of mindless comedies, it might have worked. After all, the scene in which Bruce embarrasses a TV anchor is genuinely funny. But director Tom Shadyac can't resist slipping into Patch Adams mode. The result is a painful final act in which Bruce learns the hard lesson that the greatest power of all is to help others. Also considering what Bruce does with God's powers, he must have an I.Q. of about 10. About a hundred good plots could have been written with this backstory - anything from a straight comedy to a tragedy, with various stops in between - but Bruce Almighty misses them all. What does Bruce do with his great powers? Use a gust of wind to flip up a woman's skirt, pull the moon closer to Earth, and move aside traffic. No stopping time. No visiting other planets. The gag of Bruce doing silly little things with his powers is amusing for about 60 seconds, then it loses its appeal."

","I first watched this when I was 8, which surprised me since it was PG-13 and my parents restricted many movies from me for religious reasons.(Witchcraft, nudity, language, etc.-some of those are fair but others seem far fetched.)<br/><br/>Anyways, I'm 20 now and this movie is even more enjoyable. Part of that is understanding adult jokes that originally went over my head. I'll get back to that.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a news reporter who is mad at God. And why not? He lost his job, gets beaten up by a gang, and is seen as less superior to a co-anchor. Well, God(ironically played by atheist-agnostic Morgan Freeman) comes to him and gives Bruce his powers for a week to see if he can do a better job.<br/><br/>This-at first-seems great. Now to deal with his problems or have fun, he can lift a woman's skirt, part red soup(in reference to Moses), lasso the moon(in reference to It's a Wonderful Life), view prayers on a computer file, make his girlfriend have an intense orgasm, and much more. (I don't want to spoil for you what he does with a monkey.)<br/><br/>But then Bruce gets a taste of how hard being our Maker is. Maybe being a human isn't so bad.<br/><br/>I mentioned that there were adult jokes. If I did not get them when I was 8, your kid probably won't either. I recommend kids around there and up to see this. (If they don't know the F word-there's one use to watch out for).<br/><br/>One joke that used to go over my head is when Steve Carrell's character Evan annoys Bruce, so he says, ""Do you like Jazz, Evan? Let me play some for you."" He makes sounds and twiddles his fingers like an instrument, and raises his middle finger when he holds a note. As a kid, I was like ""Why are the others in the room laughing?"" Now I laugh at that as well.<br/><br/>Theist or not, Bruce Almighty is a very comedic and fun movie that really is heavenly. There's a lot of laughs- and a wonderful theological message along with them."

","Bruce Nolan is a news reporter working for a TV station in Buffalo, New York. He isn't satisfied with his life though; he is fed up of getting the more lightweight stories to report on while his rival Evan gets the more serious stories. When Bruce learns that Evan has been promoted to a job he wanted just before he presents a live report he finally snaps. This cost him his job and soon it seems as if everything is going wrong for him; the only thing good in his life is his girlfriend Grace although he somewhat takes her for granted. As more and more things go wrong he starts to blame God for all his woes... then one day he receives a strange message offering him a job. He goes to see what it is about and finds himself face to face with God! God proceeds to give Bruce his powers and tells him to do his job for a while. At first everything is great as he uses the powers to his own advantage but there are consequences; when he tries to help others by answering their prayers things get even worse... Bruce learns that being God isn't easy.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Jim Carrey then I expect you'll enjoy this as he is on fine form as Bruce. His gurning style may be too much for some people but for the most part he is funny rather than annoying. The story is entertaining and despite the subject matter I don't think it will offend too many people... it is never stated that God is the god of any one faith and his depiction is respectful; the fact that he is played by an on form Morgan Freeman helps of course. There are plenty of very funny moments; the best being a slightly crude scene involving a gang member and a monkey. The supporting cast is solid; most notably Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell as girlfriend Grace and rival Evan. The film's conclusion is hardly surprising but that isn't a problem; we can enjoy the journey even though we know the destination. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody wanting a good laugh; especially if you are a fan of Jim Carrey."

","In the comedy, ""Bruce Almighty"", Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is passed over for a job as anchorman on their local news channel. He believes that God is forgetting his needs and blatantly ignoring him. God (Morgan Freeman) contacts Bruce and gives him all his powers as a test for Bruce to show that he can do a better job. With his new powers, Bruce uses them for himself until he realizes the world's prayers are being unanswered. Before writing this review, I have watched Bruce Almighty countless times. It's my favorite movie, it's funny, and my sister and I enjoy watching it together because it's a very family friendly film. Based on the first category, Action, I would give this movie an A. There's little suspense, but the comedy in the film keeps the viewer interested. A good example of action in this film is when Bruce runs into a group of gang members beating on a homeless man, later he runs into the same group, this time, scaring them off using his newly found powers. This movie deserves an A in the category, Actors. Jim Carrey is so funny and outgoing but also believably serious when he is needed to be. A great example of this is when he asks Grace (his ex girlfriend) to come back to him and give him another chance (serious). When she refused he tried to use his powers to make her love him again even when he knew he couldn't go against free will (goofy). I gave Bruce Almighty an A in the category, storyline. The story is wacky, funny, and easy to follow. An example of putting comedy into this movie is when Bruce went to the cafe right after gaining God's powers and prating the tomato soup, resembling the parting of the red sea mentioned in the Bible. In my opinion, this film is an A in length.The runtime is about an hour and 40 minutes long. The movie is not extremely long but it's long enough to keep the viewers interested and you definitely feel satisfied by the end. In the category, cinematography, I rated this film a B. It doesn't have horrible editing and effects but they're not extremely impressive or believable. An example of this is when Bruce was filming a segment on his news channel and wanted to bring interest, so, using his powers, he made a meteorite crash down in the distance. Not fabulous editing but it made it funny. As a result, in my opinion, this move has 4 A's and 1 B. It's a great family movie and it's funny, Interesting, goofy, and some-what sad at times. It's perfect for late movie nights if you're looking for a good laugh."

","Jim Carrey's comic charisma almost makes 2003's Bruce Almighty sitting through...almost. But if you're a hardcore Carrey fan, your tolerance of this film could be a little higher.<br/><br/>Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a TV anchorman who feels that everything in his life is turning to crap, triggered by the loss of a promotion to an obnoxious co-worker (Steve Carell), who starts being very vocal about the way God is ruining his life and that everything that has gone wrong in his life is because God is too busy to pay attention to him, which results in God (Morgan Freeman) appearing to Bruce and offering Bruce the challenge of running the world by transferring all of his powers to Bruce.<br/><br/>Despite solid direction from Tom Shadyac, who also directed Carrey in Liar,Liar and Carrey's ability to make the most lame material funny, this film is about as predictable as they come, which includes Bruce's initial selfish use of the power he's been given, the abuse of the people in his life he cares about, and his eventual epiphany about how hard God's job really is.<br/><br/>Carrey generates sporadic laughs, as does Steve Carrell as Evan Baxter, Carrey's obnoxious colleague and Nora Dunn as Carrey's boss, but Jennifer Aniston's role as Bruce's girlfriend, Grace, is thankless. The best thing about this movie is the classy presence of Morgan Freeman in the role of God. His performance alone makes this movie worth sitting through. The movie was followed up by Evan Almighty."

","Bruce Almighty is a 2003 American fantasy comedy film directed by Tom Shadyac, written by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk and stars Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck TV reporter who complains to God (Morgan Freeman) that he is not doing his job correctly, and is offered the chance to try being God himself for one week. This is Shadyac and Carrey's third collaboration after working together on Shadyac's first film, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, in 1994 and Liar Liar in 1997.<br/><br/>When released in American theaters in May 2003, it took the #1 spot at the box office, grossing $85.89 million—higher than the release of Pearl Harbor, making it the second-highest-rated Memorial Day weekend opening of any film in motion picture history (until the release of X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006).[3] The movie surprised media analysts when it beat The Matrix Reloaded after its first week of release.

","What would happen if a normal person got given god-like powers? That's the question this movie revolves around as Bruce, a down on his luck news reporter finds himself with said powers after he blames his misfortune on God. As Bruce comes to terms with his powers, he does what everyone would do- improve their life massively. Hilarity ensues, with monkeys coming out of butts, traffic clearing instantly, etc. Along with all the gags scattered throughout the film, it also gives a good insight into what would occur if someone came across such power, making you question if it really is such a good thing. This is clearly Jim Carrey at his finest- he expertly slips into the role of Bruce as if he was born for this role. The cast is great and the writing is greater- this movie is definitely worth viewing just to see Jim's character become overwhelmed with power. 8/10"

","This movie is really just awesome. It's so good. It's funny, obvious it should be, as it's a comedy, and it's not over the top. It has great, serious moments, but you love the comedic ones more, which you should. I'm going to say that if you don't like comedies, you will not like this movie. And if you don't like comedies, why are you wasting your time watching one? <br/><br/>This movie is about a man named Bruce, who is TV reporter in Buffalo, New York. He is disconnected with almost everything in life. Even though he is very popular and has a girlfriend, Grace, who really loves him. Bruce has the worst day of his entire life and at the end of it, he gets really mad at God. Saying very bad things in the heat of the moment. Unexpectedly, except to anyone who saw the trailer, God responds to Bruce and gives him the power and responsibilities of God. He challenges Bruce to take on the job and try to make everyone happy. Which we all know is impossible. Bruce accepts and does his very best, but he's just not cut out for being God. <br/><br/>Favorite Part Of The Movie: When Bruce is figuring out how to get all of the prayers and read them all. He makes the come up in many different forms, such as letters and Post-Its. Then he does them in emails, which works way better. And he tries to grant everyone's prayers, but it just doesn't work. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10."

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","0","18 October 2013"," What would happen if we had the power of God?
","When this movie first came out I was really excited about it because it was one of those movies that focused on God and I thought that it would be a good movie for Christians to watch with their friends to help us spur conversations about Christinaity. However, now, ten years after this movie was first released, and having watched it now about five times, I am not so sure as to whether it really is a Christian movie. Since there are 586 reviews for this movie I will simply focus on the Christian content of this movie, and whether it is really what one would call a 'Christian movie'.<br/><br/>To put it simply, it is not. While it does deal with the themes of the existence of God, and of God's love, as well as God's unwillingness to intrude on our free will, and also touching on the idea of why God does not necessarily answer prayers they way we want him too, I feel that the Christian element of this film is sadly lacking. The reason that I say this is because there is no mention of Christ, or even of the Trinity. Secondly there is no mention of human sin, or of our need for redemption. Rather it portrays our spiritual reality in a form in which there is really only God (and yes, he is a God of love) and Christiaity is not the only monotheistic religion with a loving God. In fact, I feel that what this movie is simply doing is merging the Christian and Jewish faiths, and is probably more Jewish than it is Christian.<br/><br/>The interesting question that is raised in this film is the question of what one would do if one woke up one morning with the power of God. I think the film answers this question brilliantly in that one would probably do things that simply served one's own purposes. We see this happen almost right from the beginning where Bruce gives himself a Ferarri, teaches his dog to use the toilet, sets himself up as 'Mr Exclusive' and then sets the rival TV network up for smuggling drugs. Further, he decides that he thinks that it would be better if God answered all his prayers with 'yes' only to discover that chaos results.<br/><br/>However Bruce does come to understand that with great power comes great responsibility, and it is a responsibility that he does not feel that he can handle. For instance, he pulls the moon closer to the Earth so that he might have a romantic evening with his defacto wife, only to discover that this causes a tidal wave in Japan. He also causes a meteor to strike so that he might capture the story, only to discover that it results in constant black outs. He also ends up setting up his rival, and snaring the coveted anchor position, only to discover that he does not want it. Finally, even with all of his power, he cannot change his defacto's heart after she walks out on him.<br/><br/>I suspect that many of us out there would love to have the power of God, and would think that if we did then we would use it to make the world a better place. However what we do not have is God's wisdom, nor the desire to really make the world a better place. To many of us in the post-modern world, the whole concept of 'the world as a better place' really only focuses on our own particular world. Especially here in the wealthy and industrialised west, we don't actually see that what we have is actually pretty good – we actually want more. We see this with Bruce at the beginning, where he does have a good life, and wealth, but he is not satisfied with what he has, and it is only after he loses what he really wants, that he ends up learning that what he had was all that he really needed."

","This neat idea works on many levels and if like me, you haven't always enjoyed Carrey's OTT mugging and frankly annoying persona at times, it just works better here.<br/><br/>We all know the structure to this, where Bruce (Carrey) is given God's powers, by God, a regal white-suited black man, Morgan Freeman, giving the Lord an accessible and friendly, even 'human' persona. Once he has these, Bruce breezily sets about getting what most of us men would be tempted by, bigger breasts for his fiancé (Jennifer Aniston), a new stylish wardrobe and many other slightly dubious wishfuls, pushing the boundaries of taste, but, in my view, not over-extending them, the certificate 12 pointing at this.<br/><br/>Revenge to street punks after they laugh and mock his wish for a peaceful world is wreaked in imaginative and witty ways, done with good SFX. Some fairly obvious musical links could mar (Barry White when Bruce pulls the full moon closer, when he intends an ultra-romantic night with Aniston) but generally these are fun and don't outstay their welcome.<br/><br/>However, when Bruce kind of uses his powers for his own uses and gets his old job back and things go swimmingly but as backlashes and repercussions from his spontaneous 'miracles' backfire and he loses the love of his fiancé, his powers disappear. The film obviously intends this to have a moral resonance but the light-hearted nature of the comedy obviously dilutes this and some might miss it altogether, whilst the religious will suitably feel that some justice has been done.<br/><br/>It does get rather mushy and a bit sickly as Bruce finds that Grace, his fiancé has been praying to the real God (God has an extremely popular and busy email address for prayers that Bruce has access to, another nifty idea!) that her Bruce can find the errors of his ways etc etc. Get over this rather icky patch and you'll bask in the afterglow as the film concludes."

The wonderful chemistry, between Jim Carrey and Jennifer Aniston made them a beautiful on-screen couple trying to cope with the things life dishes out at you. And my favorite line in the movie came from when Bruce was trying to stop Grace (Jennifer Aniston) from leaving him: Bruce: You can't leave me, I'm the Alpha baby, I'm the Omega lady.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is a slap stick comedy, something that Carrey fits just easily, the movie is funny and the ideas that the writers brought to the screen to show the height of selfishness in the heart of a man who had power, was something that I found to be true.<br/><br/>One of the ideas that can be said to have taken from Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), is when Bruce actually lassoed the moon, something George Bailey said he was willing to do for Mary, in the scene (in the movie it's a wonderful life) where both walked home singing buffalo girl.<br/><br/>Directed by Tom Shadyac, whose first directorial film was also with Jim Carrey in the Ace Ventura series, which is the only movie that Jim Carrey did a part two of.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around Bruce (Jim Carrey) who complains about how God is not being fair to him, so one day he gets a visit from the Almighty God (Morgan Freeman), who gives Bruce his powers to do as he pleases.<br/><br/>But things turn from sweet to sour when Bruce learns a hard lesson, that being God is not just as easy as he thought.<br/><br/>Although highly criticized the movie has a huge cult following, (I included as I have seen this movie countless times) in the box office it made over 480 million dollars (its production cost was 81 million) in its theatrical run, no matter what the critics say you just want to see what Bruce did with God's power.<br/><br/>A sequel Evan Almighty was done in 2007 with Jim Carrey refusing to reprise his role as he doesn't like playing the same role twice, the movie did have Morgan Freeman reprise his role as God and this time the center character was Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), the antagonist of the first film. Evan Almighty was a financial blunder, not recouping its production cost in the box office.

"LadySailor1975","7","0","0","1 May 2012"," As Usual, Carrey Delivers Laughs with a Moderate Plot
","I did laugh a lot. I will be honest about that.<br/><br/>Bruce Nolan is a selfish and conceited man who does not think of the needs and wants of others and does not consider consequences of his actions. All he cares about is ""me me me me me."" Bruce constantly complains about God and says that God is ignoring him and maybe even laughing at him. One day, Bruce meets God face-to-face and is given God's powers. The first thing he does is set the wheels in motion to get back what he wants; such as lead anchor at the news station and getting his rival fired. He does eventually ""help"" the people that pray to him, but he simply answers ""Yes"" to all the prayers and this sets off catastrophe, such as hundreds of lottery winners all at once and each winner getting only 17 dollars. Riots break out and things go just as bad for Bruce himself as he realizes what he has done.<br/><br/>Becoming God would not solve all your problems. God is not a lucky horseshoe or rabbit's foot. He does not interfere with free will, which is just what the movie does state. The biggest mistake the movie was that God says ""they have the power"" as if saying ""they don't need me."" Prayer and action go together. People who do follow the Bible will tell you that. You cannot just pray and expect to get what you want. If you need a job, pray and go out and apply. Take the right actions and pray, and God will lead you to the right job. You cannot just pray and wait and expect that somebody will ring your doorbell and say ""I want to hire you for my company!""<br/><br/>Sometimes, God does say ""no"" to what you ask for. Maybe he has something better for you later. God helps those that help themselves. If you were just to pray and do nothing, you will not obtain what you want/need. <br/><br/>The plot holes in the story did have to do with free will. Bruce does seem to interfere with it, such as making Tony Bennett wave at him as if he knew him. But, all movies have plot holes. <br/><br/>Altogether, this movie is fun.

","After experimenting with more serious roles and flirting with critical acclaim in films such as 'The Truman Show' and 'Man On The Moon', Jim Carrey made a (relatively) toned-down return to comedy with this 2003 smash, showing flashes of the comic brilliance that made 'The Mask' and 'Ace Ventura' such massive hits. Bruce Almighty is at once a simple but also potentially tricky premise; a downtrodden journalist (Carrey) complains one too many times about God's role in his life, and is thus imbued with all the powers of the Creator – along with all the hitherto unconsidered responsibility that goes with it. What follows is a film along the well-trodden typical rom-com path; jokes, puns and sight gags for the first half, before giving way to more serious stuff. As a result, partly due to the weighty subject matter, Bruce Almighty gets somewhat bogged down at the halfway point by questions of morality and philosophy as well as the usual relationship issues, which causes the film to drag and sit heavy before returning to the path to the ending.<br/><br/>So, what would it be like to be God? Serious question! Fortunately, thanks to Carrey's presence, there are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments (in between typical gags of sledgehammer subtlety), as the lead is given the opportunity to wisecrack, gurn and impress as only Jim Carrey can, while still pulling off the hangdog everyman he perfected as Stanley Ipkiss. There is enough zing in Carrey's performance to remind viewers of his similarity to a young Robin Williams – fortunately minus the Chewbacca-esque body hair! Meanwhile, even in comedy, Morgan Freeman still exudes the same air of confidence, trustworthiness and gravitas that typifies all his roles, thus adding credibility to possibly the most impossible role of all: God. Yet, after his convincing turn as the President of the USA (Deep Impact) several years previously, it seemed like a logical career progression. And would you really want anyone else as the Alpha and Omega? As it turns out, Freeman is given little do but play straight man to Carrey's funny man, yet he still manages to steal the film from right under the lead's nose, all the while occasionally espousing pseudo-moral message. Plus, he wears a sharp suit so slick he makes Humphrey Bogart's Rick look downright shabby! As always, Jennifer Aniston isn't taxed in her role, playing her usual variation on 'Rachel from Friends' - sweet, lovable and attractive but with little more depth than a kiddies' paddling pool! But then, why would they? It's Carrey's show.<br/><br/>However, where the film seriously starts to falter is when the 'com' portion of the film takes a back seat to allow the 'rom' portion to take the wheel. In a typical rom-com this would be predictable but acceptably sappy, but with the added questions of personal responsibility and morality – something not new to Carrey films (Liar Liar). Add that to the film's skirting around the edges of religious questions such as the existence and power of God, and no wonder the film is used in R.E. lessons up and down the country! But, if you can forgive the occasional holier-than-thou message which sometimes veers into outright preaching, what you have is a classic Carrey comedy that can be easily enjoyed.<br/><br/>Just try to see it as a film, not a sermon!"

","Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.<br/><br/>Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.<br/><br/>Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's.<br/><br/>Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.<br/><br/>So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)"

How about rearranging every bit and piece of your life, and making it to your liking. But soon your going to realize that everybody else wants change to, but your soon going to realize your being selfish with your powers... Bruce Almighty is exactly that, and a bit more. It depicts the message, mixing in a little vulgarity, and making it quite a picture. The acting in this film was pretty good. I didn't expect the best, but I got more than I wanted. Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, and Morgan Freeman make this film; even the parts with Steve Carrel. Then we have the next stupendous act, the message. This is why the film gets an 7 for me, because it shows something while not trying to put it out there too much. It's heartwarming, and a bit hard to see through. It shows life, but tries not to. I love that. Everything else was projected pretty well too. The reason the film isn't a 10 for me is because the film tends to be a little childish with it's humor. I mean there's LOTS of hilarious scenes, but sometimes they set the boundary a little too high... or a little too low. Either one, it didn't do it for me. I loved how they showed Morgan Freeman as God (while also making a point) but hating the fact that Jim Carrey had insects flying out of his mouth. All I had to do was get through it, and you will too. I highly recommend this film for people who love films with a message. If your not to fond of crude humor, you might want to stay away, but also know that the film is making points with and within. To make a precise similarity, if you loved Click (even with it's vulgar humor) then you'll love Bruce Almighty. Just know when the laugh and when not to laugh. Bruce Almighty... 7/10."

","The leading star hadn't made a slapstick comedy since The Grinch, and the concept of this one sounded really good, and it was good to know he was reuniting with the director that made him a star, Tom Shadyac (Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, The Nutty Professor, Liar Liar). Basically Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a news reporter for Channel 7 Eyewitness News in Buffalo, New York, with girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), and he dreams of one day being the new anchor, but this is taken away by the annoying Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) who rubs Bruce's nose in it. Bruce has a series of really bad luck and feels like he is being picked on by God, and when he really breaks he lets rip with blasphemy and insult to the big guy in the sky. Then he gets a message from an unknown number, inviting him to a secluded building, and that is where he meets God (Morgan Freeman), and eventually he says he is going to give Bruce the chance to do his job better, by giving him all his powers. When Bruce has mastered the use of the powers of the almighty, he uses them to his advantage, to make himself a bigger name in the news reporting stakes, but leaves little room for time with Grace and the meaningful things. God also reminds him that with all his powers he has responsibilities, most importantly answering people praying, so Bruce sets up a Yahweh! account on his computer to answers prayers as emails, but he is lazy and just says ""yes"" to all, which slowly causes worldwide chaos. When Bruce gets the opportunity to be the new male anchor, after making Evan look a fool, he lets it go to really sort out the world's problems, and then he finds out Grace is one who prays too, and he gets upset with what he hears. In the end he decides he doesn't want to be God anymore, God takes the powers away, and Bruce goes back to normal with a seemingly improved life with Grace. Also starring Philip Baker Hall as Jack Baylor, Catherine Bell as Susan Ortega, Lisa Ann Walter as Debbie and Tony Bennett. Carrey is really likable as the newscaster using God's powers in a cool way, Aniston is appealing as his slightly unappreciated girlfriend, and Freeman makes a very cool and majestic God. Obviously all of the best jokes come from Carrey using the divine powers, best part being making Carell talk gibberish, and also making Aniston's boobs bigger, blowing a woman's skirt up, and much more, a fun comedy fantasy. Good!"

","Not only is this part perfect for Jim Carrey, but this is one of those rare movies with an original idea: Exploit God.

To be fair, I think, the film gets a little bogged down with Carrey's mannerisms towards the end. But of course, it doesn't detract from the pleasure of watching Carrey or the film.

","I like some of Tom Shadyac's previous work, I loved The Nutty Professor and Liar Liar, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was enjoyable. Of course Even Almighty, which followed this film was no-where near as good as any of these. Jim Carrey is one of my favourite actors, but Bruce Almighty sees him in one of his finest roles. I always maintained that he is a fine actor, verging on the genius (especially in comic-value). Morgan Freeman was also brilliant to watch in this, he was the wise Lord of all, with a sense of humour. Together with these terrific performances is a really well written script which not only has some really prominent things to say about religion and faith, but also about relationships and about ourselves. At the end of the day the film is very humbling, especially as we see Carrey's character develop. Jennifer Aniston normally annoys me, but I feel she gives a good performance in this, Steve Carell can also be annoying, but it fits his character here. And the thing that amazes me most is that it gets the balance perfectly- it still manages to get all its points across whilst still being very, very funny."

","Bruce Almighty is a decent movie. It is no masterpiece, but it is still entertaining, is well performed and has a sense of fun. The reason why I don't think is a masterpiece is mainly because of various factors it didn't quite convince as much as it should have done.<br/><br/>The movie has a good soundtrack, and a great premise. The performances are what made the movie as entertaining as it was, with Jim Carrey in his usual over the top performance pitch-perfect as Bruce Nolan and Jennifer Aniston as lovely as ever as Grace. Steve Carrell has his moments as Evan Baxter. The real acting kudos though has to go to Morgan Freeman, who is such an exceptional actor who rarely disappoints in anything he's in, and he was great as God. There are as I have said some hilarious moments, the news station scenes were particularly hysterical.<br/><br/>However, there are some problems that marred an otherwise decent movie. The middle act is rather slow moving and not very much of interest happens sadly. I also found it rather short for a comedy, if it were fifteen minutes or so longer it could have had more scenes to develop the characters and story more. And while on the whole the movie worked there are parts in the script that are overdone.<br/><br/>On the whole, despite being disappointingly uneven, it is a fun and decent comedy, that is well performed and has a nice message.

","I first saw ""Bruce Almighty"" in late 2003 and recognized the star, Jim Carrey. I was seventeen years old at the time, and thought this was a good movie. There are some comedies I saw around that time and found really funny, but watched again several years later and happened to find them very straight-faced, such as ""Johnny English"", a film I saw on the silver screen that year. However, that hasn't quite been the case with this particular comedy. I watched this again in early 2007, and it seemed to be just as good as before. Over two years after that, I've seen it again, and this time, I was slightly disappointed to find that I didn't like it as much as I did during my previous two viewings, but still can't join those who say it's not funny.<br/><br/>Bruce Nolan is a news reporter in Buffalo, New York who lives with his girlfriend, Grace Connelly. He does human interest stories, which he is tired of, and hopes for the position of anchorman. Unfortunately for him, that position goes to his rival colleague, Evan Baxter, and after Bruce loses control during a live feed from Niagara Falls, he is fired. After a very bad day, Bruce blames all his problems on God, and is soon confronted by the Almighty! Since the fired reporter has been complaining to God so much, He has decided to give Bruce His powers for a while, to see if he's any better at ruling the world. At first, Bruce takes full advantage of his new powers, and his life appears to be improving. He even uses his powers to get Evan fired so he can take his place, and he doesn't have to worry about his dog urinating on things inside anymore. However, his luck doesn't last, as doing God's job gradually gets harder.<br/><br/>Every time I've watched this film, the part where Bruce uses the powers he has gotten from God to make Evan really screw up his report has made me laugh so incredibly hard! There aren't too many comedies I've seen with gags I find THAT funny! That's definitely the funniest part, but there are other memorable gags, such as Bruce freaking out during his live feed around the beginning (which is what leads to his firing), the way the main character gets his revenge on a group of thugs (though I didn't find that one quite as funny as I used to), and Bruce's meeting with God on Mount Everest. Jim Carrey sometimes goes a little overboard with his goofiness, such as the several times when he says, ""It's good. It's goooooood!"" Fortunately, for the most part, this isn't an issue. Also, ""Bruce Almighty"" is not all comedy, as there are serious parts as well, plus some life lessons, as others have obviously pointed out already.<br/><br/>Not only does this 2003 release feature the same star as 1997's ""Liar Liar"", both films were also directed by Tom Shadyac. As popular as ""Liar Liar"" is, I just couldn't get into it with Jim Carrey's voices and sounds. The main reason why I think ""Bruce Almighty"" is much better is because Carrey doesn't do that as much here. If you can't stand Carrey as a comedian (it seems he has a lot of critics, which I can understand), and/or you can't stand to see God portrayed in human form (played here by Morgan Freeman), this is definitely a movie you should stay away from. However, if you're a fan of Carrey (die-hard or moderate, I guess) and you want a combination of goofy, sometimes crude comedy and drama/life lessons, you could get a lot out of this film. There's obviously no guarantee you'll like it, but if you ask me, it's worth a try."

Do you think that God would snap his fingers and make your problems simply disappear or that maybe God would sort of take a vacation and give you His powers for a while to see if you could do His job better? If you thought the answer about God giving you His powers was correct, then clearly you haven't been reading your Bible all that closely, but you have probably been watching or at least heard of the movie starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, ""Bruce Almighty"". ""Bruce Almighty"" is the story of a down-trodden news reporter, Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), who believes that the entire world, nay the universe, is against him in all that he does. Bruce's girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), tries to assure him that one of these days things will begin to turn around for him, but Bruce doesn't believe this to be true. So after lashing out at God in anger, accusing Him of not doing His job properly, Bruce is given a life-changing opportunity. A personal visit with God (Morgan Freeman), leaves Bruce endowed with all of God's powers, and God challenges Bruce to see if he can do a better job than the Almighty God can. Truly one of Jim Carrey's most hilarious performances since ""Liar, Liar"" or ""Dumb and Dumber"", this over-the-top, laugh until you hurt comedy will leave you wanting to go back to watch it time and time again. ""Bruce Almighty"" may come off as blasphemous to some, though I'm a Christian and I found it to not be blasphemous, but that's my opinion and not everyone agrees with me. Though this movie is truly hilarious, there are some deep issues regarding faith, and man's relationship with God that get explored here. Even though I don't believe this movie was written by a devout Christian, it still manages to deal with issues of free will, the corruption of absolute power, surrendering to God's will, and God's love for mankind, in very real and engaging ways that can be taken to heart by any Christian. I truly believe that Christians should watch this movie, but bear in mind that there are moments that may be offensive to some, and times that tread on borderline blasphemous, but in the end this film steers clear of that territory, and comes out on top. I did say that I feel that Christians should watch this movie, but actually anyone who is looking for a movie that will have them laughing constantly should watch ""Bruce Almighty"". I guarantee you will enjoy it."

When he demands of Miss Aniston ""Love me,love me,love me"" he is echoing the command many American comedians issue peremptorily to their audience ,one which does not settle too well with the more delicate stomach of the average Brit.

A 'normal' every day guy getting God's power, who of course at first start using it for his own benefit and pleasure but soon starts to realize the great responsibility of it and of the ability to help out people. It of course gives the movie plenty of material to create some fun and hilarious sequences around this premise. The movie is also filled with comical moments like this, which makes ""Bruce Almighty"" a very enjoyable and fun to watch movie. Definitely better than 90% of the comedies being released in cinemas these days.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey really makes the movie funny. He plays his character in a great comedy way and provides the movie with a couple of hilarious sequences but he also is great and convincing in the more 'serious' moments in the movie. But it seems a bit silly that he's spoofing some of his old previous comedy roles. It's never a good sign when a comedian starts to spoof his own previous roles. It often means that their careers are over, though I don't expect to be this the case with Jim Carrey.<br/><br/>Too bad that, like always, Jim Carrey has to carry the entire movie on its own. Sure, the movie features many other big names, such as Morgan Freeman, Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston and Philip Baker Hall but when it comes down to the comedy of the movie, Carrey is mostly on his own, although I think that this is also the way he likes it. Morgan Freeman is a good and fun God and Steve Carell also provides the movie with a couple of laughs. And regarding Jennifer Aniston; Sorry. Never have really been a big Jennifer Aniston fan, not even of her looks.<br/><br/>The second halve of the movie becomes way too moralistic and preachy toward the ending. The movie tries to bring over a moralistic message in a too forced and obvious way. It causes the second halve of the movie to be less fun, though it obviously still features some great comedy moments. This sort of moralistic movie and story can only work once, so I also don't have very high hopes for the sequel ""Evan Almighty"". I just don't think it will work out.<br/><br/>The movie is well directed and has some excellent comedy timing.

It is a pretty decent idea (A doubting Thomas who is given the power of God), but chooses to be a vehicle for Jim Carey's zaniness (I never really understood the attraction to him.....OK on a show like ""In Living Color""....but who can take 2 hours of it). How much better it would have been if Carey played this role like ""The Truman Show"" or ""Eternal Sunshine...."". Instead it is just another forgettable comedy. It made money, so I'm sure there will be more of this type coming out.<br/><br/>See ""Pleasantville"" for a much better executed fantasy.<br/><br/>Eric"

","This movie doesn't have a god. Morgan Freeman is there, and his benign countenance is as welcome as it's ever been.<br/><br/>But Freeman is absent from the theme. Movies written by slapstick industry figures are modest enough that they still come with a message, a theme. They aren't collapsed in existential heaps, wailing about post-modern meaninglessness.<br/><br/>It hardly matters that Freeman is a bit player: he isn't the funny bone in this movie's skeleton, nor the spine holding it up. Rubberface handles the laughs, and the spine is Yankee individualism. For e.g., Carrey answers ""Yes"" to the massive backlog of prayers on his C drive, and immediate chaos ensues. When he ignores the prayers and forces everyone to sort things out on their own, good things prevail. What is the message to the viewer, pray to God [who can't help you anyway] or fix it yourself.

","""Bruce Almighty"" was kind of funny, I enjoyed it in parts.  For a movie with a BIG THEME (being God, at least in Buffalo), the movie is surprisingly flimsy.  I knew this was a comedy, so I wasn't looking for a cerebral assault, the movie could have been just dumb fun (as in ""Dumb and Dumber""), but the script was too pat, the ending and resolutions of conflicts way too predictable.  Interestingly enough, Jennifer Aniston looks older than she really is (at least when this was filmed), which surprised me, don't they have make-up for that sort of thing?  Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman played well off of each other, but those scenes were too few and far between.  Oh well, every movie can't be a work of genius."

","This comedy (?) had maybe 3 good laughs in it. I'll explain why it is terribly flawed, even though it made several hundred million dollars:<br/><br/>-I am not a Jim Carrey hater, but he was totally miscast for this role. You needed more of a straight man to pull off the transformation to having the powers of God. Instead, Carrey seems only mildly different from before.<br/><br/>-The movie was for some reason set in Buffalo, but it looks to have been mostly filmed on a back lot in southern California. This was very disconcerting to me - Buffalo is a very gritty, post-industrial landscape, and blue screening a few shots of the skyline or the falls doesnt make it. And that street set looked like something out of ""Singin' in the Rain"".<br/><br/>-It had no edge, despite the whole work conflict and breakup with Anniston's character. An edge would provide better contrasts and better comedy - instead, it comes across like a rated G film with a few sexy jokes.<br/><br/>Only good thing was Morgan Freeman."

"MF210","5","0","0","30 November 2003"," Has some funny moments but is overall a mediocre film
","My Rating: ** out of ****. <br/><br/>Jim Carrey is one of the most consistently funny actor/comedian working today. He was hilarious in films like The Mask, Liar Liar, and Me Myself and Irene (to name a few). Such a hilarious performer would be welcomed in Bruce Almighty, but the Carrey that was in the films I named is not here.<br/><br/>
Bruce Almighty has an interesting premise. What would you do if you were God? The film explores this and has one hilarious moment from exploring it. That scene deals with a news broadcaster. However, thats one of the few laughs you get from this movie. The movie is 100 minutes long and that is waaaaayyyyyyy too long. <br/><br/>Jim Carrey is obviously not in top form here. His character is a brat and not very likable. Carrey does not seem to be enjoying what he is doing either. Jennifer Aniston has no chemistry with Carrey and does virtually nothing. No other actor really makes a difference either. Phillip Baker Hall is underused. <br/><br/>Like Liar Liar, Bruce Almighty has an uneven script. The Comedy was strong in Liar but weak in the dramatic areas. Carrey took advantage of the comedy parts and was consistently hilarious. However, the comedy is not really strong here, its mostly stupid and not in a good way. The drama is horrible too, much worse than Liar. At the end, the screenwriters intended for us to feel sorry for Bruce. Bruce is a jerk and the ending was very corny.<br/><br/>
The film also came off a bit selfish. Carrey's character was selfish but it was more than that. An interesting premise and one or two good laughs followed by a very weak script, uninspired performances, and an overlong running time do not mesh well."

The great supporting cast, including Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman and Steve Carell, acquit themselves nicely in fine performances. But since you, as the audience, are basically forced to empathize with a one-tone, jerk of a main character, it's very difficult to get behind the phony sentimentality of the climatic scenes.

In fact i believe that all his movies provide a unique slapstick, rubbery face humour which would be found humourous by many people. However i do believe that this movie, was less about the concept of exsistence of god, but more of how many cheap gags, and references to previous Jim Carrey movies, like the Ace Ventura and Truman Show. Let us see if you can find it<br/><br/>The concept of the movie is that an average person who has lost the faith with God, after a severe unlucky day. After his constant whinning to God, he is given by divine right, the chance to the Almighty himself. After obtaining these powers, he uses them for his own purposes, like to get the top job, and to make his wife's assets bigger. However he realises that this is not what God's job really is, and then that is where the chaos really starts.<br/><br/>The acting is OK from Jim Carrey, being the normal dude playing God. Jennifer Aniston was no different from this role in this movie and in her famous series ""Friends"". Morgan Freeman's acting was not really stretched to greater heights in this movie.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, i would say that is movie is a bit below par.

","I would definately agree that jim carrey is very funny and enjoyed all of his comedies.  I began to enjoy this one as well.  It definately had an interesting premise and good have been great.  However, after the first half hour or so of great humor it just basically went into the crapper. People simply have no idea what being omnipotent is.  It would not be difficult for an omnipotent being to do anything.  It would be simple for this being to keep track of trillions of people simultaneously let alone a few billion. It simply doesn't matter they really could do anything.  So then if you had god's powers god's job would be a piece of cake.  People don't want to believe that god in fact could end all suffering on the planet and make us all happy but for some reason he ""works in mysterious ways"" and does not do this. This movie was also unable to deal with these points and once it got to his point in the movie it became incredibly boring, corny, and just plain stupid.  Therefore I would probably recommend going to the first half hour or so of this movie and then sneaking into another theater and watching Finding Nemo which is a far superior movie despite its nature of being a kids movie."

"krumski","Null","0","0","8 June 2003"," Carrey that weight
","It would be difficult to find someone who is more in awe of Jim Carrey's talents than I am. If you want to criticize by saying he mugs and overacts, go ahead  you're right!  but he has elevated mugging to such an art form, and within that over-the-top area he applies such a precision and a finely-honed control that he makes it a thing of beauty. Anyone is free not to like him or his movies (and I understand you), but you must  MUST!  acknowledge his prodigious talent. (A good analogy might run thus: I don't particularly care for musicals, or for Gene Kelley in general, yet it simply wouldn't do to deny what an incredible and inventive performer he is.)<br/><br/>As such, I've enjoyed all of Carrey's comedies on some level; even when the story or premise is lame, he is never less than riveting and hilarious to watch. So it surprised me somewhat when, very early in Bruce Almighty, I caught myself thinking to myself two distinct thoughts: 1) `Someone else should be playing this role' and 2) `Jim seems really *desperate* up there.'<br/><br/>To tackle the second thing first: Carrey desperate. `How can you tell?' a Jim detractor might scoff. `After all, he always runs roughshod over everything in sight, and works desperately to be the life of the party.' True, but up until now he has always tended to play (in his comedies, anyhow) characters that were so over the top, and in movies that were pitched at such a heightened level anyway , that his wildness was not only at home in the material, but completely appropriate. In Bruce, he finally takes on what is essentially an `ordinary guy.' And you know what? Jim just can't do ordinary.<br/><br/>He wants to flail, he wants to scream, he wants to bounce off the walls! And as Ace Ventura, or the Mask, or even his so-slimy-he's-sublime lawyer in Liar Liar, we want him to as well. But in this movie, his rubber-faced antics were not endemic to the character, but rather seemed grafted on, in order to give the audience their `silly Jim Carrey' fix. Hence, the seeming desperation: every opportunity was taken to insert familiar schtick, whether appropriate or not (and it usually wasn't), causing it to look  for the first time  like the performer was actually doing his best *impersonation* of Jim Carrey, rather than having it all flow naturally from the situations and the character.<br/><br/>And herein we come up against the (current) limitations of Jim Carrey as a performer. He does not play well with others. In no movie I have ever seen of his does he do an even adequate job of being an ensemble player. The other actors exist for him simply as props, not as people to play off of or draw inspiration from (yes, even in his so-called `dramatic' films  which is why none of them were any good, save for The Truman Show, which had masterful directing and an indestructible premise going for it). That being the case, he cannot simply settle back into a character and take part in the ebb and flow of a scene  he perpetually feels a need to `make something happen' and so strains, even against the grain, to be big, brassy and memorable. And as I've said  this is no crime when applied to the type of human cartoons he has heretofore played. But when it's done in the service of someone who's supposed to come across (at least nominally) as a real person, it feels fraudulent in the worst kind of way.<br/><br/>I would have enjoyed this movie more (for, it does have a good premise and some clever bits) had the lead character been played by someone like Ben Stiller or Matthew Perry (on the young side) or, say, Tim Allen or Bill Murray (on the older side) - someone who can balance humorous riffs against a capacity for both subtlety and self-deprecation. (Actually, it would have been most perfect for the 80s version of Tom Hanks, who was capable of infusing yuppie smarm into a character, yet mixing in just enough of an essential sweetness to keep him sympathetic. And, of course, hilarious. Will we ever see that Tom again?)<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as God, though, is a hoot. Yeah, I could really get *BEHIND* a Heaven that had him in charge! In the scenes with him and Carrey, he just wipes the floor with ol' Jim; it's like he's giving an object lesson to the young whippersnapper in how you get laughs while remaining composed, and not relinquishing your essential humanity (or, in this case, divinity).<br/><br/>I don't know, man. If I were giving career advice to Jim Carrey, I'd tell him to either play to his strengths by sticking with the loony, larger-than-life roles  or, if he really wants to stretch and be serious (even if it be `serious comedy' such as this), then he needs to settle down and learn how to truly interact with other people. Far be it from me to clip his wings  I love him in the stratosphere!  but if he's determined to expand his repertoire, then he needs to develop a new set of skills. Enough awkward hybrids like Bruce Almighty, and he'll be yesterday's news."

","Jim Carrey, returning to comedy after his most recent feat with THE MAJESTIC (which was a great film) has not created his most memorable performance, but this one comes a lot closer than some of the others.<br/><br/>LIAR LIAR was his best work to date. ME, MYSELF & IRENE comes next. So, I guess we could place BRUCE ALMIGHTY a couple notches about THE GRINCH. It comes close to LIAR LIAR is story and context, but the story is just not juicy enough. Instead of having messages of understanding that deal about the problems of everyday life (as in LIAR LIAR), BRUCE ALMIGHTY creates messages about the understanding of religion and messages about god. I am not Christian, not in the least, but I was still able to watch BRUCE ALMIGHTY and not get completey sidetracked and bothered by the religions notions and humor. I thought a lot of it was completely hilarious.<br/><br/>Then there are the religious people. There are the kinds of religious people that can watch movies like this and laugh at the jokes and can understand that their god most likely has a sense of humor and can take a few jokes. I mean, I'm sure that their god wouldn't be happy with films like END OF DAYS or STIGMATA, but that's too bad. But, then there are the kind of religious people that could watch this same movie and not crack a smile the entire time. Why? Because their religion has become so big a part of their life, that it practically *is* their life. For some people, it is, but the average church-goer whose life is totally controlled by religion, that person will not find this movie appealing. I say to that person, ""It's just a movie, crabass! Lighten up!"".<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston, taking the place of Maura Tierney from LIAR LIAR is good as she appears to have walked in the role, open and with enthusiasm. Other cast members, Philip Baker Hall (who just always looks tired) and other supporting members mostly have the same amount of eagerness to be working with the great Jim Carrey in a film.<br/><br/>Director Tom Shadyac returns from DRAGONFLY (which was a very good movie, no matter what other people say) to go back to comedy as well. After collaborating with Steve Odekerk (KUNG POW!: ENTER THE FIST) on PATCH ADAMS, Shadyac got a taste for comedy. Carrey and Odekerk also collaborated with Shadyac on ACE VENTURE: WHEN NATURE CALLS. Still, BRUCE ALMIGHY doesn't top Carrey and Shadyac's best (LIAR LIAR) but comes a lot closer than the others have. Carrey doesn't have his usual trademark face-making, weird noise making, talking-out-of-his-ass feature, voice changing and other stuff from previous films, but there is enough funny dialogue and there is a scene like the ""noise-making"" feature but it isn't Carrey who does it. Still funny. Avoid Jim Carrey's older works. You can see BRUCE ALMIGHTY because it is still a good film. It is still a step backwards (a very small step backwards) but hopefully he will only get better with time.<br/><br/>BRUCE ALMIGHTY: 4/5."

","After Jim Carrey's unsuccessful attempts to create a serious acting career with films like `The Majestic,' and `Man on the Moon,' he has decided to return to his old brand of slapstick humor in the new film `Bruce Almighty' from director Tom Shadyac (`Patch Adams'). Unfortunately, the film lacks an element that audiences love Jim Carrey for-comedy. The movie's highest points have already been seen in the trailers for the film. Ironically enough, audiences seemed most amused by those same jokes: the dog using the toilet, Carrey stepping in a pothole, etc. It just goes to show that most comic films are nothing more than rehashed, simple jokes, rather than something that is actually funny. `Bruce Almighty' is the story of a man named Bruce (Carrey), who hates his life. He's a reporter who gets the crap jobs at his station, and it seems like the whole world is ignoring his talents. His negative attitude is even starting to affect his relationship with his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston). After loosing his job, Bruce starts to blame God for his lot in life. Low and behold, God (Morgan Freeman) shows up and gives Bruce all of his powers. Naturally, Bruce indulges in all the incredible abilities that God gives him and his life starts to improve. But what Bruce doesn't realize is that being God involves a lot more than improving his own life; he needs to help others who truly need it, as well. The plot is as trivial as they come. After about the first hour, some people may want to leave the theater. But things start to turn in favor of the film towards the last half-hour, as the film takes on a deeper, more meaningful tone. Ergo, the last thirty minutes of `Bruce Almighty' proves to be its own saving grace. Carrey is a great comedian, but one can't deny that the one-liners and old jokes are becoming boring. Instead of `alrighty then,' we now have `b-e-a-utiful.' The film isn't devoid of some original jokes, however. One scene shows Bruce on the rise in his ratings in which he earns the title 'Mr. Exclusive' because he finds the body of Jimmy Hoffa. Another scene shows Bruce doing an interview when all of a sudden, a meteor hits the earth in the background and since he's the only reporter around, the story becomes his. But when a film runs for 94 minutes and all it can depend on upon are moments of humor, it shows that someone should go back to the drawing board and start over. Shadyac is a fair director whose primary claim to fame have been comedies. Shadyac's `Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' was Carrey's first hit comedy, pushing him into the public eye. Shadyac's problem though is that all of his comic films are alike-they involve characters that are unhappy with their existence and through a blend of humor and emotion, they rise above themselves to become better people. Nevertheless, this scenario is old. If Shadyac wants to be remembered as a really good director, he needs to become more diverse in the film's he chooses. The only dramatic film that he's done to date has been 'Dragonfly' which starred Kevin Costner.<br/><br/>`Bruce Almighty' has proven to be a big hit at the box-office. Perhaps most people just want the same thing over and over when they see a film. If this is what you are interested in, `Bruce Almighty' is the right ticket for you. If not, rent something that is actually funny like `Best in Show' or `The Naked Gun.'  **1/2"

","Who would of thought we'd live to see the day that Jim Carrey...the godfather of comedy would snap out of his trance and go back to his roots? With the release of Bruce Almighty, Carrey fans can rejoice and yell with utmost confidence, ""No more Truman-Magestic Crap!!""  Carrey, after proving to the world he can be a serious actor, finally has decided to go back to just being the ""allrighty-then"" guy we all miss and love.  Remember the good ol' days of Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber, and the Mask?  Those were the golden days when Carrey was at his prime.  And although Bruce Almighty isn't the greatest moral epic that's come around, it's a milestone for Carrey fans. I won't go into detail about summaries of the movie, except I will speak of the moral issues I encountered durring its viewing.  For one, the movie sort of pokes fun at God and what he stands for.  Now I know that in the end, Bruce learns his lesson and realizes the greatness of God and that love is pure, but durring the trip, he does perform some offenisve manuevers.  One of that being that shortly after the ""becomes"" God, he goes to have premarital sex with his girlfriend...a thing which God sternly condems. Not only will this offend many, it might draw away from Carrey's fanbase. Although me being a strong and loyal Carrey fan, will not sway, I long for the days of old.  Will Carrey go back to his real roots and be the guy we miss?  Lets hope the cookie crumbles that way."

","Being a fan of Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, and Morgan Freeman, I went to see this film with high hopes.  After all, any movie with Freeman as God has to be pretty good, right?  Perhaps not.  While Freeman did once again fail to let me down, Carrey's performance was below average.  However, when given a script that wasn't all that spectacular, one man can only do so much. Perhaps had I looked a little closer to see that Steve Oedekerk had been involved in the script, whose other cinematic failures include Kung Pow (also known as The Dumbest Movie in Existence), I wouldn't have been let down that much.  Carrey was the best he could have been, but there's only so much he could do to save this.

Morgan Freeman was rather God-like and wise.  Jennifer Aniston was cute, but equally as neurotic.  But Steve Carrel stole the show whenever he was on screen.

I get the feeling he wasn't sure quite how to play this one, and as a result his character comes across as a little schizophrenic, jumping from the aforementioned Truman to Ace Ventura at the drop of a hat. However the farcical comedy is kept to a minimum and this works to the movie's benefit.<br/><br/>I didn't find it hilarious, but it was an enjoyable, fun film to watch. Not one of Carrey's best, but not a stinker either. Morgan Freeman gave a most restrained (I suppose dignified is a better word) performance as God and Jennifer Aniston wasn't too bad as Carrey's love interest.<br/><br/>Not destined to be a blockbuster (but then, some blockbusters shouldn't be, in my opinion) but a solid enough film and a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours."

","Bruce Almighty is the best Jim Carrey work since The Truman Show, and was a pleasant surprise after some of his recent ""Hey Hollywood - look how good I can act!"" box office disappointments.  It's great to see Jim recognizing and embracing his strengths.  He won't get an Academy Award but the film itself will last longer than many of the ""awarded films"" of the Academy.  He is at the top of his form in this most recent film - it's like the return of an old friend.<br/><br/>Carrey, Freeman, and Aniston all do a great job together - comfortable in their comedy roles, superb comic timing, and obviously having fun together but without the ""hey mom - look how funny I am"" type of comedy.  A real surprise was Steven Carrell as Carrey's nemesis (Carrell of The Daily Show fame), who walked away with some the best and funniest scenes of the film. I laughed harder at Carell than anyone else in the past three years.<br/><br/>I can foresee the religious nuts in the US will be up-in-arms over the treatment of God, but the bottom line of the film is true to all major theological beliefs - we are masses of protoplasms trying to get through our short lives by exercising our free will.  Without Married With Children t o complain about, this will likely become a target of people with misplaced priorities (who know the types - men adorned in gold watches on Sunday morning and late nigh television, selling prayers to God).  And, again, about 0.5% of the country will care and 80% of the media will report it.<br/><br/>The bottom line: this a purely entertaining film, each audience member laughingly wondering what they would do, and a feel-good feeling at the movie conclusion.  A walk down any major street in America has to confirm that God has a tremendous sense of humor.  What better comic genius to remind us of that than Jim Carry.<br/><br/>Thanks again, Jim -- it's GREAT to have you back!!"

Morgan Freeman was just right as God.  Jennifer Aniston had some good moments.  I miss Steve Correll on ""THE DAILY SHOW!""<br/><br/>I like director Tom Shadyac's choices of movies.  He also did LIAR LIAR, PATCH ADAMS, and THE NUTTY PROFESSOR.  In all three of those and in Bruce Almighty, he takes a big comedy star and tells a human story with him.  A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references. I only remember three specific biblical references and they were the three funniest parts of the whole movie.  My guess is that the first few drafts of the screenplay had more biblical references, but they were cut out because the producers were afraid of offending people.

It's not long before Bruce realizes God's work isn't as easy as he thought.<br/><br/>While it's true that many funny scenes were given away during the trailers, that didn't detract from the overall enjoyment derived from the movie.  And although Bruce Almighty is not a laugh-a-minute, it does have it's hilarious moments.  However, coupled with the humor is a more serious and heartfelt message which is delivered unoffensively and without being over the top. I'd say the only real drawback for me was the predictability of this movie. But even with the predictability, the movie was no less enjoyable and worth watching.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Jim Carrey did a splendid job as being jerky, rude, whiney, pitiful, kind and caring all in one.  Furthermore, it's quite nice to see his ability to do more serious work shine through with the necessary bits of comedic relief.<br/><br/>All in all, Bruce Almighty is a movie I would recommend...especially if you enjoy comedy with a side of serious.

Being a pretty strait-laced protestant, their's nothing worse than bad Christian bashing joke. All I have to say is Ha Ha look at that dirty pagan going to hell and I get the last laugh. That's why a film like Bruce Almighty works for me.  It's an attack on silly humans not on God.  Those silly human who destroy their lives and blame it on the Almighty.  It's a morality play with laughs.<br/><br/>        Bruce Nolan(Jim Carrey), our hero, is a local interest news reporter in Buffalo with dreams of the anchor seat.  Except his arch rival Evan Baxter (The Daily Show's Steve Carrell) looks to be next in line as the new head anchor.  When Bruce's boss Jack sends him out to cover a story, his dream job is given to Baxter and it sends Bruce into a hilarious tail-spin, which in the end, has him screaming out to God (Morgan Freeman) Spite Me. Instead God gives him a job.  Bruce gets to be God for the week, and the rest of the film answers the question what would you do if you were given all God's powers. Jim Carrey's screen persona has grown up, he can't go back to Ace Ventura, so his performance while bordering on brilliant, is reigned in. You almost wanted more from him, to kick up a notch, and it doesn't. Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend is sweet and adequate, but she could have been played by anyone, and the scripts asks very little for her to do. Steve Carrell is great as bit player.  He's probably the funniest guy out there and his anchor desk sequence, is the funniest scene in the whole film. I just wish comedies didn't feel it necessary to be filled with mellow-drama.  I wish movies could be silly for silliness sake, but unfortunately BRUCE is full of those needless scenes of fake drama for filler.  Come on Guys.

My jaw was sore from laughing at Bruce Almighty.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's latest comedy is about a goofy TV news reporter who's mad at the world after he's passed over for the News Anchor job that he so desperately wanted at his TV station. So mad that he seems to forget about the great life he has with his girlfriend, so mad that he directs his attention to God, whom he accuses of doing a crappy job. This time, God (Morgan Freeman) decides to fight back, temporarily giving Bruce his job while he takes a vacation.<br/><br/>Jennifer Anniston is great as Bruce's live-in girlfriend, the aptly named `Grace,' and the rest of the cast is dead-on too. All pistons seem to be firing in this one. Although I did not actually read the script, I can tell it was extremely well-worked. No stone was left unturned, as they say. And why shouldn't it be? The writers are seasoned veterans who've banged around the comedy trenches for years. We're talking Seinfeld, Newsradio, SNL, Politically Incorrect, The Late Show with David Letterman, trust me, your funny bone is in good hands.<br/><br/>If you give any thought to the set-up I just laid out, you can tell that Bruce is probably going to screw things up pretty badly, maybe lose the girl, maybe get the girl back, all that jazz, learn a few things about himself, but this film reminded me of why Hollywood still makes the best movies, yeah, I talk a lot of trash, but we got the world's number as far as movies go.

You see, Bruce is a wacky news guy who thinks he wants to be a respected, serious news anchor, but his real talent lies with making people laugh as the wacky news reporter, and he was great at it. If any of you saw the The Majestic (not a bad movie, mind you, but it was syrupy enough for a truck load of pancakes) which was his foray into a more straight, dramatic role, you might have found yourself wishing Jim would concentrate on doing what he does best, and it's no small feat, putting smiles on millions of faces who need one. Maybe he's gotten that serious anchor man out of his system, frankly, they're a dime a dozen, but true gut-busters like Jim Carrey don't grow on trees.<br/><br/>-Mil Peliculas<br/><br/>Don't forget to check out The Masked Movie Snobs website."

","`Bruce Almighty' will sweep the Academy Awards with a record 14 Oscar wins! It will surpass `Titanic' as the highest grossing film of all time! Jim Carrey's illustriousness will be at such a supreme level that he will announce his presidential candidacy for the 2004 White House playoffs. Almighty then! These grandeur fantasies would only transpire if the filmmakers (Carrey included) would possess the powers of God. That very same premise is the paramount ingredient in Carrey's new laugh riot `Bruce Almighty'. Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps. God, heavenly played by Morgan Freeman, grants Bruce the `Gift of God'(his powers) in order to challenge him if he can do God's job any better. Obviously, Bruce gets `carreyed' away with his newfound blissful faculties and uses them selfishly. Carrey is back in his habitual almighty comedic form in `Bruce Almighty'. Jennifer Aniston was not `mis.pittiful' as Bruce's girlfriend. However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time! `Bruce Almighty' is not the most in-depth Carrey film, but it is still an almighty chuckling exhibition of `Carreyism'! **** Good"

","I wanted a pee-my-pants Jim Carrey laughfest (like the first time I saw Dumb and Dumber), but it didn't happen.  It doesn't help that some of the funniest snippets have already been aired on TV a few hundred times, so when I saw them in the actual film they just weren't funny anymore (ie: doggy on pot, girl's skirt flying up, parting of the tomato soup, clothes flying off before sex, etc.). However, the movie does deliver and I wasn't too disappointed.  Morgan Freeman is God!  That was totally cool, cuz he is perfect in the role, and the only theologically incorrect line that I could sniff out was the part about him being on vacation during the Dark Ages.  Funny, but not true if you're a Bible believer (God never sleeps...but maybe he takes a vacation?, I hope not.). Had a good time at the movies, but not rolling in the aisles. I give it an 8/10."

","""Bruce Almighty"" is a lot like Jim Carrey's other projects. Which isn't to say it isn't funny, but it is quite recycled and doesn't pun some of the things it could and should have. Now don't get me wrong, it is anything but boring, and anything but unfunny...but it is a lot like his other projects. A funny down-on-his-luck loser (""Dumb and Dumber"") gets a supernatural power (""The Mask""), and in the end wins back the girl (""Ace Ventura"") and makes a good name for himself (""Me, Myself and Irene"").<br/><br/>But in the same context, it is more clever and thought-provoking than his other projects. <br/><br/>Jim Carrey plays Bruce, a generally happy, soon-to-be-married man who desperately wants to be a news reporter. Unfortunately, he ends up being fired from his job, and when this happens, he curses God. The next day his pager beeps, and Bruce calls up the number. He is given instructions on where to drive to. He follows them and ends up finding God's temporary headquarters.<br/><br/>God is a black man (Morgan Freeman) surprisingly enough. I like Morgan Freeman, so I won't get into the racial technicalities. Anyway, God gives Bruce his powers for one week to see how well he can handle being the master of the earth, and immediately afterwards Bruce finds he has more than odd capabilities.<br/><br/>However, much is the case with most things, Bruce finds his world also shaken by his newfound powers. He has to answer prayers, for one thing, and his relationship with Grace (Jennifer Aniston) starts to suffer due to his ever-growing greed. In the end, Bruce starts to realize it's not so easy being God.<br/><br/>""Bruce Almighty"" is a very engaging, sweet, and harmless film, but like I said before, it is so much like Jim Carrey's other films that he seems to be making an Adam Sandler mould out of his career. One of the things I liked so much about ""Groundhog Day"" was how it showed what your average Joe would do given the power to repeat one day over and over and over again. ""Bruce Almighty"" has a very interesting and original plot, something uncommon for a comedy these days, but it unfortunately doesn't show Bruce using his newfound powers as much as he could have.<br/><br/>But regardless, the scenes where Bruce is experimenting not only entertain you, but actually make the time fly by. I really enjoyed this movie. It isn't exactly as great as it could have been, but I don't think that was the intention. Learning from their mistakes on ""The Majestic,"" Jim Carrey (and ""Bruce Almighty's"" filmmakers) achieved their goal of making a thoroughly entertaining, if somewhat repetitive film that doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't: A Jim Carrey movie. Yes, they could have made something more interesting, dramatic, serious and hilarious, but I don't think that's what the Jim Carrey audiences want, and I think that the filmmakers are smart, in a way, for paying attention to this.<br/><br/>4/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

We are clearly meant to sympathise with Bruce and find him fundamentally decent, but the character is whiny, self-obsessed and petulant. Jennifer Aniston is completely wasted as his girlfriend, in a part that is criminally under-written, and the movie's tone veers uncomfortably between slapstick and sentimentality.<br/><br/>The film's problem is that it's too formulaic.

Problems arise all over the world due to Carrey's selfish use of his powers. In the end, can he fix the difficulties he has created? ""Bruce Almighty"" is an economically heavy film that cost a small fortune to make, but no money was spent on the really important things. Carrey, who was so good in ""The Truman Show"", continues to choose silly projects that only look at the bottom line. Aniston and Bell fit in good in a mess like this because they are basically just television performers and this production plays more like a sitcom than a motion picture. As for Freeman, I have no clue why he is in this thing. Wants to be a comedy, but toes delicate subject matter way too much to be very funny.

If you desire a little break in the tedium and monotony of the average life lived by most Fuzzy Robots (that's You), then Humor can be your Devine Savior. That may be a lot to ask from a stupid movie and Not-So-Mighty Bruce isn't able to deliver. It doesn't realize that just by having Jim Carey involved makes it a Holy Endeavor. They stupidly have to overshadow Jim's natural comedic superpowers with humbling Almighty Power. The idea that grown people believe in a Being whose role is more vital than that of a common human is both infantile and depressing. If you believe in a higher power in a human form, you're too silly for words. If you need to believe in an all-knowing, all-powerful man-like master, then you will ALWAYS be deceived and scammed... Just like when you willingly gave up your hard earned $10 for this bit of tame, uninspired, predictable, Christian pablum.

But let me tell you I finished the movie with a sense of confusion, but not like the confusion you get if you watch a Christopher Nolan movie. This was more of a, ""so, what did I just watch?"" The plot was all over the place, I couldn't figure out if this was a story about Bruce's claim to fame as a news anchor or a love story between Grace and Bruce or Bruce's struggles with his religion. The writing was cheesy in some spots and really took away from Carrey's performance. Also, the movie got really preachy towards the climax when God tells Bruce that the true miracles were in our control and being able to do the supernatural like levitate or read minds were just magic tricks. I really did not appreciate having a lesson shoved in my face during a comedy. Oh, and what was with the homeless man holding up random signs? It really took away from the story and made it hard to catch back up. The comedy was had its moments when Carrey did what he does best and I cannot emphasize enough how great the cast was. So if you're looking for a cinematic jewel, I would look somewhere else (like Good Will Hunting, the best movie of all time and is also on Netflix), but you will enjoy this as a family or friends movie or if you just have no other movies to watch."

Also, His choices in who to endow with powers are often ridiculous as well. Elisha is one such example. The Cast: Jim Carrey is a five star actor as always, and Morgan Freeman is amazing as well of course. The only real issue I have is the God in the movie. I'm guessing the writers didn't actually read the Bible when drafting God's character because the God mentioned in the Bible isn't any where near as friendly as Freeman's portrayal.

","This film is the best film Jim Carrey has ever made. Carrey did not have his usual face making stuff in this film. He was both funny and sad. Carrey played a reporter named Bruce Nolan. Nolan blames God(Morgan Freeman) for everything that goes wrong in his life. Then, God comes down from heaven and gives Bruce his powers. As I said before, Carrey did an excellent job.

"g00dbye_k1tty","8","1","2","13 December 2005"," See It!
","See It! I recommend you see Bruce Almighty because it is a very funny film and because it is detail oriented. In addition, the story contains many thought provoking scenes.<br/><br/>I watched Bruce Almighty at my house, and I knew that it was a romantic comedy. Also being aware that it starred Jim Carrey, I was a little prepared for the strange thematic tones of the film. It also stars Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Anniston who both add a refreshing realism to the film with their excellent acting.<br/><br/>I recommend you see Bruce Almighty because it is a very comical film. This is a fairly obvious assumption, noting the star. But the humor does play a huge role, taking into account some of the more serious issues that are brought up in this film. These issues are evident from the very start; one of the first lines is newscaster Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) blatantly asking while being filmed for the news, ""God, why do you hate me?"" A possibly controversial and definite strong statement for an opening line and without Carrey's candor and goofy smiles this line never would have worked. Another example of the role humor plays in this film is during a scene when Grace Connolly (Jennifer Anniston), Bruce's girlfriend, urges Bruce to donate blood during her workplace's blood drive. Grace gives blood but Bruce refuses, stating, ""All that stuff just ends up in warehouse somewhere, anyway."" Later on in the film when Bruce finds himself in a hospital and owing his life to the blood transfusion he has received, Grace walks in and says softly, ""I hear all that stuff just ends up in a warehouse somewhere"", with a camera shot highlighting the blood Bruce is receiving, ""O negative"", Grace's blood type. These examples show the necessity of having the right cast to match up with each character. Bruce Almighty encompasses many genres and also demonstrates the diversity one film can display, including being funny as well as portraying a serious message. Jim Carrey's humor, along with that of other actors, takes this film up a notch from films that strive for solely a message or comedy.<br/><br/>I also recommend you see this film because it displays an amazing attention to detail. There is a certain homeless man that silently narrates the story for the audience, and his image is slipped in before every main event in the plot. In the beginning of the story this man, with the sign, ""R Ewe Blind?"" is saved from a group of thugs by Bruce Nolan, pre-God powers. In a scene directly before we witness the destruction caused by Bruce's selfish use of power, the man holds a sign, ""Thy Kingdumb come"". This sign communicates the extent to which Bruce has abused his supremacy and allows the audience to realize the damage it has caused. The attention to detail and theme is also demonstrated by the closing shot, of the homeless man with sign ""Armageddon Outta Here"". An intriguing twist thoroughly in keeping with the theme of this movie ties up the homeless man subplot in this scene, and also explains the actions of key characters. These continuities and details are what takes the film to a higher level and make it very much worth seeing.<br/><br/>In addition, the story line is thought provoking. While it is in no ways subtle, the plot still manages to engage the audience intellectually. What is really going on here? What are all of these scenes supposed to communicate to me? These were a couple of the questions I continually asked myself while viewing, and throughout the film I came up with answers. A film that engages the audience in this way is the kind of film that I enjoy, and I believe many others enjoy films that have this connection of certain actions to precise meanings with an overall theme as the result, as well.<br/><br/>With a decisive message communicated through a series of singularly insignificant events and humorous scenes, Bruce Almighty is a film worth seeing and analyzing."

He's denied the anchor position, his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) is angry with him, and the next thing you now he's been fired. Soon, however, he starts to get paged and after awhile he calls the number.<br/><br/>God (Morgan Freeman) meets Bruce in an empty building and after a hilarious sequence of 'how many fingers I'm holding up' Bruce receives God's powers. The movie becomes side-splitting funny after this point and continues on until a very strange yet important ending in which the city riots over four hundred thousand lottery tickets that are all the winning ticket.<br/><br/>Carrey brings out a hilarious character in Bruce and Aniston perfect for the role of Grace. The message some may overlook that (if you believe in God or any creator) that it's not always the creators fault and job to make us happy. It is our responsibility. <br/><br/>The acting is fine in the movie. The sequences of Carrey news reporting are ingenious. The movie (in my opinion) is Carrey's best since The Truman Show (1998) and Aniston is actually acting in this film (suprising!). <br/><br/>Bruce Almighty. Starring: Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, and Philip Baker Hall. 3 1/2 out of 5 Stars."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","1","2","21 February 2004"," OK Jim Carrey comedy
","Jim Carrey hasn't been in a comedy for a couple of years; in fact, he hasn't done anything but some not-too-good dramas, so naturally, his fans were expecting a lot from the film that would mark his ""return"" to comedy. I believe that a lot of people, especially Christians, are offended by this, because of the somewhat comic portrayal of God, among other things. I didn't find said things offensive, though I can understand how some might find them offending. However, if we forget about the immediate offense some will take from the very theme of this film, and look further, we'll find an okay attempt at explaining faith and God, without simplifying or mocking. Yes, the attempt is hidden behind a lot of (so-so) comedy, but if you look closer, there are a lot of references to Christianity and perhaps even a few metaphors. It's not a particularly funny or effective comedy, in spite of director Tom Shadyac's track record with working with Carrey, but it's not awful. The jokes are found more in special effects, and situations we accept because of the power harnessed(and given that, one might have expected more interesting things to happen) by the title character... rather than Carrey's performance, the dialog or other material. I'd recommend this to any fan of Jim Carrey. Just don't expect it to be as funny as his best work(I maintain that Steve Oedekerk is unfunny and ought to stay away from Jim). 6/10"

"thefan-2","Null","1","2","10 August 2003"," Stranger than we can imagine.
","Some scientist once remarked that the universe is not only stranger than we imagine: it's stranger than we *can* imagine.  Except for the obvious fact that the word ""strange"" is a relative term, and that what might seem strange to that scientist might not seem so strange to someone else, the statement has always seemed to me to be a very reasonable expression of one man's faith in the essential zaniness of things.  (And his faith was not misplaced: the latest news is that we're all made of vibrations and have no way of knowing what it is that's vibrating.  Explains the buzzy sensation that replaces thought in the minds of politicians.)<br/><br/>Well, since the universe includes God (or is God, or is included in God, depending on your sect), then we shouldn't be surprised if God looks like Morgan Freeman.  Freeman's wonderful voice and his look of calm competence -- you *know* he knows way more than he's saying -- has left him typecast as the authority-figure in one movie after another.  Why not the Ultimate Authority-Figure in this one?  <br/><br/>And, continuing with the strangeness theme, why shouldn't the Creator pick one Jim-Carrey-like human out of all the billions of humans who demand favors of Him, and give him God-like power over one neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, USA?  And finally, why shouldn't He deliberately neglect to give that human God-like wisdom along with the God-like power?  (Because otherwise there would've been no movie, obviously.)<br/><br/>""Bruce Almighty"" tries to convey a Capra-like faith in the essential goodness of ordinary people.  Bruce easily could've sunk into Elvis-like debauchery or Stalin-like mass cruelty by the end of the week, but instead he attains a certain humility and kindliness.  Seems unlikely, I know, but that was just God picking the right person and keeping the movie a comedy instead of a tragedy.  It's not a great comedy, but I like that the theologizing and philosophizing are kept to a minimum.  And how can you not like any movie that has Jennifer Aniston in it?<br/><br/>I gather that some atheists and fundamentalists have a problem with this movie.  Atheists can always look at it as a fantasy, no different than if it had been Pan (Chris Rock) or Odin (Gene Hackman) instead of the Christian God.  Fundamentalists should remember to judge not, lest they be judged."

","There's nothing like a good comedy flick to lead in the summer, and Jim Carrey's, `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' is the best of its breed. It's formula, to be sure, and all been done before, but `Bruce' is funnier, wittier, smarter, and  odd as this might sound  more sophisticated than its predecessors. It's as though Carrey and his filmmaking partners refined the comedy/romance formula to a science, because this film does exactly what it intended to do: entertain.<br/><br/>Like previous Carrey films, `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' follows the familiar plot line where a down-on-his-luck guy gets a magical ability, fools with it for a while for fun and laughs, and after he goofs up and learns his big life lesson, walks away with the girl in the end. In fact, most Carrey comedies follow this story, most with director, Tom Shadyac at the helm. This time, Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter who always gets the humorous lifestyle stories, but never the big news stories that will give him a future as an anchorman. True, he's great at his job, has a great girlfriend, and seems to enjoy life to the fullest. But, Bruce wants more out of life. His ambitions exceed his abilities, so bad things keep happening to him. When he finally breaks down in a bout of self-pity, he blames God for all his failures. God, in response, has a meeting with Bruce, and decides to give him all the powers that He, himself, possesses. With that, Bruce goes on a wild ride of performing magical acts and other deeds of self-indulgence to `right the wrongs' that he feels were done to him. Through a series of hilarious and well-crafted gags, complete with special effects, Bruce eventually makes the big mistake that makes him realize that being God isn't all that easy, and that he was perfectly happy with his life as it was.<br/><br/>There is no question that any film that broaches the subject of God will noodle the zealots one extreme, or disgruntle the intellectual community on the other, unless it delivers poignant messages, or makes philosophically acute observations about the meaning of life. `Bruce' doesn't even attempt to address these tougher subjects; but it carefully inserts a couple one-line commentaries that make us unambiguously aware that yes, the filmmakers are avoiding the subject, and they know we're watching for it. This is done so well, in fact, that it's part of what makes the movie so appealing to a wide audience.<br/><br/>As for Carrey himself, It's true that Jim's a unique actor, and he's shown capabilities far beyond the notorious over-the-top physical comedy he's best known for. But, his funny side is still where his genius lies, and he has traditionally fostered a relationship with a rather narrow audience because of his style. So, those who are not Jim Carrey fans might find it hard to bring themselves to see `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' But, I think they'd be surprised; his humor is less reckless, arbitrary, and irrelevant to the storyline. Instead, `Bruce' is funny largely because he remains within the framework and context of the story, supporting characters, and the persona he endows in his own character.<br/><br/>To that end, all the supporting actors are perfectly cast as well. Morgan Freeman depicts `God' exactly as I'd like to see Him, and Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's girlfriend makes her relationship with him all the more believable. I should also mention Steven Carell's role as a news anchor is tearfully hilarious in his own right. He came from Comedy Central's `The Daily Show', where he also played a TV reporter for a ½-hour show that spoofs the news nightly.<br/><br/>In the end, `Bruce ALMIGHTY!' succeeds in doing exactly what it intended to do, and works at every level. Even the use of a few four-letter words didn't seem inappropriate (it's rated PG-13). I'd say it's perfect for the whole family, and a refreshing way to start the summer."

","i spoil this horrible movie:<br/><br/>A Jim Carrey movie seems to follow the same plot, in four cases out of five [much like an Adam Sandler film.]  However, I thought I would give Mr. Carrey a chance in Bruce Almighty, and see if the situation had changed at all.<br/><br/>No.  This film is just as redundant and drought-out as many Carrey films before it.  Clearly, his best work is in The Cable Guy or The Mask, and anything beyond those are just a number in the mass volume collection of which is the Jim Carrey Nightmare Series.<br/><br/>The plot basically consists of something I could have dreamed up for a grade two work of fiction.  Bruce Nolan [Carrey] is having a rough time with life, and starts cursing God over and over, until he receives a magical invitation from the big man himself, to attend a visit.  When Nolan goes to meet God [played by Morgan Freeman, and probably the only tolerable part of the film], he is given all the Heavenly and magical powers and told to do a ""better job"" than God himself.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, it's a no brainer.  From Carrey's un-charismatic relationship with his wife [Jennifer Aniston] to adventures with his work environment, the entire plot just follows cue to Carrey's other movies.  The only difference is that this time he is playing God, opposed to a pet detective or a constant liar.  But the staple of this [and all other Carrey movies] seems to be the never-ending quota of corny gags, boring jokes, and childlike funny faces, all of which had me begging the real god for that hour and a half of my life back."

","Jim carey's back to his usual acting styles, only I think we have had enough, sorry Jim - he simply overacts and overreacts. The beautiful Jennifer on the other hand has been deprived of a more expanded and decent role due her.<br/><br/>If this is about god, I do think the movie should be packed with more stunning effects and visuals. This is the time where graphics is unduly needed and unfortunately that just doesn't obtain here. The intended melodrama does not make up for this shortcoming either. Furthermore, instead of encouraging uplifting thoughts about god, it somehow infact degraded the spirit... suddenly portraying god to be having a hard time too in terms of his job (despite omnipotence and omnipresence) thereby reducing him to nothing more than a human being with supernatural powers.<br/><br/>Bestowed with god-powers, it is simply very unlikely that Bruce just did what he did. I mean, it's not the predictable course of action any person might take when bestowed with god-powers. Simply, non-intuitive. While this movie at first glance seems largely a comedy film, it is not. Buried within and between the dialogues is the unmistaken pursuit of trying to squeeze tears from our eyes and worst, attempting to impart (teach!) a moral lesson. This happens in the last 1/4 of the film and it just becomes forced ""ear-candy"" bordering on mawkish sentimentality. Crap.<br/><br/>This movie falters on the logical and collapses on its own premises and ambitions. A 2/4 for poor. Not recommended except if you liked Patch Adams too."

He made the most of the divine powers he was granted, naturally with hilarious consequences. Morgan Freeman was also marvelously cast as the caring, really fantastic guy that we'd all like to see at the helm of the universe.<br/><br/>The problems started to occur as the film wound to a close. God forbid (no pun intended) we should just have a fun film which could entertain us for a few carefree hours. No, we had to get the moral, the earlier great ideas were drowned in sugary sweetness, and Carrey added to it with the horrible moralising that truly ruined Liar Liar.

"rosscinema","4","1","2","28 June 2003"," Film squanders Carrey's talent
","Jim Carrey is a very talented actor and he has done some amazing things on camera in other films but this script never allows him to showcase his abilities. The story is about a television news reporter in Buffalo named Bruce Nolan (Carrey) who wants to get the anchor job at his station but is instead given jobs like covering the worlds largest cookie or interviewing someone at Niagara Falls. He feels that his life is not going the way he expected and after several bad luck incidents he is blaming God for ignoring his needs. He lives with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) and she dreams of marrying Bruce. Bruce keeps getting paged and finally he calls the number that tells him to go to an address. He goes and meets God (Morgan Freeman) who tells him he is sick of Bruce blaming him for his problems so he is being given all his powers while he goes on vacation. Bruce and his new found powers go out and try to fix some of the things in his life. He teaches his dog to use the toilet and he also gives Grace bigger breasts. He also uses the powers for some unexpected happenings when he is reporting like a comet coming to Earth or discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body! Bruce tries to make everyone happy (Especially himself) but loses Grace when she see's Bruce's co-worker Susan (Catherine Bell) kiss him at a party. The films story should have given Carrey all sorts of opportunities to use his natural comedic gifts but unfortunately it does not. Instead, the script only gives him opportunities to react to humorous situations going on around him. The story is simple and silly but thats okay. The story of ""Liar,Liar"" was silly also but that script gave Carrey the chance to show some of his best physical comedy put on film! This script wastes the enormous talent that it had to embody the story. This film does have some genuine laughs in it like when Bruce uses his power to make the news anchor sputter gibberish on the air or when he turns on Grace before a night of lovemaking. Only in a few moments do we see Carrey's real talent and the one scene that stands out is when he does his Clint Eastwood impersonation while in his car. Thats Carrey using his natural gifts but these are only fleeting moments. I wasn't a fan of the ""Ace Ventura"" films but they did one thing right. They allowed Carrey to explode with his natural comedic talent. This film doesn't do that. Instead, the script harness's Carrey and all he has to do is react to the situations at hand. Film does deliver some real laughs but the rest of the time I was waiting to see if Carrey could emerge from the contrived story. Unfortunately, he does not!"

It's a pity it doesn't run with the concept a little more, and the love interest with Jennifer Aniston strictly follows type. It has it's moments, and despite an occasional reliance on tired jokes (look! A dog p***ing on the furniture! How innovative!) there aren't too many times where Carrey becomes too annoying. If you like his stuff then you'll lap this up, and if you don't this film remains more than tolerable.

There's no question that Carrey is a genius at goofy comedy, but even genius must be applied appropriately. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast fares much better. Morgan Freeman is, of course, magnificent as the Almighty feeling the need to teach Bruce some humility. His scenes are the best in the film.  Catherine Bell (from TV's ""Jag"") is both provocative and luminescent as the co-anchor Susan Ortega.  She gives memorable dimensionality to what could have been a caricature.  Jennifer Aniston continues to prove her mettle as a versatile and aware leading lady. She is perfectly aware that she is merely the obligatory lead female in Carrey's star vehicle, but puts her all into fleshing out Grace as an independent person that we care about.  Philip Baker Hall and Sally Kirkland are solid in important supporting roles while Tony Bennett has a fun cameo.<br/><br/>Given the plot's immense possibilities, I am disappointed that the movie chose to channel its energies so narrowly, but at least, in doing so, it made me laugh.

","While Bruce Almighty will probably rake in a landfill's worth of cash, it doesn't mark the trumpet-blaring, heaven's parting return to physical comedy that Jim Carrey fans (true fans, not fair-weather ones) were praying for. Certainly it goes without saying that this movie has its funny moments, as to be expected, but even then, Carrey's humor comes off as unsure at times, as if he's trying on an old pair of shoes that used to be his fave, but now betray his once confident steps. Outside of the ups and downs of Carrey's performance, Bruce Almighty fails in installing a sense of almighty bewilderment and awe with both the comedy and the subject matter: one man walking a mile in the most mighty of moccasins. There have been better God laughs in ""Oh God, You Devil,"" and even George Burns would agree to that, despite a solid, yet expected, performance from Morgan Freeman. A few special effects gimmicks can't make up for the lack of directorial imagination with this most fertile of comic ground ... I mean, come on, Carrey as God should have been the role he's been waiting to ham up his entire life. Instead of an Ace Ventura, laugh until your spleen ruptures movie, we're left with an empty spot where laughs should be.

If I had been in Tom Shadyac's shoes, I might have gone for an actor without the inherent slapstick nature that seems to accompany Jim Carrey in every film he's in. I actually think the film would have been vastly improved if Carrey would have made Bruce Nolan a little more like Truman Burbank and a little less like Ace Ventura.

It has its comical moments, but it never is as strong as ""Liar Liar"".<br/><br/>The story is original, different and has its funny side, but can be offensive for some people. It isn't offensive for me, however.<br/><br/>This film casts Jim Carrey as the Bruce Almighty of the title, who isn't that almighty as you'll see all over the movie. Morgan Freeman and the pretty Jennifer Aniston also star in this film.<br/><br/>The best scenes of the film are, in my opinion, the following: when Bruce inserts stars in the sky and pushes the moon closer to us; when he's testing his new powers at the sound of the cool song ""The Power""; when Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman are standing still on the sea and then we see Jim Carrey running above the sea. I mean, can you imagine the sensation, what would it be like if us humans could walk and run above the sea as if we were doing the same in any ordinary street? And imagine how far could we go and what we could explore...<br/><br/>Overall, it's an okay comedy but nothing special. It is, however, recommendable for those who like Jim Carrey's humor."
"leplatypus","4","1","3","13 March 2007"," For one time, Devil is missed (TV)
","This movie is about an unlucky loser (Jim Carrey) who blames God for his fate. As a try-out, God gives him his almighty powers for a while. This new god turns his love, his life, his town totally upside down to finally understand what he has to do<br/><br/>I admit: this was the movie teaser that motivates me to see the movie. But I was a bit afraid that the good jokes of the teaser could have been ""the best of"". <br/><br/>But, surprisingly, the period while Bruce is almighty is the less interesting part of the movie: the jokes are fun but his ambition & egocentrism bite the nail of the enjoyment. In other words, the script lacks here some deep sense. <br/><br/>On the opposite, the beginning of his unsuccessful life & his final revelation are more balanced: the jokes are hilarious & I care for his fighting spirit! <br/><br/>It was all the more enjoyable than i got the feeling of ""déjà-vu"": Believe it or not, last year, on 1st June, St Justin day (!), after a f#ck! day (shootings from my boss, a dear friend hangs up at phone), I came back to my accommodation, saying the same lines of that movie: ""what do you want God ?"" ""when did I act so badly to feel such pain!!!"" Then, opening my letterbox, I find a printed ad: ""You want help! Ready to help!"". Again like the movie. I didn't phoned the office, just keep the letter as a fetish luck.<br/><br/>Lately, my fate get worst but, with the help of a great collaborator, I had a revelation & make sense: bad luck, worries aren't the work of God but the work of the devil. If you believe in God, you can't ignore the devil. So my opinion is the more you stay sincere, honest, honorable, helpful, the more you signal to the bad one. You become then a first in his list of harassment. Life is thus balanced: what God gives you, Devil tries to take it back.The sign that this is a good path for thinking is that my belief (Zen) translates this also: Life changes: Be ready for that!!! <br/><br/>So, in spite of all the good fun, this comedy is unable to propose an active thinking. Its almigthy flaw is the side of bad things <br/><br/>When Bruce becomes crazy or when people riots, if god is sad, the other one should have a good laugh, because all the pure things (love, compassion) have left <br/><br/>Maybe this more profound vision in the sequel.. <br/><br/>In all cases, Jim Carrey is an enthusiastic actor. His energy is a great help to clearly understand how the character feel: When he is confused, he is madly furious; when he miss his girlfriend, he really seems pitiful<br/><br/>My conclusion would be from Pope Benoit XVI, who answers the question: ""Has God the sense of fun?"" with: ""Absolutely, but he is very subtle, the signs hard to appear, but when the pieces come together, it is a way to return for more humility!!!"""

","Fans of Jim Carrey, who enjoy him on-screen no matter what he does, will no doubt like ""Bruce Almighty"" for it is designed to be a Jim Carrey vehicle, a showcase for the actor and nothing more. He plays Bruce, an unlucky news-reporter for a Buffalo TV station who blames all his troubles on God; after a meeting with the Almighty himself, Bruce gets a chance to see how tough God's job is by being blessed with extraordinary powers. Naturally, this being a Jim Carrey vehicle, he gets silly and parts the Red Sea--actually, his tomato soup--in his soup-bowl, causes a co-worker to lose control on live television, and turns himself into a romantic stud with his girlfriend. This all works for awhile, but when prayers start piling up and Bruce makes the lazy decision to grant everyone his wish, the movie runs out of comic steam and becomes a sticky mess. Out of three-million-plus prayers answered, the troubles which quickly result seem to happen only in Bruce's town (are residents of Buffalo the only God-seeking people on Earth?). The milieu isn't Buffalo anyway, it's a distinct movie back-lot, and the artificial mechanics of this plot matched with the phony look can make one defensive and angry--but only if he or she isn't a Jim Carrey die-hard. It's a movie assembled by agents and managers and stars, and fans will no doubt enjoy it. *1/2 from ****"

","Okay, I won't keep it a secret. I am not a fan of Jim Carey and think most of his films are designed for a very undiscerning audience (especially teens). Subtle, they are NOT! However, I did mildly like BRUCE ALMIGHTY--mostly because Carey's usual ranting and raving is under some control. This still isn't Masterpiece Theater, but it's a far cry from DUMB AND DUMBER or ACE VENTURA!! I think what I liked best about the film (other than restraining Carey) was that this film had an actual plot and a message--and surprisingly enough, one that probably WON'T offend most religious people despite its premise. Bruce is a self-centered jerk who tends to blame God for his problems instead of looking at his own contributions to his predicaments. Again and again, he says it's all God's fault that his life is a mess. Apparently, God has a sense of humor and approaches Bruce with a proposition--""if you can do better then the job is yours!"" As an almighty deity, Bruce does not do that many funny things that you probably didn't see in the film's previews a few years back. But, he does learn a valuable lesson and the film is pretty entertaining, though slight in its aspirations. A very good time-passer, but not as interesting or having lasting appeal like THE TRUMAN SHOW."

","Jim Carrey's always been something of a contortionist. His movies have been uneven and not anyone's favourite but as the writing's got better he's come to the fore.

And sticking with that movie a second, the story is cute and it's capable of holding together.<br/><br/>Now cut to this 'gem'. Carrey's contortions are replaced - in some places augmented - by digitally created special effects. We need this? We want this? When Carrey's a talent like he is on his own?<br/><br/>Maybe the demographic for Jim Carrey movies is going down the years film after film. Maybe this one is for nine year olds in Tennessee. Whatever: it makes no sense.<br/><br/>This one has so many plot idiosyncrasies and outright contradictions it's not funny. So you have to ask: if the story makes no sense, what right do the studio people have asking you to like it? And if they can't stick to the same suspension of disbelief logic throughout, how are you supposed to take it seriously?<br/><br/>Watching the closing credits is a chore. They go on forever. There are hundreds upon hundreds of people involved in the making of this film. And they all seemed ostensibly to do a good job. Why then can't one demand the same thing from the screenwriters and the idiots at the studios who come up with these ridiculous ideas?<br/><br/>Hollywood might be only one way of making movies and telling stories, but the people there are professional. Why is it then that the really great movies are always the ones that do not come out of Hollywood?<br/><br/>Why can't these idiot studio moguls buzz off and let the writing talent they hire do their job like everyone else?<br/><br/>There are so many good stories out there waiting to be written. This is not one of them.<br/><br/>PS. They're working on a sequel? The last to leave Hollywood please turn out the lights. They can't afford to pay the bills there anymore.

I felt that this movie was one of his best yet, it has everything, romance, some fantasy and hilarious comedy that had both my sister and I laughing throughout the film. This film is definitely one of Jim's best and as well as being hilariously funny it has a deep meaning to it and has quite a powerful moral which makes it entertaining and a good movie for young and old.

","OK, I love this movie. I like that it has a deep spiritual message that is conveyed through simple symbolism. Everyone of us is trying to fight back and have some resistance against Life's will that is naturally for our good. This movie is just for everyone. Rarely does anybody stop fighting life back. We should all submit to Life's will.<br/><br/>I guess this movie succeeds in bringing the message clear and effective without mixing it with any sort of religion. I give it 10/10 for:<br/><br/>1.

","Some people say that comedians should do more serious roles. ""Bruce Almighty"" proves that Jim Carrey works best in comedy. He plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who can't make it to anchorman. That is, until he meets God (Morgan Freeman), who gives him divine powers for a week (with a few precautions). So, Bruce uses his new abilities to take revenge on all who have wronged him, including giving one man an unpleasant experience with a monkey. But Bruce also figures out a way to make his fiancée Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston) really fall for him.<br/><br/>The whole thing is completely silly in the same way as ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"", ""The Mask"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"". But mark my words, no part of ""Bruce Almighty"" is ever dull. God bless Jim Carrey!"

"Citizen_Cam","6","1","3","28 March 2005"," Is it a comedy or not, guys?
","There are two directions in which you can take a movie with the premise of Bruce Almighty. That premise, in which a mortal man is endowed with all of God's powers, is certainly an intriguing one, and lends itself to one direction or the other. Either you can make it a wild, outrageous comedy, with the comic premise being that the hero can do whatever he chooses without consequence, or you can make it a drama about the burden of power and show that every action does have a consequence. Bruce Almighty unwisely tries to do both at the same time. The hero of the story is Bruce (Jim Carrey). Now, to me, his life seemed OK; he has a job as a reporter for a Buffalo news agency, a beautiful girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) and enough money to see him through, given the amount of fancy stuff in his house, at any rate. But Bruce isn't happy - he wants to be the network anchorman, for example. When everything in his life starts to go wrong; the office jerk gets the anchor job, Bruce cracks up on air and gets fired, he curses God for allowing all this to happen. And before you know it, God turns up, in the form of Morgan Freeman. God offers Bruce a deal: have all His powers and see if he can do better. For a while after he gets them, Bruce does all kinds of crazy things, and for that while you think the movie is taking the outrageous, wild direction, thus far seen in many of Carrey's other films, notably Ace Ventura. He parts his soup, for instance. He enlarges his girlfriend's breasts. He brings the moon closer to the earth for romantic purposes. He gives his un-housebroken dog the ability to use the toilet. And, most amusingly, he sabotages the jerk news anchor's first time on-air, making him spout gibberish. But then, suddenly, halfway through the movie, the jokes all stop. It suddenly becomes a drama, with the usual maudlin scenes, and the usual girlfriend leave/emotional crisis/win her back/crying scenario results. By the end, I was waiting for Jimmy Stewart to show up. I've seen all that before. There is, of course, a moral, which is jammed down the throat so hard it comes out your rear (not unlike a monkey in one of the film's more humorous scenes). Bruce Almighty fails because of identity crisis. It can't decide what it wants to be - comedy or drama. The cast make a good fist of it; Carrey has already established he can act, in films like The Truman Show, but here he shows that he can still flail his limbs with the best of them. Freeman is well cast as God, and does a nice job of being sufficiently divine. Aniston is less impressive, but not unbearably so. The jokes the film does have, heavily concentrated in the first half, are often hilarious. I just wish they'd gone on longer. Good-o-meter rating: 6/10"

Even in ""Hard Rain"", he was a criminal, but one with character. I really liked that. I've enjoyed every role he has played. His performance made the entire movie enjoyable. Thank you, Mr. Freeman. I don't think it's possible for an actor to play such good parts without those parts truly being some part of his character. Believing that, I also believe you must be a wonderful person to know. I hope you have siblings. You'd be a wonderful big brother! Trust me... that's a compliment."""

","Sometimes watching the deleted scenes on the DVD of a movie leaves you hankering for the film that could have been and suddenly disappointed with the film you had thought you liked. Like the DVD for John Dahl's ""Joyride""(2001), the DVD package for Tom Shadyac's ""Bruce Almighty"" reveals a whole other movie that was shot, but underperformed at the test screenings and got chopped down to a simplistic version of itself. Don't be confused, ""Bruce"" still amply earns it's 8 of 10 rating and that's an 8 tending toward 9 due to the reasonable attempt to discuss philosophical issues amid Jim Carrey's rubber faced mugging and fart jokes. The plot: ""what would happen if you got to/had to be God?"" is rife with possibilities and the finished film reels like a Marx Brothers telegraph of a Tolstoy novel. Pretty darn good, but Oh what could have been. Watch the deleted scenes and the ""Method of Jim"" reels on the extras portion of the DVD then pause to imagine the film that ""Bruce Almighty"" was before ""Shady-hack"" went to chopping. It's an editing job that trades divine for dividend."

"dromasca","7","1","3","7 February 2004"," God as mainstream comedy item
","I like Jim Carrey, and consider him the big comedy star of the American screen nowadays. Yes, he does remind us Jerry Lewis, but this is a tradition that goes back even farther, to the days of the mute comedy, and I do not find this a problem - quite the contrary. 'Bruce Almighty' is a(nother) comedy about God being busy, or just tired, and relenting some of his powers to earthy creatures. The lucky winner (or victim) is the very human TV reporter played by Jim Carrey, a typical mix of egocentrism and good sentiments, as any of us is. Some of the gags are really good, and the film develops well for the first two thirds of the time. No deep philosophy, but decent morality in the clothes of good comedy. Unfortunately, in the last third the movie really goes in the very center of the mainstream, trying to make happy all the family viewers in the most fundamentalist homes. This does not help the level and impression the movie makes as a whole. Jim Carrey is good as always, Jennifer Aniston prepares her post-Friends career and may catch soon the place that Meg Ryan just left free as the US cinema sweetie of the decade. My grade for this film is also 2/3 -  or 7 out of 10 on my personal scale."

","I was seven years old when I saw the first Ace Ventura after watching Jim Carrey on In Living Color.  Ever since then, I've seen every single one of his movie (yes, even The Majestic) and he's become my favorite actor.  I think all his movies were great, even the Cable Guy.  Don't get me wrong - I loved The Majestic but a lot of people were getting tired of his leap into drama.  When I saw Bruce Almighty, I knew that this long wait for the return of classic Carrey comedy was worth it.  I thought it was hilarious.  I even had flashbacks of Ace Ventura, especially from the way his hair looked. It looked like he had a lot of fun making this movie.  You can usually tell that in his best movies.  Like I said, I love all his movies, but this current entry rides the ranks of the original Ace Ventura, The Mask, Dumb and Dumber, and Liar Liar.  An instant comedy classic."

For a comedy, this gets it's even amount of laughs and fun for a watch with friends or family. I just loved Morgan Freeman playing God, he was just hilarious and perfect for the role, him and Jim did terrific together.<br/><br/>Bruce is a man who isn't having much luck in life. When his girlfriend tells him just to keep faith and pray, he has his doubts and just thinks God is a phony who can't pull it together for his people. He gets a mysterious message telling him to call God, when he denies the response, God just gets his butt over to him. He tells Bruce that he's upset at his mockery of doubting his power and ability to help people. So, he decides to teach Bruce a lesson, by letting him be God for a few days and see if he can do the job. Sounds great, right? He's having better sex, better luck in traffic, better work, just a good life in general... until, he hears the prayers by other's. ""Please, let me die"" ""I want to win the lottery"" ""Please make my life better"" ""Please"" ""Please"", it goes on and on. Bruce figures to make it easy and just says ""yes"" to all the prayers, unfortunately, everyone then wins the lottery and gets job promotions leading to riots because there isn't enough. He tries to organize his prayers, but just can't do it. When he finally realizes that he can't solve everyone's problems and knows that God can't get to everyone in time.<br/><br/>With some fun humor and a great cast, I think any Jim Carrey fan will enjoy this. It's a fun movie and just a nice drama. So, go ahead and just have a good time with the movie, who knows what more Jim Carrey has to offer? <br/><br/>8/10"
"experten","10","1","3","11 August 2003"," A masterpiece that will become a classic.
","In my opinion Dumb and Dumber is Jim Carrey's funniest movie but Bruce Almighty is his best.<br/><br/>BA is not a pure comedy like Dumb and Dumber, one that only works because of the comedic genius of Carrey (together with a brilliant Jeff Daniels).<br/><br/>BA has quite a few typical Carrey scenes that indeed are very funny, but BA is more than the sum of those scenes, it is brilliantly acted, masterfully directed and the story is very clever too.<br/><br/>BA is a feel good movie in the tradition of Stewart/Capra, enhanced by the comedy genius Carrey in top form. <br/><br/>It is very good to see Carrey back in the comedy genre, even though his more dramatic movies has been very good (Truman Show) or good but easily forgotten (the rest). Comedy is what Carrey does best and he does it like no other.<br/><br/>The casting of Morgan Freeman was perfect. He is always good, but here he is perfect. The only pity is that he will never get a Greater role :) . Jennifer Aniston was also good and it is irrelevant that she has an easy role.<br/><br/>My rating is 10, according to the IMDb rating scale of course.<br/><br/>Finally some remarks to other reviewers: If there is a God I'm sure He/ She/the Neutrum is mighty enough to take on whatever form or color God wants, no matter descriptions of God in the Bible. In front of Bruce God may have found it best to look like Morgan Freeman, in front of you God may want to look like a pink elephant. Who knows? The answer is not in the movie. The purpose of BA is not to answer teological questions or support one religious belief in front of another. (BA is based on the monoteistic belief, but that is hardly the purpose of the movie). <br/><br/>The message of the movie is not, like at least one reviewer stated, the conservative thought that we should be content with our place (other than being content we are not gods). If you have to try to find messages in a comedy movie I think they will be more like this in BA: You do not have to be content with your place, but don't expect God to fix everything for you (a more radical thought, maybe BA is unsuitable material for you americans) and there might be other things than your position that are more important. But the movie is not about sending out messages, it's purpose is to entertain and it is a success.<br/><br/>If you are looking for symbolism, messages and such you may be better off watching another kind of movie. If you don't like Carrey, Seagal or Eastwood why do you watch their movies? Does not seem very intelligent to me."

","I've not been a particular fan of Jim Carrey. Nothing would have induced me to see the ""Ace Ventura"" films, but I enjoyed his performances in ""The Mask"" and ""The Truman Show"" and he's been growing on me through television interviews. There is no doubting that the buffet-haired, plastic-faced, motor-mouthed one is a rare, if manic, talent and this movie is a showcase for his wacky style which sadly under-utilises Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston as God and girlfriend respectively. <br/><br/>As a morality tale of a man who has God's powers for a week, there are some really funny scenes here, but the plotline is far too thin and shmaltzy. It seems that - as in ""Groundhog Day"" - the conservative message is that we should be content with our lot, even if that 'only' means being a reporter of bizarre community stories on a local television station."

Does anybody still laugh at him? That man is a parody of himself and has been so for years.

","I saw this movie for a second time within 4 days of seeing it the first time, and this was because I found it so ridiculously funny. As a MASSIVE fan of Jim Carrey, it was a must see for me. I think that Bruce is a typical character for him, and you can usually always tell if he will suit the part before the film has even begun it's production! I particularly enjoyed the scene on the 'Maid of the Mist', where he doesn't even have to open his mouth and causes a lot of hilarity, the other people in the cinema were roaring at this stage. The best scene, in my opinion, was when Bruce causes Evan Baxter (Steven Carell) to go completely mental at the news desk, fantastic work from both the actors, as both of them had to work hard to look like Bruce was causing Evan to do the crazy things. I love it when Carrey does that kind of stupid thing, a little like Liar Liar. He is a credit to the world of entertainment, and I look forward to his future films. I especially look forward to 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' in 2005, having found out about the story line, it is another typical Carrey character."

Pulling faces at 40 just highlights his wrinkles.<br/><br/>On the other hand there is a childish delight at seeing Ace Ventura: TV Reporter.  The film takes a while to get going and some of Carrey's mugging smacks of overkill (or maybe desperation), but when Bruce Almighty gets the jokes right... boy does it work.  Witness Bruce influencing a rival TV man to speak in a squeaky voice during the news, or Bruce's breakdown and use of the F-word live on air.  Morgan Freeman has some fun with the role of God, but when the film stumbles under its own theological weight and turns semi-serious in the third act, things become predictable and stale when you just want Carrey to do something funny.  Aniston's role is underwritten to say the least.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty has some laugh out loud moments, but it's no classic.  Oh well - at least it's better than Shadyac's last two films."

Well, you could take some tips from the film that can proudly be crowned the year's classiest and funniest comedy.<br/><br/>The enigmatic Carrey stars as local news reporter Bruce Nolan. Though having a girlfriend to die for in Grace (Aniston), Bruce is becoming tired of his meaningless existence, and after he is rejected the job of anchor man at the news station, blames God for his demise, claiming that He has had it in for him for a while. However, hell hath no fury like the Almighty p***ed, and soon enough, God appears in the grandiose and charming form of Morgan Freeman. Bruce, as you can imagine, is not won over by His attempts to convey his almighty prowess. But soon enough, Bruce bows down before his Maker, and starts off his new job in earnest. So what would you have done? Blowing up a woman's skirt, giving Grace the most powerful `pleasurable' experience ever, and teaching his rival news anchor how to effectively `clear' your throat before every transmission, are just some of Bruce's `preferences'. Nevertheless, Bruce soon learns that and the awesome challenge that faces the Man Upstairs, isn't a walk in the park by any means, and sets out to right as many wrongs as he can, while trying to discover the true meaning of his being.<br/><br/>Audiences rarely lye, and with a Stateside gross of over $200 million, it's easy to see what the fuss is all about with this one. Carrey, wrongly criticised for his recent move away from comedy, has never been better. His performance is not only one of his effervescent and vivacious jesting loved by so many, but also recalls the sincerity and earnestness of his turns in ""The Truman Show"" and ""The Majestic"". Carrey is on screen virtually the length of the film, with his natural charisma in tow, he is effortlessly watchable. The same can be said of the other two-thirds of the films main trio. Freeman is always reliable, and here as the All-Powerful, he is as magnificent and compelling as ever. And Aniston effortlessly slips into her role, and although she has little to do at times, provides the film with its sassiness, lighting up the screen with a glow that very few present day actresses can produce.<br/><br/>
Director Shadyac proves his worth as a comedy director, managing to give the film some clever and neat guidance throughout. The scriptwriters too know their comedy, and although Carrey's input is obvious, still manage to effectively combine the slapstick with the meaningful impeccably. And although the religious undertones and the clichéd ending may put some people off, don't let it hamper one of the most enjoyable movie experiences you'll have this year. ****"

But the film is witty and humorous all the same, not the wild humor of 'Ace Ventura' or 'Dumb & Dumber', which I personally prefer.

"aireent","10","1","3","2 June 2003"," Heavenly Funny !!!
","Jim Carrey's 'Bruce Almighty' was downright hilarious and funny. The movie's heavenly entertaining.<br/><br/>This may sound like a cliché but the film somehow sends a timely message (well at least for me). Let's bring forth selfish versus selfless, almighty versus humanity and the simple pleasures life offers. Grace is a woman who totally commits herself in full support to the man she loves. A life that is considered mediocre though somehow content and living a day at a time underplays this. And in the heart of this a man named Bruce constantly whines, constantly seeks self-fulfillment and self-satisfaction. A man who upholds the I, ME, Mine principle. A man always wanting more and getting more without realizing his self-worth in giving laughter and simple joys. Yes, he is Bruce Nolan, a local Eyewitness News TV reporter in Buffalo, New York, best known for doing humorous, homespun, human interest stories. Yet this being a job doesn't carry and make him feel up in cloud nine. There's nothing wrong with making a goal and dreaming big but at the rate he's handling it? I guess not. So when he doesn't get that much-anticipated promotion he boils down on national TV and eventually gets fired. So as that 'fateful' day goes out bad, string of disasters follow through. And how does Bruce handle it? As much as he never misses to whine about it. That's what exactly he does best. So he takes it out to God when things do not happen the way he expects it to be. There he goes, blame it on the Big Man upstairs. So then what happens? God in a nondescript utility outfit beckons him and reveals himself. He then willingly obliges to endow Bruce with His powers and tells him to be in charge. Lucky Bruce you'd say. Except sometimes it's not easier as it seems. Soon Bruce discovers that being God and being in charge is more than meets the eye. Learning how to weigh consequences is indeed as paramount as to giving in to everyone's whims and desires. It entails command beyond power. And as he learns to deal with the voices in his head he realizes that getting more and wanting more aren't precisely his life's intent.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's tailored fit role as he alone does so well is perfect as the Almighty reliever. He's naturally endearing as this cocky and flamboyantly self-centered newsman. He carries himself in such charming ways his bemused and outlandish funny role. Meantime Morgan Freeman plays God in all his might as effortless as ever and somehow possesses this Omni presence that hovers mankind. Jennifer Aniston does her character well as Grace the simple and patient girlfriend of Bruce.<br/><br/>I guess Bruce is in each of one us as we challenge God from time to time and try to be in control of our lives. Only then do we trace back our humanity, trust our heart and discover real happiness. So trust your humanity to the almighty. Because after all we can all become our own miracles."
"slint70","10","1","3","31 May 2003"," Throwback movie with great special effects
","If you could take ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and add 50 million in special effects you'd be in the ballpark.  Yes Jim Carrey is funny, yes Jim Carrey is self asorbed in the beginning of the flick and yes Jim Carrey somehow gets the powers of God and Jennifer Anniston to love him.  BEAU-tiful.  This is a really good film and Morgan Freeman is perfect for the role of the Almighty. Just watch it.  SPOILERS.<br/><br/>There were a lot of great lines , like when Bruce asks God ""how do you get someone to love you without affecting free will?"" to which God replied ""Now you know what it's like in my world, if you can answer that one let me know.""  Pretty powerful stuff.  Jim Carrey represents most people in that they are searching for things that truthfully they can give anyways, like devotion and heart to their fellow man.  But  in the beginning he is most of us in that we would love to impress our significant other in out of this world ways when in fact if they truly love you this doesn't really matter. A lot of good messages in a very entertaining format.  The script is really good in my opinion and any actor could have pulled this out as Bruce but Jim Carrey and his comic talent a plenty make this a tour de force that will be up there with the greats......."

","BRUCE ALMIGHTY (2003) *** Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Catherine Bell, Steven Carell, Philip Baker Hall, Lisa Ann Walter, Nora Dunn, Sally Kirkland. High concept comedy with Carrey as a put-upon Buffalo, NY news personality who feels God is out to get him gets his ultimate complaint put to the test when He (a game Foreman) gives his powers on loan to see what he would do in His place. Laughs aplenty especially the 'monkey scene' ('nuff said; don't want to ruin it for those who haven't seen it yet), which deserves a spot in the cinematic vault. Aniston adds a fine balance for Carrey to bounce off as his long-suffering yet supportive girlfriend and unctuous jerk news anchor Carell steals the show as a victim to the suddenly pious Carrey's shenanigans by having a speaking-in-tongues fit on-air that also should be filed away in the film vault. A fine screenplay by Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe and Steve Oedekerk allow Carrey to riff with his spastic slapstick and go-for-the funny bone one-liners as well as re-uniting with director Tom Shadyac who lets Jim get his ya-yas out."
"Agent10","7","1","3","24 May 2003"," Brings up some interesting questions, and is funny too!
","Sure, Jim Carrey nearly ruined his career with The Majestic, but he returns to form with this great comedy. It also posed the inevitable question: What if Jim Carrey was God? This should have been a horror film, but that's for another movie. Nonetheless. Carrey's inexorable physical humor made this film what is is, a sweet little comedy that doesn't get too preachy. While I wanted more to happen in the last 15 minutes of the film, one can't complain about the rest of the film. To say the least, it was pure comic genius, and for all of the religious nutbags who claim this film is sacreligious should lighten up. This is nothing more than a popcorn movie with enough great visuals and plot to keep you entertained."

It has a hilarious script! Even Christians will get a kick out of this!<br/><br/>Con's: Some of the material is a bit unnecessary, like Bruce and Grace's romance scene. And some other things are just kind of disgusting, especially the monkey thing.<br/><br/>Overall: It's a hilarious movie with a good message. Check out the DVD and watch the deleted scenes and the bloopers. They're hilarious!!!"
"nvdw","4","1","4","14 April 2005"," Could someone pass Shadyac some cojones?
","(Repeated line in the DVD director's commentary: ""We cut that scene, 'cause we wouldn't want to hurt any people."") Tom Shadyac seems to have a knack for completely inoffensive, high morale, family valued, junk food comedy features: hence Liar Liar, Ace Ventura, you know the bunch. Bruce Almighty is in the same league, but fails to be funny for the entire length of the movie. Instead, it is a moralizing piece of bull that could have been so much better, if only Tom Shadyac wouldn't have listened to his stupid focus group audience.<br/><br/>Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a reporter for the Buffalo local news station, but he's fed up with making reports about low-rent, trivial subjects like he's (apparently) been doing for the last few years. Instead, his goal is to become the anchor of the news station and become Buffalo's own Walter Cronkite. When his slimy colleague Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) snitches his beloved job opportunity from under his very nose, Bruce starts a rage against God, blaming him for all the misery he's in. Consequently, God (Morgan Freeman) grants Bruce all his powers, so he can prove that he can do a better job.<br/><br/>Of course, this leads to the usual series of hilarious events, but suddenly, the script demands a more serious approach. Enough with all the mild Bible jokes, it's time for some tear-jerking morale! I don't mind the morale, but why does it take Shadyac half a movie to make his statement? There is absolutely *nothing* to laugh about in the second bit of Bruce Almighty, and that's the first reason why it fails to be a good comedy.<br/><br/>The second reason is Shadyac's enduring fear to offend people. The film would have been a lot better if only he had the bloody cojones to ignore the complaints of the ruddy focus group. How could a simple God joke be offensive, when thousands of Christians approve of a movie where Jesus Christ is beaten to a pulp for two hours (Gibson's Passion of the Christ)? The only thing I find offensive about Bruce Almighty, is the way Carrey's character behaves to his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston in a stereotype cast) and gets away with it. Just like Maura Tierney in Liar Liar, Aniston has to play a woman who simply loves an insulting, betraying, generally mistreating jerk. For that I don't blame God (for I'm not Bruce), but Shadyac. Family values, tssk."
"oyvind-17","3","1","4","16 January 2005"," Illogical, but sometimes funny
","I rarely get bothered by illogical events in movies, but this one has a few huge defects in that department. Where did the rest of the soup in the bowl go when Bruce did the split? And how come no one seemingly observed the moon being dragged towards earth? Such annoyances make ""Bruce Almighty"" just another average flick. As usual in an average Jim Carrey movie, it has a few very funny scenes. Like the rival anchor man contender being forced to talk nonsense and make funny faces (which is technically messing with free if you ask me, still funny though), the Jimmy Hoffa discovery and the Clint Eastwood imitation are all simply hilarious. These miniature Carrey-sketches saves the movie from being just totally ridiculous. None of the other actors make great appearances and the plot is more or less the blueprint of 10,000 other light Hollywood comedies. It gets sappy and uninspiring at the end too. Good enough for a lazy post party Sunday perhaps, but there are better Jim Carrey movies for that use."
"shineonucrazy","2","1","4","23 January 2004"," funny...but majorly flawed!
","I love Jim Carrey's acting and in this film he's pretty funny.  However, the story is ridiculous.  Bruce's career is in jeopardy and -strangley- decides it's all god's fault.  Finally he meets god and god tells him that he will be endowed with all his powers.  However, this leads to many philosophical problems.<br/><br/>First of all, god is supposed to be omnipotent...why is it god has to follow the 2 rules: no one can know you're god, you cannot mess with freewill. By this very reasoning, the idea of god-omnipotent is defeated.<br/><br/>
This movie is fundamentally flawed on so many levels...so many loopholes. I won't even get into the Yahweh(Yahoo) email service!!! I did get a couple of chuckles out of the dog/bathroom scene...and the monkey flying out of that guys butt, but the philosophical problems were too distracting for me to really enjoy it.<br/><br/>See this if there is nothing else to watch.

"eminkl","4","0","1","17 April 2020"," Jim Carrey is the Grinch; Jim Carrey is God.
","It's not specifically what he asked for; cursing the Creator over a particularly bad day (humiliated during his flunky comic-relief-TV-reporter job, fired, beaten up, etc.), Carrey just wants to know why God hates him so. It's the suffering of Job reloaded for the media age (will many Americans sympathize with the angst of a presumably well-paid TV personality?), and God, in the person of Morgan Freeman, calls Carrey to Him and offers him a job. ""I'm going on vacation,"" God says, blithely leaving the universe in Carrey's jittery hands. The message is clear: If you think being God is easy, you try it.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is interesting only insofar as it proposes God as a basically well-meaning if remote deity, not the maddening Shaper who drove William Blake to wonder if the same God made the lamb and the tiger. Fundamentalists whose noses are forever tilted for the scent of sacrilege won't find much in the movie to object to. Morgan Freeman, for instance, embodies God as a hip update of George Burns' avuncular, amused Lord in Oh, God. Both actors are a stroke of casting wit, but a wilder, funnier movie might've given us, say, Danny DeVito or a tipsy, irritable Eddie Izzard as God (heck, we've already had Keanu Reeves as both Buddha and a neo-Christ, no pun intended).<br/><br/>Essentially, this is another of Jim Carrey's surefire vehicles that can be whittled down to a phrase: Jim Carrey is the Grinch; Jim Carrey is God. I like the guy, and I wish his box-office failures with The Majestic (understandable -- that was a stiff) and Man on the Moon (I had the poster hanging on my wall for years) hadn't scared him into such bland, unchallenging material. What would Jim Carrey do if given ultimate power? The question provokes a grin of anticipation, but he pretty much does what you see him do in the trailer. There is one spectacularly funny bit when he sabotages the newscast of snotty rival Steve Carell, but the big laughs in the scene belong to Carell, not Carrey.<br/><br/>The movie seems squarely aimed at a large audience (check the opening-weekend figures) that might be wondering, in these harrowing times, if God knows what He's doing. Bruce Almighty is here to reassure doubters and put them in their place at the same time. The godlike Carrey fritters away his power and can't even hold onto his girlfriend of five years (Jennifer Aniston, being a good sport). Only God, the movie says, knows how to use the power, and He uses it mostly by not using it: ""You all have the power,"" He lectures Carrey. What should be a wild, unruly, possibly sacrilegious fable think Life of Brian becomes a didactic companion piece to The Truman Show, with Carrey as hapless puppeteer instead of hapless puppet. And it says essentially the same (humanist) thing: Take your life into your own hands.<br/><br/>Carrey does get off some good riffs, mostly in his pre-God fits of pique; I enjoyed his obscene jazz-pantomime gesture, destined to be copied by giggling kids from shore to shore. The subtext, though, shows us a man with the power of God who's still insecure and, as the movie spells out, wants to be loved."

It mixes Carrey's usual facial antics and high energy with good special effects and gags that actually make sense within the story. The story of course going that this everyday guy gets powers from God (Morgan Freeman) himself. He promptly uses these powers to improve his own life, ruin the career of his competitor and make his girlfriend's breasts bigger. Because that's what we all would do, whether we admit it or not.<br/><br/>And therein lies the beauty of this film. It actually has a good message to deliver. And this all culminates in Morgan Freeman as The Big Kahuna himself. Fantastic, heartfelt role and a message that goes unsaid too often. Because it isn't enough that you wish for something to happen. You need to go out and be part of the solution. Don't just wish for a miracle, be the miracle.<br/><br/>Is this film a bit clunky? Yeah. Is it immature? Oh yes.

","I suppose what this film is saying is that given the opportunity Bruce is given, the natural thing to do is to act entirely selfishly, feathering your own nest, and being crass and insensitive. He uses what he has been given to be self indulgent and selfish. I guess there is some religious message in all this, since God actually appears (the soft spoken Morgen Freeman). I guess because Jim Carrey's persona is at the center, we don't get took see God pick a person who has lapsed into despair over the state of the world, the treatment of women, the abuse of children. Yes, i know it's a comedy, but it has that heavy handed stuff in it that says, ""There is only one way."" Of course, Carrey will eventually have too much of a good thing and abuse his powers because he never had any character to begin with. He learns at the end, but only after he has a bit of guilt for causing death and destruction. Mostly, he is clueless. By the way, is Morgen Freeman an American Christian God or does he represent the world in general? Just asking."

","This is one of the most iconic comedies of the turn of the century, and it's probably Jim Carrey's most notable work, along with ""Lyar Lyar"" and ""Ace Ventura"". The movie revolves around Bruce, an ordinary man who suddenly receives from God all the divine powers while the Creator himself is allegedly on vacation. It could only end in a great mess. Jim Carrey was at his best, and is truly the pillar of the film, with jokes of all kinds and for all tastes. I think his comic vein has had a great influence in the direction of the script, and I do not rule out the hypothesis that some of the jokes have come out on the spur of the moment. Veteran Morgan Freeman has played God, and it's delightful to see the laid-back, positive way he looks at Carrey with a great sense of humor. Both are great actors, but the truth is that we are so used to seeing Freeman in action movies or ""Seven"", just to give an example) that we are very pleasantly surprised whenever we see the actor in a more relaxed, As is the case with this film. The story, the script itself, is very good. It's that kind of movie that seeks to convey a positive message to you while it makes you laugh. It talks about how we can have a positive attitude towards the problems of our life, and that usually what comes easy is easily lost.<br/><br/>Good movies with uplifting and truly human messages are increasingly a rarity nowadays. Therefore, I commend the work developed in this film, which educates besides amusing the whole family."
"Horror-yo","8","0","1","20 May 2016"," Good comedy about God and love
","Jim Carrey meets Morgan Freeman, God, and gets to take on his responsibilities for a while. Jim Carrey gets to be God, and we get to watch that on the big screen. Only with great power, comes great responsibility, that old chorus, and quickly Carrey discovers the burden of it all. He quickly walks up the social ladder and forgets the things that are more important in life, more important to him. This film is about opportunity, and living in the present moment, being there and standing strong before the things we love dissolve out of our own fingers, and no quick fix can bypass our own effort. Along the way there are good laughs, we all remember that scene with Steve Carrell being out of control with his speech as the anchorman, and Carrey delivers the goods as he always does. Morgan Freeman, superb as God. Very believable. It's a well made little mainstream comedy with a few points, and good ones; that lets itself watched. And for a plot and concept this ""predictable"", this film does quite a good job."
"Wuchakk","7","0","1","21 January 2016"," What would you do with God-like powers?
","Released in 2003, ""Bruce Almighty"" chronicles what happens when God (Morgan Freeman) gives His powers to a complaining news anchor (Jim Carrey) and takes a vacation. Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's girlfriend and Steve Carell his rival anchor; Catherine Bell and Lisa Ann Walter are also on hand.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is better than 1977's ""Oh God!"" because Morgan Freeman is superior in the role of the Almighty. Plus, how can you go wrong with Jim Carrey? While the movie starts off rather dull it perks up as soon as Bruce (Carrey) acquires God's powers; and for a solid half hour there are loads of laughs. At the end of the second act, however, the movie sorta nosedives, but then recovers in the last act with some surprisingly moving and even inspiring material. <br/><br/>The movie runs 101 minutes and was shot in Buffalo, New York City, San Diego and the Los Angeles area. <br/><br/>GRADE: B"
"StevePulaski","5","0","1","20 January 2013"," When a sketch would've done justice to the material at hand...
","Bruce Almighty could very well be the one film where Jim Carrey gives everything he's got, making a character so over-the-top and goofy that it would go on to be one of his best performances. Not in my eyes. From the first few frames with Jim Carrey's character, I knew this endeavor may not go so well and, sure enough, I was correct. It has taken me a long time to warm to Carrey the same way I've warned to actors such as Jack Black, but his crazy personality is something that has left me quite annoyed in many of his films. Upon seeing it, I was a little disappointed by how bumbling and idiotic both him and Jeff Daniels were in Dumb and Dumber, yet the film now seems to be one of Carrey's stronger works when put under the same light as this film.<br/><br/>To put it simply, this is a tired comedy exercise, unsuccessfully blending its religious premise with slapstick, and tacking on mawkish sentimentality making the last thirty minutes a gooey slog to watch. We follow Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey), a second-rate reporter for a news station in Buffalo, New York, who has just lost an open anchoring positioning to Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), the conniving, smarmy man who loves one-upping Bruce. Frustrated and angry, Bruce throws a fit while interviewing people at Niagara Falls, costing him his job, which causes him to yell at his wife (Jennifer Aniston) and focus all his blame on God for shifting focus on him.<br/><br/>Bruce then receives persistent pager messages from an unknown number, which he begins to ignore, until caving in and realizing that it requests him to go to a deserted warehouse to meet the one and only God (Morgan Freeman), who tells Bruce that keeping up with several pray requests and helping out so many in need is a difficult job that is often taken advantage of or under-appreciated on the grandscale. He then gives Bruce his position, equipping him with all the divine powers (IE: walking on water and possessing the ability to accurately imitate people), and the unprecedented, unearthly responsibility of keeping those in touch with their faith happy and joyous.<br/><br/>But before we get into the sentiment, let's explore the infinite comic possibilities of Jim Carrey being God. In the relative beginning of the film, to end off of Bruce's bad day at work, he is beaten up by a group of local thugs when he attempts to protect a harmless bum. When Bruce now possesses powers, he intimidates the thugs and the one thug makes some sort of comment involving ""monkeys flying out of his butt"" and you can bet your bottom dollar Bruce makes it happen in a ridiculously unfunny scene that channels the worst comic tendencies of a PG-13 screenplay. It too doesn't help that Bruce's character is an ungrateful man of little charm and so much zaniness that he induces a headache every time his mouth opens.<br/><br/>There's Carrey's hyperactive tendencies, and just the obligatory fact that this story practically extracts every laugh and every tear (there will be audiences, quite possibly those who are religious, but not enough to where they can't laugh at the form of satire) with a premise that basically concocts this very anemic, tired tale of redemption and ""putting yourself in the shoes of the person you criticize."" This is the third time director Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey have collaborated on a film, with the first two being Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Liar Liar. Both films expressed Carrey's style with the same rabble-rousing, uncontrolled behavior this one showcases, but with more of an emphasis on humor and spontaneous enjoyment rather than heavy-handed religious satire. I also learn it took three people to pen this story, Steve Koren, Mark O'Keefe, and Steve Oedekerk. One thing I could've guaranteed from the start, if I knew the writers, was a nice emotional third act, which Koren churned out to his advantage in Click but in a too little, too late fashion in A Thousand Words. Those films centered Adam Sandler and Eddie Murphy, respectively, in their madness, where this one victimizes Jim Carrey showing that he can be funny, if taken in smaller doses.<br/><br/>Yet I can see devoted fans of Carrey's anarchic comedy embracing this film with an open mind and a willingness to laugh. There's a larger audience for this film than I can estimate, yet in the small world of satirical comedies with religion in their crosshairs, I can assume why studios aren't cranking out more of them, and I don't believe controversy is the prime reason.<br/><br/>Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Aniston, and Philip Baker Hall. Directed by: Tom Shadyac."

","What a bummer. The idea could have been really good. Watching Evan Almighty was great because it had humor, it contained the whole religious stuff in it, and was entertaining.<br/><br/>This? This was downright bad. For once the ""sequel"" was better! I mean, right from the start it is all negative. With the constant profanity and many sex scenes, I wonder what the filmmakers were thinking! The only good thing I like about this is how the reporter had fun with his powers. A bit wrong at some points, but still funny.<br/><br/>Interesting how ""God"" is played by the same actor in both movies.<br/><br/>Rated 4/10 for all the crap they shouldn't have added."
"tiger86-2","2","0","3","9 July 2009"," Just idiotic
","Let me tell you something. I like Jim Carrey. I really do. I loved his performances in the Ace Ventura movies, I liked him in 'The Mask', he was great in 'The Truman Show'. I liked him even in 'Batman Forever'. I am not kidding. I think he is a very talented actor and could give us some great comedies. He has done it before. That is why I thought he could do it again. That is why I saw 'Bruce Almighty'. That was a big mistake. Really.<br/><br/>The trailer was kind of impressive and the idea sounded very interesting when I heard about it for the first time - Bruce's life is miserable and Gods helps him by giving him the power to do everything. We expect some great humor, some interesting moral, something worth wasting time. What we are left with is just idiotic.<br/><br/>I guess we were supposed to feel sorry about Bruce's miserable life. But how could I feel sorry about a man who acts like him? How can I feel sorry about a man who just refuses to show some control over his emotions? How can everyone feel sorry about a man who is losing everything just because he acts like an idiot and for no other reason? Then he got his Awesome Super Powers but instead of trying to do something real he just tried to take another man's job. First, I think this is like going shopping with an airplane, and second, the way he did it is really bothering me. He was causing natural disasters. I repeat it. He was causing natural disasters. He risked many people's lives just to become ""Mr. Exclusive""! And I am supposed to like this man?!?! Well, come on... Then he made all of his neighbors dreams come true. But what were their dreams? It was like all of them were dreaming about the same thing - winning the jackpot of the lottery. Well, come on. Again. People are different. Sometimes they dream about money, they want all of their problems to be solved, they dream about love... Somebody may dream about the death of his boss, other might want his neighbors to disappear magically because they annoy the hell out of him, other could beg for a date with Miss Universe... Where were that kind of dreams? <br/><br/>The other problem with the character of Bruce is Jim Carrey. That's right. He is overacting all the time. It was like the director was constantly asleep and there was nobody to tell Carrey something like ""Hey, man, ACT NORMAL FOR JUST A FEW GOD D**N SECONDS, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!!!"". Even when Bruce was supposed to be normal Carrey was not. I know, he does the same thing in all of his comedies but has never been so annoying. Never. <br/><br/>There were, of course, other important problems. We were supposed to think Evan is an a$$****. That's what one of the characters said. But why? He didn't do anything bad. Anything. He was just better reporter than Bruce and that's why he got the job. Yet after Bruce got his power he humiliated him in front of the cameras. That was mean. Like... Like Bruce was taking his revenge for the fact that Evan is a better human being than him. And Morgan Freeman... Don't get me wrong, I like him. I think he could play even a piece of wood and make it a great role but his character here was... Just nothing. They could have had anybody for this role with absolutely no difference. The same thing could be said about Jeniffer Anniston. She was just pathetic. And there were just no other characters. <br/><br/>Well, I will stop here. I still think the idea was interesting and could be great for a good dramatic movie. That's why I am not giving 'Bruce Almighty' 1/10."
"mario_c","7","0","1","23 February 2008"," ""I got the power""
","It's an entertaining comedy with a clear and nice message: it's not easy to be almighty! I enjoyed this movie because of two main reasons. First, it has some funny jokes, especially in the ""first half"" of the film. Second, its main message: the great difficulty of being too much powerful. In fact, should not be easy to have the power to control everything, because we can never please everyone! People are so different that is impossible to please them all! On the other side of the message there's the point that many people don't even know want they want to themselves, so how could they be God and rule everything? That's the case of the main character of this movie BRUCE NOLAN (played by Jim Carrey).<br/><br/>This movie, and the kind of comedy used, was done in Jim Carrey's measure, as he fits perfectly the character. Though, and in spite of the good message I did refer above, it's a ""pop corn comedy"" done in Hollywood's standards, so I can't score it more than 7/10 (and a great part of this score is for the jokes!). A story like this but with another kind of cinematography I think I would give a better score! However, it's an entertaining and enjoyable film."

"johnnyboyz","6","0","1","3 January 2008"," With great power comes great responsibility.
","If Tears for Fears' 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World' hadn't already been used in Adam Sandler's 2006's comedy 'Click'; then I might have been forever associating that piece of music to this; Bruce Almighty, which apart from being one of lead actor Jim Carrey's best films; also doubles up as director Tom Shadyac's best from what I've seen. Bruce Almighty is a film with a heart; with a true heart. Its idea is that of one where the hero, who is of course down and out, would get the opportunity to play God but it isn't a film that merely gives Carrey an excuse to act stupid in a manner that may have anyone under the age of sixteen laughing but the rest of us cringing; oh no, it's something a little more than that.<br/><br/>From very early on, it would seem both Carrey and Shadyac are harking back to their old ways. There is a massive billboard advertising Bruce Nolan (Carrey) half way through the film which is a promotional photo from Liar, Liar from what I've read; Bruce also references Ace Ventura with the 'Hi-Ho Away Silver!' quote and you could well change 'allrighty-then!' into 'Almighty-then!' But there are deeper things than that. The set up revolves around one man and his tragedy in a way reminiscent to 1994 Carrey master class The Mask and like The Mask, Carrey's character is given superhuman powers which enables him to turn his life around from zero to hero as well as help out other people now and again. But whilst The Mask was a little lagging in its narrative what with its clichéd mobsters and so forth, Bruce Almighty makes up for in heart and realism. At a time when so many big budget films are being made and distributed, it is great to see a film like this not take advantage of its budget. The film's idea of God is not a spectacular vision of light, CGI effects and so forth but in the form of Morgan Freeman; himself chipping in with references to his previous work: ""You'll need room se7en on the se7enth floor"" he quips. Heaven as a filmic space is fascinating to look into and parallels with Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure spring to mind but the film's idea of heaven is not this vast, expansive space with people entering all the time but this tiny office floor inhabited by nothing and nobody bar Nolan and God himself.<br/><br/>It would seem strange of me to say so, but the film acts better as a character study of one man; not a comedy. It's now apparent that Carrey can play the serious role what with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but here, he is breaking through into that 'serious' mould by taking on a subject matter and certain characters in their own psychological jeopardy whilst mastering basic one-liner comedy and giving us a performance; this is why you could argue that this is Carrey's best film over the likes of The Cable Guy and the Ace Ventura films: he begins one person, progresses and finishes someone else. The Mask did this on a basic level but much of that was on a far, far higher comic level. Another subject the film tackles with relative ease is the topic of God himself. Whilst maintaining the perhaps outdated theory that God is both male and inhabits a white beard; people will be quick to point out God is indeed black. Some interesting points arise here; namely the fact we have to assume Freeman is playing the Christian God and not Allah; a Roman God or anything else. Secondly, notice how things such as the slave trade in centuries gone by have perhaps been overlooked: if God really is black, how does he justify how black people have been portrayed and used throughout history? It's interesting to note that the gang of thugs featured were of the Hispanic variety but whether what has anything to do with anything remains too ambiguous to comment on; as do the multiple theories behind casting Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>Due to my feelings on having this film labelled a comedy; which I feel is wrong, I think it fails at certain times when it tires to be funny. Carrey is of course his usual smart, fast and quirky self who cracks a couple of jokes and attempts to make us laugh but how much of it was scripted? Did Carrey make a few additions in the process? Because it isn't as hilarious as it would've been had actual writers spent time to come up with material. Consequently, the scripted humour comes in the form of Nolan and Grace's (Aniston) pet dog constantly peeing on the furniture as they pick him up and carry him outside: genitalia and urine in clear view  not funny. Also, Nolan's telepathic foreplay with Grace through the walls gives us a crude inside look of what it's like to make love as a 'God' but it isn't funny and feels very out of place in the film as it acts as an excuse to produce meek, juvenile laughs  as does the urinating dog re-occurring joke.<br/><br/>I think that with humour aside, Bruce Almighty works as an inventive and challenging film with a heart at is centre built on a great premise. The humour in the form of Bruce using his powers to win Grace back after certain events was weak as was the way the film stopped for that entire segment. But the film has some fantastic ideas and some interesting moments that have you laughing at the inventiveness rather than the jokes. A clever and thought provoking film but don't expect to laugh too much."

","Another one-gag wonder by Tom Shadyac, Bruce Almighty is the equivalent of a McDonald's hamburger--predictable, dependable, and gone if a matter of seconds. The story of a shallow TV news reporter who is given the chance to have godlike powers, thereby giving him some depth, some appreciation of the world around him, is not a real mind-bender for originality, but it does have a slew of frenetic Jim Carrey moments, an always-lovely Jennifer Anniston, and the presence of a whimsical Morgan Freeman as the God who reminds Carrey of what is important.<br/><br/>It's all fluff and stuff. You can't get mad at Bruce Almighty because it has enough of what you came to see to keep you from getting bored and thumbing through a King James Version."

About the only thing Bruce can look forward to is his main squeeze Grace(Jennifer Aniston who's just as cute and sexy as ever!)then one day things get worse when he's canned from the station, then the depression sets in. Never fear though the unexpected happens when Bruce's cell phone rings and he answers it sending him to a empty building to meet the big guy himself you guessed it God! And Morgan Freeman plays him so graceful and in a classy way, anyway Bruce is given the role of becoming God! The special powers he acquires are great, they work to his advantage it gives him pleasure and fun while messing up and hurting others. Some scenes are funny like his parody of parting tomato soup in the diner just like ""The Red Sea"", and his fishing and pulling of the moon's gravity. Finally in the end he becomes a god of love and caring by helping others and answering their needs and he finally becomes the successful reporter and lover he always wanted with help from up above. Steve Carell and Catherine Bell have cameos as news anchors. Overall as always great acting from Morgan Freeman and Jim Carrey is funny as ever in this funny and moral comedy a real winner."

","This was never designed to be more than an entertaining, sweetly uplifting movie. There have been many movies that attempt this genre and many have failed. Bruce exceeds at both the comedy and the romance, eventually. The comedy is a given since it has Jim Carey in it as long as you find him funny. I know 1 or 2 that do not. The romantic part is supplied by the one of the most gorgeous woman alive who has perfected pouting lips. (Still don't understand Brad's choice.) Bruce does go the extra effort to illicit misty eyes from most of the viewers.<br/><br/>It could have been better, if it had used the more than capable supporting cast more effectively.

This movie also has some solid acting by Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman as God, not to mention Jennifer Aniston. I also found that the It's A Wonderful Life parody to be cheesy yet funny. <br/><br/>Here is the plot of this movie. Bruce Nolan does not exactly a great life. He is fired from his job and he lives with his girlfriend. Then he meets God. God tells Bruce that he can be God to see how it is like. Bruce discovers that being God is not exactly easy. He has to answer people's question and so forth. He also discovers that being God can be fun. He can get a new car and he can do anything that he wants. Then his girlfriend leaves him. Bruce then gets hit by a car. He is not God anymore. His girlfriend comes back and he has a better life, and he marries his girlfriend. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good and funny film. There is really heart-wrenching moments yet there is some moments that you laugh so hard until you twitch on the floor. I also like the moment with the gangsters and the monkey.

Steve Carell shows his comic genius during the anchor scene, which you have to see to appreciate. Jim Carrey is also an incredible comic actor, regardless of the bad press that he receives, I think he is a talented and diverse actor with extraordinary comic range. The story idea is original and well constructed, although slightly predictable at times. It also suffers from a lack of an exploration of God's powers and His role in the world - there was a great deal more that could have been done with this idea.<br/><br/>Overall an entertaining and highly watchable film.

To have a man being offered a chance to be God is a great idea, and it is hilarious how this idea is brought to the screen with Jim Carrey being His Holiness for one week. There are some absolutely unmissable scenes that make for a riot of a viewing - check out the scene where Bruce gets his revenge on the gangsters. But the good thing about this film is that it manages to incorporate its outrageous moments into the plot - Bruce's abuse of the moon to impress his girlfriend leads to floods in Japan - very good attention to detail. This film is something special - it is, literally, a godsend. With a famous cast - Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman as God and Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's suffering girlfriend, this film has something for everyone, and numerous moments in this film hammer this fact home - all actions have consequences. If you were to become God one day, would you use your powers right? (Of course there's an absolutely fat chance of that, though it will be much more fun to visualise yourself as Him after you've seen this.)

","After first watching this movie at the theaters, I thought that Bruce Almighty was a complete waste of my money because it was not nearly as funny as I thought it would be. I felt like all the good parts of this film was shown during its upcoming previews--I hate that. Once I saw this movie for a second time in my writing class, however, I now feel like Bruce Almighty actually features some intriguing aspects in relevance to conversion. Throughout the film, it appears as if Bruce's problem is that he loses the love of his life, Grace, and is desperately urging to get her back, but, in reality, Bruce's real problem is his utterly egotistical nature that virtually blinds him of seeing all the good that he already has in his life. Also, when one thinks about it, Bruce's selfishness is a virtual mirror image of what American society has become and been for quite some period of time: all about me, me, and me first."

","This movie shows a lot of good that the way that Jim Carrie can act. I thought that although it was very funny this movie also had some meaning to it that many people did not see.<br/><br/>When it starts out Bruce is a guy who always thinks that the world owes him and that he is owed something by some one. He is a simple man searching for a simple meaning to life and all he wants is a better life because what he thinks is that he has a bad one right now even though he does not. The bum with the signs is almost a play by play of what Bruce is not really seeing when he should be. He thinks his live is average and wants a boost so god played by Morgan free man wants him to take his spot for a little while to see if he still thinks its easy and to understand how hard someone else life can be. After a tough time with having the powers of god Bruce finally figures out that he should have been thankful for what he had because he might not ever get it back even if he really tries because sometimes bad decisions can last for ever. I thought that the acting was really good in this movie and it showed how Bruce converted from being someone who wanted a lot of like to someone in the end who knows that he should just take life one day at a time and be thankful for what he has"
"bhartman33","7","0","2","25 November 2006"," A Really Good Film, For What It Is
","First of all, a little suggestion: If you're expecting ""The Mask"", or ""Ace Ventura"", then just move along. Nothing to see here. This isn't that kind of comedy. (It's arguable, in fact, that it's less a comedy than an idea movie, of sorts).<br/><br/>Carrey gives an admirable performance as a self-absorbed mediocrity in the beginning of the film. He's having a bad day, and towards the end of it, you start to wonder what Anniston's character (""Grace"", fittingly enough) sees in him. At that point in the movie, it's pretty difficult to watch, because you don't have any real sympathy. So Bruce gets a page (on his pager) from God, and after the requisite (for this kind of movie) skepticism, takes on God's job for a week.<br/><br/>There are obvious problems with the premise. If someone ever really did acquire the omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence of God which is presumably the heart of His job, that person would be able to handle the tasks put before Bruce. It's one of the movie's conceits (essentially mandated by the Christian philosophy undergirding the movie) that Bruce is given God's responsibilities without being given his omnipotence. If Bruce were given true omnipotence (let alone omniscience), there wouldn't be much of a movie, so that is a necessary evil.<br/><br/>In my mind, this movie isn't so much a comedy as it is a love story -- albeit mostly an unrequited love story. Grace, Bruce's long-suffering girlfriend, obviously loves Bruce, and is there for him. The cliché breakup and their even-more-cliché reconciliation aren't really the climactic points of their relationship, within the movie. That climax happens when Bruce listens to Grace's prayers after their breakup, and in how he reacts to them (which I won't spoil for anyone). I've seen the movie twice so far, and that scene towards the end of the film always makes me tear up.<br/><br/>In short, the comedy in this movie isn't great, and Anniston herself isn't given much to do. (A significant amount of her character's depth comes from what Bruce sees or hears *about* her, rather than *from* her.) The physical comedy is good, but not great. (i.e., it's not ""The Mask"") The thing that, to me, makes the movie worth watching is Bruce's initial fun with his powers, watching the consequences of that fun, and his eventual epiphany at the end concerning what it really means to love Grace.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film, but certainly worth watching."
"lists-9","5","0","1","15 November 2006"," Bit of a missed opportunity
","This could have been dazzling but, for me, was a misfire, mainly because the Jim Carrey character was so hard to like. I'm a Carrey fan, but in this case, the script and direction seemed to be against him.<br/><br/>Near the start of the film, Bruce's boss refers to another character as ""an asshole"" and says ""You couldn't be"". However, he behaves like one through most of the film, with his whining and complaining seriously overdone. You have to wonder why his girlfriend sticks with him for so long. As often, the dog (when he appears) steals the show. <br/><br/>The best scenes are the ones a third of the way through, after Bruce first gets his powers. Here the film shows energy, with Carrey doing what he's best at - being an amusing ""wise guy"". After this, though, it all gets a bit tedious. The performances are fine, particularly from Carrey and Morgan Freeman, but the filmmakers don't seem sure about where they're heading, or what the moral (if any) is. Ultimately the film is a bit of a mess."

One day, Bruce tries calling the number that keeps paging him. It leads him to a warehouse that turns out is like a gateway to heaven. God shows Bruce the sins he's committed. Bruce thinks that God sucks, and God gives Bruce all of his powers to give Bruce a chance to redeem himself. At the beginning of the movie, Bruce thinks the powers are for playing with. He ""parts the Red Sea"", makes a monkey come out of a guy's butt, and other nonsense like that. Then, he starts to realize that being God is no piece of cake. He accidentally lets everyone have whatever they want, and the world turns into hell. Bruce realizes then that he has to fix this all. He doesn't know how to. When he goes back to the warehouse to get God's help, God is not there. Bruce is all alone, the world is hell, and all of a sudden, Bruce gets hit by a truck.

","The first time I saw this, tears were streaming down my face from laughter. Jim Carrey delivers a hilarious performance, as always, and I believe that this is important for everyone to watch because there's a message in it. Bruce is basically a guy who thinks God is pathetic at ruling the universe. So one day, God comes along with a challenge for Bruce: He will give Bruce all of His almighty powers for Bruce to use any way he wants. Sounds pretty sweet, huh? Pretty simple? So does Bruce. As Bruce gets used to his new powers, things get much better in Bruce's life. He gets back at his backstabbing co-worker, trains his dog to use the toilet, and becomes the greatest reporter in the country. Things are great for Bruce, sounds like? Finally God tells him to answer all of the prayers people are sending him. To save time, Bruce says YES to all of them. That's when things begin to fall apart.<br/><br/>The message this movie has for the world is that we underestimate God. We're constantly thinking of what a terrible job God is doing controlling our lives, but if we look deeper, we'll see that every link is connected to another link, and if one link breaks, the entire chain comes tumbling down. God makes our lives the way they are for a reason, and no matter how many times we think that God is not exactly doing a bang-up job, He knows what He's doing, and if we were to fix it, everything would get much worse. See this movie."

","Bruce Almighty is exactly what you would expect from a Jim Carrey movie.Silly. It builds itself around Carrey and his arsenal of stupid expressions with the occasional laugh out loud joke and the occasional awful one. Carrey plays Bruce a news reporter who thinks God has a personal vendetta against him. However after all Bruces whining God, who is expertly played by Morgan Freeman has had enough. He grants Bruce all his powers for a period of time so Bruce can correct all the wrongs he ""thinks"" are in the world. The supporting cast throughout the film is a mixed bag with Steve Carrell on awesome form as Bruces enemy at the work place, but Jennifer Aniston is not convincing as Bruces long time suffering girlfriend. As for Carrey himself well he plays the same role he always does, that of the flawed but lovable goon. He is effective but if Carrey isn't careful he will kill that character and that could seriously effect his future in the industry. The jokes keep a smile on your face and make the experience of watching the film enjoyable, but there just simply aren't enough gut busters in the script to keep this film long in your memory. To conclude Bruce Almighty is a decent film, but not one worthy of purchasing on DVD are making a sequel to."

","""You wanna see a miracle son? Be the miracle."" That is the premise of Bruce Almighty. Although I was somewhat hesitant about what I have heard of this movie at first, it turned out to be pretty darn good. Bruce (Jim Carrey), an aspiring TV anchorman, goes through life struggling and blames all of his misfortunes on God. Bruce then meets God (Morgan Freeman) and is given his powers for a time. Bruce then uses these powers to his own advantage to raise himself, but ends up losing his girlfriend, Grace (Jennifer Aniston), in the process. It is only after losing the woman that he loves so much that Bruce realizes what he really wants in life and gives in to the will of God. Then he regains the love of Grace and succeeds in his work life as well.<br/><br/>At first, this movie seemed somewhat sacrilegious as Bruce goes around doing whatever he wants in the world, but the movie ends up having some very true, and very strong lessons to it. I especially like the play on words with Grace being the name of Bruce's girlfriend, but also being the only thing that he wants from God by the end of the movie. The line about being the miracle is especially true as many people thing that all they have to do is sit back and everything will be taken care of the way they would like it. So get up, do something, and make your life what you want it to be!<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is a good movie that is funny, but also solemn when appropriate. The TV version has some extra editing to it, which kept it a little cleaner as well, which I liked."

He has a good job, reporting on Channel 7 news, he has a beautiful girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), and he lives in a great apartment. So he has a near perfect life, but he is always complaining about it. So when the news anchor at Channel 7 is retiring Bruce thinks he has a chance for the job. But another slimy news reporter gets the job, Evan, who Bruce already hates. This is the final straw for Bruce and he shouts and while on air, then has a row with his girlfriend when he gets home. He blames God (Morgan Freeman) for all the bad things that have happened. <br/><br/>So God invites him to meet up, while Bruce is unaware that it is God. God gives Bruce all his powers. So Bruce uses them to his own advantage rather than helping others and ends up getting dumped by his girlfriend. But in the end it all becomes too much for Bruce and God regains his powers. Although Bruce's life goes back to normal, he gets his girlfriend back and his old job, he is now happier and a nicer person. In the very first scene Bruce is interviewing a couple who own a bakery. For health and safety reasons he has to ware a hair net. When he is told this he says ""Thank you God"". This could be seen a joke but it could also show us very early in the film that he has a dislike like for God.<br/><br/>When Evan, his rival news reporter gets the anchor job he makes a speech. The speech is copied from one that Bruce made at the end of the bakery report. I think that this shows that people don't take Bruce very seriously. But we know that from his arguments with his girlfriend that he wants to be taken seriously. <br/><br/>After he finds out that Evan has got the anchor job he shouts and swears on air. Then he loses his job and gets thrown out. As he lies on the floor there is an aerial view of him. This could be God looking down on him in his moment of shame. Then he saves a guy from getting bullied by some men. Here he could be seen as a hero, but he takes it a step too far and gets beaten up.<br/><br/>After his row he's driving and asking God to ""give him a sign"". There is a truck in front with bright signs saying stop, witch is an obvious sign, but Bruce takes no notice and crashes. I think that the bright lights represent Gods involvement in the signs because road signs don't usually glow. <br/><br/>So after shouting abuse at God, God arranges a meeting with Bruce. Bruce pulls up in an alley way. The surrounding buildings are tall and there is a shot from the top window of one of the buildings. This could be God watching Bruce. But I think that the big buildings look intimidating and the view is showing how insignificant Bruce is compared with God.<br/><br/>When he enters the building it is decorated in pure white. This represents the pureness of God. God is up a ladder when Bruce finds him. Then he turns on a very bright light. Quite an obvious representation of heaven but I think it works well. <br/><br/>After Bruce is given God's powers he goes to a restaurant. He orders soup and recreates the parting of the red sea. The soup represents the sea and the camera is at a very low angle inside the dish looking up at Bruce. This suggests the new powers that he has gained.<br/><br/>The sign of Bruce as 'Mr Exclusive' is on top of a skyscraper. This could represent the heights that Bruce has reached in the media in this part of the film, or it could represent him as God looking over people. It is a very ambiguous shot. The clouds on the sign could also represent him as God in the heavens. Nearer to the end of the film there is a riot in Buffalo because Bruce has fixed the lottery and the ice hockey team won the cup. The 'Mr Exclusive' sign is thrown down from the top of the sky scraper. The camera follows the sign as it falls until it hits the ground. This is representing his world falling around him. All the pressure of been God has got too much for him. when the sign is laying on the floor it is on fire. The picture of Bruce on the sign changes from one of a well dressed man in the clouds (God), to one of a man on fire, which I think represents the devil. <br/><br/>After his party for his new job Bruce sets the fire sprinklers off because his girlfriend catches him kissing someone else. He sits on the sofa with the water going all over him. This is a repeat from the beginning of the film where he was at the Niagara Falls, which was a very low moment for him and so is this scene.<br/><br/>During the riots Bruce is working in the news studio. He is not aware of the riot at this point and there is a blackout. The lights keep coming on and off. I think the director is showing us the confusion in Bruce's life by creating confusion in the studio.<br/><br/>Near the end of the film Bruce is run over by a truck. The camera goes from an extreme close up of his face and zooms upwards very quickly. This makes me think that the camera is in the eyes of Bruce's soul going up to heaven. The film has the typical Hollywood happy ending where Bruce gets his job back and gets engaged to his girlfriend."

","I just don't know why he keeps trying to concentrate on pronouncing words incorrectly. That's not comedy, that's a speech impediment.<br/><br/>Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a struggling reporter for a local TV station in Buffalo. After some pretty terrible things happen to him, like he's passed over for a promotion, and he gets beaten up by a bunch of Hispanics (Congratulations to Noel Gugliemi for landing the role of 'Hispanic Thug #1' yet again). These kinds of things would ruin anyone's day, I'm sure. He blames God (Morgan Freeman, in another fresh and original role unlike any he has ever undertaken) for all of his problems, like most rational people do, but God has a trick up his sleeve: he's going to give Bruce his powers! Oh, what fun! Instead of making himself master of the world, or a multi-billionaire, Bruce instead abuses his powers in less creative ways, such as to make the dog pee in the toilet, which is probably just what I would do if I were ALL-POWERFUL.<br/><br/>Well, if there's one thing I can't get enough of, it's heart-warming comedies where characters learn something. This is just the type of movie that is just too absent from Hollywood.<br/><br/>Oh, wait, every damn movie that comes out follows this exact same formula. I've been fooled yet again! Damn you Hollywood! Damn you! If you think saying words improperly is funny, this is the movie for you."

","Jim Carrey (Bruce Nolan) is having a hard time. He can't control his actions at work. He can hardly continue with his love life. And he can't control what comes out of that mouth of his. But things get better when God (Morgan Freeman) grants him all of his powers. So now Bruce can get to work on time, be with his girlfriend Grace(Jenifer Aniston) and he can even control what happens to others that have harmed him in the past. But during all this he looses his girlfriend. Now he must act to get her back. But how do you get your one true love when you can't control free will?<br/><br/>I guess you have to watch the movie to see. A lot of laughs and a lot of funny actions coming from Jimmy here."

"thefreeway2003","8","0","1","15 April 2005"," Being God...
","""Bruce Almighty"" is an amusing film, which is all about a man, who basically has terrible luck in everything he does. Everyday.<br/><br/>Produced by T.Shadyac, the cast includes Jim Carrey as Bruce Nolan, Jennifer Aniston as Bruce Nolan's girlfriend Grace, and Academy Award Winner Morgan Freeman as God. One must say it's a darn good cast.<br/><br/>The story begins with Bruce Nolan's daily routines. He doesn't enjoy his job, at a television channel's studio. Suddenly, someone retires from ""Live News"", and Bruce's dreams come closer. -- He passionately wants to replace him, as a new caster. All he wants to do is representing the show, and become famous around the city. But he has no luck! He couldn't be promoted. On the other hand, he starts fighting with his girlfriend, and tries to cope with his pet. Even his dog doesn't listen to him. Thus, he decides to talk to God, and tell him his troubles. Finally, and miraculously he manages to have a conversation with God. After that incredible event, Bruce gains some powers to rule the whole world for only 24 hours.<br/><br/>The film is definitely full of funny moments, and you can also see some special effects such as; running through the sea, organizing the moon and stars, hearing the prayers of people all around the world.<br/><br/>The cast is good, as I've pointed out before, actors give a superb performance, and the special effects are entertaining. So, I highly recommend it."
"RNMorton","5","0","1","11 April 2005"," Pop religion takes a hit
","The idea of Morgan Freeman being God and loaning Jim Carrey his powers is such a neat idea. But I guess making an entertaining movie about it is harder than it looks, kind of like being The Almighty. There's about enough good scenes for an attractive trailer (which this movie happened to have). Beyond that and a couple of funny jokes from Morgan you're on your own. For the most part Jim uses his new powers to help his ""romantic life"" and get ahead in the local news grind by playing cruel practical jokes on his competition. No fun there. So they squander some great comedic opportunities and deal out lousy ersatz religion all at the same time. I would get more upset about inappropriate and bad religious movies like this and Michael, 'cept they're so bad in their own right there's little danger of anyone taking them too seriously. Maybe God is more active than some people think. At least a Friend-less Aniston (the way we like her) rises marginally above the material. Morgan, on the other hand, should have been a little ashamed of some of the inane stuff he says as ""God"", particularly in the wrap up."
"policy134","5","0","1","24 March 2005"," Basically a repeat of Liar, liar but compared to the Truman Show quite enjoyable.
","Yes, Jim Carrey could probably act in this movie and sleep at the same time. He has played this character under different aliases so manny times that it seems that he just wanted to cash in his check this time. Maybe he was tired of being rejected by the Academy so many times that he just threw in the towel and said: ""The hell with it!"". Even so, this is a somewhat worthy effort. Bruce, as Carrey calls himself this time, would probably never get out of the rut he is in (much like Carrey's role in the Mask) if fate hadn't stepped in, actually the personification of fate, God. Somehow, we laugh more at people's misfortune than charm (think Homer Simpson, Al Bundy etc.). When Bruce gets the powers of God we are only slightly amused but kind of bored. I can't really speak for everybody but I think many will agree.<br/><br/>The performances are what we expect in a movie like this, even Morgan Freeman gives a somewhat limited performance (congratulations on finally winning an Oscar). Jennifer Aniston is underused as Lisa Kudrow was in the two Analyze films. The one surprise is Steve Carell, who has a new show premiering tonight on US TV. In the scene where Carrey makes his usual grunt noises and makes them come out of Carells mouth, it's astounding how well they play together. I don't know how many times they retook this but it's the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>The endless last 30 minutes seemed tacked on by Carrey himself to make some kind of statement to the audience. What a waste of film, we didn't want to see another retread of ""It's a wonderful life"" for the umpteenth time and I think Carrey should stick to one formula at a time. The same happened in Liar, liar but they only wasted 10 minutes in that movie. I understand that Carrey had a new film in theaters with a serious role again. I can't figure him out but maybe i'm not meant to because then there would be nothing to write about him."

"jerome_horwitz","4","0","2","22 February 2005"," Too typical for Jim Carrey in 2003
","First I'd like to say, I'm a huge Jim Carrey guy. Since In Living Color I always thought he portrayed some excellent characters and is very funny.<br/><br/>However, Bruce Almighty really just seems like a culmination of the last few movies Carrey has done. He's an antagonist and protagonist, all in the same movie.<br/><br/>The gist of the movie is God switches place with Carrey, then leaving him in charge of everything I guess. This even includes answering prayers. Of course Carrey is overwhelmed by all the responsibilities he never realized that God has.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays God, and is excellent as always in this supporting role (will we ever see him as the star?). If there was anything very enjoyable, it's Freeman's presence on the screen for short times that occurs.<br/><br/>What happens during the course of Carrey being God is just too typical. Yes, some of it's funny, but really it's just kind of average. For example he 'splits the red sea', he poofs in himself a race car, and he get's his news casting nemesis busted for possession of several pounds of pot. You know, all the stuff we would do if we were God.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the typicalness continues throughout the movie. For example the 'now for Carrey' obligatory rain scene too common in Carrey's movies these days (The Majestic, The Truman Show, etc.).<br/><br/>I found ""The Majestic"" a much more refreshing movie. As for this movie, I really think we've seen a better Carrey-god character in ""The Mask"". I'm sure Carrey liked this role, but to me as a fan it just seems like another giant paycheck for an underwhelming effort. 4/10 (maybe 4.5)"

"CurtMan@LVCM.com","Null","0","1","24 September 2004"," A mostly delightful and entertaining ""Mr. Supremacy"" comedy
","""Bruce Almighty"" contains one of the most worthy concepts ever contrived in all of comedic history: fitting the funniest man in Hollywood (Jim Carrey)into the shoes of the Almighty. How could anyone want to miss this kind of comic brilliance? For the most part, ""Bruce Almighty"" delivers well on ""divine power"" comedy, featuring Carrey providing his signature comic genius to this ever so innovative premise. There are many enjoyable and satisfying elements to the film, as Carrey works diligently if unconventionally with everything he has to work with. His aspiring-to-be anchorman profile works well, as when Carrey takes over as God, there are plenty of fantastic stories to cover, including a hilarious scene involving an obnoxious coworker who is, let's just say, publically humiliated by the hands of Carrey. That being said, there are plenty of unwanted elements to detract from this otherwise brilliant comedy. It becomes absorbed in sentimentality towards the end, and practically deviates from comedy to trauma, as Carrey's powers are used less universally and more...personally (but not in a funny way). Instead of adhering to the ""diving-powers"" comedy premise, the film becomes a romantic, moral, and ethical crusade for Carrey, with the last half hour of the film involving him ""correcting manners"". As a comedy, ""Bruce Almighty"" has it in the bag and succeeds brilliantly, yet towards the end, it is well...less divine. Good for what it's worth. *** out of ****"

","I admit it...I'm a Jim Carrey fan. I've seen just about everything he's done except Mystic Theater (or whatever that was called). It looked bad so I skipped it. Carrey reminds me so much of Robin Williams. Just give him a script and the freedom to mess around and improvise and you've usually got comedy genius. It's not a 5-star film...It could have been better. However, Bruce Almighty has a wonderful message...which is that when you learn to give to others, you get back riches. Carrey's character was pretty self-centered and he deserved what he got in the beginning of the film. It was only at the end, when he told God that he didn't want Aniston back...he only wanted her to be happy and that she deserved to be with a guy who would treat her with respect. That was a serious moment in an otherwise funny movie. If we could all stop being so self-centered and learn to give a little more to others and to improving the world, we might all be a little better off and a little happier in life."

And in some cases you might end up tearing up.  Although clearly The Truman Show is Carrey's best, this isn't too bad.  But the director in charge overshot the movie.  So it's a bit choppy.  Skips around.  Many of these details come out by watching the 30 minutes of deleted scenes.  Some I thought should have been kept in.  But many never should have been shot.  So the director stunk as far as overshooting the movie.  The editor stunk because he took too much out.<br/><br/>And the sexual overtones knock this movie way down, because it could have been a decent family movie.

","I'm sorry, but only a few minutes, if that, was shot in Buffalo. If you couldn't tell by the clean streets and the obvious clock towers in Back to the Future on the Universal Studios lot, much of this film was shot outside of clean, quiet Buffalo. An overall good comedy for Jim Carey, it is funny for both a child and an adult audience. The only complaint I have about the film, other than it was not shot entirely in Buffalo, is that the studios marketed the film as a Jim Carey comedy. Even though it was the only smart choice to make, Jim Carey being a giant comedy star, the film is not your typical Jim Carey ""make them laugh"" movie. Jennifer Aniston and Morgan Freeman are terrific and make the film stands up on its alone without Jim Carey. Much like Liar Liar, audience members may have passed on this film thinking it was a typical Jim Carey film. In fact, Bruce Almighty is one of Jim Carey's better films with a good story and great cast of characters."

","Two things about this movie:<br/><br/>1) Did anyone notice how this movie is loosely based upon the same storyline as Bill Murray's ""Groundhog Day"" from a decade ago? Both are about sarcastic and cynical TV personalities disgusted with their current position in life. And both are about being granted with some sort of supernatural power or affliction to help teach them a lesson. Both characters at first abuse that power, and then learn to use it to the betterment of their own attitude and helping society. <br/><br/>2) This has got to be the most juvenile adult film I've ever seen. It's almost like a ""kid's mentality"" film for adults. <br/><br/>It still doesn't get as many kudos in my book as ""Groundhog Day,"" but it's worth seeing.

","Jim Carrey, who has thoroughly explored bathroom humor and Frank Capraesque drama, finds a very comfortable balance here. The plot: Carey is a newsman in Buffalo whose frustrations over his unmet aspirations to be a news anchor cause him to challenge God himself. God, in the form of Morgan Freeman, accepts his challenge setting up a pretty decent opportunity for some laughs. The choice to put Carrey's character in Buffalo rather than the New York City where most movies are set, seems to resonate in a symbolic sense, as the world Carrey inhabits always seems to be a little off the norm. Aside from Carrey's comedy, and a convincing performance by Morgan Freeman (as convincing as humanly possible, that is, considering he's playing God), I liked this movie because at heart it's very uplifting and speaks great truths about the power of love and `being a miracle.'"

","I had been looking forward to seeing this movie, determined not to be influenced by the two stars it was given in TV Guide. After seeing the movie, I decided that that was about right. The movie was funny in spots but kind of dragged in others. Also, it was pretty predictable.<br/><br/>
The always attractive Jennifer Anniston seemed underused, and I think the scene in which the anchor woman tries to seduce Bruce could have been funnier. She could have been the devil, for example, rather than just a beautiful woman with the hots for a coworker. My advice would be to watch this one on HBO but not to pay money to rent a DVD; you're likely to be disappointed."
"BubblyHoopla9","6","0","2","23 May 2004"," Hilarious! Loved every minute of it!
","I always love Jim Carreys movies, and this is one of his greatest. I've seen How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Liar Liar, The Majestic, The Truman Show, Bruce Almighty, and have loved them all. He never ceases to make me laugh. For example, if some other actor tried to do a remake of Bruce Almighty, it wouldn't work because it is impossible to copy Jim Carrey even if you were his clone. But on to another actor. Morgan Freeman is a great God. He is just so calm and cool and you just can't help but love him. God really must have blessed him, because he had a superb performance, Oscar worthy in my opinion, but of course the Oscar will go to Jim Caviesel as Jesus in ""The Passion of the Christ"". Jennifer Aniston did a great job in the role she has done 19 times. Don't get me wrong, Jennifer's great, but she just does the same ""Rachel"" role over and over and over. But who doesn't love Rachel on ""Friends"". I thought this movie had a great plot, i mean ""What if God was one of us?"". They carried the plot greatly, showing a man on the verge of suicide, not getting the recognition he deserves, then gets Gods powers and fixes everything wrong in his life, while getting ample air time on the news and earning the name ""Mr.Exclusive"", but then realizes the job is harder than he thought because, turns out, you can't just help yourself. Is on the verge of suicide again, and doesn't want the job anymore, and tells people that you have to ""Be the Miracle"" and fixes his life by helping himself. Great movie, a great Shadyac film, i give it 10/10."

One day, he has a very bad day because he didn't get promoted in his job, he lost his job and plus he got beaten up my some hoods and Bruce thinks the God (Morgan Freeman) is picking on him. So then the next day when Bruce visits God they discuss things and so Bruce was offered to be God for 1 week so Bruce got to have God's job which I think sounds really cool! So while Bruce is God, God is out taking a vacation. I thought this movie was just very clever with all the jokes and all. One of my favorite parts is where Bruce was in God's office and he opens the file cabinet and it was shooting out really long! Another one of my favorite parts is where Bruce was getting even with the hoods and one of them said the day that they apologized would be the day when a monkey came out of his butt and obviously it did! Another funny thing was that Bruce also used his powers to help the NHL team, the Buffalo Sabres win the Stanley Cup. The most hilarious part in the entire movie is when Bruce is missing up one of the other news casters when he was reading a report! This movie was just laugh-out loud hilarious! I would recommend this movie and that's the way the cookie crumbles."

","Warning: Possible spoilers.<br/><br/>It's either three strikes - you're out, or the third time's the charm; one signifies failure, the other success, and each happens often enough in life to be a clichÃ©. Bruce Almighty, the 2004 People's Choice Award for Favorite Comedy Motion Picture, is undeniably a charm for Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac, whose first collaboration in 1994, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective launched Carrey's career and whose second effort produced Liar Liar, one of the biggest hits of 1997 and solidified Shadyac's role as a comedic director. A self-proclaimed born-again-Christian, Shadyac compares Bruce Almighty to a modern day parable, and although it is not his intent to impose a specifically Christian message, he does hope to plant some seeds that will provide fodder upon which he hopes the audience will chew. Most of us have times in our lives when we rail against God and ask why. Why are you doing this to me, God? What do you want from me? Why can't I have that job, that house, or that life-partner? Why aren't you helping me to get, do, or be what I want? Why don't you answer my prayer? Bruce Nolan (Carrey) asks some of these same questions himself, albeit in a much less soul-searching and much more self-serving way than did Jerry Landers (John Denver) in 1977's Oh, God! upon which Bruce Almighty heavily draws. Unlike Jerry, the honest, humble boy-next-door, Bruce does not portray the innocent everyman, but conversely, an arrogant, greedy, self-important television reporter who believes he deserves a promotion to anchor, and will do just about anything to get it-and does. Most of what he does is unashamedly sophomoric, which is exactly how Carrey's rubber-faced shtick plays best. In a nutshell, Bruce has a bad day and blames God, and in effect, challenges God to a duel. Responding to Bruce's invitation to ""Smite me, oh mighty Smiter,"" God (Morgan Freeman) instead invites him to slip into his very own water-walkers to see if he can do better. Thus, Bruce Almighty is born, or should I say, born again. Unfortunately, Bruce reincarnated is as bad as the original. Given the power to perform miracles, Bruce enlarges his girlfriend's (Jennifer Aniston) breasts, lassos the moon for a romantic evening, and teaches his dog how to use the toilet. Moving beyond these harmless pranks, Bruce ups the ante to even some scores. The first is for die-hard Carrey fans only, and involves a monkey and the nethermost part of a smart-alecky punk. The second provided the best laugh in the picture. Bruce conducts his arch-rival's (Steve Carroll) speech causing him to sputter unintelligible nonsense for several long minutes. Some of his self-serving miracles have far-reaching consequences. Bruce causes a disturbance that not only provides him with a breaking news story, but also triggers a tidal wave on the other side of the world. He ceases the din of prayers in his head by answering yes to them all. When it backfires and he explains to God that he was only giving people what they want God replies, ""Since when does anyone have a clue about what they want?"" Finally, having been forewarned that he can't mess with free will, Grace finally sees him for the self absorbed idiot that he is and leaves him. Too late, he realizes what he has lost, and when he shares the pain of his inability to make people (Grace) love him God replies, ""Welcome to my world son."" Losing Grace. Now that's a theological conundrum. But no worries, Grace never really leaves Bruce, just as God's grace never leaves us. Realizing that Grace is the most important part of his life he offers a selfless prayer and Grace is restored. This film may not provoke deep theological discussion, but then it wasn't meant to. It was meant to show a relationship with a God that is as involved in our lives as God needs to be and yet who empowers us to ""be the miracle"" in this world ourselves. Shadyac said in an early interview that he wanted to make a movie that would cause us to think about our relationship with God and about what we do or do not believe. He wants to ""touch our hearts and remind us of how precious and patient God is in His love and mercy for all of us."" It didn't work for me, but perhaps it works for those who might not have gotten there any other way than a Bruce Carrey movie. God does work in mysterious ways."

But, the comedy moments, although mostly not classic, WERE funny. I laughed aloud when Bruce controls Evan Baxter's voice and words (and gibberish) during a news report.

"Garp23","6","0","1","29 January 2004"," Funny but sappy
","There are three Jim Carreys. There is the insane Jim Carrey, who starred as Ace Ventura and got `Dumb and Dumber'. There is the serious actor Carrey, who headlined `The Truman Show', `Man on the Moon', and `The Majestic'. And then there is the blended Carrey, where he takes a little of both and winds up with films like `The Mask', `Me, Myself, and Irene', and especially `Liar Liar'. All three Jim Carreys can be great, and all three Jim Carreys can be awful. `Bruce Almighty' lets Carrey blend his serious and comic sides again, and as directed by frequent collaborator and director Tom Shadyec, the duo hits more often than they miss.<br/><br/>Some of us handle life's big disasters smoothly but flip out if we drop a pen. Others ignore the small stuff but get overwhelmed by the big stuff. Carrey's titular Bruce lets both drag him down. Like many of us have at various ages and stages in our lives, he blames God for not doing a good job of people management. He is drowning at work, his girlfriend seems ready to call it quits, and life's traffic jams and potholes filled with water, waiting to be stepped in, surround him constantly. God, here portrayed (naturally) by Morgan Freeman, calls Bruce on his complaints and hands over His powers. Bruce now, literally, is a God.<br/><br/>At first, he focuses on getting even with those who have wronged him and making his girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) fall back in love with him, ignoring the prayers of all the poor schlubs like the one he used to be. The film has kicky fun letting Bruce flex and show off his powers. But he soon realizes that he actually has to help other people, and he messes everything up even worse, sending the world into utter chaos.<br/><br/>Eventually life lessons are learned and the film gets sappy. There are many ways this film could have gone: Bruce using his powers to duke it out with God or having kinky adventures. But `Bruce Almighty' takes the mainstream road, and this is not an insult. It does everything it is supposed to do, and it does it well.<br/><br/>Carrey provides a solid center to this film, although his mugging occasionally feels forced in a way it never did in `Liar Liar'. He introduces new catchphrases: `B-e-a-utiful' and his way of saying `It's good' and stretching out the 'oo' sound as if he were the Swedish Chef. These too seem forced; Freeman underplays an `Alrighty, then', a nod to Ace Ventura, so well that most audience members miss it, and this works much better than Carrey's antics. Aniston is saddled with the girlfriend part, in which she plays with little kids, obsesses over a photo album, and reacts to Bruce Almighty's crazy stunts. But she plays the part with such warmth and genuineness that when she hits her personal crisis, we actually feel it. This part, like `The Good Girl', proves that she should have a wonderful career after `Friends' takes its final bow.<br/><br/>There is nothing new here. The wheel is not reinvented. But this film delivers exactly what it should: some big laughs, some good characters, and a nice day at the movies. Thank God."
"Clive-Silas","4","0","1","2 February 2004"," The guts of this movie were ripped out - see how in the ""Deleted Scenes""
","Obviously we've seen this kind of movie before - the hook here is Jim Carrey and how his manic persona handles the responsibility of infinite power. Unfortunately the one bit of true Carrey-fication is the one you've all seen in the trailers where he mimes ""I've Got The Power"" and sets off the fire hydrant.<br/><br/>This film resolutely steers away from exploring even the tiniest potential in the ordinary Joe who is given the powers of God. I was shocked when I realised that the entire movie was going to more or less be about Bruce and his relationship with girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston).<br/><br/>The structure and story arc made no sense; the first thing Bruce does with his Godlike powers is engineer a night of superb lovemaking, but there was no hint that this was a problem between him and Grace. When Grace and her sister start talking about how ""tonight's the night"" that Bruce will propose, you wonder if Bruce is actually in the same movie, since a reluctance or otherwise to commit to Grace was completely absent from his characterisation. When their date turns out to be the most romantic dinner in the world, you the viewer know that it is in the way of these things that he isn't going to propose, but you are left mystified as to why, and when it transpires that it is all just to announce that he got the Anchor job you are left feeling that Carrey has suddenly turned Bruce into a completely different character. Later on in the movie Grace rounds on him and sarcastically yells that what she wants is a ""Boat, and sacks of cash"". This is puzzling because he had not manifested any particular materialistic tendencies around Grace - we didn't even know if she had seen the flash new sports car he was driving. And why was the only apparent consequence to answering everybody's prayers in the affirmative being everybody winning the lottery, ending up with $17 each? Surely a high school kid would have written a few more scenarios into a script about an omnipotent guy?<br/><br/>However upon viewing the Extras on the DVD, we discover that a lot of this important stuff was contained within scenes which were deleted before release. The restaurant scene actually ended with Grace berating Bruce and pointing out that she had been waiting for a proposal; subsequently there was a scene in which he took her to a mansion he had created for them, in the car he was now showing off - setting up Grace's sarcasm later on. It has to be said that the mansion scene in particular was poorly thought through and unconvincing - he just got a promotion at work and now he can afford a multimillionaire mansion? And she ""buys"" it? On the other hand, there should have been *something* in its place. All those prayer consequences had been shot, but were cut ""for pacing"" (although it may have been to eliminate a plot hole - God shows him the bad consequence of one decision which is actually down to God's foreknowledge of what would have happened if Bruce Almighty hadn't intervened; but if Bruce has *all* God's powers, then presumably he would already know this?) The director's commentary on the deleted scenes reveals director Tom Shadyac to be two things: talentless and spineless. If he wasn't cutting essential plot scenes for pacing, he was doing so because ""Jim was coming across too dark, and preview audiences didn't like it"", or ""We were worried that people might get offended."" For heaven's sake, Tom, any director worth his salt would at least *pretend* that these changes were forced on him by the studio, instead of on his own initiative having gone out of his way to make his own movie suckier. One consequence of this cutting was to dramatically weaken Grace as a character, leaving Jennifer Aniston completely wasted.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as usual is just money in the bank. There is nobody you'd rather have play God, but it is a shame to see it happen in this movie. <br/><br/>Carrey does his manic facial act with no context other than that it's Jim Carrey so you expect it of him. In the outtakes his crazy mugging has the whole crew in stitches, and you can't help feel that they must be laughing because he's the star. That consummate professional Jennifer Aniston scarcely cracks a smile during these events, I notice, particularly when Carrey practically molests her while making his silly face. And Carrey can't do schmaltzy redemption, upon which at least a third of the movie relies, to save his life.<br/><br/>One final point - every visual aspect of this film screams Los Angeles and Southern California, even to a Brit like myself. There is not the slightest feeling that this movie is supposed to take place in northern New York State."

Bruce Almighty gives us a great feeling from the very beginning on: it's opening scenes are very promising and we get the impression that this is going to be a worthy sequel to movies such as ""Mask"": fast and hilarious.All this is relatively true:some great gags and visual virtuosity right up to the moment God points out to Bruce that he's basically an irresponsible and unworthy human being.After this moral reprimand, Bruce is never the same any more and neither is the movie. It slumps, becomes sluggish and loses its appeal. A real pity as both Jim and Morgan were seemingly enjoying themselves immensely up until the moment the script really let them down.

For a bit I thought it might do that when he first got the power but it got on to tell a pretty cute story. <br/><br/>No, it was the funniest movie I have ever seen but yet it kept me smiling all the way through without dropping down to the toilet bowl humor that is so often protrayed in films and music today.  Where are we going to go after everybody gets used to the proper words for genitalia being used as the punchline?<br/><br/>I have heard some complaints about it being to much like some of the other classics from yesteryear.  However, there is nothing completely new anymore unless you refer to genitalia, as referenced to above.  It's a Wonderful Life follows this film a bit, but it is much different in the actual scene structure.  A film that leaves you going home with a smile on your face needs to have a happy ending, and Bruce does that; and to do that, you need a certain amount of drama before the happiness results. There are only so many ways you can do that, so a certain amount of simularity is certain to be there.<br/><br/>I thought Morgan Freeman was just about perfect, as were most of the others in the cast. My wife and I both enjoyed it and would not be afraid to show it to most anyone. If your faith is so weak that you must protest any reference to God, then you are to weak to pass any test."

I laughed so hard that tears were streaming down my face during that scene -- Carell steals the show here.<br/><br/>I think that Carrey is truly an original genius who is capable of sublime slapstick, and also of being very good in movies that offer more, like ""The Truman Show."" But just about everything about this movie feels tired and labored.  The TV news stuff is bad satire (except for that one great scene) because it has no relation to reality whatsoever -- it's just silly without being funny.   And the movie has a very irritating musical score (very similar to ""Liar, Liar"") that telegraphs everything, helping to spoil what little humor there is.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman hits the perfect note as God, underplaying his role nicely.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston is OK, but the role is undeserving of her talents.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the movie goes sickeningly sentimental toward the end.  <br/><br/>""Groundhog Day"" conveyed a somewhat similar message in a much less<br/><br/>cloying way.

"Arsenic Drone","4","0","1","15 January 2004"," Great concept, poor execution
","How can you mess up a comedy about an ordinary man (Jim Carrey as a somewhat self-centered reporter) being given the powers of God? I suppose a better question is how to do it right, and on that subject the creators of Bruce Almighty missed the mark.<br/><br/>This film takes an idea that almost everyone has wondered about in some form, in one of those ""what if?"" daydreams, and gives it a specific incarnation. The viewer is treated to some very well-done effects, like Bruce parting traffic, instantly coating everything in sight with Post-it notes, and driving girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston) wild. Don't forget the scene that makes the movie worth watching: Bruce forcing his competitor, anchorman Evan Baxter (Steven Carell from The Daily Show) to ramble and babble like a lunatic while on the air.<br/><br/>However, the plot comes up kind of short. It gets somewhat fragmented with all of the funny physical comedy, and then when it tries to hit on an emotional level (and a somewhat sappy, unoriginal one at that), there hasn't been enough buildup. In particular, Grace and her relationship with Bruce aren't given enough exposition to expect the viewer to naturally care about them, so some things come out forced. For the most part though, this is forgivable, since the film is really a comedy with a spiritual message, which it does get across.<br/><br/>The real problem is the soundtrack. The orchestral score is distracting and too demonstrative. It's reminiscent of cartoons or pure slapstick comedies: too many musical sound effects. It's almost surprising that there's no trombone going ""bwa bwa bwaaah"" when something bad happens to Bruce. On the other hand, the film isn't actually for small children like the score would suggest, since there is a fair amount of cursing and mature material (for example, Bruce driving Grace wild). Perhaps it might have been better served going with an R rating, exploring the idea more thoroughly, and tossing out the cheesy sound effects. Since the creators didn't make that movie, we don't know. In any case, the one they did make is passable, but does not live up to the high standard set by the concept it's based on."

Jennifer Aniston is also in this movie and what better reason to see this movie than to see her boobs get bigger.

It's the thread that keeps him on the air, but unfortunately it's also the reason he can't get in the coveted anchor chair.  This is not unlike Carrey's situation himself in the movie world.  He can't get the Academy to notice him even though he has done some quality work (""The Truman Show""), so he has to resort to clowning to keep the public's attention.  Did Carrey actually blame God for his lot in life?  Unclear, because he did not write this movie.  Nonetheless,  God gives him a chance to master his own destiny. Only problem is, he begins to realize that it's not just his own life he messes with.  And being God for others is a whole other job entirely.  The movie itself is entertaining enough, with a few big laughs and very even performances throughout, especially Freeman as God, who is a calm, understanding deity, the One who has seen everything, so nothing surprises Him.  The movie then goes on to bite off a little more than it can chew, but it leaves it well enough, knowing that it can't answer everything. Because then we don't need God."

","`Bruce Almighty' (2003/Tom Shadyac) **1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Many people (myself included), at one time or another, wish that we could obtain the powers of God himself. And that is the concept of `Bruce Almighty'. A wacky TV reporter, who is trying to take his career seriously, while his life seems to be going down hill, gets the opportunity to use God's powers to see if he could do a better job. But, like most `what if?' comedies, this film runs out of steam before too long, and the ending is as satisfying as one might hope for.<br/><br/>Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey) is a good reporter, he just is not taken seriously. So when he loses the big promotion (and his job), and gets the shit beaten out of him in the same day, he starts to lose his faith in the big guy upstairs. And who could blame him? But then, he gets a visit from someone he never would have expected.GOD (played by Morgan Freeman). Then, for the next few weeks or so, he gets to take God's place while he takes a vacation. What follows is a sometimes funny, sometimes routine comedy that does not add up. But part of if it is fun. Especially when in references `Dirty Harry', and when Nolan takes revenge on the people that did him wrong on the worst day of his life.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey does a good job, but it is not his best comedic performance. However, it is good to see him in his old form, for he has not made a decent flick in quite awhile. For all the actors (and even actresses) who played God in other films, Freeman is funny in the role, but he is not given that much to do. Joining these two is Jennifer Aniston, who in my opinion, is one of the sexiest actresses out there today. Despite these two well known faces, this is Carrey's movie.<br/><br/>`Bruce Almighty' is your average 'what if?' comedy.

","SPOILERS (Although lets be honest, it's not like you didn't expect these before the film even started)<br/><br/>""Bruce Almighty"" is Jim Carrey's attempt to return to his face twisting, funny guy ways, and by his standards, I quite like it. In this film, Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a News Reporter who dreams of that elusive Anchor slot. After an awful day, Bruce curses and swears at God, until eventually God answers. God (played without any real effort by Morgan Freeman) blesses/curses Bruce with his powers and sends him out into the real world to experience the ultimate job. Bruce sets off straight away to fix his life and only ends up making parts of it worse. By the end, most of what you'd expect to happen, happens, and you finish watching the film feeling like you've just watched any regular none descript comedy, which ironically, is what you have done.<br/><br/>Let's get this straight right away, ""Bruce Almighty"" would never win any awards, it was never meant to. This film is there for you to relax to one night and be able to shut your mind off whilst watching. Carrey performs in his old style, and whilst he infuriates me in so many of his films, in this I found myself actually warming to his character. Carrey is a good actor, we saw that in ""The Truman Show"", and in this he shows in a few scenes how emotional he can be.<br/><br/>Other than Carrey, what else can be said about this film? Not much really. The script is at times hilarious, at times sickeningly sweet, but ultimately satisfying, the other actors acceptable, and the message simply that if you want something, you've got to work for it.<br/><br/>Some people really hate this film, and whilst I can appreciate that Carrey might infuriate them, I just don't get why someone would detest this so much? It's nothing special for sure, but it's by no means awful either.<br/><br/>I suppose the one thing which, looking back on it, really makes me laugh about this film is how so many people on this website have made comments about religion. I mean, yeah this film is about a guy who becomes God for a few days, but ultimately, it never had to be God. God is a recognisable, easy to explain figure, but really Bruce could have got his powers from anybody. All this film ever needed to do was allow us to sit back, relax, and show us that (to quote Spiderman) with great power comes great responsibility. That's all.<br/><br/>If you choose to watch this film, and I recommend you should, leave your brain outside as it isn't needed. ""Bruce Almighty"" is simply another chilled out film for a family to watch on a night in together. It's by no means the best film of 2003 (not even close), but at the same time, it's by no means the worst. You get what you pay for and that's really the best way to summarise. Enjoy!"

","If you could be God for one week, what would you do, who would you help, how would you handle the most power in the world?  Bruce Nolan (Jim Carey), a field reporter for Channel 7 news, is trying to become a news anchor. When it seems everything is going against him, he turns and blames God (Morgan Freeman).  God then gives Bruce his powers for one week.  For the first few days everything seems so great Bruce can do anything he wants. As a result of his personal concerns, the entire Buffalo area is in total chaos and his love Grace (Jennifer Aniston) has left him.  Bruce then realizes that being God isn't quite as great as what he first thought.  Bruce finally realizes that he is content with being a field reporter and being with Grace.  The thought of playing God seems great at first until you realize how great of shoes you must fill.

However I only scored the film a 6 because I'd seen most of the funny visuals in the film's trailer but didn't find this a spoiler unusually so much as to find Carrey's character dislikeable, being so self-centred but what a mope his girlfriend is. She didn't communicate well with the Carrey character. That aside this film has heart which is rare though the characters are an unsympathetic lot, who treat each other badly rather than support each other.  A dreadful view of humanity from that standpoint. So to sum up the film makers work :) great theology lousy psychology."

","OK, it's clear that ""Bruce Almighty"" has stirred up quite a storm of controversy apparently on all fronts for its views of religion (I've read it's been banned in several countries) and the fact that the powers of God can be trusted upon an average joe, who is in this case, Bruce Nolan (played by Jim Carrey).  I have no beef against ""Bruce Almighty"" because I feel that anyone can relate to Bruce's situation, and I think that is what a lot of this movie's attackers have missed.  Yes this is a comedy, but it has a heart and it's in the right place.  <br/><br/>As for the storm, however, the question of whether or not this movie is truly blasphemous in any kind of way, I'll leave to the scholars but don't look past the message that this movie is trying to convey to the audience. It simply tells a story that you should love yourself for who you are and that God (or some force higher than Man) has a plan for you and don't think that you are insignificant.  God (or a higher force) always answers, but the answer you receive may not always be the one that you desire. <br/><br/>

","Wow, what a surprise - a Hollywood film that portrays the Jewish/Christian God in a positive light (and he's black! I know that's gonna cause a lot of problems with the fundamentalists!) <br/><br/>I was a bit worried that it would be blasphemous and irreverant, and that at the most I would get a few guilty laughs out of it. Much to my shock, it turned out to be a wonderful movie. Jim Carrey does a great job portraying Bruce, a man whose life isn't going as well as he thinks it should. He blames God for every one of his failures in life, and some of the things he says COULD be considered blasphemous, but this story is really about a man who starts off thinking that money, job status, and the recognition of his peers is what life is all about. However, throughout the course of the movie, and through his meetings with God, he learns what's really important in life, and of course these things are: a relationship with the Creator, love, compassion, and selflessness. Bruce goes from a self-pitying jerk who thinks that God and the world owe him something, to a kind and caring man who puts others before himself. I know that in today's jaded, ""me first"" kind of world, a movie with a message like that isn't going to impress people (and that's pretty sad, when you think about it), but instead it's going to be called ""lame"", ""preachy"", ""corny"", ""sappy"", and a million other derogatory terms. Well, if you are a person who doesn't really care about majority opinion, then you will see this movie in spite of the bad reviews and decide for yourself, and you may even enjoy it. On the other hand, if you're a person who is easily swayed by critics, or overly religious (yes, that's possible), or someone who can't enjoy a film that lacks a nihilistic, cynical message, then avoid this because you will hate it.<br/><br/>

","Though I found Carrey hilarious on the show, In Living Color, and though the Ace Ventura movies got a quite a few laughs out of me . . . I can't say I ever really cared about any of his characters.  If Ventura got his head blown off in a serious and tragic scene, I would still be struck with laughter and not shock.  Sure, his antics were funny, but after awhile when you think about Jim Carrey as an actor all you see are goofy faces you really couldn't care less about.  <br/><br/>Thankfully, Carrey's began investing in better comedies that are funny on more than the idiotic laugh-because-Jim-makes-a-funny-face-every-freakin-moment comedy.  Thankfully, Carrey's begun proving that his talent extends further than the third grade antics performed by a full grown man. <br/><br/>
Bruce Nolan is an everyday Joe whom most people can sympathize with, connect with, and really share in his moments in all their ups and downs.  Humor like this hits home for me because Nolan does the exact same thing with God's power that I know I would do: abuse them . . . make my life great . .. and most definitely pay a few people back.  And well, since I don't have the powers of God and never will the next best thing is watching Bruce Almighty where I can suspend my disbelieve and enjoy Jim Carrey wielding them.  <br/><br/>Of course, one comedian can't sustain an entire film since half the laughs come from all the other character's reaction to Bruce and his antics and for that the other supporting cast of Buffalo get applause.  Oh yes, and this film could not have worked without God, and Shadyac did well to cast the great Morgan Freeman as Alpha and Omega.  Freeman brings an elegant all knowing air and a humanistic touch together for an intriguing interpretation of God.  Far better and more memorable than just a bright light or all-business interpretation.  I mean, as Gallagher put it, `Look at the giraffe.  Does this look like the work of a serious artist?'  But Freeman doesn't bring anything that could reasonably called sacrilege to the role.<br/><br/>And for the religious types, there's even an underlying message.  All in all, Bruce Almighty is surprisingly one of the best comedies with religion as one of its major themes."

Jim Carrey has become funny again. His latest movies haven't been him. I think he tried to step away from comedy for a while and become a serious actor but it didn't work for him. I'm sure glad he decided to enlighten moviegoers and make this wonderful comedy. He shines in this one. Morgan Freeman was great as God. He's such a great actor. I loved the part where Bruce asked him how many fingers he was holding up and God said seven and Bruce held out his hand and he had two extra fingers on one hand. And the part where Bruce was making that anchorman talk gibberish was hilarious. I did think that the whole thing about Grace (Jennifer Aniston) getting mad at Bruce and leaving him was a little sappy but every comedy has to have a breakup/leaving scene. You know? Oh, and one of the scenes I laughed the hardest at was when Bruce was in the cafe and he said he needed a spoon and a spoon came out of his mouth! Now that was funny. I had never seen this movie when I bought it on DVD. Well, I'm sure glad I own it now. Jim Carrey is definitely one of the greatest comedic actors on screen right now. Anyways.

"drunken_critic","7","0","1","21 November 2003"," Bruce Campbell Almighty
","Was this part 4 of the Evil Dead series?  Throughout the film I kept thinking that it was shot in the same style as early Sam Raimi work.  The action was fast paced and cartoonish like Dark Man and Evil Dead.  I think this movie should have been called Bruce Campbell Almighty.  Jim Carrey who played Bruce must have watched Evil Dead for inspirational acting ideas. His character had the same manic personality as Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>
This movie started out great.  Bruce's life is not going very well.  He keeps blaming his problems on God's spite.  He loses his job, but is nice enough to help a homeless person in need.  He gets an offer by God played by Morgan Freeman to do his work.  Gods reasoning is that he needs a vacation. This means he will have God's power.  The best and funniest scenes of the movie take place when Bruce uses the power for his own amusement.  He makes his girlfriend's breast bigger, he makes her horny, he gets a sportcar, and uses his power to sabotage his enemies.  The first part of the movie was funny, but then comes script block.  The second part of the movie felt stagnant.  It involves him becoming depressed because his girlfriend leaves him, and he wants to use his powers for only `good'.  I was disappointed that it started out so funny and zany, but ended up trying to prove that God's power is too much for a mere mortal.  I think this would have been a great movie if it kept up the fast paced tempo that it had in the beginning. The director seemed scared to make a movie with no point.  It would have been better if he kept the movie irrelevant.  At the end it had the corny happy Hollywood ending.  Why not have Bruce stay happy with the powers of God?  Is it too morally wrong and unethical to think that maybe a mere mortal human could handle great powers?  I personally would have liked to have seen him handle the powers without any problems.  It ended up being a clichÃ©.  He was given the power, but he could not handle it.  Too bad, I could have handled it!  But then again I am the drunken critic. 7/10"

","Bruce Almighty (2003) Jim Carrey, Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Catherine Bell, Lisa Ann Walter, Philip Baker Hall, Mark Adair-Rios, Sally Kirkland, D: Tom Shadyac. Carrey is at his quintessential funniest as a star-crossed Buffalo TV reporter who's always complaining to God, and He comes down in human form endowing all of his celestial powers to him, seeing if he can do any better. Wild, sweet-natured comedy-fantasy is a charmer. A lot of laughs, which are hitters, steer clear of crudity (on the whole), with Jim expending his energy into every one of them. Not only for the toleration of his goofiness-and that's saying something, and Bible-thumping Christians won't find it to be sinfully irreverent. John Denver was in a similar situation in OH, GOD; George Burns played God. Running Time: 101 minutes and rated PG-13 for language, sexual content, and some crude humor. ***"

","Many have speculated on what they would do if they were God (of course, many have also speculated on whether or not there's a God in the first place, but that's another story). ""Bruce Almighty"" offers one man's answer to this question, and does it in such a way that only the most hardened Bible-thumpers could take offence. Them, and the sort of people who think going down to Westminster and throwing things at David Blaine is really clever (i.e. the deeply cynical amongst us).<br/><br/>Tom Shadyac's movie is well-served by its casting of Jim Carrey as a lightweight but ambitious TV reporter, Jennifer Aniston as his big-hearted girlfriend, and Morgan Freeman joining Alanis Morrissette, Sir Ralph Richardson, Charlton Heston, Gene Hackman (or rather, his voice) and George Burns - not to mention Eric Clapton - in the ranks of those who've played God; outside of ""The Simpsons,"" the Almighty hasn't come across so winningly on screen since, well, ever. <br/><br/>The storyline is something of a superhero story in reverse; most people get incredible powers and use them to help others from the off, but here the protagonist puts himself first and has to be prodded into helping others. Although the movie's very definitely on the side of helping people, and portrays his actions as amusing without actually condoning them - e.g. turning a rival's evening news stint into something more embarrassing than Albert Brooks's ""Broadcast News"" debacle, increasing the size of his girlfriend's breasts, inspiring MacKenzie-off-""JAG"" [as a work colleague] to wear outfits Paris Hilton would reject on grounds of skimpiness... okay, that last one was a lie - ""Bruce Almighty"" thankfully never turns into an extended sermon. ""Touched By An Angel""/Michael Landon fans need not apply, in other words.<br/><br/>The movie's finale is a bit predictable, but overall it's a pleasant little parable, designed to send you out of the cinema (or in my case out of the plane) with a smile on your face and a bit more hope in your heart.

When looking at my experience with the movies and after seeing the first 20 minutes of Bruce Almighty I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Now it's one thing to have a bad/cliche storyline in a movie, but at least the majority of them are enjoyable.  Crossroads was an awful movie, but at least I could sit there and make fun of the characters to myself (and plus, Britney Spears alone in the movie made it worth my wasted time).  Bruce Almighty was just obnoxious and embarrassing!  There were so many times when Jim Carrey (one of my favorite comedic actors) would try out his goofiness and fail miserably.  There is nothing more humiliating than a comedy that isn't funny.<br/><br/>To make it even worse the movie pretty much offended me.  A normal movie in this type of cliche where the main character obtains a special power and has himself some fun with it and realizes it's more work than he/she thought in the end--teaching them a valuable lesson in life--would at least make me think to myself ""I wonder what I would do if I had those powers.""  I could not say that throughout the movie I was daydreaming about becoming God because that is just evil, and so is the way it is portrayed in this movie. Jim Carrey becoming God?  Walking on water?  Parting his soup?  I am definitely not a religious freak but I still say BLASPHEMY!  Now I wouldn't think this film was blasphemous if it actually had a point, purpose, or if it was even entertaining, but all this movie did was just play.  The writers were probably sitting around one day trying to think of a way to write a cliche screenplay with a new premise, and decided it would be fun to PLAY God for once.  I wouldn't care if I saw a movie that encouraged the worship of Satan as long as it had a point and/or a message.  So I am offended not because a normal guy challenges my beliefs of God's ultimate power by becoming him, I am offended that the filmmakers toyed around with this subject (very poorly, I have to remind you, and without any hint of entertaining material) just to please Hollywood studios, say they worked with Jim Carrey, and to make a chunk of change while they're at it.<br/><br/>In the end I give this movie zero stars for not only having a crappy storyline, but by the lack of comedic/entertainment value, and by taking the subject of ""God"" and exploiting it disrespectfully, illogically, and completely half-@ssed."

Of course the people who do not bother to think beyond that will hardly understand why things aren't always peachy. In a way, Bruce was one of those people. Sure, he had suffered setbacks despite being good in what he did, he had to live with the treachery he had suffered, but haven't we all had such? Definitely what brought Bruce in the ""God business"" was the fact that he was a good person, even if egocentric at times, and he had the ability to help many people. He just had to learn that. We all have this ability, but we are sometimes too bothered with ourselves. Once Bruce gets the chance to be God, he does all he desires(only for himself, of course) and learns, as was expected, that it isn't as easy as it seemed. <br/><br/>It's all a very strange problem. Difficult even. The human mind can hardly conceive the term of ""God"", of someone alone who takes care of all. So it is practically impossible to be a human and play God...and play God well. That's not possible, it just ain't, because He is not just ""something"". At least that's how I see it. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is God, a funny and not entirely distasteful twist. He's just such a good guy all the time, I guess he deserved to play God as well. Jim is just tremendous, despite some usual over-hyped scenes, but he usually brings comedy to a new level, with his characteristic faces. And as a couple with Jennifer, it can only get better.<br/><br/>""Bruce Almighty"" is, obviously, far from serious. It's a bit of silly fun with a few simple teachings at the basis of the story. I mean I haven't seen anything I didn't expect, labeled ""message"". It was all as we learn at school God would do it. You are offered the chance to laugh pretty often, so just take advantage of it! Sure, some things are too silly, but that's all about having fun. So just get to see Bruce."

","After seeing the previews i decided to see the movie and i actually enjoyed it. in the beginning it contains good comedy to introduce us to the main charactes and about theres every day lives. After Bruce Alimighty (JIm Carrey) recieves gods powers i think that the transition between hilarious and joking to seriousness was very smooth and believeable. Granted Jim carrey can do pretty much anything that envloves this kindof stuff considering its his ""normal"" role (which he does very well) but adding morgan freeman into the picture as god made it absolutely delightfull. While carrey was ""joking"" around, freeman plays a more serious role that contains a hidden message within the movie that is actually kindof good. Overall this was a great movie (not including the acting of jenifer anistan who tries to be funny but really sucks at it) and i do recommend it for people of all ages. its a movie that contains all the entertainment you need into one film with a really serious message to it if you just think about it"

Unfortunately, his act begins to seriously grate in 'Bruce Almighty' and when the inclusion of him spouting various clumps of nonsense is the only thing REMOTELY funny in this film you know it's in trouble. The music is far too syrupy and floats around in the background in a kind of ""Isn't everything so great?"" way.<br/><br/>The plot, as I gathered it before my brain went walkies, is that Bruce fails at everything in life and decides to blame God. So God (in the form of a criminally under-used Morgan Freeman - I had a theory that any film featuring Morgan Freeman would be, at the VERY LEAST, watchable, but 'Bruce Almighty' has just blown that out of the water) comes down and gives Bruce super powers in order to show him how hard being a deity is.

Jim Carrey is way too over the top, his style of playing the nouveau God isn't suitable for the moral point the film tries (and needs) to make at the end, very funny his performance is but its just not good for the film.  The cast itself reads very well, and Jim Carrey would be good if they were just making a simple comedy- but the man cannot do sincere!Which the film really needs to pull off if we are to make sense of why God 'gave' his powers to Bruce in the first place.<br/><br/>Although Morgan Freeman is extremely good, and very well cast as God, Jennifer Aniston was criminally underwritten and the angle that she could of put on the story would have added alot, instead they merely put her in a lovesick role, that she can play very easily.<br/><br/>Trouble is the film could have been so good if they'd just tried and actually concentrated on making it witty and meaningful.  Fine, if you want a plain, slapstick comedy this is okay, but it could(and should) have been so much better.  I left the cinema unsatisfied and i don't think i'll be watching it again."

"ihateeverymovieisee","Null","0","2","8 August 2003"," Read The Book Instead
","First off I want to explain why some religious people are offended by this movie. In order to do that I'll briefly explain the story. Jim Carrey is an aggravated news reporter who meets God. God is played by Morgan Freeman. Anyway, God gives Jim Carrey his powers, so Jim Carrey becomes God. Anyway, religious people are angry about this story because they don't like to see God portrayed as a humor-filled human. Furthermore, according to the Bible (John 3:21) ""And God's skin was white."" Seeing Morgan Freeman play God isn't very accurate to God's bestselling novel, The Bible. I think that this movie is better than the book is based on, but Jim Carrey's portrayal of Jesus is a bit off. I didn't know that cars, New York, cookies, TV, and other modern devices existed during the time of Christ. Religious people might feel that the book is better than the movie in this case, the book I'm speaking of is none other than The Bible- the New Testament written by God. Anyway, this movie unfortunately turned out to be a romantic comedy. Romantic comedies are NEVER funny. There's only ONE funny part in the film, which is worth the watch. Also the actress who plays Susan Ortega is absolutely B-E-A-utiful! Other than that this film sucks. I strongly recommend reading the book instead of seeing this. The movie didn't even attempt to include Jesus' disciples, or curing of life long illnesses like blindness and leprosy."

He's still got a long way to go to match, say, a Robin Williams, on the ol' ""stand-up comedian to serious actor""-ladder. But at least he's moving upwards. (I'm looking at you, Chris Rock.)<br/><br/>In this film, Jim Carrey is almost the straight man; the farcical elements happen AROUND him, not BECAUSE of him. Intriguingly, there IS a very Carrey-esquire moment, but it's not Jim Carrey acting - it's his arch-rival Evan Baxter, who gets to act like Jim Carrey (and, may I say, that was a very nice performance by Steve Carell, the Daily Show alumnus).<br/><br/>I like this movie because it's gutsy. It ventures into a controversial, spiky arena. I'm sure a lot of people are offended by the very thought that God is played by a black man, and that's just the beginning. It's an OK movie, but probably ultimately forgettable. A rung in the aforementioned ladder for Carrey and probably not much more."

Meanwhile, he's having problems with his job and his girlfriend (Aniston).<br/><br/>In the end, this movie completely shocked me. I expected it to be ALL fun and laughs and nothing really serious. As it turns out, Bruce (Carrey) turns out to be a sensitive man only willing to please his girlfriend and make her happy even if that involves him not being in her life. He also learns that the people praying to God, need to have enough faith in themselves to figure things out themselves, and believe in themselves. It holds for a very strong and possibly very emotional ground for those that have extreme faith in God. Some may be offended by some of Carrey's remarks when angry with God; others may find this movie insightful to their own faith and prayer.<br/><br/>

Like the whole tantrum on the bed when Jennifer Aniston is telling him to get out of bed, and a few other cases.  But the scenes where I was laughing so hard that the tears started flowing more than made up for those few ""too nutty"" scenes.<br/><br/>On top of the great story and the hilarious comedy, there is also a fair amount of special effects in the film, which are nothing less than great and work very well with the story.  And of course, there is the lovely Jennifer Aniston, need I say more?  She's looked better, but she did a fine job in the role and I enjoyed watching her performance.

","Spoilers may follow...<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is a family comedy about a selfish man named Bruce (Jim Carey) who has an endless amount of bad luck. This movie also introduces faith and how strong it can and cannot be. It shows that relationships cannot last unless both people contribute to each other and the bond that they are sharing.<br/><br/>Bruce blames all of his bad luck on God and starts to lose his trust and questions if there really is a creator (God). Along the way he discovers that who he is and how he reacts to certain difficulties won't help him in the real world. He eventually settles down and starts thinking about other people as well as himself. This movie is set in Los Angeles (California) in the year 2003. The focus on the film isn't rich in materialistic terms but is rich in the value of friendship.<br/><br/>The problems start when Bruce gets a phone call for a supposed `job offer', which Bruce then chooses to interview for. When he turns up for the interview he enters into an empty white room apart from one man cleaning the floor. This man tests Bruce in different ways, for example this apparent cleaner asks for help with his cleaning to test Bruce's character. When he enters the next room it looks exactly the same with the same man in the centre fixing a light Bruce then gets confused and asks what is going on, the man then introduces himself as `God'. God mocks Bruce for complaining about his bad luck in the last week or so. God then hands over the job of controlling the Los Angeles city and its people to Bruce. Bruce thinks it is a joke and later realises that the job of being God is a serious matter. This job also has rules and regulations that have to be followed like any other job. Bruce is then God for a week, he has peoples prayers as well as his own life to look after during this time. Problems with his girlfriend, job and street gangsters that are eventually sorted out in the end, surface as a result of being God. His faith in God increases and he takes more notice in helping people and is less selfish in his actions toward others as well as himself.<br/><br/>`Bruce Almighty' is a humorous film that also touches on serious matters underlying the story that makes the movie more interesting to watch. This movie isn't made for everyone, as some atheists may be offended by the storyline. The cast and producers have created a well structured movie, which is in the cinemas at the moment.

","Jim Carrey is playing the 'goofy news reporter' (Bruce Nolan). He wants to make it to anchorman of the studio but is being rejected as such by the management. This reflects Carrey's successful comedy acting in real life, and when he wants to play a more serious role, 'the audience' (in general terms) doesn't recognize him in it. Jim Carrey is actually referring to his own acting history in this film and that's what gives the whole an extra dimension.<br/><br/>Like in the Truman Show, Carrey proves in Bruce Almighty that he is a great actor and not only good at playing blimps. In my opinion he should be offered (again) a role in some good drama movies, ones in which the audience sits down and after five minutes casts aside the thought of Carrey as a comedy actor. I'm convinced that that could be a turning point. Carrey has climbed the comedy ladder to the very top that he is forced to make a giant fall to level up with an actor like Williams when he plays a drama role. This last one is great at comedy, but he also has an audience for the more serious roles (which can still contain some humor) like in Good Will Hunting for example.<br/><br/>Go watch this movie, you won't regret it!

","Ok guys, I too am a Jim Carrey fan from way back....but MAN, he and Shadyac are completely off the rails with this mess!<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes are fine.....vintage Carrey and right up until the Niagara Falls sequence - brilliant. Can't fault the acting, direction, script or general entertainment quotient. Somewhere just beyond the half-way point however..perhaps around the advent of the moon-roping sequence, the film  starts to disintegrate. The makers, obviously using LIAR LIAR as a template, find they haven't the story or depth to sustain what is basically a one-joke film. The fault is not Carrey's in fact he sustains a high level of acting throughout..even when the film is irredeemably lost by the three-quarter mark! Incredibly...BRUCE ALMIGHTY enters into a phase of utter BOREDOM as we are treated to a pseudo-religious sermon that just refuses to kerb its pretension.<br/><br/>One fault - for me at least - was the casting of Jennifer Anniston. Whereas Maura Tierney made such a smart, attractive and cute feminine lead/wife in LIAR LIAR, Ms Anniston looks like a really middle-aged if not totally bedraggled love interest for most of the time..she does absolutely nothing for the picture. The ""highlight"" of the movie...the ""newsreading sequence"" WAS funny admittedly but would even have been more amusing had not Rowan Atkinson done it way better and funnier in JOHNNY ENGLISH.<br/><br/>The last thirty minutes plays out like some out-takes from THE MAJESTIC which also found itself with nowhere to go at a critical point. In summation therefore, I have to agree with so many others who rightly commented that the film could have been soo much better given the premise and yeah...if you've seen the trailer...don't bother with the film!"

","Bruce Almighty: 5/10<br/><br/>I'm a big Jim Carrey fan, so decided to see this the day after opening. The concept was cool, Jim Carrey with the power of God! The execution... not so good. The heights of this movie were TREMENDOUS, I was nearly in tears of laughter at points. But like Just Married (only this was better), there were times where I didn't laugh for a long time, and was so of passively entertained, but not outright enjoying it. With a stronger script, this could have been a classic comedy, because whenever he was given something good, he ran with it and made me laugh hard. Morgan Freeman is typically good, playing a comedic God. Special mention has to go out to Jennifer Aniston for the wrong reasons, as they was absolutely atrocious as Carrey's wife in the movie, coming across as phony with her whiny tone. Overall, it was an okay flick, but very disappointing."

","If you liked Liar Liar you will like this movie.  First of all let me say that I found both Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty extremely funny.  There are many parallels between the two movies. For example, they both:<br/><br/>1. use a fantastic premise to set up most of the comedy<br/><br/>2. are extremely funny for the first half of the film, and have almost no laughs during the last half hour while they wrap up the plot<br/><br/>3. star Jim Carrey<br/><br/>4. feature a love interest played by a female star from an NBC sitcom<br/><br/>5. have a sexy, malicious woman trying to sleep with Jim Carrey<br/><br/>6. end on a syrupy-sweet Capraesque note<br/><br/>7. were directed by the same person, Tom Shadyac<br/><br/>8. show the main character the error of his ways through the absurd premise<br/><br/>9. feature a series of outtakes during the end credits<br/><br/>So while I can appreciate Bruce Almighty on its own I'd like to see a slightly bigger difference between them.  As for picking the better of the two, I think Liar Liar was outrageously funny more often.<br/><br/>There was one scene in this movie were I laughed so hard I cried.  It's just too bad that they had to have a lame plot to string the scenes together. Also there are two scenes in the movie, when Jim is using his Godlike powers, where they seemed to spend a lot of time and money on bits that weren't even funny (tomato soup and Post-It Notes).  In the end there's one undeniable reason to see this movie: Jim Carrey is hilarious."
"Ericho","Null","0","1","28 June 2003"," Nice work, Jim Carrey!
","Jim Carrey has always been one of my favorite actors. He was great in ""The Mask"" and ""Liar, Liar"". I was noticing that recently he's been in more serious movies (""The Truman Show"" ""The Majestic"" etc.) and I was kind of waiting for a classic comedy of his. This funny film is his best comedy since ""Liar, Liar"". Anyway, the film is quite entertaining in my opinion, and offers a very original idea...a human getting God's powers. I kind of think Ebert and Roeper were focusing more on the bad jokes than the good. (I mean, come on! The wind lifting up the lady's skirt was only in like one scene!) Morgan Freeman was very good as God. A very fine actor indeed. I (or at least my dad) was noticing that wierd thing with the signs througout the movie that the poor guy had and how he turned out to be God at the end. I wonder if that ""Armeggadon Outta Here"" sign at the very end, meant ""I'm A Getting Out Of Here"" or something. Yeah, the film was really suttle in its messages.<br/><br/>The idea of someone having a special ability is kind of reminiscent of LL. Anyway, one of my favorite parts was where Bruce was messing up the guy's news report. That was so funny!! The movie also kind of showed you kind of how everything has an effect, and it not always seem as it should be, but we as humans beings should just do as we're meant. Allright, I've probably said enough. A 9/10. Hope you like it!"
"Silverzero","Null","0","1","27 June 2003"," Goofball comedy high on imagination, despite a poor conclusion.
","After hit-and-miss movies like `Man on the Moon' and `The Majestic', it's good to see rubber-faced Jim Carrey back to the genre he does best- screwball comedy. Particularly when the plot is as eye catching and promising as this- a man is given the power of God. This paves the way for plenty of hilarious antics and situations. Just too bad that the opening fifteen- twenty minutes are so slow to get going (bar the hilarious `Niagara Falls' sequence). But after the protagonist receives the power of God, the jokes kick in and the film continues to build more and more momentum as the hilarious scenes pile up. <br/><br/>There are certain scenes that will have you in stitches laughing, but it would be unfair to give them away. I just wish the trailers wouldn't give away so much of them. The subplots are really only a skeleton to keep the movie bound and in place, everything else comes from the gags. The visual effects and trick photography are surprisingly impressive as well. But when you take away all the gags and special effects, the movie is only a bit of gas. Then again, that's all we're really expecting out of it.<br/><br/>
However, there is one simply unforgivable plot-hole that the film falls into. It packs all of the jokes into about into the middle fifty or so minutes and completely runs out of ideas in the third part. It becomes the sentimental `rom-com without the com' that it promised us it wouldn't be. This has happened before in high concept movies like `In & Out' when the blandness of the all-too-serious scenes sets in. That's a terrible shame because, had it had two or three more jokes, or maybe spaced them out a bit more, this would have been a better film. <br/><br/>Thankfully, Jim Carrey is on the top-form that we hoped he'd be in for his long expected return to comedy. No other actor could pull off this part with quite as much flexibility as Carrey does, and he does a great job. The same thing cannot Jennifer Aniston who doesn't prove to be anything the `Rachel Green' that we are very familiar with. Woefully unchallenged and nothing we haven't seen before, this could have easily been pulled off by any other lesser-known actress. Standard support from Philip Baker Hall (Magnolia, The Rock), Catherine Bell and Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Shawshank Redemption) as He Almighty. <br/><br/>It really is a shame that the film shamelessly plummeted into a downward spiral in the final third. But the middle part is undeniably funny; so all in all, this is a funny (if not groundbreaking) comedy movie. My IMDb rating: 6.0/10."

"kgsmith1","7","0","1","27 June 2003"," 8 FOR A JIM CARREY MOVIE?!?
","I kind of questioned myself when I checked in an 8, but the movie is simply that entertaining.<br/><br/>First of all, I don't go into movies looking for something the movie shouldn't be.  This movie is a comedy; so if I can laugh through it and enjoy myself, it has served it's purpose well.  There were plenty of funny scenes in Bruce Almighty, but what really impressed me was the storyline and execution.<br/><br/>For once, a comedy's storyline actually works well and holds interest throughout the movie.  While more could have been done with it, the major points were covered, and everything that needed to be there was fit in within the running time of the movie.<br/><br/>I thought the acting by Carrey was quite good, and Anniston was adequate. Morgan Freeman, as always, played a superb role and it may have influenced my opinion on this movie somewhat because my vision of God is very similar to how Freeman portrays him.  The scene where God asks Bruce to help mop the floor is something I could very well see God doing.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether you believe in the more humorous portrayal of God, it will not damper your interest in this movie.  With a good plot and a lot of laughs, it's a cant-miss for the summer.  If your date is going to drag you to a movie, you can do a LOT worse."

"Tez-9","Null","0","2","25 June 2003"," Pain from so much laughter  A true comedy.
","Reluctantly taking on board certain styles of humour, procrastination leaves me with the only option when I am faced by a film, which casts the arguably proclaimed legend of Slapstick comedy  Jim Carrey.   I am surely not alone. Carrey has a distinct connection with Marmite', a product generating a split in society through a Love Vs Hate barrier.  Ace Ventura; Mask; Cable Guy; Dumb and Dumber; Liar Liar; all left a lot to be desired in my opinion and yet I find myself encountered in debate with friends who obviously dislike Marmite (I personally love it!).  Through the despite lack of enthusiasm I hold for Mr Carrey, I have noticed his style harvesting and maturing into something fascinating.  We now see him taking on scripts, which I can't help think is something he truly feels connected with when the cameras are halted.  Carrey wants to be internally taken seriously, but is often pushed aside because of his blinding appearance which perceivers view as a juvenile type character with ephemeral antics that are almost out of steam.  `Truman Show' relates to my theory; Carrey taking on the more serious role and I agree, very good film plot, but Carrey was missing something and I can't put my finger on it, but he was far from spectacular. Until now of course<br/><br/>Jim Carrey was born to play the character of `Brue Almighty', how often can you say that about an actor?  Frustrated with what life brings him, a job, which could open the door to the pinnacle of success, but yet Bruce feels trapped.  Feeling the unluckiest man alive, it is not surprising that Bruce finds comprehension a little hard to comprehend when confronted with God (Morgan Freeman). Luckily God has a sense of humour and will cast aside the many blasphemous comments Bruce has made to offer him a chance to play God. With every opportunity of changing all his bad luck to good, Bruce faces the undeniable truth that he is his own worst enemy and that is the very reason he has had bad luck for so long.<br/><br/>The elements that will surely make this film a success will not solely depend on Mr Carrey either. Tom Shadyac (director) will now certainly be taking seriously in the film industry after pulling off some cleverly placed camera shots.  Another surprising performance was from Jennifer Aniston, clearly stamping down her mark on the film industry and has in my opinion been the most impressive out of the Friends' cast.  Aniston has the calibre to play someone other than the character Rachel', unlike Matt Le Blanc and Lisa Kudrow respectively.   Morgan Freeman is as outstanding as ever, applying his usual captivation of on-screen appearance and utterly distinguishing voice.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty will undoubtedly cause a storm.<br/><br/>You'll Laugh. You'll Cry. A Classic.<br/><br/>5/5"

However, do not underestimate the influence of Morgan Freeman on your biased opinion. Or of Jennifer Aniston.<br/><br/>Strange as it may seem, the three of them make a pretty good team here; Carrey as the reporter with no job perspectives, Aniston as his girlfriend for 5 years who loves him to death no matter what, and Freeman as (to my knowledge) the first African American to appear as God in a film. Both Carrey and Aniston have already done their share of comedies, but it's obviously a treat for Freeman, because he's either having a ball or acting really well that he is. Still, Carrey pulls it off again and launches a new batch of jokes, body movements, facial expressions and impersonations. Aniston is a slight miscast but makes the most of it using her looks and improvisation techniques she developed on ""Friends"". The storyline is pretty thin, but the concept is refreshing. The real movie addicts will notice a couple of winks to other movies (Groundhog Day - the puddle incident, The Truman Show - the fresh coffee from the hills of Colombia).

He then gets dumped by his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston), and wonders if he can handle all of God's responsibilities or not. That's all I'm going to tell you.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a good movie. Lots of funny moments and an interesting plot. It has your typical cheesy, predictable romance subplot, of course. And overall, I thought, the movie is preachy. It just is.

","This should probably be a fine vehicle for Jim Carrey--a hard-luck soft-news anchor is given the reins while God takes a vacation--and his enormous comedic skills are very much in evidence (which alone makes it worth recommending) but there seems to be a bit too much restraint and tidiness on display, a classic example of Universal Studio's sanitized version of America; ostensibly set in Buffalo, it could be Anywhere U.S.A. as long as it's the spotless, W.A.S.P. Anywhere U.S.A. the studio insists on force-feeding the world. (The fact that God is played by African-American Morgan Freeman seems meant to throw us off the track but doesn't--God may be black but He apparently has little interest in anyone other than His white followers.) Carrey throws himself into the project, capitalizing on the apparent desperation he's exhibiting while trying to recover from his disappointing serious work (`The Truman Show', `Man In The Moon') and his physical comedy has never been better; but while it's a pleasure to watch a master craftsman at work, the material he's given works only sporadically, most notably in extended scenes such as an on-air meltdown at Niagara Falls and his tormenting of the anchor who's passed him over for the top job. (The anchor is nicely played by Steven Carell, displaying the same crack timing as Carrey.) While Carrey makes the movie worthwhile, the overall pacing is slack, thanks to the lackluster direction by Tom Shadyac, who, as in films such as `The Nutty Professor', prefers to just point the camera and let his stars bring him the glory."

"Forests","6","0","1","12 June 2003"," A Genuine Person Would Not Waste Absolute Power Like That
","This movie created an idea that a screenwriter with vision and important messages could have used.  Absolute power in ""Bruce Almighty"" is wasted on a misanthrope.  The movie fails to explain how the source of all wisdom could lend its power to get things done to someone that hates his rivals and opponents.  <br/><br/>Most irritating is the depiction of God disapproving of Nolan when he says his greatest wishes are that no person go hungry and that all mankind live in peace.  The Morgan Freeman God retorts that he is not a candidate in the Miss America contest and asks him to wish for something he really wants.  I heard a ranting political conservative in the background persuading the screenwriter to portray a God who is trusts only those so egotistic that they are incapable of emotions for people outside their own individual experience.  <br/><br/>Perhaps Carol caadison, among others, is right: it is just a silly movie, to get a few laughs, to escape some daily grind.  I just think that escapism is already plentiful in American movies.  This was a theological idea of enormous potential.  Why does the leading critic, Roger Ebert, claim he is incapable of contemplating the theology?  Who cannot fail to perceive that God, by definition, whether actual or not, within His domain, is good?  That this serious oversight significantly detracts from the humor of ""Bruce Almighty""?"

"casey_choas66","Null","0","1","10 June 2003"," *** out of 5
","Jim Carrey provides a cynical look at misanthropy in its cutest form in his new film Bruce Almighty. Carrey stars as Bruce, a one joke, goof-off reporter in a one-joke, goof-off film about graciousness, free will and the existence of a supposed higher power, which will be seen as a return to grace for already converted Carry Fans, and an embarrassment to all other outsiders.  It's hard to access movies like these. They fuel themselves on many formations of the same ilk and hope that the audience is to distracted by the maniacal nature of the burden than the un-honest nature of it of it. But because this is a piece tailor made to suit the star characteristics of Carrey and not address the character of Bruce as a general individual, I suppose no more is to be expected from such circumstances. Now that all attention is on track I suppose it is time to indulge ourselves in the joke at hand. After being fired for a stream of obscenity, broadcast on live television, Bruce finds himself jobless and having one of the worst days of his life. He blames his toil on all but the obvious, himself. He then finds himself face to face with that of who he cured for his misfortune, God (played in one of the film's most ironic twists by Morgan Freeman, who left me with a thought. If God were a white man would he wear a black suit?) Thinking that it's any idiot's game, Bruce is given the power of God and told to make the world a better place. The premise to this film is intriguing I must concur with that, probably possessing the most comedic potential the big screen has seen since the pairing of Adam Sandler and Jack Nichelson in Anger Management. And just like Anger Management, sees almost all but a small portion of that potential wash away in the name of its star's profile. That's not to say that Bruce Almighty is a bad film, it presents a fare share of laughs. There is a scene paying homage to Dirty Harry, a tribute to Jimmy Stewart in which Bruce draws the moon close and paints his girlfriend the stars. There is also one of the films greatest gags in which Bruce parts the `red' sea in such a way to wet even the appetite of Charlton Heston (pun indented). To truly appreciate the wild antics of Jim Carrey one must almost venture back to the grounds that they once spawned from. During this film I was reminded of a scene in the war room from Dr Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb in which the George C. Scott character is supposed to point to the map on the wall but tumbles backward instead. This scene has been said to be of complete unintentional temperament, if so heightening the impact of the scene as a whole. I think of this not because Bruce Almighty pales in comparison to a classic like Dr. Strangelove, but because it makes me wonder how much of Carrey's on screen persona is actually devised into the written script. Maybe Carrey is of much more talent than we all give him credit for? Since we are on the topic of Carrey already I think it only fit to discuss his performance. As an actor Carrey has always made distinctively safe career moves. He plays likeable losers who we don't mind seeing go through a little struggle because in the end you know you will be cheering for them anyway. With the acceptation of Man In the Moon, a film that I would expect no one of eluding to except for Andy Kaufman himself. This film bears no foible in the formula. Carrey is either at his best here, or his most annoying, I assure myself that there is probably very little difference between the two. He presents outbursts of stupidity that you believe some people are capable of but never image anyone doing it until you have witnessed it at eye level. It really only serves as a deterrent from what the film is actually trying to be, something I was willing to let myself become interested in but couldn't due to these unexplained hysterics.  Then we have Morgan Freeman as God, probably a step down from Alanis Morissette as God in Kevin Smith's controversial mess of a film Dogma, but still up there on the irony scale. But Freeman works in his role because he is a natural character actor, never one to shy away from a risk or two. His plays his role with a subdued state of graciousness (he seems almost as interested in getting his floor clean than looking after the world) and an attractive charm. He hits every line with the subtle conviction that one would not expect from such a character, but can't help but resist from such an actor. And still there is that meandering feeling of discontent, how can you praise something for only being what you would expect? There is not very often that a comedy comes along and changes the rules, only to rewrite them in a formal method to fit their utter originality. Such films consist of Animal House, Fargo, and most recently There's Something About Marry. The reason these films not only shaped a genre, but also propelled in to be something else was that they never let the action become lower than the material itself. They are constant and persistent, never becoming out of focus of misdirected, they see their target and aim directly for it. These days comedy is not content on itself, it strays in a wayward fashion, trying to provoke more than it should, and attempting to become something that it wasn't indented to be. That may just be Bruce Almighty's greatest flaw. This is a film that tries to teach that free will equals happiness, not power and that life isn't very fun if you don't earn the right for it to be, but becomes lost in a barrage of potty humour and manufactured sap. I will give credit though, once the film finds itself in the end it does become a touching experience, not in its realism, but in its friendly nature. But then again, in this day and age what comedy doesn't present a touching ending? There is no law in comedy stating that the material has to go somewhere, one of the best films of last summer was an under rated little comedy entitled Barbershop, but there is a reliance that it will take its audience somewhere. I've seen penis jokes, I've seen bathroom jokes, and I've seen journalist in-jokes all done before, comedy should be an experience of something unimaginable not a retread of the already elaborated. Don't get me wrong, Bruce Almighty is by no means a bad film, it is just a film that has nothing overtly likable about it, especially when it is backed by such a strong opinionated topic for exploration. The highlight of the film is almost certainly the direction from Tom Shadyac (who was also at the helm of such great Carrey performances in both Ace Ventura and Liar Lair). Shadyac presents one of the films greatest scenes in such originality; it disappointed me that it wasn't in a film that would appreciate it. The scene sees Bruce walking on top of a body of water with the camera looking up from beneath the waves at Carrey, a shot symbolizing a new found power in the balance but the ever-so-slight blurring of reality, a great shot to accent the films meanings. The special effects of the other hand are a mixed bag at best. On one side of the spectrum the sea parting scene is done with style and hilarity, yet everything else appears to be scammed right out of a Sunday afternoon children's matinee. When all is over and done with Bruce Almighty may have been something, but not that something that it had set out to be. It loses its morals on religion and plays things safe with stupid sight gags when I expect comedy of a deeper intellect. I thought I was getting myself into a film that would break boundaries and have something to say about the state of mind people seem to be stuck in during this present time. I also expect to see Carrey break free and give safety and push himself in the right direction. What I received was a mediocre collaboration of half-truths and recycled bits that didn't have enough integrity to make it into the smart comedies, but hey, that's the way the cookie crumbles."

","At one point in this movie - as Bruce (Jim Carrey) gets his revenge on Evan (Steven Carell) - I was almost rolling around on the floor of the theatre in tears, the scene was so funny. That one scene alone made it worthwhile to see this movie, but having said that there's far more to this movie than one funny scene. It is a well-put together, well directed and well acted movie which is very funny and yet at the same time manages to address some very serious philosophical and theological questions along the way.<br/><br/>The story is surprisingly (and misleadingly) simple. Bruce is always complaining that God never gives him a break, so God (played extremely well by Morgan Freeman) decides to teach him a lesson by letting Bruce play God for a while. Bruce is given two restrictions on his power: you can't fool with free will (and I'm embarrassed to admit that I can't remember the second.) For a while Bruce finds his new powers fun, but then discovers the challenges. One person's free will can impact negatively on another's, and there's nothing even God - who grants free will out of love - can do about it. When Bruce finally sets himself to the task of trying to help others rather than just amuse himself, he also discovers that saying ""yes"" to every prayer (which so many people seem to think God should do) doesn't work very well, because some people's prayers contradict others. As a clergyman, I thought these points were made well - in a humourous vein, but noting the seriousness of the issue.<br/><br/>There were only a couple of things in the movie that didn't appeal to me. As I said, I can only remember one of the two conditions God placed on Bruce's use of His powers, but I am sure that one of them was NOT ""you have to use your power to help other people."" And yet, after Bruce amuses himself for a while, God comes to him and lectures him because he hasn't used his powers to help others. Huh? That was not one of the conditions. God became inconsistent in that moment. Also a note abut Jim Carrey: he is a very funny actor who falls into the trap of over-acting. He should let his humour flow a little more naturally. Sometimes he comes across as forced.<br/><br/>However, this is a great movie (also featuring a good performance from Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's girlfriend Grace.)<br/><br/>8/10"

God played by Morgan Freeman responds by giving Nolan his powers for a week to see if he can do things any better. The film then takes off in the usual comedic fashion as Nolan tries to right his own life while ignoring god's other duties. <br/><br/>    There were some particularly humorous moments as Nolan works to fix his work and love life. As expected, Nolan's new powers get the better of him and the world suffers as a result. Of course, all of Bruce's efforts fail to keep him together with his teacher girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. In the end, Bruce is forced to learn that even the powers of god cannot stop human free will."

","Jim is back, and better than ever!  I'm glad Jim Carrey has explored more dramatic roles.  Although not as entertaining or profitable, his more serious acting endeavors have clearly allowed him to refine his unique talents.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty showcases a perfect balance of touching drama and hillarious comedy in his peculiar style.  Emotional moments are just long enough to make things personal, and short enough to break up the laughter so as to give your ribs much needed rest.<br/><br/>Aside from a little profanity, which actually fits the situations, it's a very clean film (contemporarily speaking).  It's not a deeply religious film, and it doesn't come off overly preachy.  God is God; not a one-size-fits-all, nameless, genderless being.  He's Morgan Freeman, and there is no more comfortable guy in all the universe.<br/><br/>The movie promotes common-sense spirituality, such as taking responsibility for the bad and good in life (rather than blaming God), praying to God earnestly and personally, and lightening up (a message present day clergy should pay attention to).  Surprisingly, the feel-good messages do not have a plastic feel; they're sensible and thought provoking.  One gets a sense that maybe God isn't such a big party-pooper after all.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston's performance is excellent.  She makes the movie work by showing the unfair effects of Bruce's selfish behavior on her innocent character.  She gets to display a much wider range of her acting talent than TV roles permit.<br/><br/>God's vocation provides the framework of the movie, but the story has more to do with situational comedy and drama; a series of errors and their consequences.  It answers the question we all daydream about: What would you do if you had God's powers?  Answer: You'd adjust things to your liking, settle scores, and do good deeds from your limited perspective; basically screw everything up!<br/><br/>If this film doesn't delight you and make you ponder your attitude, there's something fundamentally wrong inside of you.  Go see it with your family and friends!"
"iron_teacher","Null","0","1","27 May 2003"," Half good, half mush
","This movie felt like it might have been written for Jim Carrey and his recent schizophrenic cinematic behavior. The first half is almost constantly hilarious, with some scenes that milk the laughs longer than you might think possible, and they are very effective in said milking! This is actually in part because of the supporting actor Phillip Baker Hall's very tight performance. At the height of the film's energy (about 35 minutes into it) Carrey is at his best. Problem is, the movie takes a pedagogical turn soon after that peak and the rest is overly dramatic mush. True, the lesson Carrey's character learns is valuable, but the laughs are few and far between while he is learning it. Carrey again shows that he can handle dramatic material quite well. He is not as good as he was in The Truman Show or Man in the Moon, but he is at about the same good level as he was in The Majestic. He certainly emotes well, but, and this is interesting, he is unable to use his body convincingly in these more dramatic scenes. He is the master of comedic body work, but has yet to learn to use the body and its motions to communicate the depth of emotion involved in the dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>In any case, the movie is well worth at least the price of a matinee ticket, and it is refreshing to see Carrey take his place again as the king of physical, farcical comedy.  It would be great to see him take that talent all the way through a movie again, like he did in Liar, Liar so well."

"ruby_fff","7","0","1","1 June 2003"," Jim Carrey is back in his elements as Jim Carrey does.
","Recently I saw Julien Temple's ""Earth Girls Are Easy"" (1989) on cable and enjoyed all over again the riotous comedic tempo of the alien trio: Jeff Goldblum, Jim Carrey and Damon Wayans, with the infectious Valley girl portrayal of Valerie by Geena Davis. I remember I first appreciate Jim Carrey in ""The Mask"" (1994) with the talented Cameron Diaz in her debut role.     <br/><br/>""Bruce Almighty"" is a parable without a doubt. Jim Carrey back in his elements, with partners in fun - Jennifer Aniston as Grace the girlfriend desirable, and Morgan Freeman as God the friend indispensable. Together they delivered an entertaining tale about how Carrey's character Bruce eventually learned his life lessons and became the model citizen aspired by all. Yes, the comedic tempo basically is 'driven' by the manic energy of Carrey's, but both Freeman and Aniston contributed their subtle humorous touches with just the right dosage to the mix. It was amusing watching the trio, and (not forgetting) the dog, along with the supporting cast, making this Tom Shadyac movie another Hollywood hit.  <br/><br/>Director Tom Shadyac's other endeavors include: Patch Adams (1998), a rather serious film with Robin Williams - another manic energy unlimited; and The Nutty Professor (1996 remake) with Eddie Murphy - yet another genius in hilarity.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is a prolific actor since his famous role as Miss Daisy's chauffeur opposite Jessica Tandy in Bruce Beresford's ""Driving Miss Daisy"" (1989). I found his two 'Charlie' roles most delightful: he was Charlie in Neil LaBute's ""Nurse Betty"" (2000) opposite RenÃ©e Zellweger and co., and as Charlie Grimes opposite Ashley Judd in Carl Franklin's ""High Crimes"" (2002).<br/><br/>
I first appreciate Jennifer Aniston's acting in Edward Burns' ""She's The One"" (1996). She carried the central roles in Glenn Gordon Caron's ""Picture Perfect"" (1997) opposite Jay Mohr; Nicholas Hytner's ""The Object of My Affection"" (1998) opposite Paul Rudd; and Miguel Arteta's ""The Good Girl"" (2002) opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and co. She gave steady supporting roles to Mark Wahlberg in Stephen Herek's ""Rock Star"" (2001), and to Ron Livingston in Mike Judge's ""Office Space"" (1999).<br/><br/>Jim Carrey's more serious drama roles include: Frank Darabont's ""The Majestic"" (2001) opposite Martin Landau and co.; Peter Weir's ""The Truman Show"" (1998) opposite Ed Harris, Laura Linney and co.; and the controversial dark menacing role of the cable guy opposite Matthew Broderick in Ben Stiller's ""The Cable Guy"" (1996)."
"Sfpsycho415","7","0","1","1 June 2003"," Best Carrey flick since Liar, Liar---7/10
","Although i liked Liar, Liar a little more than Bruce Almighty, that doesn't make this a bad film. It is a hilarious comedy starring one of the funniest men alive. Jim Carrey stars as Bruce, a down on his luck news reporter who begins to blame God for all his misfortune. Then God contacts him and gives Bruce his powers to show him how hard being the master of the universe is. Jim Carrey is laugh out loud funny in this movie. His mix of physical comedy and comedic dialogue is great. Some of the funniest parts in the movie are scenes of him ranting about about how God ignores him or snapping on live television and insulting everyone. Morgan Freeman plays the man upstairs and Jennifer Aniston plays Bruce's girlfriend. They both have some funny moments, but Carrey steals the show as always. 7/10"

The story was good enough, not brilliant, but it did have some surprises with a few lines and actions catching me off guard.<br/><br/>This is not a movie about religion and it barely touches the subject, however it does deliver a clear message towards the end, which was pleasing.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 7/10 simply because I was entertained, had a smile on my face for most of the time, laughed out more than a couple of times, and completely forgot I had children for nearly two hours (parents will understand this).

","I went expecting to be outraged at the ""fun and goofs"" they were going to have at God's expense, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only was it not blasphemous, it actually could strengthen one's faith in the higher power. There were several scenes that were very deep in spiritual meaning, even if delivered thru the most annoyingly silly actor in Hollywood. Now granted, Jim Carrey is way over the top in this one sometimes (even by Jim Carrey standards), but move past it, laugh at some toilet humor, and be sure and catch the deeper meaning!<br/><br/>If you're going just to laugh at someone talking out of their butt or hitting themselves in the head with a hammer, then you've chosen the wrong picture. But if you appreciate a little thinking man's humor (yes I said ""Jim Carrey"" and ""thinking man"" in the same paragraph), then come off the hip and see this one!"
"jchory","Null","0","1","31 May 2003"," Carrey preaching the gospel, strange mix, but neat movie!
","I love Jim Carrey, but the trailer bugged me a bit -- Yikes! Looked a little blasphemous to me.  And with my viewpoint as a conservative Christian, I guess it was a bit sacreligious.  But as my aunt used to say when I was growing up, ""sometimes we've just got to close our ears during the bad parts"".<br/><br/>So, that's what I did and I have to say -- I loved this movie!  It addressed a lot of real questions, such as -- What would happen if you could get ANYTHING you want -- would it really make you happy?  Do you have to die to your old life to live a new one?  Is it really better to give than receive? Is God really punishing me when things go bad?  How do you get someone to love without messing with the free will thing? and on and on.<br/><br/>
I was stimulated mentally and laughed my head off.  I give it 9 out of 10. (P.S. Like the way Albert Hitchcock had a ""trademark"" cameo appearance, I think Carrey has developed a ""trademark"" of ""accidently"" sticking his butt in someone's face at least once in each of most of his movies.)"

","Jim Carrey surpasses himself in his role as Bruce Nolan, an often-egotistical newscaster whose life takes a nose-dive, and in his passion over his misfortune, says that ""the only one who's not doing his job is you!"" to God. God responds by giving Bruce all his powers, and taking a vacation. Nolan finds out just what he is capable of, and just what the responsibilities of being the Almighty are, and finds himself overwhelmed. Excellent performances all around, a very funny and surprisingly deep film."
"tom-760","7","0","1","26 May 2003"," Very entertaining film
","I had seen various trailers for this movie, and I liked the premise and had high hopes that it would be an enjoyable movie.  I was a little worried that it might border on heresy, but it looked like it would be very funny.  I was not disappointed.  The movie was quite enjoyable from start to finish.<br/><br/>As for the heresy part - I was certainly not offended in the least by the portrayal of God in this film.  While I certainly don't think God would ever turn his powers over to someone like Bruce, everything else about the way Morgan Freeman portrayed God was perfectly acceptable, and in fact I thought his was the best performance of the movie.<br/><br/>While some felt the message of this movie was sappy or overdone, I really liked it.  I really don't have a problem with a comedy trying to be something more than just humor, in fact I appreciate it when a movie of any genre tries to encourage people to be more than what they are.  The message about prayer in this film was dead on, IMHO.<br/><br/>One final comment, the news anchor scene with Steven Carell was one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen in any movie.  I laughed so hard that it hurt (and so did most everyone else in the theater), and there are only a few comedy sequences I can ever remember that even approach that.  That scene alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Tom"

"claws0922","8","0","1","25 May 2003"," Carrey is just right
","I really wanted to like this movie. However, I admit I was worried that all the good stuff was in the trailer. My fears were laid to rest in the first 10 minutes, and I settled in to Carrey's best movie since Liar Liar.<br/><br/>
Jim Carrey seems to have finally found the line where being too zany hurts his work, and he does not cross it here. His Bruce Nolan character is very believable and a likeable guy. He doesn't dream of being a big star in New York, he'll settle for Buffalo. I thought his reactions to not getting the anchor job, and his general feeling of ""God is against me"" were right on target and something a lot of us go through at times. I'm not saying Carrey shouldn't do straight drama, but this type of film his obviously his niche.<br/><br/>I do not, however, want to forget Jennifer Anniston. I've read some reviews that have basically said ""well, she's not bad for the film, just not good for it either"". I disagree. Yes she's beautiful, but in my opinion she's got an every woman quality to her that make her seem like someone you could know. I believe she's got a long, lucrative film career ahead of her.<br/><br/>Finally let me add these things:<br/><br/><ul><li>If God really is the way Morgan Freeman portrays him we're all gonna be ok. - Catherine Bell is gorgeous and I think she'd be a great bad girl/seductress in a film even more so than she is here. -Everyone should give proper credit to Steven Carrell for the on-air scene where Bruce messes with him. An awesome bit of comedy.</li></ul>"

He seems to have very little control.  Jennifer Anniston shows she may be ready for movie stardom, otherwise not worth 2 hours."

","Jim Carrey's role in Bruce reminded me in some ways of his role in The Truman Show: He plays a lighthearted, joy-giving TV personality in a movie which touches on issues of the divine and free will. Perhaps Carrey enjoys these roles; I certainly think he is funny and I liked his role in Bruce, just as I liked his role in The Truman Show.<br/><br/>I also thought Jennifer Aniston did well as Grace, devoted (and devout) and tender partner to Bruce.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was well put together, featuring humor and sensitivity. Aniston's character goes through quite a range of emotions with respect to her relationship with Bruce. Jim Carrey, though, carries the film with his humor, passion, sensitivity and his portrayal of a character with an innocent love of life."

He lives with his girlfriend, Grace, who runs a daycare sort of place, and loves to give blood, but it gives Bruce the creeps. Now anyway, he's a reporter for Channel 7 news and he hasn't yet gotten a live TV show. Though he's funny, people don't give him the job that he needs.<br/><br/>So, though he's actually very lucky, he sees himself as very, very unlucky. Every now and then, he tries to talk to God, saying something like, ""Why me, God?! Why me?"" And then he starts getting phone calls from the # 776-2323. (Don't ask--It would probably be 666 if the devil was calling him--I love Bedazzled!!!) So finally, he calls the number and they tell him, come down to our address and you'll get what you want. So he goes down there and he meets God--Morgan Freeman--and God says, ""You know what? You can have all my powers. But there are two rules: 1. You cannot mess with free will, and 2. You cannot tell other people that you are God.""<br/><br/>So naturally Bruce tries to make everything better for himself, and occasionally Grace, and of course, messes up such as -While moving the moon for Grace to enjoy it, he causes a meteorite to fall onto Earth. -He makes his enemy fart, talk nonsense, talk stuff like, ""Today I took a s*** in my panties."", which is hilarious.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a must see.<br/><br/>9/10 *********"

"Shakespeare-2","Null","0","1","27 May 2003"," Silly yet saintly
","The trailers (or previews) for ""Bruce Almighty"" led me to believe that it would be a frivolous frolic, full of toilet and tit-and-ass humor. And indeed it was. But the film turned out to be much more than an exercise in excess. It proved to be a movie with a message and a meaning. ""Bruce Almighty"" starts out silly -- but ends up saintly.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey stars as Bruce Nolan, a TV reporter who yearns to advance beyond feel-good human-interest items to more serious (and prestigious) news coverage as an anchorman. He fails to appreciate the things he already has, not least of which is his girlfriend, Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston). God finally steps in, embodied by Morgan Freeman. He gives Bruce his powers and takes a little holiday Himself.<br/><br/>Predictably, Bruce uses God's powers in all kinds of piddling and picayune ways, such as parting a bowl of soup like the Red Sea in ""The Ten Commandments"". But he starts hearing voices in his head -- the unanswered prayers of the world, or at least his immediate neighborhood. First, he tries to make sense out of the voices by organizing them. (The Post-It note sequence is priceless.)<br/><br/>Then he tries to make the voices go away by granting all of the things people pray for. But he soon learns that people should be careful what they wish for, and that his actions have dire consequences. As Tobey Maguire said in ""Spiderman"", ""With great power comes great responsibility.""<br/><br/>In the end, Bruce learns to value the humble but happy life he has always had. And he learns that being God is not about performing cheap magic tricks with the universe. It is about loving creatures who are free not to love Him back. It is also about teaching human beings that, like Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"", they themselves have the power to answer their prayers. Or, as Gandhi put it, to ""be the change that you want to see in the world"".<br/><br/>Deeply religious people might take offence at some of the jokes in ""Bruce Almighty"". But that shouldn't stop them from seeing the film. Ultimately, its moral theology and philosophy of prayer are as sound and firm as the house built on rock in the gospels. As for non-believers, they may quibble with the medium -- but they can't find fault with the message."

","Movie's aight, got some funny scenes, but drags on way too long with the serious stuff... can't make Carrey try to act normally, don't buy it, gotta have a character that's on all the time, like in Ace Ventura, that's when Carrey's his funniest, in short skits where he plays outrageous characters and he's gotta be crazy all the time.  Now Carrey's too old, he can't play anybody but himself, how'd he think he could play straight roles, Truman show sucked, his other recent movies, can't even name 'em, they suck.  Bruce Almighty's pretty lame too, but Carrey can still be funny... Jennifer Aniston's in it too, her best movie was Office Space, she was hot in that, but she's getting old too, in her late thirties?

"Thomps2525","10","0","1","25 May 2003"," Funny but perpetuates a myth
","""Bruce Almighty"" is clever, funny, thought-provoking, and filled with Bible-based sight gags that will easily be overlooked by those who aren't familiar with God's Word. Morgan Freeman's portrayal of God was done as righteously (pun intended) as a human could do it. I won't spoil the ending, but there are lessons learned about God and prayer and power, lessons that should far outweigh anyone's fears that the film is sacrilegious or blasphemous. My only complaint involved a reference to someone being ""frozen stiff"" like Walt Disney. This gag just perpetuates the myth that began shortly after Walt's death in 1966. Walt's body was not frozen but was cremated and interred in a Forest Lawn cemetery. Shame on the filmmakers!"

","This was good; I enjoyed it. But it wasn't good enough. This is the first film from Jim Carey that has been worse than I expected. Previously Jim Carey's films have seemed a bit cheesy from the trailers but the films have turned out really well. This one was the other way around.<br/><br/>Although morality is difficult to avoid with such a strong religious theme, the film got too moral too soon. I don't really mind having a religious theme, but this presented with a detriment to the comedy. Not enough fun was had with Bruce's new powers, and as a result, the funniest part of the whole film ended up being the out-takes during the credits.<br/><br/>A good film, but not great."

","Occasionally, I've been known to utter things like ""If I were in charge,"" and I must admit the idea of power is appealing I will equally admit that I am not capable of handling such powers as Bruce is given in this movie. We're all very fortunate that it wasn't me.<br/><br/>That being said, we could have done worse than have God imbue Bruce with omnipotence. Naturally, with Carrey, hilarity ensues. But there is a great, and important, message in ""Bruce Almighty,"" that being: be content and nobody (even God) is out to ""get you."" The idea that God would give such power to a mortal as a ""lesson"" is great, and mankind not being to worldly the sort of messed up things that happen are pretty plausible--even if it is a comedy. <br/><br/>I don't see this as an attack on beliefs, and I don't see this as your average Jim Carrey movie either; it's a little bit more than that. And that makes it more worthy of viewing than any other Jim Carrey movie to date. Sufficiently so that I believe I can say this might be his best work (even more so than The Truman Show.)<br/><br/>Solid ""6"" out of ""10."" There's a good story and it's pretty funny too.

","I either like or hate Jim Carrey.  I thought ""The Mask"" was genius, completely enjoyed ""Liar, Liar"", ""The Majestic"" was good, but I haven't liked most of Carrey's other flix.  I was not looking forward to ""Bruce Almighty"".  Still, when my wife and I got the opportunity to attend the world premiere of the movie earlier this week right here in Buffalo, I found myself very pleasantly surprised.  The movie was very, very funny. Despite myself, I was laughing nearly all the time.  There were moments of over-the-top mugging, but they were blessedly short.  Carrey's character hit close to home - who of us hasn't had ""one of those days"" and felt God wasn't on our side.  Jennifer Aniston, provided a real character far from her Rachel personna, and was lovely to look at besides.  I've heard Morgan Freeman doesn't want to discuss his portrayal of GOD, but I think he handled it well - far differently and with more humor than others who have attempted the same role.  Supporting cast was good especially the fellow who played the news anchor whose job Carrey's character felt he should have - the news broadcast scene is howl.  All round a fun movie with humor and a message - I recommend it.  It's a shame neither Carrey nor Aniston attended the premiere - but then again this is Buffalo and much as for Carrey's character, Buffalo gets no respect.  4 of 5 stars."
"stevefisher","8","0","1","25 May 2003"," Wow! Jim Carrey's best.
","This is a very difficult movie to pin down. Odds are you've seen the trailers so you have a basic idea already, so I'm not really going to describe the plot.<br/><br/>Bruce Almighty is a funny story, but it is not devoid of drama and emotional impact. It really is a better balanced movie than anything he's done so far.<br/><br/>This movie takes a share of the craziness of the original Ace Ventura, adds a bit of The Mask's over-the-top physical jokes, slides in the an approachable, lovable everyman like we saw in The Truman Show, and adds (at last!) a mature romance. The result is somehow much more than the sum of the parts, and is fresh despite the influences of previous movies. Unless you need a high dosage of ass-talking or toilet humor in a Carrey movie, I think you'll find that this is him at his best. Something I really don't think we've seen before.<br/><br/>I really hope this is a sign of good things to come from him."

","This movie is not a dramatic masterpiece by any standards, but it accomplishes its goal-- it makes people laugh.  There are jokes for everyone, from nose-picking jokes for younger kids (not a recommended movie for that crowd due to language, however) to little inside jokes that only certain people will get.  The people in the theater around me were gasping for air at some points.  And yes, it does have a cute ending, storybook perfection, but it seems the only way to end it.  I would definitely recommend this movie if you're in the mood for slapstick comedy (Steven Carell and Jim Carrey both are incredibly good physical comedians) and general all-around cuteness.  It's worth seeing in theaters, if just to see Jim Carrey back in his element."
"movieguy1021","6","0","1","24 May 2003"," Bruce Almighty: 6/10
","Bruce Almighty has more continuity errors than an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants. Most have to do with the ending, so I won't spoil them, although I'll guess that you will be able to tell what the ending will be. It has its moments, some very good ones at that, but it can't seem to get over its cocky tones. It seems like a vehicle to get Jim Carrey back on target, teamed up with director Tom Shadyac again (Ace Ventura, Liar Liar), and an easy $100 million or so for Universal, and a possibility for a sequel.<br/><br/>Anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past two months knows the plot: man revolts against God; man gets God's powers. That man is Bruce Nolan (Carrey), angry that the anchor position at his news station didn't go to him. He's just a lowly reporter who has to get into ridiculous outfits. After he curses God once too often, God Himself (Morgan Freeman) turns up and gives Bruce the chance to have His powers, to see if Bruce can do it better. At first, Bruce uses them to his advantage, but must learn to cope with them.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey can be funny when he wants to be, and he can also be a good actor when he wants to be. He returns to his mid-90's slapstick, while incorporating his acting from The Truman Show, and, dare I say it, The Majestic? Although the humor isn't as broad as his earlier work, and the acting isn't as strong, there's still good doses of both. There's as much crude humor as one-liners.<br/><br/>However, Bruce Almighty can't keep away from the clichÃ©s. Bruce can't climb up the ladder, his pretty girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston) is a kind preschool teacher, his coworkers are mean, et cetera. If that wasn't bad enough, it also tries to be another `classic' Carrey movie. There's a new `catchphrase' (B-E-A-utiful, which it REALLY stupid), and there's symbolism and meaningful characters and objects that just keep on popping in for no reason, like the prayer bracelet and the bum.<br/><br/>Something that always strikes me as odd is all of the complaints against the film. It seems that movies like The Last Temptation of Christ, Dogma, and now Bruce Almighty have Christians boycotting the film for `mocking God.' As the saying goes, God has a sense of humor, look at the platypus. It's just extra marketing and publicity.<br/><br/>It had some pretty funny scenes, and at times the laughs were pretty big. I don't, however, understand why the audience was cracking up at the `seven fingers' joke (it's just like `You've got me straight trippin', boo,' from Bringing Down the House). I thought that most scenes were funny, except for the last quarter, when the laughs slowed dramatically. Also, I thought that the cinematography was surprisingly good for a slob comedy like this. It worked best when Bruce was `parting the Red Sea.'<br/><br/>Could Jim Carrey be coming back to what made him famous? Could Morgan Freeman be billed higher for being in about three scenes? Will Jennifer Aniston ever be cast in a role other than the `cute girlfriend'? We may find out as Universal will probably release Bruce Almighty 2: Heavens Above!<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for language, sexual content and some crude humor."

However, at the same time, I could here the redneck bible belt panicking and the state of Utah flipping out at the notion of God being anything but that lily white guy we always see depicted.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston, dolly that she is, was often lost in the mix.

We can never go on life on our own and we must rely on (or humble ourselves to) a higher power, particularly God, however, God is portrayed negatively in this film as one of those ""playful Gods"" who like to pick on people.  There is little or no emphasis on Christ and Redemption.  Bruce Nolan (Carrey) and his girlfriend, Grace, are shacked up together in sin and yet, God chooses to ""bless"" them.  Bruce uses a couple of ungodly vocabulary, including the f-word.  Still, Grace continues to pray for Bruce's well-being and Bruce manages to sum up a good prayer.  Jim Carrey is still funny, with his unique comedic style, complete with stupid-funny antics.  I give this ** out of **** stars."

","Tom Shadyac and Jim Carrey, make an excellent director-leading actor team. TS directed Jim Carrey in Liar Liar and i enjoy that movie everytime i see it. Bruce Almighty is pleasant and Jim Carrey plays the role very well. He is God Almighty, having been given these powers by the Almighty Himself played very well by Morgan Freeman. The movie starts off very well, showing Bruce Nolan and Grace Connelly ( played by Jennifer Aniston)as a happy live-in couple very much in love with each other. But Bruce has problems. He has dreams of achievement and success at work. He aspires for the anchorman position with local television channel in Buffalo. But he loses. Now, he is miserable because he does not get what he wants from God only because God is ignoring him and not because God has forgotten him. because he is angry with God, God gives him the power to be God for sometime. And then Bruce turns quiet, happy, simple  Buffalo residents  into a rambunctious crowd by doing a poor job of answering all prayers without paying heed to what the prayers were all about. Now, Bruce realizes that God does have a very difficult job of keeping everyone happy. So, he relinquishes his authority to God.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is my favorite comedian and never bores me. His actions are apt. His facial contortions are exquisite. One can see practically every muscle in his neck when he makes his famous faces. Jennifer Aniston as his girl-friend is good. She has shown maturity in her acting in the last 3 films i have seen ( all 3 made after her marriage to Brad Pitt), Rockstar, The Good Girl ( my favorite) and now this movie. She has definitely come a long way after making movies like Picture perfect. Morgan Freeman as the Almighty is gentle, nice and good. He has consistently shown his talents in all his movies. This movie is definitely a pleasant treat for a long weekend."

You know, those movies where the trailers reveal the only funny parts in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised with ""Bruce Almighty."" I don't think I've laughed so hard in a long time.<br/><br/>Jim Carrey is teriffic as Bruce Nolan, a down-on-his-luck Buffalo lighter side of the news reporter trying desperately to get an anchor's job. I also enjoyed the performance of Jennifer Aniston in this film as Bruce's girlfriend, Grace. Aniston has proven with this, last year's ""The Good Girl"" and the funny ""Office Space"" that she has nicely evolved from TV to the big screen.  Morgan Freeman is PERFECT in this movie as God. I don't think they could have found anyone else to play that role to a T like Freeman did.<br/><br/>
This movie is a lot more than just a series of gags. There is a well written story behind the gags and it keeps you interested. But the gags in this movie are EXTREMELY FUNNY, especially for a PG-13 movie. The part with the monkey almost had me falling out of my seat in laughter.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend ""Bruce Almighty."" They even threw an ""Ace Ventura"" joke in there that, surprisingly, only a few people in the theater I was in caught. This is a fun comedy to see if you're in need of a good laugh.

Jim Carrey is an amazing actor though, so I gave it a shot.<br/><br/>I am very glad I did.  Carrey does a wonderful job and an overlooked performance by the Daily Show's Stephen Colbert.  It's cliche, but this movie will make you laugh and could make you cry.  The film even turns out to be a great date movie due to the fairly strong realtionship issues in the plot. <br/><br/>For the religious people who want to boycott the movie.  Your missing out on one of the best mainstream films about faith and God in a long time.  The writers really knew their stuff and there are some humorous little bible references thrown in there.  In the end, the religious concept made me feel stronger about my faith as opposed to thinking ""Wouldn't it be cool to be God?""<br/><br/>That being said, this movie is PG-13 for a reason.  Its not a movie to take the kids too.  I think they used their max on the f word before a movie becomes R and there is some strong sexual references in the show.  For the mature audience though, this is a great flick to see with a group of guys, a mixed group, or just an intimate night with your date.  Not too intimate though as the movie theaters will probably be packed with people wanting to see this movie.  I give it 7 out of 10 on IMDB's scale."

","(minor spoilers)<br/><br/>After wasting away in dramas and family comedies, Jim Carrey has returned to the form that made him a star in Ace Ventura.

His physical and vocal humor as the best it has been in years and it is great to see he hasn't lost it yet.<br/><br/>Carrey gets some help from an unlikely comedic partner in Morgan Freeman, who hasn't been in many comedies (in fact, this may only be his second). But Freeman plays both serious and funny, and makes God both believable and watchable (he even throws in an ""Alrighty then"").  Jennifer Aniston is wasted, but then again, she has never been more than just a pretty face reading lines, even on Friends (and I like Friends).

","I'm not a Jim Carrey fan but in ""Bruce Almighty"" he hits all the right buttons and I both laughed and cared about him.  Carrey as God? Yup!<br/><br/>Bruce is a Buffalo, NY, TV reporter stuck with all the funny human interest stories while he yearns to be an anchor.  He lives with Grace Connelly, the lovely Jennifer Aniston, (wonder why IMDb gives only Grace's first name in the cast list while providing Bruce's last name, Nolan). The couple have a somewhat un-housetrained but adorable pooch, Sam.  Ms. Aniston really brings her role to life. So does Sam.<br/><br/>Bruce encounters God (the real McCoy) played by an impish Morgan Freeman. Now this God isn't your fire-breathing Jehovah nor is he a sad-with-his-creations's-follies Lord.  He's a Deity for Our Time, a well-dressed and soft-spoken fellow - decidedly non-denominational - who does a mean job with a mop on a big floor (he probably can do windows too but that wasn't in the film).  Yes, THIS God could pull me away from my agnosticism.  The only thing I expected Freeman to do that he didn't was roll out a fundraising scam.<br/><br/>This is a comedy with a nice dollop of romance.  And it works because the action is fast and the acting first-rate.  The story - God comes down to check things out - has been done many times but this is the first film where he transfers his power and authority to a mere mortal.

"JAKastner","8","0","1","23 May 2003"," The Moose Hole - Review of Bruce Almighty
","It is amazing knowing that Jim Carey has not had a new comedy, intended for the young adult crowd, in about three years. The man who was once declared a king of comedy seems to go through a bit of a dry spot in his career. Me, Myself & Irene was not the big hit everybody expected it to be especially from the directors of There's Something About Mary while his dramatic performance in The Majestic was critically hailed but the film itself was a big flop at the box office. Though he had his failures in the past four years, Carrey found success in the family hit, The Grinch. Now after some time off, Carrey returns to the comedy scene looking in top form. This time around he takes on the role of a man who thinks he can do a better job at being God then the big man himself. The question is, though, will this film do a better job then Carrey's previous misses or will his trend of failure continue?<br/><br/>The story goes that a man named Bruce Nolan is miserable and unhappy with his life. Granted, yes, he does look to have a pretty average life with a beautiful girlfriend, a good apartment and a steady job but he is going nowhere in his life. As a human interest story reporter, Bruce is passed on promotion after promotion which are given to people that flaunt it in his face. And whenever he tries to do something nice for somebody, like helping a homeless man on the street, bad things happen because of it. Continuous bad luck drives Bruce to the breaking point and he calls upon God himself. He shouts that God is not doing his job and claims he could do a better. Hearing his shouts, he gives Bruce the opportunity almost anybody would love to have: To be God and have all his powers. There are just two rules that come with this power: First, Bruce can't tell anybody he is God, and second, he can't affect a person's free will. Will Bruce help the poor and unfortunate? Sure, after he straightens his life out first, which could take awhile. The story of Bruce Almighty is pretty good though it is not completely perfect. The film does tend to slow down quite a bit in parts of the film which can be a problem for the overall effect.<br/><br/>
The cast of Bruce Almighty is pretty good for the most part. Jim Carrey is once again in top form as the lead character in the film. Carrey's dramatic emotions like he used in films like The Majestic actually come into use in parts of the film when serious issues are dealt with. The fact that Carrey can be so fun and then change unnoticeably into a serious state makes him an outstanding actor that is rarely seen in comedy today. Morgan Freeman is the perfect fit as God. Freeman, who has appeared in such dramatic films as Deep Impact and The Sum of All Fears, has rarely been seen in a comedy especially with the likes of Jim Carrey but he pulls the role off perfectly. Freeman's comic timing is so perfect that you wouldn't believe that he hasn't performed in many comedies. Hopefully the film's success will give him more reason to test the genre. The only real problem with the cast would be Jennifer Aniston. Granted she does look pretty in the film and presents some emotion in the film, she really does show any exceptional acting talent. For most of the film either she is crying or showing no emotion what-so-ever. She really doesn't present something to the character that the audience hasn't seen before or different from her character on Friends. Perhaps she should just stick with roles like The Good Girl, which was a critical success for her, because her comedic acting is not anything to laugh at.<br/><br/>Overall, Bruce Almighty is another good comedic popcorn flick but nothing extraordinary. There are too many small problems that plague the film to give it huge approval. The story is good but like it was said earlier, it is not spectacular. There are many funny elements within the course of the film but the story strays into too many moments where it just falls flat while the audience waits for the next hilarious moment to appear. While talking on the subject of jokes, when is Carrey going to get off the fart and potty humor to get laughs. There are a lot of moments where he uses witty lines and such to make the audience laugh but then later in the film strays into making fart noises interrupting a news anchor. Another problem with the plot of the film is that when it does go to the serious moments, it becomes way too sappy and pushes away a lot of the audience that just came for the comedy. If you have seen any romantic comedy before this film, you basically know how it ends. Most of the film is too predictable which sort of hurts it. Not to say the film is not funny. Jim Carrey saves the day for most of the film while Morgan Freeman helps with his rarely seen comedic whit. Bruce Almighty doesn't even come close to The Matrix Reloaded but does give some laughs for those too young to see the big hit sequel.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B)"

","Wow--- a really great movie! As a concept, ""Bruce Alimighty"" could have gone in a number of directions--- a few good, many bad. But the course the movie takes is charming, winsome, wholesome, and remarkably reverent. It is hilarious, but also was ""about"" something. I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie was about redemption, and self-empowerment. Love themes, and consciousness expanding themes, are usually met with derision and scorn by some lifeless, ego-tripping critics who consider themselves tragically hip, and somehow ""Cooler Than Thou."" Not surprisingly, there have been a few negative reviews by these members of the self-conscious Undead. However, many excellent critics have praised the movie, and I totally agree. It is life-affirming, funny, heart-warming. Thoroughly bright and entertaining.<br/><br/>Jennifer Anniston is such a great actor! Who knew her TV gig would evolve her into a real person with amazing grace, wit, and heart? Yaay Jennifer! And Jim Carrey is equally amazing here, as is the always magnificent Morgan Freeman. Go see it with a loved one, or someone you hope will become a loved one. You'll be uplifted and very, very glad you went! ""Bruce Almighty"" is a total 10 out of 10!"

","Bruce Almighty  was uneven, but mostly fun.  It seemed to be trying too hard. Some of it was predictably Jim Carrey slapstick stuff, which just didn't feel didn't feel spontaneous. The movie spent alot of time trying to show Bruce as a totally narcissistic character who blames God for EVERYTHING (even mistakes of his own making) and yet it was trying to keep us feeling that Bruce isn't  --really --  a bad guy, just a completely self-centered goofball. <br/><br/>Trying too hard is the main feeling of this movie. Yet I did come out smiling.   Morgan Freeman (as God) was marvelous.  I really liked Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's love-interest; she was a realistic character and we got to know and like her. The movie had a number of unexpected turns and was overall worth seeing.  Even more worth seeing if you wait and see it ""at the $1.50 theater""."

","What would you do if you had the powers of God? This is the question that drives the new comedy `Bruce Almighty', a new comedy that sees a likeable guy named Bruce (Jim Carrey), endowed with the powers of god after his complaining gets so severe that God himself, (Morgan Freeman), tasks Bruce do see if he could do a better job in the same role.<br/><br/>At first Bruce is skeptical, but eventually comes to love his new powers and uses them in a series of hysterical events that range from seducing his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Anniston), to taking revenge on a backstabbing co-worker at his job as a television reporter. Bruce also uses his powers to push his career, as he develops a reputation as Mr. Exclusive thanks to his divine ability to be on the spot for all manner of spectacular events that oddly seem to happen when Bruce is covering his usual human-interest stories.<br/><br/>Naturally things are all not fun and games, as Bruce comes to learn that with great powers comes great responsibilities, and is reminded by God that he has yet to use his powers to help anyone other than himself after his first week on the job. Bruce sets about answering prayers but is so overwhelmed by them, that he starts to rubber-stamp prayers with a yes response via his computer. Thinking he is helping Bruce is shocked when he sees the results as thousands of people win the lottery at once and riot when they learn that they only receive a meager $17.00 due to so many winners. Bruce is forced to learn that his actions no matter how well meaning can have unforeseen negative reactions.<br/><br/>The film did a good job at keeping things light and funny without having a heavy- handed segment where Bruce is forced to learn that sometimes despite great powers, tragic and bad things can happen. Instead the film concentrates on the laughs, and there are many, as well as subtly inserts some nuggets of wisdom pertaining to God, happiness, and life. Carrey is fantastic in the role and is a true delight to watch. It was nice to see him back in a larger than life comedy role after some good dramatic turns as despite all of his talent, his is still one of the most gifted comedians on film today and his absence from comedies was missed. Anniston does a nice job in the role of Grace as though it is not a deep role she plays the part with a natural charm and sweetness that adds to what would otherwise have been a throw away part.<br/><br/>The film is a very funny and enjoyable film and I was very happy and surprised to see that many of the best laughs and segments were not contained in the trailers. `Bruce Almighty' will make you laugh and you will leave the theater with a smile. Good job all around and welcome back to your roots Jim, you have been sorely missed.<br/><br/> 4 stars out of 5"

","A very timely production in an age when people are asking themselves about God and his ways.  More than fun, this movie has meaning and addresses questions like:  ""Could you do it better?""  ""What are your desires, really?"" ""What is best for you, really?""  Really ultimate questions in a very palatable and entertaining format.  Loved Jim Carey's style - just the right blend of spontaneous humor and serious thought."
"Piedreau","Null","0","1","15 May 2003"," Humor Has No Boundaries!
","I just saw a screening of this movie and i must say, i laughed almost the entire time. This is not your typical comedy with worn down jokes and misunderstandings that are supposed to be funny. This is a movie that shows the most controversial subject in the world can be a source of good fun. Religion and God are portrayed in a way so ridiculous and funny but also refreshing. Not the paved ways of making a joke but new and fresh angles are brought in to make us laugh. This comedy does what it is supposed to do: make me laugh until i get cramps!<br/><br/>Using Jim Carrey might on forehand be seen as a safe cast; use the guy with the rubber face the audience loves and the revenues will be good. Yet Carrey doesn't fall into the stereotype jokes and faces we are used to seeing from him, the expression on his face and the acting really know to surprise us.<br/><br/>I'd like to thank the people who made this film: it has been a long long time since i had such a laugh!"
"MyOpinionIsFact","7","0","1","19 December 2003"," Interesting watch
","This movie starts off bad. I'd say it was well-below average for the first quarter. By mid-way through, it was growing on me and by the end I was really caught up in it (to the point of almost tearing up in one scene!).<br/><br/>I will say this: watch the DVD extras! Some of them are extremely funny. I laughed harder at them than during the movie. There are also some good scenes that didn't make the final cut (because they didn't fit in with the rest of the movie but work by themselves). Take for instance the report where Carrey is dressed-up as Mark Twain -- I was rolling."

","At first I was waiting to watch a funny movie that was what I thought at the time going to make me angry.  I thought this was another movie to poke fun at religion in the world.  Ahhh but it was not.  This movie does have a meaning and it is a good one after all.  If you were afraid this movie would be ""bad"" you were wrong.  Yes there are moments that are classic Jim Carrey and you will laugh histerically but it is a movie with a point.  If you have not watched this yet go check it out.  It's okay you will be fine.  Watch this movie it is a feel good story with a good message."
