","""Not only is Singer's film-making aesthetically frustrating (lacking coherent visual rhythm) but his juvenile regard of the July 20, 1944, plot to kill Hitler -- one of 15 documented attempts -- is intellectually insulting..."" New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.<br/><br/>I'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.<br/><br/>VALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...<br/><br/>What makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.<br/><br/>It is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.<br/><br/>If the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that ""I was on the edge of my seat"" throughout the second half of the film.<br/><br/>So if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here."

","I have so much fun reading some ""critics"". Some want historical accuracy. Well this isn't a documentary. There's plenty of those around on this historical period. Some want German accents. The splendid ensemble cast are creating characters not demonstrating a sociolinguistics class. And others, the most unethical lot of all, criticise Cruise because of his personal identity rather than his acting chops.<br/><br/>Well, this extraordinary movie exacts sweet revenge on such misguided critics. It is a master class of the Kurosawa ""doctrine"" that because film is such a multimodal medium one needs to be careful to balance all the competing elements harmoniously.<br/><br/>The editing is so tight here that narrative, dramatic and characterisation elements cohere brilliantly into an organic and most satisfying whole.<br/><br/>I could talk about the ensemble cast a lot. Suffice it to say that that too is another most cohesive and targeted aspect of the film.<br/><br/>But this is Cruise's moment. He absolutely fills the screen with charisma. His acting is impeccable. ( He single handedly saved Eyes Wide Shut, such a great faux pas from such a great master as Kubrick). He is stellar, he shines, he smoulders, he is just scintillating.<br/><br/>Damn those who put him down because they don't approve of Scientology or his lifestyle. Those issues are completely irrelevant as criteria for judging a cinematic performance. His acting chops are so off the scale virtually in every single movie he's made, the whole Academy and related awards caper comes across as a village fair for amateurs.<br/><br/>Spectacular movie overall, the sort you come back to watch time and again."
"marcosaguado","8","321","393","9 January 2009"," The Failed Plot Against Tom Cruise
","I'm appalled at the way the specialized and not so specialized media attacked Tom Cruise for this movie. Why? He's not just good but very good in his against type performance. I've heard critics calling him ""distractingly bad"", how ridiculous and nasty. The film by the great craftsman Bryan Singer is a suspenseful, beautifully made historical thriller with a remarkable attention to detail. In an effort to be accurate the Jews are never mention because in fact the attempt to assassinate Hitler had nothing to do with that. The real reason? The war had turned against the Germans, it was clear that they were entering a down spiral and Hitler's madness was at the center of that. Regardless of the fact we know how the story ends, the movie manages to be a gripping tale based on real events. Well done Mr.Cruise, you won! Your Valkyrie is performing stupendously at the almighty box office."
"Prashast_Singh","10","12","12","25 November 2018"," One of the most fast-paced, strongly edited movies of all time!
","The best thing about VALKYRIE more than anything else is its pace. It's rare to find any movie with such an incredible fast pace in these days, let past days alone. Even thrillers these days venture more into drama and the suspense factor takes a backseat.<br/><br/>This isn't the case with VALKYRIE.<br/><br/>The reason? It's packaged more as a thriller than a drama and that's why the suspense remains watertight and the plot, breathtaking. Most historical films stretch beyond 2 and a half hours, while VALKYRIE stays to the point without any subplots or unnecessary drama to hinder the pace.<br/><br/>I didn't realize how quickly time flew by. Brian Singer did an effective job at pulling off a historical thriller. Tom Cruise shines in a dramatic role which has been written very well. Rest of the cast also makes a mark, and does exactly what is needed in this plot-based film.<br/><br/>VALKYRIE is dominated by a strong, tension-filled plot which remains suspenseful even till the end. No matter whether you're already aware of the facts, the film will keep you glued to the end.<br/><br/>There are a few action bits which have been executed very well, especially the one in the beginning. A few more of such sequences could've been added but the balancing is so proper that nothing really feels less or more.<br/><br/>I'd strongly recommend VALKYRIE to those who enjoy historical thrillers or just simply thrillers. And I need not to say that it's a must watch for Tom Cruise fans, as I've myself watched it for the same reason."
"bob the moo","Null","28","31","24 May 2011"," Solidly engaging thriller that works despite knowing the outcome before you start
","I'm not really a fan of Tom Cruise so I let this film go past me until it came to TV because I just thought it screamed ""star vehicle"" too loudly. In reality I was probably a bit too hasty with that call because Valkyrie is a solid little film that delivers an interesting story with the predictable Hollywood liberty but does so in a rather satisfying manner. Having decided to put my personal feelings on Cruise to one side, I did still think that the film would struggle because ultimately I already knew the ending (spoiler: the plot to assassinate Hitler isn't successful) and it would therefore not be able to hook me in. I think in a way this was correct but not really in the way that I thought.<br/><br/>In terms of just straight up narrative flow the film does engage; OK it maybe takes a while to establish the main players and get things moving forward but ultimately, while I knew they would fail, I was interested to see what happens, how it happens and what they did. On this level I enjoyed the film and although it was a full two hours long I wasn't bored by it and it felt like it was as long as it should have been. Where I thought it didn't quite pull it off is in the portrayal of why the conspirators felt they had to act. In this regard I didn't feel their desperation and I didn't get a tangible sense of how bad things were at this point in the war for Germany; I know from other films etc how bad things were but this film didn't really do that so much as simply say that things were bad. Likewise I didn't get a feel for the emotions behind the plot and instead I got the impression that the film was taking it as read that everyone dislikes Hitler and therefore that would be all the understanding we would need – this is perhaps partly true but the film needed this as part of it, not an external thing brought by modern audiences.<br/><br/>Singer does a really good job in terms of direction. There isn't a huge amount of action here but the tension is good and it is very well delivered to be a lot more effective than I thought it would be (again, the issue over knowing the ending). The cast is deep in quality but, like me, many will get stuck at Cruise. He does an OK job by which I mean he doesn't overplay or make it all about him the personality. The downside of this is that he doesn't bring much character out either and I didn't see much of a person in his character – he does have presence though, which helps a lot. The supporting cast is rich and their presence also helps the film since you cannot turn left or right without bumping into a quality British actor. Branagh, Nighy, Wilkinson, Stamp, Izzard, Hollander and so on – they all do solid work and are a boon to the film.<br/><br/>Valkyrie isn't a classic by any means but nor is it the ego-driven Cruise film I expected. Instead it is a solidly entertaining thriller based on fact that manages to engage even though you know the outcome. Cruise doesn't get in the way and the support cast make it stronger by their quality and their number."
"petsteph1","8","717","927","25 December 2008"," Great movie and thank god for IMDb!
","First, I want to say that some time ago I learned to distrust critics and instead read the reviews here on IMDb. I've never been misled, even when an equal number of viewers liked and disliked the same movie because that let me know there was a matter of taste in play, and that's fine. Sometimes a movie pleases everyone, but that's so rare I cant really think of one. People have different tastes and that's good. But the value of IMDb reviews is that they are based on a genuine response to the movie - not a bias, or some other agenda.<br/><br/>For example, the Fox critic Roger Friedman listed this movie as one of the worst of 2008 - without having seen the movie. That's right. He rated it without seeing it. It was a classic and reprehensible case of bias and perhaps even bigotry since he was engaging in Tom Cruise bashing which is usually practiced in conjunction with dissing Tom's religion.<br/><br/>So I don't trust critics to tell the truth or give an unbiased review.<br/><br/>I saw Valkyrie and enjoyed it immensely. I've studied the Hitler period and was familiar with most of the events but the movie educated me while it thrilled and entertained me. It is a movie I was happy to take my teen-aged children to see because it also educated and entertained them. I thought the cast did a great job. The script was outstanding and the direction excellent. Tom Cruise gave a dimension to Von Stauffenberg that deepened my understanding of the events. The supporting cast were brilliant. <br/><br/>I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>PS. It's some time since I wrote this review and I took thirty minutes tonight to read the other reviews on this movie, not surprisingly they are mostly very positive and unanimous in praising it. Interestingly, the critics, including the one named above, who trashed the movie without even seeing it, obviously did so in an effort to kill it at the box office. While many other reviewers noted this too, I'd like to point out that those critics and possibly some of the people who 'dont like Tom Cruise because of his weird religion' are actually following the same path that made it possible for Hitler to kill off millions of Jews who also had a 'weird religion'. Considering the historical background of Valkyrie I find that quite ironical."
"pragers","10","396","513","27 December 2008"," Excellent, historic thriller
","""Valkyrie"" takes on an important event in the history of Nazi Germany: the failed assassination attempt of German officers of the Wehrmacht against Hitler in 1944. Most Germans like myself are quite familiar with the story of the ""Stauffenberg-Attentat"" since it was not only the topic of many German docudramas (e.g. one made by well-known director Pabst in 1955) but is also widely discussed in history class in school. <br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised about the ""American"" interpretation in Valkyrie and think that Singer and Cruise came up with an excellent film. Although the outcome is known and the movie develops rather slowly in the beginning, it manages to create a highly suspenseful and darkish-intense atmosphere that keeps you captivated until the end. Complains regarding the American/English accents and the German actors not speaking with German accents, or criticizing that Stauffenberg was ""in reality"" more charming and not as stiff as Cruise' interpretation, are niggling and banal at best. The movie does not focus on the private, psychological side of Stauffenberg but on his leading role in the assassination plot planned and executed amidst the ""heart of darkness"", which -we can be sure- was more than nerve-wracking and left certainly little space for charm and jokes. BTW: I was glad to see Nina von Stauffenberg portrayed as the knowing and smart wife that she actually was. The performance of all actors is superb, and Cruise certainly deserves special praise since his commitment to the role is tangible and remarkably intense.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"
"rahprods-1","10","449","602","27 December 2008"," Most entertaining.
","Ignore the silly comments of some critics who want this movie to fail.  Schickel, Ebert and the L.A. Times got it right. If you're a World War  II history buff like me, you'll appreciate the fine effort that is  Valkyrie. It shows that American filmmakers as unlikely as Tom Cruise  and Bryan Singer can compete with the likes of the Downfall creators in  handling such subject matter. Like World War II itself, the full story  of the July 20 plot is long and intricate and cannot be fully told in  the confines of a two hour feature film. There are certainly many  peripherals to the story - its tentacles ran deep into the Nazi  diaspora; thousands were executed or ""disappeared"" (including Irwin  Rommel who was not portrayed in the film) - to say nothing of the mixed  motives in those Germans wishing to see Hitler dead. These are all  subjects that have already been explored and no doubt will be again in  the future. Suffice to say, Singer and editor/composer John Ottman  focused on the heart of this story: Hitler was destroying  Germany/Europe and the July 20 plotters bucked the odds to stop him.  The performances from this exceptional cast are first rate. Think what  you want about Tom Cruise and Scientology - I'm no big fan of either -  but judge the work on its merits. Cruise may not win an Oscar for his  portrayal of von Stauffenberg, but he more than gets the job done. In  terms of scope, the locations, battle scenes, costumes/uniforms,  staging/settings, you can't ask for more in a WWII movie. There's  nothing fake, nothing phony to spoil the period experience and vfx are  seamless as they should be. If you're expecting a formula Hollywood  thriller a la Bourne or M.I., you may be disappointed, but as a serious  adult drama Valkyrie delivers the goods. It took some balls to make  this movie and UA has earned its kudos."
"J_Trex","8","188","247","27 December 2008"," Excellent Historical Drama
","It was curious timing to release this film on Christmas Day. As David Letterman quipped on last night's monologue: ""Nothing says Holidays like a good Nazi death plot"".<br/><br/>Release timing not withstanding, this is a very powerful movie and by all accounts comports with the historical record. There was little embellishment for dramatic effect here. Hitler murder conspiracy dramas are abundant in Hollywood, but this one actually happened and was nearly successful. The story is riveting, and even though the outcome was already known (at least to anyone who had a rudimentary knowledge of WWII), the excitement level was sustained by not really knowing the precise timing of events or, more importantly, who would be spared in the end.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was very good in the lead role as the chief conspirator (Col. von Stauffenberg). The rest of the cast was first rate, including Tom Wilkinson as Gen'l Fromm, a Nazi head honcho who was playing both sides of the fence, and many other notable actors, such as Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp, all excellent.<br/><br/>For fans of ""Downfall"", the German film documenting Hitler's final week in the bunker (one of the all time great WWII films and #75 on the IMDb top 250), there were two actors from that movie playing in this one. Thomas Kretschmann and Christian Berkel both were key figures in ""Downfall"" had supporting roles in this film. <br/><br/>For people with an interest in WWII or history in general, this is one film worth checking out."
"mib-29","7","177","233","13 April 2009"," Great movie, doesn't do history justice
","I was curious about this movie since it had caused so much controversy with Tom Cruise in the main role. Personally I think he was after all not a bad choice for this part and all in all I am very happy that there is an American movie that shows the different side of Germany and Germans in the Third Reich (there was a time when in every Hollywood Movie the villain were always Germans). But Americans, who in general don't really have much understanding of history, fail to realize that Hitler wasn't voted into power by the people. As a matter of fact, he only received 36,8 % of the votes in the election. Though this made his party the leading one, he could only gain power because the politicians of the other parties thought they could control him. Once Hitler was able to turn Germany into a dictatorship, it was extremely difficult to form any resistance. So much as cracking a joke about the Fuehrer was reason enough to be imprisoned, investigated and executed. Organizing a conspiracy meant risking not only your life, but the life of everyone even remotely associated with you. And you could never be sure who you could trust or who might be a spy or simply rat you out for personal gain. This is where this movie falls a little short, because it shows Stauffenberg and others simply talking freely about their plans and their convictions. Yes, I get that it is very difficult to portrait this conflict and the tremendous danger in a two hour movie, but I can't help it, I just feel that it doesn't give the audience a real picture of how daring this operation was and how nerve wracking this must have been (remember, this was the third attempt of Stauffenberg. He had the explosives with him two times before and had to abort ... each time risking detection). If you really think this through, you can not have enough respect for their courage. And I can't help but to point out, that most people don't even have the civil courage to demonstrate and protest in a free country with a democratic government.<br/><br/>Bottom line: great movie and you should watch it. Just be reminded, that this is a very watered down version of history."
"Reef-Shark","8","43","53","5 January 2009"," Ignore the Nagative Hype
","Forget all the negative hype surrounding Valkyrie, because I assure you it is false. Bryan Singer has made a well-crafted thriller that kept me and my family on the edge of our seats until the end  even though we all know what the story's unfortunate outcome. Also, many tabloids were making this out to be the movie that would permanently cripple the career of Tom Cruise. This is entirely false. Cruise delivers a fine performance, and this hatred I can only assume is related to his rather odd personal life. Tom Cruise is as strong of an actor as he ever was, and I won't let something like turning Oprah's couch into a playground deny the fact that the man has talent, and is a truly passionate actor (and seriously, he does have a slight resemblance to Stauffenberg).<br/><br/>The movie is based on the last of fifteen known attempts on the life of German dictator Adolf Hitler (I'm sure everyone will have him in a nice ""Five Most Evil People"" list), and has Tom Cruise playing Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who of course was the key player in the assassination attempt. Ultimately this attempt failed (as we all know Hitler would die by suicide nine months later), but that doesn't keep Valkyrie from being an addictively engaging film.<br/><br/>Every member of the cast does their part well, not jockeying for superiority in any way. More importantly Cruise does not grandstand in this movie, fading in with the rest of the cast, rather than trying to stand above them like you'd expect, given his past films. Cruise gives a performance similar to 2005's War of the Worlds, where he does a good performance, but he never tries to overpower the other members of the cast. In Valkyrie Tom Cruise is a being a good team player, not trying to steal any glory, and never once does he overact the part.<br/><br/>Using very little CGI Valkyrie is also a wonderful film to look at. The vintage automobiles and aircrafts make this film have a distinct authentic flair that few other war films have (CGI looks like it was only used for the climatic assassination attempt). You can look at this and tell that this is the real deal, with the production team putting careful care into how they want this film to look, unlike most Blockbuster films that try and inflate every aspect of the film rather than aim for reality. Like the performance by Tom Cruise they don't try and overpower the audience with special effects, they simply let the characters slip into the realistic settings.<br/><br/>Also, the complaints about the accents I truly feel are desperate attempts to bash Cruise's performance. It was director Bryan Singer's concept to not use false German accents, and not that of Cruise, or the primarily British cast. I agree with Singer's concept that if feels false, and inaccurate to have people speak in English, but with foreign accents. I know several Germans in real life, and they do not sound very ""German"" when they speak in English, because the accent is not intended for the English language. I personally feel the desire for English being spoken in German accents comes from decades of WWII films where we've categorized every-single member of the German army, and by them speaking in that accent only is to cliché them and separate them from American audiences. They can speak in German accents, but only if they're speaking in German, because if they aren't it seems to be a tool to keep your common American moviegoer from relating to the characters.<br/><br/>Don't go into Valkyrie expecting to be greeted with a horrifically bad film that you will be able to poke fun at with friends. The movie has been released, and I feel the rumors, and negative hype of been proved decisively false. This isn't a movie to kill Cruise's career, but it won't help him regain love in the American community either (as previously mentioned he doesn't shine so much as mix in with the rest of the cast). It is a very enjoyable dramatization of a true event, and I don't think the material could have been handled much better, even with a full German cast, because Singer's style and method of conveying this story are all very well-done.<br/><br/>Go out and enjoy this dramatization of one of the darkest periods of human history. It is worth every second of your time, and all though it isn't Oscar-worthy it is certainly worth two-hours of your time."

","Claus von Stauffenberg, a man famous for being a German Army Officer who came closest to a assassinating Adolf Hitler. Von Stauffenberg is the closest figure Germany has to a national hero during World War 2. It's surprising that it took so long for a film to be made, nor to be a German film.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is a test project for the newly reformed United Artists under Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner. It was also a smaller project for Bryan Singer after doing 3 superhero films and reunite Singer and Christoper McQuarrie for the first time after the Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>Valkyrie starts with a prelogue sequence in North Africa. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a disaffected officer who is questioning Hitler's regime and that he was leading Germany to the path of destruction. During a British air raid he is injured badly, loosing an eye, his right hand and two fingers on his left hand. He can no longer serve on the front line. In 1943 General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) fails in his attempt to assassin Hitler and the German Resistance loss an army officer to help with operations. Von Stauffenberg is recruited in the resistance and the General Staff. He comes up with the Valkyrie plan which was to make the assassination of Hitler look like an SS plot, and get the army to launch a coup to 'protect' the Nazi regime. Von Stauffenberg is the only man who could get close to Hitler because he was the Chief-of-Staff for the Reserve Army General. The film is split into three major parts, the planning, the assassination attempt and the attempted coup.<br/><br/>Singer was able to bring in a very stylist approach of direction. I enjoy Singer's films and he was able to show his skills again. He is able to get an excellent cast, including Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Terrence Stamp and Tom Wilkingson to name a few. However, he shot the film in the style of a thriller, which was interesting, but being a historical film with most people knowing the outcome already takes away the suspense. But Singer did make an enjoyable film. The film has a strong script<br/><br/>Valkyrie is a strong, enjoyable film. It is not Singer's best but he can still pull it of."
"michaelmalak","9","390","559","19 December 2008"," Must See Movie
","One of the best movies I've seen in years. In the world where special effects and cheesy plots make 99% of all films, ""Valkyrie"" delivers psychological thriller with a lesson in history. I saw this movie with my 9 year old son who is a big Military Fan. In the eyes of a 9 year old boy - the World consists of ""Good Guys"" and ""Bad Guys"". I hope that this movie will allow him to recognize that the World is little more complex than ""Black & White"" or ""Good & Bad"". This movie is the first film I have ever seen that presents German People as human beings trapped in the wheels of a spinning war machine, and not merely monsters responsible for all WWII atrocities. The movie illustrates political ties and relationships between Army and SS which were at the heart of Hitler's grip on the Reich."
"TxMike","Null","7","7","27 May 2009"," Very fine account of one of the many Hitler assassination attempts.
","Quite by coincidence I watched two Nazi-related movies on successive nights, first ""The Reader"" and now this one, ""Valkyrie."" Both different, both excellent.<br/><br/>As we have been able to reflect on the aftermath of WW II (I was born right after it ended) it is clear that Hitler had many enemies in his own country. As far back as 1938 and continuing through the mid-1940s there were a number of attempts to assassinate him, by his own soldiers. As history tells us they all failed, but mercifully Hitler took his own life at the end of the war.<br/><br/>""Valkyrie"" is a Wagner composition, but also a code word for a military contingency plan in Nazi Germany. Tom Cruise is Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, seriously wounded in 1943 in North Africa fighting, and now viewed as a military hero back in Germany. He is one of many who realize that Hitler is misguided and worry that if they don't do something to stop him it will result in the end of Germany and Europe as they knew it, as the Allies were getting closer to victory.<br/><br/>This movie contains a good number of established stars in key roles, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Thomas Kretschmann, Terence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard.<br/><br/>The story recounts, with suitable historical accuracy, one of the attempts on Hitler's life, with Von Stauffenberg as the key driver of the effort. It is an absorbing glimpse into 1940s Nazi Germany and the different factions, those with absolute loyalty to Hitler and those seeking ways to oust him.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Of course the assassination attempt chronicled here failed, the small bomb went off and Stauffenberg escaped the encampment, but the heavy map table shielded Hitler well enough that he survived the blast with only relatively minor injuries. Thinking Hitler was indeed dead the rebels initiated the revised Valkyrie plan to usurp power, but were fairly quickly arrested, tried, and executed."
"alexkolokotronis","8","99","139","31 December 2008"," The Supporting Cast Leads The Way
","I really enjoyed this movie and I maybe one of the few that was not annoyed by Tom Cruise. Well as I'm sure most people know this movie is about the failed assassination attempt of Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>The acting was very good throughout. I actually enjoyed Tom Cruise's performance but he did not take the lead as strongly as he should have. He did what had to be done but he could have elevated this movie like he has done to others in the past. His role needed that maverick type attitude like he provided in Born On the Fourth of July. His non-German accent was not an issue it was the strength that he displayed in his performance that was disappointing to many. This movie was certainly a chance for him to build his career back up to a more serious level but he clearly did not impress too many people with his role as Stauffenburg to do that. Still, he was enjoyable to watch for me.<br/><br/>The supporting cast though was great. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson were all pivotal in the success of this movie and they certainly filled in perfectly. All around they were great performances but who I especially liked was Christian Berkel who I haven't heard of before as well as Jamie Parker.<br/><br/>The directing of Bryan Singer was superb. He provided an amazing amount of suspense to a movie that everyone knew the ending to. For a good half hour I was totally frozen watching as the plot unfold. I also thought the movie was paced very well and he brought the best out of the supporting cast. Of course it was shot very well with a great production throughout. The movie was written very nicely but as many people have said, it would have been great if there was more emotional depth added to the characters to make the audience feel more attached them.<br/><br/>This movie certainly had a lot of potential but it stayed within the realm of mostly a suspense action movie. Valkryie reminded me of a WW2 movie from the 50s and 60s with its style and pacing. It's very interesting to think about what ifs' and its kind of funny to think they almost pulled off the impossible without killing Hitler. Valkryie perfectly illustrates how the smallest of things can have the biggest impact."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","52","71","22 March 2009"," Good movie, strange accents
","Valkryie, a movie that takes on the closest assassination to Adolf Hitler, being such a huge history buff, sadly I knew how this was going to end. I love walking out of the theater hearing the teenagers go ""What the heck?! I thought Hitler was going to die!"", I bow my head in shame. I know that there were a lot of people who had a thing about Tom Cruise being the leading man, which I have to admit I had a few questions, but you cannot deny despite his madness, he is a good actor over all. I admit he can be cocky, but he got the film done with pretty decent taste. I just have to laugh though because in this film we have every kind of accent there is: American, English, German, EVEN POLISH! A Polish Nazi? LOL, I'm sure that history must be proud of this movie. But over all it's a decent representation of the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>During World War II, Wehrmacht Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is severely wounded in Tunisia, and is evacuated home to Nazi Germany. Meanwhile, Major General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler by smuggling a bomb aboard the Führer's private airplane. The bomb, however, fails to detonate and Tresckow safely retrieves it to conceal his intentions. After learning that the Gestapo has arrested General Hans Oster, he orders General Olbricht to find a replacement. After recruiting von Stauffenberg into the German Resistance, Olbricht delivers von Stauffenberg to a meeting of the secret committee which has coordinated previous attempts on Hitler's life. The members include General Ludwig Beck, Dr. Carl Goerdeler , and Erwin von Witzleben. The Colonel is stunned to learn that no plans exist for after Hitler's assassination. After a bombing raid on Berlin, he lights upon using the plan Operation Valkyrie, which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army to maintain order in the event of a national emergency. The plotters carefully redraft the plan so that they can dismantle the Nazi regime after assassinating Hitler, by overthrowing the SS and imprisoning Hitler's closest advisors. Realizing that only General Fromm, the head of the Reserve Army, can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht in a Post-Nazi Germany and recruit him into the fold: however, Fromm initially refuses. With the rewritten plan needing to be signed off by Hitler himself, von Stauffenberg visits the Führer at his Berghof estate in Bavaria. In the presence of his inner circle, Hitler praises von Stauffenberg's heroism in North Africa not realizing the Colonel's true intentions.<br/><br/>Besides the accents and the A-list actors, honestly this could've been a made for TV film. It's not exactly the hit I think the studio was hoping for. Normally most WWII films are a big hit, but the problem was the advertising, the trailer I felt was a bit inappropriate, and the actors, I felt that this if not made in German should have just been with English actors or all American because all the accents were throwing me off. But the film is definitely worth the watch, I just suggest if you are ignorant when it comes to history, please for the love of God, do some research before watching a film like this, not just because Tom Cruise is in it.<br/><br/>7/10"

","This story is based on real incidents happened in Germany in 1944 during the Hitler regime of World War II. German Colonel Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) gets injured in a war at South Africa. He loses one eye, one palm and two fingers on the other hand. Stauffenberg feels that Hitler is doing more harm to Germany than any help. There is a group of officers who feel the same. He joins them and conspires and executes a plot to assassinate Hitler using Operation Valkyrie which holds key to the usage of reserved army in crisis.<br/><br/>WE KNOW THE CLIMAX: All of us knew that Hitler final end came through the act of suicide. Hence we knew in advance that he was not assassinated. And the entire movie runs on an attempt to assassinate Hitler. It requires tremendous narrative from the director if the audiences already knew the climax. Bryan Singer who directed the most fascinating 'The Usual Suspects' comes up with another riveting thriller drama in the form of 'Valkyrie'.<br/><br/>It is more fascinating because a part of German Army believes that Germany's reputation is going down because of Hitler. This film shows the humanistic soldiers who are under director command of Hitler. I loved the way Hitler is shown. The entire film is shot from the point of view of Stauffenberg. Hence Hitler is shown for a few seconds in the entire movie  that's too in flashes without revealing the entire body.<br/><br/>TAILPIECE: Valkyrie is a tautly made psychological thriller with interesting background and is based on real incidents involving Hitler's final months. This film has linear narration with no confusion."

","Talk about a difficult subject matter to capture on film, 'Valkyrie' was it.<br/><br/>Not only was the subject culturally sensitive it was no doubt time sensitive (dated) as well. Generations ' X and Y' are probably not well acquainted with what was at stake back then. Maybe many 'baby-boomers' also lack insight about the turmoil that existed inside National Socialist Nazi Germany in 1944.<br/><br/>Those of us who are better versed in world history though are not perplexed by the events 'inside' Nazi Germany. Moreover, we know now what a successful coup would have meant. Possibly the duration of WW II, well, the European 'theater' part could have been shortened had Hitler's would-be assassins succeeded.<br/><br/>And of course at the center of the maelstrom lay Colonel Klaus von Stauffenberg. His role as portrayed by Tom Cruise in the plot to kill the Nazi Supreme Commander was nothing short of supreme bravado even in failure. Cruise, to my surprise delivered a credible account of the German loyal to the Republic but not to Hitler. <br/><br/>Moreover, the Wehrmacht's swearing of an oath of total allegiance to Hitler was all a mistake. Those who swore did on the basis of cleverly concocted lies. Colonel von Stauffenberg states as much many times.<br/><br/>Despite the advance billing of an 'all-star' supporting cast, none of them were needed. Even including Kenneth Branagh and Terrence Stamp as key conspirators, did not alter the cold, bare facts. The film was all about Cruise, er, Col. von Stauffenberg. <br/><br/>A German looking Tommie handled the center stage heat and stress well. By extension an argument can be made here that this was actor Cruise's signature performance on film. That's how I saw him.<br/><br/>Fancy that: the avowed Hitler hater finds redemption in failure. Don't believe me? Ask Tom. The main actor expressed his loathing of Hitler in an interview during filming.<br/><br/>As an adjunct, the director tried his hand at political subterfuge on at least one occasion. If I recall correctly, Hitler's character poses a vexing thought. The camera pans closer. A polished lens soon finds the German leader's cold stare. Thereafter he lays down the gauntlet to Colonel Cruise.<br/><br/>For posterity's sake I'll repeat Hitler's words.<br/><br/>""If one understands this (Valkere), then one understands (German) National Socialism.""<br/><br/>Say again...<br/><br/>Sorry Tom, we're out of space. Ex-Chancellor Hitler got the last word. Better luck next time, (if there is one)."

","Tom Cruise is one of those actors who can't shake a youthful image. When one thinks of him, one thinks of All The Right Moves, Top Gun, even Taps as the young brat packer. Of all the young players of the Eighties labeled the Brat Pack, Cruise has had the most staying power by far. <br/><br/>In Valkyrie, Cruise holds his own with some classically trained players from across the pond like Terrence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, and Tom Wilkinson. These folks in varying degrees participate in the plot named Operation Valkyrie to assassinate Adolph Hitler and hopefully bring about a short conclusion of the war. <br/><br/>Working against them was the unconditional surrender policy agreed to by the Allies. Everyone well remembered Hitler's skillful use of the betrayal issue that came about in that interregnum between the Armistice and the Versailles Treaty. The Allies wanted Germany beaten with no doubt about it this time around.<br/><br/>And they would have had to have bagged a whole gang of them, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Bormann etc. for it to work. Nobody on the Allied side would have dealt with any of these specimens. In fact when they did break the policy and negotiate a surrender with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and due to circumstances to lengthy to go into here, the objective was not accomplished and we had a yard by yard war up the Italian peninsula instead of a quick surrender.<br/><br/>Cruise let's face it is not a brat packer any more. In fact he's roughly the age that Stauffenberg was when he became the point man for bombing on July 20, 1944. He even looks a bit like him. There's also a trace of the German aristocratic air about him that Stauffenberg was. Claus von Stauffenberg did come from an old Catholic aristocratic family with a military tradition who saw the Nazis as parvenus. But it was hard to argue with Hitler's early military success, especially for a military man.<br/><br/>The performance really to watch here is that of Tom Wilkinson who is a really oily individual as General Fromm who was trying so hard to keep himself in good with both sides so he could come out on top. As for what happened to him, watch a very worthwhile film to find out."

","This was a hauntingly suspenseful film. Though we all know the outcome of the events that took place, you still hold your breath as the events unfold. I haven't felt like this about a film since ""13 days"" never realizing (as I wasn't there) how close things really came! The whole cast was powerful, that being said I felt that it could have been a little longer. I wish the film spent more time with Tom's character so we could know a little bit more about him but with the screen time he had he made it clear that their were two sides. Those who wanted to over throw Hitler and where Men of action and those who just wanted to sit around talking about doing it. It is clear that Tom's character was driven by taking action, just wished we knew a little bit more about him.<br/><br/>After the film my friend and I were debating on what parts of the story were true or what was embellished. Im very certain the characters kids playing the record ""Flight of the Valkarie"" was completely fictionalized and even a bit out of place, or perhaps too obvious would be the best choice of words. However that was my only real complaint to the makers of the film. Other than that it was really well done and have a pretty good feeling that the story will stick with me for a long time. Cause lets face it, these conspirators REA-A-A-L-Y came close to pulling it off. I was actually surprised at how close they got to winning and over throwing Hitler. I could just recall something about the bomb going off and the table top was the only thing that saved him back when they were telling me about this in High school. Even then a bit of curiosity sparked in my mind but that was it.<br/><br/>This film really flushed everything out and shed some light and give a ""wider scope"" on the people of Germany and like the trailer said ""To show the world that we are not all like him"" Its definitely a film to be proud of."

","I just got back from the theatre moments ago, and felt compelled to write my first review on this website.<br/><br/>Let's just get this out of the way: Tom Cruise can still act. I don't care about his personal life, as that is his business and his business alone. His portrayal of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg is an honest one. I truly don't believe the critics when it comes to him. Sometimes, you need to discard what you know about the actor and see him only as his character. He lets the viewer do this, at least, it worked on me.<br/><br/>Also, I thought the beginning was exceptionally crafted. It set the perfect tone for the rest of the film, and I was pleased to hear a little German. It really helped authenticate the rest of what we were to see. And the transition from Cruise speaking German to English was well- done. I thought it was a great tool against those who would otherwise dismiss the rest of the movie because it was in English. I, however, couldn't care less, because I understand that were it to be done in subtitles, the film would lose over half its audience.<br/><br/>(spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Ultimately, I felt this film was very well-done. I spent about 15 minutes listening to my heart pound in my chest in suspense of what was to happen next. Even though I knew Hitler would live, I ached to learn how the other characters' stories would end. That is another wonderful thing about this movie: You really CARE about the individual characters. They're endearing and honestly-performed.<br/><br/>(spoilers done)<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie to everyone, Cruise fan or not."
"Theo Robertson","7","31","49","11 November 2012"," Manages To Keep The Suspense Going Even If It Is Hollywood History
","This is a very mixed bag of a film . Despite the numerous mentions of Tom Cruise spoiling the film this isn't the worst aspect and for the most part it's a very enjoyable Hollywood thriller and I emphasise the word thriller <br/><br/>It plays rather much like one of these classic film noir thrillers where a cop infiltrates the mob and you just know that his cover is going to get blown with very nasty consequences . In a film where the outcome is known it's difficult to keep suspense up but here director Bryan Singer and screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander keep the audiences on the edge of their seats . This starts relatively early in the film where General Von Tresckow gives away a case of brandy which disguises a bomb intended to kill Aldoph Hitler . When the bomb fails to explode he knows he will be linked to a failed assassination attempt so we're shown a series of scenes where retrieves the case not knowing if his plot has been discovered <br/><br/>And the film places emphasis on this type of consequence . All too often in documentaries this assassination attempt is mentioned but doesn't explain how the plotters managed to conceal the failed assassination attempt . Likewise when the July bomb plot is set up the film goes in to considerable detail what is to be down after Hitler is killed . It's not enough to kill Der Fuherer , all Nazi hierarchy and institutions must nuetralised . In effect it must be made to look like it was other elements of the Nazi party carried out the bombing on the Wolf's Liar and Von Stauffenberg and his colleagues want to cleanse Germany of the Nazi despots who are dragging Germany in to Armageddon . It's this aspect that works very well <br/><br/>Where the film fails at - and it is a very big failure - is the motives for doing so where the curse of Hollywood history strikes again. Everyone can agree that the "" good Germans "" wanted to be rid of Hitler and paid for this by their lives but as is often misinterpreted by history their motives weren't exactly the most noble . The conspirators knew Britain and America would never accept a negotiated peace deal with the Nazis in power and that the Soviet Union would never accept anything than the total annihilation of Germany Nazi or otherwise . When characters in the film mention making peace with the allies what they really mean is "" making peace with the Western democracies "" as in Britain and America leaving their toe holds in France and Italy and cessation of airlight bombing by the USAAF and night time bombing by the RAF so that Germany could continue its war in the East where millions upon millions of Slavs had died at the hands of the Germans . It should also be remembered of these millions a large proportion were by Germans who were not Nazis . The ordinary Wehrmacht could be just as brutal towards the inhabitants of Poland and the USSR as the Nazi death squads<br/><br/>At the end of the day brave men with the courage of their convictions paid the ultimate price for their courage . As VALKYRIE points out many of them didn't die a quick clean death either , being slowly strangled by piano wire is an unpleasant death and history should never forget these men who tried to kill history's most brutal tyrant . But at the same time history shouldn't forget the motives for doing so which aren't as black and white as the ones shown here"

This is beautiful to look at with a real sense of being in the Nazi world. And it is at times a taut film about a plot to kill the Fuhrer (I know you can all here the ""but"" coming, so I won't disappoint you) BUT the film has one large problem, we know how it turns out.Forgive me for saying that unless you really don't know your history you know the plan fails and everyone dies. Short of them rewriting history there is one and only one way this can go, and its not really a happy one. This doesn't mean there is no tension, there is, it just means there are no surprises except in the details. For me the films inability to transcend the fact we know it ends badly keeps it from being a being a great film and instead making it only a good one. Its is possible to make a great film about a failed event, one need only look at Khartoum or the Alamo to see two films that hold you in such away that you forget the ending. Don't get me wrong its a good film, I just wish they had made me forget the ending at the start.(Counter point recent films where I knew the ending and didn't care or forgot it in the flow: Milk, Che, Frost/Nixon)"

","I went to a pre-screening of Valkyrie and I was surprised to find myself enjoying the movie more than I thought I would.<br/><br/>The story is straight forward, detailing the last of 15 known assassination attempts against Adolf Hitler. Since history tells us Adolf Hitler committed suicide I went into the theater with a sense of frustration, and small disappointment knowing the villains would succeed, the heroes ultimately fail due to under estimation of their adversaries.<br/><br/>The plot is neither hindered nor helped by Tom Cruise. He plays his usual intense, glowering, stiff faced character, and is outshone by the supporting cast. You can almost forget that he's in the movie if you can appreciate the performances of Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Terence Stamp, and other actors who play the chief conspirators, including Eddie Izzard, and Christian Berkel.<br/><br/>I came out of the theater contemplating the course of history oddly enough, so yes the movie is thought provoking, but I don't think I would see it again because it is so straightforward, making it hard to glean extra insights into the characters and story. Thanks to the supporting cast the movie didn't tank, and the direction made the movie intense in many parts, even though you know what's gonna happen at the end.<br/><br/>Since I saw a prescreening the tickets were free, and I would say if you have a problem with Tom Cruise, that's the way you should see this movie, because it is worth watching. Or pay the money for a ticket, and just think about how you're supporting the career of actors who actually deserve it.<br/><br/>Go see the movie for it's values sake, and because it's a good film. Don't expect a lot of action, or blood. Expect a good story, and good acting by a majority of the cast."

","When I first saw the trailer for Valkyrie, I said to myself, ""plenty of potential, but it looks like it will be wasted."" I was offered a the chance to see the film a couple times but turned away since it didn't look too promising to me. But I finally succumbed and decided to give the film a shot and see how it would hold up. After quietly leaving the theater with my friend, I can say this was a very nice surprise; and I'd encourage anyone curious to see the film to do so.<br/><br/>One thing I said to myself before the film started was that I just couldn't see Tom Cruise pulling off an eye-patched Nazi attire. This was one of the first areas the film surprised me; Cruise managed to fit into his role as Colonel Stauffenberg very well. He also managed to make Stauffenberg one of his more likable characters for what I've seen. The supporting cast also do a good job and were arguably better at their roles than Cruise.<br/><br/>The film does get off to a rather slow start but it ultimately sets the scenario up for what becomes an interesting and very engaging watch. While the end result(s) aren't surprising it's still neat to see how everything plays out and this is ultimately the film's greatest strength. Once the climax and plot began to play out I could not look away from the screen.<br/><br/>Definitely check this film out if you get the chance, I can almost guarantee you'll leave the theater satisfied."
"ARTaylor","8","14","20","12 January 2009"," A Great Cast Drives This Excellent Thriller
","This is an enjoyable movie. It isn't quite as different as The Usual Suspects but it's still an intriguing film. The German channel ZDF summed it up well: Valkyrie is ""neither scandalously bad nor the event of the century...Neither is it the action thriller we feared, but it is a well-made and serious film."" <br/><br/>The story is suspenseful, filled with tension to keep you glued to it. It isn't bogged down with pointless side stories to add needless drama. ""Will he do it for the world or will he chicken out to be with his family?"" There's already enough going on with just trying to get it all planned out and get everyone on board. The movie's like the characters, know what needs to be done and just goes for it. And I liked that they didn't delve into every character's back story and reason for trying to kill Hitler. It's 2008/09. We know there's plenty of reasons for people to kill the man. Besides, that would have just added twenty to thirty minutes of dialog and exposition just to say that Hitler is bad.<br/><br/>This proved to be a great role for Tom Cruise. For once he doesn't just break out in a run for some random reason trying to be an action star. Here he goes back to what he's good at, like his older roles in A Few Good Men or Rain Man. He's a good actor but not when he's running around. Maybe we can finally forget about him on the couch and think of his acting.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast works perfectly. Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and the ever lovable Terence Stamp are all in top form. There doesn't seem to be a single person who could be replaced with someone better.<br/><br/>The production values are great, certainly nothing is done half-hearted. Everything looks amazing and is well done, the kind of touch Bryan Singer brings. I like all of Singer's movies. Usual Suspects, X-Men 1 & 2, and even Superman Returns. He's no Christopher Nolan or Steven Spielberg but he's still a fine director.<br/><br/>My only real problem with the movie is I wish there was some extra punch to it. This is a real historical account. Therefore we already know how it ends. Anyone who would see this movie should have enough education from grade school to know that this plot didn't kill Hitler. This is the problem that faced the Star Wars prequel trilogy. How to make it engaging when the audience knows the ending. He did a good job but I feel he could have gone further. Maybe Singer should have taken a page from Nolan's book and made it non-linear. Perhaps played up the suspense of Hitler trying to communicate before the plotters succeeded. Or something a little more that would have pushed it from a good movie to great one.<br/><br/>It's an exciting thriller that I recommend to everyone. It showcases not only an important event but one of the best parts of humanity. The plotters weren't saints but normal, average human beings trying to be good. They stood up in the midst of insurmountable odds to do what is right. And the fact that it was all true made it all the more touching.<br/><br/>And in the end it did what all movies should aspire to do: I left wanting to see it again."

","This is a fine movie about the July 20 plot of 1944 made with magnificent American-British-German actors and great production values. The picture contains a brief biographical remarks about Claus Schenk Graf Von Stauffenberg life(1907-1944), his wife(Van Hooten) and sons but focusing mainly the July Plot. The film packs a colorful cinematography by Newton Thomas Siegel and atmospheric musical score by John Ottman, also film-editor.This story about Stauffenberg and the famous event from how was orchestrated the dangerous plot has been well directed by Brian Singer(X men). Another versions about this fateful tale are: the classic version(1955) by G.W. Pabst with Bernhard Wicki as Stauffemberg, an American TV movie starred by Brad Davies and German adaptation titled 'Stauffemberg(2004)' with Sebastian Koch, Christopher Buchold and directed by Jo Baier who bears special remembrance to 'Valkyrie'.<br/><br/>Adding more details over the widely described on the movie, the deeds happened of the following manner: In the early part WWII Stauffenberg(Tom Cruise) served with distinction as an officer in a Bavarian cavalry regiment in Poland, France and North Africa where in 1943 he was deeply wounded. He was saved by the expert supervision of Dr. Ferdinand, Germany's most famous physician. Reporting back for service, he was appointed chief of staff of the Army Department. During his convalescence he revised his attitude . He made no secret of his utter contempt for Hitler(David Bamber) and Nazism. He resented any form of totalitarianism, especially National Socialism, and criticized Hitler as the Antichrist.The meticulous Stauffenberg then decided to join the conspirators against Hitler with the goal of liquidating the Nazi regime and replacing it with a new social state that would maintain the good name of fatherland. Always impelled by Christian morality and angered by the excesses of Nazism, Stauffenberg became the leader of the conspiracy. At the center of the plot were such senior officers as Gen. Von Tresckow(Kenneth Branagh), chief of staff in Army Group Center on the Russian front, Col.Gen Friedrich Olbricht(Bill Nighy), head of supply Section of the Reserve Army , Major Gen. Erwin Van Witzleber(David Scofield) and General Beck(Terence Stamp). Added to these senior members were a number of younger officers(Christian Berkel as Mertz) who believed who Third Reich was a catastrophe for Germany and were willing to gamble their lives on the outcome of the plot. Others knew of the plot but did not take an active role in it. Among them were Field Marshal Erwin Rommel,popular war hero, General Canaris and Field Marshal Hans Von Kluge, army group commander in France. In March 1943 General Tresckow decided that the time had come for action. A British-made bomb time , disguised as a bottle of brandy, was placed on the Fuehrer's plane , but the bomb failed to explode and it was never discovered. Then General Von Tresckow agreed with Stauffenberg that the assassination attempt must be made at all costs: 'We must prove to the world and to future generations that the men of the German Resistance movement dared to take the decisive step and wager their lives on it'. When Hitler called a conference of his close military advisers at the headquarter at Rastenburg, Staufffenberg arrived and in his briefcase along with papers and reports, was a British time bomb. He set the timer on the bomb and brought it into the conference room. After greeting the Fuehrer , he placed the briefcase on the floor beside Hitler and the excused himself: 'I must make a telephone call'. And the bomb exploded......"

","Indeed this mission was impossible. This movie is named after a Wagner composition. Wagner gave verve to the German spirit during WWII with its driving musical compositions. But this Valkyre tune is also the name of the operation of the defense forces which would help to replace the German Government after Hitler were to be killed by whomever. There was a plan to protect the integrity of the German Government should Hitler die for any reason. Van Stauffenberg attempted to control this operation already in place and to place himself in control of it when Hitler were to be killed.<br/><br/>This movie helps to cleanse Germany of its sins. It will be welcome there. Tom Cruise has shed any boyishness in his portrayal of the Col. Stauffenberg. Therefore, it all works. The movie moves along like a ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" with few slow moments. The tension builds and builds and you will not be immune to it. I believed everything. I saw no flaw that would be amusing. This is a serious movie, not entertainment.<br/><br/>I gave it an ""8"" because I felt it was not as creative as some other movies. But then this is because it sticks to the facts. It is a historical movie not a creative romp.<br/><br/>You will leave this movie with a serious demeanor, but there is still the saving grace that good triumphed over evil eventually. And if you are German you can choose to identify with the good guys now. Hitler is not made much of in this movie.<br/><br/>Everything flows from one event to another with smoothness and sometimes passion. Everything is explained well. I think everyone should see it once if just to remember that there were other types of Germans involved in WWII who did not walk the party line.<br/><br/>I feel it is one of the best movies of the year, perhaps in the top 15 of the year."
"gary-444","3","30","50","31 January 2010"," Dire War Disaster Movie
","Certainly the most miscast, and probably the most misconceived, War film I have ever seen. Director Bryan Singer made a modern classic with ""The Usual Suspects"" ,but his milieu is television. This comes across as a big budget / low brain effort which pulverises an essentially good story into pulp. At the heart of everything is the casting and accents. A predominantly British cast play the Germans in strong British accents, Cruise plays Stauffenberg with an American accent that veers into British from time to time. Consequently the whole film feels like a giant fancy dress party.<br/><br/>The sets, and costumes are convincing. The dialogue is not. I wanted to suspend disbelief, but when the English speaking accents are compounded by situations, speech and phrasing which are wholly un-Germanic that is nigh on impossible. In ""The Usual Suspects"", Singer started at the end and then worked back to it, a device used in ""Carlitos Way"" by Brian De Palma, and therein lies another challenge. We know what happens, the assassination plot fails, so how do you deal with that to retain dramatic tension? The answer is that Singer doesn't. De Palma created a Shakespearean tragedy, but Singer is no De Palma, and the script and story does not allow Cruise to replicate Pacino as the man condemned to an inevitable fate. So the film constantly struggles to find it's artistic raison d'etre.<br/><br/>Historically, the film is flawed. Inevitably Cruise plays Stauffenberg as the ""good guy"", the truth was far more complex, and interesting than that, but the screenplay has no time to flesh that out. There is an ongoing intrinsic conflict between what and who is right and wrong in the story. Perversely the denouement shows loyal soldiers making the right practical decisions in crushing the coup which is an odd moral to emerge as a defining theme.<br/><br/>The rise of Hitler. His mass popular support. His ability to turn proud Nationalism into ghastly genocide, and the lack of resistance to him are all big, film worthy topics. The mechanics of a coup in a powerful country, with a strong regime at War is also intriguing stuff. The conflicting demands that soldiers and citizens have to their country, their leader, and right and wrong are timeless matters. All this is squandered by a treatment that would barely get off a cartoon storyboard.<br/><br/>Frustratingly the story of the plot is a worthy theme, and the events bear critical and dramatic examination, but this offering misses the target so spectacularly that if offers nothing to the debate. For those with no interest in history, looking for straight forwards entertainment this is passable, but no more."

","Bryan Singer's latest film, Valkyrie, is a step-up from what was a long 'slog' of a movie-going experience like Superman Returns. His direction here is more in line with the X-Men franchise, oddly enough for a movie about Nazi's scheming to kill Hitler. He has what amounts to a well-oiled machine via Christopher MacQuarrie's script, and his cast assembled is a gallery of who's who in British film (yes, British people playing Nazis, without German accents, as well as Tom Cruise with his Tom Cruise accent). If only one felt a stronger bond with some of these characters like Cruise and Bill Nighy and Kenneth Branaugh play, there might really be something special about what amounts to a great idea carried out to the extent of great failure.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Tom Cruise's character, Col. Stauffenberg, explain it in one sentence in countless commercials and trailers, here's what the plot amounts to: a small group of completely fed-up Nazis plot to kill Hitler and implement operation Valkyrie which, in effect, will put the ""right"" Nazis back in power and end the war by negotiating an end to battle with the allies. This is the premise, and it is executed in a not so strange way much like the plot of a heist movie. We see the masterminds (Branaugh, Stamp, etc), bring in Stauffenberg to use his expertize and hatred of what's become with Germany as a means to pull off their plot. They also bring in some other possible 'friendlies' to their cause who will have various odd-job type tasks (i.e. Eddie Izzard's officer will make sure the phone lines are down from Hitler's operation station after the bomb goes off), and everything has to be planned and operated to the last T.<br/><br/>But, of course, as in a heist movie, we know that things wont turn out very well, or as well as anyone might like. Matter of fact, considering that instead of robbing a bank or jewels that it's taking out Hitler and his regime and implementing emergency procedures throughout Europe, it is what we expect it to be: a glorious try at something unattainable. What does make the movie fascinating is the execution of suspense as in any good conspiracy thriller (watching the tension during the first war-room meeting Hitler has with his men and as Stauffenberg awaits confirmation to set off the bomb is intense), and the striking quality of the performances. The actors all do good work- even Cruise who has the double burden of acting with one eye (or a crazy lazy/fake eye) most of the time- this in spite of or despite the fact that they're not given much in way of motivation aside from the obvious. I liked seeing the character of Stauffenberg go through the motions of executing the complex plot, but there's not much there for me to care about the human being.<br/><br/>This may not be the case for some, and if so all the better. This really is, to Singer's credit, one of those real WW2 movies with strong men played by terrific actors that... is not really great. In the right frame of mind it could, however, hit just the right spot. Valkyrie is slick, efficient storytelling."

The supporting cast was superb, plot taut and captures the heart of the resistance without getting bogged down in details, etc. If any of you are thinking about taking kids, but are wondering about possible violence, or if the story line is too convoluted for them, I thought you might be interested in my experience. Small children are better left at home, but older children (9-up. You are the best judge of your child) will do fine, with a little help. This is a movie that is Better if you know what the story is, so explain the background (who these people are, difference between the SS and regular Army, Nazis and Germans, etc.) because the beginning of the movie can be confusing if you don't know the story. You might want to do some research, too. And expect to do more explaining after you see it. My kids - 10 & 12 - were captivated all the way through, without any sign of boredom, or not understanding what was going on. The violence is no more than kids see on t.v. No blood or gore, except for a mild scene at the beginning which is just standard war movie stuff. My kids had no trouble with any of it.

","SPOILER ALERT – If you do not at least generally know how Hitler died, read no further.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is billed as a suspense movie, a thriller. My question coming in was how can that be when the audience already knows the final resolution? The answer is that it can't (or at least movie isn't).<br/><br/>I sat forward once or twice, but only in anticipation of when a tipped event would happen, not if. The emotional intensity would be professionally built every so often, but then that big gorilla sitting next to me would elbow my arm again and say ""Don't care about these people and their plan, you know what's gonna happen."" Valkyrie is not an action movie (whatever of that there is you've already seen in the commercials). Neither is it a character nor values exploration work – the plot is the almost exclusive star. It would have been different if the entire plot and movie weren't so obsessively fixated on whether or not the conspirators will kill Hitler and overthrow the Nazi government, but that is what Singer insists everyone focus on. With the ending already known, Valkyrie does not tap into more than a drop or two of the emotional juice that great movies get gushing.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie has some excellent attributes. Visuals are excellent, the scenes grand, a probing score well-utilized, the writing is at times good (even witty) and the British supporting cast is uniformly exceptional (they are the #1 reason to watch this film). But ultimately those behind Valkyrie attempt the wrong route to the audience.<br/><br/>Who knows what would have happened if Singer presented the offer to explore and identify with with any one character, presumably Stauffenberg? Yet even if he did, I don't think you would want to make that attachment...you know what is going to happen.<br/><br/>One of the central sales pitches in the Valkyrie commercials is ""what you know is just the beginning."" Problem is that what almost all of us know is the end.<br/><br/>PS: only offered me whole number, but my true judgment is a 6.5."
"kenbarr-ny","2","68","140","19 December 2008"," A Total Disappointment and Poor Way to Portray Historic Figures
","This is a movie which shows what happens when writers and directors do not trust their audience. Ultimately, Tom Cruise will get either praise or blame for what happens to it.<br/><br/>I can't blame Tom Cruise too much for this one. Both the writers and director went in to this with the mistaken notion that the audience has little knowledge of the subject matter. In fact, there are many books and documentaries about July 20 and Col. Claus von Stauffenberg. They decided to minimize character development and motivations in favor of trying to make it into a thriller. They failed because they didn't develop any of the characters to the point where an audience could understand the motivations for what they where seeing. Why didn't Stauffenberg trust the older members of the conspiracy other than the stereotypical lack of trust a younger, more driven career military man has for his elders? The audience may know Stauffenberg, but Goerdeler, von Treskow, and Beck not so much.<br/><br/>There is a major historical error towards the beginning. When Hitler visited the Russian Front at Vinnitsa, von Trescow and his aide, Fabian von Schlabrendorff, prepare a bomb disguised as brandy bottles. This occurred on 21 March 1943 and was known as Operation Flash. They get Colonel Brandt to put this bomb on Hitler's plane inside a ""case"" of brandy. The intent is to blow up Hitler's plane on its way back to his HQ. The bomb was a dud and had to be recovered. The movie shows von Trescow going to Berlin and retrieving it. In fact, it was von Schlabrendorff, who isn't identified (the billing is ""Trescow's aide"") who went to the Wolf's Lair at Rastenburg, a far more dangerous mission. This omission damages the credibility of the film. Von Schlabrendorff was arrested after Valkyrie failed and suffered horrible torture. Miraculously he survived the war due to an Allied bombing attack that destroyed The People's Court and killed Chief Judge Roland Freisler. Much of what we know about the anti-Hitler conspiracies and resistance is due to von Schlabrendorff's testimony and book written after the war. For more about this event and Fabian von Schlabrendorff, see http://www.history.com/this-day-in- history/another-plot-to-kill-Hitler-foiled .<br/><br/>Another production error is to make everyone speak with either a British or American accent. The actor who played Mertz von Quirnheim, Christian Berkel, a German actor who turned in a marvelous performance as Dr. Schenk in ""Downfall,"" is made to speak with an American accent that sounds like a bad dubbing job from a 1960s era Japanese monster flick or a spaghetti western. If everyone else can speak with their natural voices, why can't he? <br/><br/>If Tom Cruise is to bear any responsibility for the many production problems this movie has, it is that he gave the writers and director too much leeway. I wrote on several message boards that he exhibits a range of emotion from Z to Z. Ultimately, that is a director's choice. Tom Cruise has given many powerful performances and is a far better actor than this performance. Stauffenberg, by all the accounts I have read going back to Shirer's ""The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich,"" was a dynamic personality with a great deal of both charm and charisma. Normally, that would be right in Cruise's wheelhouse. Here, even when he is in a confrontational scene, the power is simply not there. Rather, it is almost robotic. I was hoping the makers of ""Valkyrie"" had seen ""Downfall,"" fleshed out the characters and through that let the suspense flow. Instead, they went with old Hollywood stereotypes of how Germans behave.<br/><br/>As someone who has studied 20th Century Germany, I thought this movie gives the audience neither heat nor light. Therefore, it is simply a poor effort."

They risked everything because they knew, in defeat, the wrongs were far too evil to excuse<br/><br/>Perhaps they were not even truly ""good"" men, but they were aware that unchecked criminal actions beget even greater darkness. Thus, these men found it in themselves to risk everything to attempt an end to the greatest personification of evil in modern time. For all their flaws they had in their core a sense of right.

","Valkyrie, a movie that's been on the map for close to a year now, that has been plagued by delays, injuries, lawsuits, government restrictions etc. Finally it is out, and boy have I been waiting for a movie like this.<br/><br/>Christopher Macquarie deserves an Oscar for his script, because this was one of the best scripts I've ever heard on screen. It was thrilling, it was intelligent, and it immersed you in this Nazi Germany World that has been displayed as One Hundred Percent pure evil, yet the script shows you that there were good people there who were just following orders, who's number one priority wasn't just killing Jews. The script has some very memorable lines, lines like: ""By nightfall I want to know that Hitler's Germany has seen it's last sunrise."", or ""We have to show the world, that not all of us were like him."" It is so beautifully written, that Macquarie has my vote for the Oscar.<br/><br/>If there was an Oscar called Best overall acting, then Valkyrie would win it. Tom Cruise is very good as Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, an injured Nazi, who is very displeased with the way Hitler runs the show in Berlin. Cruise is good, but not great, I don't know if this is the one performance to revitalize his career. The other actors are even better. Kenneth Branagh delivers a chilling performance as a Major-General Henning Von Terscow who is extremely displeased with Hitler and the Nazi regime. Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean's Davy Jones) gives an outstanding performance as General Olbricht, one of the Generals who sits around in Berlin commanding the reserve army. Nighy plays his character perfectly, from the stiff body, to his fiery temper, yet indecisiveness. Tom Wilkinson, coming off his Emmy winning performance as Benjamin Franklin, delivers probably one of the best performances of his career as General Fredrick Frohm. Wilkinson brings his incredible fire and vigor to the character, and always leaves you wondering who's side Frohm is on. Claurice Van Outen plays Nina Von Stauffenberg, Claus' wife. Though she has few lines, Van outen shows you that Mrs. Stauffenberg sacrificed more than any of the soldiers. She sacrificed her husband, her children, and herself.<br/><br/>Terrance Stamp delivers once again as resigned General Ludwig Beck, who is going to be the mastermind behind this whole plot. Stamp brings his awesome accent to this very complicated character. Eddie Izzard plays a party loving General Erich Fellgiebell. Izzard has some incredible lines, in which he delivers them perfectly. Christian Berkel plays the explosives expert, and assistant to General Olbricht Colonel Mertz Von Quirnhem. Berkel's character is very important, and he gives you this sense that Mertz will kill Hitler even if it means losing his own life. I think the best performance of the movie may have come from a little known actor Jamie Parker who plays Lieutenant Werner Von Haeften, Stauffenberg's right hand man. Parker shows you that Haeftan loved Stauffenberg deeply, and that he would do anything to save Stauffenberg, and at the end of the movie they really show you how strong this relationship between Stauffenberg and Haeften is. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer does an amazing job as the director for the movie. He makes the excellent choice not to use CGI (Computer Generated Imagery), and instead shoot everything on location. The cinematography is beautiful, and very well done. Singer gives you the perfect explanation at the beginning of the movie for why they don't speak German, or English with a German accent. Singer also does an excellent job of just creating this uncertainty whenever Hitler is on screen. You never know what Hitler is going to do next, because Singer shows you that he is Adolf Hitler, he is the greatest madman to ever walk the face of the earth. Singer makes sure that the historical side to the movie has documentary like accuracy. All that this movie's been through I think Singer should at least get nominated for an Oscar as director.<br/><br/>Valkyire will keep you on the edge of your seat, it will entertain you, it will immerse you in this World War II world, and most importantly it will show you that these men and women gave the greatest sacrifice of all to save humanity from the greatest madmen ever, Adolf Hitler. I would highly recommend this movie to any who wishes that Hitler had been killed before the damage had been done....I hope that is everyone."

","A powerful movie. The stark fear these men felt as they plotted to overthrow one of the most evil regimes the world has ever seen was well portrayed. To fail would mean not only their own deaths, but the deaths of their families as well. It was little wonder some of them hesitated when it came time to make that call. The bit where Stauffenberg turns to the portrait of Hitler and asks ""Do you know how this war will end? The portrait will be unhung, and the man will be hung"" then turns to von Haeften, the young man he's interviewing, and says ""I am involved in high-treason by all means available to me. Can I count you in?"" Just blew my mind. I think if I had been von Haeften at that moment, I'd have run screaming from the room. A well crafted film in every respect. Stands like a giant, head-and-shoulders above the morass of mediocrity (and worse) that is modern film-making."
"commandercool88","6","4","5","3 January 2009"," Amazing story, decent movie.
","Colonel Stauffenberg's plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler extends well beyond the limitations of any Hollywood film. It is a source of great pride for many Germans, telling the story of few standing up to many in the face of daunting odds. 'Valkyrie', in the hands of a capable director such as Bryan Singer, could and should have been much better. But as it stands, this latest Tom Cruise vehicle is at the very least a decent and relatively entertaining attempt to retell a fascinating moment in history.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspect about 'Valkyrie' is, despite us knowing the outcome even before walking into the theater, its ability to build enough tension that for a few brief moments we may actually believe that Stauffenberg and his men will actually succeed in their mission. It has to be the biggest strength for this picture, anything less than convincing would have been an utter failure. I knew very little about the July 20th plot going into the film, and I can honestly say I was staggered at how far the plot advanced and how close these men came to succeeding.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise may actually receive more awards consideration for his bizarre turn in 'Tropic Thunder' than his portrayal as the national hero in 'Valkyrie'. Though that shouldn't undercut what is an otherwise okay performance. A bit stiff, but he's far from being the distraction many feared. Performances from the entire cast are rather solid, and the choice to cast mostly English actors may seem strange, but it really doesn't take us out of the movie or become anything problematic. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, and Jamie Parker all fit into their roles nicely to provide 'Valkyrie' a sturdy supporting cast.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 'Valkyrie' never quite resonates as the profound historical thriller it aspires to be. The script never goes nearly as deep as I would have liked, we're given little access to background information that may have allowed the film to resonate much more strongly. Bryan Singer's typical character driven approach never fully resonates, leaving something to be desired in the emotional department. But as it stands, a fine editing job helps the good outweigh the bad. This is an amazing story on its own right, even if it doesn't translate to a great film. 'Valkyrie' reminds us that moral responsibility should never be sacrificed for personal gain. That even when death is almost certain, it is not failure. An intriguing and important history lesson, no doubt.<br/><br/>More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
"PWNYCNY","8","15","27","25 December 2008"," Tom Cruise gives a strong and dignified performance.
","A prudent movie goer approaches with caution any commercial movie that purports to be based on an actual historical event. Usually by the time the movie is released the facts are so distorted as to render the actual event almost unrecognizable. Surprisingly this movie is an exception. Although the actual assassination attempt on Hitler failed, this movie succeeds in establishing and maintaining the level of suspense required to keep the audience engaged. Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly strong and dignified performance as the German officer who plays a crucial role in planning and implementing the plot. The supporting cast, which includes several outstanding English actors including Terence Stamp who plays an uncharacteristically sympathetic role, are also excellent. What makes this movie especially effective is that it avoids stereotyping the Germans as a bunch of goose-stepping Nazis or in the case of the assassins a bunch of frantic anti-Nazi fanatics and instead stays true to the story which involves a group of individuals trying to stop a war against all odds. That they fail is not the point because the audience already knows that. Rather, that they were willing to take action at all is what makes this movie a special cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Another interesting feature of this movie is its treatment of how the German soldiers, including the plotters, dealt with the loyalty oath that every German soldier swore to Adolf Hitler. This meant that the mere thought of opposing Hitler was tantamount not only to committing treason but acting with dishonor which would cause that soldier to be held in utmost contempt by his fellow soldiers, a disgrace that few soldiers could endure. (Of course, when one considers who the German soldiers were fighting for and the crimes many of them committed in the name of their leader, one must question the extent to which ethical considerations played a role in anything the German soldiers did.)<br/><br/>Now here's the negatives about this movie. What is especially ironic is that while the Germans were invading countries, committing genocide and killing people by the millions, they could not assassinate one person. The Germans were systematically murdering Jews - they had no qualms about THAT - but apparently killing the Fuehrer was another story. Remember, the plotters were senior military officers, not unarmed civilians, who had access to all the weapons they needed to to the job. Yes, the Germans were very ""brave"" when fighting unarmed Jews but when it came to dealing with their Fuehrer, the person to whom they voluntarily swore allegiance, then their bravery failed them. Where was the opposition on September 1, 1939 (when Germany invaded Poland)? Or on June 21, 1941 (when Germany invaded the Soviet Union)? May 29, 1942 (when the British obliterated Cologne)? Or on January 30, 1943 (when the Soviet Union captured the German 6th Army at Stalingrad)? This doesn't make the assassination attempt any less significant but it should be placed within an historical context. History records that Adolf Hitler was adored ... indeed loved ... by the German people, a fact that the German people will have to deal with for a long time to come. Germans opposed Adolf Hitler? So what? Too little, too late. And who were they to repudiate their oath of allegiance? Guided by a misplaced sense of honor, they chose to follow the Fuehrer, so they had no cause to complain. The Fuehrer had not duped them, they had duped themselves. This movie teaches that one should take great care to whom to swear allegiance. The same officers who plotted against Hitler also participated in aggressive war which set the stage for genocide. That they had second thoughts about the direction the war was going is commendable but it does not absolve them of their own complicity in implementing Hitler's policies."

","Valkyrie features Tom Cruise as star and producer of a true story about a group of German officers who made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler and launch a government coup over Germany in order to spare the country a more merciful surrender pact with the Allied forces. Despite a few setbacks, Valkyrie is an impressively well-crafted political thriller.<br/><br/>Chief among these setbacks is Tom Cruise, himself, which is somewhat a disappointment because this man has taken a lot of beatings from the press and general public over the last couple of years and I'm usually one of his starch defenders. Cruise doesn't even attempt a German accent and doesn't really inject any personality into the role. It's ridiculously hard to suspend your disbelief and think you're watching anything other than some strange time travelling story of Tom Cruise playing himself inserted into 1944 Germany. But Cruise produced and bankrolled the film and stuck with it through several release date delays, so credit goes to him on that. Fortunately on the acting front, Cruise is surrounded by a really solid cast: Among others, Bill Nighy, Terrence Stamp (My Boss' Daughter, Get Smart), and Tom Wilkinson, fresh off his amazing performance in Michael Clayton last year. Wilkinson's character as a top general with loyalties to Hitler could have been someone you could have built an entire movie around. <br/><br/>As in the X-Men series, director Bryan Singer doesn't just jump into the action but takes his time building suspense, even if the score is annoyingly over-dramatic at parts (it sounded like a horror film). If you're expecting an action film, you're bound to be disappointed. It's more of a backdoor political piece that reminded me a little bit of The Contender. For the first half of the film, Cruise is just going from Nazi official to Nazi official trying to find the right allies and gather signatures to enact his grandiose plan. The payoff is well-worth it, however. It's thought-provoking, tragic, and well-shot."

One can see some of the elements of The Usual Suspects. I repeat again, while TUS was an out and out thriller with one of the best climaxes ever, this movie's ending was always known. I do believe that adding a clever twit in the end isn't THAT difficult (no offense to TUS) but to create a drama when the whole world knows what happened in the end needs master direction, and that's exactly what Singer did.<br/><br/>I'll be watching it again, and maybe I'll find some revealing mistakes, some scenes that don't quite add up. But it seemed like a really good movie to me the first time, and since once is about as many times I watch most movies, I'll remember this one."
"regan1300","9","5","7","24 January 2009"," Desperate bravery by the conspirators
","I saw a discussion of this film by a bunch art/culture critics on a TV show. They all said the film was poor (or words to that effect). The following day I had agreed to go to the movies with my 13 year old son in the afternoon. When the appointed time arrived he checked the theatre's film schedule. Valkyrie was the only film available at that time and that he was old enough to watch. So I had him check IMDb (in an attempt to dissuade him (thinking Valkyrie would be trashed by IMDb reviewers). To my surprise it got good reviews (as well as bad ones of course). So off we went. Now for some reason I was never really a huge fan of Tom Cruise although I'm not saying all his film are rubbish  he's been in plenty of good ones and I believe he is a very good actor  but I wasn't really expecting to enjoy Valkyrie because TC was staring Anyhow the film turned out to be very good. Cruise was very good. The rest of the cast was very good. Oddly, it did take a few minutes for me to come to terms with none of the actors making any attempt to affect a German accent!. One of the other IMDb reviewers said something about the film should have been a 'made for TV' movie. But, it looked absolutely fabulous on the big screen. The thing that really came across was the bravery of the conspirators and the despair as they realised their beloved Germany was doomed and they were being lead by a man who was close to insanity. I can usually tell when a movie isn't holding the audiences attention  people start shuffle around etc. Valkyrie seemed to have the audience enthralled. When the credits came on everyone just stayed in their seats for a good 30 seconds (normally folks get straight up when the credits appear). My 13 year old thought the film was fantastic - he was really surprised when it because obvious at the end that the film was based on true events. Maybe this type of film is not for everyone but for critics to say it was rubbish is beyond understanding. Roll on IMDb reviews  professional film critics are no more qualified to pass judgement on film than I am (or any other member of the public)."
"isabelle1955","Null","5","7","4 January 2009"," Anticipating the Inevitable.
","I enjoyed this movie and I'm not sure why it's been given such a lukewarm reception by critics. Operation Valkyrie's had several previous treatments on TV and in movies, both fictionalized and documentary, by the Brits and the Germans, but this is probably the highest profile attempt yet. It's well made, with a strong script, good production values, appropriate music and a flawless roster of actors. In fact the cast practically amounts to a roll call of every decent, middle-aged, British male actor currently working, with a sprinkling of Americans and Germans thrown in for good measure. The real problem with the movie is that right from the beginning we know the inevitable, depressing outcome of the story, so it amounts to two hours of watching a juggernaut gather speed and momentum but knowing it will eventually plunge off a cliff into tragic oblivion. It's just a case of how it gets there. <br/><br/>I was raised on a constant stream of stories of WW2 (my parents survived the London Blitz and when I was born in the 1950s, WW2 was something still spoken of literally every day. It wasn't history, it was very recent daily life) so I approached Valkyrie with a sense of gloom at the tragic, known outcome - a plan to assassinate Hitler going horribly wrong and heading for disaster like a train heading for a pile up at the buffers while you stand there watching it happen, unable to intervene. But I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would.<br/><br/>I think it's important that films like this are still made. WW2 happened in very recent history, but already too many people have quite forgotten about it; they have forgotten about Hitler, the Nazis, the Death Camps and the huge war that tore the world apart. Unfortunately I suspect it will be mostly people of my generation who go watch it. Of course no one nowadays is raised on stories of WW2 as I was, but nonetheless we shouldn't forget.<br/><br/>The Operation Valkyrie of the title, was a plan developed for the Reserve portion of the German Army and approved by Hitler himself. It was intended to be used in the event of a breakdown in law and order within Germany or the countries it occupied, a breakdown caused by Hitler's death or civil unrest. A group of officers who were a part of the German Resistance to Hitler, could see the way the war was heading, that Europe was being laid waste and Germany was losing, and they were also disturbed at aspects of Nazi rule - the Death Camps for instance and the killing of civilians  so they plotted to kill Hitler and utilize an amended Operation Valkyrie for their own ends to take control of the nation after Hitler's death and to negotiate a truce with the Allies. If it had worked, they would have used Hitler's own plan against him. But crucial to the plan was Hitler's death. The plot was aborted once, and when finally carried out in 1944, failed to kill its target. Poor communication, indecision on the part of some of the plotters and a late start in implementing Valkyrie led to complete failure and within hours all the plotters had been rounded up and executed.<br/><br/>The plot was lead by Colonel Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) who was put in charge of Valkyrie and made Chief of Staff to General Fromm, after being badly injured fighting in N. Africa . He had access to Hitler but was also to be vital in the follow up to the assassination, which  according to a source I read online  ruled out a suicide attack. Which was a pity, because as I watched this, I couldn't help pondering how much the course of history might have been changed had Stauffenberg chosen the current favored method of assassins, the suicide bomb. Had he got closer to Hitler at that fateful meeting and sacrificed himself, instead of leaving the bomb under a solidly built wooden table which helped shield the Fuehrer from the blast, the whole course of history since 1944 might have been different. Still, it wasn't to be. Hitler was dead anyway nine months later, committing suicide in his Berlin bunker as the Allies approached. Berlin was carved up amongst the Allies, the Death Camps were finally liberated and the Cold War began. <br/><br/>Tom Wilkinson plays General Fromm, who was commander of the Reserve Army, and the only person apart from Hitler who could put Operation Valkyrie into effect. He ordered the execution of Stauffenberg and the other plotters but was himself executed in 1945. Other plotters included General Olbricht (Bill Nighy), Colonel von Quirnheim (Christian Berkel), Lieutenant von Haeften (Jamie Parker), General Beck (Terence Stamp making a rare appearance as a goody) and Fellgiebel (comedian Eddie Izzard  an interesting piece of casting but very effective.) They are all excellent. The location shooting is perfect, often using the real life settings in Germany (for instance the plotters are executed by firing squad in the courtyard of the real Bendlerstrasse.) The lack of German accents (widely commented on) is quite appropriate. Given that everyone in the movie would have been speaking German, there is no need to give them distracting accents at all. The use of accents is really only necessary when the audience is expected to distinguish between several different nationalities in a movie.<br/><br/>As for Cruise, well I've always thought Tom Cruise a perfectly good actor. The problem is that his private life has become so high profile and the subject of so much speculation and even ridicule, that it's now hard to watch him playing a serious character on screen. Which is a pity. He will obviously bring an audience to this movie, but I can't honestly say that he brings much weight. Nonetheless it's well worth the investment of ten bucks and a couple of hours."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","9","15","15 August 2009"," History told Hollywood style.
","Well, this movie was a bit of a disappointment. It had all of the right ingredients in it needed to make a great and interesting movie with but yet it really wasn't one. It had Tom Cruise, Bryan Singer as director, a fascinating and a based on true events story but the movie just made some wrong choices in the process.<br/><br/>The movie really isn't handling its story very well. Instead of telling the story honest and with respect it tells it spectacular and overblown. The movie is too Hollywood-like for its story and the real story and characters deserved a better treatment.<br/><br/>But even so, the movie is trying to be Hollywood-like, it yet doesn't even fully succeed in this neither. The movie just isn't spectacular enough to watch for this. There aren't any big shoot-outs or a spectacular ending in which everything reaches a conclusion. There often is more talking than action, so I actually have no clue at which audiences they were aiming. Singer made the same mistake before with ""Superman Returns"".<br/><br/>The movie also made a bad choice with its casting. Nothing wrong with Tom Cruise in his role, even though its also far from his most memorable one but casting some very British actors in some very German roles was simply a horrible choice. The accents did really bother and it was often quite laughable hearing a high placed German commander talking with a very thick British accent. Especially Hitler's voice really bothered me. Sure, the actor that played him (David Bamber) looked well enough like him but he sounded absolutely nothing like him at all. For all I cared they should had called in something to dub his voice but they didn't even bothered with it. It's a shame that most actors feel so out of place within this movie, since the movie does certainly feature some great actors in it, such as of course Tom Cruise but also Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp and Thomas Kretschmann, among many others.<br/><br/>It's of course a good looking movie and it's also put together professionally with its directing, editing, cinematography, music and such and it also certainly wasn't a cheap movie to make but this simply does not make the movie better or more interesting to watch. It just prevents it from being a total disaster to watch and gives the movie more than enough to still consider this simply a watchable one.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"ccthemovieman-1","7","9","15","21 May 2009"," A Decent Film, But Not Quite Up To The Hype
","Most of you already know the story - an attempt on Adolph Hitler's life during the final year of World War II. It's a historically-faithful film to what really happened, so that's a big plus. Most times, much of these ""based on a true event"" stories are mostly fiction. Not here....except for the accents. (All the Germans sound English or American.) <br/><br/>In a nutshell, the good news is the realism of the story and the nice photography and sets. You really feel you are in Nazi Germany in the 1940s. The bad news is that the story often gets a bit confusing and the supposed good-guy, ""Col. Claus von Stuffenberg,"" played by Tom Cruise, sometimes is a little obnoxious. Maybe it's just Cruise. Man, I actually know some people who hate that actor so much they watched this film and rooted for Hitler!! Well, I won't go that far by any stretch, but I will say the movie is only so-so, a little disappointing in that the story was dragged on too long. Boy, those coming attractions were really misleading, making this look like an action-packed, super suspense film. Well, it had little action and the suspense was fair-at-best, especially since people know Hitler was never assassinated. The only suspense was finding out how this particular plot failed....and the filmmakers took forever in telling us.<br/><br/>For people with Blu-Ray players who want to know, ""How does this look and sound?"" It looks very good and sounds terrific. The colors are rich and most scenes are very sharp. A few are slightly soft but I think those were intentional. Overall, it's a pretty film with very little CGI. The sound was particularly impressive considering there was very little action. Most of it takes place in the beginning of the film. Most of the movie is talk, but you can hear voices out of all speakers and get terrific surround on odd things like a room full of typewriters clicking away. Overall, the audio was extremely impressive.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is decent and worth seeing, but did live up to expectations."
"vip_ebriega","7","8","13","28 February 2009"," Good production values and great cast, despite flaws.
","My Take: Tom Cruise and the strong ensemble cast make this an effective popcorn thriller, even if the ending is well-known.<br/><br/>Don't let it's initial appearance fool you! Though it may sound like a cinematic browse through history books, VALKYRIE, even with its detailed recreation of the almost-successful assassination of The Fuhrer, is a slick, entertaining Hollywood popcorn thriller. Sure, it's crammed with details, but as entertainment, it's more than serviceable, and yet it doesn't falter to the usual Hollywood trappings. VALKYRIE is that sincere kind of Hollywood entertainment that doesn't let Hollywood turn it into something it's not.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is actually very convincing, not letting his popularity get in the way as a distraction, as one-handed, one-eyed Nazi Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Worried about how his family would live under Hitler's Germany, he joins a crack team of conspirators (think OCEAN'S ELEVEN with Nazi uniforms) on a plot to assassinate Hitler (eerily played by David Bamber) and take over his Germany. Ironically, their operation (Operation: Valkyrie) was meant for coups like these.<br/><br/>It ain't nearly the most thrilling movie set on offices and war shelters, and it ain't much of a history lesson either. but perhaps the biggest fault of the film is its lack of real suspense or danger. Since we know how it all ends, the suspense being built around the first two acts aren't quite as gripping as its supposed to. But VALKYRIE gets the job done. It's thrilling down to the scenes where the team tries to sneak bombs in near Hitler's side or the scene where Stauffenberg has a one-on-one meeting with The Fuhrer. Terrific performances abound, especially the kind of quality performance we expect from a cast that includes Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp. Director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie does stick to some of the facts, even if its faithfulness takes some of the excitement away from it. It may not be the most suspenseful thriller ever to come out in years, but it's nonetheless effective. VALKYRIE delivers, flaws aside. <br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."
"teacher_tom516","9","8","13","20 February 2009"," Why the Nazis are NOT the bad guys... (SPOILERS)
","... at least until the movie ends.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of complaints about how Hitler was a rather sad looking old man who wasn't scary and would never hurt a fly, much less a Jew, and how the Nazis didn't seem like the bad guys - in fact they seemed almost sympathetic - according to some reviewers.<br/><br/>Well, after thinking about it a lot here's what I think is the rationale behind it. The movie tries to take us into this world where people are disappearing, arrested by the Gestapo, you hear wild rumors of Jews being executed but you don't actually see it. All you see are your brother officers and all you have is their word.<br/><br/>Finally when we hear Hitler's voice speaking to Remer, the gloves are off. We see the executions, we see the show trials, we hear Hitler's voice on the radio and we see that yea, the Nazis really are the bad guys.<br/><br/>The movie, to its credit, doesn't make up characters but it DOES conflate characters or change roles slightly to allow for maximum economy of characterization. Off the cuff I remember: <br/><br/>Goerdeler - conflated slightly with Gisevius and the part of the group which was idealistic, civilian and kind of anti-Stauffenberg <br/><br/>Pompous general - Supposed to be Wehrkreis III commander Joachim von Kortzfleisch but I guess they wanted to make him look more pompously over bearing and less sympathetic (and Ian McNeice is certainly one to make it work!) rather than being 'a simple soldier who'd rather be pulling weeds in his garden'.<br/><br/>Africa Korps general - probably supposed to be von Broich but he's given a generic name and killed off. He probably represents the prior efforts of the resistance to recruit the likes of Manstein and later Rommel. I think this might have been problematic as a lot of people apparently thought he WAS Rommel! <br/><br/>von Haeften - takes the roles of all the ADC's, Klausing, etc.<br/><br/>Mertz von Quirnheim - takes the roles of Stieff/Gersdorff in procuring and explaining the explosives as well as the role of Thiele in taking Fellgiebel's call.<br/><br/>Major Freyend and General Tresckow take the roles that their subordinates (Sgt.Vogler and von Schlabrendorff respectively) historically had - again for the sake of both economy of characters and making sure the lead characters are the ones who are active, rather than having a lot of active minor characters.<br/><br/>We hear references to Helmuth Stieff, Col.Linstow and General Bieler as well in the dialogue. It's really nice to think that the writers weren't just pulling names out of their rear ends as is the case in a lot of Hollywood historical epics.<br/><br/>There is some measure of dramatic license in the scenes but this is always done to concisely condense what would have taken at least 3 more characters an 1-2 more scenes to explain if the history was strictly adhered to.<br/><br/>The movie does suffer slightly from shallower characterization than a lot hoped for but this isn't because the actors acted poorly - to the contrary they did the best with what they got. Unfortunately, because of the demands of the genre, what they got sometimes wasn't enough to really give us a good glimpse of their characters. <br/><br/>As it was Witzleben seems virtually irrelevant, which is tragic as he has the hands down BEST end speech during the Volksgericht trials, Beck is reduced to the 'father figure' who Cruise's Stauffenberg is trying to please - a sort of conflation of Ludwig Beck and Stefan George perhaps! - but his role as Stauffenberg's PRECURSOR, the one who would have had his finger on the trigger or the one arming the bomb in 1938, is absent. Goerdeler is reduce to the role of hostile and idealistic opponent to the practical and decisive Stauffenberg and his role as one of the key founders of the Resistance, his opposition to the Nazis over the Mendelsohn statue and his complex nature and naiveté is likewise absent.<br/><br/>To its credit though, the movie does not pander. It uses its dialogue concisely, smartly and effectively. They look and sound like the officers we've read of in books. A lot of people in my experience really tend to respond on a purely emotional level to cinema. They need to have their pulse raising not because of what someone says or explains but because of what they see. A lot in this film is explained through dialogue, through exposition (though there are, fortunately, matching images particularly when discussing the bombing plans) and if you're not paying attention you won't make the connection.<br/><br/>I can appreciate how well the filmmakers did and how they really tried hard to be true to history even if it went AGAINST THE GRAIN of what so many people think the Nazis/German were because of learned stereotyping. But most people can't - they only see 'actors' behaving like they're in a script which ""wasn't researched"" where Cruise wears an eye-patch. To this younger generation raised on stereotypes and sweeping generalizations and MTV - where images carry so much power and are so ingrained into their consciousness that when they see the German WW2 uniform they immediately think ""NAZI"" (regardless of whether that uniform was Waffen SS or POSTAL WORKER - those Reich mailmen had IIRC a really sinister looking black uniform so much so that some of those poor sods were shot by vengeful Allied troops and partisans because they thought they were SS!) - they're just not going to get it. That is, IMHO, a problem if not a major ""weakness"" of the movie - you're gonna have to actually THINK, READ, RESEARCH, DO YOUR HOMEWORK to appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>Heaven forbid a movie forces us to actually use our heads."

","The people who create movie trailers can make any ole thing look good, so I was afraid to get my hopes up too high for ""Valkyrie."" Well, surprise, surprise, ""Valkyrie"" not only lived up to my expectations, it greatly exceeded them.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Claus Von Stauffenberg, a colonel in the German Army who is gravely wounded in North Africa and shipped back to Berlin to recover. Known for his strong anti-Hitler views, he is recruited into a group of German generals who are plotting to over-throw Hitler. Very soon Von Stauffenberg finds himself in charge of the plan. He decides they must kill Hitler and use Hitler's own reserve army to overthrow the government. It's in ingenious plan. Too bad, as one general reminds him, ""Things never go according to plan."" <br/><br/>The first hour is build-up to the second, which is the day of the assassination attempt, from start to finish. If you need to take a potty break, I strongly recommend that you do it before the second hour begins. It's the tensest, most exciting hour I've ever spent at the movies. You won't want to miss a minute! <br/><br/>Much has been said about the supporting cast of heavyweight British actors, and they are, indeed, wonderful. But I'd like to say a word about Tom Cruise. His performance in this movie was a revelation. He brings a quiet dignity to the role of Von Stauffenberg that I really did not expect from the guy who jumped up and down on Oprah's sofa. Perhaps the beating he's been taking in the press for the last couple of years has forced him to grow up. Whatever it is, he really holds his own, in company with those wonderful British actors.<br/><br/>But ultimately Tom Cruise is not the star of this movie; the story is. And it's a great one!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","9","14 February 2009"," Only one type of audience will be disappointed  fanatic Wagner fans
","A portion of the audience will walk into the theatre thinking that ""Operation Valkyrie"" is about a plot to assassinate Hitler. That is actually not correct. Rather, it has to do with the first question Colonel Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) asks when he is recruited into the conspiracy: ""What happens after that?"" Meaning ""what happens after Hitler is killed"", Stauffenberg is the only one smart enough to see the illusion of the plotters that their own popularity alone is sufficient to get things under control. Something elaborately planned and meticulously executed is needed to allow the well-meaning plotters to prevent chaos and put the country into an orderly state before surrendering to the Allies. That something is ""Valkyrie"".<br/><br/>The plot is to kill Hitler with a bomb planted at a military strategy meeting and immediate trigger ""Operation Valkyrie"" to spread the words that the SS is attempting a coup. Friendly military units will be mobilized to take control of various sections of the country in support of a new leader. After an abortive first attempt, the second try works as Satuffenberg walks away from the meeting chamber just before the bomb he personally planted explodes. Off he goes to kick-start ""Valkyrie"" with his fellow conspirators. Things all work according to plan, except for one little detail  Hilter is not killed, but only slightly wounded.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go into any more details. Suffices to say that even when we all know that Hitler was not killed in this (or any other) assassination attempt, the movie is filled with palpable, gripping tension from beginning to end. Throughout the movie, most of which is without background music and indeed often without any sound at all, our hearts pound with every turn of event, small and large, that affect the fate of this group of people that we root for right from the start.<br/><br/>The cast is superb, with Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp playing three of the key figures in the conspiracy. Tom Wilkinson plays the general who, with some persuasion, joins the cause and gets very close to becoming the man who saves Germany from the humiliation of a defeat under Hitler. Tom Hollander is the military man who, carrying out his orders with strict discipline, turns from initially assisting the conspiracy (unwittingly) to crushing it. There is also an ensemble of good German actors whom the audience would probably vaguely recognize from an assortment of Hollywood movies. Decidedly wasted is the talent of Carice van Houten (resplendent in ""Black Book"" (2006)) playing Satuffenberg's wife, with little to do (but still managing to do quite well).<br/><br/>One particular interesting point an average user of today's communication technology cannot help but notice is how power and control rely so much on communication  dispatching and receiving of information. You then wonder that in today's communication landscape of SMS message and the like, how much the plan ""Operation Walkyrie"" will need to be re-written? Just to close off with my summary line, it would probably be fair to say that most Wagner fans would love the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" theme from ""Die Walkure"", second of the four operas in his legendary ""Ring Cycle"". But if they are attracted to this movie by the title, they will be disappointed to find there is less than 30 seconds of the music that they will hear, as played from a record. Far better to watch ""Apocalypse now"" (1979) if that's what they're after."

","Valkyrie was in incredibly accurate film with regard to what actually happened on this particular plot to kill Hitler. Of course, they had to embellish a bit on the details they didn't know about. Tom Cruise, though I'm not a fan, did an excellent job portraying his character as did much of the cast. The battle scenes were sparse but very well done, and the uniforms were very much accurate. I swear, I don't know how Hollywood does it, but the sets for WWII Germany are immaculate. Furthermore, the story is just incredibly well-told, if you've read any book on the matter.<br/><br/>I think the reason some people didn't like this movie was that they got lost in the history of the plot -- They don't really explain who or what the SS really were or represented, and failed a bit to really explain the importance of the main characters trying to change certain directives during the plot. This makes sense, of course, if you are knowledgeable about WWII Germany or the Nazi Party, but I think this was lost on some viewers. Kids these days...<br/><br/>If you like to read about history, war, or are at all interested in an accurate film on the plot to kill Hitler, you should definitely see this movie.<br/><br/>As an aside, I have many friends who didn't see the movie because they heard that they don't use German accents when they speak... Are you kidding me?? First, they adequetly transition from German to English in the first few minutes of the movie so you don't have to watch a subtitle film, and second, Good Lord! Does having an actor with a false German accent playing a German character really make a difference? Remember Enemy at the Gates? All the Russian soldiers had British accents. Did anyone complain?? Did anyone criticize 13th Warrior for the same transition?"

","Some day, perhaps years or decades from now, when Tom Cruise's Oprah antics and Scientology ramblings have faded into distant memory, people will reflect upon his acting legacy and evaluate him as a pretty decent actor who chose some interesting roles ranging from a suburban rich kid in Risky Business to a US Union officer in Japan (The Last Samurai), a vampire, and against-type as an anti-hero hit-man in Collateral.<br/><br/>With Valkyrie you can add eye-patch-wearing Nazi to the list as Cruise portrays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg in the failed July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler.<br/><br/>Directed by Bryan Singer (Superman Returns), Valkyrie sports an impressive ensemble cast as players in the failed coup that, had it succeeded, likely would have ended the war and prevented Germany from being partitioned by the allies.<br/><br/>Sticking closely to historical accounts, Singer and screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander do a good job a delivering what is essentially a big budget rendering of a docu-drama that you'd expect to find on A&E or the History channel. While the details are up to snuff, and the acting uniformly excellent, what's missing is any sort of insight into the motivation of the coup plotters beyond the obvious desire to unseat a megalomaniac who was driving their country to destruction.<br/><br/>Whereas history tells us that von Stauffenberg and other senior officers, all largely from aristocratic backgrounds, were motivated by various ideals and morals ranging from the religious to philosophical, economic and political, virtually none of this is conveyed in the in the film. Lip service is paid to their collective desire to free their fellow Germans from the group-think that has their country in its grip, but human motivation is, and was, more nuanced than that.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the unfolding of events is laden with more than enough drama to carry the film, and the portrayal of opportunistic fence sitters such as Tom Wilkinson's General Friedrich Fromm, whose sole interest was being on whichever side won the day, adds further tension to the story.<br/><br/>Cruise is surprisingly good as the maimed and decorated Colonel whose inclusion among Hitler's inner circle allowed him to get close enough to plant the bomb, as well as co-ordinate the details of Operation Valkyrie - a plan approved by the Fuhrer himself to mobilize the Reich's military reserve units to maintain order in the event of his death.<br/><br/>Valkyrie offers much more than a mere showcase for the world's most famous Scientologist. While more could have been delivered, it is true to the source and will leave you wondering how different today's world might be had these men succeeded in their actions."

There is no narrator in the movie explaining the events so if you don't already know what's going on, you're going to have to pay attention to every word and detail to catch up on what is happening (there is not much action and lots of conversation in the beginning of the movie).<br/><br/>Overall, whether or not you're a history buff, this movie is a must-see.

After suffering a terrible injury after a British attack, Von Stauffenberg is relocated to Berlin, were as fortune would have it, he comes across the conspirators who are trying to kill Hitler but have failed in their last 14 attempts.

Using Hitler's own plan ""Valkyrie"", the emergency plan for the military to retain control if the Wolf's Lair ever became cut off, Von Stauffenberg comes up with a fool proof plan to eliminate one of the most evil men in history.<br/><br/>Thus begins one of the most tense two hours I have spent in the cinema as you will the conspirators to succeed and fret at every step of the way that the SS or Gestapo may be on their heels, ready to burst through a door any second and take down each and every one of them. The mood of the period and the attention to detail is excellent, with one of the best ensemble casts of the year so far. Singer's direction is great and I for one learnt a hell of a lot about just how close we came to ending the second world war nine months early.<br/><br/>The thing I find strangest about this film is the critical mauling the film has received. Everyone I have spoken to has loved it, found it fascinating and came away with a desire to learn even more about Stauffenberg and the rest of the conspirators, so what's with the downplaying of it. I imagine one reason is the fact that the media have it in for Cruise at the moment and so he can't do anything right, even when he's on form. I also think that the fact that there aren't that many speaking roles for women in the film is another reason for some negative reactions. Well here's the thing about that focus group folks, THERE WEREN'T ANY WOMEN GENERALS THEN! I don't expect action heroes to suddenly start shooting the set up on ""When Harry met Sally"", ""How to lose a guy in 10 days"" or ""50 first dates"", so deal with the women's roles in this film.<br/><br/>I think the other reason that many people find a film like this hard-going is that it's hard from them to separate the Nazi's from the German army at the time or understand the sanctity of the oath they took towards the Furher or the reasons why? This is not an easy war film or one that fits into our perceptions like many of the Vietnam war pictures do. This gives us a moment in time when, if things had gone better, millions of lives could have been saved.<br/><br/>Don't believe the gripe! <br/><br/>Nuff said."

Thomas Kretscmann and Tom Wilkinson, the movie is directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is natural in his role as Von Stauffenberg and he has shown the intensity in his acting in such role as has Kenneth Brannagh. The movie itself recreates the atmosphere of the time and goes on to give the audience the feeling that they are witnessing an event in history. But what makes it lean more towards to make this is that it shows the bombardment of the German capital, Berlin. Factually correct, this movie depicts the last plot that was hatched to remove Hitler, the Reich Fuehrer Heinrich Himmler, the propaganda minister Josef Goebbels and also Herman Goering, commander in chief of the Luftwaffe.<br/><br/>This is a very intense drama that is really worth while watching and more so for those who are interested in the Second World War events."

He and all involved in making this movie, deserve a good turn out. It made me get by book, The Bunker, out and am now reading it again. It also reminds us that many, many Germans were not like the SS and the Nazis that were involved in the holocaust. The plot moves right along and you are never bored; sometimes found my heart racing!

","Without question, this is a well made movie, and the story is told in a compelling, engaging way even though we all know it's going to turn out badly for our hero. The costumes, props, everything is superbly well turned out.<br/><br/>The characters involved in the plot are also interesting, each with their own internal conflicts. The interplay between political and military thinking is fascinating to watch. I had never before considered ""so what happens after Hitler is dead?"" which took up the greater part of the planning and scheming and plotting (and also gave the movie its title, from operation ""Walkure"").<br/><br/>Cruise does well, but his supporting cast is outstanding, including numerous ex-Pirates: Gibbs, Beckett, Mercer, even Davy Jones all show up. They looked a lot more colorful in pirate garb than in Nazi gray and green, though.<br/><br/>Still, while the movie does provide an excellent education in the assassination plot and the situation in Germany in mid-1944, it leaves us with little to hold on to. The key men all were martyred and paid with their lives, yet as the movie presents things, they accomplished next to nothing. Somewhere else I read that as a result of this plot, Hitler became even more reclusive and distrustful of his inner circle, which led to him taking less advice from capable generals and making more military mistakes. So ultimately this point could have been made somehow, but it wasn't.<br/><br/>Worth seeing by all means, but no big loss by waiting for the DVD rental."
"zooeyhall","9","7","11","29 December 2008"," very well done and meticulous re-creation of events
","I just came out of watching this movie five minutes ago, and wanted to jot down some quick notes on my immediate impression of the film.<br/><br/>This is an excellent portrayal of the events leading up to an including the attempted assassination of Hitler in the summer of 1944.<br/><br/>For those viewers who are interested in the history of WWII, they will find that this has been a meticulous re-creation of events. Too often, these types of movies--for the sake of ""dramatization""--obscure, ignore, or outright distort the historical record. There is very little, if any, of that here.<br/><br/>I suspect the screenwriters closely followed the history of this as depicted by William Shirer in his excellent ""Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"".<br/><br/>Too often this event has been relegated to a footnote of history. One of the things the movie tries to impress on the viewer is the incredible courage of the conspiracy members. I have read some reviews where the reviewers whine about the ""darkness"" of the movie. But it must be remembered that the conspirators knew that this was a desperate attempt to save Germany and stop World War II, and that there was only a slight chance of success. It is to the credit of the German Resistance Movement---too often dismissed by historians and even FDR himself--that they realized the evil of Hitler and tried to do something about it.<br/><br/>Cruise is quite good as Stauffenberg, and the British actors do an excellent job depicting the German co-conspirators.<br/><br/>I would urge others to see this movie, and especially young people. The movie has not only a historical lesson to teach, but a lesson in morality and courage in the face of tyranny. It is a lesson still pertinent today.<br/><br/>We also need to show Hollywood that there is a demand for good weighty movies such as this, and not only for the escapist mind-candy that so often appears at your local cinemaplex."

","I wonder if in the history of cinema there has ever been such woeful miscasting. The British contingent - Nighy, Stamp, Branagh and even Eddy Izzard, for Pete's sake - were so stiff upper lip it was a little tough for me to keep a grip on the fact they were meant to be German officers and not British officer POWs in a German stalag, accents apart. Many critics have incidentally criticized the latter in this film but there really is no choice unless we revert to the bad old Hollywood days of evil-sounding ""you English pigdog, ve haff vays off making you talk!"" Nazi accents or make the film in German with subtitles, which is inconceivable in a Hollywood crowd puller such as this. <br/><br/>But the ever young-looking Tom Cruise as Stauffenberg?! Now that's just silly. Every time I saw him I had to stifle a giggle, especially when he popped that daft glass eye in. Forget the fact that he can't act for toffee. <br/><br/>It's a pity that such a heroic and tragic tale had to be reduced to this. The Nazis foul revenge was only glossed over at the end, well, Tom was lying there dead, wasn't he, so that was that. <br/><br/>But for other reviewers to even mention this film in the same breath as the masterly Downfall is laughable. This story could have done with similar treatment and then it might have been a serious piece of cinema."
"alerter","6","24","50","19 December 2008"," a surprising Cruise snoozer, despite the big decibels...
","After phonetically memorizing a handful of lines of opening dialog in Deutsch, Tom Cruise gets to Vulcan mind-meld with the audience in California English for the rest of the film. (To be fair, the whole ensemble's accented English was all over the map, literally, according to each actor's native tongue. This soon comes to have a net numbing effect on the audience.) <br/><br/>It seems they really permed Cruise's hair, too. (Somewhat vain that Cruise initially took such a strong interest in von Stauffenberg primarily because Cruise thought their faces, in profile, are similar. A victory of form over content or just one ""method"" borrowed from the Color of Money?) <br/><br/>The film fails to make it sufficiently clear that previous *suicide-assassination* attempts against Hitler had failed, and that von Stauffenberg was not only required (by sheer necessity) to be The One to bomb Hitler, von Stauffenberg was also the one main charismatic personality who had any chance of convincing/*conning* non-conspirator Wehrmacht commanders (who outranked him) to go along with the coup, *after* the bomb had gone off. This is presented with a few too many touches of Mission Impossible and Jerry McGuire rolled into one lump. (I overheard someone asking why a *truck bomb* wasn't used. I suppose there wasn't enough Mission Impossible for that one.) <br/><br/>The film raises plausible questions about how the attempted coup might have succeeded, if *all* of the conspirators had von Stauffenberg's relentless and steely resolve (and/or just a little more luck). Some artistic license is taken, but it mostly boils down to one too many chicken poops ruining von Stauffenberg's intricate broth. (Not everyone, who would be necessary for success, was sufficiently determined to stop Hitler at all costs.) The film argues that despite Hitler's surviving the assassination attempt, swift and decisive conspirator action, according to timetable, might have neutralized the Gestapo, SS, SD and Hitler's inner circle for the coup to have succeeded anyway. This is both plausible and debatable. <br/><br/>This film is not a complete disappointment (it strives to cleave closely to known historical fact, given that most of the principals were executed or committed suicide and hence could not write confessions, let alone memoirs), but it is not nearly as good as some others make it out to be. The supporting cast does a commendable job, but cannot fill the gaping holes at the core of the film. The director and producers are entirely at fault. My 6.4 out of 10 is rounded down to 6. <br/><br/>How entertaining would any *procedural* ""caper"" flick (like MI1-2-3) be, if everyone on the team nailed their marks and the gambit *fails* anyway? Well, in real life, this clockwork gets botched and all winds up for naught. There was some hint of political intrigue in the film, but zero ""psychological"" drama. More of either or both would have helped. Where The Curious Case of Benjamin Button didn't seem nearly as long as *three hours*, Valkyrie felt like it was much, much longer than its actual two. <br/><br/>It's always a very bad sign that a film has lost its audience, when several people are snoring more loudly than the surround-sound, shake-you-in-your-seat crescendos that are liberally sprinkled along the course of the story. Some of the sleepers didn't awaken even for these rumblesome moments. <br/><br/>My bet is that, this season, Defiance will be the more revealing and more moving WWII story ""based on true events."" (Far fewer people already know about the amazingly heroic, yet internally conflicted, Bielski otriad.) Defiance's success will not be a matter of accents."

It was also a smaller project for Bryan Singer after doing 3 superhero films and reunite Singer and Christoper McQuarrie for the first time after the Usual Suspects.<br/><br/>Valkyrie starts with a prelogue sequence in North Africa. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a disaffected officer who is questioning Hitler's regime and that he was leading Germany to the path of destruction. During a British air raid he is injured badly, loosing an eye, his right hand and two fingers on his left hand. He can no longer serve on the front line. In 1943 General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) fails in his attempt to assassin Hitler and the German Resistance loss an army officer to help with operations. Von Stauffenberg is recruited in the resistance and the General Staff. He comes up with the Valkyrie plan which was to make the assassination of Hitler look like an SS plot, and get the army to launch a coup to 'protect' the Nazi regime. Von Stauffenberg is the only man who could get close to Hitler because he was the Chief-of-Staff for the Reserve Army General. The film is split into three major parts, the planning, the assassination attempt and the attempted coup.<br/><br/>Singer was able to bring in a very stylist approach of direction. I enjoy Singer's films and he was able to show his skills again. He is able to get an excellent cast, including Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Terrence Stamp and Tom Wilkingson to name a few. However, he shot the film in the style of a thriller, which was interesting, but being a historical film with most people knowing the outcome already takes away the suspense.

","Great production values, historical accuracy, and fine acting can be found in ""Valkyrie,"" a 2008 film starring Tom Cruise, Terrance Stamp, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, and Eddie Izzard. Tom Cruise played Claus von Stauffenberg, and one of the actors in a small role is actually von Stauffenberg's grandson. In the movie, Claus' wife Nina (Carice von Houten) is pregnant with the actor's mother.<br/><br/>There's no point in going through the story - it was one of something like 15 plots to assassinate Hitler, and the third try for von Stauffenberg,a man from a well-known family and a strict Catholic who never became a member of the Nazi party.<br/><br/>Two points, both referenced in a review on this site. The reviewer who wrote that kids walked out of the movie saying they were surprised by it because they thought Hitler was going to die - shame on their teachers. It reminds me of the review of ""13 Days"" on this site that said the Kenny O'Donnell character, one of Kennedy's most important advisors, played by Kevin Costner, was fictional. Right, and they used White House transcripts and just stuck him in there. It is awful, I agree.<br/><br/>The second point, referenced by the same reviewer and undoubtedly by others, was about the accents. I'm going to disagree on that point, though I get what he was saying - everyone should have been British or American, not some of both.<br/><br/>The acting rule is, when people are in their native country, such as Germans in Germany, it's assumed they're speaking their own language, not English with an accent. Therefore, one doesn't need an accent. As far as having both Brits and Americans in the cast, I refer you to ""Das Boot"" which was in German, but some of the actors were from Austria, some of them were from varying parts of Germany - in short, lots of dialects. So to have people speaking English in a movie where there are different accents is really quite realistic.<br/><br/>Though, if you know anything at all about history, you know how this movie ends, it's still very suspenseful. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise - I find his acting very external most of the time - but he does okay, he isn't afraid to surround himself with excellent people, and his makeup is perfect. I thought the film looked authentic (though black and white is always better for films set in the '40s), and, from what I've read, historically right on, including the big scene where von Stauffenberg puts his plan in motion.<br/><br/>Someone else commented that Americans can't understand the enormity of what von Stauffenberg was planning, and therefore, the film doesn't work, but again, I disagree. As a viewer, I certainly felt the terror and the enormity of the plan. One had to be really desperate to agree to it. And plenty of Germans were."

Camera-work by Newton Thomas Sigel is simply astounding, background score is spell-bounding and superb production value.

The story, however, seemed to be a fairly accurate historical account of the events on which the movie is based. That I commend, although there really wasn't a convincing romantic element or memorable musical score that I think could have greatly added to the underlying story. I believe the movie could have been made ten times better by using a cast of unknowns, who at least were German.

I mean you would think that with almost everyone else in the movie having a German accent (almost not everyone did) that he would maybe extend his acting abilities and try to enhance his character by playing it with a German accent. Oh well you can't have it all...<br/><br/>It is also a very educational film that encompasses many aspects of life that a soldier serving in the German army during WWII may have.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie that I would recommend to anyone who likes a good movie even the non history buff types.

","This film is a tribute to a group of unlikely heroes determined to end the tyranny of Adolph Hitlers Nazi regime at all cost, and in the end they paid the ultimate price. This is a story that 90% of the world knows little to nothing about but is a story of such great importance to the eventual outcome of World War II that to forget it would be akin to forgetting the events of Iwo Jima or D-Day. From that point on, Hitler was a paranoid wreck and the already shaky foundation of his psyche had been dealt a crushing blow when several of his most trusted allies plotted to end his life. This led to a decline in the strategic efficiency of the Nazi military and to a sense of distrust amongst the ranks of the Nazi hierarchy.<br/><br/>The movie itself is presented beautifully with strong direction by Bryan Singer. Tom Cruise pulls off the role of Colonel Von Stauffennberg marvelously and much to my surprise he played the character off with much feeling and emotion.<br/><br/>This is a definite must see for not just WWII buffs but for the everyday moviegoer as well."

","Valkyrie (2008) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Highly flawed but entertaining drama centered around Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and other high ranked German officials who try to hatch a plot to kill Hitler. This is a rather strange movie to get into because for the first hour I was rolling my eyes at a lot of the stuff going on but once the day of the assassination attempt went into effect the movie picked up a lot of steam and for that final hour I found myself caught up in the story and entertained. I think a better movie could be made of the subject but in the end I think the producers were just trying to capture a popcorn movie and on that level they succeeded. I think one of the biggest flaws are the English and British accents being used for the German characters. I understand they couldn't have the actors speaking in German as that would have killed the box office returns here but there's really no excuse to not having German accents. This is especially true for Hitler who just comes off rather nerdy here instead of the terrifying figure he really is. I couldn't help but roll my eyes a few times when he was speaking because it just didn't have that flair that comes from what we're use to seeing from him. The message of the film, and those doing the mission, was to inform people that not every German was a follower of Hitler. That's loud and clear but I must admit that the plot seems to have been watered down or sugar coated because the film plays the assassination plot rather simple because there's never a problem getting close to the main and everyone involved speaks openly about their mission. With all of that said, the final hour contains some nice suspense considering we know how the film ends. It also pays nice respect to the men risking their lives to try and end the tortures being brought by Hitler. The look of the film is very realistic but I will say the English accents sometimes take away from the authenticity. The performances are all decent with the exception of Cruise who just doesn't fit this role. Cruise is one of my favorite actors but I had a very hard time believing him in this role even though it was clear he was giving it his all. Kenneth Branagh and Tom Wilkinson offer up good performances in their few scenes. In the end I think it's best not to take this film overly serious and instead just sit back, have some popcorn and enjoy the story. There are a lot of flaws with the film but I guess that should have been expected considering what the producers were aiming for."

Just about every criticism they made about this movie missed the mark by a country mile. To say that a historical movie cannot build suspense because the eventual outcome is known (a criticism leveled by IFC's Matt Singer) seem almost too stupid for a layman critic to utter, let alone a supposed professional. I found myself wringing my hands several times in this movie, waiting for the heartbreaking events to unfold. I have also heard many critics raving about how poor Tom Cruises performance was...once again, far from reality. I usually maintain that tastes vary, and such variances account for some of the negative reviews, but there are so many off the mark statements being made about this movie, that I wonder if there isn't some hidden agenda at work here, an anti-Cruise bias if you will.

If I were to be bold enough to weigh in with my opinion I'd say all those involved should feel proud of their work. I won't say lightning struck again because, honestly, I was never that impressed by The Usual Suspects, it's good, but without the ending it wouldn't necessarily even approach great. Much are my thoughts on this historical wartime opusit tells a very intriguing story with the right amounts of action, espionage, and heroism, however, I don't see it as anything spectacular. It's a very well done film and it can be applauded for that fact.<br/><br/>Valkyrie was set up to be the studio's tent-pole attraction, announcing the return of a movie-house. Unfortunately, after being pushed back a complete year, the release has become somewhat lackluster, a huge albatross of whether the backers didn't feel it would succeed then making us wonder if it will now. With some big names attached behind and in front of the camera, many believed this would be a contender for end of year awards. I don't think that will be the case. Solid yet unspectacular creates a piece that is worth seeing and recommending, but not an award-winning masterpiece. Singer does do a lot right, though, hopefully showing that he can branch out and distance himself from X-Men and Superman Returns to bring the humanity and character evolution that worked so well with his two mutant stories into a world grounded in reality.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this film is made to showcase the actors while trying to educate the public about these superheroes in their own way, some heroics from a country and time that saw only murder and hatred. While this fact is what I enjoyed about it, it is also what may cause some of its lackluster sheen. Knowing, (I hope I'm ruining nothing here and people realize that Hitler committed suicide when the Allies surrounded Berlin), that the attempt to kill and overthrow the Nazi regime fails, makes the first half exposition drag. One wants to see how the plan falls apart, not how it was shaped and put into motion. Let me correct myself, you do want to know these details, how these men banded together, how they duped Der Führer, it's just the anticipation to watch the plan go into effect that dulls the factual history from being as interesting as it should be. Once the day finally arrives to prove their worth, the tension and pace tighten up and drive steadily to the end, keeping you riveted as each step advances.<br/><br/>I won't go into detail about the plans, which are the beauty of the operation; the ideas and execution of them are what keeps your interest. It is a pretty airtight mission, but as General Beck states, it's a military operation, they never go right. No one can ever anticipate what might happenvenue changes, a person's kindness to help carry something, the brief second-guessing of a man sacrificing precious seconds. One can never practice anything to perfection because life just isn't that exact. But therein lies the heart of this story, that there are people who dare to stand against the norm to fight for what is right. Despite their oath to Hitler, these men and women put their feet down and risk it all for the citizens, for their country. It was never about them, it was always about Germany.<br/><br/>The one thing I feared was the fact that everyone spoke with their natural accents, no one made anyone attempt a horrid German tongue to possibly distract and distance us from the reality. While there is something to be said about realism, if handled right, there can be exceptions. Bryan Singer deftly maneuvers his way into the English translation by beginning in German and slowing superimposing our language atop the vocal track. It's a subtle trick that helps make us believe we have been brought into a state of translation; the characters are speaking German yet we can understand them. This also helps in allowing the actors to give it their all, without the clunky self-consciousness that follows speaking out of one's native speech patterns. I believe Tom Cruise does a wonderfully solid job as von Stauffenberg and the rest of the cast follows suit. The two that impressed me most, however, were Christian Berkel as von Quirnheim and Bill Nighy's Olbricht. Nighy exudes the inner conflict and struggle of humanity throughout the film, questioning everything and wanting to be absolutely sure of each step. When the time was right, though, he was able to compose himself and do his job, because deep down he knew he was doing what he believed in.<br/><br/>Kudos to all involved for making this story and opening my eyes to it, as I'm sure it will for many others too. Everyone brings their A-game, it's all just too much a non-fiction film for me, stating the facts without surprise, lecturing rather than digging into our souls and touching us. The ending is magnificent, don't get me wrong, it shows the strength of character these ""traitors"" had and it instills a legacy of heroism that they deserve. The journey to that point may be a little too paint-by-numbers for my liking."

","This movie was truly awful.<br/><br/>The pacing was slow; so much so I went and did the dishes at one stage.<br/><br/>The choice for the actors - some of them very fine indeed - to not don German accents (or at least a more uniform set of accents) - was an odd and off-putting one indeed.<br/><br/>Cruise's performance was per functionary and emotionless, and although the movie tried to give a sense of the motivations and meanings of the historical characters it failed miserably. I get that the directors wanted to leave some ambiguity there - after all who truly knows what drives a person to a particular act? But the ambiguity led to the film being nothing more than a series of events with no depth or insight. Poor directing.<br/><br/>Don't bother with it - read the historical accounts instead."

","The very high profile cast of this film notwithstanding, I'm afraid that ""Valkyrie"" has all the gravitas of a made-for-TV movie. How some of the top names in British and continental cinema got roped into accepting parts in this film I will never understand - unless it was a matter of money, of course. Especially disappointing is the practically non-existent parts for actresses Carice van Houten and Halina Reijn. What a waste of two talented actresses. And as for the actor who played Hitler, all I can say is that after the phenomenal performance of Austrian Actor Bruno Ganz as Hitler in the film ""The Downfall"" no other actor should ever be allowed to play the Fuhrer.<br/><br/>The plot of the film certainly has some large holes in it, too. The very idea that German Army colonels were ordering around various German generals seems pretty far fetched.<br/><br/>Finally, of course, there's Tom Cruise playing Colonel Stauffenberg. Cruise brings nothing special to the role. If the makers of this movie were at all serious in the subject matter they should have chosen a different actor to play the role. Cruise is just too lightweight to carry off such an important role.<br/><br/>The highlights of the film were the tri-motor aircraft at the beginning, and the very good musical score played at the ending credits. Everything in between was neither here nor there."

","""Valkyrie"" tells the story of the July 20th plot, the attempt by a group of German military officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler, to overthrow the Nazi regime and to bring an end to World War II. The title refers to Operation Valkyrie, which was originally a contingency plan by the Nazis to use the ""Ersatzheer"", or Reserve Army, to put down any civil unrest in Berlin. The plotters came up with the audacious idea of using this plan to further their own aims; after Hitler's death they would announce that he had been murdered by radical elements in the SS who intended to seize power for themselves, and would put ""Operation Valkyrie"" into effect to thwart this supposed conspiracy, ordering the Reserve Army to arrest SS and Party members. In other words, soldiers loyal to Hitler would be tricked into carrying out an anti-Nazi coup in the belief that they were suppressing an anti-Nazi coup.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as Claus Von Stauffenberg. Von Stauffenberg, who only held the rank of Colonel, was not the actual leader of the German Resistance- that was General Ludwig Beck, who would have become President of Germany had the plot succeeded. Indeed, Von Stauffenberg was a late recruit to the movement, which he did not join until 1943. Nevertheless, he quickly became a key member; he was the man who had the idea of using the ""Valkyrie"" plans to overthrow Nazi rule and the man who was to carry out the assassination attempt on Hitler.<br/><br/>Historians have debated the motives of Von Stauffenberg and the other conspirators, but in this film he is depicted as a hero, a man disgusted by Nazi atrocities and by the way in which Hitler had dragged Germany into a brutal war of conquest and destruction. Cruise's casting caused some controversy, partly because of his adherence to the Church of Scientology, but also because some doubted whether he was the right actor to play a German national hero. I think that here those doubts are laid to rest. Cruise can at times be a twitchy, hyperactive actor, but here (as in ""Eyes Wide Shut"") his acting is much more calm and restrained; Von Stauffenberg emerges as a figure of true moral stature as well as unquestioned courage. To my mind this is Cruise's best film to date, better than ""Rain Man"" or ""A Few Good Men"", better even than ""Eyes Wide Shut"".<br/><br/>Many of the other leading roles are taken by British actors. Kenneth Branagh plays General Henning Von Tresckow, the man who recruited Von Stauffenberg into the movement and who made an earlier, unsuccessful, attempt to kill Hitler by planting a bomb on board his aircraft. Bill Nighy portrays General Friedrich Olbricht, shown here as decent and honourable man, but fatally indecisive; he delays putting ""Valkyrie"" into operation by several hours while waiting for official confirmation of Hitler's death, a delay that damaged the conspiracy's chance of success. Tom Wilkinson plays the treacherous General Friedrich Fromm who attempted to run with both sides; although he knew about the conspiracy in advance he refused to join it on July 20, claiming to be loyal to the Nazi regime. Fromm's treachery was to do him no good; he was eventually executed as a traitor for failing to disclose the plot to the authorities.<br/><br/>In form the film is a political thriller, which might be thought to prompt one vital question: how can one make a thriller about a real-life event, the outcome of which will already be known to the audience? We all know, of course, that Hitler survived the attempt on his life, that the plot to overthrow the Nazis ended in failure and that the war in Europe was to drag on for nearly another year, at a cost of millions more lives. The answer is that most thrillers, even those based on fictional stories, are highly predictable; we generally know that the good guys will win and the bad guys will get their come-uppance, but that does not necessarily spoil our enjoyment. So it is with ""Valkyrie"", except that this is a thriller where we know that, ultimately, the bad guys will win. Nevertheless, director Bryan Singer is able to create so much tension that there actually comes a point where we can almost believe that Von Stauffenberg and his colleagues will win, that what thought we knew about history is mistaken and that the war in Europe really did end in 1944 after the Nazi regime was overthrown in a coup.<br/><br/>This film is something of a departure for Singer; I previously knew him best as the director of ""The Usual Suspects"" and of superhero movies such as ""Superman Returns"" and the X-Men franchise. Nevertheless, his move into historical drama has been a highly successful one. In my view ""Valkyrie"" must be one of the best films of 2008. It combines superb acting with a tense, thrilling plot, an intelligent script, a moral theme and an unforgettable portrayal of true heroism. I am surprised that it has not received any Oscar nominations, unlike that other (and in my opinion greatly inferior) Nazi-themed drama ""The Reader"". It should be required viewing for the regrettably large number of Britons who still persist in believing that all wartime Germans were Nazi fanatics. 10/10"

","Valkyrie is the latest film from director Bryan Singer, after many delays the film has finally been released, and I must say that it was definitely worth the wait.<br/><br/>The film is about the assassination plot against Hitler, formulated by military officials. The leader of this plot was Col. Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise). These officials knowingly committed treason in hopes of successfully killing Hitler.<br/><br/>The film was superbly directed by Bryan Singer, who re-enforces himself once more as one of the film industries greatest living filmmakers. As well the script by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander was terrific. Of course the true highlight of the film was the amazing acting. The cast, ranging from Kenneth Brannagh to Tom Cruise himself, was stellar. It almost seemed as if every single character actor in the film industry was cast in this movie.<br/><br/>While some have given this film flack for the simple fact that you pretty much know the ending before the film even starts, the film still manages to be a tense and highly entertaining thriller that not only will keep the audience on the edge of their seat, but also the ending will evoke a deep emotional response from the very same audience.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is Bryan Singer back in true form. It is easily one of the best films I have seen in a long time, and I am greatly looking forward to seeing this film over and over again.<br/><br/>I give Valkyrie a perfect 10 out of 10!"

","This film is being falsely advertised, but not too false. Based upon a true attempt to kill Adolf Hitler and using the names of the real people who tried, the second half of the film is total fiction & the plan is fiction as well.<br/><br/>Even though it is framed so well by the writers, reality gets left behind after the explosion attempt. The group that Col Stausser headed in the attempt to kill Hitler really did not have an exact plan what to do if they were successful. That is what makes the second half of the film and especially the scene with the attempted arrest of Henrich Himmler total fiction as this never happened.<br/><br/>What really is missing is the prime motivation for why the group was trying to kill Hitler. The true historic motivation for this group was nothing to do with freedom from Hitler. While they wanted to kill Hitler, their goal was to bring back the Kaiser. They were hoping that by restoring the German Monarchy, they could end the war before Germany was destroyed by the evil madman.<br/><br/>The film depicts the group as nearly pulling off this military coup and this did not happen. Every German knew about Hitlers plans for slaughtering Jews from Mein Kamp. Jews had a bad time in Europe when the war started as Stalin was sending them to death camps in Siberia just as quickly as Hitler was.<br/><br/>The only things the film can get credit for is looking authentic while the mix of English, American & German accents get mixed, and correctly pointing out that the day of the bombing in the Wolfs Lair, that El Duce (Benito Musselini), deposed Italian was there. It also points out correctly at the end of the movie who gets shot for the high crimes.<br/><br/>The suspense music seems to repeat itself a lot in the film, too often.

","If the plot to assassinate Hitler in the summer of 1944 had gone off as planned, you can be sure some enterprising studio mogul at the time would have made a film about the incident even before the ink on the ensuing peace treaty had had a chance to dry. But as the effort did, in fact, fail, we've had to wait more than sixty years for this particular piece of World War II history to find its way onto the silver screen. Well, better late than never, I always say.<br/><br/>In ""Valkyrie,"" Tom Cruise plays Claus von Stauffenberg, a battle-scarred corporal in the German army, who helps to spearhead the conspiracy to bring Hitler's worldwide reign of terror to an abortive end. Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander had really two basic options to choose from in approaching this material: either treat it as a thoughtful character study, probing deep into the psyches of the men involved, or handle it as a straight-ahead action picture, emphasizing the minutiae and the step-by-step process of the plan itself. In choosing the latter, the filmmakers have made a movie that is interesting on a superficial level (and certainly informative as a re-enactment of a fascinating event in history), but not nearly as memorable or compelling as it might have been had they chosen the former.<br/><br/>As director, Bryan Singer keeps things moving along at a fairly fast clip, even though the profusion of characters all dressed in similar uniforms sometimes makes it hard to tell who exactly everyone is and which side of the Fuhrer dividing-line each happens to fall out on. In fact, at times, the people who are involved in the conspiracy actually seem to outnumber those who know nothing about it. Moreover, Cruise's generally wooden performance prevents us from delving very deeply into the inner workings of the man he is portraying. In addition, Kenneth Branagh and Terrance Stamp are given too little screen time to register much of an impact in their roles as fellow conspirators.<br/><br/>Still, it's impossible not to be moved and inspired by the tremendous bravery and heroism demonstrated by these men or by the incredible personal sacrifices they were willing to make to do what they knew was right. Of course, ""Valkyrie"" comes with the same built-in limitation as ""Titanic"" - which is that we know even before we enter the theater how the story itself will turn out. It's a tribute, therefore, to Singer's skill as a director that he still manages to generate as much genuine suspense as he does with the material.<br/><br/>""Valkyrie"" succeeds more, perhaps, as a history lesson than as a stark human drama, but what an eye-opening lesson it turns out to be."

","Even Bryan Singer's near misses, like APT PUPIL (which punked out in the end, for understandable reasons) and SUPERMAN RETURNS (a needless remake of a needless movie, with more lapses of logic than a Michael Bey movie), are beautifully crafted. So is VALKYRIE. Unlike the two aforementioned movies, the latter also boasts (like THE USUAL SUSPECTS and the first two X-MEN movies) superior writing and outstanding performances all around. I must confess I rarely read posts by others on the IMDb, but I came across one at random that sought to point out (needlessly) that the man portrayed by Tom Cruise was a Nazi and an anti-Semite. What was the tip-off- the Nazi uniform? While an examination of such a man's mind-set might (or might not) be interesting, VALKYRIE is about a coup attempt against the twentieth century's greatest mass murderer. It's a suspenseful story, told as well as can be told, and is chock full of small but memorable moments. For me, the most memorable has to be the scene where the Cruise character, missing his right hand, is ordered to salute a superior. Just one moment among many. Highly recommended- or, as one of the characters puts it: ""You should hear what they have to say."""

However I think for the sake of originality the film should have been entirely in German. I know it can be difficult but for a well paid and famous actor such as Tom Cruise an effort to learn his lines in German should not be such a big deal.

","The new Tom Cruise movie ""Valkyrie,"" a dutiful but dreary reenactment of the 20th July 1944, Hitler bomb plot is no blast. Clocking in at a tedious two hours, this military procedural potboiler about the last of 15 flawed efforts to assassinate Adolf Hitler displays immaculate production values and a first-class cast. Nevertheless, ""Superman Returns"" director Bryan Singer serves up no thrills or chills. Further, ""Valkyrie"" provides no surprises or suspense, primarily because we know already that the pusillanimous generals botched the bomb plot. <br/><br/>Mind you, ""Valkyrie"" isn't the first movie about the fateful events leading up to another bungled German Army High Command conspiracy to kill Hitler and salvage the Third Reich. The Germans themselves produced an award-winning, made-for-TV movie ""Stauffenberg"" about the Hitler bomb attempt in 2004. Previously, CBS-TV aired ""The Plot to Kill Hitler"" with ""Midnight Express"" star Brad Davis playing Colonel von Stauffenberg in 1990. The bomb plot played a peripheral role in the Richard Burton World War II film ""Breakthrough"" (1978) with Robert Mitchum. The classic Peter O'Toole World War II thriller ""The Night of the Generals"" (1967) contained a subplot about von Stauffenberg's fiasco. Earlier, back in 1955, West German filmmakers unveiled the first theatrical version of the same events entitled ""The Plot to Assassinate Hitler"" with Wolfgang Priess starring as von Stauffenberg. Even if World War II film fanatics haven't heard of Priess, they have seen him in several W.W. II films, notably ""The Longest Day,"" ""A Bridge Too Far,"" ""Raid on Rommel,"" and ""Von Ryan's Express."" <br/><br/>""Valkyrie"" opens in Tunisia, North Africa 1943, with the German Army's 10th Panzer Division in the desert. Colonel von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) writes in his diary about his determination to kill Hitler and save lives. Later, he speaks with a Wehrmacht officer general who resembles Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, but this officer (Bernard Hill of ""Titanic"") clearly isn't the legendary Desert Fox. Moments later, British fighter planes swoop down to strafe and bomb the Germans. Explosions kill the Rommel looking general while von Stauffenberg loses his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand. Miscast as he is, Tom Cruise earns some credit for playing a radically different type of hero than he usually plays. However, the top-notch British and German actors who surround him blow him off the screen with their heavyweight performances. Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and even comedian Eddie Izzard upstage him at every turn.<br/><br/>After von Stauffenberg recovers from his wounds, he joins the general staff of General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy of ""Underworld"") and fellow conspirators Major-General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh of ""Henry V"") and General Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp of ""Yes Man"") tap him to devise a better plan to kill Hitler. Ironically, von Stauffenberg concocts a new plan when he is reunited with his family on holiday. His children spin a copy of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"" on their turntable. Allied bombers break up the reunion and the needle skips off the 78 RPM record. As he huddles in an air raid shelter, von Stauffenberg hears the tone arm skip back to play the Wagner opera and his eyes glitter. The generals approve of von Stauffenberg's plan to mobilize Hitler's reserve army--codenamed 'Valkyrie'--to help them take control of the Third Reich after they have killed the dastardly dictator. Our hero sets about the task of recruiting more members for the conspiracy and devising an explosive charge that will kill Hitler. Unfortunately, von Stauffenberg begins to see why all previous assassinate attempts failed. The political and military titans of the conspiracy lack conviction and quarrel about petty details. The indecision on the part of these conspirators and von Stauffenberg's own crusade to kill the little corporal seal their doom and safeguard Hitler.<br/><br/>Technically, while ""Valkyrie"" is correct in every respect with regard to history, Singer and writers Christopher McQuarrie of ""The Usual Suspects"" and newcomer Nathan Alexander have made a thriller than generates monotony more often than momentum. ""Valkyrie"" plays out in rooms and on roads. We watch German officers get out of either planes or cars, march into buildings, enter rooms, and talk, talk, talk. Afterward, we watch these same officers exit rooms, walk out of buildings, get into either cars or planes, and head off to other interiors where they babble some more. Incredibly, there are only two quotable lines in the entire movie! Singer and company provide a few scenes between our hero and his wife, but each lacks intimacy because they are either disrupted by a bombing raid or music drowns out their dialogue.<br/><br/>Worse, Adolf Hitler (David Bamber of ""The Bourne Identity"") spends most of his time on screen puttering about in a daze. Why would any filmmaker trot out the most heinous villain of 20th century history and reduce him to a simpering sad sack? Indeed, ""Valkyrie"" arouses more sympathy for Hitler than the people who proved themselves too incompetent to eliminate him. Ultimately, ""Valkyrie"" isn't so much a tragedy of errors as it is a humdrum movie about a conspiracy of well-meaning imbeciles who wanted to strike a bargain with the Allies before the Allied armies trampled the Fatherland. Anybody who knows their history knows about the newsreel footage of der Fuehrer stomping happily about after the debacle of the bomb attempt. Hitler is never shown performing this shtick.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, avoid ""Valkyrie!"""

According to the movie, he is the one who get the reserve army idea, he is the one who persuaded all the other members, and he even became the commander of the whole thing at the end...<br/><br/>First of all,I don't believe a colonel can maneuver a bunch of generals in 40s' Germany.<br/><br/>Secondly,if Stauffenberg was the key man of the plot, then I must say it's the stupidest plot ever: what if something went wrong and Stauffenberg dead at the Wolf Lair? The Queen never go to some pacific island to hunt evil scientist, she let Bond do it.<br/><br/>I'm not a WWII specialist, if all these things really happened in real history, then I will give Mr. Hitler some credits for kicking all these generals into reserve army. These guys answers to a colonel and unable to set up a reasonable assassin plan, how could them be useful on the Eastern front?"
"pefrss","1","18","43","8 January 2009"," Cruise does not convince as a German aristocrat or officer
","I was talked into watching this movie and unfortunately I sat through it. Of all the movies I have ever seen about WWII, this one was the least convincing. None of the actors gave me the impression of being German. And Cruise as Stauffenberg was completely unconvincing as a German aristocrat of that time. I had seen the Reader before I saw Valkyrie and though I regretted that they chose non-German actors too, I very much enjoyed that movie and found it a good representation of the time and people I grew up with. <br/><br/>I have a hard time understanding how anybody could find this movie interesting, I thought it was boring from the beginning to the end."
"Doylenf","7","6","11","27 December 2008"," Taut thriller in the WWII vein about a failed plot to kill Hitler...
","VALKYRIE accomplishes the mission it sets out to perform within a two hour running time. Under Bryan Singer's direction, it's a taut thriller bearing the outlines of a true story, handling a complex military plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler that depends on split-second timing to succeed. As we all know, it almost works. It's the ""almost"" factor that gives the film a gripping edge, even though we know the plot fails. The complete story of the events is pared down to make a concise thriller that wastes not a second of screen time.<br/><br/>As Colonel Von Stauffenberg, TOM CRUISE gives an effective performance, given that no more of his background is known or explained fully. He delivers a crisp, tight, forceful performance, bolstered by the fact that others around him do equally convincing jobs. BILL NIGHY, TERENCE STAMP, KENNETH BRANAGH, TOM WILKINSON, THOMAS KRETSCHMANN--these are the most prominent and all of them are splendid in portraying Nazi officers who recognize that Hitler's Germany is not the one they envision for the world, intent on seeing Hitler's Germany crushed and given new leadership.<br/><br/>Photographed on many of the actual location sites in Germany, it's a vivid recreation of the period with excellent use of sets, costumes and explosives. All of the shattering wartime explosions are extremely well crafted, as is the bomb that almost destroys Hitler's conference room.<br/><br/>The pulsating music score gives the film a solid amount of suspense once the plan is underway. This forces the first half of the film to be largely exposition, but none of the exposition is dull. It sets up the story to follow in an intelligent way.<br/><br/>The New York Times movie critic dismissed the film's values and referred to Cruise as ""too much Tom Cruise"" to be believable in the role. Not true. It's much more serious than that, and the film's tone is totally unlike the style of many of the war movies of the '40s--""Desperate Journey,"" for example, featuring the antics of the Warner contract players in a film starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan about putting one over on the Nazis, which was juvenile nonsense.<br/><br/>It's intelligent and engrossing from beginning to end, an efficient WWII yarn based on true incidents that should be seen and appreciated for what it is--not for bashing Mr. Cruise and whatever tabloid headlines exploit his personal life. It might also inform some of today's teen-agers about an event that actually happened during WWII--at least those teens who are interested in the subject."
"raimund-berger","6","8","16","30 April 2009"," Nice attempt, but too simplistic character portrayal.
","In case you wonder why the film kind of leaves you cold, here's my guess: the protagonist, Stauffenberg, is lacking any inner conflict. As generally the characters Mr. Cruise plays seem to be in doubt max 5 mins of the respective film, from whence on they just try to do the right thing, against all odds, and either succeed or fail.<br/><br/>So to be perfectly clear, committing high treason - which this film is about - would not be something you once make a decision on and then just go forward without any further qualm. And especially not so when you were officer in the German army, each member of which was obliged to take an oath on the Fuehrer's person. Unfortunately, this major conflict just gets reflected in some of the co-conspirators, where it's generally portrayed as a weakness which Stauffenberg helps them to overcome.<br/><br/>Which, once again, leaves us with a one dimensional hero who fails mainly due to bad luck and lack of proper support from his surroundings. Sorry, but for me that just doesn't fly. For example, with that many attempts that were made on Hitler's life, one could wonder why not a single one succeeded. Maybe the perpetrators did, in the end, lack the determination. So that, as in this case, just one of two bombs would go off and thus not kill the dictator.<br/><br/>Such an angle, or any angle more differentiating, like showing us the assassin fighting himself, fighting against his trained code of honor and against all he has been taught, and maybe even losing against himself rather than bad luck would have made for a much more interesting drama. I guess that would have been too much to ask from Mr. Cruise anyway though.<br/><br/>So in the end, I give this film credits for being fair and sufficiently accurate. It's still kind of shallow.<br/><br/>While at it, for those interested in the actual events I can recommend the docudrama Operation Walküre by Franz Peter Wirth. Jolly good stuff and, to the mature audience, way more involving than this film, I'm sorry to say."
"roti-3","1","25","65","31 December 2008"," There is a much better dramatisation of this subject
","If I compare and analyse the 2008 Valküre with the 2004 Stauffenberg then I think Cruise and Co. lost their time and what is even worse my time. In my eyes, they created a worser film than existed before, which means they went back instead of making progress, which one can expect. <br/><br/>In the 2004 Stauffenberg, the leading actor Sebastian Koch portrays the character much more convincing for me than the self proclaimed scientologist. This 2008 specimen lacks depth and is too simplistic. I mean Americans get one year of history in high school, so most of the viewers will indeed be satisfied for what they ""learn"". If of course one is educated, one will be finding this film too Hollywoodean. This is why I think it is a waste of one's money to expect much from this piece."
"rbigalke-2","5","12","27","27 December 2008"," Eh
","What a waste of so many extraordinary talents! To have Tom Cruise and Kenneth Brannagh lend their talents to such a plodding and predictable plot is a travesty. We don't care about film characters just because of the historical events or the actors- we care about them because of who they are and what they do in the STORY! This is just a documentary with nothing other than the historical events to support it. And anybody with a rudimentary, or even sensationalist, knowledge of WWII history knows how it will end. There's no suspense! Fault the writer/director for becoming so enamored with the historical events. The death of the wife of one of the major players may have been an impetus for writing the story in the first place and be an explanation for the overly sentimental treatment of the events. The opening special effects are spectacular and prepare the audience for something much more substantial than what the film delivers. Give this a regrettable three (yes, THREE!) thumbs down."
"Jackpollins","1","13","30","14 August 2009"," Quite possibly the most boring movie ever
","First off, I would like to say in the thriller, Valkyrie, Tom Cruise is the worst casting decision in years. He is laughably bad, and makes it so the film is simply not thrilling. Second off, this is so, so, so boring. The whole cast just stand there looking bored. I think I saw some of the cast members looking at their watches to see when they can go home so they don't have to be bored anymore. This is the story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), a man determined on taking down Hitler. He has a trusty crew of army men by his side. As thrilling as this all sounds, it is extremely boring, and laughably bad. It's also extremely clichéd. Yet another Hitler's evil movie. We all know Hitler is evil, we don't need yet another movie to remind us of that. Tom Cruise should have been buried alive before taking this role, and yet, the one actor no one, and I mean no one takes seriously, they instead decide to cast as a man bent on taking down Hitler. This is not even mildly satisfying. There is nothing going on in here, it's just simply boring, nothing else."
"moviewizguy","6","9","19","26 December 2008"," Many saw evil. They dared to stop it.
","At the height of WW2, a group of high-ranking German officers hatched a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, and seize power of the military command in order to end the war. The operation was codenamed ""Valkyrie"", for the emergency plan that was meant to be used in case of a revolt against the Nazi government.<br/><br/>Let me get to the point: Don't let the trailer for the film fool you. Don't let the director fool you. Don't even let Tom Cruise fool you. What's being advertised as a nail-biting, suspenseful film, many people will be disappointed that ""Valkyrie"" is more like the opposite. It's not a bad film, honestly. I enjoyed it but when watching the film, get ready to hear a lot of coughing in the audience to break the silence throughout the film.<br/><br/>The movie is actually two separate films: The first half is actually the planning of Hitler's assassination. Due to the film being built upon this secret plan, none of the ""action"" really starts until the second half. That's where the problem lies. The first film is pretty...uneventful. The second half, although much more exciting and more things happening, is still not as ""action packed"" as you hope it to be.<br/><br/>I guess if you're a person who likes dialog to fill the screen for the first half and some action the second, you'll enjoy it. It's great, actually, because the film doesn't need mindless action to fill up the running time, which is partly the reason why I liked the film. However, if you want it like Bryan Singer's previous efforts, you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>I won't be surprised if the majority of the people find this film boring and too talky. I won't blame them for expecting something much more like shown in the trailer. However, it's based on a true story so you know the filmmakers were trying to keep it true, although maybe changing a few things for the silver screen. Tom Cruise does a decent job as Stauffenberg, the mastermind behind the plan, although not an Oscar worthy performance (that would go to his performance in ""Tropic Thunder,"" of course). Everyone else also do a decent job for what they have.<br/><br/>In the end, although not as big as the advertising make it out to be, along with the names on the movie, the film is, in my opinion, what I call, passable entertainment and important history for people to learn, if they hadn't known already. The film is more a psychological film than an action blockbuster starring Tom Cruise. Yes, I'll admit, it's Cruise and Singer's weaker efforts but you can't deny them for trying their best for what they have."
"Turfseer","5","14","33","4 January 2009"," Better off as a ""Made for TV"" movie
","First off, I agree with those critics who found Tom Cruise utilizing an American accent while the other actors are all speaking in polished British accents, a big mistake. The film's verisimilitude is compromised quite a bit by Cruise's inability to convince us that he's truly Klaus von Stauffenberg, a sophisticated Army officer from an aristocratic German family.<br/><br/>That said, Valkyrie wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. It's basically a by-the-numbers recreation of the last plot to kill Hitler. While it lacks suspense (since the film's climax is a forgone conclusion) it does ably depict who the players were and how they concocted and carried out the failed assassination plot.<br/><br/>Valkyrie fails in the area of character development. We never get to know any of these characters as multi-dimensional human beings. Director Bryan Singer chose to tell his story purely as an action-adventure movie. On the plus side, the movie looks like it was filmed at some of the actual locations especially the scenes shot at the ""Wolf's Lair"" which looked pretty realistic.<br/><br/>The most objectionable aspect of 'Valkyrie' is elevating von Stauffenberg to hero status. While certainly he was courageous, he was no hero. Had Germany been winning the war, it's not likely there would have been as many assassination attempts as there were. I find it difficult to believe that most of the conspirators were primarily motivated by a moral imperative.<br/><br/>Daniel Goldhagen, in his brilliant book ""Hitler's Willing Executioneers--Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust"", informs that von Stauffenberg's own brother admitted that in the sphere of internal politics, ""we had welcomed the basic tenets of National Socialism for the most part...The concept of race seemed sound and very promising."" Their objection was merely that its ""implementation was exaggerated and carried too far"". Stauffenberg's uncle, Count Uxkull, stated ""We should hold on to the concept of race as far as possible."" <br/><br/>According to Goldhagen, one of the central documents of the resistance to Hitler, prepared at the beginning of 1943 by leading Protestant theologians and university professors, explicitly condemned genocide but still argued that Jews caused trouble for Germany, that a ""Jewish Problem"" existed, that the Jews had harmed Germany and that a ""solution"" was necessary that would prevent future harm to Germans.<br/><br/>Valkyrie might have been better as a 'Made for TV' special. Instead of spending all that money about a minor footnote in the history of the Third Reich, wouldn't it have been better to focus on the complicity of the overwhelming majority of the German people who either enthusiastically embraced Hitler or looked the other way as he successfully carried out his nefarious plan of genocide and attempt at world domination?"
"dusan-22","2","7","14","31 August 2009"," Pale
","This is a dry and sterile feature filming on one of most interesting events in WWII and in history of warfare behind the front line. Bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing Hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event. There is no character development at all and idea that Tom Cruise suppose to play a high rank commander that questions his deepest inner thoughts on patriotism and treason is completely insane. I believe that Mister Bin would play it better. Generally speaking, film pretty much looks as a cheep copy of good German TV movie ""Stauffenberg"" from 2004, but can't get close to that film regarding any movie aspect whatsoever. However, movie obviously gets its financial goal with pop-corn audience that cherishes Hollywood fast-mood blood and shallow art values."
"gradyharp","10","5","9","21 May 2009"," An Unexpected Triumph
","VALKYRIE deserves wider attention than it received during its theatrical release, a theater run mired by the media emphasis on the tacky behind the scenes stories of the making of the film and the character destruction of Tom Cruise. This is a fascinating bit of World War II German history that is not as well known as the other aspects of the Third Reich and it bears telling. Writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander have used the facts of the 15th unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Hitler as spearheaded by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and molded a thriller and a classy drama populated by some of our finest actors. Director Bryan Singer manages to recreate Germany of 1944 and make it all look real - too real for comfort - and paces this complex mission with steady and harrowing momentum. <br/><br/>The film belongs to Cruise who is rarely off screen. His acting is solid and credible. The other actors whose presence gives the film a sense of realism are Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Terrance Stamp, Thomas Kretschmann, Eddie Izzard, Christian Berkel, Tom Hollander, Jamie Parker, Carice van Houten, and David Bamber (excellent in the role of Adolf Hitler). What makes this cast stand above the average ensemble crew is the sense of selflessness each actor brings to his/her role. Even though many of these fine actors are only on the screen for moments, their contribution is so well crafted (and directed) that the audience feels as though each is fully understood as members of this infamous historic event. <br/><br/>This film appears to be an honest, non-sensationalized view of history about which too few people are informed. As a quasi-documentary it holds up well: as a thrilling drama it deserves kudos. Grady Harp"
"kilo43","10","5","9","9 February 2009"," Excellent British film
","Forget all the emotional claptrap about glorifying Nazis's and all that rubbish from people with no historical knowledge of the period; this is a quality British film in essence, and it surprised me nothing I read mentioned this prior to watching it. (not that i read many reviews) An excellent almost exclusively British cast, somewhat let down by Cruise's performance (if for no other reason than he's the only actor not using a British/European accent), but at least Cruise is not continually the sole center of the films attention. Excellent camera-work, music (very subtle) and editing. If you enjoyed Conspiracy and Downfall, you'll love this film.<br/><br/>After watching it, the first thing I asked was ""Why on earth did Cruise do this film""?, he just seemed so out of place in it. I couldn't figure it out, mebbe investigating the funding might show why?"
"Chris Knipp","7","5","9","11 January 2009"," Language barrier
","Tom Cruise is fine in the role of Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, the well-born military leader of the last, spectacular attempted coup against Hitler. That is, he has the right bearing, that of a man of full confidence, born to command. Cruise himself may originally come from humble origins, but in stardom he has grown into the shoes at least of Hollywood aristocracy. He's a leading man, and so, made to lead. But in one way, he's out of place. The trouble is, though he plays a German, what he needs, and lacks, is an English accent. That's because the rest of the cast, Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nyhy, Tom Wilkinson, Tom Hollander, Eddie Izzard, and Terrence Stamp, to name a few, are English, and with their plummy voices they don't let you forget it. Of course, it's also hard to forget that Tom Cruise is Tom Cruise, despite the eye patch and the crisp uniforms.<br/><br/>Apart from the artificiality of the language, 'Valkyrie' rarely works up enough tension. And the fact that the assassination attempt is one that historically failed is no excuse, because 'Day of the Jackel' was about a failed attempt to kill De Gaulle, but it still kept its suspense coiled tight right up to the end. Anthony Lane has it right. The conspirators' scheme to use a Hitlerian emergency plan (called ""Valkyrie"") and fake an SS coup, is too complicated to follow, and the all-English cast gives us too many quirky character actors and not enough solid meat: these guys ""are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis."" Singer's direction is methodical, and the costumes and sets are nicely authentic, but the movie tries to do too much. It tries to set up a context of Von Stauffenberg's life and career, outline who all the main figures in the coup scheme are, depict the bomb/assassination attempt in specific detail, and describe the subsequent coup attempt, the Operation ""Valkyrie"" ruse to unseat the SS. There's just not enough focus here. In a suspenseful, well structured movie about these events, the bomb attempt would probably have been the main focus, and Von Stauffenberg would have been more central. After all, it's Tom Cruise! And he's special: he's American! <br/><br/>There are good moments. Von Stauffenberg's visit to a distracted, declining Hitler to get him to sign the revised ""Valkyrie"" plan is impressively staged and atmospheric. It captures a tiny bit of the kind of endgame mood Sokurov got in his unsuccessful but haunting 'Molokh' and Oliver Hirschbiegel delineated in detail in 'Downfall'. And there's more authentic danger in it--the danger of being in the presence of a madman with absolute power--than in the bomb sequence. Despite Lane's calling Wilkinson ""the ever-perplexed,"" he's pretty frightening as the intractable and mean General Friedrich Fromm. Bill Nihy, on the other hand, isn't appropriate as the indecisive General Friedrich Olbricht. He's too forceful an actor for such a role.<br/><br/>Lane is finally right in suggesting how fundamentally silly this kind of enterprise is. And yet there's a whole string of late-2008 releases about Nazism and its aftermath whose Germans all talk English -- 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,' 'The Reader,' 'Valkyrie,' 'Defiance.' Only 'The Boy in the Striped Pajamas' works in the unrealistic language, because it unfolds as a fable about innocence at the heart of evil. In the other films, which make claims to historical realism, the inappropriateness is jarring and the methodology -- one would hope, at least -- out of date. Germans should have made these movies. And as for having Cruise speak the opening paragraph of the film in German, well, that is laughable, and only draws attention to the pretense."
"mccoyan","9","5","9","1 January 2009"," Very good historical thriller
","I really enjoyed this move. All the actors did a fine job and were very convincing. This movie was a success because we all knew the plot was going to fail in the end, but the story was still very convincing and made the audience believe that it may actually work. Even though Cruise can't do a German accent and the other actors were not very 40s German like it was still a very enjoyable movie. This movie makes you think about what the world might have become if the bomb would have killed Hitler. It was a amazing to see them use the acid triggered fuse and think that was state of the art technology. The assassination plot was complex, but simple enough to work. Well done."
"rhklwk-1","10","5","9","1 January 2009"," Critics be Damned!
","I agree with every word PRAGERS wrote, below.<br/><br/>But what prompts me to add my additional comment is the absolute failure of the critics to rise above their dislike of Cruise and to recognize this film for the near-masterpiece that it is. As for Cruise, his performance is understated and nuanced. Only once was I reminded that he is, after all, an American, and never once was I reminded of his other work. This was a Cruise I had not seen before.<br/><br/>The film is superb story-telling. Everything about the production is excellent.<br/><br/>Here's is something I will always remember. The film was preceded by six (!!!) previews. Each preview was an assault on the nervous system: An explosion of color, motion, and sound -- and nothing else. When Valkyrie began to roll, suddenly my ears stopped ringing and my brain was engaged. Imagine! A film that depends on dialog! <br/><br/>And why don't the critics get it? Because in their arrogant, insulated world,they don't have to. I have no respect for them or their craft."

The supporting cast hold ups good although I found it hard to keep track of the many Nazi officers in involved in the coup.<br/><br/>All in all this movie delivers a very accurate and very good experience.

","Valkryie is a relatively intense thriller with an ending that we all know going into it, but that doesn't make it any less suspenseful. Well...maybe a little less suspenseful, but not significantly. The film has one fatal flaw though and that's it's complete lack of focus on it's characters. Bryan Singer made a decision to focus almost entirely on the attempted assassination on Hitler to the point where by the end we don't even know who these characters, aside from Stauffenberg, were that conspired to bring down Hitler. As far as I'm concerned, they were just a bunch of strangers in a room. The performances were good, giving each character a certain amount of presence, but after it all I still don't know who these men were. Tom Cruise definitely commanded the film with a driven performance that made him the high point of the picture, for me. And in the end, despite the lack of layers or exploration into the characters, the story still managed to be very suspenseful which made it fun to watch. And that ending was devastating."
"deathbyhippies5","9","8","17","26 December 2008"," One of the best films in years
","Valkyrie had a troubled past. From negative reactions to Tom Cruise in the lead to German not being spoken in the trailers, it seemed like Valkyrie would bomb and be forgotten about forever. I am very pleased to say that is not true.<br/><br/>If you don't already know, the story concerns Klaus von Stauffenberg, a high-ranking German official who is missing a hand and an eye, conspiring to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Obviously, the plan fails and Hitler survives, committing suicide nine months later in 1945.<br/><br/>Some people have said that Valkyrie is pointless because Stauffenberg and others did not succeed. It's not about the outcome, just like if a movie were made about a firefighter who died in the World Trade Center. It's all about the courage and bravery it takes to make that kind of decision in the first place. Those men risked everything to rid the world of a psychotic tyrant, and this film will help show people that not all Nazis were the evil super villains we like to think they were.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was incredible. Not once during the film did I think to myself ""Hey, that's Tom Cruise!"". He became Stauffenberg and stole every scene he's in. The other actors are excellent and convincing as well. I do like how Hitler wasn't portrayed as a brooding embodiment of evil. When the actor speaks, he doesn't growl or shout his lines monstrously. He simply talks, as you or I would. And that is very chilling.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is a fantastic movie, and one of the best I've seen in years. The cinematography, acting and suspense were handled masterfully. 9/10"

","I have two words, and you can apply them as well to the effort of the film makers as to the (falsified) assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler depicted in it : Ambitious, but rubbish !<br/><br/>As some other IMDb users explained in their comments, this movie fails to point out the real reasons for this assassination attempt : they felt Hitler was completely crazy, and they wanted to get rid of him to take over and do a better job. Col. Claus von Stauffenberg was as racist as his fuhrer, and so were all those generals on his side. Jews, Poles, Russians and anyone not being a blue eyed blond sucker answering to the name of Hans or Heinrich or whatever were considered by them as subhumans or worse. This movie tries to point out some good people within history's most guilty nation for committing crimes against humanity, then it gives some sort of explanation for why we never heard of such Germans back then.<br/><br/>You also get the sense that the behavior of the characters in military environment is much more American than German. It's like having American troops, but they're just dressed as Germans. So you never really have the impression that you're in Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>History = wrong<br/><br/>Entertainment = absent<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's performance = rubbish (he doesn't even get the ""ambitious"" adjective)"
"rhinocerosfive-1","4","6","12","7 June 2009"," Bad History Makes Bad Movie. Again.
","The British stage raped of its finest performers for a by-the-numbers American film: nothing new, and nothing particularly wrong with it either. It's nice to see Tom Wilkinson or Tom Hollander or Terence Stamp or Kenneth Cranham or Bill Nighy do anything, and I don't see as much London theater as I'd like. And you can't even say that Tom Cruise is bad in this thing, exactly, since he wisely does absolutely nothing except put on a uniform. While I suspect that he did this because he thought wearing jackboots might make him look taller (the scuttlebutt that he was attracted to the role because he thought he looked like Stauffenberg is amusing, in the sense that one devoted monomaniac would probably recognize himself in another), it is not a self-indulgent or incompetent performance that is the problem this time.<br/><br/>It's that the movie has no point. To entertain, a story must must must be about something more than its plot. Event has to illustrate theme. I have to learn something. JAWS isn't about a shark eating people, it's about people taking responsibility for their lives. VALKYRIE is about some Hollywood bigshots hearing a story about people facing responsibility, then turning it into an episode of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. In this movie I learn nothing except a lesson I already learned several movies ago: don't let Chris McQuarrie write your movie, and if you do, don't let Bryan Singer direct it. Because you'll end up with, at best, a twisty-turny thrill ride with clever dialog that winds up as empty as a bottle of Bud at a tractor pull; at worst, a straight-ahead snoozeathon just as meaningless.<br/><br/>If I told you the story of Claus von Stauffenberg going from idealistic patriot to disillusioned warrior to outraged mutineer, you would have a chance at seeing a grown-up's vision of the German experience of World War II, a people coming to grips with its own capacity for evil. If you saw a thriller about a man who tried to assassinate Hitler and failed, losing his life in the process, you would have a chance at being entertained. But if you see this movie, all you'll get is a series of opportunities for very good actors to wring their hands and shout, in scenes whose only connection is that they may have happened in real life in more or less this order. There's nothing new here, no revelation, no greater truth: it's just a thrill machine that never starts because the finger that should be pushing the buttons is busy dialing room service. I've seen more drama in an hour at the laundromat.<br/><br/>Besides all that is the central bullshit factor. The movie presents its protagonist as an anti-barbarian, pro-Semitic, gentleman superpatriot whose outspoken criticism of Third Reich policies got him relegated to Tunisia. The record suggests otherwise. Claus von Stauffenberg had no problem annexing the Sudetenland and crushing Poland, and his attachment to the 10th Panzer division was in fact a promotion. He seems to have believed in Hitler as a positive force for Germany until Germany began to lose the war, and was repeatedly asked to take part in coup attempts and refused, until his own career was derailed by injuries.<br/><br/>Not that I'm saying the inclusion of any of this would have made a better movie. That would have required certain directors of comic book movies to hire writers who weren't their buddies, and for everybody to face his responsibilities in the manner that Stauffenberg finally did."
"harris_dj","8","6","12","6 April 2009"," Great movie, though a remake.
","Before watching 'Valkyrie' I did some searching online and found a number of similar films. Of course I didn't know that this film was a remake, but upon finding this one particular film 'The plot to kill Hitler' I realized that 'Valkyrie' is the remake of that movie. Although 'The plot to kill Hitler' was released in 1990 I thought was quite a well made and educational movie, but naturally it was time for a remake... enter 'Valkyrie'.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 'Valkyrie' immensely and therefore highly recommend it not only for educational reasons but for entertainment value as well. The character portrayal was excellent with the entire cast(believable), not to mention the casting was superb, second to none. It had a very real feel throughout the movie, and you actually catch yourself hoping they'll successfully assassinate the Furer, but unfortunately history tells us otherwise. Once again Tom Cruise shows us why he's such a big star. I must admit though that I was skeptical of Cruise playing the lead role but he did an excellent job, I highly recommend it to all."
"Danusha_Goska","7","6","12","27 December 2008"," Caper Film; Nazism Plays Footnote
","""Valkyrie"" is a caper film in which Nazi Germany plays the traditional role of the caper's exotic background setting. Caper films demand local color; in ""Topkapi,"" the exotic background was Istanbul. Here it's Hitler's bunker and a swastika-bedecked Berlin. The film's primary emphasis is the primary emphasis of all caper films: a super competent, very good-looking lead, in scenes of nail-biting suspense, must carry out a daring stunt. In this case, the daring stunt just happens to be the assassination of Adolf Hitler. And that's really the importance that Hitler is given here  he's comparable to the jewels in a jewel heist film, rather than a human being whose evil challenges the very definition of the word ""human."" Placing the ""Nazi"" in ""Nazi Germany"" into the background of a big-budget, superstar, Hollywood treatment raises questions. As I, in the audience, focused, as the director, script and star were leading me to focus, on the details of the caper, rather than on the massive evil of Nazi Germany, I wondered: is this movie, intentionally or unintentionally, about making Nazism insignificant? There are no scenes, none, in which Tom Cruise's Stauffenberg interrogates Nazism and its relevance to Germany or German identity. Nobody else does, either. There are no scenes that even hint at the horrors that Nazis were perpetrating. There is no hint that the Generals' plot to assassinate Hitler would have been beside the point for millions: the plot occurred late in 1944, after millions of Jews, Rom, Slavs, and other innocent civilians had already met their death under Nazism's methodical brutality. The Allied invasion of Normandy Beach had already taken place. Heroic American soldiers and their Allies would soon take care of Hitler, as the German people never managed to do.<br/><br/>There is another major difference between this film and other big budget, Hollywood, WW II dramas that a veteran film-goer notices right away. The heroes have all the attributes so often assigned to film Nazis: they are ubermenschen. Their high, black leather boots shine. Their heels click. Their medals gleam. Their clean guns nest neatly against their impeccable uniforms. Their ranks are masterfully efficient and model a discipline that Leni Riefenstahl would love to film.<br/><br/>In other films, audiences view all those admirable cinematic qualities attributed to Nazis with some regret. ""Why can't the good guys be such supermen?"" Certainly Jews, Nazism's primary victims, are usually filmed as being underfed, dirty, cowering victims. American GIs are often scruffy and inarticulate. In ""Valkyrie,"" you get the ubermensch, and you get virtue in that envious, photogenic package.<br/><br/>Once the viewer realizes how relatively trivial Nazism is in this movie, and how superficially Nazi-like the good guys are, one has to ask, ""Does this film exist to exculpate  Germans? Germany? National Socialism?"" My guess is that no one involved in the making of this film had any of those goals. My guess is that other viewers besides me will be asking themselves similar questions while undergoing the odd experience of watching this caper film with the most vexed of pedigrees.<br/><br/>On a lighter note: the cast is a ""Who's Who"" of respected British and German stars who have not reached superstar status. You will recognize these players, but it will take you a moment to remember from where you recognize them. I had to suspend my immersion in the film for about five minutes after Der Fuhrer's first appearance. I *knew* I knew that guy  but from where  aha. Under history's most infamous mustache lurked the Reverend Mr. Collins, the bumbling, comical, thwarted suitor of the most popular TV costume drama of all time, A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice."" If the filmmakers gambled that no Jane Austen fans would attend ""Valkyrie,"" they gambled wrong. Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, Kenneth Branaugh, Tom Hollanderreally, for anglophile film fans, this was like some kind of skewed reunion.<br/><br/>German film fans get to see old friends, too. Thomas Kretschmann and Christian Berkel, so memorable in supporting Nazi roles in ""Downfall,"" ""The Pianist,"" and ""Black Book,"" are memorable here in other supporting roles. We should forgive the Germans just so that brilliant German actors get to play something other than Nazis."

","Valkyrie is a very good movie. The acting is beyond what the audience usually gets in today's movies, the direction is well done, and the script is well written. Tom Cruise is surprisingly very good in the movie. He is very convincing and actually has a strong screen presence. Valkyrie is a movie that he was made to be in. Kenneth Branagh also has a strong presence, but he is used very sparingly. Bill Nighy is as good as he usually is in every role he takes. Terence Stamp is marvelous. Tom Wilkinson is extremely good.

"Cinema_Fan","5","4","7","29 January 2009"," I will give them this: They certainly knew how to (over) throw a party.
","We all know that film, in general, has its target audience to appeal to, but what I really do find interesting concerning Valkyrie is that with the twenty or so people in this particular cinema screening a large proportion here were aged above sixty-five years of age. It seems that this, Valkyrie, appeals to a larger spectrum of age, albeit for reasons known to only the individual cinemagoer: Star-name, action, drama, historical value et al. It seems apparent that this movie has far more reaching appeal than first appears. Here we have a film that centres on the attempted murder of Adolf Hitler during the latter part of WWII by his own Officers'. While Bryan Singers's film takes its part in this niche of German history, this film does not really carry itself in the manner of a war film but gives an air of historical drama.<br/><br/>This too would apply to the supporting cast. With the international feel of an American Cruise (Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg), the British Branagh (Major-General Henning von Tresckow), Nighy (General Friedrich Olbricht), Wilkinson (General Friedrich Fromm), Stamp (Ludwig Beck) and Izzard (General Erich Fellgiebel) then there is the German Democratic Republican Kretschmann (Major Otto Ernst Remer), who, when called upon, give fine, strong and respectable performances'. Even with this flavour, the focal point is strongly on the resistance of these German Officers'. The Soldier takes on the might of the domestic germ of Hitler's right hand men, repelling Hitler's German National Socialist Party black shirted members': the Nazis and his S.S. personal bodyguards' (the paramilitary organization founded in 1925 who administrated the use of the Death Camp) and their dishonourable actions which have brought upon the face of Germany through their genocides and methods of control shame, disgust and revulsion.<br/><br/>Here we have Germanys best, Germanys fighting men, men who have known at first hand the honour of the battlefield and what it is to make sacrifice for a willing cause, Bryan Singer has given us an interpretation into the birth, life and death of the 20 July plot of 1944. Putting names to faces, even those faces and locations here seen only for a brief, but important, moment, such as Berlins Police Chief Wolf-Heinrich von Helldorfq and the actual Bendlerstrasse (Bendlerblock) building, used as place of execution of the conspirators.<br/><br/>Both Mr. Singer and Mr. Newton Thomas Sigel (cinematographer) gives Operation Walküre (the use of Germanys Reserve Army (Heer), who at a time of national unrest, of any description, would be awoken to quash any sign of rebellion or unrest) an arena of a keen sense of drama and tension. Plotting the death of Adolf Hitler is no after thought. We see a tight band of top ranking Officers believing in a just course, any doubt, and fear, here is reflected in the eyes of those who try to better Germany, and visualising this is only second best to the fraught realities and dangers that we see these men re- enact. There is simply no room for complacency. The risk is too high. Failure is not an option. The pace is set.<br/><br/>The authenticity of its environment in which we are given a firsthand account is both charming in its uses of deep focus and a feeling of depth and perspective for the eye to muster gives the particular subjects' here the demeanour of what these men symbolises in both prestige and heritage and the scope and goals for all concerned.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is a tale of pride and honour. We shall possibly never know the real men involved here: their politics, their beliefs, their traits and as the parting of the wave of time may have been distorted or lost forever, it feels and looks all the part an historical document that may be taken with a light pinch of salt and enjoyed for what it is. An exposé of the men who once tried and failed in their part to target, to slay the beast and to finally bring peace to Europe. A fitting stance that, seemingly, appeals to all spectrum's' ages to appreciate, understand and respect."
"blackburnj-1","7","4","7","26 January 2009"," Not a bad film, but a disappointment
","It is no secret to anyone with a passing knowledge of 20th century history that Hitler did not die on the 20th July 1944, and so the suspense of Bryan Singer's new thriller about the assassination plot which failed on that date seems to be irreversibly compromised.<br/><br/>It is strange therefore to report that there is some tension through the film, even though the ending is never in doubt. However, it is still a failure. There is a feeling with this film, much like Ed Zwick's ""Defiance"", that it should be better than it is  that this story merits a better film than the one it has ended up with.<br/><br/>That is not to say that this is a bad film. The quality of the film-making is excellent throughout and there is little to complain about. It looks good, sounds good and is generally well put together. A lot has been made of the lack of continuity with the accents but, despite the fact there are occasional slips into German twangs from some, there is no distraction in the diversity and it is far less irritating than the thick accents which have become the norm in many films.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. A number of liberties have been taken with the characters to make them heroic (von Stauffenberg, for instance, was in fact a raging anti-Semite), but there are still interesting figures here. Cruise's von Stauffenberg quickly becomes a fairly dull, generic hero (the fault of the writing and not the acting), but the outstanding supporting cast, which includes Ken Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Christian Berkel and Thomas Kretschmann, always make the film watchable. There is a particularly impressive performance from Bill Nighy, whose General Olbricht is probably the most interesting character in the film.<br/><br/>But the film never rises above the realms of simple, solid entertainment. It is by no means a dull two hours. In fact, the time flies by, but this never becomes truly thrilling. Perhaps it would have been better to have created more interest in the peripheral characters rather than the dull von Stauffenberg. One feels that there would have been more tension if you cared a bit more about the characters.<br/><br/>3 Stars out of 5"
"tkincaid","7","4","7","13 January 2009"," They got the history right!
","As a student of WWII, and a former German Gymnasium student, I can tell you that they got the history right. Did they leave out a lot - yes. Did they not mention how may people were executed as a result of the Valkyrie plot - yes. But they did show an important part of German history, and world history.<br/><br/>Whatever you think of Tom Cruise as a human being or as an actor, he really delivered in this film. He brought the right combination of patriotism and megalomania to pull of this part.<br/><br/>Von Stauffenberg was not a saint - but he was a good man, determined to save his country from the very worst it had done. He was racist and pro-Germany - but so was every other high-ranking German officer (and German aristocrat) of the times.<br/><br/>The movie builds toward it's chilling climax, showing the desperation and futility of the plotters. The scenes in Berlin during the few hours of the attempted coup show people's heroism and devotion.<br/><br/>Whether we like their characters' motives or not, Valkyrie did happen, and it was important."
"kitten5135","8","4","7","9 January 2009"," Cruise = Stauffenberg ; Walkürie
","Operation Valkyrie is in effect! Opened Christmas Day, 2008, was another of the World War II films, but this was different. Much different. Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the leader of the Resistance rebelling against Hitler. His ""side-kicks"" include Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, and Tom Wilkinson. The film is based around the movement to assassinate Hitler and move their group into power using an operation called Valkyrie that Hitler himself had approved upon.<br/><br/>I found this film very interesting, and a good lesson, especially for someone like myself who has never heard of the details of the attempt assassinations of Adolf Hitler. The acting was fantastic, especially Tom Cruise with his eye-patch that covered half his face. I thought it would be a distraction or minimize the amount of expression in his face, but he did a fantastic job! And, of course, Bill Nighy and Kenneth Branagh are always stunning in whatever parts, big or small, that they take in any film.<br/><br/>As I watched the film, I was listening mostly for the writing than watching for the cinematography or other. And the writing was fantastic, and I can't wait to get some official quotes out on the internet (because I LOVE the deep, thoughtful quotes of movies or books). Anyways, one other concern I have heard from others is about the lack of German accents in the film (because, yes they are Germans, not allies), but I say no concern for them. I find that accents in this film would have distracted from some of the more important scenes. If anything, it makes the film just a little bit better.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was great and is definitely worth the price of the theater tickets, the popcorn, and the DVD when this is released. It belongs on the shelf next to Downfall."
"The_Film_Addict","8","4","7","8 January 2009"," ""Valkyrie"" had an intelligent cast and crew worthy of telling it.
","I swear by God this sacred oath: that I shall render unconditional obedience to Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich and people, supreme commander of the armed forces, and that I shall at all times be ready, as a brave soldier, to give my life for this oath. Wehrmacht Oath<br/><br/>""Valkyrie"" poses a question: How can one surrender allegiance to a leader whose ideals are beyond comprehendible? During a time when expressing opposition would result in severe consequences, Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, wonderfully portrayed by Tom Cruise, and a group of courageous individuals, defied the status quo and dared to do the unthinkable when they attempted to assassinate Hitler. ""Just remember,"" warns General Ludwig Beck (Terrance Stamp), ""nothing ever goes according to plan."" Though Stauffenberg is well aware of the impending outcome, he proceeds anyway. That's bravery.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's suspensefully crafted ""Valkyrie"" revolves around the events of July 20, 1944, in which Col. Stauffenberg, following an intricate plan, carefully placed a briefcase containing a bomb during a meeting in Hitler's ""Wolf Layer."" With Hitler out of the picture, Operation Valkyrie, a contingency plan designed to protect the Nazi regime in the event of a threatening disruption, would come into effect. Ironically, through strategic deception, Operation Valkyrie was signed by Adolph Hitler, who was unaware that the plan would be used as a counter attack which would mislead Hitler's Reserve Army into thinking they were fighting for his government. Though we know Hitler's eventual fate, Valkyrie never becomes a bore. Through ingenious film-making, Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) milks ""Valkyrie's"" nail-biting suspense and delivers a gripping, entertaining historical thriller. <br/><br/>The resemblance between Cruise and Stauffenberg is uncanny. Cruise, whose career went downhill after the release of ""War of the Worlds,"" brings an interesting resonance to Stauffenberg. Though Cruise gives a stiff performance, it's properly justified. With Hitler's Germany unleashing catastrophic damage, how could Stauffenberg, who had dear love for his country, not be grim about its eventual outcome? Equipped with an elite cast including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Eddie Izzard, and ""Black Book's"" Carice van Houten, as Stauffenberg's wife Nina von Stauffenberg, ""Valkyrie"" never falters. Even though the cast doesn't experiment with adopting German accents, due to Bryan Singer's film-making niche, it never becomes a distraction.<br/><br/>Re-teaming with screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie, who penned Singer's ""The Usual Suspects,"" ""Valkyrie"" flows seamlessly on its suspense. Opening with a lackluster beginning, Valkyrie's emotional grasp kicks in during its second act. Though the film works primarily on its entertainment factor, the film's dramatic intensity places ""Valkyrie"" on a higher level. These individuals, knowing the consequences, went with their gut instincts and decided to act for the benefit of the nation, and the world. It's an inspiring story that needs to be told. Luckily, ""Valkyrie"" had an intelligent cast and crew worthy of telling it."
"taylorsasso","8","4","7","4 January 2009"," Valkrie is amazing
","I can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Valkyrie definitely deserved the classification of thriller. Not one of those horror movie thrillers but a real life, real situation suspenseful movie.<br/><br/>Brian singer did and excellent job in creating suspense. Through out the movie I was constantly telling myself: Is the plan going to work? or Come on do it already!<br/><br/>With that said, the acting was very very good. As well it should be for a high quality film. David Bamber portrayed Hitler as a person who was by no means invincible, but as a person who, in less pleasant terms, a sick looking individual. In similar ways the joker was brought to life by Head Ledger.<br/><br/>This movie had by far the most impact on me then any movie has ever had in terms of heroism, loss, and redemption. The last 15 minutes of the film literally gave me chills. <br/><br/>All in all this is defiantly as must see for any person that loves the film industry. An 8+ in my book."
"ddelamaide","9","4","7","2 January 2009"," Real heroes deserve wide audience
","This film is about real heroes in an heroic action that is little known outside Germany and deserves a wide audience for that reason alone. Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) never waver, and their courage and conviction are truly inspiring.<br/><br/>But the film also captures the ambivalence of a conspiracy, because it also includes people who are not heroes. Olbricht's (Bill Nighy) vacillation may have made the difference between success and failure. Fromm's (Tom Wilkinson, brilliant as always) prevarication is abhorrent, but perhaps the most common of all stances.<br/><br/>The wonderful coming to life of the whole event shows again the magic of cinema. The attention to detail -- the planes, the vehicles, the uniforms, the settings -- pays off in transporting the viewer into the event. We literally become eyewitnesses to history. And it is moving that the final scene is played in the very Bender Block courtyard where the real event took place.<br/><br/>Is Cruise perfect? No. It is a shame that the actor cannot be lost in the character in the same way that he was in Tropic Thunder. Yes, it's the accent, but also the mannerisms, the attitude. Stauffenberg was a hero, but he was not a Top Gun. But the movie may not have been made without Cruise's participation and apparently the locations may not have as authentic without his help, and he does look somewhat like Stauffenberg, and he did try. Everyone else, as many comments have noted, was terrific and very close to perfect."

","I am surprised that some critics and others were looking for more ""character development"" and drama in this incredibly intense movie - I suspect there are people who need to know more history of Hitler's Germany to understand how terrible it was, and why even saying you did not like Hitler was dangerous. Every move the plotters made was tricky and nuanced. One critic suggested we needed to know more about why the soldiers plotting the coup did not like Hitler ... good grief, this was not about a why they wanted to walk in the park together - there were at least a dozen well known reasons why Hitler needed to be dead, even to Germans. No, it is not a feel good movie ... but it is about heroism at it's best. The script wasn't packaged to have people leaving feeling up beat. Reality does not work that way. It can be painful. BTW, I think Tom Cruise is a nut case, but did fine job of not over doing his role here and was credible in his role."

Mr singer does not condescend or preach..<br/><br/>the supporting actors are all first rate, absolutely top notch. i have no idea if they are historically accurate.. but the emotions that they chose to portray were entirely and wholly believable to me, as a viewer. namely, the uncertainty about the plot, the doubts, the hesitation, the pondering, and the fear. they were not instant cereal box heroes, many were worried about their own skin, and not pure bred idealists.<br/><br/>tom cruise, will of course be criticized... because of his acting, or because he is a scientologist. but i think his acting here is spot on. he is arrogant, brash, over confident, and a little annoying.. which is exactly what you need to be a coup assassin. let me just ask, who else could have played this role, in this movie, as well as Mr cruise? Mel Gibson? brad Pitt? George clooney? and make no mistake, its a Hollywood movie.. they needed a Hollywood star to make it...<br/><br/>as for Mr cruise' scientology... clearly the man is a professional and did not bring anything to the film set except his dedication to do a good job in this role. i don't like a lot of things the CoS does, then again, i don't like a lot of things that religions do... or atheists for that matter. so give the guy a break. its not like he eats babies (err.. right?)<br/><br/>my only quibble is with the ending. (ok, if it turns out there are horrible historical mistakes, id quibble with that too...but i have to give them as much a break as i would any history based thriller). i wish it would have been a Hollywood ending! yes, the hero dies, we all know its coming. but what about 'saving private Ryan' ending? that was a beautiful ending. what about an ending showing the German resistance memorial, in the modern day? i think it would have been nice to say that dying to stop Hitler, was not such a tragedy... the tragedy would have been if he had not tried to stop Hitler. <br/><br/>and there are some who say 'it was too late in the war... would have made no difference'... but there were hundreds of thousands, if not millions, killed in the last 9 months of the European war. and for those who say, these men just wanted power, not to save Europe.... well, this movie clearly shows that angle... as i mentioned above. the actors are brilliant. <br/><br/>i must also praise the set people and photographers, costume and props departments. the scenes of soldiers dashing about various buildings, the plane rides, the wolfs lair... they all add very much to the drama and emotion of the film.. in the best tradition of Hollywood popcorn munching film. yes it might be unnecessary, but it is not unwelcome. i would dare to say, it rather drew me in and helped transport me. <br/><br/>anyways, if you are a neo Nazi, you will probably hate this film.. so go skip it. if you have no interest in politics or history, also skip it. if you want a lot of killing, explosions, and mindless action, skip it. if you are still reading this, after all i have said... then you might like it."

","The plot to kill Hitler is certainly worth a good film. They slipped it into the ""Night of the Generals,"" as a sub plot, but now it gets full focus. While it is a watchable film, and it follows the history quite accurately, it ends up being a docudrama with not much creativity or tension.<br/><br/>What could have added meat to the plot could have been to have given the growth of anti Hitler sentiment more attention, as well as the cultural clash between the officer class and the Nazis.<br/><br/>Many critics are down on Cruise. I think he's a capable actor, but to have him as the sole guy with an American accent - surrounded by mostly Brits - is rather ludicrous, but it didn't distract me too much.<br/><br/>It would have been nice if they had used some of the many capable German/Austrian actors. Speaking English, of course. Can't have subtitles for an American film! By now we should be well past the tradition of having Brits only playing Nazis. Actors are so good at accents these days, so if your going to use English speaking actors why not use German accents? The other problem I have with the film is the focus on the guys who wanted to bet rid of Hitler as ""good guys."" Von Stauffenberg was known to have made anti semitic comments in his letters to his wife, and I'm sure many in the officer class were anti Semites as well. Their effort to rid themselves of Hitler was not simply a noble cause, it was a plot by one class to get back some of their tarnished honor. Honor tarnished by the Nazis and the SS. Honor which certainly pushed Germany into it's attempt to create an empire. The movie completely side stepped this paradox, and it is the movies insistence on showing history in simplistic terms that lessens it's impact."

","Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men, X2, Superman Returns) steps away from his typical fantastic stories and instead embarks on a straight-forward historical drama with Valkyrie.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of the German resistance's plot to kill Hitler, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a decorated war hero secretly against the Fuhrer. He gets an opportunity to do something about it by joining the German resistance, and they plot a daring coup to topple Hitler's Germany.<br/><br/>Carice van Houten (who oddly looks like Vilma Santos!) plays von Stauffenberg's wife Nina, and while without much dialogue, effectively transmits emotion on screen with the slightest of expressions. This acting style is strongly echoed by the rest of the cast: Kenneth Branagh (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Hamlet) plays the cunning Major-General Henning von Tresckow, who enlists him in the resistance; Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, Notes on a Scandal, Love Actually) plays the wishy-washy General Friedrich Olbricht and Tom Wilkinson (Michael Clayton, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) plays the careerist General Friedrich Fromm. The handsome Thomas Kretschmann (The Pianist, King Kong) plays yet another ironic role as Nazi supporter, Major Otto Ernst Remer.<br/><br/>Reminiscent of Ang Lee's Lust, Caution, Valkyrie is beautifully told in bittersweet fashion. The suspense and drama are efficiently translated by the stellar cast, told in a wonderful, old-school way of storytelling. Educational and entertaining."

","VALKYRIE is an intense thriller despite the fact that it stars actors who don't do German accent. Having said that, it does have its flaws but Bryan Singer's sharp direction puts you in this race against time that is so well-played, those few flaws can be considered as collateral damage. From beginning to the end, it wastes no time on drama, everything is fast-paced. Entertainment is what you'll get.<br/><br/>I didn't like Superman Returns, so VALKYRIE to me redeems Bryan Singer who I think is better off doing thriller/action gigs like this one. He has the sixth sense to orchestrate each scene that is bound to keep you on the edge of our seat. It makes you wanna know what's going to happen next. And just like the assassination plot itself, every little second counts. The key is to remind the audience that nothing ever goes according to plan, there's always a change beyond our control, whether it's the weather or any type of element. What Bryan Singer manages to do is display and escalate them in a way that would get your attention fixed on the screen. We all know how it's going to end, it's based on real history, so it all now depends on showing how they may have pulled this off, it's about the process. Having said that, I gotta admit, this is one hell of a production.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does look like Colonel Stauffenberg, we've seen the comparison photos over the web, but I still think someone better could do the job. Is it just me or does Tom Cruise often seem like he's mimicking Jimmy Fallon where he tries to look serious but you can tell there's a hint like he's about to laugh. But, every time Cruise expresses his anger, I am reminded of how awesome he is at showing mad temper ala Bourn on the Fourth of July. So there is still that good point, if you will. The eye-patch thing looks a bit silly but I'd rather have that than the creepy eye-ball he carries around. I think the movie could've done without it. In my humble opinion, Thomas Kretschmann (King Kong, Wanted) who's also in this movie as the leader of the reserved army, should've been the one to play Stauffenberg. Casting so many well-known British actors to play German officers probably won't throw you off but there has got to be some German actors who can speak English out there who should've gotten the shot at playing these characters.<br/><br/>Their plan seemed so perfect at the time. Can you imagine if it had worked?! If only they'd done it the first time around, if only the explosives were more powerful, if only they didn't rush into action without confirming every single assumed information. German people might think their heroes are being exploited by this American-made film but it's obvious that VALKYRIE does intend on doing them justice."

","I like this movie very much, even though for the life of me I cannot spell the title. Tom Cruise got far on his good looks, but he proves here that he is a fine actor as well. This is his finest acting since A Few Good Men. I never thought I would say this about a Nazi but Von Stauffenburg was a very brave and heroic man and had his plot suceeded, he would have been REVERED as the man who killed Hitler and ended the war. This movie has excellent performances all around (even though the lack of German accents does get confusing). The greatest compliment I can pay the filmmakers is that even though I knew how it was going to turn out, my stomach was still in knots as the plot unfolded. SPOILER ALERT, the only reason why Hitler wasn't killed is that an SS Officer kicked Von Stauffenbur's briefcase bomb under the table and a heavy oak table support deflected part of the blast from Hitler. Anyway, this is a good first class thriller about brave men who saw true evil and decided to do something about it."

","The first thing I want to say in writing this review is that anyone even vaguely familiar with history will already know how this movie turns out. The fact that the director managed to make this film suspenseful despite an inevitable ending is the most impressive aspect of this film. Given that I am an avid fan of military history, particularly from World War II, I just had to see this movie. Now I am not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise since the guy has gone down as a bit of a psycho, but he did a top-notch job portraying the tragically doomed Colonel Stauffenberg. Another impressive feat that the makers pulled off was that the people they cast actually resembled their historical counterparts, particularly Hitler. The music was what kept this movie going, however. It was well-crafted and I was hooked from beginning to end, every minute. Best movie of the holiday season I have seen to date.<br/><br/>9/10.

","But not a masterpiece, Valkyrie is Hollywood's attempt to make a film about the plot to assassinate Hitler. You can tell by the advertising, the casting, the tag-line. And it's probably the best film ever made with tom cruise playing a German with an eye-patch. It is somewhat saved by excellent direction from Bryan Singer (X2, The Usual Suspects, etc.) It's entertaining enough to watch once, but not enough to buy the DVD or repeat viewings. If you want 2 hours of more back story to what happened to Col. Von Stauffenburg and the operation, this is exceptional. If your looking for a film equivalent to Saving Private Ryan, you will be disappointed."
"mattbg","7","3","5","2 May 2009"," Historically interesting, but bad casting
","I found Valkyrie to be historically interesting and well-told, but there were problems with the casting. Most of the people in the cast were fine actors, but the problem is that they picked some of the most English of the English actors -- people whose Englishness is central to their presence like Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Bill Nighy, which makes for a strange contrast when we're asked to believe that they're German.<br/><br/>My complaint isn't to do with accents: I'd much rather actors act in their native accent when playing foreign characters than speak English with a German accent, which is rather insulting to the audience. It's that the actors they chose are so quintessentially English.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise did an OK job, I think. But I was frequently reminded of his character in ""The Firm"". It was a very similar role when you look at what's really going on in both movies."
"angelsfang","Null","3","5","3 March 2009"," Underdog status made this movie a hell of an experience for me
","***NOTE*** This review contains minor spoilers, but they are historical spoilers, not fictional or movie plot spoilers.<br/><br/>With all the negative reviews surrounding Valkyrie when it first released, it was way down the list of movies to see for most people. Most flocked to check out the Oscar nominees, or more popular titles like The Wrestler and Gran Torino, even Jim Carrey's Yes Man. But when I finally got around to seeing this once it premiered in Hong Kong, I was simply blown away.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, no matter how his personal life is, delivers on the silver screen where it matters. I've heard some professional critics complain that he was a bit stiff, but to be honest I have hardly ever seen the real Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg even in other films, so I wouldn't know how accurate Tom's portrayal was. The only thing I do know, is that he commanded most of the scenes in the movie. This is no easy task when you're up against Bill Nighy. The other supporting cast was excellent as well, especially Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Christian Berkel, who was absolutely wonderful as Colonel Quirnheim. I do not know too much of German actor Christian Berkel, apparently he was also in Der Untergang which I enjoyed very much, he was superb in Valkyrie. Another point of interest is that, despite already knowing the outcome of the plot, the ending scenes are still extremely gripping and emotional. Bryan Singer deserves much of the credit for an amazing job.<br/><br/>As a closing note, no matter if you like or hate Tom Cruise, or whether or not you enjoyed the movie, it did a significant job portraying the brave men that stepped up and resisted. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, General Friedrich Olbricht, Herr Ludwig Beck, Herr Erwin von Witzleben, General Erich Fellgiebel, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim, and all those who lost their lives as a result of the assassination attempt; they tried, they did not succeed, but they will be remembered."
"dreamdemon-1","9","3","5","2 March 2009"," History is here
","I just saw the movie and I must say I was quite pleasantly impressed. For one I thought it will be a cheap dramatic shot with cheesy lines but even though it had a lot of this too, there's much more to the movie.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is based on the ""July 20"" plot when a handful of politicians and military men decided to get rid of Hitler. Historically, the invoked reason was the poor course of war and the Holocaust but the personalities behind the plot are much less documented than the actual events. ""Valkyrie"" does a good job at following the historical events, for the documented part and does an even better job at extrapolating what happened in the more shady areas of history. The plot focuses on col Stauffenberg and his role (slightly exaggerated) in the plot to assassinate Hitler and use the contingency plan dubbed ""Valkyrie"" to contain a possible counterstrike and ensure that power remains with the revolutionaries. When sheer chance foils the plot, Hitler's response is swift.<br/><br/>I must say that Tom Cruise is the only weak link here. Whether his fault or the writer's (or both, more likely), doesn't matter. What matters is that he overacts a lot and has been 'gifted' with about all the movie's cheesy lines, which he delivers in a very artificial way.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy plays Friedrich Olbricht, a head plotter, in a rather flat manner and he lacks presence and authority which result in a less than believable character. I like Nighy a lot, but he fails to deliver here.<br/><br/>Weak links aside, we are left with Terrence Stamp, Kevin McNally, Tom Wilkinson and Christian Berkel who manage to do a great job and bring historical credibility to the characters. This is not just because of the physical resemblance, but also because of a genuine style in which they play.<br/><br/>Of them, I like Wilkinson's rendition of Friedrich Fromm the most, although it was not mentioned that Fromm was also executed in the end. I didn't like the writing because Fromm was presented as ambivalent (wanting to remove Hitler but hesitant to join the plot) while in reality he was one of the few plotters which had the determination and will to act (alongside Stauffenberg and Goerdeler), in the end he tried to save himself by arresting everyone else and ended up facing the firing squad as well.<br/><br/>Stamp's Beck is presented mostly as civilian even though he was a General as well.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to all WWII 'fans' out there and for those seeking more than history, please try to overlook Cruise's overacting and cheesiness."
"ghostflash","8","3","5","22 February 2009"," Fascinatingly Accurate - In More Ways Than One
","Most people are familiar with the assassination attempts on Hitler but few people know the details of what really happened. This film provides an accurate, not to mention entertaining, glimpse into history and details what really went on. The accuracy of the film is one of the main things to commend it for. Some of the locations in the film are the actual locations where the events took place which brings so much immediacy to the film. Even the sets which were copied or created look startlingly authentic. The level of set design is astonishing. There are so many small details and colours. It wasn't nominated for an Oscar but thrillers hardly ever get nominated because of the narrow mindedness of the academy, and who cares about awards anyway.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this marvellous film, is the acting. Rarely is such a meaty ensemble cast assembled. Tom Cruise, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp and many more are some of the finest actors around today. There is only one principle female actor but it's a military story so one should expect this. Tom Cruise especially stands out (well of course, he's the lead actor) in a thrillingly nuanced role. Unfortunately though, the decision was made for all the actors to speak in their own accents, which marrs the authenticity slightly. Despite the opening being in German and cleverly turning into English, it is still a bit annoying that they don't do German accents. Some speak with an English accent, some American and some German. Aside from that, one has to realise it would be the first major Hollywood picture full of stars to speak with a German accent. And if they all spoke with German accents there would have inevitably been some very awkward accents and it would have brought down the acting quality.<br/><br/>The key theme the film explores is about making a difficult choice. One of the Nazi staff has a very telling line in which he says ""We cant be neutral any longer and when we make a choice we've got to come down on the right side"". Bryan Singer constructs a fascinating portrayal of this very human dilemma and the film shows all the anguish and indecision and consequences of choices like these.<br/><br/>Even though we know how the story ends it doesn't stop Singer being very successful in pile-ling on the suspense. The tension is electrifying as Stauffenberg plants the bomb and hurriedly tries to make an escape. You really suspend your disbelief and hope the assassination will work. You desperately hope it will be successful even though you know it wont. And one just has to sit and watch the achingly beautiful climax."
"badajoz-1","6","3","5","5 February 2009"," Brave attempt
","No spoiler required - Hitler doesn't get killed! A thriller attempt to tell the July 20 plot that succeeds in engaging one, but misses a trick when it does not portray clearly enough the all-pervading menace and danger of trying to overthrow Nazism. It's as if the script assumes that everyone remembers from their school History syllabuses the Nazis and their bad press! Character development is a little short - again it is assumed that everyone in the audience is against Hitler so no need for subtlety or variation of motive of his adversaries. Tom Cruise does a noble job of not dominating the action, while Bill Nighy acts in this as opposed to being just himself. But the endless parade of English thesps - I don't include Eddie Izzard as one! - detracts for a British audience the germanic nature of the story. I'm afraid David Bamber's Hitler(OK as a performance) is a direct crib from 'Downfall,' so why didn't Bruno Ganz do it! Kenneth Cranham as Keitel is awful, but the film does not overegg the pudding, and largely succeeds in portraying a difficult moment in time as the Nazi regime crumbles, but too many Germans watch and wait for the Allies to finish off the monster."
"Robert_duder","8","3","5","26 January 2009"," A captivating and interesting spin on the World War II story and Hitler himself
","Leave it up to the recently controversial Tom Cruise to find a film that people can bicker and argue and get all bunched up about. As usual most of the complaints about the film are ludicrous. ""Supporting Nazis."" ""Painting Nazis in a good light."" ""Actors make ridiculous Nazis."" Valkyrie is the furthest thing from all these things. Instead it is actually a very mainstream film, part drama, part action by a very mainstream director telling a story from a very different perspective. World War II films are a dime a dozen but there are few if any films from the Nazi perspective about an internal plot to kill Hitler which history shows us happened a lot. That means that there were some Nazis, Germans, soldiers, whatever you want to call them that did want to kill Hitler. The film packs in intensity and action and special effects and some decent, solid performances to make a very entertaining film. The reason you're not seeing it sweep any award shows is that Valkyrie tries less to be true to history or emotionally binding then it does to be mainstream entertainment which means when watching it the viewer should be taking it with a grain of salt, not looking for historical inconsistencies or how bad someone's German accent is or isn't.<br/><br/>Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise plays the lead role of a disenchanted German soldier. I don't care about Cruise's personal life, I have always thought he was a great actor, with great Hollywood charm. Cruise lights up the screen and looks great with his ominous eye patch and dark coats and Nazi hats. He commands presence on screen. Bill Nighy was okay if his character was meant to be quiet and withdrawn and kind of weak willed. He does alright but certainly his character and his performance doesn't command much of anything. Tom Wilkinson does a great job as the loud and bulbous Friedrich Fromm. He doesn't have a big role but he does well in the part. David Bamber is terrific and does a great job as the evil man himself Herr Adolf Hitler. Hitler is a mysterious character and somehow they make him look like a celebrity of sorts among his men and his presence and everything about him shows his charisma and his nature and Bamber is brilliant in the role. He really does bring something to the subtle but powerful role.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer is the exact definition of a mainstream director having headed up action films for a lot of years. So what could he bring to Valkyrie? Well I think the film is more friendly to the average film goer who is going to be entertained about a piece of war history even if it's not the most accurate docu-drama out there. Singer wants to tell a story, but still blow things up and show off some Hollywood stars and despite some of the content surrounding Valkyrie if you go into the film as a piece of entertainment then you will be entertained and if you have insatiable curiosity like me you will look into the more truthful stories behind the assassination attempts on Hitler. Doesn't matter what you think about the content Valkyrie is an entertaining movie that one can enjoy for it's face value and Cruise is great in it. 8/10"

It's a good thing we don't take too much notice of the nay-sayers! This is a very, very good movie. If any of Stauffenburg's family are still alive today ie/ children or grandchildren I hope they are proud of what this man, and others that supported him, tried to do.

Enjoy this movie for what it is; World War II history and one of the attempts on Hitler's life. There were Nazis who understood the evil of Hitler and knew he had to be taken out. As far as the complaints about the accents of the characters, those complainers must have missed the opening five minutes of the film (and that's all I'll say about that because it was a very creative intro). I'm a huge fan of the MI series as well as his recent comedy piece in Tropic Thunder).

Belatedly they realized what they had done, by which time it was too late. In retrospect, even if they succeeded in killing Hitler, I doubt that it would have been the end of the story: Goering, Himler,Goebels and other Nazi henchmen almost certainly would have put down the coup, with or without Hitler.

","""Valkyrie"" as the trailers reveals, is about the last assassination attempt made on Hitler's life and the attempted overthrow of the government. The trailers though depict the movie as an action thriller. There is some action, but it is minimum yet that does not make the movie dull at all. Even though the outcome is predictable as I read in my history books, the film moves a mile a minute with suspense and drama. <br/><br/>I was not impressed by Bryan Singer's last movie, ""Superman Returns"", but in this, he pulls the audience into the depth of these brave characters' plots and schemes. Their motives may not be fully explained, but they are still believable and easy to sympathize with. I personally found Kenneth Branagh's and Tom Wilkinson's performances the best in the supporting category. <br/><br/>They are two characters of the opposite spectrum. Branagh's character wants to see this mission through while Wilkinson's character is afraid and on the fence, willing to do anything to cover his butt. As with Tom Cruise, he gives an electrifying performance as Claus Von Stauffenberg. I will admit that I think he needed to work on a German accent to make him more fit for the role. Then again, the majority of the actors in the film were either British or American.<br/><br/>I have no problem with that, but some realistic German accents would have made it more authentic like with the English speaking Germans in ""Battle of the Bulge"". I shouldn't complain too much though, since the film starts off with Cruise speaking fluent German and then transfers to English so the audience don't have to read too many subtitles. Overall, ""Valkyrie"" is a suspenseful thriller that sheds light on an incident in history, which reveals the courage that men were willing to take, to save a nation from destroying itself."

Cruise did a nice job as Stauffenberg, the crippled colonel who finds himself in the middle of a plot to kill the Fuhrer. The other supporting actors are also good, although I think some German accents would have done wonders for the realism effect.<br/><br/>The last half of the movie is pure suspense. I had the misfortune of sitting next to some goon who insisted on narrating the whole film... if that guy never existed, I think I would have enjoyed Valkyrie a lot more. Nonetheless, this is a good movie to take a trip back 70 years and see a different side of the National Socialist Party.

Claus von Stauffenberg, one of the ""good"" German Wehrmacht officers who fights for his country, not his Fuhrer. It is certainly not one of his more romantic leading man roles, as he spends much of the movie in an eye patch and a pretty bad hairdo (even worse than his mop in ""The Last Samurai"").<br/><br/>Wounded in North Africa in 1943, he is transferred to Berlin and there falls in with other conspirators who seek to overthrow the National Socialist government and sue for peace with the Allies.<br/><br/>By this time, the war has definitely gone against Germany with the U.S., British and Russian forces closing in and with many believing that Hitler is mad, the only course in their minds is to eliminate him and try to save the nation.<br/><br/>Of course, this is not easy and other attempts have failed because of bad planning or faulty design. When von Stauffenberg becomes involved, however, things finally begin to move in a more positive direction.<br/><br/>Joining Major-General von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh, ""Henry V""), General Olbricht (Bill Nighy, ""Hot Fuzz"") and civilian political outcast Ludwig Beck (Terrance Stamp, ""Yes Man""), among others, von Stauffenberg organizes an assassination attempt on Hitler to take place at a bunker in July 1944.<br/><br/>The colonel suggests using the plan Operation Valkyrie, which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army to maintain order, to take control of the government after successfully assassinating Hitler.<br/><br/>This involves a complicated series of changing long-standing official orders, clever bureaucratic maneuvering and even attempting to get Hitler himself to give his final okay on the alterations.<br/><br/>While this is going on, Gen. Friedrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson, ""Batman Begins"") is straddling the fence to see which side wins. And while just about everyone in this historical drama does a fine job, Wilkinson' character is especially cynical and diabolical.<br/><br/>Anyone who knows anything about World War II will realize the plot in July of 1944 failed, so I'm not giving anything away here, but why it did not work is discussed in great detail, as is what happened immediately afterward.<br/><br/>It also makes for a fine suspense movie in its own right and director Bryan Singer (""X-Men"" films) is appropriately hands-off, letting the build up take the place of the foregone conclusion. This is far from the greatest film on the genre, and will certainly not earn the box office that many of Cruise's other efforts have attained, but it should be seen for its historical take and fine performances, if nothing else.<br/><br/>It may take some individuals a little time to get used to Tom Cruise with the eye patch, but the movie should be experienced by younger audiences who may not know the full, true story."

The actors portray them as if they have nothing to worry about and as if there is no need to wonder about the individuals they are in cahoots with. i would recommend that people save their money and buy a mocha at the airport. It is obvious that everyone involved in the making of this movie have no regard for history and hope to rewrite the way things were. Germans were evil, the allies killed most of them and those that were left all swear they had nothing to do with it. This movie is a sham and tries to offer an apology for mass sheepishness. Do you really want us to believe that the whole time Jews were being taken from their homes that they were the only ones who knew? Their neighbors didn't know? Get real. Waste of money, unless you were looking for another MI movie, if thats the case it is great.

","This movie has gotten a huge amount of bad PR(no thanks to Mr. Cruise's activity of late), but it is actually a very good film. The supporting cast including such veterans as Bill Nighy and Tom Kenneth Branagh amongst others, is exceptional in the way they really humanize a group of people all universally regarded as 'all bad' by much of the American public. This film will grab you and make you think a little differently on some of the men in Hitler's high command. Their actions regardless of the outcome put Hitler's command in disarray and as a result made Hitler less trusting and weakened his government likely saving many more lives. Catholics, monarchists, and republicans all worked together for the true good of their country to fight Hitler. This film has flaws, but Cruise was not one of them.<br/><br/>A very good movie."

","I have only seen half at this stage, but it seems to me to be a gigantic, and very well done homage to Visconti's masterful 'Gotterdammerung'. Normally if I see Tom Weirdo in the credits, I don't bother even starting the spools, much less finishing. But when one sees Branagh, Nighy, Stamp & Wilkinson amongst the first XV, you know you have a team that can compensate for even a half-wit at Five-Eighth. He actually does not do a bad job, but the Fullback is Singer's never-ending cues back to 'The Damned'. It actually works better without all the sexual weirdness that Luchino just had to inject into all his sumptuous, high camp melodramas. If I get to the Macbeth bit, it gets a 10 and I will be very happy indeed! In any case, you are not wasting your time and you can then Google ""Luchino Visconti"" and really begin to live."

This movie of course stretches credibility in parts, but let's be honest the primary reason for movies is to entertain. You want enlightenment, go read a book or watch a documentary on the subject.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but he is excellent in roles where he is being pushed by unseen forces. He's able to create a level of tension that is believable. For proof of this, doubters can go watch The Firm, as well as the first and best Mission Impossible."

","I enjoy War-type movies because they usually are based on true wars or stories and I am definitely into action. This movie was absolutely amazing, the only thing I might have changed was have all their accents the same - However,I like how it started out with Tom Cruise(Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg) speaking German and then it shifting into English (like the Red October).<br/><br/>It was amazing how this movie got to not only me, but the people in the theater as well. You know from the start that they would die, since unfortunately no assassination attempts against Hitler prevailed, but it just gets to you every time when they are executed as ""traitors"" to Germany. It is astonishing how much courage these men had to stand up to Hitler and the Nazis, knowing death was basically it if they failed. And yet, when they were taken to be killed they all died honorably. When Haeften turned his back to the squad as an act of defiance and to show his respect for Stauffenberg, the audience in the theater I was in reacted emotionally. When you see a movie, you need something that will impact the audience and Valkyrie did. But when Colonel Stauffenberg cried ""Long live Sacred Germany"" before he was shot, I liked how his words got to the firing squad. His last act of defiance was telling them that it was not Hitler's Germany."
"mcw2112","10","2","3","9 August 2009"," Good film...Cruise should do more like this...
","Valkyrie, starring Tom Cruise, is the true story of World War II German army officer, Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, one of many German army officers who saw that Hitler's war was not only a suicidal one, but one that could ultimately bring about the destruction of the whole of Europe. Von Stauffenberg, like many of his fellow conspirators, believed that if Hitler could be assassinated, the Allies could be negotiated with and perhaps Germany could be saved from defeat and hopefully, untold destruction.<br/><br/>It is 1943 and the German army is taking a pounding from all sides; losses of life and machinery are piling up and the Allies are showing no signs of weakening. Stauffenberg is in cahoots with several officers; Major-General Henning Von Tresckow(Kenneth Branagh), General Friedrich Olbricht(Bill Nighy), and the nervous, reluctant General Erich Fellgiebel (Eddie Izzard), along with retired General Ludwig Beck (Terrance Stamp) and The hopefully soon-to-be new leader of Germany, Dr. Carl Goerdeler (Kevin McNally). The plan is to sneak a bomb into one of Hitler's high-level meetings, kill the Fuhrer, round up the SS with the troops serving as the reserve guard, and with any luck, put a new government in place before anyone knows what has happened. It would be a very risky coup' and everything had to fall into place in order for it to be a success. One major stumbling block is General Friedrich Fromm(Tom Wilkinson), who is the man that would have to give the order to put Operation Valkyrie into effect, essentially mobilizing the in-country reserves and taking control of the government and the armed forces. He is aware of the plan but is quite on the fence about the whole matter. There is a scene where he tells Von Stauffenberg and General Olbricht in no uncertain terms, that he will stand on whatever side the victors are on. He will not sacrifice life, limb or his position unless the deal has already gone down and the conspirators are successful. This puts the pressure on the entire rest of the plan going off without a hitch, and most notably, Von Staffenberg's ability to makes sure Hitler is in fact dead.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the plot failed in the end, but that does not diminish the tension of the story and even though we know how things come out, the sheer fact of the risks these men were willing to take, makes for a riveting film. These men are, and should be, remembered as heroes; men who were far more loyal to the nation of Germany than to the chain of command that of course ended with Hitler at the top. They were true patriots that believed that the fate of the fatherland was doomed if Hitler remained in control, and were intent on stopping a madman from taking everyone down with him. Von Stauffenberg has been a loyal soldier, even losing an eye, his right hand and several fingers of his left hand in battle, but he knows all too well that if his children are to ever know peace in their lifetimes, Hitler must not be allowed to continue his self-destructive rampage into oblivion.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is a well made film, focusing on the mechanics of the plot and the passion of the conspirators. These are men that have an abiding love of their country and know that if they fail, they will all certainly be executed and their families would be in peril as well. Cruise, while not my favorite actor, does two things very well in movies: he does cocky well and he does intense well. Here he is required to be intense and pulls it off well. Cruise plays Von Stauffenberg as a man who cares deeply about his family and the future of his country. He is a man that has given a lot to his country, including bits of his body. The one thing he will not part with, however, is his soul. He knows that in the grand scheme of things, his life is a small price to pay to bring his beloved Germany back from the brink. Cruise plays Von Stauffenberg as a cool customer; professional and reserved and determined.<br/><br/>Branagh's Von Tresckow is seen only periodically throughout the film, but he is one of the key conspirators. Branagh plays Von Tresckow as a confident, thoughtful man, who like Von Stauffenberg, is close enough to Hitler's inner circle to see his insanity and to fear it. After placing a bomb concealed in a drink bottle on Hitler's plane (a bomb that does not go off), he calmly retrieves the bomb from one of Hitler's aides, saying it was given to him by mistake. Not knowing if anyone was wise to him, he plays it as smoothly as if he were in no danger at all.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy's General Olbricht is scared right out of his wits about the whole plot, but bravely pushes forward, showing that he is a man of honor, but still just a man.<br/><br/>The sets are as much of a character as any of the actors and everything looks stately and grand, just as it did in the 'glory' days of the Third Reich. This is a very authentic looking film, and the uniforms look more like uniforms than costumes, something you don't always get to see in movies. Also, David Bamber did a chillingly creepy version of Adolf Hitler, maintaining the presence of a complicated, detached madman.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer has portrayed these men in a very honorable, ethical manner and has done real justice to their memories. The plot unfolds with time line titles and clear direction. We collectively hold our breaths watching the events unfold, understanding what is at stake and what is to come. These truly were honorable men, and although they failed, history would bear them out to be the heroes that they were."

"Pincha89","9","2","3","1 March 2009"," Hitler's Death??? Although we know the truth... Suspense...
","When I saw the trailers of this movie that was coming, I had no doubts that movie was going to be Very Good or at least good. Why? Because the great director, Brian Singer and the actors that were chosen. Also the Academy Award winner Cristopher McQuarrie was an incentive to see the film and we see his marvelous work in it. My point is: We know Hitler die in 1945, not in 1944 and that his death was due to suicide, not to an assassination. So, we maybe expect a boring movie with only a little suspense and a lot of historic dates and facts. But, in ""Valkyrie"", the thing is too different. Until the final we forget all we know about the World War II. We really believe Hitler's going to be murdered by that plot against him and we learn quite a lot of this plot in its context. That's the true value during all the film. We are gaining suspense and more suspense... And, in the end, while getting out the cinema, we realize that we saw a very dynamic/entertaining movie with action and uncertainty, with history involved. All that beginning from a known fact (Hitler's suicide), a known final... Or not??? That's the magic of the films: The suspense, the dynamism, the drama... Even if we know their end."
"turk_rooster","7","2","3","28 February 2009"," War of Conscience
","What makes Valkyrie clearly stand out from the common or garden Third Reich movie is the depiction of the careful build-up and execution of a plot where a majority of the participants are engaged throughout in a zone of ambiguity where while they are fairly sure of what to believe in, they are not clear about what their role in the same should be. Apart from the clear ideology of von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), the indecision of the likes of Olbricht (Bill Nighy) and the ostensible undying allegiance to the Fuehrer from the likes of Fromm (Tom Wilkinson), make for immense viewing pleasure. In the end, this is a movie set in war where there is not a single genuine battle scene, just the air raids in different circumstances  with his troops and with family respectively  that reinforce in von Stauffenberg his belief in the futility of it all. Rather, this movie is all about strong and carefully constructed character portrayals of a set of distinct individuals who chose to differ from the establishment, but in their own separate ways"
"SophomoreSlump","8","2","3","24 February 2009"," Another Movie in Bryan Singer's Line of Masterpieces
","The movie starts off with an introduction speech by Stauffenberg (Cruise) in perfect German. It is then slowly phased into English. Then, after the attack that cost Stauffenberg his fingers, right hand and eye, we were headed for a crash course of who's whom and what's what in Hitler's Germany, all the way until the closing execution scene.<br/><br/>Most people, I'm sure, had already known the ending to this based-on-history movie. But the question to ask while watching Valkyrie is not ""What happened in the end?"" but instead, ""What went wrong?"" The movie shows us what was the flaw of Operation Valkyrie and why no one killed Hitler but himself.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer got everything spot on. The tension and intensity of the film is there. You will feel the suspense even if you had already memorized the WWII history. One thing that I found peculiar was how Singer depicts Hitler, not as a mad man with murderous intention and hatred, but as pure evil. Whenever he is on screen, everything felt dead silent, sombre and dark. Starting from the first scene he's in all the way to the last phone call scene, in which we do not even see his face but just hear his voice.<br/><br/>This is the kind of mood that I'm sure we'd feel if we were in that era. And this is the way a good director interpret a scene.<br/><br/>But, what went wrong with Valkyrie as in, the movie? Well, the cast. Everyone did their job well, I can give you that. But it seems that everyone could have top it up a notch. The accent was all over the place and it looks like no one was living as their characters.<br/><br/>Other than that, Valkyrie is a well made movie. The directing and editing was well played, and the script and tone of the movie was anything a well-made movie should have.<br/><br/>Valkyrie shall forever remain in director Bryan Singer's unbroken line of masterpieces."
"richard-hodges","8","2","3","10 February 2009"," Fine drama
","A short time ago, I watched a fine New Zealand made drama called ""Until Proved Innocent"". A good story, well told, about a man in jail for a crime he didn't commit. It's real potency though, for me, was undone by the fact that I knew the outcome. It was all over the news. Couldn't help it. There's nothing the filmmakers can do about this of course, and not everyone will be bothered about knowing the ending. In this instance, I suppose, it was all about the means, rather than the end.<br/><br/>Many a drama is let down, isn't it, by giving the game away too early and a great movie can fall off the rails in the final twenty minutes. Can I think of a good example. 'course not, but they exist, and the point here is, happily, Valkyrie is not one of them.<br/><br/>It tells the story of an assassination attempt on German leader Adolf Hitler in 1944 bu a group of patriotic nationalists (not Nazis) fearful that their Fuhrer will irrevocably destroy not only their homeland and it's people but Europe as well (if he hadn't already).<br/><br/>Not everyone will know Hitler's eventual fate in a bunker 8 months after the events in Valkyrie took place. and for those, the dramatic effect will be amplified. I knew the end and it didn't matter at all. What I didn't know how we were going to get there. Here, it is all about the journey. The plot, the players, the setbacks, the failure, the fallout and finally the fates of those involved. Like a rail trip through the alps. So much to enjoy en route.<br/><br/>And just where ""Until Proved Innocent"" lacked real dramatic thwack, Valkyrie has enough tension to press the most relaxed individual into breathing exercises.<br/><br/>Some of the lead performances teeter on the edge of melodrama, but this is a minor quibble at most. Tom Cruise is fine, but he is of course, Tom Cruise. Not his fault, and as usual, he does deliver the goods, but it does make a portrayal of German officer Colonel Stauffenberg more difficult to grab in a film of this dramatic ilk. Wilkinson, Stamp and Branagh do what is required, but the real stars are the supporting cast whose various turns evoke great sympathy of people torn between duty and honour in crazy times."
"Otoboke","Null","2","3","5 February 2009"," Swap the name Hitler with Lex Luthor and you have yourself a thrilling ride.
","When it comes to World War II, there are undoubtedly a myriad of different stories to be told, whether from the front-lines of the war itself or from those left back home. It goes without saying then that such an entertainment industry which thrives upon compelling situations thriving with drama and action would be foolish not to capitalise on such a historical, iconic and memorable piece of history which was, regrettably, brimming with such qualities. Such has been Hollywood's claim for many a year now, throwing out broad examples of tales from the front-lines of war, some which do justice to the horrors of those years, some of which only seem to belittle.<br/><br/>Valkyrie then, with its stars and creators rooted in popcorn fodder action movies at first comes off more aligned to the latter. It's sophomoric in its historical significance; facile, kitsch and watered down for the sake of telling a thrilling story and yet if taken strictly on a fictional base, at least does so formidably. On this ground I feel somewhat divided; on the one hand Valkyrie uses it's ""true story"" to evoke feelings from the audience that a film dealing with fabricated events (although, one could argue McQuarrie & Alexander's script to be more a work of fairytale than fact) would have to establish from the ground up; and yet there's also the undeniable truth that Singer and co do a brilliant job of telling a compelling and well constructed story full of high tension action and suspense. In the end, I had to let go my reservations for Valyrie's attempt at providing a historical account set to enlighten and instead imagine I was watching Mission Impossible set in 1940's Germany.<br/><br/>Whether or not this evokes any reaction from audiences is a matter of speculation only on the part of myself, but I really can't see it irking much more viewers any more than it did myself. Granted, during the first act of the feature I was troubled with Tom Cruise and his über-Americano stature- which in turn negates any sense of engrossment within the story's supposed deep rooted truth- yet as the movie goes on and things begin to be put in place, Valkyrie moves on from caricature impressionism into an engaging form of entertainment; the historical backing in turn becomes redundant, and sure, this spoils the aforementioned pre-connection to the story itself, but swap the name Hitler with Lex Luthor and you have yourself a thrilling ride regardless of all the uniforms and salutes.<br/><br/>So who then is our Superman- our Ethan Hunt perhaps? Well of course that comes in form of Tom Cruise under the guise of Claus von Stauffenberg, a colonel disillusioned by Hitler's war. Opening the feature with perhaps its only reel of German dialogue, Stauffenberg ridicules Hitler's war and demeans it to the point of embarrassment; there's no denying that this colonel isn't alone, and that's exactly what Valkyrie sets out to explore. From here the movie attempts to convey the idea that not all Germans were saluting national socialists bending to the whim of their Führer; indeed, there were many who directly opposed his reign and wanted him stripped of control- to free Germany of Hitler would mean freeing his people of absolute disaster in the eyes of their opposed forces. It's no surprise then that much of Valkyrie dabbles in and out of the building cascade of rebellion from those initiating the now infamous ""Valkyrie"" operation, detailing the intrinsic planning and implementation required to pull such an attempt to assassinate and cut off the head of Germany's war machine.<br/><br/>For the most part, particularly throughout the movie's latter acts, Valkyrie tells a compelling and rigorous story of espionage and political plotting; the tension riding high during the movie's biggest scenes- some of which providing excellent visuals complementing the bubbling suspense underneath. Granted, there are many instances which only work to belittle both Singer's movie and the facts it is based upon themselves, but such moments are far and few between the greater, more viscerally adoptive ones. Cruise, who admittedly feels out of place within the feature's opening sequences, does well to transform as he does in his greatest roles, disappearing completely behind his persona to great effect. The same unfortunately cannot be said for a few supporting cast members, yet with such a large ensemble, this doesn't prove too much to put up with.<br/><br/>Conclusively, despite a few reservations about the movie's willingness for you to submit to the script's supposed foothold in fact, Valkyrie at the very least provides a decently paced and constructed story that will disgruntle historians but please those looking for a good story. Of course there are a myriad of problems, most of which occur during the film's opening, stultifying act, but if taken with a grain of forgiveness, Cruise, Singer and co do well to keep you firmly in your seat to see where it all goes wrong for Stauffenberg and his ever hopeful rebels with a cause. More Mission Impossible than Der Untergang or Saving Private Ryan, Valkyrie is a fine and riveting effort plagued by the very historical setting to which it subscribes to; World War II it seems is a playground for film-makers with ideas of grandeur and yet Singer here constantly feels like he should stick to the pages of comic books rather than those of solidified history.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"jackk2786","7","2","3","3 February 2009"," The Cruise-ual Suspects
","Most thrillers rely on a sense of mystery, that is the point of them - to thrill the audience to the edge of their seats wondering ""what is going to happen next?"" So how do you build a thriller around a story of which the audience knows the outcome right from the start? This is the case with Valkyrie, based on the conspiracy to kill Hitler by a group of his own Nazi generals, and I don't think any journalistic codes of ethics are being broken when I tell you that the plot fails. Not only that, but the film has been plagued by pre-release rumours and speculation about everything from test audiences panning it to critics writing it off before they had even seen it simply because Tom Cruise doesn't attempt a German accent. However, from this has been crafted a tense, engrossing war thriller.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer is back in the territory of his breakthrough film, The Usual Suspects: a group of plotters involved in a plan in which everything goes horrifyingly wrong. Throughout his career, from Suspects to first two X-Men movies (i.e. the good ones) and Superman Returns, Singer has never made a dud, so why pundits thought it would end up being so is probably the biggest mystery of the entire film. Along with the likes of Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson, Singer is one of the best in the business at shepherding an ensemble cast, and the way he does so here is one of the film's major strengths. He works masterfully in introducing us to the major figures in the plot, allowing us to tell them apart, explaining their roles and suggesting their differences and, to his credit, never allows proceedings to simply deteriorate into a star vehicle for Cruise, who provides a perfectly fine anchor for the story to centre around (say what you will about Tom, no one does defiant heroism like him).<br/><br/>The taut and crisply paced direction is aided in no small way by the skilfully efficient screenplay (from Nathan Alexander and Usual Suspects writer Christopher McQuarrie). The film is built around the idea that the biggest plans revolve around the tiny details, and it spares none of them yet still manages to make such a complex story coherent and seem almost straightforward. However, this almost complete submission to the plot does sacrifice attention to the characters.<br/><br/>Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg, the man who engineered the entire plan, is clearly an interesting and complex character  a career military man and a Nazi who is willing to risk everything, even the safety of his own family, to kill Hitler, yet Tom Cruise never has the opportunity to play him as anything but intense and determined. We see the group discuss the morality of murdering Hitler rather than simply overthrowing him and whether the risk of the plot is worth it with the Allied forces looming over Belin, but we never find out why Stauffenberg, or any of the other members of the conspiracy, have gone from Nazi generals to deciding to rid themselves of their Führer. Although maybe the audience's own knowledge of history is supposed to fill in those plot points for us. Who needs a ""reason"" for wanting to murder Adolf Hitler?<br/><br/>With this knowledge of history in mind, it is perhaps surprising that the greatest success of Valkyrie is that there are still genuine twists. The makers of the film have been blessed with the fact that the details of the plot are still relatively obscure, so although we know that the bomb intended to kill Hitler did not succeed, it is the aftermath of this sequence which is the most intriguing. The plot fails at about the halfway point of the story, and I guarantee that everything that takes place afterwards will be news to you, and that despite yourself, you will end up on the edge of your seat wondering how it is going to end.<br/><br/>For more of this review or reviews like it, visit:<br/><br/>jacksfilmblog at blogspot.com"
"sinncross","8","2","3","1 February 2009"," An interesting idea backed by a top cast...
","Colonel Stuaffenberg (Tom Cruise) is one of the few men in the Nazi party who feel that their leader, Adolf Hitler (David Bamber), is more a threat to German instead of her saviour. He regrets the oath he took for Hitler and feels a desire to help Germany in any way possible. When a surprise attack on a German camp in Tunisia leaves Stuaffenberg seriously wounded, he becomes recruited into a group bent on killing Hitler at any cost.<br/><br/>While based upon real-life events, Valkyrie's soul is that of an action thriller and not a biopic. This is not to say that director Bryan Singer skews history but he merely doesn't try to authenticate the film in its entirety. The most obvious claim to this would be the lack of German accents from the main cast. Besides the German introduction from Cruise, all major characters keep their American or British accents intact. This is by no means problematic for the film, and many other greats have been in the same boat. A recent example is The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas: a stellar film where the cast was easily identifiably for their strong English accents even though they were German. The fact of the manner is, is that authentic accents would not enhance either films' core message, with Valkyrie's being about bravery in an unforgiving situation. <br/><br/>The story itself follows a fairly consistent flow with the odd moment being stretched out far longer then it ought to be or a story segment which is not developed enough, such as the lack of screen time to develop the relationship between Stauffenberg and his wife Nina (Carice van Houten) and their children. That said, it should be noted that there is an obvious lack of true twists in the story, unless you have no idea about Operation Valkyrie, but this forms a truly impressive feat from Singer, the story and the actors: there is a genuine feel in the film that there is a chance that Stuaffenberg could actually succeed and this only heightens the suspense.<br/><br/>The acting front is laden with experience and it shows. Cruise proves commendable as his role as Stuaffenberg and expresses the same level of vigour he has shown many films before. He is not the most ideal candidate but that does not stop him. However Cruise does have the rare weak moment where his delivery of a certain line comes across as stiff and out of character. The British cast is simply fantastic and virtually faultless. The likes of Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighly and Tom Wilkinson bring a level of believability to the film that could have otherwise been lost and their presence is easily felt. Smaller, though not unimportant, roles go to von Houten, who shows a real sense of love for Stuaffenberg, and Bamber, who is just as every inch as creepy and menacing as the infamous Hitler himself. As noted, the entire cast is impressive and lift the film as a whole.<br/><br/>The music ensemble, while not overly memorable, supports the film at all times. The direction is no different. Bryan Singer brings a neat fluidity to the scenes which help the film's pacing but it is evident that he is not confident to allow the story or characters speak for themselves in many situations, and instead of being subtle, prefers to make sure the audience understands everything as it happens. In this respect the film loses much of its intrigue and naturalness.<br/><br/>Sex and nudity play no part in the film's proceedings with language being brief, if not strong on the odd occasion. Action sequences show off the violent content but there are far and few, never graphic and is comprises mainly of firearms with a suicide scene.<br/><br/>Valkyrie can be considered Tom Cruise's return to cinema, and thankfully the end result is a positive one. He is backed up by a decent storyline and a superb selection of actors. Sure the film could have used with some better pacing, more depth and subtlety; and the lack of German accents do possibly ruin the experience if you allow it to do so, but these problems do not hurt the film in any serious manner. Valkyrie might lack the literary impact to allow it to be phenomenal, but that does not stop it being watchable and exciting."

","I was initially extremely skeptical due to the film's negative reception from film critics. I was also extremely skeptical of Tom Cruise, not to mention the film itself. I was completely turned off by the multiple times this film's release date was bumped back. This is surely a sign of a struggling, failing film, right? No. I am pleased to report that the film was absolutely fantastic. It completely delivered and left me satisfied - and thinking - for days after the viewing.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is fantastic - many of the actors are actual Germans who act in German film (see ""Downfall,"" etc.). Tom Cruise's performance is potent and believable. All of the characters seem to ""just work"" on screen together. The characters and the performances all seem to contribute to an unrelenting sense of tension throughout the film.<br/><br/>Although the outcome of the plot is well known, I found myself clenching my fists and cheering for the ""good guys"" throughout the entire film. You cannot help but find yourself identifying with the emotions and tensions on screen. There are many points during the film where the tension becomes almost too much to bear. It's times like these when you know you've found a good film - a good thriller - and a good drama. The film delivers fully in every aspect.<br/><br/>The film even delivers in the historical accuracy arena - it is obvious that much work went into portraying the story in a historically accurate light. If you're a nitpicker, you're bound to find inaccuracies in any film; however, if you're a history buff that enjoys an excellent reenactment with a nice mix of drama, this film is for you.<br/><br/>I would ignore the critics on this one - I think Tom Cruise has left a sour taste in their mouths. Instead, give this film a try and I promise you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is a well-rounded, tense drama that leaves the viewer thinking long after the film is over.

","Operation Walküre was the last known attempt to overthrow the Nazi party, immediately stop National Socialism and assassinate the Third Reich himself, Adolf Hitler. An emergency continuity of government operations that planned to roll out Germany's Reserve Army to implement order in case of chaos ensuing the nation. Various German military officers however, were able to acquire the original plan and make certain amendments. These alterations would assist the attached conspirators in regaining control of German cities, the disarmament of the Schutzstaffel and the arrest of Nazi leadership. Yet these could only be actioned dependant on the successful assassination of Hitler.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, as history would indicate to us, the plan was unsuccessful. However, that does not prevent Singer from re-telling the implementation of Walküre and highlighting the significance of painting various Nazi officials as morally conflicted humans. Colonel von Stauffenberg, having been severely injured during an air raid of P-40 fighter-bombers, rapidly became disillusioned with the future of a country he was once proud of. Him and various other military officials, including General Beck, General Olbricht and Dr. Goerdeler, questioned the tyranny that Hitler envenomated Europe with. And so, the proposition to utilise Operation Walküre in an attempt to overthrow the Nazi party was swiftly commissioned. This included the infamous July 20 plot, von Stauffenberg's assassination attempt by planting a detonation device within Hitler's Eastern Front military headquarters, ""The Wolf's Lair"".<br/><br/>Valkyrie can simply be surmised in one word: solid. Much like the concrete foundations that the Nazi party believed their ideologies were constructed upon, Valkyrie's cold and meticulous approach works both in its favour and detriment. For the uninitiated, Valkyrie provides an important history lesson in World War II politics. War depictions, especially those manufactured in Hollywood, tend to bend the truth to insert some level of overburdening national patriotism. Singer, along with McQuarrie's conscientious screenplay, avoids that by embracing the history of Walküre, despite a few historical inaccuracies littered throughout. Audiences should know the outcome of Valkyrie even before deciding to watch the feature or not. It's history, and everyone should know the climactic events of the Second World War. McQuarrie precariously utilises the inevitability of Walküre's failure to embody a sympathetic motive within these characters. Culminating in a solemn third act that embellishes Stauffenberg's final cry. ""Long live sacred Germany!"".<br/><br/>The preceding conversations of proposed political manipulation and operation planning, whilst succinctly entertaining, were monotonous throughout. The narrative's pace had no peaks or troughs. The re-enactment of the July 20 plot failed to conjure up any tension, as did the initial battalion attack. The story's inevitability could assign itself as the culprit, however it's more adorned to McQuarrie's minimal characterisation of von Stauffenberg that plagued its potential. The stellar British supporting cast, including Nighy, Wilkinson and Branagh, were able to fluctuate with their emotions. Nighy in particular was able to transition from professional stability to overwhelming frustration, all in a matter of seconds. Cruise (regardless of the Scientology protests...) was somewhat miscast, despite his profile resemblance to the real individual he was portraying. The stoic yet vigorous persona he opted for unfortunately weakened the gentile moments with his family, often exuding unconvincing emotional output. Again, the resonant third act redeems all these qualms, it just takes two thirds of a feature to connect with von Stauffenberg as a human. Honourable, albeit paper-thin. Also Hitler's portrayal, with Singer implementing low camera angles and a multitude of shadows, likened him to a Bond villain. Unusual to say the least.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Valkyrie is solid. Its slick production design, wholesome historical accuracy and competent supporting cast made this operation a successful depiction of rebellious Nazis. Frustratingly the central performance, one-note narrative tone and thinly detailed characterisation failed to explore the conflicting morality of military officials. The inner debate between right and wrong. Surmounting to the consequential question of ""what if...?""."

If I wanted to see a factual straight by the numbers film, I would have probably preferred watching documentary because this felt bland although it revolves around a serious and important issue and people that shouldn't be forgotten for their efforts. Tom Cruise did a fine job as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg who was one of the pioneer of the Coup d'état in order to get rid of a sadistic tyrant. Not a noteworthy role for Tom Cruise but he does carry this film to a certain degree. It's just that Bryan Singer is the wrong director to direct this film that had the potential to be great. He should probably stick to more of the fictitious films over a film that needs intelligent build ups and more depth to it.

"GusF","Null","1","1","4 October 2015"," A gripping thriller which maintains a high level of tension and foreboding throughout
","A largely historically accurate account of the failed 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, this is a very effective thriller which maintains a high level of tension and foreboding throughout. The very good script by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander has a nice eye for historical detail and respects the audience's intelligence while Bryan Singer directs the film with his usual flair. At 1 hour and 50 minutes, the film is not especially long and it rollicks along at a very brisk pace.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a modern day John Wayne in that he is a great film star as opposed to a great actor but he is perfectly fine as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a man of great courage, honour and resourcefulness who is recruited into the German Resistance in 1943 and becomes one of the leading figures in the plot to save Germany from Nazism. Even before the war, von Stauffenberg was dubious of the Nazis and these feelings became more pronounced as he learned of their atrocities. He is able to cut through the constant arguments that are besetting his co-conspirators and convinces them of the necessity of cutting off the snake's head rather than attacking its tail. He has a clarity of vision which makes him the perfect person to lead the operation. His assumption that Hitler has been killed in the explosion at the Wolf's Lair is based not on wishful thinking but on a reasoned and perfectly logical conclusion based on the evidence that he could not have survived, though one which unfortunately turned out to be incorrect.<br/><br/>Although he is credited second, Kenneth Branagh has little more than a glorified cameo as General Henning von Tresckow but he is extremely good in the role. Bill Nighy gives the best performance in the film as General Friedrich Olbricht, whose neurotic behaviour and indecision causes many problems for the Resistance. In spite of this, he is depicted as a good man but one who would probably not have been allowed to play such a significant role in the plot due to his unsuitable personal traits if the Resistance had had more options at their disposal. Tom Wilkinson is excellent as the ""careerist pig"" Friedrich Fromm who becomes involved in the plot out of love for himself rather than out of hatred for the Nazis. Kevin McNally is suitably unctuous as Carl Goerdeler, a more antagonistic figure in the film than in reality who would have become Chancellor of Germany had the plot succeeded. Terence Stamp brings a great deal of quiet dignity to the role of the would-be President Ludwig Beck, who displays great wisdom and integrity in all of his scenes.<br/><br/>Out of the supporting cast, I was very impressed by David Bamber as Hitler (who, wisely, is kept off-screen for the most of the film, making only brief appearances), Jamie Parker as Lt. von Haeften, Carice von Houten as von Stauffenberg's wife Nina (who died only two and a half years before the film was released), Thomas Kretschmann as Otto Remer (an infamous postwar Holocaust denier), Christian Berkel as Colonel von Quirnheim, Kenneth Cranham as Field Marshal Keitel and Tom Hollander as Colonel Brandt, a major thorn in the conspirators' side for most of the film who unwittingly saved Hitler's life at the cost of his own when he moved the briefcase containing the bomb. It also features nice small appearances by Bernard Hill, Danny Webb, Chris Larkin, David Schofield and Ian McNeice. However, I thought that Eddie Izzard was a very odd choice for Fellgiebel, though he does try his best.<br/><br/>The aborted 15 July attempt on Hitler's life is not depicted in an entirely accurate fashion but, had it been carried out then, it may have had a better chance of success. I can't help but wonder how the Allies would have reacted if the plot had been successful in assassinating Hitler. I'd be interested in reading an alternate history novel on the subject. The use of Operation Valkyrie to seize control of the government was a brilliant idea which could very well have worked if Hitler had been killed. I thought that the film did a very good job of portraying the confusion that plagued both sides in the hours after the bomb was detonated, particularly as regards whether Hitler was alive or dead. He was basically Schrödinger's Führer! <br/><br/>Overall, this is a gripping thriller which depicted the events surrounding the 20 July plot and the individuals who laid down their lives to enact it with a great deal of admiration and respect."

Way too often, there seemed to be no natural movement happening with any of the actors. Their overall actions all seemed to be stiff and unnatural, as if director Bryan Singer, had placed each one of then, just so, on his own little ""X"" on the set and then ordered them not to move, even an inch.<br/><br/>I know that the intentions of this film were probably meant well, but, unfortunately, VALKYRIE's story, about high treason, conspiracy, and betrayal, set during WW2 in Germany, left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Yes, Back in 1944 Hitler may have been the arch-enemy of the world, but the way that he was presented here in VALKYRIE, as a literal fumbling and feeble non-entity, I would've never believed that for a single, solitary minute.<br/><br/>As far as WW2 pictures go, VALKYRIE was good, but, definitely, not great film-making."

","I'd hate to think my mind had been worn to a nubbin by exposure to headlong action movies with exploding fireballs every few minutes and impossible physical feats generated by computers, but this one, though never confusing, seemed like a rather sluggish film. Maybe my synapses HAVE fused.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is the maimed Colonel von Stauffenberg, scion of an old aristocratic family, who joins a number of other prominent German officers and politicians after the Normandy invasion in a plot, first to usurp Hitler's power, then, later, to blow him up and take over to negotiate a peace with the Allies.<br/><br/>I can imagine that most of it -- not all -- sticks to the historical facts. But in some odd way that's hard to pin down, it lacks spark and tension. The story of Rommel's involvement, in ""The Desert Fox"", was at least as gripping as this, though less authentic.<br/><br/>Let me take one scene as an example -- when Cruise is first introduced to Hitler. Hitler is having a meeting with Goebels and Goering and the rest of the Black Rebels Motorcycle Club. Cruise is announced, enters, and stands silently at attention at the far end of the room. There is no conversation among the half-dozen others seated in easy chairs across the room. The camera gives us a close up of the back of Hitler's head before he slowly turns to look at Cruise. It aims at the dramatic, yet the power of the scene is kneecapped by its very presentation. The other figures sit as in a tableau, absolutely motionless, wearing slight frowns. Hitler rises as if with lumbago and shuffles over to Cruise to mumble something to him.<br/><br/>There is a complete absence of verve. The director is practically shouting at the viewer -- ""Feel AWED!"" But the scene is dull. In real life, we wouldn't expect a handful of powerful men to be sitting in silence and staring at one another. We'd expect conversation of some sort, even an occasional chuckle, no matter what the import of the meeting. ""Die Wannseekonferenz"" was about a meeting that determined the ""final solution"", the mass murder of Jews and other undesirables, and it lost none of its grip by allowing the figures at the meeting to act like humans instead of cardboard figures.<br/><br/>All in all, it's pretty slow going, although it's informative in many respects. None of the details seem to be skipped or simplified. I can believe the incidents as they take place on screen. And the performances aren't bad, given that the characters are so limited. It might have been a better movie if the director had asked his talent to relax and remember they're playing ordinary organisms who can be tickled into laughter.<br/><br/>I should add that I didn't watch the last quarter hour or so. I knew what had happened and was worried that the film might become too graphic. That was about the last thing I needed."

","""Valkyrie"" is a gripping suspense film that had my stomach in knots for most of its running time - I must surely be a masochist to enjoy this kind of pain! Director Bryan Singer brings an ""incident"" from the dying days of the Third Reich to the big screen with thoughtfulness, craftsmanship and style. We are plunged into the centre of a coup d'etat and its suffocating paranoia. Not since ""Seven Days in May"" (about an attempted military coup in the U.S.) have I seen a film that handles this type of subject matter so adroitly. ""Valkyrie"" is a thriller that actually thrills. I had the pleasurable feeling that, for once, I was watching a real ""movie movie"", to quote the late esteemed film critic, Pauline Kael.<br/><br/>The cast is solid. Not only Tom Cruise (who takes many risky parts and who does solid work here), but the likes of Bill Nighy, Kevin Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, all of whom bring real authority to their characters. Herr Hitler, as played by an actor named David Bamber, seems not quite ""all there"", and not quite in charge either - more a brand name than a commander of millions. I started thinking about power and my belief that you only have it with the consent of those around you, people with a vested interest. When the film takes us inside Hitler's inner sanctum, populated by smug, sycophantic generals, like lions between feeding frenzies, the atmosphere is stifling.<br/><br/>There's considerable attention to detail and apparent authenticity in the look of the film. This is the first film I've seen set in Nazi Germany that gives us a broad view of what Imperial Berlin, in all its modern architectural glory, might have looked like. Julius Caesar would have felt right at home. In fact, ""Valkyrie"" has a Roman Epic feel to it - ""Quo Vadis"" without the dancing girls, but fully loaded with conspiracies, power struggles, renegade generals, troop movements, and a mad emperor."

This is not an action thriller, it's a carefully plotted suspense thriller, that moves slowly but surely with a great buildup to it, well some of the time anyway. My big gripe with Valkyre was I didn't get enough information as to why Stauffenberg was so intent on destroying Hitler. I mean I knew why, but I was really hoping for more emphasis on that, that's why I was so disappointed, even though I enjoyed many bits of it. The ending is not a fun one, in fact it's very powerful and saddening, it will hit you that's for sure.<br/><br/>Bottom line.

","I have to start this review with an honest confession. I think that Tom Cruise is an appalling actor, with laughable technique, minute personality and no talent whatsoever. There I said it. Then why see this movie? First I am an history buff, and secondly the marvelous cast of brilliant British actors, trying their best to support a man that earns 50 times more and can't act to save his life. The movie itself is a well done, above average caper. We all knew that Hitler wasn't assassinated, but the story kept our attention, and even managed to be somewhat suspenseful. Still, this is a sad example of a mediocre Hollywood star, one of many one trick ponies, looking pathetic in a company of great but under-respected peers."

","I don't consider myself a Tom Cruise fan, but he's appeared in a number of good films along the way. When I first heard about his involvement in this project, I had to scratch my head over the idea of his portraying a German military officer in World War II. Putting those thoughts aside while watching ""Valkyrie' today, I have to say that I wound up thoroughly engrossed in the story. Finally there's a film that conveys to what extent Adolf Hitler's own reputation was held to derision within large segments of the German military. You only get a brief flavor of that in other World War II films, ""Das Boot"" is one that immediately comes to mind. Considering the fanatical grip that The Fuerher held over all matters and thinking during this period, it would seem improbable that so many willing co-conspirators would have found each other to attempt such an assassination plot. Perhaps the more intriguing aspect of the story has to do with Stauffenberg's plan to utilize the German Reserve Army in implicating an SS coup attempt against Hitler. That idea was so much more masterful than simply carrying out the assassination itself. It was also surprising to see how far ahead of his superior officers Stauffenberg was in his thinking. The movie weaves all of these dynamic intricacies together in a way that makes for a tense and suspenseful experience. Supporting Cruise you have a formidable cast, all of whom provide credible portrayals befitting their roles in the covert mission. Overall, this was a great bit of history to put to the screen, skillfully presented in a way that provides an insight into just how much opposition there was to Hitler within his own command."

","Bryan Singer's new film,Valkyrie tells the story of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg,a German army officer who, in the world war two, planned and executed a plot to kill Adolf Hitler and save Germany. As part of his plan,Stauffenberg, arranged for the internal emergency measure, Operation: Valkyrie(hence the name of the film) to be changed to enable his fellows to seize control of Berlin after the assassination of the Fuhrer. The movie shows the efforts of Stauffenberg and others,the planning of the conspiracy,the contingencies, the several attempts to actually execute the plan and so on. Stauffenberg is played by Tom Cruise,who could perhaps have immersed himself in the character a little more but, nevertheless, did a good job. The ""look"" of the film; wardrobe,locations and infantry is amazing and feels very authentic. The fact that the characters speak English is expected,after all, this is an American film but, I don't think it hurt the movie at all,we all know this events took place in Germany and what is important here is the story that is being told, and a story can be told in many languages. The interesting thing about Valkyrie is that it shows a slightly different perspective of the Germans then most movies do on this subject.After all,there were,in fact,at the time, individuals who didn't agree with Hitler's politics and all the terrible things he did and who fought against it, or in this case, died trying.For everyone who's interested in this historical period,Valkyrie is a must see, and for those who don't have much knowledge about it, here is a change to learn a little more and see a different take on some of the events that occurred. <br/><br/>7/10"
"honorhorror","7","1","1","8 August 2009"," A good examination on a bad management case.
","Valkyrie is good in casting, scale, tension building, technical and historical details and a lot of other things. But, what caught my thought, which the movie intended to, was its perspectives.<br/><br/>There were a lot of ""hit on Hitler"" movies I saw in the past, all of which seemed to present purely in the heroic view of the main protagonist, and provided audiences with more sentimental bases for those brave men. Those movies were great hero movies, but wasn't as reflective as Valkyrie.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is a thriller told in many perspectives, none of which were melodramatic or overdone. The good thing about this presentation is that, we can evaluate the whole event as a management case. Using the basic management model taught in universities, we see there are a lot of holes in planning, organizing, leading and controlling of the operation. Basically, they needed to be more diligent to execute a plan as big as this. Tom Cruise gave a solid performance as the core manager Stauffenberg, who was a good soldier with a heart, but a bad assassin with too straight a mind. All the people involved in this high treason suffered from something similar. You just have to sigh for them that they could have gotten so many things more realistic. For instance, assassination on Hitler had to be double-checked, but wasn't. In order for the higher ranking officers and some certain army functions(telegraph centers) to take sides with them, they should at least have done more political works...... No need to mention the organization that kept falling apart.<br/><br/>I personally refused to accept the idea that it's some kind of providence that kept Hitler from being assassinated for 15 times. Maybe it's the movie Valkyrie that gave me some new ideas. Suddenly, it came to me that Stauffenberg and his staff was noble enough to be remembered in history, but not dirty or tactful enough to overthrow the Nazi government. It's 70 years later now. Are we seeing the big pictures so we won't make the mistake? I wonder."

","Tom Cruise plays the moral and righteous leader of a band of good Nazis who attempts to kill Hitler. Though slick and entertaining, ""Valkryie"" is just another in a long line of flicks which trivialize the Holocaust. After films like ""Boy in the Striped Pajamas"", ""Black Book"", ""The Reader"", ""The Pianist"", ""Schindler's List"" etc etc, it's hard to get worked up about yet another film about heroic Nazis.<br/><br/>More interesting are the little choices made in the film. For example, all the film's Nazis sport English accents and are played by seasoned British actors. This venerable tradition has been around for a long time, tainting our perception of bad guys to such an extent that even the Empire in ""Star Wars"" is populated by officers who speak with a refined upper class English accent. With World War 2 pictures, though, this choice has the odd effect of making the Nazis sound like the very same people they're trying to blow up. Imagine, in contrast, a film in which the Nazi villains sounded like the Sopranos or the Corleones. Or how about Tony Montana as an SS officer: ""Hitler? He da man! First you get da powa, then you get da wimmin, and then you get da concentration camps!""<br/><br/>And of course audiences respond only to pretty Nazis. Compare the well manicured Tom Cruise to Shirley Stoler, the ordinary yet strangely hideous prison commandant of Lina Wertmuller's ""Seven Beauties"". Such casting choices are too confusing for mainstream audiences.<br/><br/>But confusion is the very point. Nazis need to be portrayed as vaguely superior, aloof, pretty and refined. It's far more satisfying for us to vicariously defeat smart guys than evil dopes. This provide audiences with objects of guilt-free hatred and panders to our own class based insecurities.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this constant revisiting of the Holocaust via new and inventive narrative avenues is just an attempt to affix a happier ending onto one of the most horrifying episodes in human history. By locating and magnifying some morsel of human charity (""Schindler's List"", ""Valkyrie"" etc ) we are somehow led to believe that, even in the midst of a national murder spree, there was hope, kindness and humanity. It makes sense that an emotional anesthesiologist like Steven Spielberg would construct such a story. <br/><br/>Of course these approaches aren't necessarily problematic, it's just that ""Holocaust"" has rarely been successfully rendered as a tragedy. And so what we have with ""Valkyrie"" is another film about nobility and courage among perpetrators of great horror. It's another exercise in wish-fulfilment, just like ""Defiance"", another recent film which argues that if Europe's Jews had more guns and considerably more homicidal instinct, the entire Holocaust might have never happened. All these films are thus giant ""what ifs"". What if Cruise had succeeded in killing Hitler? What if Schindler had saved more Jews? What if there were more Good Germans? What if the Jews fought back? It's all a kind of fantasy, an attempt to shut doors, look away and avoid trauma. And it's this very lack of confrontation which perpetuates these horrors themselves (see ""The Shining""). <br/><br/>Perhaps the only way to treat the Holocaust serious is to approach it as a comedy. Laugh at Nazis and steal their power. Mel Brooks knew this, as did Lubitsch and Billy Wilder. Maybe Bryan Singer does too, because he has Tom Cruise dressed in an eye-patch and missing an arm for most of the picture. Cruise isn't just a ""good Nazi"", he's a German pirate as well.<br/><br/>7.9/10 – Slight, but Singer is a talented director and he's crafted a slick thriller here. I can't think of another mainstream movie that so deftly communicates a coup and political take over. See ""The Garden of the Finzi Continis"", ""Soldier Blue"", ""Hotel Terminus"" and ""The Shop on Main Street""."
"classicalsteve","10","1","1","17 July 2009"," Failed Heros Recognized: A Tour-de-Force Film About Fallen Heros -- The Film Is Its Own Valkyries, Raising Fallen Heros
","The word ""Walküre"" (aka Valkyrie in English) comes from German composer Richard Wagner's opera ""Die Walküre"", the third installment of his fantasy cycle ""The Ring of the Nibelung"". In Wagner's ""The Ring"", the Valkyries were winged maidens who fly to battlefields to raise fallen heroes and take them to the great sanctuary of Valhalla. Walküre was also the code-name for a military operation created by the German-Nazi regime to be enacted if Adolf Hitler suddenly died. Although the film itself refers to the word in the latter sense as a military-coup operation, the film is also a referendum on the fallen heroes who lost their lives trying to save Germany. ""Valkyrie"" the film becomes the Valkyries of these fallen heroes.<br/><br/>Certainly, when we think of the heroes of World War II, our minds conjure images of Roosevelt, Churchill, Patton, Eisenhower and Montgomery. But aside from the political leaders and military commanders, many civilians and lower-ranking military officers were involved in resistance movements in both France and Germany who wanted Hitler stopped. These people, many whose names have been lost to history, risked their lives to undermine the German-Nazi Regime that not only occupied many European countries but began persecuting and executing innocent people. ""Valkyrie"", starring Tom Cruise in his best role since ""Jerry Maguire"", Kenneth Branaugh (""Henry V"" by Shakespeare), and a host of notable supporting talent including Terence Stamp (General Zod of ""Superman"" I and II), and Tom Wilkinson (""Michael Clayton""), documents the last but most elaborate plot to assassinate Hitler before Germany and Austria would be devastated by the allied forces. And also save the remaining lives of people dying in concentration camps. They wanted to demonstrate that not all German citizens, both military and civilian, approved of Hitler's vision of Germany that included such inhumane intolerance.<br/><br/>The assassination and coup attempt was headed by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise), a decorated military officer who was loyal to Germany but detested Hitler's strategy and ultimately his ""final solution"" persecution of innocent civilians. Many of the events as portrayed in the movie actually occurred. When Stauffenberg loses a few limbs and an eye after one of his last military campaigns, he is seduced into joining a band of conspirators made up of high-ranking military and civilian personnel. The conspirators simply want to assassinate Hitler, but Stauffenberg points out that an assassination is not enough. A detailed military coup needs to be enacted, otherwise the highest-ranking members of the SS would simply take over the government where Hitler left off and continue the dictatorship.<br/><br/>Among the many detailed plans in the German Government is an operation known as Walküre (aka Valkyrie in English), a detailed military strategy that outlines how the government would continue in the event of the death of Adolf Hitler. Since Hitler was absolute dictator during the Nazi Regime, there were no constitutional guidelines for succession and/or transfer of power. The conspirators who want to oust Hitler through assassination decide to use the military's own plan to take control of the the government before the SS.<br/><br/>The film chronicles the debates between the conspirators, the assassination plan, and then the plan itself. The only minor criticism of the film is occasionally the conspirators are shown discussing their plots, sometimes only a room away from the Führer himself! Knowing that conspirators were often plotting, the German-Nazi regime would constantly watch and survey anyone and everyone for even the slightest inkling of disloyalty. Even those who were innocent but did not report suspicions quickly enough to authorities could find themselves under arrest. However, at other moments, the conspirators use coded language to indicate their intentions which seem much more realistic.<br/><br/>Overall an outstanding and compelling film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. One of the best films in recent memory, a tragic but honorable subject. The film details relatively accurately the actions of a small group of people willing to risk their lives to stand up to Hitler and show the world that not everyone in Germany would kill or be killed without question or pause. This film is for those people outside the allied forces who tried to right a terrible wrong. They lost the coup and their lives, but ultimately they won."

","Director Bryan Singer of X-Men and Usual Suspect's fame gives the viewer a smart and brilliantly acted thriller in Valkyrie. The film is based on the true story of a failed assassination attempt on Hilter by some of his own men. First of all the story is expertly executed and the writers clearly know what they are doing, the film flows very well and even though there is a lot of dialog and plot changes I was never confused. Bryan Singer has only directed a handful of films and this one by far shows his growth as a filmmaker, everything from the production design to the costumes is outstanding. I especially want to recognize the actors because everyone involved gave the best performance that was possible. The only flaw I can pick out in the film is that even though his performance was good I felt that Tom Cruise was to American for the part of a German officer. That is really the only negative thing I have to say about the film though, and I whole heartedly recommend this taut historical thriller."

","Historical thriller set in Nazi Germany directed by Bryan Singer and written by Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) based on the 1944 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Tom Cruise stars as one of the conspirators, Col Von Staffuenberg.<br/><br/>Coming out of the cinema, I can't understand the mediocre reviews this film has got. It's an excellent Conspiracy thriller that was very faithful to the actual events. Much more an ensemble piece rather than a ""Tom Cruise"" film (which I think is where most of the poor reviews have originated from) The tone is very similar to the TV movie Conspiracy (about the Wannsee conference where the Final Solution was drawn up) and features many of the same cast, who are all excellent throughout.<br/><br/>Very tensely and tightly directed by Bryan Singer, highly recommended. 10/10"

","In a film like this, there is really nothing to spoil because everyone knows how it would end. I watched the video of ""Valkyrie"" in several installments, but the flow of the story was no problem. The story being told was very interesting -- the plot to kill Adolf Hitler by German patriots led by Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) and its aftermath. The direction by Bryan Singer was very exciting and suspenseful, holding my interest successfully.<br/><br/>There were so many competent character actors there, not everyone was convincingly German though. My main problem with the whole movie is the lead actor himself, Tom Cruise. He is too much of a star to make his portrayal of von Stauffenberg convincing. Even with the eye-patch, he is still Tom Cruise. He did not disappear into the role, as would have been ideal for a movie like this."
"davegrover","8","1","1","6 June 2009"," Excellent WW2 Thriller
","I regret missing this one in the theater. Just saw it on blue-ray and its a fantastic. Singer & McQuarrie team up again and do one up on The Usual Suspects. As a thriller, it's pacing and suspense work seamlessly - never a dull moment. As WW2 genre picture, it's refreshing, as we're not watching typical Hollywood flag waving fair. The weight of the Nazi regime looms large and never has there been a better portrayal of Hitler and his senior advisers on film. If you are looking for loads of combat action like Saving Private Ryan, look elsewhere. The movie is not trying to wow you with effects as the story alone is interesting enough to stay tuned. One warning though, the pacing is very quick so be sure to pause the movie if you're getting a snack. The story's told from inside the Nazi high ranks and that makes it all the more interesting. <br/><br/>The acting is superb. The supporting players all bring there A game and script is tightly woven enough that the balance between each character is real. Regardless of what gets said in the media, I've always enjoyed Tom Cruise as an actor. His does admirably here and the role of Stauffenberg does not suffer from the surrounding talent. What I really enjoyed most is the simplicity with which the film unfolds from Singer's lens. He's probably the most talented young director in Hollywood and his attention to detail does not overwhelm. It adds the to the zazz of the picture and his abilities shooting the Hitler sequences make them absolutely nerve racking. Probably the most underrated film of 2008. It's worth adding to your collection."

","Tom Cruise's latest endeavor is a masterpiece of cinematic effort. Valkyrie tells the story of the last known attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>Cruise heads a distinguished cast that includes Kenneth Branaugh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Bill Nighy and Christian Berkel. Also starring in a minor role is East German refugee turned actor Thomas Kretschmann.<br/><br/>The tale unfolds with Col. Claus von Stauffenberg serving with Rommels forces in North Africa. It is immediately clear that he is disgusted with the war, Hitler and the course of events. After being seriously wounded he is transfered to the army high command in Berlin, where he falls into the company of several very senior officers who share his views. They want to avert the total devastation of Europe and Germany and make peace with the Allies.<br/><br/>While on leave at his home in Bamberg, Stauffenberg formulates the notion that he can use operation Walkuere (Valkyrie) to bring down Hitler's government. Valkyrie was originally Hitler's plan to save his government in the event of mass civil unrest or his death. Stauffenberg realizes that with some revisions it can be used to install a new government. The only catch is that Hitler must be killed for the plan to succeed.<br/><br/>With some careful maneuvering Stauffenberg is reassigned to a senior position in the reserve army that gives him access directly to Hitler. He revises Valkyrie and Hitler approves it without even reading it as he is so impressed with Stauffenberg's knowledge of Wagner's operas.<br/><br/>The plan as conceived by the conspirators is to kill Hitler and then claim the SS is attempting a coup. The reserve army will be activated and arrest senior SS and Nazi officials. The Ministries of War, Interior and Propaganda will be seized as well as SS Headquarters, effectively imploding the government. Members of the conspiracy would then be appointed to senior government and military positions. <br/><br/>A bomb is obtained and Stauffenberg travels to the sweltering forests of East Prussia where Hitler has his headquarters. An initial attempt is canceled when SS Reichfuehrer Heinrich Himmler does not appear at the briefing. A second briefing is scheduled but one of those small but significant twists of fate intervenes. Instead of being held in Hitlers concrete, windowless bunker, where the explosion is sure to kill everyone, it is moved to a wood conference room with plenty of windows, which nullify the effect of the bomb. The bomb is placed next to Hitler and Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin after witnessing the explosion.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in Berlin, General Olbricht (Nighy) was supposed to have activated the reserve army, but is having an attack of nerves. Stauffenberg manages to get things moving, but soon the plot begins to collapse due to Hitler having survived the blast. The plotters are soon rounded up and executed in the most brutal of fashions to include being hung from meat hooks with piano wire. Generals Beck (Stamp) and von Tresckow (Branaugh) commit suicide.<br/><br/>The conclusion is a documentary type review of everyones fate. It is amazing the vast array of people involved, yet the Gestapo never stumbled onto the plot.<br/><br/>Character development was superb. The performers play their parts flawlessly. We are concerned for their well being and can sympathize with their fear and dedication to their cause. One can imagine the inner terror they feel. Clearly exemplified is the fact that there were decent, honorable and courageous men in the German army who chose self sacrifice for their country's well being.<br/><br/>The performances, detailed sets, costumes and script were all first rate. Bryan Singer's iron fisted directing was incomparable as the story sped along with edge of your seat, nail biting intensity.<br/><br/>Special kudos to executive producer John Ottman who also wrote the very effective soundtrack and did the films editing. <br/><br/>The only flaw I detected was during the credits where Josef Goebbels' name is spelled ""Joseph"" Goebbels. I would highly recommend this film without reservation."

","A cheap historical reconstruction, trying to fill-up with insignificant details the serious flaws, and vulgarizing an important plot of the last century. Commercial, shallow and spectacular. One of the biggest failures is the over-blowing of von Stauffenberg, a mediocre officer with authority problems who, by a hazard game, came into the limelight for his moment of bungled glory. Here, we see him monstrously bigger than life, in the superficial performance of Cruise - otherwise, a very good actor, when he's used by a director capable to skillfully speculate his humor.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is interesting enough - mainly regarding the way it depicts the gregarious mass-psychology of the rats when the ship is sinking. The most important scenes are those regarding the labyrinthine interstices of the multiple conspiracies starting to overlap and collide, around the hypothesis of the Führer's demise. Extremely revealing for anyone concerned with the history's backstage. As a Romanian, I forcefully remembered the similar case of December 22, 1989, when many wings of the Securitate, K.G.B., C.I.A. and Free-Masonry were competing to take over the power, after Ceausescu had fled - everything leading to the ""terrorist setup"" staged by the Iliescu clique.

","Just saw this movie and felt that it took way too long to gather impetus and real drama. That's the difficulty in filming something--a coup--that until the moment of realization is just plotting on paper and a lot of talk. If the first half had been cut back significantly you could have had a really tight thriller instead of a turgid first half and a slowly gathering thriller of a second half. I blame the director and the editor for this. In this case, a 90 minute movie would have been great! But once Cruise was finally on his way to kill Hitler the film really kicks into gear, and then it's a pleasure all the way. And the director, actors and screenwriter are to be given great credit for making a pro-German WW2 film about an event all too few know about today. I myself had no idea of the resistance of many of the German officers toward Hitler, nor did I know about all the many attempts on his life.

","I find it difficult to review this movie. It appears neither faction nor drama.<br/><br/>The creators obviously debated whether to use natural English or ""'Allo 'Allo"" German accents, and on balance I think they made the wrong decision. For an English speaking audience, English spoken with a German accent is far more believable than a ragbag of differing English / American speech.<br/><br/>Casting is one of the most important aspects of any film, and here again I don't think it has been well done. Cruise, of course, is Cruise. Nighty is Nighty. And so on. ""Downfall"" was such a brilliant success because of the utterly believable casting (as well as the brilliance of the Fuhrer's portrayal). But in Valkyrie, none of the characters is developed: they are actors . The tensions that arose because of the doubt that the plot might succeed are shown - but not developed sufficiently to make you care.<br/><br/>The flashbacks and flashforwards don't do anything for the structure of the film, and if anything make it a little confusing.<br/><br/>The dialogue wasn't helped by rather poor sound mixing: I found some of it quite difficult to follow - but then the picture quality wasn't very good either so it may have been a digital projection problem.<br/><br/>I usually rate a movie personally as to whether I will buy the DVD so that I can watch it every year or two.

","That film is essential to plainly understand that history is never dead because it is always a movement coming from the contradictions of the world and the world will never be empty of contradictions. The film disturbs some good fragile European minds because it says that the Germans knew about the concentration camps and the Shoah because they just could not ignore it. It was public history. The Night of Crystal did not go unseen, and the concentration camp of Ravensbrûck was just across from the eponymous village on the other side of the small eponymous lake. And could the inhabitants of Weimar be that blind and not see the convoys going up to the camp of Buchenwald and running at the foot of the statue of Goethe and Schiller? Yes we have to reexamine some truths that are no longer valid enough. It disturbs many European minds to say that there were opponents in Germany and that they were not all dead, as long as they did not become dangerous, and that these opponents served Hitler because Hitler had managed to drape himself in the toga of Germany. It is disturbing to say that history dictates its own way and that no one can stop it and that it will never stop and that it will never end. Some can hijack it or slow it down. But any event is produced by the contradictions of the time and not by the will of anyone, not even the masses if these masses do not push in the direction where history wants to go, where the inner contradictions of the society itself dictate that it should go. It is pure vanity to pretend that you, singular, plural or collective, make history. When for a reason of any type history can be forced in a direction which is not its own, sooner or later that hijacking will create new contradictions that will bring the forces of freedom back on the table and history will go on along its own way, and yet that hijacking will have been the product of the very society in which it occurred. If Hitler lasted so long it is because he was produced by a certain situation and managed to get an authority that became hypnotic to the people, but he forced history and he created a violent contradiction that led to his own end. If Stalin lasted so long it was for exactly the same two reasons, even if his hijacking was not in the same direction as Hitler's and if the end came from the absolute exhaustion of all economic dynamism in the Soviet society. But Mao did the very same mistakes and his regime was saved when the economic dynamism was released in China itself, and Fidel Castro after him and after him Cuba will have to choose the same solution as the Chinese, the Vietnamese and many other countries have chosen, including in Europe of course. At times history comes back with extreme violence, at times with some velvet revolution, but it always comes back against those who try to force it, even if they are called Cromwell or Napoleon. And that disturbs our good old European friends because they want to solve historical problems by passing an act, publishing a statute or an edict or a law. Pure European vanity. It is thus a good thing that some exterior minds come into the picture and start telling these Europeans that they should try to think better and stop legally censoring life and history, and both life and history don't give the slightest damn about it anyway. The flaw of this film is that it is superficial and it does not really give the deep contradictory motivations of both the rebels and the Nazis, as Guenther Grass did recently by peeling the onion of his memory. But that dryness is probably the Scientologist touch of Tom Cruise because Scientology as well as Dianetics are trying to make life too clear to be deeply loaded with emotions and contradictions.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"

","I expected to be a little disappointed by this film but, to the contrary, I was greatly impressed by its dramatic impact and its deft handling of some pretty complex material. Balancing entertainment and enlightenment is always tricky and this film succeeds in both essentials. It is an honourable addition to the filmography of Resistance to Nazism which now includes Georg Elser, Sophie Scholl, Defiance, Rosentrasse, Amen, Edelweiss Pirates, Escape from Sobibor, and Swing Kids. These very different films tell important stories.<br/><br/>I have been a Stauffenberg fan since my teens and have taught the July Bomb Plot to adolescents for nearly 40 years. So I followed the ups and downs of the Cruise enterprise with some interest. Ownership of the story belongs neither to the Stauffenberg family, nor to the German people but to us all. It is clear that an American film star's attempt to make a feature film out of this Plot-which-could-have-changed-History has ruffled a lot of feathers.<br/><br/>Some Germans appear indignant that it has been left to a bunch of foreigners to make the first blockbuster about Stauffenberg. The Stauffenberg family worry that Cruise does not portray their Claus as they remember him. I may grumble that the actors who played Keitel and Witzleben were too short or that the film's depiction of Fromm demanding a Hitler salute from the stump of Stauffenberg's right arm was a piece of cheap theatricality. It would have been nice if they could have got Bruno Ganz to play the same Hitler as he did in 'Downfall'. Goring was poorly portrayed in both films.<br/><br/>However, all this misses the real point. Does the Cruise film sacrifice historical authenticity to the demands of box-office entertainment? I would say not. If anything, it errs in the other direction. Action scenes are kept to a minimum. There are several long, slow scenes. The story of ex-politicians and retired generals conspiring to overthrow the Nazi state is by its nature a very complex one to show on screen. However, it had to be tackled for the film to make sense. Beck, Goerdeler, Witzleben et al are shown but their characters and roles are not fully explained. This is to be regretted but I think that endeavouring to portray all the key plotters would have spoiled the film's pace and dynamic.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in all the key essentials. The technical details of the bombs used to try and kill Hitler and the reasons their failure are fully explained; the prevarications of Olbricht and Fromm, the role of Fellgiebel in closing down communications, the moral dilemma posed by treason in wartime, and, above all, the sheer magnitude of mounting a coup against a totalitarian state are all fully explored. The film shows the organisational successes of the plotters and stresses Hitler's survival as the main reason for the coup's failure. Otto Remer's talk with Goebbels and Hitler brings the coup to an end and the type of death meted out to the protagonists is accurately, if not comprehensively, depicted.<br/><br/>Of course, one could make this film in many different ways. A shot of Hitler staggering out of wreckage with his clothes in tatters or one of him showing Mussolini how Providence had delivered him from certain death would both make good cinema. However, the decision not to show Hitler escaping was the correct one as it would have undermined the dramatic narrative of the plotters putting their plans into motion.<br/><br/>Hitler does not dominate this film but there is a nice reference to his strict non-smoking vegetarianism. Someday History will have to make up its mind whether or not these were real virtues or merely the banal excesses of an obsessive, mean-spirited, petty bourgeois autodidact.<br/><br/>The decision to place Stauffenberg at the centre of the drama was correct even though this over-emphasises his role in the wider Plot. Cruise shows cultural sensitivity in his portrayal of a German hero. Stauffenberg's moral detestation of Nazism is well-documented and Cruise provides a sympathetic and convincing portrait of the man.<br/><br/>Critics have cast Stauffenberg as a convinced Anti-Semite, aghast at the murder of Jews but not at their exclusion from German society. As an upper-class Catholic, he would not have been immune to the religious Anti-Semitism propagated by his Church for 2000 years. Nazi Anti-Semitism was different and not to his taste. Most heroes have flaws. Horatio Nelson's strong support for Black Slavery and the Slave Trade has almost been written out of History. Both these gentlemen lived in cultures deeply ingrained with racist attitudes.<br/><br/>Likewise, the nationalist-conservative mind-set of the conspirators has long been criticised. Their desire for Germany to return to its 1914 borders with all that implied for the Poles is clearly documented.<br/><br/>Clearly, these plotters may have been fallen angels but they were the only angels to hand. Their force was the only one available to overthrow the Third Reich.<br/><br/>The decision to use written German throughout the film was a brave one, as was the avoidance of stereotypical German accents by British actors. Cruise makes little effort to disguise his American accent but this does not detract from his performance. These language decisions clearly help to make the audience more sympathetic to the main protagonists.<br/><br/>Well done, Tom Cruise! You have made an important event accessible to a wider audience. The failure of this plot would cost many lives as the war dragged on needlessly to its inevitable and sordid conclusion. This fact was not lost on my mother-in-law who watched the film with me. Her youngest brother Freddy was a British tank man killed in April 1945 at the age of 19. Success for Stauffenberg offered life to millions."

","My wife and I went on a movie spree this Christmas and of the five we saw, Valkyrie was by far the best. The story is well known as the last of 15 failed attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the final days of World War II. Tom Cruise's serious portrayal of German Panzer officer Stauffenberg was accurate, detailed, and well done.<br/><br/>The movie plays much like the best movies of the 1960s and ranks up there with The Longest Day, A Bridge Too Far, and Great Escape. The accuracy of the narrative, the uniforms, military equipment, and portrayal of the key players adds to the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that the average movie-going public will not appreciate this movie for the quality of entertainment it brings to the theaters, as is evinced by the popularity of such low brow tween movies like Twilight and Spirit.

","The review by Michael Malak in which he tells us how much this movie helps his 9 year old recognize ""Good Guys and Bad Guys"" is as unhelpful to us as seeing the movie is for his son. The Germanic peoples were not accidentally ""roped in"" to doing something against their will during World War II. And von Stauffenberg, though admittedly brave--as were all the plotters--was not a hero. (People who undertake extremely dangerous and risky schemes have to have courage, but that is different from heroism.)You have to remember that Germany started the war on September 1, 1939. The plot in this film came about after almost five years of atrocities and aggression. The whole idea popped into Stauffenberg's head not for ""humanitarian"" concerns or ""moral"" consciousness, but because the war was going very badly for the Germans. If Germany had been winning the war hands down, he never would have contemplated this. I worry that the Germans today, what with their monument to him and other plotters and such, are not inventing ""heroes"" so as to avoid the real lessons of history. The movie is also mediocre at best. 2 - 2½ stars."

","Valkyrie is a greatly disappointing film. It could have been a well made history lesson - unfortunately it ended up being a dull action movie. Why? First of all, it is yet another production glorifying German war criminals. Stauffenberg's intention was to remove Hitler not because of the atrocities he committed--but because he was losing the war. The film depicts Stauffenberg as a kind of an anti-Nazi hero. He was no hero - he considered Poles, Jews and other European nations to be subhumans. His treason was not a treason against Nazi ideals - it was an attempt to save them. This aspect of the real story is totally omitted in the movie. Besides being historically inaccurate the film is simply boring. Only those who lack historical knowledge cannot predict the obvious ending. Also, Tom Cruise and other actors are not convincing as anti-Nazi assassins. To sum up, Valkyrie is a typical Hollywood action movie that falsifies history."

","It beats all that to some people ""Good Germans"" in WWII are in fact traitors to their country. There is an old saying that ""someone convinced against his will is of the same opinion still."" I have heard that modern-day Germans are forced to say that Stauffenberg and his fellow traitors were ""heroes,"" (if they do not, they will have to find another job, if they can find one--some ""free country"") though they swore a personal oath to Hitler (not Germany) and they tried a clumsy plot to assassinate him (they knew what they were doing). And it was not necessary to do it this way, for until July, 1944, every officer who came into contact with Hitler wore the weapon appropriate to the uniform he was wearing and could have easily assassinated him (for some reason, Hitler trusted a man who swore an oath of loyalty). Of course he would have been killed instantly, rather than hatching a clumsy bomb plot and running away like the cowards they were. If you like revisionist history, you will like this film. If the overuse of the word ""hero"" makes you sick to your stomach, stay away."

","Valkyrie is a racy film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, although of course we all know how this story turns out. Unfortunately, it is told in such a way as to advance the post-modern agenda, continuing--albeit passively--the massive destruction of the Nazis into the post-Nazi era. Occidental civilisation is still committing suicide, and cultural barons such as these filmmakers are the reasons why. In no particular order:<br/><br/>1. It is true that the Nazis' systematic internment and gassing of millions of Jews was a horrid crime. So was the similar treatment they gave to an unknown number--probably millions--of non-Jews. So was their brutal bulldozing of Ukraine and European Russia. Klaus von Stauffenberg's memorial makes it sound as though the gassing of Jews was Hitler's only crime. It was not.<br/><br/>Now before you cast me as a closet anti-Semite, my objection is not to the depiction of the Jews as victims but to the shameless post-modern exploitation of racism, sexism, ""ageism"" and ""homophobia"" for profit, or worse--a grievous sin against both productivity and fairness. Look up ""Southern Poverty Law Center"" and ""ACORN."" Incidentally, one of my closest friends--an agnostic Jewess--is in agreement with me about the disgusting and exploitive ""Holocaust Industry.""<br/><br/>2. Klaus von Stauffenberg was first and foremost a pious man and a pedigreed aristocrat who believed above all in the supreme authority of God and in the legitimacy of terrestrial rulers. His beliefs were deeply seated from a transmission of many generations of faith and legitimate power. He was aware that tyrannicide is a delicate matter in Catholic theology and only justifiable under the gravest circumstances.<br/><br/>You would never know that from watching this film. Stauffenberg's Catholic religion is glossed over in the beginning and then never mentioned again, as though God had abandoned these great Christians in their noble struggle. (My own theory, based on my limited knowledge of Maistre, is that their failure was allowed as a punishment on Europe for turning its back on God. But God never abandoned these great men: they are, today, in a place where they no longer suffer the treachery of us, their colourless subjects.) Nor is Stauffenberg shown to consult, as he did, with Cardinal Count Preysing of Berlin, who advised Stauffenberg of the morality of this move and even risked his own life to help the plot.<br/><br/>3. Tom Cruise cannot act in any role except Ethan Hunt. Casting him as the great aristocrat Klaus von Stauffenberg is an insult to this latter man's memory.<br/><br/>Shame, shame, shame, shame. Any chance you get to overheat the film lamp or throw a DVD in the microwave, take it. Wipe this shameful underreporting off the map of history."

","The air is literally full of tension and thrills, also at the beginning when the first killing attempts are made. Tom Cruise is helped in his aim by a lineup of British supporting players, Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Izzard and Tom Wilkinson. The story follows an evident tradition of Hitchcockian situations, the excitement coming out from exchanges of dialogue more than from big action scenes (a few explosions in this instance). Stauffenberg's role is depicted as emotionally rousing, and that's probably the sticking point of the film; other than that, in spite of an interesting and original perspective of World War II, the film doesn't break the ranks of a good thriller."

","Well, its finally here. For ages now much of the press has rubbed their hands with glee as they looked forward to trashing this pet-project from the Cruiser. Cruise V Hitler after all had TURKEY written all over it. Even I had a laugh as I waited to see the wee man's attempt at appealing to the greater German public after they slammed Scientology and branded it a cult. That of course is another debate all together. On to the film. Its not nearly as bad as many people had hoped or expected, some of it is rather good in fact. From what I can tell it is historically accurate in its depiction of the failed Von Stauffenberg plot to assassinate the Fuhrer in July 1944. The recreation of Hitler's Wolf's Lair and the Berghof is picture-perfect and adds much realism to the film and the direction from X-Men's Bryan Singer keeps things nicely bubbling along. The film's biggest problem though is Tom Cruise as the aristocratic Claus Von Stauffenberg. He simply fails to pull it off and comes across as a cheesed off - dare I say it, ""Little Hitler."" The role needed to reflect the Bavarian Count should've gone to someone like Liam Neeson or perhaps Christian Bale. Strange and uncomfortable casting permeates this film: the presence of Eddie Izzard as a communications officer at the Wolf's Lair is totally out of place and much of the cast also fails to convince. The best performances come from the European actors ,Thomas Kretschmann, Christian Berkel and the gorgeous Carice Van Houten who was last seen dodging more Nazis in Black Book. Sadly not enough is seen from them as the British with Cruise in-tow take centre stage. If this film had been made by the people behind Downfall it could have been so much better and as is, it remains something of a missed opportunity (no pun intended)."

","Technical errors in this otherwise good movie. Opening scene with the civilian model of the Junkers JU-52 'Iron Annie' number D-2600 piloted by Hans Baur whom I knew personally. This was the same plane that Hitler used in the 1932 election campaign and was in the movie 'Triumph of the Will'. By 1943 he was using the much larger Focke-Wulf 200 Condor as his personal plane. Scene in Berlin at the government quarters with all the flags flying as if they were on parade and no bomb damage to the buildings. One would think that the Allied bombers could not find their target - they did and over 420 times. Most notable error was when Major Remer was told to obey Dr. Goebbels instructions only - no mention that he was promoted to Colonel on the spot skipping one rank. The security guards at the Rastenberg HQ were portrayed as army and not the SS escort unit who always protected him. Scene in Berghof after the Normandy invasion showing Hermann Goring stating that he had things 'under control"". By this time in the war Goring was held in such disfavor that he was not invited to staff meetings. His deputy, the half-Jewish Field Marshall Erhard Milch was running the air show.

","""Valkyrie"" sure isn't the greatest film you will ever see, yet it's not the worst as it has plenty of drama and suspense and the plot is filled with intrigue and intense feelings to make any film fan and history buff interested.

Claus Von Stauffenberg who during his command time of WWII decides to plot an assassination attempt of the ruthless and evil German ruler Hitler. As you watch the film if your looking for lots of action you will be disappointed, as it's focus and most scenes deal with behind the scenes workings and overthrowing of a secret plan to disguise a government with the end plans leading them to Hitler. Yet any history buff of those times of WWII and those who know German times along with Hitler history will understand the film well. That said I don't want to give away to much info.

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>I will ruin nothing by saying he does speak English in the film. As a matter of fact, everyone does. Cruise is the only one with an American accent, though, which may have criticized. I am not sure why, though. I guess if you speak with a British accent, you get a pass (Sean Connery in ""The Hunt for Red October"" anyone?) Maybe these folks would have rather had all of them suffer through fake German accents or even a subtitled film.<br/><br/>That said, I felt the suspense build, even though I knew enough of the history to know what would happen. All of the performances were good, with Bill Nighy's being exceptional. Was it the greatest film ever? No. But few are. I would recommend this film to anyone who would like to know of a little known event in the chapter of World War II."

Such an interesting story would be reflected to cinematography according to me. I think, the director and the writer didn't show an amazing effort and they had a simple way to create a film.

","Most of the population knows that Hitler lead Germany into a spiraling government of lies, torment, pain, and his propaganda filed campaigns shunned anything in the last 200 years. I've always been fascinated with WWII, Hitler, and how he worked, but I did not once come across ""Project Valkyrie"" in the research I had done. I was surprised to find that this movie was more about the German people's attempt to free themselves and save ""Sacred Germany,"" than just a mere assassination film.<br/><br/>Upon hearing some critics saying this is ""one of the worst films of 2008"" and ""Tom Cruise's acting is distracting"", I was hesitant to see it, however, the movie delivers on far more levels than it faults on. Sure Tom Cruise is a bit distracting, but only in *maybe* two scenes, but even with those, it is for the movie's drama.<br/><br/>At the point in which the movie brings us to the actual attempt, my heart was POUNDING waiting for the explosion. The suspense is crazy with this film; it seems to be at just the right times and is presented perfectly. The ending, itself, is quite suspenseful, even though you know the outcome. The last sentence Tom Cruise's character says will haunt you for weeks to come, I can guarantee it.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie definitely deserves some awards. The directing if phenomenal, the acting is spot on, and the tone couldn't be better.

","I really wanted to see this movie. All my life I have been fascinated by the daring of the anti-Nazi conspirators -- especially the aristocratic, chivalrous Von Stauffenberg, who in today's Germany (especially in the German military) is given the worshipful adoration and veneration of Martin Luther King, Davy Crockett, and John F. Kennedy combined.<br/><br/>Cruise never gets the chance to show us what made this shining knight shine, what made this time-bomb for goodness really tick. We don't get to see him cut loose as a soldier, machine gunning Tommies and slugging it out in the desert sands. We don't get to see him blinded by a flash of insight as a Jewish child is kicked into the gutter or an elderly rabbi is forced to scrub the pavement with his face. We don't even get to see him do a passable bedroom scene with his foxy wife.<br/><br/>Instead we get an hour of stupendously dull plotting, where Cruise is forced to run with droopy, flaccid character actors like Bill Nighy, Kenneth Branagh, and assorted other Englishmen who look pathetically out of place in any uniform, in any army, at any time. The movie really telegraphs the fact that all these conspirators lack the ruthlessness and determination to fight fire with fire and shoot to kill the Nazi menace. Only Tom Wilkinson, as the shifty General Fromm, and Eddie Izzard as the well-meaning communications officer, give us some sense of the real moral complexity of the plotters, not to mention the terrifying agony of these brave men who risked torture and death.<br/><br/>Finally, long after it's too late, in the last half hour we get a taste of suspenseful drama, as Von Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin and tries to bluff the uprising to victory even as Hitler prepares his gruesome revenge. It's painfully revealing that Cruise, working the phone banks like a celebrity at a telethon, is far more believable than he is playing the cold-eyed assassin. ""What's that you say, general? Yes, that's right, we're in charge now. Don't forget, you heard it here first! Yes, that's right, I'm in charge, because I just said so! Can we count on you for your support? Gee whiz, why not?"" He's believable, but more like a frat boy running a bake sale than a gallant officer risking his life. Charming, but not quite appropriate to the situation.<br/><br/>One final note: watch for Christan Berkel and Thomas Kirtschmann, two genuine German actors who were both superb in the death of Hitler classic UNTERGANG. If the whole UNTERGANG cast had been here, along with the director and the scriptwriter, this movie might have been a classic too. Instead it's just a so-so vehicle for Tom Cruise."

Bill Nighy is career-best, doing away with the hammy mannerisms usually blighting his roles, and there are nice parts for Kenneth Branagh, Terence Stamp and even Eddie Izzard to get their teeth into. Yes, Carice van Houten is wasted but then you can't have everything.<br/><br/>One thing I was unsure about was this film's portrayal of Hitler, which was going to be tough after Bruno Gans did such a good job in DOWNFALL. When I realised ROME's David Bamber (an actor usually known for his comedic roles) was tackling the role, I wasn't sure what to think, but he acquits himself well with the part and is unrecognisable for the most part.<br/><br/>The film gradually builds suspense and tension despite the inevitability of the climax and never resorts to flashy special effects or action scenes to keep the viewers watching.

"juliankennedy23","6","2","4","20 June 2009"," Valkyrie... Valkyrie... Valkyrie Profile (SPOILER ALERT)
","Valkyrie: 6 out of 10: Roger Ebert pointed out a fundamental problem with Valkerie in his 1975 review of The Hindenburg. “How can you thrill people with the saga of a dirigible floating across the Atlantic Ocean? We know it is going to blow up over Lakehurst, N.J.; but we also know, alas, that it's not going to blow up before then.” The story of Valkyrie makes for a kick ass documentary. It is a fascinating tale; a great map of what ifs and almost happened(s). It is not however major motion picture material. In fact, I recently read a review of that Jews in the forest movie, Defiance, that Valkerie shared the theater with last December. The Defiance article perceptively pointed out that the story of people not being found by Nazis does not, by itself, naturally lend itself to a good film treatment. Needless to say, the story of people (SPOILER ALERT) not blowing up Hitler also runs into this same problem.<br/><br/>Now, not all films that have a forgone historical conclusion need to fall into this trap. Titanic, for example, hits the iceberg fairly quickly and a successfully shoehorned a love triangle to give the audience a reason to pay attention. (Lightning did not strike twice as Pearl Harbor tried the exact same trick to much derision.) Titanic is but one example, Apollo 13 made us care about the characters to the point that we forgot that everything would work out. More importantly, Apollo 13 was about more than just a retread of what happened. Too often Valkerie comes across as a strange documentary where all the Nazi’s are British. While the story is fascinating on its own right, we do not go to the movies just to be shown what happened. We want to feel for the characters as well.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise took a lot of flak for making Valkerie. It overall was undeserved. Though his performance failed to reach the audience emotionally, one could hardly place the entire fault at Cruise’s doorstep. The script really did not give him much to do. Valkyrie is a strange this happened then that happened story with little emotional reflection. In fact, both Kenneth Branagh and Bill Nighly seem more out of place in the film than Cruise. (In addition, why exactly again, outside of Cruise, are all the Nazis British? Wouldn’t that be like a Japanese cast playing Chinese peasants in a Rape of Nanking drama.) Speaking of British Nazis, Britain’s 2007 Equality legislation may have been in the filmmaker’s mind as they shoehorned poor Carice van Houten in as Cruise’s wife and basically the only woman in the cast. She sticks out. For one thing, she does not even look British and speaks with a weird continental accent. Oh and the script drops her as a character just when it would be useful to give us a reason to care about the (SPOILER ALERT) Germans failure to kill Hitler.<br/><br/>Speaking of (SPOILER ALERT) not killing Hitler; one thing the movie neglects to mention is where were tall these Good German officers when Germany was winning the war. After all, it was only after the successful Normandy invasion and the collapse of the eastern front that Hitler all of a sudden needed to be killed. Where were these folks when the German army was marching through Paris and at the gates of Moscow? Yeah that is what I thought. It is somewhat hard to make a movie when the “good guys” come across as opportunistic scum.<br/><br/>Overall Valkerie is a well-made movie with a predictable and emotionless story. It is hard to root for traitors (no matter how noble) and the movie gives one little emotional reason to do so outside of the obvious fact that they are trying to (SPOILER ALERT) kill Hitler."

","This is an excellent war movie about the plot to kill Adolf Hitler. I watched it expecting a lot and it definitely achieved over what I expected. It was surprisingly historically accurate.<br/><br/>The action and plot was great and so was the acting. I think Tom Cruise did an excellent job portraying Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Although the ending was sad - the movie was still very enjoyable. The suspense of the movie was excellent.<br/><br/>This is certainly one of the best war movies ever made. This is so far the best movie of 2009 and is a must see. I enjoyed every moment of watching it.<br/><br/>This is a film that is great on the big screen. I totally recommend anyone who loves action and war films to watch this."

","I have to admit I came to the movie with a Tom Cruise bias. A friend of mine who is also a movie nut - and I agreed that in almost every Cruise movie he has to run away from an explosion of some kind.<br/><br/>That being said, I had to brave a traffic jam in Sacramento (on a Saturday even) and missed the North Africa sequence, about the first 8-10 minutes of the movie I heard.<br/><br/>All that being said from what I do know of my WW2 history this was technically accurate. Of course unlike the usual thrillers one knows the outcome beforehand, but it was nevertheless an attention-riveting movie.<br/><br/>I finished a good book on Rommel, and he is not mentioned anywhere in the movie. I do know that he was implicated in the plot, and I believe he was to be installed in the ""new"" govt to negotiate with the allies. Rommel was one of the few Nazi generals respected by the allies, not only for his tactical brilliance in North Africa and France (I view him as a German Robert E. Lee), but his humane treatment of allied prisoners - against Hitler's orders - in North Africa. He was forced to commit suicide because of his involvement in the plot, although he took no part in the planning; only a passive involvement.<br/><br/>Also while there were many brave Germans involved in this plot - I read somewhere that 5,000 were killed by the Nazis in the aftermath - one does not get a feel for the widespread and terrible repercussions in the movie. I was pleasantly surprised that his wife Nina and her children survived and Nina died only in 2006.<br/><br/>A historian said of this plot that it was ""too little and too late"". It would be easy (and futile) to speculate what would have happened had it succeeded - Roosevelt and Churchill agreed on a principle of ""unconditional surrender"" - in part to keep Stalin from making his separate peace - although Churchill (and many German officers admitted later) that with nothing to lose, it meant that Germans would continue the futility of fighting with many needless deaths after D-Day.<br/><br/>That being said, I still enjoyed the movie. Didn't want to wait the 45 minutes for the restart to see the North Africa sequence so I will probably get it on the DVD."

","It was heartening to know that this was based on a True Story. Good to know even under Hitler's rule, people had the courage to stand up for what was right. So thanks to Tom Cruise and Bryan Singer for letting the world know about such people and their efforts.<br/><br/>The movie was well made and had some great acting. As mentioned by the other IMDb reviewers, the supporting cast had done their job to perfection.<br/><br/>But on the flip side, there were just too many characters in the movie and all with some significance. So you had to stay alert at all times in the movie and not miss a single sequence. The other drawback I had was that the very essence of the movie (suspense) was lost even before it began. Since everyone knows its a failed assassination plot, what was I waiting for in the Climax? So while I empathized with them I couldn't root for the protagonists.<br/><br/>But all in all, it was a good drama and should find something in the Academy awards this year! 8/10"

","Going in to this movie i thought it wouldn't have been as great as it was. Tom Cruise did an amazing job on his role, as rest of the other cast, and it actually was more of what happened in history, instead of just trying to put a lot of Special FX into the movie to catch the attention of the audience. Also i had to admit, it did not have as many action scenes as i thought. But even though it did not have these parts it still was an amazing movie. This also had many deep scenes that made you think and actually brought some emotions up.

","After hearing the negative reviews, I was a bit anxious about seeing Valkyrie. However, it turned out to be a pleasant and enjoyable movie with a great supporting cast, a solid script, top-notch direction and stunningly realistic visuals. Of course, the first thing everyone talks about is Tom Cruise. I actually thought he was very solid, and after the first five minutes or so, I really pretty much forgot that it was Tom Cruise and saw only saw Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. It sounds impossible since he's so recognizable, but it happened. Unfortunately, most critics have written off his performance as 'distractingly bad,' and in my opinion, they are exaggerating a good deal; there is no doubt a lot of bias toward Cruise, and I suspect that many were already bashing his performance before even seeing the movie. I feel like this is rather unfair since a lot of critics have given the film itself negative reviews merely because they disliked his performance. The supporting cast also does a very good job, with special mention to Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson. Kenneth Branagh did a solid job considering he had surprisingly little screen time. <br/><br/>Valkyrie is meant to be a thriller - and that is exactly what it is. The score, Bryan Singer's direction, visuals and decidedly bleak script contribute to the tension that carries throughout the movie. It is remarkable that Singer was able to keep up the fast paced suspense when we already know the ending. Speaking of the ending, this is a depressing movie and doesn't offer the glimmer of hope at the end that one might expect from a WWII movie. Valkyrie could easily have been turned into an Oscar-bait drama, but instead, it is clearly geared more toward the audience with the explosions, action and expansive vistas that are the stuff of adrenaline-pumping action movies. And there is no doubt that it looks fantastic. The visuals and costumes look absolutely authentic and might even garner the movie a couple Oscar nods.<br/><br/>I also think that even though Valkyrie is presented more as a thriller than a war movie, it's interesting to learn about the story, which is relatively unknown to the general public, yet a momentous part of history. The movie does a good job of showing how far this small group of Germans was willing to go in order to save the country - and the continent - from total devastation.<br/><br/>If you go into the theater looking for a decent, entertaining thriller with a great story, then Valkyrie won't disappoint."
"mihaly_bora","8","2","4","1 January 2009"," I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie.
","I went to see Valkyrie last night with quite a few reservations (mainly because Tom Cruise and Bryan Singer, whose works I didn't really like), but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The basic idea of the film intrigued me from the beginning: a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Since I'm a history buff, I didn't expect to like this film one bit, but it delivered.<br/><br/>The script is not terrific, but good, it delivered what it was supposed to deliver (which can be said about the whole film) with one exception: what exactly prompted Stauffenberg to turn on the Nazis? That wasn't explained at all.<br/><br/>Also, I think the deaths of the plotters weren't as cathartic as I expected (with the exceptions of Bill Nighy and Terrence Stamp). I was especially disappointed by Kenneth Branagh's death, they should have shown the explosion.<br/><br/>The main strength of the film is the terrific actors: Kenneth Branagh is excellent (unfortunately, for historical reasons, he didn't get as much screen time as I hoped), Tom Wilkinson is simply marvelous as General Fromm, a character you love to hate. And the greatest surprise: I could accept Tom Cruise as Stauffenberg (that's not a comment on his acting skills, my problem is that in most of his films, I saw *him*, not the characters he played).<br/><br/>Other notable players were Terrence Stamp whose last line gave me the shivers and the bloody brilliant Bill Nighy as General Olbricht, probably the most human character in this movie. David Bamber's Hitler was moody and good, he certainly has a screen presence, a silent menace that looms over the picture.<br/><br/>The only character I was unhappy about was Carl Goerdeler, but that wasn't the actor's fault. He was more heroic in real life than in this film. In Valkyrie, he was in many ways scripted and played as a weasel-like character.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a fairly good movie, not brilliant (The Downfall comes to mind), but good. I will surely purchase it on DVD."
"cathylr","10","0","0","4 July 2020"," A captivating story about a true story
","Because of the despicable polemic Tom Cruise raised showing off his ´private´ life, I hadn´t managed to watch a film he is starring in for the past 14 years (the last one was Mission Impossible 3). However, as he keeps on being successful, that many of his ´recent´ films are on Netflix and that I like stories and documentaries about history, I decided to give it a chance. I did not regret for a second.
From the very first image, Tom Cruise caught my attention, playing this bitter Nazy who wants to kill Hitler. There are many other fims in which he did not completely convince me but in this one, he is simply brillant. The rest of the cast, Bill Nighy being the next name that I have in mind, is also stunning and gripping.
If the first hour was really good in the reconstitution of the events, the second half is even more captivating. I have read a critic saying the he was on the edge of his seat, and so was I. It is one of the very few films that grabbed me in the stomac from the very first minute until the very end, not only because of the story to which no one can be unsensitive to, but also because of the dynamic that is not leaving a second of respite.
Bryan Singer is once again showing a great attention to details that the audience has to follow as the story goes on no to loose any element. I already had greatly appreciated his work on The Usual Suspects and The X-men. So this is to be added to my list.
A gripping film that I will surely watch again."

","One of my favorite World War II films VALKYRIE manages to be a suspense and emotional film, with spectacular performances (especially that of Tom Cruise), good cinematography and good soundtrack."
"rmarkd","8","0","0","16 June 2020"," Very nice historical thriller
","Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a colonel in the Nazi army who believes Hitler's plan of world conquer is not going to work and decides that the only way to Germany to survive is to enact the Valkyrie plan. Part of that plan is to assassinate Hitler. The movie follows how they put the Valkyrie plan into place along with the plan for Stauffenberg to kill Hitler.<br/><br/>First, some things to cast aside, in my opinion:
* Historical inaccuracies: I should say I'm by no means a history buff, but I have read that liberties were taken to add that thriller feel to the movie. I don't really see that so much as a problem. Yes, this is more thriller than documentary, but that's okay. I think the main points were kept true and what this movie will likely do is to get some people to research further. So any historical inaccuracy, to me at least, is no big deal. They never said this was 100% true and that shouldn't be expected from a Hollywood movie, where the main goal is to make money.
* The accents. Yes, they weren't German accents, but so what? A German accent in English is pointless, and keeping this in German would have turned some people away. I happen to enjoy subtitles in movies, but again, this is a Hollywood movie.
* Tom Cruise. I think this was done at the height of his scientology craze., which turned people away. His personal beliefs have no bearing in my opinion of the movie.<br/><br/>Taking all that away, you're left with a pretty thrilling movie that's based on a true and interesting story. The scenes looked visually accurate, especially for people like me, who aren't history buffs. The acting was solid from pretty much everyone involved, and there were some major actors here. Tom Cruise's performance seemed just fine to me. Yes, he came out as very American, but again, I'm not looking for accuracy. I thought the pacing was nice and didn't feel any lag in the movie. In all, just a solid movie that I quite enjoyed."
"stefannemanja7","10","0","0","14 June 2020"," Analysts - About...
","""Valkyrie"" is a meticulous thriller based on a large-scale conspiracy within the German army to assassinate Hitler, leading to a failed bombing attempt on July 20, 1944. At the center of the plot was Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, played here by Tom Cruise as the moving force behind the attempted coup, which led to 700 arrests and 200 executions, including von Stauffenberg's. Because we know Hitler survived, the suspense is centered in the minds of the participants, who call up the Reserve Army and actually arrest SS officials before discovering that their bomb did not kill its target.<br/><br/>Considering they were planning high treason with the risk of certain death, the conspirators seem remarkably willing to speak almost openly of their contempt for Hitler. That may be because they were mostly career officers in the army's traditional hierarchy and hated Hitler as much for what he was doing to the army as for what he was doing to the country. Realizing after the invasion of Normandy that the war was certainly lost, they hoped to spare hundreds of thousands of military and civilian lives.<br/><br/>Von Stauffenberg was known to be ""offended"" by the Nazi treatment of Jews in the 1930s and considered the Kristallnacht a disgrace to Germany, which possibly disturbed him as much as the fate of its victims. In any event, little is said among the conspirators about the genocide then underway -- although, being alienated from the SS, perhaps they didn't know what was happening. Perhaps.<br/><br/>They repeatedly tell each other that even should they fail, at least the world would know that not all Germans supported Hitler. And so it does. And whatever their deepest motives, they gave their lives in trying to kill the monster. The film, directed by Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects""), works heroically to introduce us to the major figures in the plot, to tell them apart, to explain their roles and to suggest their differences. The two best supporting performances are by Kenneth Branagh, as a major-general who smuggles a bomb into Hitler's inner circle and then must smuggle it out again, and Tom Wilkinson, as a general who artfully plays both sides of the fence, treating the plot with benign neutrality while covering himself should it fail.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is perfectly satisfactory, if not electrifying, in the leading role. I'm at a loss to explain the blizzard of negative advance buzz fired at him for the effrontery of playing a half-blind, one-armed Nazi hero. Two factors may be to blame: (a) Cruise has attracted so much publicity by some of his own behavior (using Oprah's couch as a trampoline) that anything he does sincerely seems fair game for mockery, and (b) movie publicity is now driven by gossip, scandal and the eagerness of fanboys and girls to attract attention by posing as critics of movies they've almost certainly not seen. Now that the movie is here, the buzz is irrelevant, but may do residual damage.<br/><br/>If I say that Cruise is not electrifying, I must add that with this character, in this story, he cannot and should not be. This is a film about veterans of officer rank, with all the reserve and probity that officers gather on the way up. They do not scream or hurry and do not care to be seen that way. They have learned not to panic under fire, and they have never been more under fire than now.<br/><br/>A key element of their plot is to use Hitler's ""Valkyrie"" plan against him. The reserves were held back to defend Berlin and Hitler in case of an Allied assault, so von Stauffenberg conceived the strategy of killing Hitler, ordering up the reserves to ensure stability and making its first order of business the immobilization of the SS. We see that the plan might well have worked. Indeed, it did -- until the news arrived that Hitler was still alive. So much did the Fuhrer command the fanatical loyalty of troops and civilians with an almost mystical grip, that merely his voice on the radio could defeat the plot, even with Germany clearly facing ruin.<br/><br/>The July 20 plot is an intriguing footnote to history, one of those ""what if"" scenarios. If it had succeeded, one of the hopes of the conspirators was said to be an alliance with the Allies against Russia. Given the political realities of the time, when Russia was seen as our ally, that would have been insane, but it shows the plotters continuing to dream of a reborn professional German army with roles for them. The question of the liberation of the death camps is a good one. Even the Allies did not bomb the rail lines leading to them. There were so very, very many people who did not know.<br/><br/>S."

","Main character of this movie, Colonel Claus van Stauffenberg makes a plan how to save Germany from Adolf Hitler. It is based on true events during World War II and tells a story of planning the assassination of Adolf Hitler. The operation is called Valkyrie and beside Colonel Stauffenberg it involved a group of senior German officers and politicians.<br/><br/>The movie starts with German language while Colonel Stauffenberg writes about Nazi's crimes, and then after few seconds it transitions into English language. While the dialogs during the movie continue to be in English, background voices, singing and even writings on documents are in German. It sets some authentic atmosphere, so it's not bothering that much why actors don't speak German throughout the movie. In addition, visually it looks really good. Attention to details on uniforms, Nazi headquarters and makeups are top-notch.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie you can feel and understand the pressure some of the characters go through. Their life depends on the success of this operation and I feel the movie did a good job in portraying this. However, you don't discover much about the characters involved in the plot. Colonel Stauffenberg as a main character gets some minor screen time about his family and his past military activities and that's it. I would like to see some back stories for some of the officers, especially Lieutenant Werner von Haeften who was Stauffenberg adjutant. This would explain some of his actions at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this movie especially if you're fan of World War II events."

","The trouble with this film is also the reason where it was made, in Hollywood, it is also the good reason we are talking about it ! Let me explain :-<br/><br/>This should have been made with more German actors (or at least more germanic speaking Europeans) speaking in German, but with English subtitles for the english speaking world, I watch a lot of foreign films and have always found that it is much much better to have them speaking their natural language with subtitles, you get the meaning better and it does not look crap like when dubbed.<br/><br/>That saying, we would probably not have seen this nor be talking about it if Hollywood did not get a hold of this story, so its great that it was made (by Americans) but it could have been much better.<br/><br/>Despite what I say it is a good film, well directed and well acted, I have always found Tom Cruise to be eminently watchable, the English actors did a good job, at least they were more Germanic, David Bamber (who played Hitler) didn't get it quite right though, the 2 actual Germans in the top cast were good (but not speaking German), the photography was very good, it could have benefited with being a bit more dramatic with the story line stretched out a bit more. I think the late Rutger Hauer (although Dutch and not looking like von Stauffenberg) would have been a better fit than Tom in the main role, maybe Tom could have played Hitler, after all he is the correct height, it would make a change for him to play a bad guy for once, I'm sure he would have done a good job.<br/><br/>So Glad it was made but wish it was in German with more Germanic Actors."

","I knew about this real story two decades before the film was made so I knew a lot going in and was dreading in the back of my mind what they would ""alter"" for the movie and or to suit Mr. Cruise's ego and team of image consultants that he has employed since the start of his career in the early 1980's. Yes ladies he's ""that"" old. But I must say it was done very historically correct and yes Mr. Cruise fit himself in the real life character of Stauffenberg rather than ""tweek"" and leave out stuff, character wise for him to still pull off the movie star image he loves to protect and cultivate. Did I see ""cult"" in that last word...hum?
Any-who, this is one of the best interpretations of that event of July 20th 1944 that tried to kill Adolf Hitler and end World War 2 in the European theatre of war then and there. Many other films have included this day of attempted assassination since the 1950's and many have handled it very well.

","Give Tom Cruise credit for his performance in Valkyrie.

This is the almost-impossible challenge the film's plot poses. If this ambitious hope can be grasped, Cruise's character, a still-young but old-souled combat hero, von Stauffenberg, might just be the man to grasp it.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson give career-polishing performances as German generals moving in and out of 'the plot' with varying degrees of self-interest. <br/><br/>The filmed scenes, which mostly stick to wartime Berlin barracks, look fact-perfect.

","Valkyrie's account of the failed plot to kill Hitler is no more than a thriller that does not thrill. In theory, it is possible to tell a suspense story about a historical event with a known outcome. Although we know de Gaulle was never assassinated, Day of the Jackal pulls its audience along with the intricate details of how the fictional killer almost brings it off, and how the French security services thwart him at the last minute. It works as a howdunnit. But the story of the plot to kill Hitler is a whydunnit, and Valkyrie takes the why for granted. <br/><br/>Because the Nazis give us the luxury of both hindsight and moral certainty, they make us lazy. We know they are absolutely evil, and we know they are going to lose the war. So it is easy to take for granted that Stauffenberg and the other conspirators are making the right choice. They know the regime is evil, they know the war is lost, and they want to make a statement and maybe salvage something from the wreck. It's just what we would think in their place – or so we flatter ourselves.<br/><br/>But that reaction is superficial because we are not in their place but in our place, looking back at theirs. What Valkyrie should have done is taken the audience mentally into a world where the Nazis are the established, legitimate government and all good patriots want Germany to win the war, or at least to escape defeat. That takes more than swastika flags over every post office. It takes the creation through dialog of a social atmosphere in which Nazism is conventional and right. Without that baseline, the conspirators' decision to overthrow their own government and embrace defeat is trivial. How have these few men come to think that Hitler is evil and crazy when everyone else still follows him? What led them to choose what everyone around them thinks is wrong? Valkyrie doesn't tell us. Tom Cruise looks like pictures of Stauffenberg, but he conveys nothing of the man's inner life. Without that, Valkyrie has less point than Swing Kids."

We weren't taught in detail about the assassination attempts on Hitler, so I was curious to see what made this particular attempt a box office movie.<br/><br/>Coming from a German background, it was a bit odd hearing the incorporated English accents in German history. But I tossed that aside and focused on the entire plot. With all honestly, I've seen Tom Cruise in better roles but he did put an ample amount of effort into Colonel Stauffenberg. I absolutely loved the ensemble cast. The entire story was gripping and I got extreme chills during the actual attempt scene.<br/><br/>Overall, I think Valkyrie was quite enjoyable. The authentic feel of Nazi Germany and the officials were well executed, no pun intended."

","Bryan Singer's Valkyrie (2008) reminded me of Anatole Litvak's The Night of the Generals (1967), and not for being - both - thrillers, taking place in Nazi Germany during WWII, and concerning German officers.<br/><br/>Valkyrie depicts the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. The plot failed, however Hitler ended up, not so long after, suicide (don't listen to Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds 2009!). So it's a movie where the good guys lose, which could allow a lukewarm feeling, especially while watching a Tom Cruise, Bryan Singer, Hollywood thriller. Unfortunately, that feeling fulfilled, yet due to extra other reasons.<br/><br/>The script focused only on the star; Tom Cruise as Colonel Von Stauffenberg. Because save him, you don't know a thing about the rest of the plotters; Just slight touches to separate one from another, more than characteristic features. You're even less informed in places, to ask about the identity, and the necessity, of that man who swims in a pool, mocking at ""It's a drill, or not?"", or that old, always infuriated, general who curses with insults like ""Montgomery's whore"", with no good answers. So when United Artists propagandized Valkyrie as ""A character-driven thriller"", you have to sense big deficiency.<br/><br/>Sometimes not speaking in a movie, with meaty image, produces something great. In this movie, it's enjoyable in counted moments. Like when the lead is shaving, however awfully tortured. Or when he plans the whole Valkyrie plot, while listening to Wagner's music, beaten under the bombing. But in more moments, frank oddity was the result. For instance, when the lead returns home, first-time handicapped, there is nearly no dialogue uttered, even from his children (who leave him to play??). Another moment when he arrives Hitler's meeting, secretly carrying a time bomb to assassinate Hitler, the latter eyes him in fearful manner, inexplicably; as if the movie wants to delude us that Hitler exposed everything, and our lead is in danger, yet in a forced way to naive extent. Generally, that technique concerned about visual tense at the expense of drama, which left good amount of emptiness, while having - in the same time - many different characters, motives, and events.<br/><br/>To add fuel to the flames, the dialogue was strictly informative more than expressive, witty, or fair to this blend of people. Many scenes, like the one of presenting the Valkyrie plan by the lead, felt extremely dry, exactly the way any uncreative documentary would make. Everybody speaks as directly as a robot. Any mildness is interdicted. And there wasn't enough heart. So when Terence Stamp's character commits suicide, easing up on himself: ""I remember better times"", it's like the script's attempt to capture a historical moment, however sternly, with no juice or much background. This is why you eventually don't feel satisfied by the movie's list of actors like Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and others. Because other than falling in the big shadow of Cruise's character, they were wronged by semi-mute script!<br/><br/>In the operation part, things run clearly mute, with a feel of flat documentary. It isn't about the nature of Valkyrie's plot as a failure, or missing art re-writing history (a la Tarantino's movie); it's about preferring suspense on human beings, and in a movie with no familiar ""suspenseful-movie-climax"". So while the script strove to build exciting moment after another; it forgot to dilute the viewer's negative emotional load, out of executing all the plotters at last, with adequate character study. Therefore, the movie became a thrilling documentary about bunch of failures, more than character-driven thriller about courageous heroes.<br/><br/>David Bamber as the Führer of Germany was perfectly pale, being a short unperceivable guy. Depriving Hitler from charisma and menace, in a movie where he's the main target and enemy, is a fatal mistake. And the movie's tricks to compensate this miscast, and misdirect, were pathetic as I showed early. John Ottman's music was too undertone to effect, enhancing the movie's cold character.<br/><br/>Pros: There are plenty of well-made suspenseful moments. The CGI is impressively inspiring. Cruise counties smashing his image as Mr. Handsome, enjoying disfiguring his face, to assure that he doesn't need his good looks to gain capability and popularity, as he did before in Born on the Fourth of July (1989), Interview with the Vampire (1994), Vanilla Sky (2001), and Tropic Thunder (2008). But he was the usual serious him, with a few exceptional moments, where the script granted him with precious material, like when he looked at his assistance, after winning Hitler's signature on the revised Valkyrie, with the most concealed victorious smile in his eyes. Bill Nighy won the best character around, the man who with and against the plot, and he did it with powerful imprint.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is pure thriller mixed with tepid documentary. It delivers the goods, but with undeniable disappointment; weather in terms of impossible happy end, or could-have-been possible dramatic satisfaction. It leaves you with more thrill than talks. While The Night of the Generals leaves you with more talks than thrill. Being unbalanced, in this part, is the main point of resemblance I meant between the 2 movies."

","It is no small feat on the part of director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie that 'Valkyrie' manages to keep increasing the tension as it goes despite the fact that the audience already know the outcome.<br/><br/>'Valkyrie' is artfully directed and beautifully shot. The costumes look authentic, and it eschews CGI cheats in favor of the real thing. Planes are real. Buildings are real. As a result, you become immersed in this place and time.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent. Cruise and the bulk of the non-German actors wisely avoid attempting accents. The anachronistic result takes some getting used to, but ultimately I believe it allows them to concentrate solely on their performance.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a taught thriller, and a bit of a history lesson, 'Valkyrie' is a film you must watch."

","One or probably the most famous hero in German history. Colonel Von Stauffenberg was just a simple man... A simple soldier who believed in the ideals of extending German lives. Although stationed in Tunisia he started to see the inexplicable blood stain from Hitler travel across his homeland like a plague.<br/><br/>Armed with partners in the highest offices of Berlin Stauffenberg then initiated a protocol known as 'Valkyrie' A single condition should the existing government lose its goal in war that a new government would be written in its place. Stauffenberg nearly succeeded in implementing this condition to a point that the SS itself was under arrest in a matter of days.<br/><br/>With the bombing of the Wolf's Lair where Hitler was conducting war tactics failed the reserve army that Stauffenberg had under his control was then given new orders by the surviving Hitler himself to arrest all government officials. Now as all party leaders escape from certain death... Key figures within the government also did not escape their fates whether involved or not.<br/><br/>I can call this film a great achievement when it comes to hero's. Just the fact that Stauffenberg had no strength, he had no special gifts, nor did he use weapons in the face of his enemy. He used his wits, intelligence, and audacious attitude to stopping a formidable disturbed man who needed to die. Although most in the government saw Hitler as a single most threat to their way of life... some thought of him as a Savior.<br/><br/>Yet it was the German people themselves who hated Hitler the most. Only the Hierarchy, and the families involved in the atrocities which followed them loved Hitler. His baseless attempts to stamp out the Jewish regimes, and the dissidents who helped them became virtual nightmares. For whatever reason Hitler had to start a war has always been a mystery.<br/><br/>Even though he himself was half Jewish by birth. No this movie held great aspects of the human condition. To see tyranny be stopped in its tracks only after the deaths of Stauffenberg, and his teams of hero's. IN Nuremberg. Where Goring, and Hess were sentenced to death after the trials against humanity. A plaque was even erected at the sight where Stauffenberg, and his team was executed by firing squad to recognize his achievement as a local hero to the people.<br/><br/>A great movie, excellent actors, and a wonderful look into the past at how Hitler almost met his demise at the hands of Germany's greatest Solider, and Family man.

","Although the Second World War should never be forgotten, it's fair to say that war movies are hardly big money-spinners at the box office right now. Perhaps it's because we're used to see the Allies winning in the end? However, Valkyrie is told from an entirely German perspective. It's the dying days of the war and Hitler is determined to fight until the last man, bringing down Germany if it comes to it. So a rouge group of German officers (led by Tom Cruise) stages a plan to assassinate him and arrange a truce with the Allies.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise can act, if given the right part. Here he doesn't have to do too much. He's largely here for 'star power' value. However, it's the story that's important rather than who's in it. Despite the fact that you'll probably know the ending, it's actually pretty tense as the Germans fight their own leader and try to bring a less devastating conclusion to the war.<br/><br/>Bonus points to the film for putting together a large group of some of the best British actors to play various German roles (and Eddie Izzard, who sneaked in there somehow - bless him).<br/><br/>If you fancy something a bit more historically accurate (and I'm told Valkyrie is reasonably accurate) then this is worth a go. Perhaps 'Downfall' (an excellent German-made film about Hitler's last days) could even be a sort of sequel to this?<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

","This film was ridiculed throughout its production, from the casting and lack of German accents to Cruise's eye patch - Valkyrie was to be the quick death of the rebooted MGM. A big budget disaster, that would destroy even more what Lions for Lambs did to MGM. Pulling in $200m worldwide, the film was successful enough in the box office and wasn't the critical disaster that many expected (or hoped for), though it hardly received love from critics. The film is a tight old fashioned thriller, with strong direction from Bryan Singer and a nice pulpy, no fat screenplay that doesn't waste a moment on the plot to kill Hitler. It's a quick history lesson with the framework of a thriller. So while the film is all surface and doesn't go deep, that's hardly a criticism and there's much to recommend here. Cruise is adequate, but it's the machinations of the plan that when put in action are nothing short of entertaining to watch - even though you know how it will end."
"ayden-walker","6","0","0","6 April 2014"," Where are the Germans?
","Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a Wehrmacht official who loses his left eye, right hand, and a couple of fingers on his left, after him and his troops are attacked by an air raid in Tunisia. He is evacuated back to Munich, where his wife, Nina (Carice van Houten), is waiting for him. After recovery, he is recruited by General Friedrich Olbricht into the German Resistance. It's here he meets other German officials and discusses with them a plot to assassinate Hitler, initiate Operation Valkyrie, accuse the SS of staging a coup, arrest all SS, Gestapo and Nazi officials, all the while officiating their own coup which will grant them power over Germany. Simple as that. <br/><br/>The first thing you will notice is that the dialogue is not in German, nor are the characters played by German actors. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard and numerous other English and American actors fill out the cast. Even Adolf Hitler himself is portrayed with a deep, brooding English accent. Although, for me, it did not seem unrealistic or bizarre in anyway, the film would have definitely benefited from the characters speaking their should-be natural dialect. Valkyrie could have been an epic, historical war film. Instead it's a safe, conventional B-movie that's borderline neo-noir. <br/><br/>The actors in this film deserve some credit though. I understand it must be hard to portray a German official whilst speaking English with a thick English/American accent, but thanks to fantastic production and costumes, Tom Cruise plays his character with suave and confidence. One actor who caught my eye was Jamie Parker. Parker plays Werner von Haeftena, an adjutant to von Stauffenberg who sticks by his side during the assassination attempt on Hitler, right until he literally takes a bullet for von Stauffenberg, in a heartwarming display of loyalty. Parker plays the most convincing German of the lot. He is only young, but his face shows bravery and austerity, and he is arguably the most likable character out of the Resistance. <br/><br/>The script is intelligent and engaging, although it never takes any risks. The actors, especially Tom Cruise, Bill Nighy, Jamie Parker and Eddie Izzard, are all talented enough to make the absence of German accent and dialect not seem ridiculous. Valkyrie is a good film, but perhaps it would have been better had German actors starred in it."

Sigel focused on red, the color of the Nazi flag, which he felt represented the violence of their ideology. Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration.

","A film with the presence of such fine actors as Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and yes Tom Cruise, would be expected to entertain, and this one certainly does. On its own, as a war thriller, it is perfectly understandable and interesting. But better yet, the film is scrupulously accurate with details of the plot, small details of the officers' uniforms (something at this late stage that every war film should get right, but which few do), and in general capturing the surrealistic air of 1940s Germany under the rule of a madman. Cruise has taken a lot of undeserved guff for his religious beliefs. What he chooses to believe is up to him. The bottom line is that he is a superb actor, and manages to convey the great strain that Colonel Stauffenberg must have felt as the plot moved forward. Here was an officer only recently escaped from death on the battlefield, having lost much blood, an arm, an eye, and parts of his remaining hand, yet doggedly pursuing his goal of rescuing the moral center of Germany. The oath a German officer takes has been described as a nearly physical bond, and Hitler had cleverly converted the Wehrmacht's oath into one given to him directly. Breaking such an oath is a painful thing to a German officer, even when the oath has been given to a monster. Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators had the courage to relinquish that oath in favor of a larger morality. In so doing, they saved the honor of Germany, even if in what in the end was a rather pathetic way. From that small seed of honorable behavior, among others (e.g. The White Rose) has grown today's democracy, the bulwark of a free Western Europe. This film would make a good double feature with ""Sophie Scholl, The Final Days""."

","The Stauffenberg plot was an attempt to assassinate Hitler, size power in Berlin, and end the war, and in 'Valkyrie' (which was the code name for the second part of the plan), a largely British cast (aided by Tom Cruise) attempt to tell the story. The scheme was well-planned, unlucky, and had it succeeded, many lives might have been saved. But Bryan Singer's movie suffers from some problems. Stauffenberg's heroic qualities are maximised (he's presented as the bravest, and furthest-sighted, member of the conspiracy, as if being the one who actually planted the bomb was not enough); and the complex motivation of German rebels against Hitler is simplified into anachronistic moral revulsion (which is not to say that the plotters didn't indeed think Hitler evil; but their view of the world was almost certainly a different one from the conventional contemporary judgement on the Nazis, which is how their thinking is represented here). There's some unimaginative direction as well: how many shots of a man in uniform throwing a cigarette butt on the ground does one movie need? Yet the natural power of the story is too great to be completely ruined by one director. These men were attempting to take a life, risking their own (with unknowable odds), and attempting to save millions. When the film ends with a quote from the German resistance memorial, it's hard not to be moved."

","Valkyrie is a great movie that shows some ignorant Americans that not all German were evil Nazis whom goal was to conquer the world during WWII. A few of them, like these list of characters in the film, didn't like how Adolf Hitler was taking Germany into a downward path, and try to do something about it, even if the overcome wasn't in their favor. Valkyrie is a great movie about the last attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler prior to the end of World War II. The film depicts the 20 July plot in 1944 by German army officers to assassinate Hitler and to use the Operation Valkyrie national emergency plan to take control of the country. Tom Cruise is pretty OK as the Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, who channels his anger at Hitler's (David Bamber) atrocities and mismanagement of the war by joining a secret organization bent on killing the Führer. Tom Cruise is pretty much acting like Tom Cruise here. He does try to speak German in the first 2 minutes of the film, but the film quickly turn to English to stop him from further butchering of the German language. In no way, does Tom Cruise even accept a German accent. In truth, little of the actors did. Some of the non-German actors initially experimented with German accents, but director Brian Singer discarded the idea, instead instructing them to adopt neutral accents that o it wasn't distract from the story"". Sorry, Brian, but it was a bit distracting. You never really get into the movie because of these inaccuracies. Listening to German officers & soldier speaking in British/American accents was unrealistic, you don't need to speak perfect German or even a strong German accent but when you have supposedly German officers/soldiers speaking in clear British/American accents, realism completely falls out the window. In the movie 1993's ""Schindler's list"" they spoke in English but at least in strong German accents so it didn't seem to fake, and look at how well that movie turned out, and how this movie didn't reach that success. I think a lot of criticize come from the fact, that at the time, Tom Cruise's personal life controversial was reaching a new high. Let me state that, I don't think anybody should hate this movie because Tom Cruise is an extreme scientologist. Him being a scientologist, have nothing to do with this film at all. Yes, scientology can seem like a cult following like the Nazis movement, but Tom Cruise is making a movie about not following a cult leader here. It was shocking to hear that the film makers had trouble finding German locations to film because of this. It didn't help that also portraying Nazism in Germany is also somewhat banned there. So to attack the movie just because of that fact that Tom belong to scientology is wrong, and stupid. As long as Tom Cruise does an OK performance, I will be happy to see any film from him. I hailed Cruise's professionalism. I just wish he did more to portray Stauffenberg. He still seem a bit off. My opinion, the role should had gone to Michael Fassbender. Another criticize from some critics is that it is predictable. History tells us the plot failed, of course, and Hitler killed himself months later. But that doesn't stop Cruise or director Bryan Singer from approaching the film as a thinking person's thriller, told from inside the conspirators' camp, where the outcome of their deeds were uncertain for several tense hours. It was create as if we were reliving history at the first time, we didn't know what happen to Adolf Hitler. Who knows, he could had die in the bomb accept and we wanted the heroes to success in their goal. The film made me invested in the characters. Sadly the experience falls short of any realism or authenticity to the point that some people find it dull and boring. I found it interesting at a point, but without the realistic German accent acting. It seem like a really stage play or something like that. I think the actors did a swell job. Some of them like supporting characters like Bill Nighy as General Friedrich Olbricht, Kenneth Branagh as Major General Henning von Tresckow and Tom Wilkinson as Colonel General Fredrich Fromm did amazing jobs standing out. While, Terence Stamp is awesome actor, his role as Colonel General Ludwig Beck is nearly forgettable until the end. I nearly forgot he was in the film. The production of the film went through hell with certain crew getting injury in an accident, and some of the film getting damage. While there is a number of historic accuracy, like historically, Stauffenberg first attempted to use his briefcase bomb at Berchtesgaden on July 15. It didn't hurt the film. What seems to be missed in the movie is Hitler's obsession with SS leader Himmler. It was Himmler that Code Valkyrie was directed against, because Himmler was the most likely candidate to assume power. Historians have not yet unraveled the linkage between Stauffenberg's preemptive activation of the Valkyrie plan and the dire threat that Himmler posed to Hitler during the war. The movie score and visuals were amazing. While the movie was finish early in 2008. The release date got confusing with United Artists changing the date to avoid playing during other big releases and didn't release the film until late 2008. It was a marketing nightmare. It got troubles in some towns in Germany due to its Nazi subject matter. In America, it came out with other related Nazi subject matters films such as 2008's the Reader and 2008's the Boy in the Striped Pajamas. It didn't help that it open on X-MAS, but at less it didn't flop. Overall: it was a good decent film. It did help renewed the topic of the German Resistance among the German populace. That's the most important thing."

Though Cruise is no stranger to historical films (The Last Samurai for example) the part of von Stauffenberg is a very complex man. After all, his true motives are clouded in mystery.<br/><br/>So does Cruise pull it off? Not really. The performance is decent, but if you compare with other performances in similar movies like Adrien Brody's pianist, or Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List. I suspect that the filmmakers know Cruise's limitations as well, since they have hired a stellar supporting cast including Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a surprisingly solid effort, and one of the better American war movies made in the 2000s. Since Americans are not really involved, the viewer is spared the usual patriotism and flag-waving so common in American war movies, instead the film focuses all-in on von Stauffenberg and his plot.

Despite this, Cruise is solid in the role and the story works up some quality suspense. Even though we know the plot will fail, you can't help but root for the dissenters' success. Almost 5000 Germans were subsequently executed on grounds of treason for the failed attempt, although not all of them were connected to this specific conspiracy.<br/><br/>The film is both entertaining and educational.

On balance I think this film has the better attitude but David Bamber does play Hitler with an English-German accent; this is not as good as Mike Gwilym in the TV movie with his bizarre Welsh-German accent. Hitler here is a little dispirited charisma-free man, and I don't find that portrayal convincing.<br/><br/>Stauffenberg is played here by Tom Cruise. Well, what can we say? He gives it his best shot.

All the time tom cruise looked highly confident, as he looked in Mission impossible. Another thing abt this movie, I often got feeling of watching American military not German military of WWII. Don't know why ? May be because everyone speaks American English in the version i watched. though i don't understand German. My expectation before watching movie was i wud be in the middle of WWII, inside German military where they are trying to assassin Hitler secretly. But while watching i never felt i was in WWII Germany. yet movie is good, if u watch without expectations, you will really enjoy."

","For those in the year 2011, still enamoured by the events of the second World War and the psychology of the human race including dictators, military men and civilians during that time period this film is a must watch.<br/><br/>The atmosphere resembles that of the second World War and at least the German officers are shown as human beings(even the most evil) and not zombies who want to destroy everything in their path. Even Hitler is depicted accurately and not too dramatically. Yes, technically, its not a perfect film because accents are not spot on, accurate and of course the language is English. But, it's a thriller film about doing the right thing and not really a documentary so it's meant to be entertainment.<br/><br/>It's understandable that it's with English dialogues and some American, English accents mixed in between. It's a basically a suspense, underdog attempting to defeat the powerful villain film and you end up putting yourself in the shoes of the characters who attempt the coup d'etat. You will go through the torrent of emotions they go through including fear, terror, uncertainty and bravery that could result in the firing squad being thrust in front of you."

","I adore German WWII history when I heard this was coming out I was very excited. I feel like a failure because it took me almost 3 years to watch it but it was worth the wait. It showed that all the SS were not horrible men. It showed that they loved their country enough not only to fight in a world war but enough to go against one of the most crazed men in the history of war. Among the few things that I noticed that were a bit strange is Clause and his wife both have dark curly hair. Their children are all blonde. I found this very confusing. Also the director seemed to focus on Claus's (Tom Cruise) glass eye. There at the very least two scenes that zoom in on it and focus. If it was to show what he had lost wouldn't the eye patch have been more appropriate to showcase. I also noticed they didn't really try to give Clause a prostetic hand. All in all it was very good and definitely worth the watch!"

","It was the plot that could have changed the course of the Second World War. On July 20th, 1944 a group of Germans opposed to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and led by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg detonated a bomb at Hitler's eastern front headquarters before they launched a coup. Bryan Singer's 2008 film Valkyrie is the Hollywood film that dramatizes that plot. Now for the big questions: is it a good history lesson and is it a good film? <br/><br/>Leading the film's cast is Hollywood actor Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. In a way Cruise was a perfect choice for the role as he bares a striking resemblance to the real life Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Other then that, Cruise seems to have been miscast in the role. Cruise has never been one of the world's greatest actors and in Valkyrie that fact is apparent. Though Cruise wisely underplays through much of the film but there are moments when he just seems to be overacting if not melodramatic at times such as when he screams ""Heil Hitler!"" at General Fromm or his overacted nervousness when setting the bomb. It doesn't help that Cruise is cast alongside some of the best character actors in the world which makes those very things all the more obvious. Cruise's performance then can all only be called mixed then.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is superb. There's the performance of the actors portraying Stauffenberg's various fellow conspirators including Bill Nighy as General Olbricht, Christian Berkel as Colonel von Quirnheim, Terence Stamp as General Beck, Eddie Izzard as Fellgiebel, Jamie Parker as Stauffenberg's adjutant and a short but memorable turn from Kenneth Branagh as General von Tresckow. Those imposing them include Tom Wilinson as the fence sitting General Fromm, Tom Hollander as the ever suspicious Colonel Brandt, Kenneth Cranham as Field Marshal Keitel and of course David Bamber as Hitler himself. There are also some good supporting performances from Carice van Houten as Stauffenberg's wife Nina and the various children who add a personal dimension to this historical event. The result is a well-acted film from most of its cast.<br/><br/>A historical film relies heavily on its production values to set the era and mood in which it is set. Both the production design and the costumes go a long way to establishing the reality of the film though of course there are moments (such as the church seen early in the film) when things are changed just a bit for dramatic effect. The cinematography of Newton Thomas Sigel, while not evocative of the era specifically, nevertheless does a fine job of giving the film a strong sense of atmosphere and mood, especially in the build up the plot's executions. The success of the film as a historical thriller is helped out immensely by one of the best scores to date from composer John Ottman who also does a good job editing the film as well. The production values are superb in their recreation of Second World War Germany and setting the mood of the film as a thriller.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is, first and foremost, a thriller albeit one with a historical setting. The script from Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander sets that out and director Bryan Singer uses it to the film's advantage. Once the film first ten minutes or so that shows us both Stauffenberg's questioning of Hitler and his injury in North Africa, the film becomes a constantly tense piece of work as first one plot fails, then planning begins on another plot and onwards the film goes. It's a film well-suited to Singer and even better is that, as a film, it is a well written thriller as well.<br/><br/>The question remains though: is it a good history lesson? For the most part it is just that and it's a serious one at that. It gets across what the plot was, what it set out to do and who the men were behind it all. It shows the moments of moral uncertainty, indecision and at times downright misfortune that threatened the plot and its plotters. Being a film it of course condenses more then a year's worth of events into two hours and this means that certain events (such as Stauffenberg drawing inspiration for the plot from listening to Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries which the real Stauffenberg disliked) are created for dramatic purposes. For the most part though the film accurately portrays events as they happened albeit in condensed form.<br/><br/>So does Valkyrie succeed as both a film and as a history lesson then? For the most part the answer is yes to both questions. Yet the miscasting of Tom Cruise in the all important role of Colonel von Stauffenberg is something that hurts the film quite a bit. As a result the film is a good one but one wonders if it couldn't have been better somehow. But as a historical thriller, there's no doubt that Valkyrie is a success."

","I didn't pay much attention when this came out in theatres. The entertainment media kept calling it a 'troubled' production and there was the usual skewering of Tom Cruise because of his religion, erratic behaviour, etc. But if you just put all that nonsense aside and watch the movie you'll see a well crafted, well acted film.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of the German resistance and their last recorded attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler it proves to be quite thrilling. At first the movie seems to be a Tom Cruise vehicle with every shot highlighting the star's ever move. But as the film progresses it becomes more about the plot, the various things that 'could' go wrong and did.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh is hardly in the film but he gets shown in the promotional posters. He plays his tiny part really well. Watch his facial expressions as he sits uncomfortably in the military office, wondering whether or not his secret has been revealed. It's an awesome piece of acting.<br/><br/>Cruise is a lot more limited in his range. You can recognize his various looks from far away including his 'determined' face, his 'giving orders' face, and his 'struggling with something' face. The role allows him to show all that. His performance is adequate but pales next to his costars.<br/><br/>Great pacing, decent plot (surprisingly much of it really happened as it appears in the film) and great performances by all the supporting cast along with a decent performance by Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>8/10"

","A good film about the Von Stauffenberg plot, the conspiracy that almost succeeded in killing Adolf Hitler during the later stages of World War II. It doesn't start very promisingly: things happen fast (we have Von Stauffenberg severely injured in a battle in North Africa, losing an arm, three fingers and an eye, and a few minutes later we have him joining the conspiracy, without explaining very well his motivations) and characters are introduced hastily without explaining well who they are. But as the movie progresses and we get into the plot itself (which was more than about killing the Fuhrer; knowing that that wouldn't be enough to end Germany's dreadful situation, they also have a complicated plan to take power and be able to sue the allies for peace in terms that would not be disastrous for Germany), it gets more and more gripping with a superb final hour. The mostly British cast here (among them, Terence Stamp, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy), acquit themselves very well. Tom Cruise, however, while not a disaster, is just not very believable as a German officer. Besides his limited acting range, his demeanor has always been very American, so he is just not very believable playing people from other countries. I can think of other actors who could have been great in this role: for example, Thomas Kretschmann, who plays a Major who has a key role in breaking the coup attempt, could have been a great Von Stauffenberg. Still, this was better than expected as director Bryan Singer (of the X-Men franchise) certainly knows how to make a gripping, entertaining movie. And the movie includes also some terrific aviation scenes using period planes."

Tom Cruise gives one of his best and most subtle performances in years. You'll honestly forget its Tom Cruise at all. This movie is about more than just a plot to kill Hitler. It is about loyalty to a set of ethics and principles that were upheld by very few at that point in time. It is about having the courage to act when no one else would. This is an incredibly important story, because these brave men need to be remembered. They died for their country, the Germany before Hitler. This movie will creep up and floor your emotions in ways you won't see coming, and you'll be hard pressed to stop thinking about it.

Tom Cruise, while he may not be the kind of guy you like in public, is a wonderful actor. I have enjoyed every film he's done. Valkyrie has to be his Oscar worthy role to date. (I was shocked he wasn't even nominated while those who were failed in comparison). Tom was powerful. when he spoke his posture and attitude resembled that of a soldier in that time period. And when he didn't speak he was emotional, his facial expressions speaking for him. The guy he portrays was a war vet and still is a soldier. In the opening of the film he loses an eye and a hand. But the guy is still active in the military, and carries himself as if he wasn't even a cripple. Throughout the film he is pushed to the limit but carries through that sticks to me with awe. Great film and ending with the words ""Long live free Germany"" (or something like that) right before a firing squad. Yeah, Tom Cruise looks crazy. But let's be fair film association! The guy was Oscar-worthy in a performance that reminds you of the fallen soldiers who fought to eliminate Hitler. I give the film a 9/10, because even with the greatest film, there are flaws here and there. But a high rating because for a film about history, it keeps you watching it until the end. Watch it and judge for yourself."

","Though not a huge financial success, Valkyrie was certainly not the bomb that many predicted for months leading up to its release. There were problems during shooting with extras being seriously injured, problems in post-production leading to re-shoots. And of course the worst bad buzz inducing thing of all... the release date kept getting moved around. Had Tom Cruise's career finally come to an end??? That is really all we heard in 2008. Though Cruise does not seem to possess the box office clout he once had, it is actually nice to see him begin to transition himself into roles where he can actually play someone in particular. Not just be himself.<br/><br/>Cruise plays Col Claus von Stauffenberg, a decorated German combat officer highly critical of Hitler's war effort as the tide begins to turn during WWII. Stauffenberg was clearly not alone in military circles who were outraged at the actions of the SS and certainly knew Hitler had bitten off more than his armies could chew while running roughshod over Europe. After losing an eye, a hand, and some fingers on the other hand during action in Africa, Stauffenberg then devotes himself to joining with other like-minded officers and civilians to overthrow the increasingly eccentric dictator. Singer and company weave a tight and suspenseful story that looks authentic and isn't difficult to follow. And it is quite a feat to keep an audience on edge even when you know how things turned out in the end. Well, maybe with our lack of history in public schools these days, the younger generation might not know the ending. But try getting them to watch anything without 3D CGI anymore.<br/><br/>The film does a decent enough job of re-creating Berlin at the time. So much so that the filmmakers came under fire for using so many Nazi symbols. These may have been toned down in post=production as some media types here in the states claimed that there weren't enough of them visible. There is also the question of how much the film glosses over the Holocaust taking place concurrently. Just how much did these people know? Stauffenberg in the opening scene remarks into his journal about the killing of Jews, and later plans on closing the concentration camps after the new government has assumed command. But really, not much else is said about this issue. Really at the end of the day, Valkyrie is just a good historical thriller. Of course these work best for those of us who don't know every detail about the actual events and can swallow the Hollywood touches a little more easily. 8 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

The only complaint that I have about this movie is that you already know how it is going to end, but even with that, it still had me just as sad to see it happen. And to anyone who refuses to see this due to Tom Cruise: Get a life, and don't judge actors on their personal life. Just because someone may think differently than you does not mean that they aren't a good actor. Tom Cruise happens to play the part perfectly.

","It bothers me just how often Tom Cruise is screwed out of the recognition he should get for being such a truly talented actor. Even more so when he's in a film that's as well directed, well written and well performed as this film is.<br/><br/>This film is Cruise's best, and most understated, performance since Collateral and The Last Samurai. And to say that against the performances of this film's cast shows the kind of actor Cruise is. Straight from the beginning of the film with his being conflicted over joining the operation - the scene in the cellar with his family is particularly noteworthy for that and Bryan Singer's excellent skills as a director - to his recruiting. ""I'm involved in high treason with all means available to me. Can I count you in?"" Perhaps Cruise's best scene and a small example of just how good the writing of this film is. Chris McQuarrie's and Nathan Alexander's work is brilliant. ""Any problem on this earth can be solved with the careful application of high explosives."" Singer's directing of this film is as brilliant as McQuarrie and Alexander's writing. His handling of the different motivation of these men was very well done and made the story in my opinion. His casting - the actor playing Hitler was particularly well done. Other directors could learn from Singer's attention to detail - to the point where Cruise was standing in the exact spot the actual Stauffenberg was executed.<br/><br/>Valkyrie is the best film of 2008 by far and the fact that it wasn't nominated, or won, the Oscar's that it deserves shows just how sorry a state the academy is in."

","The camera slowly, tantalisingly zooms in on a spinning record whilst bombs are falling all around the building the contraption is in; our lead and his family helplessly cowering in a basement as the loud and proud emoting of Wagner's 'The Ride of the Valkyries' booms out of the gramophone when the rumble from another explosion pushes the needle back onto the track. It's an important sequence, the scene in which whilst down there in that basement taking cover from the very bombs designed to injury him as he figures out a way to aid those they belong to, our lead hits upon the idea of enforcing an operation; a plan that might bring about the ending of World War Two, thus saving hundreds of thousands of lives, but at the risk of his own. It's a powerful moment, one that gives our lead an idea, impetus and strength within an individual happening designed to maim and destroy. Such is the nature of the lead, showing strength through adversity; like all of those that were members of whichever resistance movement in whatever nation at that time.<br/><br/>And from whence the thriller Valkyrie gets its name is revealed, a 2009 Bryan Singer film about the true story revolving around a certain man named Claus von Stauffenberg, a German colonel in the upper throngs of the Nazi party during World War Two, who took it upon himself to wipe out Adolf Hitler in a bid to have the German political hierarchy thrust into chaos as The War chugged into a fifth year. The film sees Singer return to material of a Nazi orientated nature for the first time since 1998's Apt Pupil, another rather terrifying drama, that time about a young boy becoming gradually more and more obsessed with a specific text in The Holocaust as themes of blackmail and the exploiting of power one supposedly possesses over another person, the likes of which the young boy had been reading of, became more frighteningly apparent.<br/><br/>In Valkyrie, another look at the dangers or misuse of power is observed; the determination of Tom Cruise's von Stauffenberg in achieving what it is he wants so dear by way of knowing he can be in such close proximity to an individual of such infamous nature is played out, an advantage he utilises so as to put a plan of action into motion. Others are connected, a flurry of British actors curiously both hovering and revolving around American Cruise's whim, all of whom playing true to life German officials that want an end to the madness and murder as Hitler prolongs the deaths of the innocent and those serving on the various fronts of The War. They know the risks; they know their mission and they're aware of what it'll take of them when the scene in a church sees von Stauffenberg talk to Bill Nighy's general, a certain Friedrich Olbricht, for the first time about the idea of trying to initiate operation Valkyrie plus ideas about how setting out in eliminating a man is still a mere act of murder. Indeed, later on Olbricht observes that while they're doing their best to save lives and end suffering: ""only God can judge us""; the theological elements of following through with this mission made aware.<br/><br/>Cruise's von Stauffenberg is a battle scarred man, weary of the war and an individual with experience of the front line when an attack on his desert troops in Tunisia by an American Flying Tiger fighter plane leaves him without a right hand and a left eye. His wife is Nina (van Houten), her and their children those whose lives we feel are in greatest danger when he is away and indulging in his plans; here Singer using the innocent lives of von Stauffenberg's family to act as representatives for those of the greater nature of who'll be saved if the plan succeeds. One scene sees von Stauffenberg attempt to call home by way of the telephone, but recent bombing has made communication difficult as von Stauffenberg's situation becomes increasingly precarious. He places the phone down and it hangs ominously on the receiver, teetering as if on a cliff edge; rocking back and forth as a photograph of his family stare back at us with the phone in the foreground: the outcome of their situation remains unanswered and certain fates of the von Stauffenberg family remain in the balance as the phone continues to rock as if to dramatically become unhooked at any moment.<br/><br/>The film covers his gradual infiltration of Hitler's Nazi party higher members, and his consequent invitation to the heavily fortified Wolf's Lair, located deep in rural Germany, in which the strike will eventually occur; an idea met with some disdain from certain people early on, particularly Tom Wilkinson's Friedrich Fromm, when Singer applies a number of profile shots of men facing each other in a showing of anger, disagreement and confrontation. His direction is taut and punchy, taking a true story of which few will have heard of but mostly all will know the result of within seconds of it being detailed, the film's expositional tidbits from fully grown men explaining plans and complicated political procedures and agendas to one another harmlessly inter-cutting with the pot-boiling and execution of this plan to leave an awry suitcase in a dangerous place. The key to the drama is not knowing the outcome of von Stauffenberg and several of his cohorts, nor how it was they went about dealing with the situations they created. Singer's treatment of the material in that punchy, rapid fashion renders it accessible for more mainstream audiences without ever really degrading it or exploiting it for cheap entertainment's worth. The film is a tight and focused effort, involving in its own right and efficient in retelling a story of failure that needs not be forgotten."

This is the only film that you may know nothing about but still know how it's going to end. Bryan Singer, who made the only good ""X-Men"" films, does a good job by making a film seem like there is a lot of action in it but realistically it's just a bunch of close-ups of Tom Cruise looking constipated. Mr. Singer didn't cast Mr. Cruise for his acting ability but rather for his presence or quite simply his star power. This was supposed to be Tom Cruise's comeback movie after the commercial failure of ""Mission Impossible 3"". At best, this movie achieved lukewarm reviews from critics to audience alike. Watching this movie you realize why Tom Cruise is an action star and not known for his dramatic performances even though he had a few. Tom Cruise may look just like the person he is playing but you got to wonder if this film could have been better if anyone else played his role, for example Leo?

","There will be a lot of specific spoilers in this review, but hiding the plot in an historically-based movie is like trying not to tell that the boat went down in ""Titanic."" This household is made of of a couple of film geeks, and one lay expert in German 20th-century military history, so you're warned.<br/><br/>I perked up when the film began with a translation of the original Hitler Oath running across the screen (search ""Hitler_Oath"" on Wikipedia). The oath was central to the hesitation caused in the officer corps after the Attentat (attempted assassination). The director had my attention.<br/><br/>In our household, we enjoy Tom Cruise as an actor. I personally think he's funny, in a very restrained, rather sly, self-referential way. He's also extremely tightly wound. Directors who seem to know how to use him cast him to play very tightly-wound characters, and are not disappointed. Von Stauffenberg was a badly-wounded man, with all the delayed stress, pain and frustration that entails, and he yearned desperately to stop his beloved country from falling any further down the cliff it had already flung itself off of. He was a traditional German officer, a class that had been trained in extreme self-restraint, right down to their posture (""Haltung.""). I expect any actor playing him to be very upright in physical and moral stance, but to be barely repressing rage and pain. Who better than Cruise? <br/><br/>Moments of humor include Cruise throwing his eyeball into Eddie Izzard's drink to get his attention (We didn't recognize Izzard until we saw his name in the credits, and madly hunted the DVD to get another look at his performance. With no more disguise than a pair of glasses and a flat expression, Izzard hid in plain sight. What a chameleon!) Another moment is when von Stauffenberg turns and snaps the Hitler Salute at Tom Wilkinson (Fromm). Of course Fromm made a huge mistake; a man missing a hand and most of his fingers would no more have been expected to salute than he would have been expected to hurry while changing his shirt. Besides, saluting Hitler with a handless arm was an outright insult. Von Stauffenberg more or less told Fromm to go have intercourse with himself. Loudly.<br/><br/>Marvelous minor performances include the officer of the reserve army, with his frustrated sigh of ""Assemble the men,"" and his snapped, ""WE're the coup, you idiot!"" And the sergeant at the Wolf's Lair, who perfectly mimes Military Fear that causes him to make a terrified decision not to touch that empty telephone. His performance is accurate, right down to the nervous head-shake. Watch for the whole crew of the teletype message-transfer center, trying desperately not to get themselves -- and their families -- killed if they make the wrong choice (I was a military teletypist in the '70's and it was all spookily familiar, right down to the message-checking and the sound of the raving keys).<br/><br/>I've studied the German army in the period intensively, and I can say the sets, costumes, etc., were beautifully done. The use of the red swastika flags reflect the original use of them in the Third Reich, whose artists and film designers knew what would look good on the screen. Von Stauffenberg's wife is portrayed as faultlessly fashionable. Germany had conquered France, but the French fashion industry refused to be crushed, as a form of very French protest. With access to this industry, wives of high-caste German military officers were expected to maintain a highly fashionable appearance as a form of patriotism; to have appeared in old or cheap dresses would have been to accuse the regime of being unable to keep up the populations's surface standard of consumerism.<br/><br/>The music was more Stravinsky than the thin and upbeat love-songs and military marches that were allowed in the Third Reich, but at least we're allowed samples of those original tunes. It would have been fun to hear some of the fake swing from the official jazz bands that were supported to compete with Allied broadcasts.<br/><br/>We know how this would end, but we were on the edges of our seats (well, couch and rocking-chair) all the way through. There was a real attempt to show the terror Germans lived while under this government, although it might have been more real to show how the regime began to insanely clean house, killing thousands of people in and out of the officer corps. As a World War One Austrian soldier, Hitler hated the German officer corps, and wouldn't have held back if he'd had the chance to get them, even as he cleaned out the very soldiers who fought the war. Not the first -- or last time -- personal or political considerations would cripple an army.<br/><br/>I could bore for England about the history and how it relates to this movie; again, excellent research.<br/><br/>The cute use of the MGM logo, small and silver, at the end of the credit roll: it looks exactly like the cockade, oak leaves and silver strap on a German officer's cap. Yes, we got the joke, so whoever pulled it, it wasn't in vain.<br/><br/>Then again...the MGM lion logo came before the modern German cap design. We've been comparing the logo and the cockade design more and more. And remembering the Third Reich hired artists. Who can always get past censors with a little clever design. Did ""Valkyrie"" point out an old joke the artists pulled on the Nazis a long time ago? It would be fun to think so."

","This movie starred Tom Cruise as Tom Cruise and I had to rewind a few times to get the plot. I also had to do a bit of Googling as Im not overly familiar with this time period. It served as an enjoyable learning experience. I do like Tom Cruise and I did enjoy the movie. It was shot in a suspenseful manner with good dialogue. <br/><br/>If only General Friedrich Olbricht had given the order Valkyrie sooner then maybe the takeover would have been completed before news of Hitler being alive. Also, they were expected to meet in a concrete building where the bomb would do more damage. Instead they met in a wooden structure where the blast was less powerful. If the meeting place was as planned it wouldn't have mattered if General Friedrich Olbricht had given the order Valkyrie late because Hitler would have been dead."

","I have to give credit for a pretty detailed, largely step by step account, detailing the machinations leading up to the July 20, 1944 attempt by a group of Army officers to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power in Germany, as well as for offering much detail about the aftermath of the failed attempt, and the ultimate collapse of the coup. Beginning with Col. Claus von Stauffenberg being recruited into the group of conspirators, and ending with his execution, the movie revolves around him, and its title is taken from orders issued to the German Reserve Army to seize control of Berlin on Hitler's death (""Operation Valkyrie."") <br/><br/>If you are at all interested in this period of history (and why else watch this movie) you won't find anything particularly surprising in this, and there certainly isn't any suspense about the outcome. It's simply a pretty good documentation of it. The history is decent enough. I personally think that the movie exaggerated Stauffenberg's role in the coup attempt (and even more his authority over it.) Still, there's no doubt that he was an important figure and deserved to be centre-stage in this dramatization of it. Tom Cruise was an interesting choice to play Stauffenberg. He did well with the part, although Cruise as a German officer (even as an anti-Nazi German officer) was a bit of a stretch. <br/><br/>In a broad sense, the July 20 plot wasn't especially consequential. Hitler survived, the War went on and the conspirators were executed. Not a lot really changed because of this. The plot did, however, make it obvious to everyone (including the German people) that there was active opposition to Hitler at high levels. The reasons for the opposition were varied, but as much as we might like to think so had little to do with moral qualms about Hitler's or Nazi ideology, and almost everything to do with the belief that Hitler and the Nazis were leading Germany to destruction by mismanaging the war. So, was Stauffenberg the hero the movie makes him out to be? Hard to say, but he certainly deserves his place in history. 8/10"

","Recap: A dramatization of the events leading up to, and after July 20 Assassination Plot to kill Hitler and install a new government. Count Colonel Stauffenberg returns to Berlin after being severely wounded, with growing doubts of the war and Hitler's government. He joins a group of highly ranked officers that conspire to overthrow Hitler and end the war. The operation centers on the contingency plan Valkyrie that is to be activated if Führer is dead. The plan is to assassinate the entire leadership with a bomb, planted by Stauffenberg himself, and claim that rouge elements of the SS is behind the coup. Then, with the aid of the army, they must take control of Berlin.<br/><br/>Comments: Based on actual events, and from what I can tell it is pretty true to the actual event, even if some parts must have been dramatized either because of effect or because of uncertainty of what really happened. Either way the story really works well as an action-thriller, with or without connecting it to the real events. It's dramatic, it got a lot of tension and some twists as well.<br/><br/>And for once I really thought that Tom Cruise acted well again. He has done many good movies, but in the last few years I haven't been impressed at all. In Valkyrie he shows that he hasn't lost it all. But maybe what impresses me most is that they honor the true events in such detail. Right down to the cast, they have managed to assemble a highly merited and veteran cast with many respected and well known actors and still keeping that the actors actually should resemble the person they are acting as. Cruise and Steuffenberg is does really resemble each other, and so does Nighy and Olbricht, Stamp and Beck, Wilkinson and Fromm and so on. It gives the movie a certain edge in credibility and plausibility.<br/><br/>Enjoying the war genre, it is not hard to like Valkyrie. But it actually accomplishes to be both entertaining and interesting, in such a way that I had to check what really happened (and discover how true it seem to be). Actually a high level of infotainment. Recommended for everyone with the least interest in war movies or recent history. Or hopefully both.<br/><br/>7/10"

","The release of 'Valkyrie (2008)' was clouded by all sorts of overblown controversy regarding Tom Cruise's personal life, so it was perhaps fortuitous that it took me a year to finally watch it, allowing a period in which the dust could settle. All in all, Bryan Singer's film deserves some recognition; his storytelling style harks back to the 1970s, when filmmakers like Alan J. Pakula were crafting intelligent, slow-burning thrillers. In recounting the failed July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, the film avoids the anachronistic use of contemporary visual flourishes, gracefully recreating events with a strong emphasis on historical detail.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, whose screen persona is usually enough to dominate any film, is surprisingly understated in the lead, his character that of a calm, determined strategist. Colonel von Stauffenberg is driven by ideals, particularly his belief in a ""sacred Germany,"" but the film explores these motivations only peripherally. Instead, 'Valkyrie' is concerned with the mechanics of the July 20 plot; that is, what does it take to overthrow a dictatorship? Singer directs the action as one directs pieces in a chess-game, using Stauffenberg and his co- conspirators as willing pawns in an attempted coup that proved resourceful but ultimately impotent.<br/><br/>Seasoned players Tom Wilkinson, Kenneth Branagh, Billy Nighy and Terence Stamp are excellent in supporting roles. Wilkinson is particularly good: his General Friedrich Fromm stands on the fence between Hitler and the plotters, sensing that the powers are soon to shift, but stubbornly refusing to commit himself until his indecision returns to punish him. Throughout the film, Singer constructs a number of tense suspense sequences centred around the assassination plot. However, despite everybody's best efforts, it is often difficult for the viewer to fully commit to the characters and their scheme, since we already know how the story ends. Like Fromm, I suppose, one finds himself unwilling to pledge allegiance to what is inevitably the losing side."

","I just finished watching Valkyrie at home after seeing it once in the theatre. I liked it just as much, good acting very good action scenes, intensly believable. The sets were very authentic as were the clothes, radios, furniture etc. If I had any complaints about the movie it would fall with Tom Cruise, his voice throughout the movie is spoken in no more than a whisper making it hard sometimes to tell what he is saying. Also I think his character as a German count and aristocrat would have come across more authentic had he used a good prussian accent. This movie is a keeper Im glad I bought it.

Except, I don't know any other movie where there is continuous talk, yet keeps you entertained.<br/><br/>Valkyrie was truly outstanding. I'm no super film-critic, and I don't really look at the technical aspects of films, unless its extremely obvious (e.g Cloverfield is crap), but this movie, under my standards, really delivered. It had a good cast, with some great scenes here and there. Its obviously been made for people with interests in the WW2 era and the NAZI regime in particular, and it would be understandable that any non-historian would not be interested in this, but I can honestly say that this is a great flick for any regular movie watcher.<br/><br/>I think what really makes this movie a hit, is the suspense. We get the idea that Hitler is real bad, so any opposition to him will inevitably end with a death sentence. However, despite all this, brave NAZI officers worked at ending his regime once and for all. It was the suspense of those officers getting caught that kept my eyes stuck facing the TV, and the possibility that they could have been blown at any time and at so many occasions. Like I said previously, the means of delivering this suspense is through talking. In most movies with suspense and action, the 'hit' is delivered through guns, bullets, tanks etc., and that can get boring, but this movie is different, and in a good way! Valkyrie was a great movie overall, and I think its fair to say that an 9/10 would be the best score for it."

The supporting acting performances from Kenneth Branagh, Eddie Izzard, Tom Wilkinson, and the aforementioned Nighy & Stamp also failed to kill me with thespian excellence, even though I am giving these acclaimed actors the benefit of the doubt because they were given such a convoluted script.

","MOVIE. Im not a great fan of Tom Cruise but for political thrillers ""Valkyrie"" it's Tom Cruises best movie since ""a few good men"" in 1993 but it's also his best movie. I was impressed the movie was better than I anticipated. 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>HISTORY. Stories about the German resistance are too long overdue but there is an institutionalised agenda to limit or even stop public awareness about them. I don't believe the director realises the door to history that has been inadvertently opened with ""Valkyrie"" and it 's historical impact. The most crucial part of the movie is the bomb plot on 20 July 1944 and the political coup. The bomb plot occurred on the last day of ""operation good wood"" on 20 July 1944 when the allies began to break out of the DDay lodgment area. Although inferred in the movie is the grave mistake made by a German officer not portrayed in the movie whom failed to make certain the Valkyrie codes had the ""highest priority"" when orders were communicated to the German army or wehrmacht. Consequently, when the conspirators put operation Valkyrie into effect the wehrmacht also received orders from Fuhrer HQ or Adolf Hitlers headquarters to counter Valkyrie and this is where the plot came unstuck. Had the Valkyrie codes been given the ""highest priority"" the wehrmacht would have ignored any further communications from Adolf Hitlers HQ and the conspirators probably would have succeeded.<br/><br/>COSTUMES/PROPS. Although the producers claimed to make a considerable effort with costumes and authenticity i was disappointed here. Soldiers were often seen wearing a dark green mark 1940 pattern combat helmet which matches more closely the color of post war West German border police of the 1960's rather than 1944 field Grey tones. In 1944 the long boots worn by soldiers had largely disappeared and were replaced by ankle boots with British like gaiters. The K98 bolt action rifle although still in use was not too prominent in 1944 because German soldiers were being issued semi-automatic rifles instead including the worlds first assault rifle the MP44 and the Gewehr43 rifle. There was also the Gewehr 41 made by either Walther or Mauser which saw combat in Normandy. Some of the props were below expectation and appeared to ruin an excellent movie the worst of which was the outer checkpoint for the ""Wolf's Lair"" where a cheap shack and sand bags were included in the set and where soldiers were wearing the wrong uniforms. <br/><br/>EDITING. The editing could have made a huge impression on the audience if there were and should have been more ""long"" shots in the movie. Long shots particularly of Von Stauffenburg and his Ajutant Leutenant Haeften should have been used to emphasise the grand German architecture of the 1940's wartime to make the audience feel they're in Nazi Germany.This could have been achieved showing the two main characters, the colonel and his adjutant, walking the staircases to Hitlers residence or the ministry with guards in dress uniform at attention. Modern computer graphics like that used in King Kong to reconstruct a 1930's New York or Chicago could have been useful here too.<br/><br/>CAST. High profile British and American actors probably did this movie a great justice ""selling it"" to a world wide audience. However, the German actors that were cast did an excellent job and looked the part in their roles too. The only role i didn't like was the role of General Keitel played by a British actor with a horrible British accent and was obese and looked like the drunk grandfather Dingle from the British soap Emmerdale.Yuk. <br/><br/>Valkyrie, is a very good movie breaking historical ground."

","I didn't find anything here that i wasn't expecting, and nothing i expected to be here was absent. This is a bad premise to commenting on a movie. The thing is, i don't expect much of Bryan Singer. Yes, he gave us ""usual suspects"" which has some narrative interest in how the flashbacks are used and in how we redefine all that we'd seen with the final twist. But even there the direction was stylish, which means he chose effect over meaning, appearance over flesh. But clearly he is one of those guys who gets carried away by his immense enthusiasm, but than doesn't have the brain to bend his emotions to a coherent structure. Like him, so do think most of the common film goers, especially those who would flock to a movie like this. So, we have a box office success.<br/><br/>But if you want to go further, you'll find very little to interest you here. The one thing that matters is the story itself. What these guys tried to make was big, not because of the act in itself (certainly many Germans would want to do the same if they could) but because they were privileged Germans, who could just play the Nazi game. Of course by than the end of the war was close and they felt that, so killing Hitler might also be a way to protect the future of those who were around him. In any case, it was a brave attempt. But that can be told by a simple documentary, like the one in the extras of this DVD. The film is a mere illustration of the events. It's like those re enactments of historical facts in the History channel docs, with a (much) higher budget. But apart from that it is pretty useless, except for a minor entertainment value.<br/><br/>Well, the writers tried to build on the tension by not allowing us to understand or check Hitler after the bomb exploded. That tension is mildly well done, because it elects a narrator, it makes us live the lives of the dissidents. But we knew what had happened, so even that fails.<br/><br/>After the incredible participation of Cruise in Tropic Thunder, i would expect he would keep redeeming his career, but here he goes back to his usual numb thing. Pity.<br/><br/>If you go for ""realistic"" sets and good illustrations, i think this will do it perfectly for you.

","First of all, I have to confess I highly evaluate Tom Cruise's talent as an actor. In many films of his, I thought that he is not only a superstar but a good actor, ex. in Rain Man (1988), Eyes Wide Shut (1999), The Last Samurai (2003), Collateral (2004), in all of which he was not a hero but an ordinary man who is worried, hurt but finds a way to go. Above all, it is a miracle to continue to be in great hits for more than 20 years! Nevertheless, why does this part (Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg) not suit him?<br/><br/>That may be because the English language is not suitable for the German historical events. The sound and intonation of the German language is essential for those (please do not think that I urge the German language has a bad image, I found it one of the most beautiful languages when I repeatedly watched ""Das leben der anderen""(2006)). And the English spoken by Tom Cruise is too American. At the very beginning, Tom Cruise narrates the diary of Colonel Stauffenberg in German for a while, but it does not sound genuine German. (Tom, you have deserved an Oscar since a long time ago! Why don't you speak any European language with the perfect accent and intonation like Meryl Streep? Then that would definitely give you one.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, the English language also brought us many other advantages, in particular, the many attractive supporting actors, such as Bill Nighty (superb in the last scene!), Terence Stamp (great throughout the film!), David Schofield (speaking most impressively the historically famous statements in the court). Only Kenneth Branagh should have appeared more, it is really a shame that such a talented actor is not made best use of.<br/><br/>In addition, it is really good for Hollywood, instead of the German cinema, to declare that there were many Germans against the Nazi even during the war period.<br/><br/>Other actors, who could even have corresponded to the German language, are also very attractive. Carice van Houten is just a fine wife of a German colonel. Thomas Kretschmann is always a beautiful German officer who makes us believe he must be a good and thoughtful man (but he must be tired of playing such a role so many times).<br/><br/>I really love the last scene followed by the beautiful ending music, and want to see it repeatedly to memorize human being's dignified spirit to try to correct the wrong way to go."

This was a serious moment in history and the presentation was excellent. <br/><br/>What was missing? Suspense and tension. In real life, when this was actually going on, I am sure there were suspense and tension stretching to unbelievable lengths. But, not in here. Pity. That could have helped make this a little more than a history lesson and give us a real sense of dire consequences for the participants in the plan to kill Hitler. <br/><br/>The pace of the movie was too fast to achieve suspense and tension as the scenes did move at a somewhat rapid pace.

The movie was filled with high drama, good action, great directing and acting. From a cinematography point of view it was visually stunning. This was one of Tom Cruise's best performances. I feel he often gets a bad rap because of his Scientology views, and I heard reports that the German government was not happy he was filming Valkyrie because Scientology is banned in Germany & he's not the most popular person there.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I would've liked to see more German actors. There's a wealth of great German actors who speak English and who would've been more authentic in the main roles, but it seems like in most movies with Europeans the main roles are usually given to Brits. Nevertheless, the acting was superb especially from Cruise & Nighy.<br/><br/>If you're not a Cruise fan, don't let that stop you from seeing this. If nothing less, it gives a good look at the often neglected German side of WWII, showing that most Germans were against Hitler and the atrocities he committed against the world."

","I have studied this part of history. And knew about this assassination attempt. I somehow would have liked to have also seen some mention of Marshall Enrich Rommel. He was arrested after this and took poison instead. <br/><br/>I thought Tom Wilkinson was great as General Fromm. He displayed the strength of character I associated with Fromm. I just found Tom, although I am a fan, could have been appeared more forceful, yet he displayed the vulnerability of his position. However, the special features following the film on DVD were very illuminating. And the physical likeness of the main characters was very good. <br/><br/>Just can't get Bill Nighy's performance in 'Love Actually' out of my mind. <br/><br/>But I watched it twice, so couldn't have been that bad a film for me to do that. The German actors were very good, and Bill Nighy, and Kenneth Branagh, somehow like Tom's character appeared to me to lack toughness. <br/><br/>Now I saw Albert Speer in the credits. Yet couldn't place him in the plot? When Tom was walking to the Wolf's Lair, somehow his body language didn't seem to display the military presence or determination of what he was about to do. My thoughts of course. Overall I gave it 7."

","Well, how excellent and disconsolate was that? First of all, Valkyrie (or, 'The film in which the most evil man in history triumphs over the protagonists, effectively ensuring the further deaths of millions of people worldwide, hooray') heralds the return of the indubitably talented Tom Cruise in his first role worth watching since 2004's Collateral. Secondly, Valkyrie is directed by Bryan Singer, who after purposely destroying most of Superman Returns remembers that he is actually a brilliant director, not a terrible one, and drops the comic books in favour of exploring the original man influenced by the idea of Nietzsche's Übermensch, Adolf Hitler. Thirdly, there is no happy Hollywood ending. Hitler is not killed, the war does not end, and none of the conspirators get away with it. They are all unceremoniously executed. How refreshing.<br/><br/>The story is everything in Valkyrie. The plot concerns Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) and a resistance of like-minded civilian and military persons who conspire to assassinate Hitler and place a new government in power before any of his inner circle can seize control. Obviously this fails. You might think that knowing what happens at the end would spoil it, but actually quite the opposite is the case. Despite knowing the outcome, you still find yourself hoping that their plan will succeed and for maybe five minutes it seems to the audience, and to Stauffenberg, that the impossible has been achieved; the coup d'etat has been successful, Berlin is under resistance leadership, and contingents of SS soldiers are being arrested all over Europe. Sadly, the dream crumbles, everybody is put to death, and the audience eat their popcorn somewhat slower than they did a moment ago (although, who still has popcorn at the end of a film? The human/idiot behind me.) What is truly interesting about Valkyrie are the butterfly-effect instances which interfere with Stauffenberg's plot. For instance, the sunny weather means that the room for Hitler's military conference is moved to a place not as susceptible to a bomb blast. A couple of degrees lower in temperature and he would almost certainly have been killed. Similarly, the hesitant decision by the officer in charge of the station which relayed military orders across Germany to side against Stauffenberg and therefore cut off any communication from his headquarters destroys any chance the resistance have of maintaining control. This may or may not be the worst decision of all time (except for that entirely unrelated one in 1933.) Thankfully, the usually espiègle Cruise plays Stauffenberg as entirely serious, a tortured man who can see how Hitler's actions will cloud the world's judgement of ""unser heiliges Deutschland"" for generations to come. Cruise particularly shines following Stauffenberg's realisation that his plot has failed, as you can see the hope literally draining from his face to be replaced by abject resignation. Bill Nighy as General Olbricht is likewise fantastic, not only because he looks like a zombie, but because he highlights Olbricht's questionable actions during the coup and does not try to paint his character in a sympathetic light, despite his position as a key member of the resistance.<br/><br/>Only a couple of trivial factors detract from Valkyrie. Firstly, why does Albert Speer only receive a one second cameo? ""Because he has nothing to do with the film."" Fine, but the actor playing Speer looked more like him than the actor portraying Göring, and Göring had numerous close-ups in the Berghof scene. Secondly, which is more of a continuation of the first point, why didn't the casting crew cast the sergeant in the relay room, who played Göring in Hitler: the Rise of Evil, as Göring? ""Because you're literally the only person in the world who cares, that's why."" Fine.<br/><br/>Overall, everybody should see Valkyrie because it is an important film that does not shy away from telling the truth about a number of Germans who actively opposed Hitler's totalitarian regime. As some colonel says, ""Every second we stand here is a second lost!"" So...go and see it quickly."

However, Hitler survives and the conspirators are executed.<br/><br/>The 2004 ""Stauffenberg"" with Sebastian Koch in the lead role is another great example of the powerful German cinema. Based on a true event, with remarkable performances, tight direction and excellent reconstitution of a dark period of the contemporary Germany history, it is highly recommended  indeed a must-see film - for fans of war movies. This shallow and unnecessary remake, with Tom Cruise in the lead role and spoken in English, is only recommended for fans of Tom Cruise and viewers that do not like to read subtitles.

I couldn't help but chuckle during the film whenever I saw Tom Cruise on the screen and he reminded me of his role as ""Maverick"" from Top Gun. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Tom Cruise, but like I stated, this role is way beyond his acting ability.<br/><br/>Another annoying thing of this movie is Adolf Hitler. It's really hard to see and hear Hitler speak perfect American English. It would of been a bit more believable if he had a German accent whenever he spoke English. Also, Hitler didn't seem so evil without a German accent.<br/><br/>I rented this movie and after hearing the first few minutes in English, I thought I would be able to switch the audio to the German language, but that option was not even available. As a DVD, it would of been nice to have a German audio option.<br/><br/>If director Bryan Singer wanted to stay true to the real-life, WWII event surrounding ""Operation Valkyrie"", he should of stayed true to the language.

It would have distracted from an otherwise decent acting performance. <br/><br/>As well, going into the movie I expected an action-packed thriller but the pacing made up for lack of prolonged action. It was a nice change of theme to a war movie, as it dealt with the story of the Germans, not the Allies. <br/><br/>The side-roles were extremely well cast. I recognized several great German actors such as Christian Berkel, who gave a great performance as Quirnheim.

","I haven't even finished watching it, and I can tell you from a lifetime of watching great and ugly movies that this is truly a waste of talent. I love history, but I think that most of us have moved beyond Hitler. He didn't win, and has been cast in a most unfavorable light. I would have done much the same as him, except for going after the Jews and attacking Russia. And letting 300,000 captive British soldiers go. And using the Messerschmidt for bombing rather than combat. Hitler was a doomed cadaver, but not without his talents. The people who made this film have a heavy cross to bear. Nazi war memorials in 2009 are akin to black-face and Al Jolson. Some things belong in the past. This narrow view of European history is farcical. I loved Tom Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut and The Last Samurai, but those were both seamless classic movies that move the heart and imagination. This is a piece of turd, truly. Branagh does not save it, nor does Tom running around in an eye patch. Hitler looks like a dwarf. In reality he was 5'11"" to Tom's 5'7"", and yet he is made to look like a diminutive lizard cowering beneath the towering Tom Cruise. It is a joke. And the people who made this terrible movie cannot be excused. This was bad timing. The costumes and historicity are fine, but everything else is bland to typical. Had they even gone the Mel Gibson route and chosen only no-name or no-fame actors to make you believe the roles more readily, this still fails from a filmic point of view let alone an artistic. What makes it worse is that some little zipper-head with a camera filmed it in a movie house and Shylocked my friend for $2.00, The real scam is paying full theater price to see this dustbin of a flick. A waste of time. It belongs under the M3 in exchange for the original Wicker Man footage. Bring back Stanley Kubrick and keep us from movies like this, please."
"dfranzen70","6","3","9","31 December 2008"," Flawed by Cruise performance, but not a terrible thriller
","Tom Cruise's traditional one-note performance prevents this true-life suspense thriller from being anything but a predictable, pointless exercise in hubris. Although most of the accents seem inauthentic anyway, Cruise's dull, toneless American dialect is about as sincere as Kevin Costner's legendary Robin Hood accent, without the sweeping sense of purpose. In the end, the movie is largely forgettable; given the large amount of negative publicity surrounding it and its star, this is faint praise indeed.<br/><br/>Colonel von Stauffenberg (Cruise) is a disillusioned German officer during World War II who decides that he and he alone must thwart the Fuhrer and save Germany from itself. He quickly discovers, though, that he's not exactly alone in that attitude, as various fellow officers (played by such luminaries as Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, and Terence Stamp) have been trying to take Hitler out for some time. All they need is a good plan and a good organizer.<br/><br/>The trouble, Stauffenberg quickly realizes, isn't the assassination itself but rather the aftermath. You can't just kill Hitler and waltz in with a new chancellor, since he does have plenty of supporters. So Staffenberg decides to co-opt an existing plan, called Valkryie, and adopt it for his own purposes. Valkyrie is intended to be the contingency plan should the Allies break through to Berlin, but Stauffenberg (rather easily) rewrites it so that one set of Germans is blamed for the assassination of Der Fuhrer, thus allowing them to be imprisoned by another set of Germans. Quite crafty.<br/><br/>But as any casual student of world affairs in the twentieth century can attest, this isn't how thins panned out. As we all know, Hitler eventually committed suicide in his bunker in 1945, as the war was nearing its conclusion. So obviously the Stauffenberg plan was an abject failure, which sort of removes a lot of suspense. But director Bryan Singer still manages to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, particularly during the explosion that ostensibly kills Hitler (and his cabinet); you know it's coming, but it arrives so suddenly and so organically, without any good-guy slow-motion theatrics, that it's very jarring and effective.<br/><br/>In addition, Singer pays less attention to What This All Means to the world (and Germany in particular) and concentrates instead on the psychological makeup of the conspirators, particularly the reticent General Olbricht (Nighy) and the decisive Stauffenberg. What happens to influence their plan? What happens that they hadn't counted on at all? Most importantly, what happens when the plan ultimately fails? So I have to give Singer a lot of credit here, building up some suspense when the outcome is already knowable to everyone.<br/><br/>But the overall probably, as usual, is Cruise himself: he's simply not credible in the role of a long-serving German military officer. Cruise always seems to feel that since he's such a Great Actor, he can simply slap on some accessory - in this case, an eyepatch - and he's immediately transformed into that character. Not the same guy, Stauffenberg and Cruise! Not the same guy at all! The fact is, though, that the eyepatch has more personality; Cruise is neither serious enough nor solid enough in the role for you to believe he's anything other than Tom Cruise, Movie Guy. He even rolls through his standard two or three expressions, and when that's done, he's done.<br/><br/>Cast with another Stauffenberg, Valkryie might have soared a bit higher, but Cruise's flawed performance is more reminiscent of an albatross than an eagle."

The film is beautifully shot and flows very well. My two issues with the film are the difficulty in believing this small group of outcasts could pull this off, and the site of Tom Cruise in nearly every scene.<br/><br/>Hard to imagine this film gathering much of a following given the star and the subject matter plus the fact that it is only enjoyable to watch from a technical aspect.

And possibly another time in a scene where he was carrying a weapon. Since when did German officers carry what looked to me to be Barettas? Everybody knows that the standard officer sidearm was a Luger. There was no mention of the role that Field Marshall Irwin Rommel played in the assassination attempt. It was an important part of history as I recall, and he did commit suicide after the attempt failure.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I liked the movie a good deal, and consider it a must see, especially for WW II history buffs.

","I suppose there's not much point in adding yet another voice to the hundreds that have come before, but I just wanted to get my opinion off my chest.<br/><br/>I admit I was expecting the worst from this movie, yet a pleasant surprise would have been welcome. First of all, who is who here? How do you account for a load of British accents, practically the lone American accent (Tom's) and a smattering of German accents? Were those German accents supposed to depict ultra-German Germans? I found that phenomenon extremely confusing and distracting. Next, could not the drama of the events have spoken for itself? Did we have to have a constantly sinister soundtrack to remind us that something serious was afoot? I also found that extremely annoying. Third, I did not feel that Tom Cruise delivering his lines in a sonorous whisper substituted for real depth of feeling and acting ability. Fourth, did they HAVE to give Nina von Stauffenberg the Hollywood-glam treatment? Look at pictures of her. She was not drop-dead gorgeous, or impeccably costumed, nor did she have elegantly flowing locks.<br/><br/>Fifth, I have to take issue with the premise of the movie. ""Many saw evil. They dared to stop it."" Yes, they dared to stop it, or try, more than 11 years after it began, with most of them as registered members of the Nazi Party. I don't deny that resistance was extremely difficult and dangerous in Nazi Germany, but we have to remember that the majority of Germans, including Claus von Stauffenberg, allowed it to become Nazi Germany in the first place. And by mid-1944, some were resisting so strongly in order to save face, as it was clear that Germany would lose the war. Where was the serious resistance when the Jews lost their civil rights? When Jewish businesses and synagogues across the country were destroyed, and Jews themselves terrorized, BEFORE the war, in November 1938? When Hitler invaded country after country, before and after the war's start? Thank God for people like Claus von Stauffenberg, Ulrich von Hassell and others. But it was far too little, far too late. And Valkyrie, including Tom Cruise's attempt at a noble portrayal of Von Stauffenberg, does absolutely nothing to acknowledge that. Von Stauffenberg's last words, ""Long live sacred Germany!"" (""Es lebe das heilige Deutschland,"" I assume), show part of the underlying problem. Too many Germans believed that Germany was somehow sacred, and therefore entitled to more, while subject to less moral judgment. How wrong they were, and what a price they paid. And what a price did pay all those murdered by the Nazi regime. A glamorized, would-be valiant ""Valkyrie"" can't change that.<br/><br/>Rant over."

Branagh, Stamp, Wilkinson, Nighy and even Eddie Izzard are flawless in their depictions as Nazi soldiers who are disgusted by their leader. Tom Cruise is neither here nor there, playing the leader Claus von Stauffenberg. He is not bad, just not very good either.<br/><br/>With the outcome previously known, I approached ""Valkyrie"" as pure entertainment. It's always good to leave a film a little wiser about history but this film didn't leave me breathless or astonished in any way. The film is suspenseful, well made and written and is most likely a very welcome addition in the genre for WW2 buffs.<br/><br/>In the end, what stayed with me was that it seemed likely that some higher power was watching out for the demented leader of Germany as no less than 15 assassinations were attempted and in the end he died of his own hand. It's a funny twist of fate."

","The 3 days History student is very pleased by this movie and remembers why I have chosen this education at first before taking a Law course: <br/><br/>History makes me become one with the world: my little life becomes nothing in comparison of the thousands, and help me delete my false conceptions for the truth.<br/><br/>I heard about this attack in my class book and without any more data, I imagined that Stauffenberg was an individual but courageous lunatic. I never guessed that the coup was much bigger and there were so much involved in top levels. It's dramatic to see how those men evolved from shyness to dedication to kill the Furher at any cost, because with the end coming, they must have to try anything to avoid their heroism to remain unknown for ever.<br/><br/>Maybe because Third Reich means pure evil, his seduction is heavy and Singer helps it: sets, wardrobe are beautiful all the more this movie was actually shot in Germany. The only flaw is the Fuhrer portraying which lacks of charisma! I have seen Z-movies about WWII with more daunting Fuhrer.<br/><br/>I would finish by wondering why we have to wait so long for such a story? Why my french cinema which considers itself for the best of the world, didn't adapt it so far? And I stick with my ""Iwo Jima"" feeling, that if American movies show that their past adversaries have dignity, I am still waiting for a American war movie saying that they have behave shamefully!"
"MaxBorg89","8","2","5","6 February 2009"," What could have been...
","Nazis are a recurring motif in Bryan Singer's filmography: his third feature, Apt Pupil, dealt with the sick relationship between a teenager and a former SS officer, while the villain in the X-Men franchise, Magneto, is famously driven by his hatred for humanity after his family was wiped out at Auschwitz. Is it that strange, then, that when a project emerged concerning a failed attempt on Adolf Hitler's life in 1944 (all based on real events), Singer faced plenty of obstacles (problems with German authorities, re-shoots, constant changes of the release date) to get it done? The result is perhaps his least accomplished picture to this day, but when he gets it right, he gets it very right.<br/><br/>One thing the movie makes very clear from the beginning is this: not all Germans were on Hitler's side, but usually those who didn't agree with his ideology kept it to themselves. When we first meet Colonel Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), he has already lost all faith in the Nazi dictatorship, and after losing his left eye, right hand and two fingers from the left during a military mission in Africa, he decides it's time to really do something. This leads him to joining forces with a group of disillusioned officers (Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp among them), who appoint him as the new leader of the conspiracy to kill Hitler (David Bamber). The plan they come up with is indeed very clever: using Hitler's own reserve army (the so-called Operation Valkyrie, hence the film's title), they will take over the control of Berlin and subsequently the rest of Germany once the Fuhrer has been blown to pieces. However, there's always a slight chance the operation might fail, and since not everyone at the Ministry of War (Tom Wilkinson's General Fromm, for example) shares their anti-Nazi mentality, they must be prepared to face the consequences, should anything go wrong.<br/><br/>The main strength displayed by Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (the Oscar-winning author of the director's breakthrough feature, The Usual Suspects) is their decision to make the movie a thriller, not a history lesson (apart from the accuracy of the production design and costumes): the narrative moves at a quick pace, the mood is the same as in classics like The Manchurian Candidate and the entire second half of the picture reeks of pure, unadulterated suspense. This is a strength, but also a weakness: the plot structure and Singer's direction have the surprising effect of making the story tremendously exciting despite the obvious outcome (although, as the director commented in an interview, everyone knew how Titanic was going to end, and that didn't stop it from earning an obscene amount of money), but this also leads to most of the characters being depicted as mere pawns in the game. In fact, apart from Stauffenberg, no one is given enough psychological back-story to explain why they're doing what they're doing.<br/><br/>And yet the characters are great fun to watch, and that's all due to Singer's trademark excellent eye for casting: the British group of supporting players (Wilkinson, Nighy, Branagh, Stamp, Tom Hollander and Kenneth Cranham) lend the picture the dramatic gravitas few American actors are able to give a period piece (even comedian Eddie Izzard keeps a straight face throughout proceedings), and Cruise, ostensibly chosen because of the resemblance between him and Stauffenberg, proves to be as solid a lead as ever and confirms, once again , that he's a better actor than most people give him credit for. Part of the actors' success lies also in Singer's vital decision to let everyone speak with their normal accents instead of trying to make them sound German, since he didn't want ""realistic"" to become ""ridiculous"" (and after seeing Mel Brooks' The Producers, it's hard to disagree). In fact, the only non-German cast-member who speaks with the ""correct"" accent is Bamber, a choice that is easily explained: it's another effective way to distance Hitler from his adversaries, since the actor's speech pattern gives the dictator an additional aura of monstrosity.<br/><br/>Valkyrie isn't a perfect film, that's a given, but it isn't as bad as the pre-release reports were keen to imply, either: it is in the hands of a very competent director, and what it lacks in detail it makes up for in pacing, tension and performances. Not bad for a picture a lot of people considered doomed while it was still in production.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","I have only just got around to seeing this movie and I found it brilliant. I have read many threads on here commenting on Tom Cruise and his religion! I'm sorry but the what heck has that got to do with this film? I ask you?!?!? This film delivers from the opening scene and it just doesn't stop. Some films have a start, a middle and an end, where you have three impact parts and little boring bits in the middle to attach them all. But in my opinion not this one! In certain parts of the film (I am not going to describe them, in case some people haven't seen it yet) my heart was in my mouth with fear and nerves and I got goose-pimples (and no the cinema wasn't cold!). That sounds extremely silly but when you put it into context that the storyline was based on actually events its really not that silly.<br/><br/>The last half hour of the film for me, was extremely emotional. My heart went out to the Germans who tried so hard to destroy Hitler and what Kenneth Branagh said in the movie ""show them that not all Germans are the same"". Not only is this a Hollywood movie with excellent actors putting a great performance but this was based on true events and some people need to take a step back and remember this little detail. Perhaps then they would begin to understand and appreciate this film.<br/><br/>In my opinion, go and see this film! You will not be disappointed!"
"TomCruiseFan99","10","2","5","3 February 2009"," Thrilling history lesson
","As a 29-year-old South African, the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler (let alone the other 15 attempts) was news to me. I never knew about it until I first heard of the making of this movie. We were taught World History in school, and the second World War formed part of that, but somehow we must have just glossed over the fact that there were inside-attempts on Hitler's life.<br/><br/>So, eager to learn something about history I never knew, I really looked forward to this movie (that and the fact that I'm a huge Cruise fan). And I have to say I was really impressed. The negative pre-release hype had me very concerned, but it was all in vain. The movie was well made, had very good performances and managed to do the near-impossible: maintain suspense in a movie where the outcome is known in advance. (The outcome obviously being that they don't succeed in killing Hitler. Not a spoiler by the way).<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is basically the set-up. We see Tom get recruited by the dissident officers due to his outspoken and vocal criticism of the way the country is being run into the ground. Once he joins the ""rebels"", his vision in getting rid of Hitler becomes even more focused and determined, which leads him to orchestrate the July 20th plot.<br/><br/>In the second half, Brayn Singer builds an ever-increasing level of suspense and close calls as the plan gets put into motion. And it really is an eye-opening experience to see everything that Operation Valkyrie entailed. With the success of the mission hinging on so many factors, one can only marvel at the intricacy and scope of the plot.<br/><br/>Cruise was very good in the lead role, with just the right amount of self-belief and maybe false optimism to play Von Stauffenberg. Some of the supporting actors though, to be honest, put in even better performances, especially Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson. So leave your skepticism at the door, and give this movie a chance. It's inspiring and tragic, but instills hope in humanity, that only by making a stand can any of us hope to make a difference."

","I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan. I think he has a tendency to play the same characters usually a bit too heroic. And don't get me started on Scientology. However putting all this aside, I actually enjoyed his latest movie. I am interested in history and I know most there is to know about WW II. So I knew about Von Stauffenberg and his attempt to kill Hitler. I also remember seeing a documentary some years ago about the fate of some of those accused of participating in the attempt. A pretty gruesome fate ( they were tortured and hung on meat-hooks after being humilitated by 'judge' Freisler.) This didn't happen to Von Stauffenberg, he was quickly executed along with some accomplices. So we know the attempt failed. Does that mean this is a dull movie? No! Actually you keep kinda hoping for a different ending. I didn't know that the conspirators actually tried to secure Berlin. The movie looks great and authentic. The actors are dependable and Cruise? Cruise is quite good really. He doesn't speak good German so I didn't mind that the movie was spoken English. Some questions do remain....like why had Fromm Von Stauffenberg and some accomplices so quickly executed against Hitler's orders? It cost him his own life eventually. Why did Olbricht wait to declare operation Valkyrie? Nevertheless this is an entertaining lesson in modern history."

","Let's get the criticism out of the way first. Valkyrie thinks it is an important film. It isn't.<br/><br/>It is, however, a more than effective suspense thriller using an actual event from WWII as its plot, whereby Tom Cruise and half the cast of Pirates Of The Caribbean try (and fail) to blow up Hitler. Its effectiveness is all the more remarkable given that the audience knows from the outset that the plot failed.<br/><br/>The level of tension is sustained throughout, and towards the end you find yourself half hoping that it will turn out that the plotters succeed - the suspense is that effective.<br/><br/>The cast of mostly British stalwarts are all excellent, including both the unexpected (Eddie Izzard doing a good turn as a reluctant conspirator) and the blink-and-you'll- miss-'em (Bernard Hill as an officer blown up in the first five minutes). It was very pleasing to see the delectable Carice van Houten in a mainstream movie.<br/><br/>But this is Cruise's movie, and he shows again how well he holds the screen. This is a decent performance - not award winning, but solid.<br/><br/>The movie held my attention throughout and I left feeling solidly entertained."

","A very excellent movie. Much better than one would expect of Hollywood. Thank goodness they did not take the ""U-571"" (200) or ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) approach to history.<br/><br/>In ancient German mythology the Valkyries (Chooser of the Slain) were beautiful female goddesses who before a battle would select those who are to die and then escort the bravest of the slain to Valhalla. Valkyrie means ""Chooser of the Slain"".<br/><br/>There are several ironies in this story. It was Hitler who unknowingly approved of Operation Valkyrie. But Operation Valkyrie did not allow Hitler to maintain control in the event of an uprising. Nor did it allow the generals to seize control from the Nazis. Instead, Operation Valkyrie accomplished what no man foresaw, the destruction of the best and the bravest of the senior German officer corps. The Valkyries would not have had it any other way."

","The surprise of 2008, the critics downplayed this movie. Surprisely the movie is much better than the reviews. The only thing that would of made this movie believable is they needed German accents. Cruise was just too American sounding. The part I liked best about the movie is that it gave the viewer the feeling of what it was like to live in a police state. The better movies are always the ones that follow the events closely. Real life movies are always better than fiction. This movie is a 7 or 8 stars out of 10. Worth seeing in the theater. The actor (Tom Wilkinson) from Emily Rose is in this movie. He plays the German that plays both sides. A lot of British actors in this film. If the plan would of worked, I wonder if the war would have ended sooner."
"RelativeDisposition","6","4","14","30 December 2008"," Would Hitler himself have displayed more emotions portraying von Stauffenberg (than Cruise)?
","I find it ironic that in a movie where there is no such thing as only two dimensions (to the emotional states of the characters), that Tom Cruise finds a way to make this possible. I'm saying that as a person who has generally liked Tom Cruise, and really liked him in a couple of films. I can't remember a movie where I've thought the general acting, and story line was very good, but cared so little for the main character.<br/><br/>The movie follows a good story line; the only thing I really would have liked to see more of was some of the communications that went on behind the scenes towards the end, to add a little more depth from a historical perspective, and to build a little bit more suspense. I also did not have a huge admiration for the Hitler impersonation, as I did not find disgust enough for his character, but came in with low expectations of being impressed with those scenes anyway.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was generally very good, and the characters likable. Even some of the characters who didn't have any lines did a great job of displaying their emotions just from facial expressions alone.<br/><br/>That brings us to the main character who I thought seemed more like Hitler than did Hitler himself in the film. Besides a couple of scenes where the character was obviously distressed, and found in tense situations, I thought Cruise made for a very unlikeable and very two dimensional character. I didn't even realize the lack of emotional ties I had to his character until after the film had ended. Watch some of the behind the scenes footage as well, and see if you get a very unemotional impression of him there as well from how he talks to the other actors on set, like I did. I thought that the von Stauffenberg character was turned into a two dimensional being of almost pure action and decisiveness, when in reality, that poor man must have gone through emotional distress that few of us could even imagine - I felt the movie completely missed out on this very important aspect.<br/><br/>7 stars for the storyline and general acting, but the lack likability for the main character brings it down to 6 stars."

However, who's idea was it to put Tommy in the lead role? He detracts from every scene he's in by his lack of presence. Tommy's insistent actor persona detracts from the importantly historical character he's portraying. Unique in hollywierd, Tommy is never happier when he's playing Tommy enjoying Tommy.

","The movie Valkyrie starring Tom Cruise was; in my opinion, just like the films attempt at Adolf Hitlers assassination, a failure. This films trailers and advertisements portrayed it to be one of the more action packed films of the year, when in reality it was the complete opposite. The only scene containing action or enough suspense to keep you interested is the opening title scene.<br/><br/>If a movie does not contain any true action, comedy, or horror it must contain good acting and direction in order to keep the audiences attention. Valkyrie lacked greatly in each of these departments. For instance, how could a movie about German Officers and Nazis, contain men speaking English; in perfect American and even British accents? This evident and easily avoidable problem was one that caused the movie to lose any sense of realism that it had. Atop the Tom Cruise led nosedive into mediocrity, the director, Bryan Singer should have explained more. There are many times in the movie; when a British sounding ""Nazi"" says one thing and then is contradicted within seconds.<br/><br/>The only thing this film has going for it is a suspenseful soundtrack that can add to the mood of would be suspense. This movie is recommended to be avoided unless a true History or Tom Cruise fan."

","When I heard Tom Cruise was to play a World War II Nazi, I laughed my LMAO off. Tough sell for a non-actor. And by non-actor, I mean movie star. And by movie star, I mean he can't act.<br/><br/>But then it all comes clear. The role was Colonel von Stauffenberg, who was involved in one of the more famous assassination plots against Hitler - so Cruise was not really being asked to extend his acting bone; he was a disenfranchised Nazi, a veritable ""liberal"" in America's eyes. He was a traitor to the Germans, but you know what they say: One man's traitor is another man's Cruise.<br/><br/>And, ludicrous as it may sound, Cruise and director Bryan Singer (X-MEN) actually boast of the ""risk"" for Cruise in taking such a role. What risk? His character is the Hero, with a hatred for the Germans so extreme, he's practically American. <br/><br/>In VALKYRIE, it is 1944 and Chancellor Adolf Hitler, whom many on both sides regard as an ""insane genius,"" is not only losing the war that he started, he is committing atrocities and driving Germany's credibility with the rest of the world straight into the toilet. Kinda like George W. Bush - without the ""genius"" bit. We meet Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (Mr. Cruise, proudly pretending he is ""taking a risk"") as a young rebel, displeased with Hitler's war, his impossible mission, ""to serve Germany - or the Fuehrer - not both.""<br/><br/>Then the Allies bomb him. Stauffenberg loses his right hand, half his left hand, and his left eye. If that doesn't make you wanna blow up your Chancellor, well...<br/><br/>Stauffenberg is recruited by a cast of ""Chermans,"" so upper-crust British they make your butler feel like an illegal Latino: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, Eddie Izzard... It is why VALKYRIE stumbles conceptually, because it is always in the back of our minds, ""No wonder they're trying to assassinate Hitler - they're British!"" <br/><br/>And director Singer ensures that the ""good"" Bad Guys (i.e. traitors) are all British actors and the ""bad"" Bad Guys (i.e. Nazis) are actual German actors.<br/><br/>Then there's Tom. Fruiting about the authentic-looking WWII backdrop, in no way trying to inhabit the role of a one-handed, eye-patched, high-ranking German Chief of Staff. Just Being Cruise. The American accent is bad enough. We get the point of the English-speaking roles for our lazy Western ears, but there is more to a role than an accent; Cruise gives it nothing more than Cruise. We do not lose ourselves in this ""German's"" conflict - committing the highest crimes known to man since Judas Iscariot. It's Tom Cruise, eat your popcorn.<br/><br/>As a political thriller, VALKYRIE succeeds, though. Even with Tom just Being Cruise. Writers Christopher McQuarrie (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) and Nathan Alexander compress events and often just falsify events to keep it popcorn-friendly - this is not a historical document - but they do not lose too much in their streamlining because the story itself is just so entertaining.<br/><br/>""Valkyrie"" was the code-name for a plan that called for Germany's Home Army (led by Thomas Kretschmann - he was the Euro boat captain in KONG 2005) to hold major German cities in case of a revolt from the millions of foreign laborers. Stauffenberg says, ""I've rewritten Valkyrie"" (which is ironic, considering the filmmakers re-wrote the events of Hitler's assassination in VALKYRIE as well) - an idea which comes to Stauffenberg while listening to Wagner's Flight of the Valkyries (somehow Singer squeezed it in.) The plan: to kill Hitler - with a good old-fashioned time-bomb (with no Roger Ebert Red Digital Readout!) - then report that SS radicals were trying to take over the cities, which would allow the conspirators to mobilize the Home Army to arrest all SS officials. This would nullify Hitler's main Gestapo bulldog, Himmler.<br/><br/>Stauffenberg plants the bomb in a briefcase near Hitler during a staff meeting. It detonates, seemingly killing everyone in the room. The Home Army started its takeover of major cities, but just as Germany was about to become the United States of Tom Cruise - Hitler was discovered alive and made a public radio announcement to proclaim his survival was divine.<br/><br/>The conspirators failed by not controlling the flow of information. This was in a time when mass communications were in the form of telegrams sent to a central communications switchboard, then forwarded on. Though the conspirators had hundreds of high-ranking officers onboard Valkyrie, they failed to recruit the low-ranking message personnel. The telegram of Hitler's death stunned these indoctrinated Nazis, but the following one about his survival made them smell that rotten something in Denmark (on accounta it's so close to Germany...)<br/><br/>Just as the conspirators were saying, ""I love it when a plan comes together,"" the Home Army is re-claimed by the Nazis. As Stauffenberg's orders go out over the wire to arrest SS officers, orders issue from the Wolf's Lair (Hitler's HQ) to arrest Stauffenberg. The wire operators chose to send on The Fuehrer's orders and ignore Stauffenberg's.<br/><br/>Stauffenberg made no effort to hide his tracks. He was discovered and executed within the 24-hour period when Valkyrie was launched on 20 July 1944. He was executed 21 July 1944.<br/><br/>Somewhere in Germany, there is a monument to Tom Cruise for his brave sacrifice. Or is it in Britain in the amateur actor's museum?..."

","I knew Tom Cruise couldn't fake a foreign accent, like many of his contemporaries: Gary Oldman, Leonardo DiCaprio, even comic Robin Williams, amongst others. Kenneth Brannagh is British and when Europeans speak English they have a similar accent to a German speaking English, so that's passable.<br/><br/>I despise films where an American actor cannot do a foreign accent, because so many can. I recall John Wayne, portraying a German sea captain in 'The Sea Chase,' and he sounds like John Wayne in 'Hondo' or any other film he made. He had a typical monotone way of speaking and was one of the worst actors in the history of Hollywood.<br/><br/>I like Tom Cruise, particularly in 'Eyes Wide Shut.' As far as 'Valkyrie' is concerned, I'm taking time out to write a review and then I'll continue with the film (which is on pause), but I won't change my '3' rating because it is b-a-a-a-a-d. Lastly, Valkyrie is the wrong spelling. Auf Deutsch, it is spelled 'Walkyrie,' as the 'W' is pronounced with a 'V' sound, as anyone who is a fan of Wagner (pronounced 'Vahgnair') would attest to. Incidentally, I love Wagner's music, especially 'The Ride of the Walkyries,' (from the opera 'Die Walkyrie') even though he was Hitler's favorite composer. At least Hitler had good taste in music."
"ShootingShark","6","1","2","28 November 2012"," Tense, Gripping, Well-Acted Thriller Of Plot To Assassinate Hitler
","Claus von Stauffenberg, a Colonel in the German army in World War II, is disillusioned with the conflict and the Nazi regime. He joins a circle of influential military leaders who have conceived an intricate plot to stage a coup by blowing up the Reichskanzler ...<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this well made thriller and was surprised at the extent to which it is historically accurate (Cruise even looks very similar to Stauffenberg). Like most people I expect, I knew of the bomb plot and how close it came to succeeding (from The Desert Fox), but I was unaware of the details of the post-assassination overthrow of the SS and the whole concept of Operation Walküre. Where the movie really scores for me is in the depiction of the planning for the coup, the misinformation snafu in the immediate aftermath of the explosion and the subsequent gradual collapse of the plot over the course of some hours as the initial support for the conspirators gradually withers away. As with Day Of The Jackal, we know in advance that the mission does not succeed, and thus the suspense comes from the way in which the story reaches its conclusion, which Singer carefully constructs in great detail without ever losing the drama and desperation of the situation. This is done through gripping little vignettes, such as the scenes in the Central Communication Office where the head official (a niftily nervous performance by Webb) receives contradictory telex messages and has to decide which to circulate, or the boy-who-cried-wolf mobilisation of the Reserve Army, as well as standard dramatic pathos. It's such an incredible story that you assume it's made up, but even the more outrageous moments - such as when Stauffenberg immediately confesses his seditious tendencies to his new adjutant - actually happened. The movie also wisely avoids overt moralising; it does reflect on what motivated the resistance but paints them realistically; experienced military and political men who know the war is unwinnable and their Führer's ideology is the raving of a madman. Cruise is excellent in the lead, with strong support from a mostly British cast, and the visuals are first-rate throughout. In several ways this a dour and unexciting movie - it's very talky, there's no humour and it ends in tragedy for the heroes. But by simply being honest to the story its telling, it's both a fascinating moral dilemma and a sobering history lesson. A fine grown-up war film."
"tommcw","5","1","2","21 September 2010"," Decent film, but does not do history justice
","I might have enjoyed this film more if I hadn't previously read about the true history of the July 20, 1944 plot. The actual history of the plot is so compelling that the deviations from it were unnecessary. Many critics, such as Ebert, who give this film such great reviews seem to be commenting, not on the film, but on the history of the event itself, much of which was outside the scope of this two-hour movie. There were also some missed opportunities for major dramatic points, such as when Hitler himself comes on the phone to speak to Maj. Remer. This was the turning point in the plot and really should have been a major crisis point in the film, but it was glossed over. Up to that point the viewer is not certain of whether Hitler is alive or dead. Even those who know the historical outcome could still be held in a compelling suspense at the point when this fact is revealed. Showing Hitler's face during that conversation might have set this point home. As a viewer I was not made to recognize Hitler's voice over the phone, so I was relying on the faith of a minor character that the Fuehrer was, in fact, alive. Instead Hitler is never shown on screen for the remainder of the film. It might also have made a good dramatic point to make it clear that the movement of Staffenberg's briefcase to the far side of the table leg may have been Hitler's salvation. I am under the impression that the table at the Wolf's Lair was held up by sturdy oak supports or socles rather than the fairly flimsy supports shown in the film. <br/><br/>When I saw the trailers I had serious doubts about the choice of Cruise for the part of Col. Staffenberg. Let me say that I think of Cruise as a good actor and think that he often MAKES the films he stars in (imagine Risky Business or Top Gun without him). This said, although his performance was good, I can't say that he pulled off the stoic nature of a German officer that he was obviously trying for. His characteristic half-smile often came off as arrogant. Although in many movies with foreign settings, the use of accents indicating the nationalities of the characters gets a bit tedious, the differing accents did bother me. It sometimes seemed to me like Cruise was an American in the middle of an English plot to kill the German Fuehrer. On the up-side Bill Nighy did a standout performance as the spineless Gen. Olbrecht. Overall, the film did a good job at showing the vacillating character of nearly all the conspirators, which is what really brought the plot down. <br/><br/>The plot of July 20, 1944 is such a compelling subject that I'm sure Hollywood could do better. I hope that, at some point in the future, someone takes it on with an eye to the history of the event rather than the star power of the lead actor and does it justice."

Since I'm an historical noob, I must admit I never heard of this episode of the war, so for ""educational purposes"" I found the movie interesting. But the rest of the movie wasn't bad, but there were too many characters and too many locations involved. Because of the many characters and many locations you never get any affectionous feelings for any of the characters (positive or negative).<br/><br/>It surely will be historical accurate, it isn't an ""re-write by Hollywood"" like U-571 - liked it way more then Valkyrie -, but the way it's told (or shown actually) is like a chapter in a history book and it's like chapters like these what have made me an historical noob ;).<br/><br/>As i summarize it; Not bad (not good either), but only historical interesting."

","Period drama is hard enough (you get things like cobblestones on a parade ground being decidedly modern, in a film set in the Forties - a fact MISSED in the ""goofs"" section for THIS film).<br/><br/>And when the end result is known (like, ""Titanic"" SINKS) it is even harder.<br/><br/>But when it is set in a foreign country, it is IMPOSSIBLE.<br/><br/>One is reminded of Disney's 1960 cartoon of ""101 Dalmations"" - where everyone spoke with English accents, but the puppies all had American ones.<br/><br/>And in the British TV series ""Van Der Valk"" (set in Holland) everyone just used standard British accents - even when the characters visited Britain. But then, all but the OLDEST Dutch people speak FLUENT English - and German - and French. (I also remember being pleased they showed Britain as it was - an incompetent MESS, compared to the efficiency of the Dutch).<br/><br/>Then there is the British sitcom ""Allo, Allo"" where the French, German and British characters all spoke English - but with different accents. Great fun was had when they couldn't understand each other, since they were theoretically speaking different LANGUAGES! (Okay, you had to BE there - but WE laughed).<br/><br/>However, this was not a comedy - thus attention should have been PAID to this issue. This reporter found it DISTRACTING that most of the cast spoke with English accents (they were English ACTORS) while the main stars used American ones.<br/><br/>At times, Tom APPEARED to be trying to ape his English supporting cast - but the results were variable, to say the least.<br/><br/>And of course, Hitler HAD to speak with a German accent, or he wouldn't have been Hitler.<br/><br/>One cannot easily see how this problem could have been solved, short of having everyone speak German with subtitles throughout (yeah - audiences would have LOVED that) or having everyone re-voiced by actors capable of speaking English with German accents (and Tom's fans would not have stood for THAT).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, given the above problems, this was still a valiant effort at portraying a facet of WW2 that many are not aware of. In the early days, it is easy to see how the German people were swept along by the Nazi's promises. But when the full horror had been played out, there were many who realised the voyage begun was now a cruel folly and were eager to STOP it.<br/><br/>Although one had HEARD of the assassination attempts - and vaguely recalled the name Von Stauffenberg - this writer found this semi-documentary of the events fascinating.<br/><br/>And Cruise's performance wasn't bad either."

Needless to say, things don't run entirely to plan.<br/><br/>Big name star Cruise is here sharing a platform with a host of British thespians including Branagh, Nighy, Wilkinson, Terence Stamp and Eddie Izzard, all curiously keeping their English accents despite playing soldiers in the German High Command. The human angle of the story seems to be trying to show how some members of the Nazi Party, even those high up in the chain of command, found some of Hitler's acts unacceptable and wanted to show the world they weren't all compassionless freaks. That's just a sideline, though, and the main angle is the thriller aspect, and this is executed with enough tension, suspense, style and flair to keep things running nicely. No one's delivering the performances of their career, but the all star cast list are a lively sort and keep things flowing along nicely enough.<br/><br/>Interesting, exciting, thrilling and competent, it's not quite good enough to win any awards but it's top notch Sunday night entertainment all the same. ***"
"JoeytheBrit","Null","1","2","6 August 2009"," Suspenseful Account of an Attempt on Hitler's Life
","I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise – although I can understand why he's a movie star – but he's actually quite good here. He plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the German soldier who led the most famous plot to kill Hitler in the last months of WWII. It's a story that, while perhaps not well known in terms of detail, is familiar enough for everyone watching to know that the mission failed, so despite a rather dull opening third, the film does well to generate some suspense once the plan is actually set in motion.<br/><br/>There's no doubting the fact that not all Germans serving in the German army during the war were Nazis, but the quality of noble righteousness with which the character of von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators are painted tends to rankle a little. Had they attempted to kill their fuehrer in the late 30s, when Hitler began his policy of invading neighbouring countries for liebensraum (living room) for the German people, or even in the early years of the 40s when victory in the war looked like a real possibility, I might be more inclined to believe these men were working for a noble cause. Since the attempt on Hitler's life took place in the summer of 1944, when most strategists were already agreed that it was only a question of when – not if – Germany capitulated, I can't help wondering whether self-preservation wasn't more of a factor when it came to going through with the plot.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film itself is a lot better than people believed it would be when the release date kept being put back. There was speculation that the reason was Cruise's German accent, but he – like all the other characters – doesn't even attempt one. That doesn't really bother me – I understand the reasons (and nobody ever complains that Gladiator wasn't in Latin). The film is filled with familiar British character actors, all of whom deliver believable performances (Bill Nighy as the vacillating General Olbricht in especially good.) Even Eddie Izzard turns up (without his frock) in a small role. I also liked the portrayal of Hitler by David Bamber. No bombastic tyrant, very little ranting, just a slight, ageing man with stooped shoulders and a slightly distracted air about him at times who seems to sense that things are slipping from his grasp."

","In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that after the bombing in the beginning of this movie, I fell asleep during the talky sequences during much of the first hour. That said, when the plans of the title went into action, I was riveted for the most part. Tom Cruise is fine as the attempted heroic von Stauffenberg character despite what that real-life person suffered in his attempt at killing Adolf Hitler. And Bryan Singer does provide some suspenseful moments during the last hour. And while I did miss some of Carice van Houten's scenes as Cruise's wife, what I did see were some beautiful frames of her kissing her husband goodbye.

Unfortunately, they picked Tom Cruise - and he's most likely not going anywhere, folks.<br/><br/>Even more unfortunate, they did all this to Valkyrie. This film doesn't aim at ANY in depth Freudian psycho-babble because it shouldn't. In fact, in case you didn't know, it is a WAR film.

It is such a powerful performance by Mr. Cruise, and the supporting cast was simply incredible too, that I just can't see why anyone would want to butcher it by going completely off topic.

The scenery, uniforms, technology were faithfully exact and the sheer audacity of the whole plot was rendered in a true and believable manner. What do the 1 stars want? A stifled PBS document with a suitably dull narrator? I give Cruise and his cast a loud cheer to bring this moment of valor of the Germans to the large screen.

Apart from Cruise, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson are also first rate. Eddie Izzard is especially good in a pivotal role and is almost unrecognizable.<br/><br/>The director, Bryan Singer is a master at creating tension at the right moments, causing the mystery to be not that easy to figure out as might expected.

The conspirators are shown as guys who were horrified at what Hitler was doing, which is bunk. Most of them had no problem with the war when Germany was winning. It's when Germany started losing they started growing a backbone. Von Stauffenburg was no exception.<br/><br/>Now, all that said, the pacing is pretty good. Even being fairly familiar with the story, the pacing and suspense kept me going. They did a good job creating this world (for instance, how much hinged on vintage 1940's style communications).<br/><br/>the Supporting characters were quite good. even the actor who played Hitler avoided ranting cliché that most movies portrayed him as and showed him as somewhat charismatic with a politician's gift."

"HelloTexas11","7","1","2","21 May 2009"," compelling film about plot to kill Hitler
","'Valkyrie' made me think of 'Apollo 13' in the sense that both are about true stories most people have heard about but whose details remained obscure, and thus make the stories worth telling, even though the endings are never in doubt. In the case of 'Valkyrie,' Tom Cruise and a supporting cast largely made up of British actors take us through the fascinating tale of the last documented attempt to kill Adolf Hitler (there were fifteen altogether), and the intricate plan to seize the German government, disable the dreaded SS, and negotiate an end to World War II. Unless one is a student of the war, chances are you've only heard a fragment or two of the whole story; many might think a German officer placed a briefcase with a bomb in it next to Hitler at a meeting and that was it. But as we find out in 'Valkyrie,' there was much more to the scheme and it came tantalizingly close to succeeding. The only real problem was that Hitler wasn't killed by the blast. Many of Germany's top generals had serious doubts about Hitler's military strategy, particularly toward the end of the war, but there had been resistance movements against Hitler since the late thirties, with a changing roster of conspirators. 'Valkyrie' details the last one, spearheaded by Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg (Cruise). The other major players, mostly generals, varied in their degrees of commitment to the plot. Some were adamant in their hatred of Hitler and demanded he be killed; others wavered back and forth, obviously in fear for their lives and their families if the plot failed and they were discovered. The more insistent ones, like Stauffenberg, pushed the plan forward and at times bullied their more reticent comrades into taking action. This is all presented in a very straightforward fashion. 'Valkyrie' reminds one of nothing so much as a very good WW2/espionage film made at the time. The script is tight and well-drawn, the actors uniformly believable. Cruise himself is somewhat subdued compared to other roles he's played, which is the right approach here. The thing that will strike many viewers as most surprising is how far the scheme got. After the bomb explodes during a meeting where Hitler is present, the conspirators waste no time in rounding up SS officers and phoning German commanders in the field to notify them of Hitler's death and the change in government. For a while, it works and there is surprisingly little resistance to what is in effect a coup. Eventually though, Hitler's voice is heard in a telephone call to Berlin, and that is the end of it. Needless to say, the conspirators are nearly all killed, as well as many others who had nothing to do with the plot. Such was the kind of vengeance practiced in Hitler's Germany."

Tom Cruise's portrayal of Stauffenberg is convincing, and the supporting cast help bring this element of the second world war to the big screen.

Tom Cruise here is a great choice, he portrays Von Stauffenberg very convincingly and we believe him all the time. Tom managed to play deep, with passion and excellent precision. Other great winner is the portrait of Hitler himself, here we see a maniac, a cruel tyrant so closely and so causally that the very fact we see Hitler shocks us. Such a small man could do such horrible crimes! Then, there are other great roles, of Beck, Fromm, Goebbels and others. They all are real, breathing, flesh and blood men and women who really created history in 1944. This is a very good movie and I do recommend it to all who like European history. Maybe, the only weak moment is the slightly dragging tempo at times, but it did not break the whole picture."

I was sorry I couldn't get to it sooner, resigning myself to see in only on my smaller screen. Finally I got to the big screen. The first critique of this movie in this long line of them seemed merely Cruise-bashing to me. Perhaps I would not have gone had I read that first one, except for previous interest in the subject. I'm glad I went. Despite my aversion to the star, I was pleasantly surprised. I forgot that it was Tom Cruise. Rather I felt I was watching Von Stauffenberg. Even knowing the actor and the real person's stature's were different, my suspension of disbelief had a low threshold. The movie seemed almost ""documentarian"". Which I enjoyed. While I'm only rating it a 7, that is for the general public, who may not enjoy the subject matter as much as I. For me it was probably a 9. Not a blockbuster, but these types never seem to be. One serendipity item I did find amusing were the number of actors that were also in a Pirates of the Caribbean movie, including Bill Nighy (Davey Jones). Interestingly enough there is a profile photo of Von Stauffenberg on Wikipedia, showing a strong resemblance to Tom Cruise. You can also see he was taller than Cruise. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_von_Stauffenberg"

This film focused so much on the story and pulled it off so brilliantly. The other great thing about this film was that it put you in the perspective of German soldiers during WW2, and how they were caught in a war machine, war mongering Nazi Germany, and how they hated it just as much as anyone else in the world.

Cruise manages to invest himself devotedly into the role and I think it shows on film and thus I can only describe his performance as admirable for taking on such a controversial and demanding role.<br/><br/>The supporting cast that includes Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Terence Stamp, Kevin McNally and Tom Wilkinson portray their respective roles with the expected perfection that comes from these equally talented English actors. David Bamber who portrays Adolf Hitler himself is also very impressive who despite minimal screen time manages to be as eerily creepy and intimidating as the real Hitler himself.<br/><br/>The fact that the majority of the actors in this film do not use German accents never sparked a problem with me, for I would rather listen to them speak normally than feign a horrible attempt at a German accent.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer directs this film and manages successfully to make this story as interesting and thrilling as it could ever be on the big screen, the film is also wonderfully shot under his direction providing the dreary and dark feel of Nazi Germany with ease. Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander have crafted a wonderful script that has translated to screen very well but it is the suspense-driven aspect of it and the tightly-wound performances that hold the film together.<br/><br/>I would recommend the film to anyone seeking a well-shot suspenseful thriller but don't come into the film expecting a completely historically accurate documentary for you will most likely leave in disappointment."

Set within Nazi Germany towards the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler continues to drive the greatest genocide in the history of mankind against the world.

Headed by Colonel Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise)these brave individuals hatch a crude plan to rid Germany of its continued spiral toward hell.<br/><br/>While Cruise is distractingly familiar at certain points in the movie, he delivers a solid performance. Director Bryan Singer has allowed Cruise to rely upon his strengths while others within the action are what feed the emotion. Bill Nighy (Olbricht) and Tom Wilkinson (Fromm) are excellent and help alleviate some of the films massive weight upon Cruise who seems to dominate every frame. The historical landmarks are impressive and the distance shots of the scenery help validate the movie.<br/><br/>For a movie whose ending is already known, Valkyrie is surprisingly riveting and entertaining.

"pcernea-1","9","2","7","28 December 2008"," Excellent Movie With One Problem
","Valkyrie is a great film, important because it is the first (to my knowledge) to illustrate an incident in history too remarkable to be forgotten. The film is well-acted with lush cinematography, and it does a good job of building and maintaining suspense throughout. For this I would give it a 10 out of 10. However, it leaves out a crucial part, and, in doing so, it fails to do justice to Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg and the other protagonists.<br/><br/>Namely--and this is a spoiler--there have been various failed coups dealt against Hitler and other dictators, each one more or less successful. But this coup did not merely end with the execution of the rebels by firing squad. Rather, and I quote from a book, Hitler 'sadistically condemned the men responsible to a slow--and deliberately prolonged--death by piano- wire strangulation while hung on meat hooks. As they were about to expire, they were cut down, revived, and then rehung--repeatedly. (The gruesome spectacle was filmed in graphic detail for Hitler's later enjoyment.)' [--_The Intimate Sex Lives of Famous People_ by Irving Wallace et al.]<br/><br/>The movie only hinted at this. In the movie Hitler said he wanted the rebels alive. Some rebels commit suicide instead of going to certain death by uncertain means. Towards the end the film shows the top brass among the rebels hung by piano wire, which was in turn hung on meat hooks. I presume that in real life the people themselves were hung on meat hooks, Mafia-style. (After all, what are Fascist dictators, if not violent thugs who control the government?) I take it that this scene was meant to be symbolic of the torture, but someone who doesn't know the history might not understand this.<br/><br/>Maybe the filmmakers thought that a torture scene would be too much for the audience. Personally, I was dreading the idea of seeing the rebels get tortured to death, and I was relieved when that was glossed over. Unfortunately, real life is sometimes crueler than Hollywood, and the real protagonists actually had to go through the hell of being tortured to death by Hitler. So to remember that, I think, is worth sacrificing the psychological comfort of the viewing audience for a few minutes. It's important to understand that Hitler wasn't just oblivious to the torture being carried out under his regime, he was actually a sadist.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think there should be a director's cut where they make this scene a little more realistic. After all, other films out there do this without becoming unwatchable. If this happens, I will give the altered version 10/10."

"DICK STEEL","9","2","8","14 February 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Valkyrie
","Since it's based on a true event, unless you have your head buried in the sand, you'll know the outcome, or at least the end result, of Operation Valkyrie, an ambitious plan put into the hands of Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) together with his entourage of high ranking officers and political officials in a coup-de-tat to bring down the Fuhrer, disrupt his chain of command, and assume control of Berlin, thanks to quite a contingency strategy that Hitler had. If it had been successful, history would turn out rather different, but we are where we are now. So what makes it still a compelling story to sit through?<br/><br/>The pace at which Bryan Singer puts this film through that's what, at breakneck speed rarely slowing down to take a breather. And that's quite the winning formula actually, keeping things tight and moving with clockwork military precision. For those who may want to take this as a loose reference for research into unsuccessful attempts at Adolf Hitler's life (this one being the last before the Allies came knocking), it compacted in two hours the entire recruitment to execution stage, where treason is the order of the day, not knowing who to trust, and to what degree.<br/><br/>As explained, with any military operation, nothing goes according to plan. Recruiting is a dangerous exercise, because in a regime where everyone swears an oath of loyalty to one person, it perhaps provided the magical formula on defining loyalties, which is strangely curious yet effective. Decisions on who to believe and who to side, especially when facts become muddled and with the lack of information, it left many wondering and questioning their personal beliefs, whether to stick to the status quo, or jump on the bandwagon in the hopes of effecting change, while putting your neck on the chopping block.<br/><br/>Providence too played a huge role in the film, with changing of key locations and the ease with which certain key elements of the plan get arranged and completed. However, any plans which involve large underground group members each having their own say, or if pass the point of no return they waiver and are not resolute in seeing things through, it puts everything up for grabs. Improvisation without hesitation in execution, especially without thorough, objective and robust planning devoid of emotion, becomes an Achilles heel, with wanting to strike fast an overbearing condition in the plan proving to add complexity for everyone. As with the adage of too many cooks spoiling the broth, plans that rely on inch perfect precision execution, given too many variables on the table, are formulas for disaster.<br/><br/>And what's this about the accent you say? Kate Winslet did a German-accented character to perfection in The Reader, and hence the awards she garnered for that. Bryan Singer may have opted for the cast to not need to put on a fake front (given after all quite a method employed to transition from German to common English), and I felt that given the strong performances all round, it was whether to invest the time to instill that kind of discipline to speak with an accent, which may result in only marginal incremental in authenticity, or choose to forgo it since it's not going to drastically affect the narrative. So accent or not, it's a small issue really.<br/><br/>The cast is a mouth watering one, which could also account for the appeal I suppose. Tom Cruise leads the ensemble cast, even if I found his physical defect of the lack of a hand and missing fingers somewhat distracting, because I always tend to stare at it, in wicked anticipation that the sleeve was cut too short, or if the CG guys left a tell-tale mark. And as mentioned, the cast is nothing but spectacular on paper - Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp (who seems to be in almost every supporting role these days), Eddie Izzard, Jamie Parker who played excellently the loyal Lieutenant under Cruise's von Stauffenberg, and with what I deem as cameos by Kenneth Branagh, as well as the grossly underused Carice van Houten who was also in another WWII-set film in Paul Verhoeven's Black Book.<br/><br/>I suppose fans of Downfall would probably be interested to take a look at a key even that took place within Hitler's chain of command, that likely had sowed additional seeds of suspicion to the dictator leading to the final days of WWII. Save for the initial one-sided battle at the African front in the first few minutes of the film, the rest became a battle of the minds and resolve of its participants in a fierce power struggle. Definitely recommended for WWII buffs."
"moilligxela","6","2","8","27 December 2008"," Generally a solid thriller
","This is a decent, but not great, WW 2 film. It works pretty effectively as a thriller/spy movie, at least early on. And it does an effective job of keeping up suspense considering that it is fairly common historical knowledge that the plot against Hitler failed. Where the film mostly succeeds is in setting up a conspiracy and the characters not knowing who to trust initially. After this takes place, the film ceases to be seriously suspenseful because the end is assured. It's hard to truly enjoy a thriller when the suspense is counter balanced by knowing the ending already. So, the only real suspense later in the film can come from who lives and who dies but the characters have fully committed to the assassination plot knowing that if it fails they would be executed."

","I understand, a lot of work has been done on the details, the setting, costumes and props of that movie. Now, attention to all this fine detail is fine and recommendable, but not at the expense of the story.<br/><br/>The actual Stauffenberg (and in fact all of the resistance) is not shown here. There is just no representation of the development of the actual resistance in Germany of that time. If you wanted to treat that accurately, you'd have to look at the broader developments from even before the coup that brought Hitler to power. You'd look at the conspirators of (and at) Kreisau, the White Rose's operations in Germany and parts of the complicated Prussian military.<br/><br/>Presenting the case of Stauffenberg without that context - even with all the attention to detail in the setting - is but shallow and misleading. Is it maybe the very idea of entertainment (and the funny infotainment) that gets in the way of actually dealing with serious questions?!"

","This is certainly a tale worth telling - the 1944 unsuccessful attempt on the life of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler by a group of dissident army officers centring on the aristocratic Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Furthermore the director Bryan Singer has an exciting record with work including the first two X-men movies. And visually it looks good, being made at Germany's Babelberg studios (which I have visited) with much of the action centred on the Nazi Army Ministry (which again I have visited - it is now a Museum of the Resistance to the Nazis).<br/><br/>The film opens well and, after a dullish section, finishes strongly but that ""Valkyrie"" fails is primarily down to the poor casting. There are some fine British actors on show, including Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp (although it's hard to take comedian Eddie Izzard too seriously), but the short scientologist and American Tom Cruise as the tall, cultured German von Stauffenberg does not work at all."

"wolftab-1","7","1","3","21 May 2009"," A Good Film but Not Great, Thanks to Tom Cruise
","Valkyrie, available this week on DVD and Blu-Ray is based on actual events concerning a plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler at the height of WWII by his own officers. Bryan Singer's film is a fast paced suspenseful thriller that feels like a plot from Mission Impossible. The star studded film keeps the action going and even intriguing even for those that know the history of the failed assassination attempt. However, it's not enough to try to kill Hitler but you also have to plan to take over the government and here is where some of the finer scenes of the film take place in the frenetic chase between the conspirators and the loyal Nazi party members eager to stamp out the traitors. The film does a good job of being clear as to why these particular men wanted to overthrow the Nazi regime and restore Germany's tattered reputation in the world.<br/><br/>The main problem for me is the lack of German accents or language in the film. We are basically seeing the whole internal battle of German soldiers/politicians and their Nazi counterparts all played by mostly British and American actors, led by Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Now, a lot of negative feedback has been given about Mr. Cruise's performance and I cannot disagree with a lot of it. He appeared to be a boy surrounded by men and was certainly not the strongest actor of any scene he was in when compared with Kenneth Branaugh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp. OK, he was better than Eddie Izzard, but not by much. He seemed to just be reciting his lines with no connection or feeling behind them and when feeling did come out, it felt forced and rarely could I feel him having clarity about the person he was portraying, who happens to be a German hero. All these fine veteran actors were living out their circumstances meaningfully. I was not impressed by the few lines of German spoken by Mr. Cruise at the opening of the film but then we hear good old English the rest of the way. I mean why bother? There wasn't even any German accents, with the exception of two; David Bamber as Hitler and Thomas Kretschmann as Major Otto van Remer.<br/><br/>Aside, from that, this is a good film that is worth seeing. The writing was crisp and engaging, while Bryan Singer's direction was sure and confident. It's a pity that Tom Cruise could not catapult this film to be great, but then again, that is a rare occurrence."
"Siamois","6","1","3","21 May 2009"," Does not meet expectations but still good
","Being a huge fan of Bryan Singer and Christopher McQuarrie, I was eagerly awaiting for Valkyrie. It also helps that Tom Cruise has starred in few duds.<br/><br/>Valkyrie ends up being a nice historical/thriller/war film but does not meet the expectations I had. Thanks to past experience, you would expect Singer to nail both the tensed, shadowy aspects of the conspiracy (Usual Suspects) and amaze us with the grand scope of World War II (X-Men). He doesn't impress with either. In fact, this looks like it could have been directed by any solid veteran filmmaker, and perhaps with added punch and flair. There are few memorable shots, few memorable scenes.<br/><br/>Christopher McQuarrie does not elevate the story past an interesting chronicling of events. Perhaps this type of story does not suit him as well. It's still gripping but more by the fact it is loosely based on real events. McQuarrie has excelled with creating flawed, somewhat cynical and hopeless characters and making us sympathize with them. This would have been a golden opportunity to highlight the various motivations of those behind the coup, but we don't get much of that. Much of the movie centers around Cruise's characters. Some added scenes between various characters without Cruise would have added to the conspiracy aspect. Likewise, there are very few scenes dealing with his personal life. For instance, his family appear more like a background. Same with the injury, which is brushed over quickly.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is solid and dedicated and the rest of the cast I felt was very good. But there just isn't a script or strong lines here. Interestingly enough, after three Mission: Impossible movies that had very little to do with the TV series, this may be the closest thing Cruise has ever done to Espionnage/secret agent films. Closer in feel to a M:I than any of his movies.<br/><br/>This is far from a bad movie. It is interesting. And the fact it is based on real events make it somewhat inspiring. But it is not the movie itself that inspires. More the thought that men were trying the overwhelming task of taking Germany in a new direction at such a critical time.<br/><br/>Worth seeing once on rental."
"das417","7","1","3","20 May 2009"," An historical drama that demands suspense but is unable to deliver
","Valkyrie is the story of the planned assassination of Adolf Hitler. Based on true events, as the movie reminds us, it the story of a missed chances, divided loyalties, devotion, and sacrifice. Unfortunately, Valkyrie the movie has trouble keeping up with the idea that these were men moved by desperate times to do desperate things in order to make sure their country survived. Part of the problem is that director Bryan Singer is unable to convince the audience to forget the historical ending of the coup leaders before the movie ends and thus Valkyrie is limited as soon as it begins. <br/><br/>Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) is a man who finds himself facing a war not only against the Allies, but also the Furher who he believes will destroy Germany. Every scene implies the sense of dedication Stauffenberg has to his country but also the tension he feels towards Adolf Hitler (David Bamber) and the officers responsible for Germany's defeats. After being wounded in North Africa, losing a hand, eye, and fingers from his one remaining hand, Stauffenberg carries a lasting memory and bitterness as to what Hitler has done not only to Germany but also to him as well as his family. A reunion with his wife Nina (Carice van Houten) and his children remind Stauffenberg what is at stake if Germany loses the war, a reality that seems very close to happening as the Allies move closer to Germany on three sides.<br/><br/>Stauffenberg if recruited by Major General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) and General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) who are Wermarcht officers determined to replace Hitler. It is then that Stauffenberg soon takes over as the head of the operation to kill Hitler and to defeat the SS through an internal coup using an internal defense operation codenamed Valkyrie. If Hitler can be killed, and his circle of loyal officials and generals dealt with, then the war can be ended on honorable terms before Germany is destroyed.<br/><br/>The problem is how to do this and this is where Valkyrie the movie is unable to deliver. Valkyrie is unable to build suspense in the plans to kill Hitler which is of course the core of what the plot is about. This is a major flaw despite otherwise good acting and excellent writing. We learn of the various ways this could go wrong and the various tensions amidst the coup leaders themselves who had different objectives and reasonings to kill Hitler. None of this, however, can support the plot if it lacks suspense which Valkyrie tries to give. Valkyrie spends most of its time showing the dedication of these men to their mission but is unable to make the audience really care. Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance as Stauffenberg but he couldn't carry Valkyrie through. If more was spent perhaps focusing on his internal reasons for supporting the coup, and the fears he had for his family, then perhaps Valkyrie could have been more then what it was.<br/><br/>A disappointing historical movie, Valkyrie does show that there were men who were willing to challenge Hitler even if it was during the years when Germany's defeat was unavoidable. The tragedy is that these few men were not enough to stop him.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Finally, director Bryan Singer has brought us something that is different from his previous comic adaptations.<br/><br/>Entitled Valkyrie, he is putting a true story of the assassination of Adolf Hilter onto the big screen, telling us a World War 2 story not many people would know. Not forgetting that casting Tom Cruise as the leading character Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg boasts a large selling point to the historical thriller.<br/><br/>Together with 2 British veteran Kenneth Branagh and Bill Nighy as Major-General Henning Von Tresckow and General Friedrich Olbricht, the trio forms a team to make us of Operation Valkyrie, a emergency plan activated by Adolf Hilter when a coup takes place. Using the operation as the backdrop of an assassination, the trio are trying to take over Adolf Hilter when assassination is a success, so as to prevent the Germans from suffering under the hands of the Adolf Hilter under his regime, and spared from the punishments of the Allies should the Allies taken over Germany.<br/><br/>In the previous comic adaptations by Singer, his movies features loads of explosion and action, which are the key factors contributing to the box office success. However, Singer skips the explosion and actions in Valkyrie. Keeping them to the minimum, he grab the attention of the audience by keeping the pace of the story tight and not lengthy.<br/><br/>The film begins with Claus (Cruise) severely wounded during an attack in North Africa, leaving him with an blind eye and a broken hand. When he feels unjust on how he was treated by the Nazi party for his efforts in the war, he was recruited by General Friedrich (Nighy) into a plan to assassinate Adolf Hitler. At the same time, both are recruiting more military personnel's who are opposing Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>Knowing that the assassination could lead him to glory if he succeed, dead if it fails, he send his children and his beloved wife Nina (Carice Van Houten from Paul Verhoeven's Black Book) off before he began his assassination.<br/><br/>All of these were kept short and direct, where audience were spared from details overloaded, leading to boredom and loss of concentration on the film. At the same time, details of the coup and the assassination were delivered in a smooth flow. Little explosions and exchange of fire were included in the film, thus sparing the audience from the unnecessary violence.<br/><br/>Most would compare Valkyrie with Zhang Yimou's Hero (2002), where both story shares the same idea: to assassinate a country's leader who brings misery and endless war. As the presentation of the story is concern, Valkyrie provided a detailed historical facts where one can expect the assassination to be a failure. Hero, on the other hand, focuses on a fiction tale on the assassination of Emperor Qin Shihuang, China's first emperor.<br/><br/>While Zhang Yimou presents the assassination of the Emperor in a much exaggerated sword fighting scenes, glittered with colorful and artistic visuals, the 90 minutes drama it has lose some audience who are seriously into a good story of a failed assassination. Valkyrie presents to us in a very direct, no frills presentation where human emotions and conflicts will keep your fingers crossed at all times. Even though one will expect Operation Valkyrie to be a failure, Singer spares us the pain that some would go thru in Hero.<br/><br/>Cruise's role as Colonel Stauffenberg is a deja vu of his partner Carice Van Houten's previous role in Black Book. While both roles shares the same goal, Cruise seems to have failed to catch the emotions on his revenge for the country making him a handicap. More rather, his aggressive behavior makes him feel more like a general wanting to hold the dictatorship to rule a country.<br/><br/>One will be disappointed if you want more of Houten's appearance after her remarkable performances in Black Book. Here, being the only leading female character, her appearance and lines were kept minimal. Kenneth Branagh and Bill Nighy, on the other hand, gains more exposure to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Operation Valkyrie might have failed, but it will definitely be something that people will remember, as a coup that overthrows Adolf Hitler, and a historical thriller that display's Singer's talent in his resume."

I knew there were murder plots against Adolf Hitler during WW II, but I did not know that there were large conspiracies against the evil dictator and that there was an attempted coup after Von Stauffenberg's (Tom Cruise) attempt to kill the Nazi leader. This is a good movie and like with ""All The President's Men"" and ""Apollo 13"", knowing the result of the action before seeing it did not diminish my enjoyment. Cruise and cast do not employ German accents (a few actors like Tom Wilkinson sport British accents) but they are believable as WW II era German officers. The best thing about this fine picture occurs after the bomb attempt when Von Stauffenberg and his colleagues attempt to pull off a coup and topple the Nazi regime before it destroys all of Germany. I give this movie a grade of ""A-"" and a strong recommendation."

","Whatever one's opinion is of Tom Cruise, this movie isn't to be missed. Valkyrie blends the brilliant true story of the July 20th Plot and an extremely tense atmosphere for for a great group of final scenes. Theoretically, there might be a small love story between Stauffenburg (Cruise) and his wife, but this is almost completely ignorable. In fact, Cruise isn't where the emotion of this movie comes from. His portrayal of Colonol Stauffenburg is one dimensional: entirely focused on killing Hitler. That being said, Cruise doesn't get in the way of the movie. It is the rest of the cast, which is mainly English, that shines. Bill Nighy's portrayal of Freidrich Olbricht is brilliant, combining cold calculation and quivering indecisiveness. One probably knows how this will end, considering Hitler wasn't assassinated, so the ending shouldn't come as a shock. All of the plotters end up dead: Cruise, Nighy, Parker, and Berkel all are executed via firing squad. It is this final scene where the movie reaches it true potential, watching their reactions to their imminent death is truly emotional. While the first 60-70 minutes are rather boring, once the explosives have gone off the movie is a tense and pulse-pounding must see film. In review: ignore Cruise and watch Nighy."

Stauffenberg's political and ideological conceptions would fit badly into an epic about a hero, and are therefore excluded.<br/><br/>""In an article for the Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, historian Richard J. Evans, a specialist on the Third Reich, described the convictions of the Hitler assassin as follows: ""Stauffenberg's moral outlook was a multi-layered assortment of Catholic teachings, an aristocratic code of ethics, the ethos of old Greece and German romantic poetry."" Under the influence of the poet Stefan George, Stauffenberg aspired to ""an idealized medieval empire"" through which ""Europe, under the leadership of Germany, would acquire a new measure of culture and civilization."" ""These conceptions were compatible with the goals of the Nazis. Although Stauffenberg never joined Hitler's party, whose plebeian character contradicted his own elitist proclivities, he supported Hitler in the 1932 elections for Reich president and celebrated his appointment as Reich chancellor in 1933. He saw in the Nazis a ""movement of national renewal that would put an end to the shabby parliamentary compromises of Weimar.""

How many accents have we heard Meryl Streep portray over the course of her career. Nearly every film that bears her name portrays new characters with new accents and even new body languages... the sign of a TRUE actor. Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Heath Ledger are included amongst the elite of the acting community... not through self proclamation, but through REAL talent.<br/><br/>The fact that Tom chose to pull a ""Keanu Reeves"" and just fake his way through this film... shows that maybe he needs to turn his attention toward sitting out on the sidewalk with the other Scientologist to sell their wares to the unsuspecting tourist of Hollywood Blvd."

The supporting cast though was great. Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson were played role in the success of this movie and they certainly filled in story perfectly. This movie had a lot of potential but it stayed within the realm of mostly a suspense action and drama movie. Valkryie reminded me of a old European movies with its style, location and dialogs.

OK, so Cruise is too enthusiastic about life. Awwwwww, what a horrible trait. Maybe if we can beat him down a little (which is what these comments I read are trying to do) and maybe get him hooked on drugs or arrested you guys might like him more. Pathetic!"

","This is not a WWII action movie, and that's the reason it works. I don't know the history of this story, but knowing how Hitler died historically made me wonder where this was going when the plot seemed to be succeeding. I was thinking, something has to go wrong, or this is not historical. Yet I was surprised to watch it all play out - call the end an anti-climax perhaps? Anyway, it helps to be a history buff watching this: if you put yourself in the shoes of a conspirator-traitor it will mean more. The story is intense, though the action is not so much. I would have liked the writer to have explored the Wagner-Hitler connection more; why name this operation after Wagner's opera? Tom Cruise makes the Colonel character work; probably other actors could have done just as well - no Oscar here. I would have liked a bit more time spent on the motives of Olbricht and Fromm for their actions and inaction. It is fear of ending up on the ""wrong"" side that usually causes these decisions - that should have been further explored. My wife was pleased that the producer at least saw fit to explain what happened to von Stauffenberg's family at the end."

","This is one of the better movies of Tom Cruise. Though the movie has very few surprises especially if you are a history buff, it is still very well done. The superior cast certainly did not disappoint. Though the central theme of the movie is an assassination attempt on Hitler, none of the protagonists in the movie come out as traitors in any angle. Nor do they see themselves as heroes. They were merely acting upon what they felt was right for Germany. This in itself is democracy in action. We get to see both sides, those who support and oppose Hitler, and not just from the view the decision-makers. One of the better scenes is where a lady working in a communications center starts to cry when they receive a message which says that Hitler is dead. Having always viewed Hitler as a tyrant and a monster, this was an interesting take on his popularity. This is a movie worth watching, if not in the theater at least on DVD. Just don't expect too many twists and turns."

Tom Cruise in my opinion was not at his best. Probably one of his worse.<br/><br/>The movie itself I would say, rates as one of the worse movies that I have ever saw.

"wardbeattie","6","1","5","11 January 2009"," A fine effort sunk by Tom Cruise
","On seeing this film, my first reaction was that Tom Cruise's role was enhanced for the film. Last night I read the portion of ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" by William L. Shirer that covers this period, and it looks like his role was not exaggerated much (beyond the ""white knight"" uniform). In fact, the movie goes to great lengths to portray all of the major characters in the story accurately. In fact, I'd almost swear the screenplay was lifted pretty much whole from Shirer's book. (It is a very big book, and is a classic. It was published in 1959, 14 years after the end of the war.)<br/><br/>I'm very interested in this period, so I enjoyed the movie immensely. We forget the past very quickly, and we have mostly forgotten how murderous the Nazis really were. As a result of this coup attempt, the Gestapo tracked down, tried, and executed almost 5,000 Germans, both civilians and military officers. Many of these were middle or upper class (like the characters we see in the film). It's still hard to imagine that this happened in a European state that had a democratically elected government before Hitler took over the state.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I think its main fault was using Tom Cruise for the lead. He just leaves me cold, in every way. Although he is very good looking, I think this must have made him a total narcissist, because he never really seems to connect emotionally with any of his fellow actors -- and there were a whole lot of very good actors in this film. Even the shots where he is kissing his wife don't show his face ... which I suspect looks like a dead fish. For such a good looking guy, he has just zero sex appeal."

","From director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men, Superman Returns), this sounded like an interesting second world war story based on a true story. In Nazi Germany, they were slowly losing the war, and the Germans made quite a few plots to kill Adolf Hitler (David Bamber). This film focuses on one of the closest attempts to kill Hitler masterminded by Colonel Claus Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), with the help of fellow officers. These fellow officers included Major-General Henning Von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy), General Friedrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson), Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp) and General Erich Fellgiebel (Eddie Izzard). The plan was to assassinate the Fuhrer in an explosion, and then initiate Operation Valkyrie, allowing Stauffenberg to seize control of Berlin. Of course Stauffenberg is convinced that the mission was successful and insists the operation is put in action, but of course they must have the Fuhrer's death confirmed. In the end, Stauffenberg and all the fellow officers that assisted in the assassination attempt were punished when Hitler was confirmed as still being alive. Also starring Carice Van Houten as Nina Von Stauffenberg, Thomas Kretschmann as Major Otto Ernst Remer, Kevin R. McNally as Dr. Carl Goerdeler, David Schofield as Erwin Von Witzleben, Tom Hollander as Colonel Heinz Brandt, Ian McNeice as Pompous General and Bernard Hill as Confident General - Desert. The story has its moments that grip you, and the performances are all well done, particularly Cruise who had been getting some harsh press, so it is certainly a war film to try. Worth watching!"
"mattmayakeller","9","0","1","17 February 2020"," A really great movie
","I appreciate a well told true story. I have always liked WWII movies because the Nazi's make such clear cut bad guys. There is not much grey area when it comes to this war about who the bad guys were. The fascinating thing about Valkyrie is that it not only condemns Nazism and fascism but also shows that there were still plenty of good people in Germany who were willing to die for what was right. This movie isn't just entertaining. It has a higher moral message in the end, and that is the difference between a good movie and a great movie. By realistically showing the characters as being human, both the ""good guys"" and the ""bad guys"", I think we are reminded that there was really not anything that special about the German psyche that allowed this to happen. It can happen anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>I think the famous Edmund Burke quote says it best<br/><br/>""The Only Thing Necessary for the Triumph of Evil is that Good Men Do Nothing""<br/><br/>Acting : Great

"Screen_Blitz","7","0","1","11 August 2017"," Although the movie may not leave a powerful impact, it is nonetheless an absorbing account on the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler
","For a brutally profound subject matter such as the attempted assassination of Germany tyrannical leader Adolf Hitler, it takes an immense amount of talent both in front and behind the camera to capture the alarming atmosphere of an event that supposed to be a turning point for Europe during World War II. Bryan Singer, famed from his work in 'Usual Suspects' and the 'X-Men' trilogy, takes a stab at portraying the violent events leading to the failed slaying of the ruthless Nazi leader responsible for the mass execution of over six million Jewish lives. His efforts in some degree do a little justice to the men involved in the notorious plot. By no means does the film carry the powerful gravitas that leaves a powerful impact nor does it strike a chord with a visceral execution. But one of the few things both Singer and the cast on screen manage to accomplish is capture the absorbing tension in a plot that could meant life or death for millions of European lives. This film follows the July 20th 1944 attempted assassination of Third Reich leader Adolf Hitler (played by David Bamber). With Germany accepting the inevitable defeat against the Allied Powers, they believed that the only way war could end peacefully in the European front is eliminating Hitler. Recruited by General Friedrich Fromm (played by Tom Wilkinson), German soldier Colonel Claus Van Stauffenberg (played by Tom Cruise) leads a team of soldiers including Major Henning Von Tresckow (played by Kenneth Branagh) and his compatriot General Friedrich Olbricht (played by Bill Nighy) on a mission to take down the Fuhrer and overthrow the renegade. As the clock is ticking, the soldiers are caught in the crossfires of German officers who grow increasingly suspicious of their dubious intentions. <br/><br/>It is no surprise that the mission was a tragic failure for both sides of the compass as it would be a year later before Hitler finally met his end. While we know how things end, the important aspect is how successfully Bryan Singer crafts the trajectory of the events that lead to the forecoming tragedy. More of a conspiracy thriller than a war film, the film has a fair baggage to offer in the midst of its complex war history. With countless lives in danger of Hitler's tyranny, Singer makes ambitious effort to keep the stakes high and the suspense in the following the diabolical plan against the Third Reich. This accounts to some palpable tension each scene after General Stauffenberg and his colleagues spring into the action. Although the plot is not all firefights and explosions erupting through the air, Singer certainly knows how to keep a decent pace without leaving too many moments feeling wasted. One major flaw lying within the execution is the failure to capture the visceral energy of the action. Along the way, however, the story plants plenty of interesting concepts on the tension between Germany and the Third Reich, enough that will provide you with plenty of food for thought amidst the complicated politics surrounding the war in the European front and the shock waves perpetrated by Hitler's Nazi occupation. As for Tom Cruise, the fine actor does a splendid job capturing the gritty nature of General Stauffenberg, the man fighting the save the future of Germany from Hitler's wrath. While the American actor may not carry any German descent, it is safe to say he fits the bill. He is greatly supported by an English cast of Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, and Kenneth Branagh -- each of whom play characters of different nationalities than their real-life personas. If there is anything missing in their roles, it is the ability for the audiences to grow an emotional attachment to them. <br/><br/>Valkyrie is an intense, tension-driven conspiracy thriller that may capture the heat of its uncompromising subject matter, but sadly falls short of the visceral impact that could have left a lasting impression. Despite this, it is an intriguing picture with a load of thought-provoking material worthy of discussion once the film reaches it conclusion."

","I had seen Valkyrie, the 2008 film by Bryan Singer at the cinema, and I anxiously awaited its DVD release. I was gifted the DVD shortly after release and watched it for a few months straight several times. I added it to my June schedule after realizing I hadn't seen it in nearly 10 years since those months passed just after the DVD release, to see if it held up for me. I was happy to learn that it did, which is not always the case in a film I liked at the time of release after year pass. Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise and Kenneth Branagh in a retelling of the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler and political coup plotted by renegade German Army officers. Historical films are a tough batch if you're historically inclined and know the outcome of what's being filmed, and Valkyrie managed to sustain suspense despite knowing how the plot turned out. <br/><br/>Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) has been severely damaged, like many, by WWII. Losing an eye and an arm in battle, Colonel Stauffenberg along with many others has come to the conclusion that an honorable surrender is the only way out of the war. The problem with the idea of an honorable surrender is the fact that Adolf Hitler would have to be eliminated in order for that to take place. All previous attempts on Hitler's life had failed so Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg has been recruited to head this attempt. In order for this attempt to work, Operation: Valkyrie must be changed to enable the members of the coup to take control of Berlin in the event of Hitler's demise. As the coup members go to work plotting an assassination of Hitler and a military takeover of Berlin, their plan is thwarted by a series of failings and a rout of bad luck.<br/><br/>I remember being in the minority on the issue of the switch to English from German at the beginning of the film, and I was still unbothered by the change in language despite being a fan of foreign cinema. Granted, I'm usually on board for inventive methods of storytelling, but the language shift left me equally as unfazed ten years later. the most fulfilling part for me of waiting so long between viewings was being more familiar with the actors in the film. I had never seen a Kenneth Branagh film before the first time I saw Valkyrie, but I had heard about him a great deal; ten years later, however, I am familiar with Branagh and recognized him immediately in Valkyrie. The same can be said with my experience with Eddie Izzard. I had never even heard his name before my first viewing of Valkyrie, Izzard is well known to me now, and it was a treat to see him in such a role. I'm a classic film fan so I don't often get as much experience with contemporary actors as I probably should so this was a fun exercise in recognition that comes with ten years of cinema maturation. The pacing in Valkyrie was perfect building tension through the end of the film beautifully despite one knowing how the film ends. I was also especially stricken by the lighting of the film. Valkyrie was lit in a way that often evoked a dream-like state while simultaneously providing a ripped-from-the- past historical drama feel, as well. Adding to the tension of the well- paced film was the score, filling the audience with a sense of unease at every turn. Valkyrie is a strong war drama, which well utilizes a unique method of storytelling gripping audiences until the final credits roll; I'm glad the film held up."

As much as we already know how it all ended, we want to see how they tried to do it and the movie is quite skilled at making suspense around it. However, it would have gained value if it established a bridge between the conspiracy and the state of the war, putting the plot in the war context. Personally, I missed that background. Tom Cruise played the lead role in a decent and reasonable way, but without giving personality to his character. He was still sounding like himself. The film also has a good cast of supporting actors, sometimes playing much better than the main actor. Finally, a positive word also for the scenarios and costumes."

The cinematography is amazing and the sets are as accurate as they get, what do you expect Bryan Signer of the X-men directed it. But anyway as all we know basic history is it obvious what was the result of the conspiracy.Man I think that if they had Eric Lenscher (Magneto) with them things would have been different.;)<br/><br/>Now there are some inaccuracies here and there and some thinks that were changed but over all the crew tried to be as authentic as possible and be faithful to the history and the did it. When you adapt a story from a novel ,a comic book, a historical event it is impossible to be 100% accurate, some changes for production sake and keeping the run time in reasonable length, but the most important think is the film present to the audience the main facts and present them as close to reality as that is possible. Here that is a bit easier for the story is focus mainly in Germany and the whole story is started in March 1943 and ended in July 1944. <br/><br/>The last part is crucial for may saved the movie from becoming like Alexander of Oliver Stone or Bayhem Pearl Harbor. It focuses in one story of a bigger period and didn't try to make it as complex as possible but as good as it could be. Just think the most well known and praised WW2 movies, like some my favorites Saving Private Ryan, Letters from Iwo Jima, Das Boot, the Great Escape, the Downfall, the Pianist and Schindler's list. All focused in one in event of character and play the story as it went and showed the way the people reacted. This way is more easy, it helps the audience to relate to the characters and it can then focus to make the settings and costume accurate.<br/><br/>As conspiracies shown in movies go this is one of the best , because it is grounded to reality and simple in order everyone to get the bigger picture. That is how conspiracies are made, not with absurd complicated traps and goal. For real it is impossible 9/11 and similar conspiracies to be true because are so absurd that Willie Cody will come and say :""that's stupid"" !"

Cruise has been successful portraying a variety of different roles and this is a terrific shot at playing a fighter against a dictator of his own country.

In strong supporting roles are Kenneth Branagh, Tom Wilkinson, Terence Stamp, and Bill Nighy who all appear as generals. It is typecasting to the extremes, but also within the best case for it.

"stevehoyland","3","0","1","31 October 2015"," Tom Cruise out of his league?
","As seems normal for American big-budget movies of a historical nature, this must be seen as 'based on fact' rather than factual. The conspirators didn't get anywhere near the control of Berlin and Germany as Is suggested here. Indeed, some of the factual errors are huge - For example, Himmler Is shown not In his all-black SS uniform, but In the field-grey of the Wehrmacht(regular army) which Is a mistake of the highest order. He had no connection with the Wehrmacht In any form. Indeed, despite his presence and plenty of talk regarding the SS, not a single SS man or black SS uniform Is ever seen, especially silly when one considers that Hitlers' personal Bodyguard of two thousand SS men were In close proximity to him at all times. Then we see men In the brown uniforms of the SA (Sturmabteilung), an organisation disbanded In 1934, a full 10 years before the date In which these events are set. Hitler and his confidantes (Keitel, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels)look like comical caricatures rather than representations of the real people. Perhaps this was Intentional, but that makes It all the more puerile. Despite all of this, If you're a war-movie buff or just a person who likes to root for the underdog, then you'll enjoy this movie, Historians and purists will hate It. It's otherwise very well made, although where exactly the $75 Million budget went (other than In the pocket of Mr. Cruise) one can only speculate. The cast - mainly English actors - are superb and Bill Nighy In particular Is excellent as General Olbricht. Why Tom Cruise was chosen for Stauffenberg I simply cannot fathom. He's good at action movies, but this was beyond him and he's put to shame by the excellence of the other cast members. Stauffenberg had aristocratic bearing which Cruise couldn't replicate. Apparently, the whole cast were ordered to refrain from putting on German accents because poor Mr.Cruise couldn't do one, so even the German actors had to speak without an accent! Okay so an accent Isn't really necessary but It adds to the realism. Why didn't they simply get a more suitable man for the part? Tom should stick to what he's best at - this was way beyond him."

","I thought this was a pretty good film. The two flaws to stand out for me would have to be the slow pace of the film, coupled with the portrayal of Hitler by that man, whoever he was. He just didn't to be the man suited to the role, somehow. Hitler, although a villain of the highest order, had his own firm style, solid way of talking etc. Pretty much everyone acted well apart from him I think.<br/><br/>Now, moving away from the film and addressing this whole case, a true event that it was, I have held general dislike for the glorification of the armed forces and the instilling of belief amongst masses that they are supposed to be some kind of heroes, for I refuse to believe such people as heroes who are puppets to their boss in a matter as serious as war - killings etc. - and go on to commit any atrocity that is demanded from their chiefs (nuking two whole cities for example). The mere act of putting on a uniform and going on to kill people cannot make anyone a hero in my view. However, it is people like Colonel Clause that deserve our admiration and such a status, for they go against the trend, against the brainwashing and programming done of their brains, use the human intelligence and reason to differentiate between the right and the wrong.<br/><br/>I understand that an argument can be made against him of after all being part of the same system for so all and the initial years of the war, but you again, the point to be considered is, he did see the light after all and made an attempt before it went completely out of hand. It confirms once more that God makes prevail the right over the wrong one day. At that time an outcast minority condemned to death, their legacy lives on as heroes and Hitler and his cronies are a denounced people."

","This was a totally engrossing political action thriller. We know what's going to happen, yet we remain on the edge of our seats as the events roll forward. This is because we feel like a fly on the wall witnessing a pivotal moment in history. <br/><br/>For the want of a nail the horseshoe was lost...and then the kingdom. The film does a great job conveying that feeling. We get glimpses into the plotter's motivations. No, not everyone is entirely pure and we wonder how come it had taken them so long to arrive at their positions; although, in the case of Colonel Staffenberg it's reasonably well explained.<br/><br/>The acting cast is great and they work together beautifully. No one tries upstage anyone else. The harping about the lack of German accents is plain confounding: Germans don't speak English with German accents; they speak German! I hardly noticed anyone's accent after a short while.<br/><br/>The movie aroused my curiosity about the depicted events and I wanted to see how accurate the film was. I realized that I had as definitive of an account as you can have close at hand: ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", by William Shirer. The film is exceedingly accurate while still adding color and aesthetics.

","Well, to be honest he didn't ruin the movie, but Tom Cruise was horribly cast for this role and he and whoever selected him to have any part (let alone a main part) in this film is responsible for turning a 10 grade movie down to a 5 grade. Casting is everything. He seemed totally misplaced and wrong for the film. It's like choosing Cruise for Schindler's List instead of Liam Neason; he keeps it from being a serious historical movie. Cruise is great in many movies, but he has a strictly modern acting style and personality which is anachronistic in a WWII film like this and is distracting and incongruous. Everyone else (and I mean everyone) was beautifully cast for the film, skillfully selected, and most actors actually closely resembled the real people. Bravo. But Tom Cruise, while somewhat similar in face to the real Claus, just has zero 'command' or 'presence' in the film, especially for a leading role and a high rank of colonel. Plus he is too short, doesn't look German, and combine that with a kid-like face and teenage voice, and you just can't take this guy seriously for this role. And the grandchildren of the real Claus actually openly told Tom Cruise to turn down the role and told him to get out of Germany, because they felt he was a totally wrong selection for the role. To me, the right choice would have been Eric Bana (who did superbly in Munich and who has the height and face which closely resembles Claus) or James Marsden or many others who have more screen presence and who are less kid-like in appearance and voice. A real shame. Otherwise, a wonderfully directly and scripted movie and a cast of actors who are perfect!"

","Yes. Tom Cruise was miscast in this film. The story of the Valkyrie plot against Hitler has been told many times and there's pretty much no derivation from the actual events in this film. The problem arises with the casting of Tom Cruise. He simply did not or could not carry the powerful character of Claus Von Stauffenberg and the entire film suffered from it. Everyone else in the film did a creditable job and thus the film doesn't actually venture into the ""bad"" category, but it's close. I was expecting a powerful performance from Cruise but it just isn't there in this case. Heck, Cruise even bears a slight resemblance to Von Stauffenberg.

","The plot to kill Adolf Hitler put together in July 1944 by a group of military was the last in a series of attempts to kill the head of the Third Reich and save what could be saved of the German honor, and spare Germany the total defeat and unconditional surrender. This is one of the most fascinating and intriguing pages of the history of World War II and any film that is inspired by this action has interesting premises to base upon despite the fact that the end is known to everybody. The plot failed and the was continued for another ten months, Adolf Hitler committed suicide and escaped human justice, but not the justice of history.<br/><br/>The man who led the plot and who had the courage to put a bomb in the meeting room where the commanders of the German army were gathered together with Adolf Hitler is one of the fascinating characters of history. He was a complex character, that his wife Nina von Stauffenberg who survived him for more than half a century described in the following words: He let things come to him, and then he made up his mind ... one of his characteristics was that he really enjoyed playing the devil's advocate. Conservatives were convinced that he was a ferocious Nazi, and ferocious Nazis were convinced he was an unreconstructed conservative. He was neither. <br/><br/>Claus von Stauffenberg is the principal character in Valkyrie, the historic thriller directed by Bryan Singer. Tom Cruise could have been the ideal casting, even if he is about ten years older than the age of 37 that Stauffenberg had at the time of the events. He was not, as both director and lead actor seem to focus on the action side of the story, on the details of the plot that involved activating a program designed by Hitler himself that mobilized the reserve army in the eventuality of a successful plot to the life of the Fuhrer, and on the reasons - mostly of human nature and of hazard - that lead to the failure of the plot. The historic details are interesting, but the documentary quality is not enough to fully sustain a Hollywood production with stars of such quality, and too little of the human dimensions, dilemmas, fears of the plotters make it beyond the screen.<br/><br/>'Valkyrie' could have been a much more interesting film, a drama focused on the tragic complicity of the German military class with the criminal Nazi regime and the choice that few of them made to become traitors to their country in order to save something of the honor of the nation. Instead of that we get a docu-drama made with the expensive means of the Hollywood studios, which bows respectfully to the plotters of July 1944, but fails to bring on screen their human and true historic dimensions."

They should have switched roles. Sometimes a less well-known (or a less crazy) actor should play a lead. That said, I thought Cruise did okay. It was odd to see Eddie Izzard and Bill Nighy in this film-usually they are goof balls or offbeat characters. Seeing them trying to be more straight characters is a weird experience.

"aaron1510","Null","0","4","23 January 2011"," A poorly executed movie.
","Valkyrie is a movie based on the real life story of the ""July 20 plot"", as it is known, a failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944. Headed by Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise), a would be Nazi defector, the plot involved killing Hitler with a concealed bomb. When Hitler died, von Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned to use the reserve German army to restore order to Germany and arrest the S.S. for staging a coup d'Ã©tat, which in actual fact was staged by them. The end result of all this, as they hoped, would be a truce with the Allies. <br/><br/>Sitting down to watch this, I felt very unsure as to whether I would enjoy it. I was conscious of the fact that the movie bases itself around a group of Nazi, and thus German, conspirators, yet most of the actors portraying them are American and English. Indeed, this did serve to take away from the authenticity of the film. I tried to get over it, but the fact of the matter is, when you cast Tom Cruise, who like it or not is an American icon, as your lead Nazi in a movie about Nazis, you're going to find it very difficult to convince your audience that this movie is entirely serious. It just doesn't work. <br/><br/>But even disregarding that, this movie suffers from many issues. It is probably one of the most average movies I have come across in my time, from script, to acting, to directing. There's no flair here. The movie takes forty minutes to get going at all, and when it does, you don't really care. It becomes so concerned with explaining exactly what is happening and what is going to happen in a moment with inanely dumbed-down, plain English that there is zero room left for character development. From when to movie starts to when the movie ends, you learn nothing about von Stauffenberg or who he really was. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise's acting doesn't help this either. He's incredibly unemotional and uninviting as a character, particularly for someone who feels so strongly about over throwing the Nazis. I'd go as far to say he looked uncomfortable in the role. On the day the bombing is to take place, roughly half way through the movie a conspirator, Colonel General Ludwig Beck , declares it ""the most important day of your lives"". Even if it was, it's difficult feel roused or excited, as I felt no real connection to any of these characters, particularly Cruises.<br/><br/>As I was watching, it became more and more obvious to me what was wrong with the film as a whole. It was made as a thriller. That is, it's designed to be fast moving, tense, suspenseful and all of that. Such an interesting story, in my opinion, should not have been ripped apart and dumbed down for Hollywood audiences. Rather, I feel if this story of von Stauffenberg's attempt to kill Hitler was made, firstly with German actors, but also as a drama, with significant character development, and less emphasis on building suspense. It would have been wonderful. The suspense would have come naturally. This film just doesn't do the story justice.<br/><br/>If you want some decent, dramatic, and indeed thrilling films about World War II, stick to The Hurt Locker, Saving Private Ryan, and most importantly Band of Brothers."

Tom is better than usual - he avoids the million dollar smile. He still is a little bit all American but at least he didn't try to fake a German accent - that would have been a disaster.<br/><br/>Kenneth Branagh has been playing a lot of Nazis but I don't think he is very convincing - he doesn't have an evil look. He is more like a milkman or a baker. Other supporting cast members are better.<br/><br/>There was an earlier Brad Davis version which isn't as good as this called the Plot to Kill Hitler if you want to compare."

","In what is a very powerful told story about the German Nazi regime during world war II, Americans get a glimpse into the fact that not all Germans were in support of Hitler's actions. This movie portrays the story of the final attempt on Hitler's life and the events that took place. The men involved were compelled they ""have to show the world that not all of us are like him.""<br/><br/>Most anyone watching the film will know the end of the story, then again who knows with the American education system. But even assuming that you did learn a thing or two about history the story is engaging and does keep you wondering what will happen next. The better question is that it begs what if things happened just slightly different then the events that occur in the film depict. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast do an excellent job in displaying the characters of the film. The sense of tension and urgency comes through from the actors on screen and you are drawn into the feelings that the real life person's must have been feeling in these intense life and death situations. From argumentative discussions to the planting of the bomb to the silent looks and glances the film does an outstanding job of letting the audience feel like they are right there in the scene through out the film.<br/><br/>The re-telling of the famous Stauffenberg is very worth of it's own film and the story is quite interesting.

He is recruited by von Tresckow (a criminally underused Brannagh) to join the staff of fellow German Resistance leader General Olbrecht (Nighy). Stuaffenberg's plan is to kill Hitler and subvert Operation Valkyrie to allow the conspirators to seize power, in effect using Hitler's own plan against him.<br/><br/>After one failed attempt von Stauffenberg successfully detonates a bomb at Hitler's command bunker, the Wolfs-Lair, which he believes has killed Hitler and returns to Berlin to discover that Olbrecht has refused to initial Valkyrie without confirmation that Hitler is dead. As a result the plan is three hours late. Before it is complete communications have been restored to the command bunker and rumours start to circulate that Hitler is alive. From this point on von Stauffenberg's coup is doomed as Hitler is able to personally assures military commanders and the country as a whole that he is alive, exposing Stauffenberg's plot and halting Valkyrie in it's tracks. Soon afterward von Stauffenberg and the other key conspirators are shot by firing squad after a hasty court-martial.<br/><br/>End Spoiler <br/><br/>The (mostly British) cast is absolutely top-notch with great turns by Bill Nighy, Kenneth Brannagh, Tom Wilkinson and even Eddie Izzard (doing well in a non-comic role). Nighy's conflicted, indecisive Olbrecht is stands out particularly but probably only because he has the most screen time after Cruise. Despite thinking that he's about as sane as a Lord Such on mescaline, I have to admit that Cruise can act and here he is excellent as the embittered war hero, determined that treason is the only solution.<br/><br/>If the film has a problem it is that the ending is so inevitable and feels so unnecessary (due to all the conspirators missed opportunities) that I found myself thinking that I'd almost have rather seen the film about what would have happened if the plot had succeeded, or even, dare I say it, Joe Stauffenberg as one man vs. the English Reich."

In fact, I have seen it more than once. So, the story is known and therefore being based on a true story the movie had a lot to prove. <br/><br/>For a few reasons it did not live up to its challenge.<br/><br/>First, while Tom Cruise is a well-known actor, his almost whispering delivery throughout the film made him come off as an actor with a monotone. There was little drama in his acting and it appeared that he was content and the director was content to allowing Mr. Cruise to simply look good in a German uniform and give glaring eye contact throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>Second, with all the detail and expense of dressing almost the entire cast in German uniforms the general lighting scheme of the movie did little to enhance the costuming design. Very dim lit scenes inside rooms and offices was apparent and did not help the visual effect. Even in the era of the 1940s people had better lighting inside their homes and offices. The lighting did not have to have the ""overall orange effect"" with faces in ""half-shadow."" Why Hollywood people think this is a good effect is beyond me. It is boring when seen in the movie theater when the screen is so darkened and it makes one want to fall asleep watching such scenes!<br/><br/>Thirdly, having actors who pronounce their English words with British accents while pretending to be a German is laughable. To make such a film realistic requires (and with all respect to the fine acting staff, however) actors who are real Germans and can speak the English language yet retaining their German pronunciation of English words.

I am asking myself the question if Van Stauffenberg acted only to get power about Germany before it was too late or if he really intended to stop killing more people. 6.5/10."

","If this movie was Spielberg would have had more. Since these strontium on the assumption that a film must be beautiful to be directed by big names like Spielberg, Lucas, Jackson, Cameron. .. All these assessments are wrong you understand the level of bad opinion of this site. Only films for intellectuals can be saved. This film was produced with many dollars and the optimal use of special effects make the place as among the best science fiction film Americans. Finitela of using double standards when judged as a movie, try to be objective because they give 3.8 a film of its kind and reward a crap how terrible sin city with 8.2 is really a 'offense. you are full of prejudices, in some ways this film is more teerminator terminator salvation.

","The age-old Hollywood problem of how to recreate a famous historical event either through realism or accentuation rears its head again in this Bryan Singer-helmed Tom Cruise-starring depiction of the failed von Stauffenburg assassination attempt on Hitler which, if successful could have changed the direction of the Second World War.<br/><br/>A studier of history like myself, while pleased in a way to see the bravery of Von Stauffenburg and his cohorts recognised in film does however think that a more truthful low-key approach would have served this serious subject matter better. However what we get here is a sort of ""Mission Impossible"" for the war era with real life characters reduced to Hollywood-created ciphers and while the film acquires a kinetic energy as it moves towards its doomed conclusion, as stated, the film-maker takes the easy option of giving it the big blockbuster treatment, with over-intrusive soundtrack, various skillful but irrelevant camera tricks and worst of all dialogue which rates alongside ""Braveheart"" and ""Pearl Harbour"" for (lack of) weight and substance.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the production values are top-notch, with excellent sets, costumes and particularly the utilisation of period motor and flying vehicles. However, we again get the wild assortment of accents as none of the heavyweight UK/US cast attempt even the semblance of a German accent throughout the whole movie (even Hitler!) and yet every printed word on display is in the original German. The acting is okay although Cruise is of course just wrong, wrong, wrong in the central part - I was reminded of Cary Grant in ""The Pride and The Passion"" or even Errol Flynn as General Custer and nobody else really rises above playing the uniforms - no-one actor appears at any time to really inhabit their role, which is the least I'd say they owe to the memory of this brave band of conspirators.<br/><br/>The impact (no pun intended) of the crucial bomb scene is again weakened by the crassness of the heightened build-up to the event in time-worn thriller-style and whilst the fall-out scenes which follow as the fortunes of the attempted coup flow and inevitably ebb better draw in the viewer, by then the overall effect has been diminished by what has gone before.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm too precious about matters of authentication but I feel the big-budget action-suspense approach taken here works only with fictional stories and that screen adaptations of actual war-time events benefit immeasurably from a more realistic, documentary-style approach. If you want to see my point in action check out ""Downfall"", a quite brilliant German-language production covering the last days of the Third Reich which manages to harrowingly but engrossingly grip the viewer until the bitter end."

","The story concerning a group of Wehrmacht Officers who in 1943-4 finally decide that 'all is not well with the Fatherland'thanks to Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise might look like Count Stauffenberg,great acting, but I doubt any German Colonel could have been so noble after having been part of their brutal militarism? The depiction of this small group at last wanting to get rid of this madman raised the question,where had they been since 1933 when it all started?<br/><br/>I recall most Germans (after all we know post war it was hard to find any Nazi's) soldiers,civilians,the whole lot of them enjoyed VICTORY- the Condor Legion in Spain,Anschluss,conquering Europe & Russia-always remembering it was only those damned English who spoiled things by not surrendering in 1940. As for those Russian animals,Serbs,Jews etc.-<br/><br/>Well,the Wehrmacht were only good soldiers,just like the U Boat crews who never really liked their job!So the movie shows that finally the proud Prussian spirit rose up & tried to straighten things out- a little late,though I feel this film may not be too popular in Leningrad, Stalingrad,Moscow or Tel Aviv?<br/><br/>With no thanks to the Count & colleagues, Operation Sealion postponed, Dunkirk & the Flying Few saved us & the world from being 'Germanized'<br/><br/>So this good Movie makes me rethink how 'lucky' we were to survive- and how so few Germans ever realized the horror they inflicted & tried finally to do something;sadly in the movie their motivation is not well discussed,other than now WE are suffering?<br/><br/>I suspect if they had succeeded their new autocracy would have still fought to the bitter end? 'D'land uber alles'is still a fine tune?"

","Not bad at all. I've never been a fan of WWII films but recently I've become obsessed with reading about the war as there are so many intriguing things especially as we move chronologically away from it more and more things become declassified such as the occult obsessions of the Third Reich, the NAZI connections to NASA's space race, the development of flying discs by NAZI scientists, the immense funding of the Third Reich by the Bank of England and bankers on Wall Street, the development of IMB's punch-card systems to single out the 'inferior types' (which to this day IBM whinge they had no idea about) and more known things like the influence of Darwinism on National Socialism in the early 20thC, and more specifically the horrific application of the pseudo 'science' of eugenics, a term coined by Darwin's nephew Francis Galton. If I'd have learned all that in school I might have been more interested in history - of course it's not convenient to tell everyone the whole truth so many of us 'allies' are in the dark about the facts that some nutters in Germany were funded, influenced and inspired by the Anglo-American establishment. Then of course if the people of the time had known this it would have vastly damaged morale and the war may have been different... who knows. Anyway Europe was destroyed leading it to be rebuilt into this fabulous integrated trading 'blok' of the E.U. making the road to global governance much easier. - Clearly it's pertinent to add the Nazis and Hitler and Himmler took perfection of the species through negative eugenics to an insane level, quite unlike the eugenics societies of the United States and Europe. Of course hopefully the new global system will be benevolent and will address the enormous issues running amok - such as the corporation, the real Terminator, or golem, or monster which we've created...<br/><br/>All the things which are insubstantially mentioned above are demonstrably documented in various interviews, papers, and books - most notably the works of Anthony Sutton, Edwin Black, Richard Weikart, countless RIIA, CFR, League of Nations, United Nations and other sources writings over the last couple of centuries.<br/><br/>Anyway I digress. It would be nice to have a film about all the really interesting stuff like what I mentioned above but it's never going to happen, I'd have to make it myself - all we have is the conventional vastly boring due to huge omission of vital details history, or the conspiracy psychos. But as a piece of conventional history this does the job fine - it is indeed a compelling story of Herr Stauffenberg and the internal resistance. I read about the event in the book 'Agent Zigzag' - well worth checking out - and so when I saw there was a new film of course I was compelled to check it out. It's quite humorous to observe that half the cast from Pirates of the Caribbean are here - and an appearance from Eddie Izzard is always a nice change from seeing him trannied up telling jokes on stage. I'm always in two minds about Tom Cruise because it doesn't seem like there's ever any real emotion there. It would have been nice to have some consistency in the accents, even if everyone tried to make a subtle attempt at German sounds - but maybe this could have been insulting, I don't know. It would have been nice to have more German actors but as a commercial Hollywood film it's never going to happen is it. They have to ensure popularity and remuneration on the release.<br/><br/>This film is well worth watching for those interested in the history and those who are not. These kinds of films are singularly important to counter the massive propaganda throughout the whole 20th Century demonising the German people as a whole and to clarify that the maniacs who ended up taking control for all those years were not supported by their whole institution - which ultimately was the downfall and internally brought down or rendered ineffective the secret services, the military, civilian and governmental systems from complete adherence to the cause of Germany. And what a relief to everyone who lived to tell the tale.<br/><br/>Other films viewers of this may be interested in and have been referred to by other reviews are 'Der Untergang' (Downfall) and 'Die Welle' (The Wave) - the latter which is a German retelling of a social experiment carried out by a Californian teacher and his class in the sixties (seventies?)."

","For the first time in recent memory, I was overwhelmed with choices when I popped into ""Video Busters"" last night. There was plenty for me, but also a decent range left that wifey might be interested in too. Being a long weekend, I got a stack of videos and for the overnighters grabbed this and ""Revoltionary Road"".<br/><br/>""Valkyrie"" is based upon a remarkable true story of a group of brave men who attempted to assassinate Hitler and seize power of Germany during WW2. That has to rank as one of the gutsiest things to attempt ever. Heading this group is decorated war hero Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (played by Tom Cruise, in his finest work since ""Top Gun""),perhaps the most important Colonel ever behind Colonel Sanders. The plan is reasonably complicated, but if they can pull it off, they will see Hitler and a bunch of his key men killed and a coup occur where the SS will be shutdown and the country can be placed in safe hands and will consequently surrender to the Allies. It won't be easy though. The plan relies on being able to get key army people to be willing to commit treason and to get Hitler to unwittingly sign a document that will essentially enable the coup to occur should he be killed. Tricky. Will The Colonel pull it off? See it to find out.<br/><br/>Reasonably well done, except for the fact everyone spoke English and without a hint of a German accent. That made it seem a bit weird. Cruise was OK at The Colonel, but there would have been about 50 better actors they could have used eg Russell Crowe, Tom Hanks or Sean William Scott. Amazing story and well worth seeing."

","Will these critics PLEASE quit panning Cruise and just take care of the business of OBJECTIVELY reviewing a movie?!! This is a really great film and close to historically correct. I spent several years in Germany and this subject was discussed with some of my German friends and the movie comes as close to history as any while still being entertaining. I am not a Cruise mainstay fan or a Cruise hater, but the fact is its time for these Hollywood stupid types to find another whipping boy! Enough!!! This guy has made a great impact with MOST of his movies, and by and large I have really enjoyed the ones that I have chosen to see. Thanks to IMDb for having this outlet for movie fans to have an outlet for OUR reviews!!!"
"jadegoddess","9","0","3","3 January 2009"," Loved the movie, but the editing bloopers abound!
","Just saw the movie tonight, and actually liked it. I'm not a big Cruise fan, but he made the character likable and you empathized with him and the other officers. My husband and I like history, so this movie was a big attraction for us. But what takes away from the movie, is the fact that you can plainly see the boom mic in many of the scenes. I think someone else on this site refers to it as Operation Boom Mic? I also wonder how this escaped the editing room? Is it because they had to reshoot some of the scenes and were in a time crunch? After a while, it was like a game to me and my husband; whenever one of us spotted the mic, we'd say ""there's another one!"" We counted at least 6. For some, this may be a big distraction and you won't get what you're supposed to get out of this movie, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
