","Rocky IV (1985) is definitely one of the best Sport action films of the 80's! It is my number one favorite best movie in the Rocky series! I love this movie to death and I don't care what anyone says. It was my first film I saw it as a kid, it is my childhood film and I grew up with this movie! Sylvester Stallone did gave us one of his the most best performances of the Rocky character ever! This film along side with Rocky III is very underrated, misunderstood, bashed and dissed off from fans and it's critics! I love this film to death and it has a special place in my heart. The film has everything that I love in a Rocky film. It is fast paced and Entertained from beginning till end.<br/><br/>The film goes very fast, is not boring, dull or lame, it is actually pretty good film, is not bad is actually good. The fourth installment of the Rocky series isn't the greatest film like, were his predecessors but it is still a good film. People: It's not that bad. In fact, it's really good. Okay, it isn't a classic like the first two movies were, and it suffers further by comparison to ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" which came out six months before it. But ""Part IV,"" was still one of the best movies of its year (1985). That fight at the end was EPIC, just amazing. As for the music, Bill Conti is great but so is Vince Dicola! Vince is a genius on synthesizer music. The fight at the end was a literal clash of the titans level bout, and his music fit it so perfectly! Rocky IV remained the highest grossing sports movie for 24 years before it was overtaken by The Blind Side. It is the fourth and most financially successful entry in the Rocky film series.<br/><br/>As a kid Rocky IV was always my favorite best movie. It still is alongside with Rocky I,III and Balboa! It is sad that Apollo dies in this movie I hated that, but the rest was pretty fast entertaining, well faced paced entertained action movie. This is the first movie that place actually took in a different country and not in the US. I love when Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) fly's to Russia to fight the best undefeated champion Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). The training sequences were awesome the fight sequences were entertained and very paced amazing. The soundtracks for this movie were pretty awesome and great. James Brown Living in America was awesome. The fight between Rocky and Drago was set on 25th December Christmas. This is the first Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. The Fourth movie was one of the best Sport action movies Directed by Sylvester Stallone, he made such a great wonderful performance I love You Sly. Without you there wouldn't be Rocky.<br/><br/>I have heard a lot about this film: Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed and Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago really did not get along and got into an a real fight during filming. Lundgren threw Weathers across the ring before it was broken up. You can even see the scene during a press conference regarding the match, hostility is created between Apollo and Drago's respective camps. The fight really went out of hand. Carl Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Sylvester Stallone forced and convince those two macho ego actors to comeback and finishing the film. The major problem with this film I have is killing the most best awesome character Apollo Creed. In Rocky sequel almost everyone dies. The killing one of the most favorite characters was one of the worst idea Stallone ever had. In Rocky III Mickey dies, in Rocky IV Apollo dies in Rocky Balboa Adrian Dies. Stallone kept killing our favorite characters but he memorized them. The movie wasn't filmed in Russia which that really disappointed me and I think Stallone should have visit Russia and film at least one scene there. I love sound effects and Rocky IV is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new special effects. I love everything that it is about this film, everything!<br/><br/>""When east meets west, the champion remains standing"" <br/><br/>Rocky Balboa,heavyweight champion of the world, is the trainer for Apollo Creed in an exhibition match against Ivan Drago, a ""superman"" boxer from the Soviet Union. When Apollo is killed in the ring by the brutal Drago, Balboa blames himself and promises to avenge his friend's death in the ring. That is the basic and simply plot of the most awesome sport action film of the 80's! Rocky IV is a 1985 American sports film written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, who also starred in the film. The film co-stars Dolph Lundgren, Burt Young, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Tony Burton, Brigitte Nielsen, and Michael Pataki. That is the basic plot of the awesome sport action film!<br/><br/>The rating I am giving a 10, I love this film to death, I grew up with it and it is my number1 favorite Rocky Film!"
"baumer","Null","169","212","22 September 1999"," Forget the politics and this is one of the most entertaining films ever made
","In 1976, a phenom was born.  By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later, after three Rocky films, in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles, it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75% of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor, try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match, some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end, just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed, with all due respect to Raging Bull. <br/><br/>
Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films, he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  <br/><br/>Rocky IV is different than Rocky, there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one, it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's ""There's No Easy Way Out""  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video, I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like, I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells "" he's cut, he's cut! ""  the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian, American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.  If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! <br/><br/>
When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.  <br/><br/>"" Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"""
"naughtyjimmy","10","26","30","30 January 2008"," Rocky IV has the most amazing soundtrack ever!
","We all know the plot of Rocky IV is awfully thin (Soviet boxer comes to USA. Soviet boxer kills Rocky's friend. Rocky goes to Soviet Union to avenge aforementioned friend. End of script). And this movie has very little dialog. Granted. This movie is actually a 90-minute music video. Absolutely. And it's full of stereotypes and clichés on the USSR and Russians etc. Logically, this movie is total trash, and by far the worst Rocky movie.<br/><br/>And you know what? Rocky IV is by far my favorite Rocky movie, and one of my all-time fave films. I know this defies all reason, but I'll tell why.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Stallone fan, and once again Sly remarkably directed and acted in this fourth installment of the Rocky saga; the others actors sincerely and convincingly played their parts as well; the editing is impressive too. But the real star of the movie is in fact one you certainly didn't expect. <br/><br/>As I said above, Rocky IV is a one-hour-and-a-half music video, and its real wonder is actually soundtrack author Vince DiCola. As much as I love and respect Bill Conti's work on all other Rocky movies, I must say that in my mind, DiCola's score on this movie surpassed Conti's and is the ""true"", the ""ultimate"" Rocky soundtrack. <br/><br/>DiCola managed to capture the essence of Rocky, i.e. overcoming one's fears, fighting against the odds, perseverance in the face of adversity etc. I'm referring especially to ""Training Montage"" and ""Heart's on Fire"" (wonderfully sung by John Cafferty): more than any other piece of music I've heard in my life, Vince DiCola's tunes are incredibly inspiring, unbelievably motivating... Just listen to them, they'll pump you up like nothing else. Whatever your occupation is (physical or intellectual), they'll instantly put you on a high and in the right mindset to achieve your goal. DiCola's music is so powerful, combined with the impressive editing of the training scenes, I would even be tempted to say it has a near-magical power to motivate you. It's definitely the ultimate inspirational music. <br/><br/>And the score in the rest of the film, especially ""War"" during the final fight, is equally terrific. It makes you root for Rocky from the beginning to the end and feel his emotions.<br/><br/>Stallone often had remarkable soundtracks for his movies (e.g. those by Jerry Goldsmith for the Rambo saga) and it's a shame and incomprehensible that DiCola wrote very few film scores (same for John Cafferty, why isn't he more famous?). I acknowledge that the first time I saw Rocky IV, I hated Vince DiCola's music because it was so different from Bill Conti's, but after watching the movie again, I came to adore it. In 1985, it was a score ahead of its time, and more than twenty years later, it still is. It hasn't lost an ounce of its power. Is it humanly possible to compose a more motivating soundtrack? <br/><br/>Watch (and above all, listen to) Rocky IV from this perspective and you'll understand why there are so many people who love it."
"ccthemovieman-1","8","82","112","24 June 2006"," No Credibility, But Sure Is Entertaining
","Here's another low-brained but very entertaining ""Rocky"" movie with one more interesting villain. Instead Of ""Apollo Creed"" or ""Mr. T.,"" we now have ""Ivan Drago,""(Dolph Lundgren) a giant Russian who is more like a machine. He's ""indestructable"" (and on steroids, too, and unlike some baseball slugger, he admits it!). He has the latest in technology, nutrition, etc., but you just know the much-smaller disadvantaged hero ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) will somehow find a way to chop this ""Goliath"" down.<br/><br/>Minute-for-minute, this might be the most entertaining of all the Rocky films, and looks good on DVD despite some graininess in the first five minutes. Rocky's wife ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire) never looked better: mature and pretty; the gruff and profane manager played Burgess Meredith is gone and the repellent obnoxious slob ""Paulie"" (Burt Young) has only a few lines. <br/><br/>This is the ultimate ""David vs. Goliath"" tale in every aspect and the final bout - held in Russia - breaks the all-time Rocky record for most punches ever thrown at two fighters. Of course, any real-life human would have been knocked cold about 50 times had they suffered the blows ""Rocky"" did in this fight! <br/><br/>This is a real flag-waving film with Rocky draping the Stars and Stripes around his shoulders. It's a totally unrealistic story but, all of these in the series were similar, credibility-wise, so just go along with it and enjoy the story. It's only an hour-and-a-half and story literally flies by."
"Darth_Guybrush","8","37","49","4 November 2006"," Dolph is the highlight
","The sheer effort Dolph (Ivan Drago), Sylvester (Rocky Balboa) and Carl (Apollo Creed) must have gone into training for this film must have been truly awesome. They all look amazingly fit and sculptured. I think more so than any current modern day boxer.<br/><br/>Kudos to Dolph who in almost his first major feature film (his first was View to a Kill) made, at least for me, a major impact. Despite his lack of dialog ""I must break you"" is right up there with Schwarzenegger's ""I'll be back"". He looked amazingly strong - a freak almost - just as the plot intended. Scary. He looked even taller than the 6 inch difference between him and Stallone (Lundgren 6'4"", Stallone 5'10"").<br/><br/>I would think that difference in height/reach would make him nigh on impossible to defeat if this were REAL. Of course it is a movie. Dolph is the highlight and was sad to see Apollo's demise (but at least it shut him up). The writers must have based Apollo's character on Muhammed Ali surely! Am currently watching Rocky V and is interesting so far!"

","I love the rocky films. This is the best. So emotional, also has a great soundtrack. In 1985 they knew how to make good movies"
"gazzo-2","7","52","77","14 January 2000"," Popeye beats Bluto again....
","Oh Man I loved this one when it came out...the death of Apollo Creed, Stallone standing up for Reagan America in his quest to hammer the Evil Empire's steroided up UberMan Drago. You don't for a second actually Believe that Stallone could kayo Lundgren(Dolph is 6-5-220 plus, a kick boxing champ-Sly 5-9ish, 190) but who cares?! It was great to watch them whale away at one another in Russia like that, surrounded by 10,000 Red Guards, a Gorby lookalike and Brigette Neilson there....<br/><br/>Stallone really took to the MTV style of editing in III and does it again here, with the training montages, Survivor/James Brown/Robert Tepper tunes, etc. very well. I personally enjoyed the contrasts-see Stallone chop wood. See Drago pump iron. See Stallone run acrost a snowy field. See Drago run on an Olympic treadmill. See Stallone do crunches while half-suspended from a loft. See Drago bend every concievable advanced weight machine outta shape as he flexes and trains. See Stallone eat his spinach. See Drago take his Steroids....<br/><br/>Basically you know going in, Drago has no chance, the old David vs. Goliath thing all over. And you know when Stallone re-does his run up the Phillie steps thing again, this time up a mountain, losing the KGB in the process, that he is gonna win or die, plain as that.<br/><br/>The fight is as ratcheted up and brutal as they come, really overkill, over-done, I think that Stallone is knocked down something like 8 times, in truth he would have been TKO'd or put into a coma by the 3rd round. And Drago, too, woulda had to suck soup through a straw and filter for 5 weeks himself...Realism isn't the game here, though. Fun is, excitement, getting caught up in the moment, all of it. This film just could not have been made at anytime save the cold War '50s or '80s. Audiences to intuned to the grunge/ironic/'Whatever'/Friends crap of the first half the '90s especially would have laughed this off the screen or gone to bed. Audiences in '85-86...this is what they, WE wanted, and we got, big time....<br/><br/>Things to not worry about in this film, though are debits to the Rocky IV viewing experience--same old, same old performances/roles for Adrian and Paulie. They were brought along for the ride once again, same as Scottie and Bones were for the 19th time in the way too many Trek sequels. And you can't say Brigette got anywheres in Hollywood on her talent, ya know? Just can't see it. Camera loved her, but....<br/><br/>Anyways--as you can tell I ate this one up, and still like it, its my second fave Rocky film.<br/><br/>So, what is the Gazzo-2 rating?<br/><br/>***1/2 outta ****, Cartoony to the max, (Is Not Documentary!)-much fun."
"mmallon4","10","10","12","24 March 2018"," 80's: The Movie
","Rocky IV is one of the most entertaining movies ever made. If there was ever a movie I can turn to for just 90 minutes of pure, immense, adrenaline filled, inspirational entertainment, it's Rocky IV. The runtime is the shortest of the series, but those 90 minutes are perfect. The poster for Rocky IV is displayed proudly in my bedroom, and every now and then I look at it in all its majesty with Rocky sticking his glove up in the air while draped in the stars and stripes. I feel the Rocky movies had the ideal lifespan for a movie franchise; start off serious, goof out for some fun, but then end again on a serious note.<br/><br/>There's no question about it, Rocky IV is the most 80's movie ever. Case in point:
<ul><li>Synthesized rock soundtrack.</li></ul>-Cold war propaganda.
-Conservative, Reagan era values.
-MTV music video style montages.
-Larger than life villain.
-It's a sequel of a long-running franchise.
-There's a robot.
-Rocky drives a sports car.
-Display of decadence.
-Brigitte Nielsen, star of other very 80's movies Red Sonja and Cobra.
-Action movie revenge plot.
-Full of cheesy/corny quotable lines (""If he dies, he dies"", ""Whatever he hits, he destroys"").<br/><br/>Stallone's inspiration for Rocky IV came from the two fights between Joe Louis and Max Schmeling in 1936 and 1938 respectively; two fights which embodied the political and social conflict of the time - an African American taking on a supposed representation of Aryan superiority. Thus in Rocky IV we get Ivan Drago, the terrifying Aryan superman Rocky must challenge to avenge the death of his friend (could that sound more 80's?). Ivan Drago is a terminator; the strongest opponent humanly possible; however is Drago an interesting villain? I say yes; one of my favourite screen villains of all time as a matter of fact. In a memorable Siskel & Ebert moment, Roger Ebert described Drago as a ""moderately interesting villain"" but complained ""how come he never has a single scene alone with his wife"" and ""why does she have nine times more dialogue than he has?"". Drago doesn't speak for himself as there is no individualism in communism. I feel Dolph Lundgren gives a great physical performance, playing a character who is the opposite of Clubber Lang in that he speaks few words; succeeding in being an intimidating monster with his physical presence alone. I also love Drago's reaction to Apollo's entrance at the exhibition fight; that of a Soviet being welcomed to America.<br/><br/>Ivan Drago is a product of a state that sponsors his training as exemplified in the movie's two training montages. Drago's music theme is cold, intimidating and mechanical, just like his training. He is given steroids by his trainers and at a press conference an American reporter says ""There have been rumors of blood doping and widespread distribution of anabolic steroids in the Soviet Union""; feels like an eerie foreshadowing to the state-operated Russian doping scandal of 2016. Following the boycotts at the 1980 and 1984 Olympics, Rocky IV couldn't have come at a better time when sports and politics were going hand in hand. Drago's fit of rage near the end of the fight in which he proclaims ""I fight to win. For me! For me!"", is clearly a jab at communism as he wants to work for himself and not for the glory of the country. Likewise, when he lifts up and throws the Russian official who criticises him, it's a classic Frankenstein moment; the monster turning on its creator.<br/><br/>Apollo Creed's entrance, on the other hand, is one of the most capitalistic things ever put on film, with James Brown singing Living In America among Belly Dancers and Apollo Creed dressed in stars and stripes; and to top it all off, it's in Las Vegas. A stark contrast to the Russians who open the Rocky-Drago fight later in the movie to their national anthem (yet another awe-inspiring musical highlight in the film). Did Apollo's ego untimely kill him? Apollo's patriotic egotism clouded his better judgment and no idea just how strong Drago would be. The sheer power of Drago's punches during the fight with Creed (if you could even call it that) is exemplified by the sound effects. Also, why does Drago receives no punishment for throwing the referee aside, but if I was going to point out every little thing in this movie which makes no sense I'd be here all day. There's such brutality to Creed's death; such slow motion brutality. I'll never forget my mum's reaction the first time I watched Rocky IV, a gasping ""oh my God!"".<br/><br/>When I was studying for my GCSE examinations, the Rocky IV soundtrack was one of my primary sources of music listening. Whenever I have a stressful day of work I listen to the Rocky IV soundtrack when I need that extra bit of adrenaline to make me go on. Feeling down? Rocky IV soundtrack! Need inspiration? Rocky IV soundtrack! Having a workout? Rocky IV soundtrack! 20% of the Rocky IV or 23 minutes is comprised montages with songs which can make anything look epic in one of the epitomes of the 1980's soundtrack; everything you would expect from a score which won the Razzi for worst music score. The score by Vince diCola has been officially released but copies are not easy to come by. The actual Rocky IV soundtrack features different versions of War and Training Montage than those which appear in the film, although these variants are good in their own right.<br/><br/>If there is one word associated with Rocky IV, its montage. I can watch these montages over and over again and still be enthralled by them. The first training montage is heavy on its symbolism of nature vs. machine and showcases the beauty of the Russian wilderness. Ok, it's actually Wyoming but I can buy into it being a vast frozen expanse of the Soviet Union. But it's training montage number 2 which has to be my favourite training montage in film history. This is partly due to John Cafferty's Hearts on Fire - a motivating, pumping song if there ever was one. That synth, god I love it! In the spirit of everything in Rocky IV being larger than life, instead of running up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the montage ends with Rocky climbing a mountain.<br/><br/>The editing of Rocky IV also contributes to the film's bombastic nature. The transitional shots of magazine covers and newspaper articles make the film play out like more of a comic book than it already is. Likewise, shots such as that of Rocky's Russian chaperone looking into binoculars gets repeated three times within a few seconds but zoomed in further each time and edited to the rhythm of the score; it's just so cool. On the other hand, I even recall a review I heard for Star Wars: The Forces Awakens refer the final shot of that movie as a Rocky IV shot, in reference to the aerial shot of Rocky on top of the mountain. Is Rocky IV a more influential than the history books say?<br/><br/>Rocky IV is incredibly distant from the first movie but this is appropriate as Rocky is out of his element and in a foreign land. This is the only film in the series not to take place in Philadelphia unless you include the scene in the Balboa mansion although it's never made clear where the mansion is located. The No Easy Way Out montage provides you with clips from the first movie, so it the film itself allows you to bask in the stark contrast between the movies; a man who used to be a not very intelligent nobody and made money from prizefighting and working for a loan shark is now at the center of international politics.<br/><br/>Even the sheer predictably of Rocky IV is wonderful, such as when Adrian shows up in Russia to support Rocky; it's all cliché but in the best sense of the word. The build-up to the final fight and the atmosphere is so immense; there could never be a Rocky film more epic than this. By this point, I'm actually scared for Rocky and fearful for his life, and Paulie's emotional outpour before the fight, it gets me every time. I don't care what anyone says, this is the greatest fight in film history. Rules don't apply and Rocky somehow lasts the 15 rounds and even wins over the crowd (""Suddenly Moscow is pro-Rocky!""). This isn't just Rocky against another opponent, this is Rocky against a superhuman, a hostile crowd, a Mikhail Gorbachev lookalike and an entire world superpower. Keep your superhero movies with their city-destroying battles; this is what I call a duel! Rocky's final speech is naive in the most wonderful way. The words of the speech are so juvenile, yet when I hear Stallone utter them in the movie; it brings a tear to my eye. Did Rocky IV really help end the cold war? Who knows? Oh, and the end credits provide us with yet another awesome montage!<br/><br/>Rocky IV embodies the essence of capitalism the American Dream; if you work hard, success is attainable. I know many would just look at the movie and scoff at it as a simplified look at the Cold War with an ""us and them"" mentality. But as a piece of propaganda does it work? Oh, you bet it does. Rocky IV, I salute you to your over the top, cheesy 80's perfection.<br/><br/>Rocky IV > Citizen Kane"

","To start this film had many catching moments that really inspired me when i first saw this movie. without doubt my favorite of the rocky movies. no actor could have done a better job in this film. no actor could have made the role of Rocky more appealing to me than Stallone himself. i think it is ridiculous that a man with so much talent has been ridiculed by so many as the worst actor of the century. forget there comments on there ability to understand his voice, or there opinions on his direction in life. he has been beaten down physically in almost every major action film he has done to make it more than just another action movie. in this film he sees his best friends death at the hands of a soviet Juggernaut. falling apart knowing how much this friend had done for him he wants to avenge his fallen friend. he goes through hell and back to achieve this. he works harder than at any point in his life to avenge his friend. he gets the beating of his life, he takes blow after blow, one after the other by a raging Russian volcano but never backs down. He hits and hits him again and again relentlessly overpowered but never falters. he comes out on top and makes a moving speech of how faulty it was for the cold war to take place. i found this film as moving as any i have seen and the fight scenes make this truly a great action film. whats more of this film is how few people give this film credit or even recognize it as one of Stallones better films. i give this film a good word and i would watch this film any time i needed a little uplifting motivation. this is a good film...Hands down."

","Its the foundations to who I am today. Had I never scene it I would of never been inspired to pick up the weights & become a World champion bodybuilder! This is my personal favourite but not the best movie of the series.I am undecided between Rocky 1 & 2. Sly Stallone's life has just as been inspiring as his legendary character. He's had many ups & downs in his career & always prevailed. When he fist wrote Rocky he wanted to play the character & the studios laughed & Sly proved them wrong. Then 30 years later he wanted to finish the series with Rocky Balboa & the studios laughed at him again especially at 60! Sly proved them wrong again. We all need a modern day hero & Rocky is one of them. Sly has inspired people in the 70's, 80's, 90's & now the millennium. What other actor has done that? I'm sure he will do the same again with John Rambo!"

","Rocky IV really stood out from the rest of the Rocky films to me, with the whole America versus Russia ordeal. Now it has been mentioned by other critics that this is inaccurate, but who really cares??? The point is that you really get to the point where you want Sly to kick Dragos butt in the ring. I enjoyed the training montage, and the boxing scene was so entertaining for me. And with the Russian leaders, and the Russian public standing up and cheering and clapping for Rocko.. a bit corny but so great.Talia shire in my opinion is at her best in this one out of all the other ones; she seems more confident and easier to get along with her character. And one of the most dramatic scenes to hit cinema was the death of Carl Weathers(Apollo Creed). The idea of fighting for the death of his friend, and for himself is just so inspirational. It just makes you want to jump up and get in the ring to help rocko. Out of a perfect score of 10, i gave this one a 7."

","The year 1985 was a golden year for Stallone. After he was fired from Paramount pictures for Beverly Hills Cop (1984) movie, he went to make Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rocky IV. Sly wrote a script and directed beautiful the fourth action sequel Rocky movie. Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rocky IV earned over $300,000,000 worldwide, they were the moust successful and popular movies of the 80's. Commando wasn't so much successful movie in the 80's like these two were. This is my number 1 personal favorite Rocky movie a classic action film of the 80's revenge style. The best Rocky of all time. It was my first Rocky and Stallone film I saw as a kid. This is Stallone's personal favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>This movie made me in to a Rocky fan and a Stallone fan. My dad recommend me this movie and it was the reason, why I wanted to see all 4 movies. This was my first Rocky movie it is my father's favorite film. In my opinion all 4 Rocky movies are great. This is my number 1 favorite Rocky film of all time. This is the only Rocky movie that dosen't have song artist Bill Conti. At the time Bill Conti was so busy making music score for The Karate Kid Part II (1986) and he was unavailable. So Sly hired Vince DiCola for the music score and in my opinion it was the best music score, better than Bill Conti's that was dramatic to me.<br/><br/>""Excuse, please. You are not very realistic, are you, Mr Creed? What are you talkin' about? You can box, yes, but you are far too old to think you can win over Drago. - Is that a fact? - Yes! And it could be a painful one! Put that heavy bag with eyeballs in the ring with me and you'll see pain! - Why do you insult us? - Now you just hold on here. I'm not the bad guy. I came to talk about a friendly exhibition bout... ...till Comrade Bigmouth started up! - It is you who are the aggressor. I wish to say to the press, in all fairness... ...Drago should not even fight this man, because he is a has-been. You get that big chump in the ring right now... - Stop this before you get hurt. - I don't wanna hear! Let that chump go! All right, all right. I've said what I feel. - We'll finish this in the ring! - Wherever you like. You shut up, and all these puppets you brought with you! You're history, chump!""<br/><br/>This time Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) goes after new opponent The Siberian Bull Ivan Drago played by Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren. A fight in Las Vegas againts Apollo vs Drago in a friendly exhabition match, Drago kills after 2 rounds Apollo. Now Rocky (Sly) dicedies to avenge Apollo's death. Rocky chalenges Drago by him self in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement match unsanctioned 15-round bout. Rocky travels to Soviet Union to prepare against his most dangerous opponent of all time.<br/><br/>Why in my opinion is my number 1 favorite Rocky of all time and it is a perfect 10: One Way Street by Go West, Double Or Nothing by Bernard Edwards, Living In America, No Easy Way Out by Robert Tepper, Heart's On Fire Performed by John Cafferty Burning Heart by Frankie Sullivan and Jim Peterik and Sweetest Victory by Mark Torien great soundtracks that i love them to death. I love listening to them. I love Paulie's robot, I love how they shot the film. I love the press conferences with Apollo and later with Rocky by him self. I love the training sequence. The traning sequences in which Rocky and Drago are training is very inspirational. The fight in the finale is the best fight in any Rocky movie. Rocky and Drago really hit each other for real. Rocky comes back toward the end of the second round; a right hook inflicts a cut below Drago's left eye that silences the crowd and prompts Rocky to continue punching Drago even after the bell rings - my favorite action scene. Sly's choreography the boxing match was great. Sly was a natural talent that time in the 80's.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone's performance is the best in the movie ever, he is a real bad-ass champion at the top of the world. This movie should have ended the Rocky franchise, because this movie perfectly ended the franchise. Burt Young as Paulie Pennino was excellent in this movie. I love his acting performance and character to death. Dolph Lundgren as Captain Ivan Drago is the best of the whole movie. The actor become my father's favorite idiol and even as a kid I was thinking about Ivan Drago how is it to become him. He did not talk a lot he was quiet and wait on the right opportunity, until he strike hard without no mercy. Carl Weathers did return as Apollo Creed for the last time, until his character was killed. The fight between Apollo and Drago was for real because Lundgren really did throw Weathers out of the ring. Both men become a hostile so now they become enemies and Sly had to push them so they made their finals shots together. Brigitte Nielsen Danish model is in here too as Ludmilla Drago's wife. She was Sly's real wife at the time and she also stared opposite Sly in my favorite action film Cobra in 1986 a year after release of Rocky IV.<br/><br/>All right, all right. I've said what I feel I love this movie to death, been a huge Rocky IV fan even Talia Shire as Adrian Balboa was gorgeous in this movie and she did fine as Rocky's wife. I love this movie to death and everything about this movie I love it, it is fast paced it goes quickly around, it is long only 1hr and 20 mins without end credits."
"T-ZER0","9","6","7","1 August 2019"," The Darkest Rocky film, but possibly the greatest in pure heart.
","If any of you have seen my previous review on Rocky III. You know that's my favorite Rocky film, but that's not saying this one isn't good. Because the more I see it, the more great it gets with age.<br/><br/>Rocky is of course enjoying family life, when Ivan Drago (How to Train Your Dragon 2 stole his last name.) A Soviet boxer comes to America and challenges Rocky Balboa to an exhibition match. Apollo Creed wants to prove he's got what it takes, so he takes the match instead of Rocky. First thing to notice is that Apollo told Rocky that it's not just a match, it's them against Russia. And though Rocky didn't realize it, it was. It was an East vs West battle. Unfortunately Creed is killed when fighting Drago. Leaving Rocky to challenge him to avenge his good friend.<br/><br/>I have to had it to whoever chose the music for this film. The songs really pop on this soundtrack! Like ""No Easy Way Out"", ""Hearts On Fire"" and so much more.<br/><br/>What I love also is when Rocky arrives in Russia. The whole setting is like it's telling the viewer. ""This is Russia. Where that evil boxer Drago was born. He was trained and born in this awful place."" It really makes the resolve of Rocky even more powerful than ever.<br/><br/>After some really cool training montages and support from Adrian. Rocky faces Drago. It seemed impossible to beat Drago at first. But with Rocky's endurance and his pure heart, he beats Drago. Despite Drago training hard and using steroids. I also love Rocky's speech at the end, it wasn't long and thought out like most speeches, but you got what he was saying, and it really impacts your heart.<br/><br/>I am super glad I purchased this movie on Blu-Ray, and it's free on Prime Video right now! If only they could release it with Movies Anywhere. But really good film that will never get old!!"

When Rocky's early trainer Apollo Creed dies when the huge Russian Boxer Ivan Drago gets him in the head, Rocky isn't happy at all. This movie shows that Rocky has true emotion and that he loves his family and friends so much. Rocky tries so hard to be Drago, even being followed by two people that won't let him out of their sight. Rocky wins, with a tough fight, but with the Russians on his side, its a great win. The music is the best music in all the rocky movies such as ""Burning Heart"" and ""Theres no easy way out"", One of my personal favorites.

","I can remember seeing this before it was released in England, as a friend managed to get a copy from America. I'd always been a fan of the Rocky series so I was really looking forward to this & I wasn't disappointed! I must have seen the film about 10 times before it was released in Endland, then it was about 3 or 4 times seeing it at the cinema (back when this was released I would only have been about 6, so my parents must have been annoyed at taking me to the same film!). As soon as it was released on video I managed to obtain a copy, which probably lasted about 6 months. I also purchased the album, which contains one of the best montage songs ever (""No Easy Way Out"") and still have it to this day! I must have been through at least 10 copies on video & one DVD.<br/><br/>Obviously, the death of Apollo was heartbreaking to me, but Drago just seemed like a monster and I was eagerly awaiting the East Meets West clash in Russia, as Rocky avenges his friends death.<br/><br/>Such an amazing film and way better than Rocky 5 (and, in my opinion, the other films as well) so please check this out - I don't think it's dated well, but to those around in the 80's you should definitely watch this film as soon as possible!"
"charlessmith702210","10","9","12","2 February 2014"," Almost like the movie ""Bloodsport"", but with punches instead of kicks
","So, Rocky, knocking out Clubber Lane in Rocky III, is basking once again in the joys of being a heavyweight champion in Rocky IV, but then, Rocky and his friend, former boxing champion Apollo Creed, gets word that the USSR will enter the prizefighting world with their infamous tall guy, Ivan Drago.<br/><br/>As Ivan Drago and his wife and coach enter the USA and decide on a exhibition bout against either Rocky or Apollo, we see evidence of Ivan's devastating punching power. Apollo finally decides to take on that big Russian fighter even though Rocky is telling him this can be dangerous. But Apollo wants to still go at it, and Rocky decides to be his ringside coach.<br/><br/>So, at Las Vegas, the pre-bout festivities include James Brown's rendition of ""Living in America"", rigged to intimidate Ivan so much that he secretly swears to kill Apollo in the ring. And so, as the exhibition bout starts, Ivan gets his death wish, pummeling Apollo in Round 1, and then, in the middle of Round 2, finishes Apollo off with a killer uppercut that completely finishes him off, leaving him bleeding--and later on, dead--in the ring. Rocky could do nothing to stop Ivan's deadly anger and only could watch his friend wasted fatally in blood.<br/><br/>Rocky decides to avenge Apollo's death by placing his championship belt on Apollo's grave, and leaves it there. All is set for a boxing-style death match in the USSR on December 25 between Rocky and Ivan, where Rocky says no money will be paid. <br/><br/>Rocky's wife strongly reproaches Rocky's decision to fight Ivan, fearing that he could be facing the same death like what Ivan did to Apollo, but Rocky retorts that he has to use his extrovert mentality to overcome Ivan's killer punches. <br/><br/>So, as Rocky heads to the USSR to a place similar to Siberia, he meets up with Apollo's friend, starts his training for the fight (while Ivan does his own training under his coach and his wife) in the country's cold milieu, and after a pause in the training, Rocky realizes that his wife decided to go to Russia to meet up with him, saying ""I'm with you no matter what."" His training continues. <br/><br/>The training montage was definitely pretty good. Great camera work and inter-cutting as Rocky uses old-school training by things like pulling a sled, or throwing heavy stones, or breaking parts of trees with an ax, while Ivan was focusing on steroids, machines with computer readouts, and destroying sparring partners with his bone-crushing punches. <br/><br/>The fight itself was like a blood sport too. 15 very hard rounds, and it seemed like neither fighter would gain an advantage, but after the bloody punches were over, Rocky became the victor after finally knocking Ivan out in the 15th round. The hostile Russian crowd during the fight realized they could not be that anymore...they respected Rocky's awesome human determination in this non-sanctioned fight."

The villain is very intimidating, so intimidating that it makes you think Rocky could lose. The training montages were vastly improved from its previous films, and are less corny.

","Rocky 4, although it's considered predictable and sometimes very corny, is ""The True All-American Movie""...believe it or not. It's one of the only movies in history that's better than some of it's prequels (Rocky 2 and Rocky 3 can't even come close)and it's messages of revenge and patriotism is fascinating. The plot of an aging boxer who avenges his fellow boxer friend's death in a brutal boxing match proves that you can seek justice and revenge honestly (through a sport or by following the rules of society) and it takes a lot of hard work to get to the top. It's all worth it in the end. Oh, and I almost forgot, America is number one! The soundtrack of american pride is great (""Living In America"" and ""No Easy Way Out). The final scene is exciting, even though predictable, because we think to ourself ""I'm going to enjoy seeing Rocky kick this heartless communist's ass infront of the whole world... American Style"" and when it's all over, predictable or not, you feel wonderful on the inside and proud to be an american."
"gzeka","6","33","63","27 April 2005"," Oh my, Rocky slams it hard...
","Wow. Saw this one on TV after 15 years or so and I must admit it's one helluva piece of entertainment. Yeah, it has older-than-a-Bible James Brown,virtually no plot and non-moving actors like Lundgren and Nielsen....but,the last 20 minutes are hilarious to say the least. Drago(Lundgren)has a punch strength of about 2000 PSI,meaning his blows are twice harder than Tyson's, for example. He manages to hit Rocky in the head about 50 times and Rocky still survives 15 rounds. Not only survives, he wins and he even has enough juice to make a poignant speech. What surprises me is the amount of IMDb comments stating ""well, it's not that impossible, when you're focused on something you can endure pretty much etc"". First three movies in Rocky installment had somewhat credible storyline, although final fight with Clubber was fairly exaggerated. Here we have exaggeration multiplied by 50 : Drago kills Creed in round 2 and he uses same kind of attack on Rocky, he sends him 8 or 9 times on the floor and Rocky fights back for the first time in round 5.Come on, by that time he would have been already declared dead and received a Viking funeral.This movie is not all that bad, it has an excellent soundtrack and scene in which Rocky drives around reminiscing of his previous fights with ""No easy way out"" going in the back is touching, but fails miserably in department of plot development and credibility.Creed and Clubber were strong fighters but Rocky still had a decent chance against them, that made first three movies so believable. There's no way middle-aged midget like Balboa could have defeated someone with superhuman abilities like Drago...But I assume USA needed a patriotic boost in a midst of Cold War and Stallone certainly provided it with Rambo 3 and Rocky 4."

"barnabyrudge","5","28","54","31 January 2007"," A film so silly and unbelievable that it actually rises above criticism on normal terms.
","The fourth Rocky movie retreats into a realm of fantasy that has to be seen to be disbelieved. It is by far the dumbest movie in the series, with a plot that defies credibility, and a closing boxing match that would surely prove fatal for both fighters if a contest like it were to take place in real life. What the film has in its favour is a sense of courage in its own absurdity. It's like everybody involved knows that they're working on something ludicrous, but they give it their all anyway  the actors, the cinematographer, the composer, the editor and the director all pull in the same direction, united in some kind of cheerful conviction that they can make an enjoyable movie from this silliest of premises.<br/><br/>Life is good for boxing champion Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone). He has a mansion, he has money, he has incredible public support and he has the all-important heavyweight champion of the world title. But news is spreading fast that there might be a better boxer on the face of the planet in the shape of Russian goliath Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Drago comes to America for an exhibition match against Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), once Rocky's greatest adversary and now Rocky's greatest friend. The match is supposed to be a straightforward contest for Creed, giving him a chance to reassert himself as a top fighter, but it goes terribly wrong when Drago literally pulverises his opponent and kills him in the ring. Distraught at the death of his buddy, Rocky agrees to fight Drago. The venue: Moscow. The date: December 25th. In the middle of desolate northern Russia, Rocky trains for the fight of his life against a near-superhuman opponent. Not only is the honour of his dead friend at stake, but so is his life. not to mention the hopes of every man, woman and child from the free world! <br/><br/>It seems kind of wrong for a Rocky movie to go all political on the audience, but Rocky IV indirectly does just that. Rocky's closing speech is a cringe-worthy plea for tolerance and change amongst the different societies of our world, and if I hadn't heard it with my own ears I would scarcely have believed anyone could put such infantile politics on film. The movie is much better when it concentrates on the sport aspects, especially the pulsating training sequences. With rapid-fire editing and rousing music, these parts of the film are quite inspirational and make you want to get out of your chair and put yourself through your paces in a gym as soon as possible! The final fight itself is a pretty exciting sequence but, given the fact that the film shows us that Drago has an impossibly strong punching-power, one finds it rather hard to believe that Rocky could still be standing after fifteen seconds let alone fifteen rounds. Rocky IV is totally unrealistic, totally simple-minded. and totally entertaining if you look upon it as a guilty pleasure!"

","Sylvester Stallone has done his fair share of ridiculous movies but this one takes the cake. The fact that it was shot during the cold war isn't really a valid excuse for the horribly stereotyped Russians. The entire Russian population seems to consist of people totally devoid of emotion with their sole reason for existence being to humiliate Americans. Even the country itself is stereotyped in that 80's American way where every shot inside the Soviet Union has to be in mid winter. Naturally Mister Balboa and his crew arrive there during a snow storm.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are as badly cliched as the the rest of the movie. I'm not too interested in boxing but even I know that punches don't sound like that, and no one gets hit as heavily and over such a long period of time as Dolph and Sly get during their bout and actually live. Of course the fight follows the ""our hero gets badly beaten but then rises to beat the baddie and win over the crowd"" cliche. No excuses for giving away the ending here, someone with the IQ of Rambo could see this one coming.<br/><br/>Dolph Lundgren is meant to play the robotic Russian fighting machine and as such has to play no emotion except to follow his programmed routine of hate for his enemies. This suits his acting abilities well. He does get one of the best lines in the movie, and virtually his only line when he introduces himself to Rocky in the ring with ""I must break you!""<br/><br/>The little plot that the movie has is padded out with sequences of bad 80's music that play like music videos. The movie is quite laughable in some places but the constant flag waving does get a bit much so this movie is not even in the ""so bad it's funny"" category.

It's a ""guilty pleasure"" only in the sense that having a dominatrix snap a wet towel at your bare buns in a guilty pleasure.  Rocky goes through his usual homey and decidedly low-tech training routine, schlepping a huge log up a mountainside, carrying it like a yoke across his shoulders.  (Oh, Lord, let us hope this wasn't intended as a religious allusion.)  Dolf Lundgren, who cannot act, is a sullen Aryan monster.  He's given a lousy haircut, in case we might not get the point, and even sports a black mouthpiece in the ring, in case we missed the haircut too.  Stallone almost always has non-Latins in the role of the heavies.  A couple of African-Americans, an Irish gang in Paradise Alley, a Nordic here, an Eskimo there.  I wonder if he knows exactly what he's trying to tap into, what tribal animadversions are oozing out of his cortical sulci.  He practically converts the Soviet Union to capitalism at the end. And all those years we were sending people like Louis Armstrong and Benny Goodman around as Goodwill Ambassadors.  Let's see.  Drago -- great name! -- can land a punch that packs 2,000 pounds per square inch.  That's 131.5789474 times the force of gravity at sea level.

"jeremycrimsonfox","9","2","2","9 August 2019"," A Tale Of Revenge In The Boxing Ring
","Rocky IV is another good entry, but unlike Rocky III, it actually changes up the story to make things fresh. Picking up where the last film left off, the story is Soviet boxing champion Ivan Drago (played by Dolph Lungdren) comes to the U.S. to enter the professional boxing circuit, causing Apollo Creed to come out of retirement to face the monster in an exhibition match, which ends with the former nemesis of the Italian Stallion getting killed in the ring. Rocky, feeling guilt over allowing his death to happen, despite his best efforts to make Apollo stop the match, decides to challenge Ivan, with the match taking place in Moscow.<br/><br/>Yeah, the story is changed up compared to the last three films, which reused the formula of main hero coming from the bottom to rise to the top as an underdog, the story in Rocky IV can be seen as a revenge story, as Rocky agrees to fight Ivan due to Apollo's death. Also, there are some silly moments (like Apollo's entrance, which has James Brown singing Living In America), but the story and characters are good, and while the movie is tied to the Cold War that was erupting at the time, I tend to ignore politics and stick to the elements I like. Worth checking out if you like boxing."
"corleone1972","10","10","18","29 March 2005"," In defense of this movie...
","This comment is in defense of Rocky IV, which upon my first viewing was regarded as propagandizing trash.<br/><br/>First, this is an excellent movie to contribute to the rocky mythos because of its capturing of the chronological change in a professional fighter's life. Sly Stallone (Rocky) does an excellent job in writing this movie in that he takes into account the monetary aspect of a successful fighters life, the world-weary syndrome of 'losing your edge', and finally redemption of a *personal* ideal.<br/><br/>Rocky in this movie is a man who is *societally* successful-- he has a loving supportive wife, a maldisformed child, enough money to need everything he may want, and a supportive friends structure. He is quite possibly beyond his prime, and now all he has to do is look back on the old days nostalgically.<br/><br/>This is when we have the introduction of the Russian-- this otherworldly modernly trained fighter who seems manufactures by our modern culture (yes, its the 80's) but nevertheless, manufactured. His old buddy is defeated at the hands of the modern fighter-- but leaves Rocky with an important message: To never forget who he is, and his killer instinct. This is when ""Rocky IV"" collides with Tennyson's ""Ulysses"". Two men-- grasping for their past, but never forgetting who they are. It is a story of personal redemption and gratification as much as a political statement about the change in society and the loss of the self. where fabrication overrides self worth.<br/><br/>To all that think this is propaganda: This movie is simply NOT propaganda. If you watch the movie, you realize that when the Russian crowd 'turns' on Drago and roots for Rocky-- that they too change. Rocky in his non-eloquent way basically states that the battle between two men in a ring, is analogous to 20 million fighting on battlefield. Why must we fight, and kill-- when we can discuss-- have two ideals battle for the victor. And according to Rocky IV the victor is the self-- the human spirit-- Drago claims to fight for himself-- not for his manufacturers.<br/><br/>Finally-- a side note--- Russian s look stereotyped-- but are not. Rusiia is shown in wintertime because the fight is on December 25th-- to us in the northern hemisphere Rusiia has winter too. And on their 'lack of emotion'-- they turn and support rocky in the end-- how is that lacking emotion? Thus i give this movie a 10/10. It accomplishes what it needs to-- triumphantly-- and is commonly overlooked because of its relative 'outdatedness'.<br/><br/>(PS forgive grammatical/spelling errors)"
"dfle3","1","32","74","4 July 2008"," The nadir of the series
","This was the movie which put me off seeing Stallone movies for years. I was a huge fan of his first three Rocky movies (which I consider to be great/classic) and ""First Blood"" (the first of the ""Rambo"" movies).<br/><br/>In Rocky IV, Stallone turns the inspiring story of a no-name boxer who becomes world champion into part of the Cold War culture battle between the USA and USSR. Every opportunity is taken to portray Russians in an unflattering light...as drug taking cheats or what not (ironic, seeing as how the US Olympic team is now so heavily tainted by the ""drug cheats"" smear).<br/><br/>Stallone really embraced President Reagan's Cold War views on Russia. After reading some plot details of the sequel to ""First blood"", I thought I'd give that movie a miss. I'm still yet to see that movie. Sounds like another Cold War, anti-Russian piece of propaganda. If you are a fan of President Reagan and loved his characterisation of the USSR as an Evil Empire, deserving nuclear annihilation (personally, I didn't find that 'joke' of Reagan's funny, as it smeared an entire people with the muddy term ""evil""), then I think you will have a lot to like in this film. It will confirm all your views about the US and USSR.<br/><br/>It wasn't until a couple of years ago, I think, that I finally saw the next installment in this franchise...it was on commercial TV and on very late at night...might have even been the premier of Rocky V! In that film, Stallone, via Rocky Balboa, seems to backtrack from the excesses of Rocky IV. He seems to retract what he was saying in that movie. It was still a very silly movie (no doubt the next worst film in this series), but I'm curious now to see the latest in the franchise, ""Rocky Balboa"". Could be fun.<br/><br/>Really, this movie is part of the Stallone oeuvre where you could bill his movies as ""Produced by the Pentagon. Directed by the CIA"". In other words, pure political propaganda, which played a part in Reagan's Cold War against the USSR.<br/><br/>The nadir of the series."

And then the members of Politburo (ALL OF THEM) go to watch a professional boxing match between their beloved machine and an American hero. Absolutely fantastic! Now, what planet is the movie set on again?"
"mjadeebs41","10","7","12","21 December 2007"," This Cinematic Masterpiece Should be Up With the Likes of Casablanca, the Godfather, and Gone With the Wind
","This cinematic masterpiece is the most under-appreciated film of our time. Explain to me this, how can we as Americans not appreciate the fact that without the contributions of American hero Rocky Balboa in this film, the Cold War would still be going on. When Rocky delivers his monologue, it is perhaps one of the best speeches known to man. Sure there was that Lincoln fellow in his Address to the Gettysburgians, and the Martin Luther King fellow. But as influential as their speeches were, none compare to the magnitude and the repercussions that this speech brought about. For all of those individuals who lived in the time of the Cold War, they know that life was tough, to put it simply. And without this man's bravado and courageousness, we'd still be in a time of nuclear proliferation and fear. This man put his body and mind on the line, and even came out with severe brain damage as a result. A true patriot he is, along with the likes of William Wallace and Tyrone Hill, and what they each brought to their countries. Drago was a representation of all that was wrong in the world. Steroids, corruption, communism, and pure hatred. But even he, the abominable monstrosity that he was, couldn't defeat the Italian Stallion himself. But despite what one man's force can do, the power of words is enough to conquer a nation, as Rocky did with this monologue.<br/><br/>""During this fight, I've seen a lot of changing, in the way you feel about me, and in the way I feel about you. In here, there were two guys killing each other, but I guess that's better than twenty million. I guess what I'm trying to say, is that if I can change, and you can change, everybody can change!"" The sheer power, diction, and confidence that he brought upon that Russian crowd conquered the Soviet Union, and began the fall of communism. When I saw this film, and more importantly the monologue, I was feeling perhaps what Moses felt when he saw the Burning Bush on the Mountain of Sinai. A rush of adrenaline, passion, and invigoration that no one has ever felt before.<br/><br/>So I call upon you, as Americans, to step forth from this day with a new sense of pride and patriotism, for there is good in a world smug with so much evil and prejudice. May the power and grace of Rocky's words bless you all as if they've done upon myself.<br/><br/>EVERYBODY CAN CHANGE, so can you."

Then there is the music video montage of Rocky and Apollo - get a room, guys! The fight scene with Drago was worse than a Popeye cartoon. You know - Bluto just beats him until he cracks open that can of spinach. Now if you don't believe me, count it yourself - Rocky got punched full force in the face fifty (50) times in the first round!!! That's right - fifty times!!! During the course of the fight, he was punched in the face over 200 times!! That's more than any boxer got tagged in their entire career - they would have been in a coma had this happened to them.

","Never, ever should a movie involve politics. The first 3 Rocky movies were great (the first was awesome) but with this one the producers decided they wanted more money and so they used the political war between USA and USSR to attract the audience. <br/><br/>The way they make Russians look is ridiculous (it's so bad that is not good, it's so bad you laugh because how bad it is - when the Russians synchronized applause) and flags everywhere(at a time I thought that I would see my countries flag - Romania, with so many flags in there). <br/><br/>Further more they shouldn't have killed Apollo, I mean in the third movie Mickey died and now another key character dies. After he died I said to myself ""Damn, I should have foreseen that"". <br/><br/>And ""Russia"" really doesn't look like Russia(where are the Reagan wanted posters?). But really, I realize that they could not film in Russia, but they could at least try to make it look like it was filmed there(some orthodox churches, some people from village should have said something to Rocky in Russian, things like this). <br/><br/>The last complain I have is that the movie feels like a joke: Apollo's entrance to the match, Drago's lines like ""You will lose""(or something like that). It's so cheesy, actually it's to cheesy. <br/><br/>All in all Rocky 4 doesn't compare to the masterpiece that was Rocky or even to Rocky 2 & 3 which were great movies. To much politics. I know it's a propaganda movie(yes, that's what it is. Look for the definition of propaganda and compare to this movie), but it fails even at this. The Rambo series (2 & 3 and recently ""John Rambo"") were also propaganda movies but they were awesome(actually they were so bad they were awesome). <br/><br/>Anyway if you want to laugh a bit you can watch this movie, but don't have the same expectations you had before watching each of the first 3 Rocky movies."

Cold War metaphors delivered with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer dampens the storytelling. Should have stopped at three. Four, no more. A camp classic, funny for all the wrong reasons. There are simply too many ludicrous elements to ignore: Paulie's robot; Brigitte Nielsen, even less expressive than the robot; about a thousand music-video-styled montages; Lundgren's delivery of Drago's deadly dialogue and much more. The crazed flag-waving would be a lot easier to take if it weren't so clearly a commercial calculation meant to salvage what is otherwise a crass, careless, shamelessly padded film. Ridiculous jingoistic nonsense. Even the hint of political power that Rocky garners by the end of this latest battle is made to seem like more of the same empty glory.

","As a kid I used to watch this movie endlessly with my friends and brothers. It always had an aspect that I found so powerful; having no pain. No matter what comes our way, you fight your way through the pain in life till the end. Apollo dies and Rocky has to fight for his vengeance. It was always so heartlfelt to me that Rocky fought for those he loved. He examplified the importance of having no pain and fighting for his true desire and love. I'll be the first to admit that this movie is pure fantasy but it was powerful to me. I also connected with Rocky's character and knew that he had flaws but yet he just never gave up and kept on punching.
Growing up, I picked up on cheesy parts but it still delivered the same chills and motivation as I got older. This movie has its faults but it's so meaningful and the action is near perfect. Literally the biggest problem to me now is Rocky barely blocks at all! If only he did, along with some tweaking, this movie would earn a well deserved 10/10.

"jmm236","10","3","4","20 March 2005"," The perfect combination of training, fighting and flashbacks
","The Rocky formula was never worked to complete perfection like it was in Rocky IV. Narrowing the film down to its most essential elements, Rocky IV is comprised almost entirely of flashbacks, training montages, and brutal fights. The flashbacks help catch the uninitiated viewer up to speed, yet are not a hindrance to the seasoned Rocky vet. The knowledge of the scenes shown in the flashbacks enhances the emotional charge of the film. The training sequences are top notch, and some of the longest to be found in the entire Rocky franchise. Not only that, but they involve some of Rocky's most unconventional techniques. He does sit ups hanging off of a barn loft, lifts wooden carts in place of weights, and runs up and down mountains instead of on a treadmill. Perhaps nothing is as entertaining as the chicken chasing found in Rocky III, but it comes dangerously close. The fights scenes are appropriately brutal. Specifically, the death of Apollo Creed is one of the most shocking moments in sports movie history, as only a man with a heart of stone will fail to be moved by Rocky holding his dear companion's dying body in his arms. The final fight is one of the best in the Rocky repertoire. It goes the full 15, giving each boxer ample time to land enough punches to kill 3 fighters. Finally, and this is not to be overlooked, Rocky IV includes some of the greatest unintentional comedy found in any movie of any genre. Every time a Russian speaks is a cause for laughter. Ivan Drago is one of the most unbelievable movie characters of all time, delivering such lines as ""If he dies, he dies"" without the slightest hint of humanity. The last scene, in which Rocky triumphantly declares, ""If I can change, and you can change, then EVERYBODY CAN CHANGE!"" would be hilarious enough for it words. But the fact that this asinine dribble wins over the hostile Russian crowd is what places this scene atop the pantheon of unintentionally comedic moments. All in all, with its perfect combination of classic Rocky elements and its ability to create comedy in the most unexpected places, Rocky IV is the perfect Rocky movie, and a crowning achievement for all of mankind."

In this episode, writer-director-star Stallone spends ninety minutes (in between blatant product plugs) giving celebrity advice and selfless encouragement to everyone around him, including, in the end, the whole of humanity, wrapping himself in the stars and stripes to plead for universal peace and goodwill after slugging the hell out of his Soviet man-machine adversary."

"aribackjimmy","1","11","24","20 June 2005"," It makes no sense
","I'd actually like to give this less than zero, but before I rant on it, I would like to say something interesting. Those Rocky fanatics, who are a pathetic race, will recall in Rocky III, when Apollo takes Rocky to L.A. to train against Clubber Lang, and Paulie gets on Apollo's nerves, Rocky says,"" he grows on you, it just takes six years,"" Apollo responds ""I ain't got six years"" how right you were Apollo, how right you were. Now let's think of this logically. Your friend is killed by somebody, your natural response is to fist fight him, because afterwords, when the fight is over, if you hit him more times then he hits you, it will make up for your friends death. Does that makes any sense what so ever? Hasn't Rocky heard of a gun? Who's weiner did sly have to suck to get this piece off the ground. What makes the film even funnier, is that we find out in Rocky five, that when Rocky went to Russia, his accountant took all of his money, and the fight with Drago damaged his eye so much that he can't make any more real money as a boxer, so its back to having nothing, like he started. I know, I have way to much knowledge about the Rocky films, but that's what happens when it airs on T.N.T., EVERY DAY!, BUT THEY DON'T AIR THE ONLY GOOD ONE, THE ORIGINAL ROCKY!. It's also kind of funny they had James Brown is in this Rocky, who would eventually go to jail a few years after airing this film. Hmm too think that when Apollo Creed handpicked Rocky in the first movie, that he killed himself, if he doesn't meet Rocky, Rocky doesn't beat the heck out of him, making him into a shell of a fighter, who gets killed in a point-less match, in which the same Rocky, doesn't throw in the towel when he should have. The irony is so thick. Rocky's original idea is based on Chuck Wepner, and then after that it's base don Joe Frazier, from the bad eye, training by hitting meat, and being from Philly, as far as I recall Frazier never fought some dirty stinking Russian though. Now he did fight Mr. T., (they call him George Foreman in real life), that's why Rocky loses in two rounds, Frazier, lost to Foreman in two rounds, in their heavyweight title fight of 1973. The fight was after Frazier's manager died, wow ain't that interesting, didn't Rock'y manager approach death before the T. fight, quite a similarity. You see Stallone can't do anything creative on his own, he stole the idea of Rocky from Wepner who actually went through all the real stuff, and he stole other stuff from Joe Frazier, this movie marks Stallon coming up with an idea on his own, and it involves fighting some big Russian for U.S. pride. No wonder this movie won for worst movie of the year. Also, now granted Apollo was past his prime, but if all these movies were true, then that means Rocky and Apollo were about even at the beginning, with each fighter winning one fight, but then a guy who is good enough to kill Apollo, is not good enough simply to win against Rocky. That's a pretty big gap, almost as much as the gaping hole in which Stallon's career jumped in to by making this trash, someone called a film."
"Don-102","2","17","41","1 January 1999"," An embarrassing addition to the Rocky series.
","This terrible addition to the saga of Rocky Balboa, Philadelphia's ""favorite son"", is an embarrassment.  It is a completely lifeless, emotionless film, that plays like a group of music videos instead of meaningful scenes giving insight into any of the characters.  It is not only a far cry from the brilliant original, one of my own personal favorites, but a slap in the face to fans of the first film.  Why do we need to see a cold war allegory represented by a boxer from South Philly?  This is the basis of the film, which begins with an exhibition bout between Apollo Creed and Russian fighter Ivan Drago.  Apollo dies in the ring, so Rocky must set things right with the free world by fighting Drago in Russia.  Gee, who will win?<br/><br/>One of the film's most annoying ploys is the casting, by Stallone, of his soon-to-be-wife Briggite Nielsen.  In order to make space for her in the cast, Stallone completely underwrites the Drago character, rendering him virtually speechless.  This allows the Nielsen character, Drago's wife, to speak for him and have herself a nice amount of screen time.  This gimmick is about as artificial to filmmaking as Stallone's marriage to Nielsen turned out to be.<br/><br/>Stallone replaced Bill Conti's familiar and surging music score with a juiced-up, synthesized score I guess he felt was more modern.  Huge mistake. 1) The types of films the Rocky series represent are as old as Hollywood itself.  Conti's score enhanced this fact and help to make the original rise above the usual rags to riches movies that come out practically every year. 2) The new score is used to make a series of MTV-like videos poorly disguised as human drama.<br/><br/>I guess a movie that runs about 90 minutes and features a 5-minute flashback sequence can't be very fresh or good anyway."

","The first and immediately subsequent Rocky movies are fantastic. Sly plays an interesting underdog character who nearly anyone can sympathise with. Coupled with gritty training sequences and desperate punch-ups to follow, both are excellent movies.<br/><br/>The third was disappointing and the fourth a disgrace. Many have mentioned the unfathomable aspects of the movie but have neglected the downright absurd. For starters, a Robot as birthday present to Paulie in a Rocky movie. If anyone could have guessed after having seen the first two then I applaud you. How and why? When viewing the first Rocky movie, one is compelled to sympathise and to feel good for Rocky, which is why it is excellent. The fourth, on the other hand, does very little to arouse any emotion at all, has infantile humour, and an ending that brought tears to my eyes. Rocky is so likable because hes a simpleton who quintessentially doesn't give up. This is changed completely in four, where Rocky preaches about ""useless war"" in the most ridiculous possible way. When the Russian politicians applaud his words of a five year old's wisdom, one can only laugh.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is worse than many Schwarenegger movies. They have many similarities but Arnold movies don't try to boast a political message, they are intended to be mindless and action packed. You can appreciate them because they accomplish exactly what they aim to. This movie may be liked but not in the way it originally intended.<br/><br/>Terrible"

After Apollo Creed dies Rocky fights Ivan Drago for no money because the fight to him is not about money it is about ""keeping Creed's spirit alive and making sure that he didn't die for nothing"". Rocky fights in Russia where everyone hates him because he is American but during the fight the crowd sees Rocky's deep determination and his deep meaning and soon cheers for him instead of their sportsman Ivan Drago because he is fighting for nothing, he is fighting only to win. Rocky is fighting for something much deeper and the crowd can see that. Rocky puts everything that he is into this fight and that is why he wins. Rocky's speech after he wins though says it all. ""In here there were two guys killing each other but I guess thats better than fifty million. What I am trying to say if if I can change and if you can change, everybody can change"". This is why I love this movie so much it shows the meaning of determination and the meaning of love and what is worth fighting for."

","Rocky IV (1985, Dir. Sylvester Stallone) <br/><br/>Rocky Balboa accompanies his friend Apollo Creed to the rings in a boxing match against a Russian Boxers named Ivan Drago. Drago is too strong for Creed, and unfortunately kills him in his match. Balboa blames himself Creed's death and is determined to defeat Drago in a boxing match. He gains the help of Creed's former manager, Duke and travels to U.S.S.R to take on Drago.<br/><br/>'Rocky IV' is unfortunately not as good as the previous three films. There are even parts which seem to have basically been repeated. Apollo Creed's death is emotional, but you can't help but think that you have already seen it again. Like the other films, the actors are back and as great as they have ever been. The action is great and the basic story is quite interesting. It's not as fun as the other films, but should be seen if you have seen the other films.<br/><br/>""To beat me, he will have to kill me."" - Rocky (Sylvester Stallone)"
"ironhorse_iv","7","4","7","15 May 2014"," Yo, Adrian! Rocky IV was pretty fun to watch!
","The Rocky Series has gone from being Oscar Winner Motion Picture to Over the Top Cheese fest. Rocky IV may be weird, but it's still fun to watch! After all, Rocky IV is most financially successful entry in the Rocky franchise. At less, it's not unwatchable as Rocky V. Rocky IV is probably one of those movies where you should leave logic and reasoning at the door and just have a wild time. I can't hate this movie. It's a guilty pleasure to watch. It's gloriously over the top. Written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, the movie starts off, with Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) enjoy his life, after his big win fight from 1982's Rocky 3. The fun is short-lived, as Soviet boxer, Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is looking to dethrone the reigning boxer champions of America. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove to himself that, he still got it, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. The results were not in his favors as Drago beats Apollo mercilessly. Incensed by Drago's cold indifference and feeling a deep sense of guilt, Rocky decides to avenge Apollo's lost by agreeing to fight Drago in Russia on Christmas Day in an unsanctioned 15-round bout. Can Rocky beat the Russian, or will Drago prove to the world, how great, he is as a super athlete? It's awesome to see the near titan like figure of a maxed out Dolph Lundgren towering over the much smaller Stallone. You really can see him as a big challenge to Rocky Balboa even if the plot is pretty damn predictable. Lundgren as Ivan Drago is fine. . I do love the great one-liners from Drago throughout this film. Drago remind me a lot of Max Schmeling. Schmeling was a German boxer who fought Joe Louis in two fights that were seen as conflicts between the United States and Nazi Germany, the same way Drago's fights with Apollo and Rocky were Cold War conflicts. And like Schmeling, Drago dramatically won the first fight and received a vicious beating in the second, the major difference being Joe Louis was avenging his previous loss instead of the death of a friend. Max Baer, another fighter from the same era as Louis and Schmeling, may have been another influence, as Baer killed a man in the ring in a rather similar manner to how Drago end Apollo Creed. The action scenes are great, but Rocky hasn't really been known for boxing realism from the get go. Filming the fighting scenes was a nightmare, as additionally, Stallone claimed that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit due to being too aggression. Indeed, Stallone also got injury by Lundgren, due to the fact, that Lundgren punched him so hard in the chest, Stallone's heart had slammed up against his breastbone and began to swell, cutting off the blood supply and restricting the oxygen flow throughout the body. He nearly died. The cold war propaganda backdrop is a bit cartoony, as the Russians fighter is so one-dimensional evil. I do have to say, Brigitte Nielsen as Drago's wife is amazing add on. She was so fine, back then. Not only did Stallone made the Russians made out to be vicious, but also cheaters, due to the illegal steroids use. The movie makes sure to make Rocky look good, as his character use old fashion hard work farm training to get his muscle tone. Honestly, throwing heavy logs, chops down trees, pulls an overloaded snow sleigh, jogs and even climb a mountain in heavy snow and treacherous icy conditions isn't a very healthy way to train for a fight as a boxer can get back & neck problems. It's so over the top unrealistic. In truth, Sylvester Stallone also cheated to get his body in shape, by using steroids for training for the movie. So all that training montage is damn shame, misleading. I do like the supporting characters returning back, but the film really gave them nothing to work with. Paulie (Burt Young) just accompany Rocky everywhere and use for a bunch of awful jokes like him owning a robot. Yes, a robot, just go with it! Talia Shire as Adrian, just does the old, I'm mad at you wanting to fight routine. It's so tired some. Sylvester Stallone Rocky Balboa here is so far from the Rocky Marciano mixed with Joe Frazier and inspired by Chuck Wepner, Rocky from the first movie. It really feels like two different people. They don't even have ""scrolling Rocky"" logo in the opening. The world peace speech in the end was somewhat lost in translation as I couldn't understand, a word, he was saying. The movie did give us some great music. 'Hearts On Fire' by John Cafferty, ""No Easy Out' by Robert Tepper, and 'Living in America' by James Brown are great songs. Still, I really hoping for the Bill Contri 'Gonna fly now' to make appearance in the film. Vince DiCola did a good job with the soundtrack. Overall: a very enjoyable film with some good 1980's film cheese."

","I know that it was tempting to Sly to keep making Rocky movies. They made money and people liked the character. The character made Sly. Sure, he had the Rambo character to fall back on, but this was his original love. However, Rocky IV is so horrible, that it momentarily causes us to forget how much we loved the original. It could be said that other than the original and maybe Rocky III, this series has been a disaster. In Rocky IV we have singing robots, more friends dying, plenty of red-baiting and final fight that is so unrealistic, that the WWF would have never aired it. Rockey literally is beaten to a pulp. He is knocked down more than eight times and takes twenty shots in the head before being able to get his hands up. No person could ever survive that beating and no referee would have ever let that beating continue. I guess, the pro-American Rocky vs. the Dirty Communist Drago was good red meat in 1985, with Reagan's America. But looking back at it now, you have to wonder how Sly had the nerve to come back with one more movie?"

"gangstahippie","8","3","5","30 June 2007"," Much different from Rocky 1 but still entertaining
","Rated PG for Violence.<br/><br/>Rocky 1 was an Oscar-winning film with great acting,storyline,drama etc.Rocky 2 also had the drama and Rocky III had more action but still mixed drama into the storyline.Rocky IV came out and it was much different from the first film.This film is basically a revenge film which trades the original Bill Conti score for an all new heart-pumping 1980's soundtrack.I think the soundtrack in this film is better but that's probably because I like the type of music.The film's storyline and acting may not be that good especially in comparison to the first Rocky film but the movie is very fun and it should keep you entertained for the short 1hr and 30min run time.This film and Rambo First Blood Part II were both films that portray the Russians as villains.Back in 1985, when both films were released, the USA and Russia were enemies and that is what contributed to the box office.This film and Rambo 2 were big high grossing movies.In this one, a Russian boxer named Ivan Drago(Dolph Lundgren) challenges American boxer's to fight.Apollo Creed who has retired earlier, wants to fight him.During the match, he puts on a big show about America with James Brown singing.However, Ivan Drago who is very strong, kills Apollo in the ring.Drago does not seem very sorry that he killed him, so then Rocky Balboa decides to travel to Moscow, Russia to fight Drago.So he goes to Russia, trains in the show with heart-pumping 1980's music playing and then fights Drago in which is one of the best fight's in the series.Rocky IV may not have the good storyline of the first two films but it is a very fun and entertaining movie."
"ReelCheese","6","3","5","5 April 2007"," Hollow, But Still Fun
","Can you blame Sylvestor Stallone? The unpretentious Rocky Balboa turned him from a nobody into a superstar in 1976, and in the ensuing years made he (and his studio) filthy rich with one blockbuster sequel after another. And while ROCKY IV was another box office knockout, it is a completely artificial film lacking so many of the qualities that made The Italian Stallion an icon.<br/><br/>In a desperate bid to give Rocky motivation for another round, we are introduced to the heartless, 'roid-shooting Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren, as you know). Drago was more or less a good idea, as he is an unknown factor, completely unlike any force Rocky has encountered before. But the character at times comes off as laughable. After pummeling the soon-to-expire Apollo Creed, Drago states simply, ""If he dies, he dies."" Evil... pure evil! He's more of a cardboard villain than an opposing athlete.<br/><br/>ROCKY IV also awkwardly tries to tap into the tensions of the Cold War. The silly intro sequence even shows two boxing gloves, one American and the other Russian, smashing together and exploding(!). Then there's Rocky's somewhat lame post-bout speech about how we can all come together and live in happiness... after just pounding the opposing country's most esteemed athlete. It seems painfully clear that Stallone was running short on ideas for the series, and perhaps should have waited another year or two so he could flesh out a better script.<br/><br/>For all the things ROCKY IV isn't, it's certainly concise. With a running time of 90 minutes, the film is fun, but ultimately unsatisfying, particularly when we know from other entries how endearing the ROCKY saga should be."
"Cloud-6","10","3","5","27 February 1999"," The fourth sequel, surprisingly with the most punch!
","What has Rocky been about? Rocky sums it up in this movie with the line ""Maybe this fights not against him... it's you against you,"" I feel music is of prime importance to a film, I thought Vince DiCola's training montage and the ring music were absolutely brilliant. This film showed Rocky's passion more than ever, the human spirit is indomitable. Much of the film focused on Rocky's training, a hellish, and trying ordeal that would make someone wonder why Rocky could accomplish the impossible. The death of a loved friend set his soul ablaze, and he put out the fire in the end. It's a very emotional movie, I think it is the best of the Rocky series, with 3 coming in close behind."
"louiseemmalow","10","4","8","7 October 2005"," Excellent
","Loved this film - i have become a bit of a Rocky addict and I think that this film helps bring the Rocky story to its peak. Once you've seen I, II and III you'll understand why. Slyvester Stallone plays one of his best roles and you can never get tired of watching him in Rocky. He plays the role so well you can believe that Rocky exists as a person.<br/><br/>I think I especially like Rocky IV because of the the plot line and was left feeling empowered from watching it. Bringing war and politics into something as simple as boxing is well done.<br/><br/>I like Dolph too - its very clever how he does not have much script, giving him a mysterious and strong feel to his character!"
"Geeky Randy","10","2","3","4 December 2014"," Geeky Randy's summary
","Most financially successful entry in the ROCKY series follows Stallone as the titular character—as well as his pals Apollo Creed (Weathers), Adrian Balboa (Shire), Duke Evers (Burton), Paulie Pennino (Young) and Paulie's robot—as he gives support to formal rival and current best friend Creed, who has decided to take on an immensely muscular 6½ foot 260+ pounder named Ivan Drago (Lundgren) from the Soviet Union. Good luck, Apollo. Not a bad film by any means, but it's definitely a guilty pleasure that has dated quite poorly. James Brown's cameo as himself is fun, and Cafferty's ""Hearts on Fire"" is almost as classic as Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"".<br/><br/>**½ (out of four)"

","After Drago, an intimidating 6-foot-5, 261-pound Soviet boxer, literally destroys Creed in an exhibition match, Rocky goes to the heart of Russia for 15 pile-driving boxing rounds of revenge. Stallone is a unique presence in North American cinema and hopefully will do more of these kinds of austere, gripping character pieces in the future. The film's screenplay is tight and well-written, and it's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. Unfairly dismissed by some as confusing. Its complexity begins within its characters. It's an amazing work, everything I had hoped for."
"jlivesay2010","9","2","3","9 March 2009"," A really good movie
","I have to say this movie in a way is different than the other Rocky movies. I think that the antagonist Drago is the best out of all the antagonists. I like how he says hardly anything. All the actors especially Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire. But there are a few things that I have always wondered. Like is it possible for a guy like Rocky to beat a guy as big and strong as Drago and is it possible for the crowd to suddenly change there minds about who there cheering for. Also why is it that Mickey is never mentioned in the film. But over all it is a good movie. I would recommend this movie or any of the Rocky movies to anybody. I think the training montages get you fired up and everything else of this movie can to."
"jerekra","9","2","3","21 January 2009"," Odd At Parts, Great At Others.
","Let me start off by saying that I am amazed at how many people do not think this film is great. Hopefully reading this review will help you to see the film the way that I do, AS ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS EVER MADE!!!!! Russia decides to enter the boxing world. Ivan Drago, an enormous giant guy with super human strength not unlike He Man(the actor who played Drago also played He Man in ""Masters of the Universe""), is the guy the Russians hype up. Punching at extremely high power ""Whatever he hits he destroys"". Apollo gets upset at how the Russians think that they can box so he decides to go against Drago in an exhibition match. Rocky and Adrian both tell Apollo how he should think this decision out more but Apollo decides that he must do this. When Apollo and Drago fight it is a complete disaster and Drago kills Apollo, and I do not mean that Drago beats him bad I mean that he really KILLS HIM! Rocky decides to train over in Russia and then to go against Drago in the ring.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons that a movie is great is because of a great villain. Drago is truly a great villain. A boxer that kills somebody in the ring is really scary if you ask me. So the fact that Rocky is going against a guy who can kill you in the ring basically adds a lot more intrigue to this match up than some in the past. Drago is easily the best bad guy in the Rocky Series and one of the best bad guys ever if you ask me.<br/><br/>Rocky is a great character in this film. He is not as celebrity like as he was in Rocky 3, but he is not as street like as he was in the first two films. Basically his character in this film is a mature heavy weight champion getting near the end who knows how to handle things. Rocky does some of his best training ever in this film climbing mountains, chopping wood, lifting horse trailers, and doing excruciating looking sit ups. Rocky does not mess around training either and has no lapses like he did in previous films.<br/><br/>Apollo dying I think adds a lot to the story in this film. Rocky is fighting against Drago not for money, not for the heavy weight title, but to get revenge for his deceased friend and I think that is a lot more important than money or a title.<br/><br/>The music selection is awesome. ""Hearts on Fire"", ""Burning Heart"", and ""THeres No Easy Way Out"" are all played at great times and add to the film greatly. Vince Dicola was the composer of this film and this is the only Rocky film he is the composer for but his background music goes great with this film. Dicola also did the ""Transformers Animated Movie"" soundtrack and several of the songs sound similar. ""Gonna Fly Now"" is not used at all in this film but to tell you the truth the music was so good in this film that I did not care nor notice.<br/><br/>The final fight between Rocky and Drago is great. Not much more to add on that, you just need to see it.<br/><br/>There are a few issues I have with this film. Number one, what is the deal with the Robot that Rocky buys Paulie for his birthday? IT just seems out of place and really adds nothing to the film at all. Maybe they just wanted to add some science fiction but the Robot part at the beginning is just odd.<br/><br/>The ending is odd too. Rocky is going against Russia's number one boxer and at the beginning Rocky is booed mercilessly. Then towards the end of the fight the crowd starts cheering for ROcky????? That would never happen and given the circumstances I think this may be the most far fetched event in movie history.<br/><br/>Great Villain, great music, great plot, and overall just Great Rocky. Probably the third best of the series but still one of the greatest sporting movies ever. Highly recommended."

","Dolph Lundgren is the movie's new challenger, a robotic Russian who's got the punch that'll smash your car, nobody can surely stop this guy? As in any Rocky movie you won't find much originality, it's all about Rocky's personal problems as he once again faces the ultimate challenger. Rocky IV is even emptier than the third installment, there's nothing beneath the surface of Lundgren's ice-cold machine body as the movie speeds from the tragic death of Apollo Creed to Rocky's once again amazing achievement. The final boxing-match between Stallone and Lundgren is probably the series' most hard-knocking and action-packed, as usually blood will be spilled and eyes will start swelling, but this time you also get the feeling that Lundgren is actually a worthy companion to Rocky's never-ending victory spree. The most defining summary of Rocky IV would be something like this; crying, training, boxing, winning."
"KillerLord","9","2","3","3 February 2007"," A very intense Rocky movie!
","Rocky 4 is a surprisingly successful addition to the Rocky series. This movie is packed with much more action, emotion and a much brutal final match. Rocky 4 is about a Russian boxer Ivan Drago who ends up killing Apollo Creed in an exhibition match. Rocky, in a flurry of emotions, challenges Ivan himself. As per the conditions of the match, he is to fight the match in Russia. He even trains in Russia considering the distractions he could face back home.<br/><br/>We knew in Rocky 3 that in the end Rocky was going to end up on top and I am sure many of us also had the feeling that Rocky IV would also show him on top. The story is fairly simple. Just like unique training sequence, music and a different fighting method were major factors in helping Rocky 3 strike a chord with the fans of the franchise, similar was the case with Rocky IV. With not so deep a story to tell, Rocky IV needed something unique and powerful to carve a niche.<br/><br/>And that is precisely what Rocky IV was able to find. Rocky IV found Dolph Lundgren to play the Russian boxer Ivan Drago. And it showed a beautifully intense training sequence, a shocking first match and an inspiring second match. The scene of Apollo receiving the last punch of his life from Ivan Drago was one powerful scene that created a deep impact. The fear in the mind of Rocky as portrayed in his visions while driving back home was well done too. (""There's no easy Way out"" playing in the background.) Vince DiCola does a real good job with the music. The music he composed for the training sequence was really good. The training sequence itself was very good. The training shows Rocky use natural elements around him instead of sophisticated equipment (he is denied that anyway). The best part of the training scene is the huge difference between Drago's training and Rocky's training shown in parallel. It was a well done sequence.<br/><br/>The match was really well choreographed. Intense, bloody, brutal and nail-biting. And since the movie came out at a much later stage (it had to, after all it is the fourth movie) Stallone had these well-developed abs and chest and that helped in making the match and the training look much better. The match and the training did it again for this Rocky movie. Pretty sure if they had screwed up in these parts, the movie would never have become the box office success that it has become.<br/><br/>A must watch for all Rocky fans!"
"markshark_92","7","2","3","3 February 2007"," Storyline is only sub par, but action is great
","When I first got this movie, I expected something that was a chunk below the previous 3 and Rocky Balboa in quality. However, although it isn't quite my favorite (Rocky 2 would take 1st in my book), it still is definitely a very entertaining piece. I found it much easier to watch than the first movie, which seems to be more about character development and a bum walking around bouncing a ball than it does getting in the quick but satisfying action like Rocky 4 does. I actually think the death of Creed fit into the storyline well, and he always seemed more of a bloated pretty boy showman than a bloody and bruised brawler like Rocky. The training montages are pretty sweet, and for some reason, I really liked the scene where Rocky drives around in his car and recalls his past fights.<br/><br/>The one thing that really bugs me is ironically arguably the best part of the movie, the final fight with Drago. I'm not gonna get pissy with a movie because its fighting scenes aren't very realistic, but this was just... too fake. I was literally yelling at the t.v. for rocky 2 get his hand up and block his concrete face, but he's mastered the technique of letting a guy with one full ton of force per inch in his punches not phase him. I don't care how determined he was, I think it would have been better if Ivan somehow got dq'd so it'd at least be plausible. But that said, it's 2 bloody guys pounding each other, so it's still entertainment. A good movie."

","Wow! What a ride! The first time I saw this movie, I was probably 8 years old, and even now, at 16, I still am greatly entertained every time I watch this. Rocky is in the best shape of his life, and the training montages are exceptional. And I loved Dolph as Ivan Drago! He gave the character such intensity and almost an inhuman feel when he is seen coming into the arena for the final match. Rocky again has not only a huge, seemingly machine, opponent, he has an entire country booing his name. Rocky's great incentive to beat the almost unbeatable and overcome his own personal battles shines through in his fighting, making this, in my opinion, the best Rocky movie made."

","After seeing Rocky I, II and III, the fourth segment in the series must seem as a concept getting quite tired and running out of ideas. By this time, you will be able to effortlessly predict the results of the fights and the eventual outcome. Even so, Rocky IV proves to be an extremely enjoyable movie and in my opinion, by far the best movie from the Rocky series. Contributors to the quality of the movie include the song ""Living in America"" by James Brown and the good boxing effort by Dolph Ludgren. The writers have effectively utilized the cold war enmity to provide a somewhat provocative storyline, without actually vilifying the Russians at the same time. The ending in this movie, after the fight, was actually good."

As writer-director Stallone pulls off the successful formula as used in all the other Rockys as portraying his character as the underdog. And with the insane size of Lundgren and the fight he had with Apollo Creed (again you'll know what I mean if you've seen movie) it was another great underdog tail. Stallone does a well acted job and did not overact why he won a razzie will remain a mystery to the ends of time and he did a very good job as the director as well. Lundgren does a really good job as the erie intimidating and monstrous foreign boxer. Some may argue that he did a bad job cause he didn't talk much but his eyes oh man his eyes and facial expressions made him the perfect choice to portray Ivan Drago.

","I remember watching Rocky IV for the first time in my basement when i was about 13, alone. It was the feature showing for the late night movie loft.I begged my folks to let me stay up late and my mom had no problem. Immediatley, i was introduced to one of my favorite songs of all time when Survivors ""Eye of the Tiger"" played as Rocky koed Mr T in a flashback to Rocky III. Being 13 at the time, its easy to overlook unrealistic elements and predictable plot turns, thats why i had a great time with Rocky IV. Granted some of the dailogue is so insane and how in the world could Drago punch at 2000 psi! Cherrios for breakfast? more like bad screen writing. Putting that aside, what made Rocky IV so enjoyable for me was the great training montages, the in your face machoism, and when it came time for the final fight i was licking at the chops for Rocky to open up a can on Drago. I mean when ever im at the gym lifting weights i think of Rocky training in the Siberian wilderness (aka some place in Wyoming) and i really feel motivated. Now thats getting your price out of a movie! Upon recent viewings of the film in my late teens i could really see the flaws in Rocky IV. There is hardly an ounce of character devolpment and as i mentioned the absurd dailogue and unrealism. However, I still have a fun time with it and i owe it alot for the enjoyment it gave me when i was a kid. In fact i owe it a 9."

","The movie is great entertainment. I think it's the second best in the Rocky series. The First two were very good, but they were good for drama, and Rocky III and IV are entertaining, you have to forget about how old Rocky is. The movie is about his indomitable spirit, it's not about his anger. He lost A good friend. It is about revenge but it's not revenge in the heat of anger. That's what makes the movie is so good, while it may be unbelievable to most people it still is a great film."
"Lancer-7","10","2","3","19 April 1999"," The best one out of the 5!!!
","Rocky 4 was utterly spectacular. I know that the critics would say that Rocky 1 was the best, but for me I did not get nearly as much inspiration from the first one as I did in this film. This movie did such a marvelous job of depicting Drago as some omnipotent, unbeatable adversary. Throughout the movie I was left thinking, ..."" How the heck will Rocky beat this monster??""<br/><br/>Well... Rocky knew his challenge at hand and despite all the odds, (including that his best friend Apollo Creed got killed), was able to overcome them all. I thought that Drago clearly had all the advantages.. He was stronger (hitting 1850 psi with each punch!!!) , bigger, used steroids among other things. Rocky surely showed amazing perseverance to be able to come out on top.<br/><br/>I loved the training scenes. They portrayed another huge advantage the Russian had---training with computer technology. On the other hand, Rocky had only nature to assist him in his seemingly impossible challenge. This part of the movie beautifully depicted (more so than the other 4 movies), Rocky's seriousness for this battle. His stern disposition throughout and amazing feats such as climbing that tall mountain illustrate this fact.<br/><br/>And as for the final fight?? Man.. That was spectacular. Gotta see it to believe it. The biggest emotional ride I have ever had in a movie. This movie brought tears to my eyes as I can only sit and wonder.. ""How can someone be so extremely perseverant as Rocky Balboa was?"" This movie to me, is an icon of inspiration and espouses an unrelenting attitude to achieve any goal you have in life.<br/><br/>For these and many other reasons, Rocky 4 is probably my second favorite movie (A VERY, VERY CLOSE SECOND just behind Return of the Jedi) of all time. I must have seen this thing over 30 times.. minimum. I do not care if the critics thought this movie was lackluster compared to Rocky 1 and 2.... To me, this movie is a classic. Very close to being the best ever."

","Now I must admit to having initial misgivings to the fourth entry in the Rocky franchise but on repeated viewings it has greatly grown on me.<br/><br/>The film was made at the height of the Cold War and has an element of U.S.A. vs Soviet Union tensions demonstrated by James Brown singing Living In America!<br/><br/>The casting of Dolph Lundgren as Soviet Union nemesis Ivan Drago is a masterstroke as he looks like a machine and mumbles about twenty words of dialogue through the film.<br/><br/>He delivers some classic lines such as 'if he dies, he dies ' as he kills an old character from the series (spoiler).<br/><br/>The soundtrack is a great mid 1980s synthesizer filled delight. There are several great songs to accompany Rocky in some obligatory training montages in remote Russia (Canada).<br/><br/>At one point cash rich Rocky buys Paulie a robot.

","Magnificent campfest that could have just been an ugly McCarthyist flag waver but backs itself so hard that it becomes a delightful fantasia of masculine splendour.<br/><br/>There is basically no real conflict in the entire movie. There is just a sports game and some kind of principle and based on the premise of Rocky V it totally wasn't even worth it.<br/><br/>This indulges a fantasy of the perfect life but where there is still one more chance to sort of be a hero. There's no real stakes but the whole is realized with theatrical brilliance. The unsubtle dialogue, the vision of the Soviets as these unrelenting high tech machines going up against the wholesome, chopping wood, training style of the Italian American, the half-hearted interpersonal aspect that is resolved way too quickly (thank god) all make this a fun no brainer.<br/><br/>Basically it is a musical. There are some cracking tracks in this especially the amazing ""Hearts on Fire"" and so much prime montaging skills.<br/><br/>Rocky began as a sincere, kitchen-sink drama of an underdog just trying to go the distance. Now at part 4 it is basically pornography for us weedier guys who love seeing perfect specimens of males killing each other in the ring with a pseudo-patriotic twist."

"BandSAboutMovies","8","1","1","12 August 2019"," Montage city yet glorious
","Written by, directed by and starring Sylvester Stallone, this movie rode the crest of Reagan era jingoistic fervor to a $300 million dollar box office. The actual story is pretty much non-existent, as it only concerns two boxing matches and several montages. That said, it's the kind of movie that makes me want to scream my head off and cheer. In spite of how silly it all seems, it does it's job so very well.<br/><br/>Captain Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is the perfect Soviet athlete, more killing machine than boxer who has been trained to never lose. Along with a team of trainers, his Olympian swimmer wife Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen) and manager Nicolai Koloff (Michael Pataki!), his goal is to prove the supremacy of the Soviet athlete.<br/><br/>To do that, he wants a match with Rocky Balboa, but the champ doesn't want it. Instead, his former rival and best friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) takes the match, as much to prove to himself he can still fight as his patriotism is threatened by Russia's boasts.<br/><br/>Their fight is incredible. Drago simply walks to the ring while Apollo has live entrance music from James Brown, who tears through ""Living in America"" with a team of showgirls. Yet soon, the MGM Grand in Las Vegas is quieted as Drago absolutely tears Apollo apart. Rocky and Apollo's trainer Duke (Larry Burton, who was in Assault on Precinct 13 and played Larry Durkin, the garage owner in The Shining) beg their friend to throw in the towel, but he tells them to not stop the match no matter what. Drago hits him with one more punch that literally kills him, before he tells the assembled media, ""If he dies, he dies.""<br/><br/>Now Rocky wants that match. The Russians agree to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day (to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been getting in the U.S.), so Rocky tells his wife he must leave her behind. Now, it's all about the fight as he goes to Krasnogourbinsk with Duke and his brother-in-law Paulie (Burt Young, who of course I'll always love from Amityville II: The Possession).<br/><br/>The montage where Rocky trains in the snow while Drago works out in a high tech gym is the kind of thing that never happens in film any more. It's completely ridiculous, yet ai love every single minute of it. Drago is getting shot up with steroids while Rocky helps Russian farmers lift their sleds in the snow. It does bring a tear to one's eye.<br/><br/>Finally, we arrive at the big battle, with Rocky's wife Adrian (Talia Shire) even coming to Russia. Of course Rocky wins - ""He is not human. He is made of iron."" - but you knew that coming in. The end, with Rocky telling a crowd of Russians that he has won over that, ""If I can change, and you can change, then everybody can change!"" makes me jump up and down nearly thirty-five years after its release.<br/><br/>That fight scene at the end looks so good because, well, it's real. Or at least Stallone says they are. He wanted realism and Lundgren agreed that they would legitimately spar. One brutal punch to Stallone's chest later and his heart slammed against his breastbone and swelled up, sending him into intensive care for eight days. Lundgren also punched Carl Weathers so hard that he walked off the set and didn't return for four days.<br/><br/>While Rocky trained in a cabin (inspiring Olympians Michael Phelps and Ryan Locht), the high-tech equipment Drago uses is real and was around twenty years away from being publically used.<br/><br/>Speaking of high-tech, the real star of the film is SICO, the robot who played Paulie's gift. That scene - where he sings ""Happy birthday Paulie!"" - is perhaps one of my top ten moments in all cinema. It's so at odds with the rest of the movie that I can't help but love it. It actually is in there for a great reason, the International Robotics Inc. creation - featuring the voice of the company's CEO Robert Doornick - was written into the movie after it had been used to help treat Stallone's autistic son, Seargeoh.<br/><br/>Stallone's original plan was for Rocky V to be about the downward spiral that both Rocky and Drago would travel after this fight, with the Russian returning home in disgrace before becoming addicted to alcohol and steroids, then committing suicide. That never happened, although Creed II is all about the fight between Apollo and Drago's sons, with Lundgren returning to play his famous role.<br/><br/>The film won five Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone), Worst Director (Stallone), Worst Supporting Actress (Brigitte Nielsen), Worst New Star (Nielsen) and Worst Musical Score. It also received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Supporting Actress (Talia Shire), Worst Supporting Actor (Burt Young) and Worst Screenplay. I'm certain that Stallone wasn't concerned, what with this being the biggest performing sports film ever - until The Blind Side was released.<br/><br/>This movie was also part of a famous copyright lawsuit, Anderson v. Stallone. Timothy Anderson developed a treatment for Rocky IV on spec. After the studio didn't purchase it, the movie ended up very close to his treatment. The decision was that Anderson had ""prepared an unauthorized derivative work of the characters Stallone had developed in Rocky I through III, and thus he could not enforce his unauthorized story extension against the owner of the character's copyrights.""<br/><br/>There was even a special trailer made for this film with Drago telling the audience how he would defeat Rocky. If you don't want to watch this movie after this scene, I have no idea what is wrong with you."
"view_and_review","8","1","1","29 July 2019"," Fighting for America
","This was one prescient movie. A Russian heavyweight (see Klitschko brothers) and a Russian doping scandal (Russia was banned from the Olympics for state sponsored doping).<br/><br/>When Ivan Drago comes to America to fight against whoever the U.S. has to offer Apollo Creed is all to anxious to get into the ring. He is older, fiver years removed from boxing, and no longer on top but he can't help but challenge the Russian.<br/><br/>That was the fight before the fight. Every Rocky movie has the fight before the fight: a fight against self, a fight against doubt, a fight against family--something. In this part Apollo had to fight against those who were telling him it wasn't worth it. Once Apollo was killed in the ring by the hulking Drago, Rocky had to fight against the objections of his wife, Adrian.<br/><br/>There was no deterring Rocky from fighting Drago. He was fighting for Apollo Creed, he was fighting for America. For me, this was one of, if not the most patriotic movies I've ever watched. They made the Russians such monsters that I was rooting for Rocky like I'd root for my favorite sports team. I was all in. I was emotionally invested in seeing Rocky destroy the Russian.<br/><br/>Rocky IV, I think, was a bounce back movie. One was a classic, two was good, three fell off IMO, and four was a reclamation of greatness. That's a rare feat that probably has not been accomplished in film. Usually, if a third movie is a stinker there is no fourth, or if there is a fourth it's just as bad if not worse. Rocky IV is the most memorable Rocky for me after the first."

","The rocky series is one of movie history's greatest successes. That is until Rocky V and beyond! Some people will disagree of course. The first was groundbreaking. The second was the rematch!
But you know people change.
You build a relationship with the characters, which is easy to do because they're all kind of down on there luck normal folk. The movies progress with the build up of the relationship between Apollo and Rock through 1 into 2, not so much 3 with Clubber Lang who's prediction for the fight was pain. The only thing painful was the movie Rocky 3.
Alas Rocky IV and the Cold War!
Rocky's nemesis turned best pal has been beaten to a pulp and Rock can't take it.
Q emotional turmoil, amazing training montage in the wilderness with a superb soundtrack to boot.
Rock wants a piece of the almost cyborg Russian, which leads to his best fight in the movies to date, by a long chalk!!!

"Hey_Sweden","7","1","1","1 February 2019"," There's no easy way out. There's no shortcut home.
","Rocky Balboa (Sly Stallone) is once again doing what he does best, and this time there's more at stake in the grand scheme of things. He's set to fight an imposing, superhuman Russian (Dolph Lundgren, in his big breakthrough role), all in the name of avenging a friends' untimely death and fighting for the greater glory of the U.S. of A.<br/><br/>The formula in these films still works wonders, with Sly in fine form. He's as affable as he's ever been, and functioning as writer, director & star, he came up with an effectively simple, straightforward story. There's no deep thinking with an audience-pleaser like this one, you just go with the good vibes and are more than willing to root for the underdog for another round. Many of Rocky's friends and family have their doubts as to how well he'll fare against a monster like Lundgren, but as he sees it, THIS is what Rocky does. He's damn good at it, and by God, he's going to persevere.<br/><br/>Sly does know just how to push our buttons, and does it with style. A fair bit of the running time here is devoted to montage; the best one showcases the contrasting methods of training for Sly and Lundgren. The latter has all manner of technology available to him, while Rocky goes completely old-school. And even with all the montage, this may be the shortest Rocky film to date at just an hour and 32 minutes.<br/><br/>Rocky's support system - wife Adrian (Talia Shire, looking the best she's looked in this series), comedy relief brother in law Paulie (Burt Young), corner man Duke (Tony Burton) - continue to supply goodwill for the viewers. Lundgren is a true physical specimen as the cold-blooded villain, even if he doesn't have much of a character to play. Brigitte Nielsen is adequate as his wife. Michael Pataki is good as a Russian braggart. But it's Carl Weathers as Apollo who gives the best performance; Apollo is out to prove to himself and to others that he's NOT over the hill and still has plenty of fight in him.<br/><br/>The rousing rock & pop soundtrack and Vince DiColas' score do help to get you in a fired-up mood. And the editing (by John W. Wheeler and Don Zimmerman) is first-rate.<br/><br/>Good fun for series fans.<br/><br/>However: the less said about the robot, the better.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"Caleb_Everett","9","1","1","2 January 2019"," Favorite Boxing Movie.
","The opening shot of the two boxing gloves exploding is the worst part of this movie, well that and the stupid robot, after that it's pure GOLD. Dolph Lundgren is definitely the greatest opponent that Rocky has faced, he's a cold-blooded punch throwing machine. I love that Drago spends a majority of the movie as a silent antagonist to Rocky's more outspoken protagonist. Rocky IV is a far step from the original Rocky, this adventure feels far more like a modern sports film rather than a gritty story that Rocky I & II offered. It's a fun, fast, testosterone boosted thrill-ride."

"KeremUlucay","7","1","1","30 December 2018"," NOT AS GOOD AS FIRST TRILOGY
","Rocky IV is not as good as first trilogy because there are a lot of sequences that we got used to see. Why Apollo wants this match so much? He has already retired. There must be new ones to represent America. And he died! What the hell? This is not realistic and unfortunately it cant be so dramatic because it is ridiculous. Im sad about that. In first 3 movies, Apollo has written so well but in fourth one, he is nothing. Rocky's motivation is not Apollo's death either. He didnt even say anything about him after fight. But I must say something, even this movie hasnt got an intense main idea, final sequence has it. Even though we saw lots of unnecessary propagandas during the film, what Rocky said about politics and people were awesome. Also Rocky proved us something else. This sport is not just physical. Everyone is just human. If anyone want to get a victory, they have to be mentally strong. Sylvester Stallone does this alright in every movie; showing us ""Who is Rocky?"" actually. Why this character is amazing and he inspires people so much."
"davidtkd-25249","9","1","1","4 January 2018"," Rocky IV (1985): The Winner and Still Champ
","Rocky IV (1985) is an American sports drama film starring Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Brigitte Nielsen, and Dolph Lundgren. The film is written by and directed by Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>ROCKY IV was the first and only film in the Rocky franchise not to have the classic side-scrolling screen intro. Instead, the intro has two boxing gloves, one representing the USA and the other representing the USSR (SOVIET UNION). Both gloves smash into each other and explode while Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" is playing. <br/><br/>The film starts up with the ""flashback"" scene that shows the events from the end of the previous installment in the franchise ROCKY III (1982). It shows the Heavyweight Championship Rematch Title Fight between southpaw Rocky Balboa and the reigning Heavyweight Champion of the World James ""Clubber"" Lang. Rocky ends up KO'ing Clubber in the 3rd round. Rocky is crowned for the second and final time the NEW HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION OF THE WORLD. Rocky owes Creed a favor and they spar each other in Mickey's gym.<br/><br/>After the flashback of ROCKY III, we are now ready to dive into the beginning of ROCKY IV. The national amateur boxing champion of the USSR Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) along with his gold medal olympic swimming wife Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen) arrive from the USSR and come to the USA to challenge the Heavyweight Champion of the World Rocky ""The Italian Stallion"" Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) to a boxing match. However, Rocky's former rival, former Heavyweight Champion of the World, and a long-time friend Apollo ""The Master of Disaster"" Creed (Carl Weathers) challenges Drago to an exhibition bout instead. Rocky is hesitant due to the fact that Apollo Creed has been retired for over five years. Apollo, as cocky as he was in the original ROCKY, believes he can beat this ""chump"" easy. The fight takes place in California and is billed ""SUPERMAN vs. SUPERHYPE"". Ivan Drago fights Apollo Creed. The first round has Drago relentlessly beating Creed to a pulp. In the second round, Apollo is nearly destroyed when Tony ""Duke"" Evers (Tony Burton) encourages Rocky to throw in the towel and stop the fight. With the final blow, Drago brutally murders Apollo Creed in the ring. <br/><br/>This fight causes much controversy and negative attention towards Ivan Drago. 
Rocky decides to fight the 2,000 PSI fighter in the ring in Moscow, Russia, USSR to avenge Apollo's death. The fight is set December 25th. Rocky will make no money whatsoever from this fight as to him it is not about the money. Rocky has to temporary give up his title in order to fight Drago due to the fact that the Boxing Commission does not approve of this fight because of Apollo's death. <br/><br/>Rocky goes to train in Russia, where his wife, Adrian (Talia Shire), his friend and Adrian's sister Paulie (Burt Young), and Tony join him. Rocky relentlessly trains for this fight. He trains the hardest he has ever in his life, even more than his fight against Clubber Lang. <br/><br/>The fight takes place. The athletes go back and forth. The fight is a very close one. It is the fifteenth round. Rocky knocks Drago down and wins the fight. There is overjoy for Rocky Balboa. He gives a speech on changing stating that everyone can change. The movie ends with Rocky waving the American flag in the air and rejoicing over the result of the fight. <br/><br/>ROCKY IV, at 91 minutes, is the shortest film in the whole franchise, and it shows that a lot. The pacing feels a little bit rushed. Not a terrible thing though. I just wished the film was a little bit longer. <br/><br/>ROCKY IV marks Stallone's third film that he directed n the series after ROCKY II (1979), and ROCKY III (1982). Sylvester Stallone would go on to direct ROCKY BALBOA (2006). <br/><br/>ROCKY IV was made on a budget of $30,000,000. The film grossed $300,000,000, making it the most successful film in the entire franchise and the highest grossing boxing film of all-time.<br/><br/>ROCKY IV features John Cafferty's ""Hearts On Fire"" which is a huge hit song. Bill Conti, who composed the music for ROCKY, ROCKY II, and ROCKY III, could not return to compose the music for ROCKY IV due to the fact that he was too busy working on the music for THE KARATE KID (1984) and The Karate Kid Part II (1986). Sylvester Stallone hired Vince DiCola to compose the music for the film. Vince DiCola won a Razzie Award for Worst Film Score. However, I think that that is absolute crap considering how great the film score is and how much popularity his score for the film has had. I still like Bill Conti's score more however. You do see brief notes of Bill Conti's score in the film but not much. <br/><br/>ROCKY IV, while lacking a lot of plot and being more a revenge story than an underdog story that the first 3 movies were, ROCKY IV is still an incredibly enjoyable film and just as good as ROCKY III in some ways. <br/><br/>9/10"

One could consider it as possibly the weakest movie of the Rocky movie franchise then until the fifth Rocky or Rocky V was made because of it.<br/><br/>But nevertheless,I think that it remains enjoyable,fun and entertaining especially if one is not to expect a classic or a masterpiece like Rocky I and Rocky II or probably for some,Creed.Added to that,it a good movie to watch before watching Creed II considering that it was reported while this review is written that Dolph Lundgren will reprise his role of Ivan Drago in it.That second Creed movie has a good prequel in Rocky IV."

It may have been a slight disappointment at the time, but it wasn't that bad. Especially when you consider that the utterly atrocious Rocky V didn't win any Razzies.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is entertaining and takes the series in a new direction, even if parts of it do recall the earlier films."

","Rocky IV should be titled ROCKY THE AVENGER.It's themes are simply technology VS human achievement Man VS machine. And the main theme politics/ Or Rather us VS Them. The USA VS Russia. Stallone as gifted a writer as always writes a compelling story. About the three themes and adds a fourth. what happens to the old warriors ? The old Champions ? where do they go after the fight is over ? To me Rocky IV is a mixed bag. A great movie to watch nicely packaged and done with style. but it's also the one that Takes Rocky the furthest away from the core of what Rocky is.<br/><br/>When the Russians toss their hat into the boxing ring The world takes notice they even offer to challenge Rocky to a exhibition bout but Rocky declines. Apollo Creed however has his own ideas about that. five years retired. Apollo misses the spotlight the adoration of the crowds. Apollo feels old out of date and worse of all he feels forgotten. Ivan Drago is the Russian Boxing Champion. he's huge strong and a walking billboard for better health thru science. The two men could not be further apart. The Russians are looking for a top contender. And Apollo asks Rocky to help him. ""Please Rocky I'm asking you as a friend. Please stand by me one more time."" Rocky agree to train Apollo. the fight becomes a bloodbath and Apollo is killed in the ring. after the Russians are leaving the USA. And Rocky has challenged Drago the Russians agree except the match Must be held in Russia. Rocky has a fight with Adrian. She tells him he can't win. Rocky just can't turn his back on this. He had watched his best friend get murdered by a Russian killing machine. And Rocky has a desire to bring him down. Stallone once said that he ran out of ideas for the movie that explains the long training scenes.<br/><br/>The fight itself is Very good as Rocky battles Drago. a Modern David VS Goliath match. Rocky wins the big match. And the end speech is right out of the 80's when Hollywood felt they had to get political every now and then. Not bad as far as entertainment goes and I find myself still watching it even after all theses years. the Worst in the Rocky series. but still overall on it's own a damn good movie."
"vav-61764","7","1","1","2 December 2015"," Rocky IV is Very Enjoyable, but Some Changes and Excesses Damaged the Picture
","One of the major differences from its predecessors, the reasons for the fight are much more emotional and difficult. Dolph Lundgren is amazing being Drago, he's a man of few words, but passes the idea of being a very dangerous guy in the ring. Even if it's more focused on the fight, the plot also has a good character development and give a greater importance to Rocky and his family than Rocky III. Along with the fact that is much more humorous, largely due to Paulie, as he left his sentimental side appear and provided some good and funny scenes, he managed to decrease the tension that grows throughout the story. The friendship between Rocky and Apollo Creed is one of the hits as each one has a different view about the arrival of the old age, one who sees no problem about settling down and the other who always wants to be the showman. A significant change was made in the soundtrack, it becomes not as good as before and sometimes the soundtrack doesn't fit very well with the scene. Besides having the excessive use of video clips with fighters preparing for the ultimate battle. Bill Butler, director of photography, even though are just some few, was able to make some beautiful takes from the landscapes of Russia."
"intothedrunk","9","1","1","22 November 2015"," Reliant on the Entertainment Value
","Various people have their opinions on which movie Stallone should have stopped at. In my opinion, this should have been the final installment in the Rocky trilogy. <br/><br/>I have taken a star out of it because of the realism of the scenes. The thought of Soviet citizens chanting ""ROCKY"" in 1985 is hard to believe and Lundgren was much taller than Stallone.<br/><br/>If you focus too much on how real things should have been or if there is too much emphasis on politics, then you won't enjoy the movie too much. The same applies if you have a negative view of Stallone. You either like his movies, tolerate them or hate them.<br/><br/>Although you can't compare this to the first movie or even the following two sequels, ""Rocky IV"" is quintessentially a 1980s action film. It has the typical good guys/bad guys theme and obviously the viewers should chant for the ""good guys"". Although the powerful Ivan Drago is meant to destroy Rocky, Balboa unintentionally shows that you don't need drugs to succeed and if you have great mental strength, you can battle through anything. I'll reiterate this concept is more for the sake of entertainment than realism.<br/><br/>What is often not given enough credit is the performance of Burt Young as Paulie. Putting the obscure relationship with his robot aside, ""Rocky IV"" features Paulie at his most humorous and most brutally honest. This is best summed-up when Paulie, Duke and Rocky arrive in the USSR and Paulie says that their cabin is ""below the human standard"". <br/><br/>The Rocky movies are the type of films that make you want to cheer for the underdog and this is no different. After all the adrenalin of the fight in the USSR, this should have been the right way to end the Rocky saga. Rocky V and Rocky Balboa weren't really worth making."

","The fourth installment of Rocky provides unusual themes from the first three films such as the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union,American patriotism and revenge towards the death of a friend.This time around,star/writer/director Sylvester Stallone puts them all together in Rocky IV.The movie stars Stallone together with Talia Shire,Burt Young,Carl Weathers,Tony Burton - all whom have reprise their roles,together with Dolph Lundgren as Rocky's new opponent,Ivan Drago and Brigette Nielsen as Drago's wife.<br/><br/>Rocky IV has the story this time with Rocky Balboa,the heavyweight champion of the world.Also,he is now a good friend of his one-time nemesis, Apollo Creed.Rocky Balboa plans to retire from boxing after regaining his title from Clubber Lang.Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself,Creed challenges Ivan Drago,an unknown amateur boxer from the Soviet Union who wants to make a bid to enter professional boxing to an exhibition bout. During the ensuing press conference, Apollo is accused of being a ""has been"" by Drago's manager. Livid, Apollo loses his temper, and a mêlée ensues. It is broken up and Apollo leaves the press conference abruptly vowing to ""finish this in the ring"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately,Apollo Creed is brutally slaughtered in the boxing ring during a lop-sided exhibition match against the Russian,an event that Rocky takes personally. Vowing revenge against Drago in the name of Creed and the United States, Rocky is invited to the Soviet Union for a match-up and hires Creed's former manager to get him in shape. While Drago trains using the latest technology,Rocky's ascetic preparations are a low-key affair of carrying logs up hills through knee-deep Russian snow.As everyone knew,the end of the movie has Rocky winning the match.<br/><br/>I consider Rocky IV definitely is considered has the most action-packed as compared to the first three films.Aside from that,it is enjoyable and entertaining in the sense the American patriotism was brought into the picture as one of its themes.Unfortunately,it has become shallow just and has leveled itself with Rambo,the other movie franchise of Stallone.It was also in this movie wherein Rocky has lost its punch and character development were set aside especially when a robot-like opponent was presented and revenge for a death of a friend was brought into the story.<br/><br/>Despite of its commercial success at the box office,I consider it the second worst Rocky installments behind Rocky,Rocky Balboa,Rocky II and Rocky III in that order."

","Subtlety and plausibility are entirely absent here, but to me this film remains the most entertaining in the ""Rocky"" series.  Whether it be the death of Apollo Creed in the exhibition match, the training sequence filled with great music, or the climactic final fight, the film is unashamedly bombastic and carries me through its running time on a tide of euphoria that makes me ignore the silliness of it all.  Dolph Lundgren makes a great villain, and it's only the final five minutes of breast-beating from one of ""America's favourite fictional sons"" - TM - that becomes almost too hard to take.  The very idea that a hostile Russian crowd could be won over by someone showing a little guts is preposterous.  Much like the whole movie, in fact; but I don't care, I like it!"

","Sylvester Stallone returns as Rocky Balboa the prize fighter who this time takes on a Soviet superman named Ivan Drago(Dolph Lundgren) who punches really hard, seems Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) made a very stupid move and picked the wrong opponent to come out of retirement to fight because Drago destroys him (Literally) and Rocky trains to get even for this deed. Rocky IV is in my opinion the lamest sequel of the series, mainly because it is so absurd, jingoistic and really stupid. For instance Rocky has gone from being about a movie about regular people into a tale about vengeance and patriotic glory of socking the Soviet union around. Even worse is how Stallone than tries to eat his cake too by providing a speech about how we can all be friends. This just makes one want to throw up at just how mind numbingly syrupy the sequence is. Also of note is how disappointing Dolph Lundgren is as a villain. I like Dolph Lundgren and to his credit his performance is probably the most credible since he was the only main character NOT nominated for a Razzie for ""Worst Actor"" but that being said he isn't as fun as Mr. T was and his villain while quite opposing is lost in translation due to the fact that Brigette Neilsen speaks for him. Of course only in a movie with actors like Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Carl Weathers and Michael Patakai can Brigette Neilsen end up making those actors seem like Oscar caliber actors. Neilsen is a useless character and for one was hoping Dolph Lundgren would use one of his 2000 pound punches to knock her dead.<br/><br/>* out of 4-(Bad)"

The big question in this movie is why does Rocky risk his health and the few brain cells he has left to try and challenge a genetic freak like Drago. By this time in the franchise Rocky has more guts than brains (a lot more). If I was Rocky's wife I would've put him in a sanatorium (didn't he see what Drago did to his friend and punchy buddy Apollo Creed?)<br/><br/>Recommended for a few laughs if nothing else.<br/><br/>B-<br/><br/>P.S.

","You know, I never really understood Rocky (7) when I was younger. I liked it, but I didn't really understand it. I didn't get that two men who go fifteen rounds without blocking a single punch aren't good boxers and would be brain damaged after one fight. I also didn't get that in the low-grade sanitised Scorcese streets of Rocky's neighbourhood that his friend Paulie using the word ""freakin'"" is not an expletive, more a way to ensure a PG certificate. I never got that Adrian had a man's name. I never got that the time allotted for Rocky to compete with the heavyweight champion of the world  five weeks  is an extremely unlikely premise. I mean, never mind Apollo Creed, even if the champ was Frank Bruno you'd need longer than five weeks. Most importantly, I never realised that Rocky actually loses, a grain of realism that would thereafter be abandoned.<br/><br/>Rocky II (6) is essentially Rocky with whistles and bells, while Rocky III (5) gave us a softened champ in the shortest of the franchise. The only Rocky film of the 90s, and, to date, the final instalment, Rocky V (4) gives Talia Shire and Burt Young get a little more to do than usual; Talia doing her narrative requirement of shouting ""Rocky"" at vital fight moments, thus causing the brain damaged Rocky's Palovian winning reaction. Rather like The Rolling Stones continuing to tour, this film, while vaguely entertaining, is a rather sad parody of it's former self.<br/><br/>Then there was Rocky IV. If you thought that Rocky III's ""losing in yellow, triumphing when wearing the American flag"" was unsubtle, then Rocky IV proved that we hadn't seen nuthin'. Paulie is underused comic foil; pratt falling in snow and playing with his six-foot robot, while Adrian is virtually absent and James Brown puts in an appearance. A horrifically bad sequel, its runtime is played out with a series of images set to tacky 80s MOR white rock. One of these overwrought pop videos even has Rocky's life, in the form of clips from the series, run before his eyes. Survivor's Eye of the Tiger is now the opening theme, the old Rocky brass fanfare abandoned, while characterisation is minimal. It's unsettling how perfunctory the personal scenes now are. Whereas the first was about Rocky and Adrian, the fight almost incidental, by this time the fight was the whole film, the personal conflicts just an inconvenience to be got out of the way. Stallone, writer of all five movies, fails to realise that without these conflicts, the fights themselves lack any form of emotional resonance. What little dialogue this one has is absolutely abominable, all ""souls"" and ""hearts"" and Rocky's opponent claiming ""He's not human. He is like a piece of iron"". Rocky's opponent is Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lungren after jettisoning all charisma reserves. Drago is the product of steroids and artificial environments. Rocky, meanwhile, travels to Russia to fight him, using natural methods to train. So we see Rocky's nature juxtaposed against Drago's mechanical, clinical training; including Rocky felling a tree as Drago fells a sparring partner. Err is this supposed to be symbolic? I couldn't be sure, it was too subtle.<br/><br/>In the film's favour, Raging Bull's influence does seem to have finally caught up with the franchise, with blood spurts now a semi-regular feature of the bouts. In fact, while the melon crushing sound effects have got so extreme they're laughable, the initial match between Drago and Apollo Creed is the most viscous fight of the series. It's notable that Rocky's opponents are always, by design of the limited filmmaking scope, one-dimensional bad guys. Apollo only got an extra dimension when he crossed over to the ""good guys"" in Rocky III. Not that such badly drawn characters make a difference when you give a great performance like Mr. T. But Lungren practically falls off the screen in apathy, while Stallone's interest in the film and the character he plays has long since deserted him. Look at the scene where he stares down Drago after his match with Apollo. What is supposed to be hate in Rocky's eyes is merely indifference. The character of Rocky, too, has become a dull preacher, with little or none of the traits that first made him so endearing. It's stunning that the minor classic Rocky could become the minor turkey Rocky IV.<br/><br/>Drago's menace is built up largely through persuasion. Never mind that he's what seems a foot and a half taller than Rocky, we're told that the average boxer can punch an average weight of 700 pounds. Drago manages 2150. So that when one of his punches lands  and land they frequently do  we get to feel it all the more. As the climatic fight draws towards a close, the stereotyped, cold, clinical Russian crowd  none of whom are shown to speak English  suddenly erupt into a chant of ""Rocky, Rocky"". At the end of the fight, Rocky takes the mike, something he had no interest in for the first film. Here he gets on his soapbox. We learn that the fight has been about two men killing each other, but it's got to be better than 20 million doing the same thing. You know, It's suddenly dawned on me! The whole film was a thinly veiled commentary on the cold war between America and Russia! Thank goodness Sylvester thought to write a speech explaining this element, it might have been lost on me otherwise, as discrete as it was. ""If I can change,"" he bawls, ""then you can change. Everybody can change"". The crowd erupts! A bloke that's supposed to be Gorbachev gets up and applauds. My God, while a pile of absolute tripe. Such naive, unsophisticated, lowbrow mush that has the audacity to think it's a political satire. Yet the film's strength is that it's so bad, so mindboggling awful that it becomes fantastically silly entertainment. So silly, in fact, that it elevates a terrible film to a 4."
"cem92003","3","4","10","6 July 2007"," Fine sample of cerebral hepatitis
","This film is simply hilarious. And one of the most idiotic and ridiculous part belongs to the sequence of scenes depicting the training of both adversaries in Soviet Union (SU). While Rocky is training under rather hard and stringent conditions- using natural training outlets such as pulling a chart on skis ,Drago on the other hand, uses the most sophisticated training equipments. This seems to be in stark contrast to the reality ;please remember the Chernobyl incident v.s Three Miles İsland case where USA got away better than SU, recall the movie title ""K-19 The Widow Maker"". The collapse of the Soviet empire revealed who was the weaker one in the armament's race, space race and other high-tech superiority showdown. Still, Hollywood filmmakers has the moronic ability to swap roles when the American hero is confronted with a rival either from East bloc or third world and to assign under advantaged role to our hero. The rivals' superiority could be tolerated in a science-fiction movie, where the aliens are expected to have access to superior technology. But why Rocky should be the underdog instead of being given at least equal chances of training as Drago?At least, why not to stay in the USA during the training instead of coming to Russia only to endure unnecessary hardship? During the fighting scenes sometimes the punches become so loud that one may think someone is hitting a car's trunk with a sledgehammer. You don't need a Superman or Captain America or Hulk here; just look at our hero who, after having received at least 20 -25 punches enough to kill an elephant, still comes victorious and moreover has the ability to deliver quite an erudite speech at the end of the fight. Given the physical advantage of Dolph Lundgren who stood almost 20 cm taller and much more muscular than Rocky, the audience quickly empathizes with the underdog of course ( Americans have always been the underdog when for example they bombed Iraq to defend themselves against the terrible, terrible weapons of mass destruction of Saddam, which were nowhere to be found).<br/><br/>While Brigitte Nielsen successfully portrays the cold, supremacist blonde which would make her an ideal candidate to star as an Amazon woman, Talia Shire seems to have stuck to her whining, weak and vacillating impersonation since Godfather. Well, you don't need to be a femdom worshiper to be disgusted with that weeping woman.<br/><br/>This is a kind of movie cut out for those who prefer fast-food to a gourmet dish in a fancy restaurant.

"Maziun","6","3","7","23 February 2014"," Incredibly entertaining silly fun
","The plot of Rocky IV"" is very simple. It's basically the same plot as in ""Rocky 3"" with small changes (Apollo instead of Mick , Ivan Drago instead of Clubber Lang). Unlike other movies in the series ""Rocky IV"" isn't a sport drama – it's too silly for that , too cheesy to take itself seriously. It's more of an unusual action movie with boxing in it. It's more like ""Commando"" than original ""Rocky"" . If you're ready to accept it , prepare yourself for fun. The movie was a huge success – ""Rocky IV"" was the highest grossing film in the Rocky series, taking some $300 million worldwide. After watching the movie it's not strange to see why. It's a product of it's times , but still very entertaining today.<br/><br/>Yes , the Russians are portrayed stereotypical here and in reality, Soviet Heavyweights were not allowed to box professional fighters during the Cold War , but who really cares (except for Russians of course). ""Rocky IV"" is largely a metaphor for the tensions between America and Russia which existed in the Cold War. Drago is Soviet Union – stronger and cruel , while Balboa is America – weaker, but with more heart and stamina. The famous line ""it's better to watch two people trying to kill each other than twenty millions"" actually has meaning here. Communist and Nazis did use the sports for their propaganda and very often in real life politics and sport were entwined. ""Rocky IV"" has a strong anti-communist message, which I appreciate unlike other viewers. Communism was a terrifying system that treated people like puppets for the needs of communist party (Drago here is no exception). ""Rocky IV"" also has got a simple , but honest (at least to me ) message that people should look past their political beliefs and try to find peace on Earth. There is also some interesting commentary here on man vs machine and dehumanization of society because of technology (Paulie's robot).<br/><br/>The movie is far from being realistic , but I have to defend it a little. First of all it IS possible for a boxer to die during boxing match ( Benny Paret vs Emile Griffith in 1962) . Second , it is possible for a crowd to cheer for the opponent when he wins their respect ( in football/soccer when a player of the opposite team shoot 4 goals in one match the crowd gave him a standing ovation). Third , Rocky's unconventional techniques have a logic behind them. Rocky isn't using technology or steroids , because he doesn't think that's honorable . He makes it harder for himself intentionally and he succeeds . It's not the technology and money , but heart and talent what really count. The training sequences are top notch , great to watch and inspiring. The training techniques and technology that Drago has in this movie were considered science fiction in 1985 , but now they are a standard . And it's true that in communist countries steroids were often used.<br/><br/>Stallone was in great physical shape in 1985 as he made both ""Rambo 2"" and ""Rocky 4"". That's all you remember from his performance . Talia Shire , Carl Weathers and Burt Young gave good performances as their repeated their roles from previous movies. Brigitte Nielsen (Stallone's future wife) is OK as the wife of Drago. The real star here is however Dolph Lundgren (""The Punisher"") as Ivan Drago. He was a perfect choice. His physically incredibly intimidating and definitely one of greatest cinema villains.<br/><br/>This is the only Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. James Brown ""Living in America"" , Robert Trepper ""No easy way out"" ( one of the best montage songs ever ) , Survivor "" Burning heart"" , John Cafferty ""Hearts on fire"" – the soundtrack here is just fantastic. Stallone's makes a great use of the songs and Vince DiCola's music (""Training montage"" is incredibly catchy) . He shows a talent worthy of great music video director here. When the music appears it's incredibly inspiring and powerful. The fights scenes are appropriately brutal and unrealistic , but that's what they are so fun. It's an ultimate David versus Goliat fight.<br/><br/>The movie is full of memorable , if not silly dialogues and one liners. Who could forget ""If I can change , then you can change then everybody can change"" . Other famous lines : ""If he dies, he dies"" , ""Hit the one in the middle"" , ""I will break you"". The ""hit the one in the middle"" exchange, actually did happen in real life fight during the Max Baer-Max Schmeling heavyweight fight in June 1933 .<br/><br/>It's definitely a classic movie and a symbol of the 80's – over the top , but wonderfully entertaining. If I had to rate it for it's pure entertainment value I would give it 10/10. However since this is an odd entry in a solid series of sport dramas I give it 6/10."

","After iron man Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a highly intimidating 6-foot-5, 261-pound Soviet athlete, kills Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) in an exhibition match, Rocky comes to the heart of Russia for fifteen pile-driving boxing rounds of revenge.<br/><br/>This is one of the shortest entries in the series. Cutting off the scenes added from part three, this is really only about 80 minutes. This is also the silliest up to this point; while Rocky seems a little less stupid, a robot is added to the family. A robot? Not that this is a bad movie, but it is a little light in the plot (even for a ""Rocky"" film) and seems to have been made purely to cash in on Cold War fervor. Strangely, despite that, it ages rather well and now becomes a bizarre nostalgia piece."

","Probably my favorite Rocky movie behind the original and easily the one I've re-watched the most. It's just sheer '80s goodness that perhaps can only best be appreciated by a child of that decade. The story this time has the Russians introducing a new fighter, drug-enhanced giant Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), to challenge Rocky. But instead of Rocky, they get Apollo. After Drago kills Apollo in what was supposed to be an exhibition match, Rocky travels to Russia to avenge his friend in a match televised across the world on Christmas.<br/><br/>Such a fun movie with great characters, memorable lines, and wonderful scenes. Sylvester Stallone stars, as well as writing and directing. Carl Weathers, Talia Shire, and Burt Young all return. All are great. Career-defining role for Dolph Lundgren. Brigitte Nielsen is good as his wife (she would marry Stallone the same year this was released). Vince DiCola steps in to do the score this time and does an excellent job, along with a fantastic soundtrack featuring James Brown, John Cafferty, and Robert Tepper, among others. The fight scenes are among the best of the series. Also some of the best montages you'll ever see. A fantastic fist-pumper of a movie with action, drama, humor, tragedy, and thought-provoking ideas about world peace. Okay, that last part was a stretch but I'm not someone who rolls their eyes at '80s Cold War movies -- I love 'em! Really a terrific piece of entertainment. Nowhere near the artistry of the first film but much more enjoyable than any others in the series."

","Rocky IV and V are two of the most hated Rocky movies. I can see why. Rocky IV is more of a cartoon and V was more of a money grabber. But since we get the same cast members playing our favourite boxing crew, nothing can go terribly wrong.<br/><br/>Rocky is semi-retired and is challenged in an exhibition match against Russia's super boxer, Ivan Drago (Lundgren). Before Rocky makes up his mind, his bored and retired buddy, Apollo Creed steps out of retirement and challenges Drago himself. Creed underestimates Drago and is killed before the end of the second round. I've always been sour with Apollo getting killed by Drago that easily. I know that Rocky wanted another reason to fight, but his death was so sudden that it was a bit unrealistic. Rocky accepts Drago's challenge and goes to Russia to avenge his friend's death. Of course, Rocky wins. But given Apollo's death, Rocky's victory, and Drago, there's no way Rocky could have won. Drago abuses steroids and becomes way more powerful than he was when he fought Apollo, but Rocky is literally half his size! The training sequences show that Rocky does stand a chance of living, with really cool music playing and that adds to the fun and cheesiness. I know that Rocky was a lot more prepared than Apollo, but Rocky gets brutally hit hundreds of times and gets knocked down many times throughout the match, but still wins! Drago gets knocked down once and that's the end. That little bit is unrealistic. It is a revenge match where the good guy must triumph by the end; even if that means making everything unrealistic. Luckily, the fight is one of, if not, the best in the series."

","No complaints here Sly. Masterpiece. But I still felt that the ending fight was too short and I didn't like the editing of the fight. A more extended fight sequence would have been preferable.<br/><br/>Great music and great action. Commendable acting by supporting actors and actresses namely Carl Weathers, Burt young, Talia Shire, Bridgette Neilson, Michael Pataki and Tony Burton. <br/><br/>Dolph Lundgren is absolutely phenomenal as the Russsian Boxer Ivan Drago and I think should have been given an Oscar for his performance.<br/><br/>Stallone looks more physically built up than we saw him earlier in Rocky 3. The fight at the end of the film is not that pacey as the one we saw in Rocky 3 against Mr. T.<br/><br/>The great blockbuster music is the highlight. ""Hearts On Fire"" by John Cafferty and ""No Easy Way Out"" by Robert Tepper are the best ones.<br/><br/>The training sequences showing both Rocky's and Drago's at the same time was Sly's genius. <br/><br/>The best dialogue in the film was when Rocky tells his some that ""when you can go one more round when you don't think you can makes all the difference in your life"". Yes this is VERY true.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Russian Boxer Ivan Drago wants a match against Rocky. Apollo Creed sees this as another opportunity to get into the ring. He asks Rocky a favor, to be at his side as his corner-man in a friendly exhibition match against Drago. Rocky reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>Drago dominates and punishes Apollo in the fight. He delivers a last brutal punch to Apollo's head killing him instantly. Rocky is devasted. In order to honor Apollo's spirit he decides to take a rematch against Drago against Adrain's wishes. <br/><br/>But will Rocky triumph over Drago. See this blockbuster film of 1985 to find out.

","This film is the epitome of formula. A cash grab sequel of the worst rank. We find our hero Rocky Balboa pitted against the robotic Ivan Drago. The seemingly invincible Drago kills Apollo Creed in the ring. The same blows that did in poor Apollo simply spur Rocky on however, because he went old school in his training and apparently reacquired the Eye of the Tiger. In the end we see Rocky draped in an American flag and hoisted up as victor over both Drago and the apparatchiks who created and controlled him. So over the top it is hard to believe it was meant to be serious. In addition to all of this we are also forced to endure the uber-skank Brigette Nielson."

","I can completely understand the negative reviews for rocky 5 but why does this masterpiece(haha!) receive such bad reviews.The majestic opening scene which sticks with the perfect rocky formula of using 5 mins of footage from the last movie to make it easier to conjure up a feature films length happily remains.If you look closely the American glove destroys the soviet when they meet.What??!!! surely this is giving the ending away I thought Rocky couldn't win this one!!! This movie is nonstop fun from the start.Along with Arnies Commando I've seen this more than any other movie.(Nightly I think growing up)I'm not saying the money made from a movie is a vindication for it but this is the only film series ever made where each sequel does better than the previous installment.2 made more money than 3.4 made more than 3 etc.Up until 5 of course.The music as always is brilliant melted cheese.Hearts on fire! Strong desire! Is it east versus west or man against man? Its a boxing match lads come on.Ivan Drago has to be up there with Vader for movie villains.There's no conceivable way Rocky could ever win.Drago is stronger younger healthier quicker taller bigger and probably smarter!(and he's on steroids!) And man for a short haired woman Dragos wife is hot.The killing of Apollo is a brave move and a justifiable reason for Rocky to don the gloves one more time.Oh ya it was clearly murder the ref tries to split them up and Drago pushes the REF away!I know it sounds like I'm insulting the movie but its all these things that make it so good.Rocky buys Pauli a robot in 1985 and the artificial intelligence of it is still beyond anything today its absolutely ridiculous.The move to Russia for training was a great idea and feels fresh.I loved the contrasts in the fighters training methods although it looked like Drago was training harder.Tony,Apollos trainer does a great job of hyping Rocky and the audience up.He's not a machine he's a man with tears in his eyes and spit from his mouth.The fight I think is the best in the series.No human could ever survive it.One or two of the 10000 punches they each get would kill a man.It goes the distance of course.I only wish they got the usual 2 commentators for the fight.Don't know why because they do the Drago Apollo fight earlier but the new guys do a decent job as well. Rocky 1 :best acting,story,yawn Rocky 2 :best training montage Rocky 3 :best soundtrack.Mr.T rules and Apollo befriending Rocky.class Rocky 4 :BEST Rocky 5 :suicidally bad Rocky 6 :meh! pretty good Rocky 7 :Mr.T rapes Adrian and kidnaps Rockys son.Rocky strikes up a friendship with Drago(He can change remember!)who helps track down Mr.T with the help of the k.g.b.

","After celebrating Paulie's birthday, word has spread through the media about the Soviet Union entering U.S. territory to compete in boxing. The representatives introduce their fine example of a boxer, Ivan Drago. A buff, silent, and dangerous looking boxer. He's been trained under the supervision of the Soviet Union Boxing league, and he's surpassed any opponent he's faced.<br/><br/>Reason why is because of his strength in punching. One punch and he destroys his opponent. This was broadcast on the News, and they announced that they want to challenge the U.S.'s own Heavy Weight Champion. Apollo saw the whole thing on his TV, and went to Rocky's Manor to tell him about his plan in fighting the amateur boxer. Adrian doesn't consider it a wise idea, because it's been years since the last time Apollo boxed. But Apollo has confidants that he can beat the Communist because of his years of experience. Rocky agrees to aide him during the fight along with Duke, and Paulie.<br/><br/>With a good performance started at the fight in Las Vegas, it ended in disaster. I won't review what happens there, see it in the movie for yourself. But after Apollo's defeat, Rocky isn't going to let a Russian get away without a fight. So he travels to Russia to challenge Ivan to a match on Christmas. But if Apollo couldn't beat Ivan, does that mean Rocky would face the same fate? See the match, and know that Rocky will show the Red Army what America is made out of.<br/><br/>This sequel is pretty cool. Despite Rocky facing his most lethal opponent ever. And this was made when the Soviet Union was still in power. But it does have some good training sequences and a breathe taking fight. just a note that the Apollo Creed Fans might dislike this one. So I suggest renting it first."

","I cannot believe so many people hate this movie. When I was an 11 year old kid at a movie theater with my Dad in 1985, it was the single craziest movie going experience of my young life. I had never been to a movie where people were screaming at the screen and calling one of the main characters a ""commie."" Sure its predictable and the speech at the end is corny, but its Rocky for God's sake, not Shakespeare. Some of the best and most random things occur in this movie: (1) Rocky making the fight on Christmas, (2) anything Drago says, (3) you cannot watch the training montage and not get fired up, (4) when Drago gets cut and the announcer starts going crazy ""He's cut!!!!

Overall, this is a 90 minute music video with some great 80's songs and montage sequences. Dolph Lundgren would agree that this movie made him a star. Since Rocky IV, Dolph has gone on to star in a number of straight to video action films that nobody has seen.<br/><br/>In the end, Rocky IV remains one of the very few entertaining propaganda films that Americans loved."

Although the odds are once again against him, and he's traveling to fight before a very hostile Soviet crowd, Balboa decides that a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. The formula is wearing thin, to say the least, but the training sequences are so adrenaline-pumping, the ring bouts so engaging, and the soundtrack so motivating that actor/writer/director Stallone gets away with murder as he presents a far-fetched, stereotypical script that's anything but credible. Don't think about it too much and you'll probably love it. **½"

There are hits like James Brown's Living in America, John Cafferty's Heart's On Fire, which is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the best training songs of all time, not one but two Survivor songs and other cool compositions like the theme from Vince DiCola's training montage, and one of my personal favorites, No Easy Way Out.

","Rocky IV starts off exactly where Rocky III ended. An ultimate challenger has risen to fame, and this time, Rocky just may have met his match. A Russian boxer, with a brutally powerful 4000 pound psi, has made headlines, looking for his next match. Apollo Creed is interested in facing the challenge after hearing all the hype on TV, and fearlessly faces the deadly Ivan Drago. Things do not turn out well for Apollo. He not only loses, he endures a fatal blow to the head, and Rocky ends up losing the man he befriended, even after stepping in the ring with him himself. Now, if you remember the end of Rocky II, the main event with Rocky and Apollo, you remember how these two were a force to be reckoned with, and the battle in the ring was a close match for both of them. If Ivan Drago can take out Apollo with one punch, what does this mean for Rocky, who is already slowly showing signs of slow down, in mental and physical health. Rocky doesn't care. He wants the ultimate challenge against Ivan Drago, choosing to do a match with no royalties, on Christmas Day, in Russia, Ivans own country. Doing a match, for free, a boxing match risking your own life, to repay Apollo with the ultimate Christmas gift, in Dragos own country? Wow! Rocky means BUSINESS here! To take on the incredibly powerful Ivan Drago is going to mean Rocky is going to have to go through some pretty painful training, as he doesn't stand a chance of possessing a 4000 pound psi such as Ivan Drago himself. He's going to have to rebuild himself, from head to toe, before he can step head to toe with Drago in the ring. Rocky IV may or may not be the best in the series, it can be argued, but what cannot be argued, is that this film was by far the most exciting. Through the clever montages, it manages to pump up your own blood, and root more then ever for Rocky. There are a number of reasons why Rocky wants to take down the mighty Drago, all of which Adrian won't be able to understand, feeling as if he's committing suicide just by getting in the ring with him, and declaring to Rocky that he can't win. Rocky is going to do everything he can to prove her and the rest of the world wrong. Rocky 4 gets 7 out of 10 stars!"

","Italian-American boxing champion Rocky Balboa becomes an all-American hero by taking on Russia in the ring, the Eastern Bloc represented by formidable Soviet slugger Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). Having already killed Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) during an exhibition match in the States, Drago sets his sights on the reigning Heavyweight Champion of the World, keen to prove his superiority over the West. Determined to avenge his friend, Rocky flies to the USSR to train, his old-school techniques in stark contrast with Drago's high-tech regime (which includes pumping steroids: those dirty, cheatin' Russkies!).<br/><br/>If you thought that Rocky III was cartoonish nonsense, you ain't seen nothin' yet, for Rocky IV goes even further into the realms of the absurd, with a jingoistic, flag-waving fantasy that sees Stallone putting Mother Russia in her place, as he would also do four years later in Rambo III, where he helped the Taliban fight the evil Russian army. My, how times have changed.<br/><br/>This very silly film starts as it means to go on with Rocky and family presenting Paulie (Burt Young) with a very special birthday gift, a robot that wouldn't have looked out of place in an episode of Lost in Space. It really is a stupid looking thing, with an oversized head, lots of blinking diodes and an AI system that is light-years ahead of its time, but it does let the viewer know immediately that this third sequel is far from grounded in reality. Likewise, Drago is very much an OTT cartoon villain: unfeeling, almost robotic, and superhuman, punching over twice as hard as his American opponents. This fact doesn't stop Rocky from showing 'The Siberian Express' who is best, defeating the ice-cold Russian with a good old dose of US grit, determination, and, of course, the eye of the tiger!<br/><br/>Once again written and directed by Stallone, Rocky IV knows its audience and plays to it, with clear-cut heroes and villains, and an outcome more predictable than Jeffrey Epstein's 'suicide'. But as formulaic and stupefyingly daft as it all is, it sure is fun. Stallone has never looked better, his physique even more ripped than in part III; Lundgren is suitably emotionless; James Brown turns up to sing 'Living in America' before Apollo's Las Vegas defeat; there's not one, but two montages, the first playing like an MTV music video as Rocky is lost in his thoughts while driving, and the second being the obligatory grab-bag of training scenes (also set to a rousing rock number); and the whole thing culminates in the hard-hitting fight between East and West, not in the least bit realistic, but still exhilarating.<br/><br/>After the battle between the superpowers is over, Drago having been defeated in the closing seconds of the 15th round, Rocky delivers a heartwarming speech about how we should put our differences aside and learn to be friends. Just so long as America is the more powerful friend."

Stereotypical East versus West premise was fine. And injecting Drago? Did the filmmakers know something we didn't! Putting aside the preposterous premise, there was real emotion in the film, especially the aftermath of Creed's death and Rocky's guilt, which was mercifully left unsaid, but SS' admirable acting together with cleverly placed flashbacks ensured you knew the guilt of Rocky not throwing in the towel (despite Creed's instructions not to) was eating away at him. To be fair I can't remember a film I've enjoyed so much yet only given it 7 out of ten, so perhaps deserves an 8 and I should just forgive the cheese on this occasion. Okay, 8 out of ten."

Okay.<br/><br/>Drago is one dimensional and not very interesting. Stallone and Adrian sleep walk through another of their motivational speech type speeches (yawn), but where this film really excels is in its action, it's bombast, it's soundtrack ( which I had on repeat for years as a kid), that iconic poster, colours, jingoism, the whole damn package. It's shiny and polished and still holds up 33 years later. It hasn't aged one bit.

","Rocky IV is an in between good and very good film with excellent acting by Sylvester Stallone as Rocky, Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Paulie, Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, Dolph Lundgren as Ivan Drago and Brigitte Nielsen as Ludmilla. When the Russian Ivan Drago came to fight and Apollo Creed fought but Drago killed him in the ring, Rocky, his family and friends were saddened and also angry. So Rocky prepared to go to Russia to fight against the killer Ivan Drago. The film does have some great action and is a bit tense but it also is not tense enough and does lack things which Rocky III doesn't. Ivan Drago(played by Dolph Lundgren) was a powerful opponent and did also have some powerful punches but I didn't like him. The character Ivan Drago hardly spoke and just said only a few things, but his Russian supporters such as his wife Ludmilla(played by Brigitte Nielsen) were completely unnecessary and they shouldn't have put her in this film. The other Russian supporters were boasting and saying how great Ivan Drago was, that Drago was indestructible and showing their hatred towards the Americans. The character Ivan Drago was also a very powerful fighter but definitely not indestructible and not as Brutal as Clubber Lang(played by Mr. T) in Rocky III or ruthless as Tommy Gunn in Rocky V. There were some great fight scenes in the film and Ivan Drago fought well, but Clubber Lang in Rocky III was faster, his punches were fast, very powerful and very brutal and Tommy Gunns punches were also very powerful and brutal. The final fight was awesome and Rocky fought really well against Drago beating him and proving to the others including the Russians that the Russians are not the best and that Drago is not as good as he or they think he is."

","This installment of Rocky slightly recaptures the inspiration and spirit of the originals, but seems to be missing something. It wasn't long enough and had too many montages to lengthen it out. I must say that the montage of Rocky driving his Ferrari thinking about his now deceased friend brought more emotional impact to the film. The scene of the American boxing commission refusing to sanction Rocky's fight with Drago should of been included in the original because it clears up the confusion as to why the title was not on the line. Great music although I miss Bill Conti's score from the previous films. Solid performances from everbody including Bridgette Nielson as she's basically Drago's wife and spokesperson. Dolph Lundgren didn't have to do too much except look intimidating and destroy people. The Russian spectators suddenly cheering for Rocky half way through the fight? Give me a break. Entertaining but a little far fetched"

","Rocky 4 is one of those films that is over he top and so engrossed in the 80's that despite it not being the best it is almost a good film. This is due to the comedy element included with Pauline and the robot of course. However Stallone clearly lost it after the original film and has made this almost a parody of the original film. I believe that this film is great for a 10 year old who will believe in a boxing match ending the Cold War (like I did when I was younger) However it clearly does not have the same character depth and plot that makes it a compelling and serious story."

","Virtually the same movie as ""Rocky III"", with a better (and longer) climactic fight, but Dolph Lundgren, although physically intimidating, is a wooden log in terms of personality in comparison to Mr.T. Stallone's screenplay is formulaic to the extreme, and often ridiculous (how can anyone last 15 rounds with a man who supposedly has three times the punching power of the average heavyweight? As for the Russian crowd chanting ""Rocky! Rocky!"", yeah, sure...), but as a director he keeps the film speeding like a runaway locomotive, and the editing is sometimes exhilaratingly masterful.

"Uriah43","6","0","0","28 January 2016"," A New Opponent--from the Soviet Union
","After managing to recapture his heavyweight championship belt from ""Clubber Lang"" (Mr. T) in the previous movie, ""Rocky Balboa"" (Sylvester Stallone) doesn't feel he has anything further to prove. Unfortunately, his friend and rival, ""Apollo Creed"" (Carl Weathers) doesn't share that same feeling and as a result he jumps at the chance to fight a new boxer from the Soviet Union named ""Drago"" (Dolph Lundgren). Although he is making the transition from amateur to professional, Drago isn't a typical athlete. Instead, he is a product of both legal and illegal scientific enhancements that have made him into a super-fighting machine capable of destroying anybody who gets into the ring with him. And he wants to prove just how great he is by fighting the heavyweight champion of the world-Rocky Balboa. The only thing standing in his way is Apollo Creed. Now as far as this movie is concerned I will just say that--in spite of the three other films that preceded it-this picture manages to stand on its own. As a matter of fact, it probably has more action than the previous movies which certainly doesn't hurt it in any way. Unfortunately, what did hurt this movie, in my opinion, was the corny speech at the end which would be laughable if it wasn't meant to be taken so seriously. Be that as it may, the majority of the movie was decent enough and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

","Remember when Rocky ended the Cold War? No? Well he did. He strapped himself in and leaped over a shark to do it.<br/><br/>Rocky 4 makes the grave mistake of trying to get political and meaningful in a Rocky movie. The first Rocky was beautiful because it was simple and meaningful in the sense that it was autobiographical of Stallone's life. Now that Stallone got comfortable in his shoes as the famous boxer, he (admittedly) ran out of ideas. Now, there are some great moments and plot points in Rocky 4, but the execution is poor.<br/><br/>Rocky 4 sees the tragic departure of Apollo Creed at the hands of Ivan Drago, the Soviet man- mountain. The character of Drago as created by Dolph Lundgren and Stallone is frighteningly intense and stoic. Close up shots of his eyes and Lundgren's perpetually mask-like expression do the character well. Weathers rounds out his role in the franchise nicely, whilst Stallone feels like he's sleepwalking and has lost all connections to the sweetly shy boxer he played in the first two films. Adrian is shunted even further to the sidelines, confirming her once and for all to the ""supportive wife"" trope and giving her nothing to do. <br/><br/>The death of Creed is very upsetting and Drago's menace is established well early on. The screenplay shows that Stallone can still pen some sweet moments - Paulie's emotional outburst feels out of place but its still a nice scene, and there's a few bits of humour that land nicely. The character of Duke Evers could have been given much more prominence - I understand that Rocky doesn't need training at this point in his life, but Tony Burton's emotional scenes are among the film's best and the idea that he and Rocky would click together had the most potential. Duke lost his ""son"" Apollo in the way that Rocky lost Mickey. The contrast between Rocky and Drago is strong (even though the red filter is far from subtle) as it portrays Rocky as a back to basics whilst Drago is portrayed as a factory product. <br/><br/>But the flaws are just too big to ignore. Its insane how much of a 90 minute movie can be dedicated to flashbacks. I estimate that almost 10% of the film is flashbacks in the form of Rocky's tradition in showing the final scene of the preceding film and a bizarre flashback montage at around the 43 minute mark that serves little purpose. There's just nothing else going on in this film. Two short fights and a training montage in between. There's no sense of drama. Additionally, Bill Conti's iconic score is completely absent. Why? A Rocky film without the Rocky theme is utterly stupid and whilst Hearts on Fire had its moments, I was still waiting for Gonna Fly Now to start blazing."

","Continuing my reviews for all the rocky films see me review rocky 4. The premise of the film is that after the death of a close friend he decides to go to Russia to challenge an almost invincible opponent. Sylvester Stallone is back as rocky and he does a good job in this film selling the personal anguish in his character and you understand why he needs this fight. Carl weathers is back as Apollo creed and even though not a huge role he does a good job in this film. This film was Dolph lundgrens break out role as Ivan drago and he was great as the robotic giant and it really worked. However, I thought that the return of Adrian and Paulie didn't come across that well in this film and could have been missing from this film completely. The overall story is pretty emotional and a great dramatic tale of redemption. However, especially towards the start it does feel rushed and a bit like a chunk of the film is missing. The script has some really good drama in it and allot of well placed humour involved. The style of the film is great, the boxing scenes are high impact and filmed brilliantly, same as the well placed training montage. Overall this is a great rocky movie that I would definitely advise seeing."

","The most commercially successful film in Rocky franchise that utilises the tension between US & USSR to its advantage, there is no denying that Rocky IV brims with a strong dose of patriotism from start to finish but apart from that and a truly intimidating antagonist, there is nothing impressive about it for the story is only as good as the previous two chapters.<br/><br/>The fourth instalment in the Rocky series, Rocky IV continues the journey of Rocky Balboa as the reigning world heavyweight champion challenges a virtually invincible opponent from the Soviet Union for a match in Moscow in order to avenge the death of Apollo Creed, who was mercilessly beaten to death by the Russian in an exhibition match, and to also defend the honour of his country.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Sylvester Stallone, Rocky IV continues to milk the franchise for all its worth but it does manage to offer a few interesting moments over the course of its runtime. The shortcomings that were evident in the direction & writing aspects of Rocky II & Rocky III continue here as well, the action segments range from impressive to absurd, and the drama is once again a weak element.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are more refined, Bill Conti's absence from the music department is felt at times, and watching Apollo Creed getting beaten to a pulp after such an exaggerated entrance of his is no doubt hilarious as hell. The reprising cast has been in stealth mode since the first movie and nothing much changes here. Dolph Lundgren however does well with what he's given and makes his character of Ivan Drago truly frightening to an extent.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Rocky IV is definitely more enjoyable, entertaining & rewarding than the previous two entries and the final fight also manages to live up to its hype to finish the story on a rousing high but the inconsistency in its storytelling department and shallow work from its cast never really allow this sequel to lift from the ground and even with more budget & bigger ambitions, it fails to emulate the overall success of the original. Nevertheless, Rocky IV is worth a shot."

Dolph Londgren the king size Tab Hunter look alike playing Russian and gold medal Olympic super heavyweight boxing champion Ivan Drago in fact knocked the wind out of Stallone while filming a boxing scene in the movie that he ended up in the hospital, with a damaged heart and 200 over 140 blood pressure reading, in critical condition for over a week. Lundgren also mauled and manhandled actor Carl Weathers, who played former heavyweight champ Apollo Creed, so badly that he walked off the set until he was talked into coming back by Stallone among others to finish his part in the movie.<br/><br/>This time around Rocky happily retired from boxing is forced to come back for just one more bout against the Siberian Express Ivan Drago after he knocked out cold and killed Apollo Creed in an exhibition match held at Las veges' MGM Grand Hotel Casino. With the ""Fight of the Century"" scheduled to take place at Moscow's Olympic Arena on Christmas Day Rocky has to get himself into the best shape in his career to take on and beat the big bad an invincible Russian Bear. With the late Apollo's manager Duke Evers,Tony Burton, training him in the snowy wastelands of Siberia Rocky feels that he's now ready to do the impossible; Beat the Soviet giant and beat him on his home turf and at his own game.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** In the early rounds of the bout it's Dargo's superior hight & strength as well as 90 inch reach that plummets and ties up, in the ropes & clinches, Rocky in his attempts to get inside him and punch away at his midsection. That in an effort to get Dargo to drop his guard and then have Rocky open up upstairs on his jaw in order to put the big guy away. With the rounds ticking away and despite the devastating punishment that he's taken Rocky is still on his feet by the time the last and 15th round comes around. with Rocky losing on points but still sanding on his feet it's the Russian crowd together with the Soviet Primier, played by a Mikhail Gorbachev look alike actor,that stands up and cheer on the American representative of the hated capitalist system Rocky Balboa against their home town hero and man of the people Ivan Dargo! That more then anything else energizes Rocky to keep up the good fight and with a dozen or so devastating body blows followed up by head shots puts the by now spent and exhausted Soviet Superman away with seconds to go in the 15th round.<br/><br/>With no more worlds or opponents to conquer and having avenged Apollo's death in the ring at the hands of Ivan Dargo a battered and bloodied Rocky Balboa gives a speech to the filled to capacity audience in the boxing arena about how peace on earth and goodwill for all men is possible if only we can put our differences behind us just like he and Drago, who by now has the greatest respect for his once hated American opponent, did to the cheers of all the spectators including the Soviet Premier and the entire Politburo.

","Rocky is one of my favourite movie series ever. I love all of them (except 5) But out of all of them, 4 is definitely the most over-the-top. Rocky 4 takes the series way out of basics. This time Rocky goes out of USA to fight a Russian boxer, Ivan Drago. He trains with old fashioned outdoor training while Drago trains with technology and steroids! This movie has by far the best training montage. However, this is the only Rocky film without Gonna Fly Now or any of Bill Conti's music. Instead it's mostly rock and techno,but they're my favourite genres of music, and the soundtrack is awesome. I especially like hearts on fire and War. This movie is very entertaining, but is probably the weakest film in the series. I prefer it over 5, but 5 has a storyline that progresses the plot. Rocky 4 doesn't add much to the story except for Apollo Creed's death, and the movie doesn't take itself very seriously at times. The scenes with the robot are campy and out of place and as much as I love the montages, they drag the movie sometimes. But Rocky 4 is still very entertaining and a great Rocky film."

","Pound for pound (as they say), this has to be the most cliché dialoged film I've ever seen. The one in my summary line came from Rocky's trainer Duke (Tony Burton) in his conversation with the champ in Russia, and other examples abound. There's the bedtime chat with Rocky's son - ""We can't change what we are"" and the 'no matter what' conversation with Adrian (Talia Shire) prior to the big bout in Moscow. Along with the generous helping of flashback scenes from the first three Rocky films, this picture took the lazy way out with no pretense of offering a compelling narrative built on character development or effective story telling.<br/><br/>That's not to say the picture didn't have it's moments. Probably the best sequence of the film had those juxtaposed scenes of Rocky and Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) immersed in their training regimen; Rocky battling the elements in the harsh Russian countryside, Drago pumping up with the latest technologically advanced equipment and monitored to the max for ultimate physical output and endurance. The intended effect was palpable, the manufactured athlete would prove superior to the natural one.<br/><br/>Ultimately though, I can't get that excited about this installment in the franchise. Just about everything in the film screamed copycat for it's imitation of the first three films, from the flashback scenes to Apollo Creed's (Carl Weathers) impersonation of Muhammad Ali, to the physical impossibility of each man absorbing so much punishment in the ring and still standing. I know, it's just a movie, but this one created an unnecessary low in the series. I mean really, how can you take it seriously when Paulie (Burt Young) comes out with a line like ""Blast this guys teeth out!"""

","For the most part, the beginning of the movie is set in both the Soviet Union and in Philadelphia. This is where they introduce the main character Rocky with a flashback of his previous fight to regain the heavy weight championship belt against Clubber Lang. After Rocky is introduced, he is now depicted as the coach for his best friend Apollo Creed. At the start of the movie Apollo is set to fight Ivan Drago, the ""Superman"" boxer from the Soviet Union. The fight ends as Apollo suffers a fatal blow to the head. This leads to more conflict, between the United States and the Soviet Union, but also between Rocky and Ivan Drago, as Rocky believes he is the one who should seek revenge for the death of his best friend. With this in mind, he goes against all measures and declares that he will fight Ivan Drago in the Soviet Union. As a result in the film, Balboa is portrayed to play that underdog role, and battle his way as he comes back from retirement to struggle his way to a benchmark of success. This is the main theme in the movie, especially when they show how he perseveres through immense dedication and focus towards his goal. Furthermore, he takes a flight for the Siberian jungle leaving his family and friends behind so he can prepare mentally and physically for this fight. The only people who accompany him on the trip are his coach, yet later his wife and his brother in law end up joining him. The movie itself does a marvelous job at portraying what it takes to be the best, and how if you really want something you have to be willing to put the work in to achieve it."

The movie has a Russian boxer coming to America to take on any challenger bold enough to go head to head with him. For some reason, this infuriates Apollo and he is the one to challenge the Russian. Well the fight occurs and tragedy occurs, to much tragedy we lose one of the most interesting and fun Rocky characters when all he had to to was lose and maybe get partially paralyzed or something. Apollo dying just mirrored Mickey's death in the previous movie to much. Well now Rocky wants revenge and he is going to Russia to fight the monster that killed his friend.

Apparently he knows something we don't about simply telling a story. Sometimes it works for him, and he writes Rocky. Sometimes it doesn't, and he ""writes"" Rocky IV. I emphasize that word because the movie is little more than a couple of sweet 80's montages thrown together.

Creed hasn't been training hard enough though, and the Russkie kills him in the ring. So what can Rocky do but challenge him in his fatherland and show him the shining light of the American way? This movie is awful in everything it does, from the flat characterization of  well, everyone, to the ludicrous fight scenes. In the first couple of Rockys, I could believe that those men at least received some boxing training to look good in the ring. That was abandoned for the fourth chapter, in which the actors prance around the ring like professional wrestlers, shoving and head-butting all over the place.

It's a huge credit for Stallone how he can make the same formula successful 4 times in a row. Rocky 4 boasts some of the coolest training montages ever and with the help of a knockout music score the film is simply cool. The film clocks in at under 90 minutes so the dramatic parts are handled with speed and viewers don't have to wait long for the action to kick in. There are two training sequences where he's in the snow either running or training furiously with just about everything in sight. Then there's the epic battle between Rocky and Drago in the ring which still today looks smashing.<br/><br/>The cast is always right on the money and Dolph Lundgren is still a childhood favorite of mine after playing Drago. Rocky looks quite a bit different but he's still appealing.<br/><br/>Rocky 4 is a formula but it's got great set pieces, cool training scenes and a killer soundtrack (No Easy Way Out is probably my favorite ever song).

(""great"" as in movies like ""As Good As It Gets"" that have great acting by great actors) Absolutely and totally not! Is it cheesy with the 80's music, predictable plot of Invincible Villain versus a beloved underdog? Absolutely yes! Is it all about training scenes, boxing, and action? Pretty much! Is there much substance to the movie? It could be argued, but the substance that is there is a little contrived. (Seriously: would a stadium full of USSR fans really chant for Rocky near the end of the fight?) <br/><br/>Having said all of that: I love this movie! Here's why: <br/><br/>I remember seeing this movie in the theaters when I was 10 years old. Of course being that young, loving Rocky movies, and not caring at all if it was actually a ""good"" movie, I walked out of the theater with my best friend, went home, and began training and boxing! I mean...how many people have finished a Rocky film and not wanted to start boxing the first thing you see? The point is: through 10 year old eyes this movie was awesome! <br/><br/>Fast forward a few years. Growing up in the 80's mind you, I didn't see the music being as cheesy as I do today. I loved the Training Montage music and remember running with my portable tape player (no CD's yet) and as soon as the song was done, I would rewind it and play it again. I did that for miles! As I grew older did I see Rocky IV for everything I said at the beginning of this thread? Yes. Did that stop me from loving it? NO! It still inspired me...the music still inspired me.<br/><br/>And now here I am, still loving the movie, still loving the music. Why? I think a lot of it is nostalgia. It takes me back to that 10 year old boy and I have those same feelings...it takes me back to when I was 16 and ran everyday with that music. I love the way it makes me feel, and I still think despite all of its problems...it is still inspiring. It still inspires me to keep exercising!<br/><br/>So, even though it isn't ""great"", I will still love and watch this movie...cheesy plot-line, music, message, and all..."

The details in-between don't really matter but if you're interested this time it's personal as Rocky's former Nemesis, turned friend, turned trainer Apollo Creed decides he's regarded as yesterday's man and vainly challenges Soviet killing machine Ivan Drago (Dolph Lungren) to an exhibition fight in which he's the only person surprised by his untimely death. The Italian Stallion could leave it there but a)Drago is ill-advisedly unrepentant and b)if he did the movie would be half an hour long so the revenge match is set for Christmas Day back in the good 'ol USSR and...well you know the rest. The forth Rocky is mindless entertainment and a blatant self-parody but although you could write the whole thing in less time than it takes for Apollo's bloody head to hit the canvas it's genuinely enjoyable stuff. From the moment Creed is, as the Scots say, deed, the rest of the film is pure 80's excess - a clip strewn montage, a cheesy power ballad, Rocky coming to terms with his demons by driving his Ferrari through the night etc, etc... When the Rockster gets to Russia (Wyoming apparently) he's got only revenge on his mind and so we get to the final 45 minutes which every Rocky fan waits for in which Stallone's back to basics, low tech approach - cutting logs with a axe, pulling cars, climbing mountains, is contrasted with the Soviet's high-tech, computerised training programme. All your instincts tell you that Rocky is doomed but as he reaches the summit of that slope, the synthesiser score reaching a crescendo you know that somehow Americas going to pull it out of the bag and although you were a hardened cynic just half an hour earlier, you're now watching the most unlikely match-up in boxing history chanting ""Rocky! Rocky!"". This may be the brilliance of Stallone's film because although its as sophisticated as some twigs and a bit of flint, it's almost impossible not to root for the inevitable victor - shameless manipulation aside, which is basically the entire film, you're a cold hearted, joy-less shell if you don't go ""yeeeahhh"" when Drago is finally cut by Rocky's punch even though in reality Rocky would have to have arms 8 feet in length just to reach the Soviet's face. Not everyone would have the guts to distill the entire cold war into a single boxing match with Stallone the unlikely broker of peace but just such a miracle occurs here and when Rocky gives his slurred, barely inaudible riposte to the tensions between the superpowers ""If I cun chaaange, then youu cun chaangge, we caaan all changee!"" and even Gorbachov gets to his feet you know you've transcended mere popcorn fare and entered the arena of comic genius. The Reds might be a bunch of humourless, oppressed warmongers but they're no match for the Gipper's pugilist special envoy. Is it any wonder the evil empire collapsed after this?"

","As a kid, Rocky IV was the film I most wanted to see in the cinema - ever!! The hype was huge - I dreamt about the movie before even seeing it! I remember the aura surrounding the huge mysterious new bad guy in Drago and the rumours that Apollo gets killed.<br/><br/>Watching it as an adult though is obviously an entirely different experience. The film has dated mainly due to the anti-USSR overtones - but then this was made in the mid 80's cold-war era. It is laughable at times, what with Paulie's talking robot - the ridiculous press conference before Rocky v Drago, the sports scientists and their massive 80's computers and all the stereotypical portrayals of Russians and KGB agents - hey even ex-president Gorbachev(complete with stained forehead) is in it!! <br/><br/>Then there are the silly pop-video type scenes, the poor acting from the boxers' wives, and that cheesy final scene with Rocky's kid and friends watching the fight on TV (btw: poor casting of Rocky's son - both his parents are Italian-Americans yet the boy here wasn't -an indication of the lack of attention to detail and slipping standards in the Rocky series.)<br/><br/>The best thing about Rocky IV are the 2 fights, although totally unbelievable and the training scenes. Hats off to Dolph Lundgren, Stallone and Carl Weathers for getting into such fantastic physical shape for this film - it will probably inspire you to hit the gym and has that feel-good factor like Rocky III did."

Now why would when apollo was knocked down and unconscious would there be no doctors or any medical attention. He just dies in rocky's arms. It seems that the top priority when apollo was just about to die, wasn't to get him medical attention, but to get a microphone to Drago for his comments.

Because in this sequel each fighter knows what has to be done, and both do it. And Drago seemingly being the unbreakable machine made for the best fight scenario, ""you see he's not machine, he's a man"" which makes it brilliant when Drago refers to Rocky as not human, ""he's like a piece of iron"" The rolls become reversed in the end, notice the look in Drago's eyes after the last round, while he's being comforted by his wife, a man spent, a man, a character who chased the limits of what it is to be human, realizing then that he's breakable. And afterwards for us who put our bodies and lifes through the plastic mats in wrestling rooms, who have their hands ripped to pieces because of iron dumbbells, which one of them doesn't ask themselves after seeing this movie ""how far can i push myself"".

I watched as Rocky Balboa went from a world famous underdog to a courageous nobody and then to World Heavyweight Champion in Rocky 2. I watched as Rocky Balboa went from the world heavyweight champion to a nobody, and back to the world heavyweight champion. The one thing the above three have in common is an abundance of downtime where very little is happening. <br/><br/>That's what is different about Rocky IV. The only downtime in the movie is at the very beginning when Apollo Creed is convincing the world why he should fight the Russian. From there the pace gradually increases. We see the Rocky highlight reel followed by a pair of intense training sequences to an actual soundtrack. Of all the movies these two training sequences are only outdone by the upbeat and inspirational training sequences of Rocky III. And to cap it all off comes the best fight scene of all the Rocky movies. I still can't help but get goosebumps when you hear the announcer exclaim ""He's cut, the Russian is cut."" From there it is 13 more rounds of head to head, gut busting action. <br/><br/>The only downside to this movie is the ineffective attempt at trying to make a political statement.

Let's see... what are the chances of that happening?<br/><br/>Rocky Balboa is a man who has trouble with words. Thus, Stallone's portrayal of him as verbally stumbling and bumbling represents GREAT ACTING! Contrary to the belief of some, acting is not the work of geniuses. Just read the lines on the page, make some believable faces, and you're good to go. There aren't many, but a few famous actors are on record saying as much.<br/><br/>Basically, the hateful messages and critiques directed towards this and the other 'Rocky' films are just the resentful rantings of bitter, pseudo-elite types who vastly prefer the dark, morose, unnecessarily obscure films of the art-house ouevre.

","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>Semi retired Rocky Balboa is finally enjoying life after winning his title back from Clubber Lang, he is now best of friends with Apollo Creed and has enough money to live a wealthy life and buy Lamboughini's and cheesy 80's robots for Rocky jnr to play with. When a rookie boxer Ivan Drago nicknamed `The Siberian Express' arrives from Russia and dares anyone to defeat him, Apollo takes up the offer to the protests of Rocky and organises an exhibition fight against him. Innevitably Apollo gets his ass whipped and tragically dies in the ring, after hearing the Russian declare ""If he dies , he dies"", Rocky vows to beat Drago in the ring but insists that it be in Russia in front of Drago's own people and the president of Russia.<br/><br/>Rocky is perhaps the most entertaining although most unrealistic of all the Rocky films, Stallone looks in the best shape of his life here and there is not an inch of fat on him, acting wise he puts in his usual Rocky performance which is fine. There are people who say the Rocky Balboa seems like a different character in Rocky III and IV to that of 1 and 2 but remember that in the first 2 films he was illiterate and Adrian taught him how to read, so in 3 and 4 he's older and has been exposed to the high life. Dolph Lundgren, although not having to do all that much is great as Ivan Drago, he brings the perfect blend of menace and athleticism. Burt Young's role as Paulie has become more and more detailed over the films and here we see him more as Rocky's friend than whining brother in-law. Talia Shire as Adrian is more or less no different from Rocky III providing the mother figure for Rocky to turn to. The Music is one of the highlights of the film, in many ways it is the definitive 80's soundtrack with tracks like `Hearts On Fire'. This makes the training scenes all that more compelling, who doesn't get a shiver down their spine when Rocky is lifting the cart with Adrian and Tony in it. It makes you want to start training yourself. The end fight scene is very entertaining but throws any bit of realism out of the window. Lennox Lewis or Evander Holyfield must cringe when they watch these scenes because Rocky must take about 100 clear shots to the face but still comes back, in reality the ref would have stop the fight in the 3rd round and declared Drago the winner.<br/><br/>In 1985 Sylvester Stallone was arguably the most famous man on the planet, having Rocky IV and Rambo - First Blood Part II come out in the same year. This was also the peak of Stallone's career, no one can deny he was box office gold. Everything he did from here was relatively dissappointing. A few exceptions like Rambo III, Demolition Man, Cop Land but mostly he made rot like Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot or his latest flops like Driven and D-Tox. My advice to Sly to get back on track is play a villain. Yeah I know he's a villain in Spy Kids 3 but come on that doesn't really count. I say that he should look out for a good script from a good young director. In a future Tarantino film perhaps.

Along with those, the film has terrific music for when it's time to train in Russia (especially a piece called none other than, 'training montage'). The movie does have it's dramatic moments, but they're distinguished by the great feelings that everyone gets when seeing the Rocky series.

Also in the movie they showed two different training styles. Rocky using whatever he has and Drago in a State-Sponsored training facility.

","I am sure that when a person loses a friend to death, that it is hard to take. Yet to see them being killed and then to be killed, would have to be almost impossible to tolerate. Rocky IV is not about revenge, when it quite easily could have been. Instead it is a film about Rocky Balboa who fights to right a wrong for his best friend. Rocky IV will make the hair on the back of the neck stand up! <br/><br/>Rocky Balboa is pitted against Russian heavyweight challenger, a merciless fighting machine  the best that Soviet science and medicine can create, his name is Ivan Drago, the Russian boxer with the rocket launch punch. Following the death of Apollo Creed in a match against Drago and in a bid to avenge the loss of his friend, Rocky takes up the challenge to fight the newest heavyweight contender. Supported by technologically advanced training methods and based on his past performances, Drago looks certain to claim the crown. Rocky again is the underdog. As Drago goes through his high tech workouts, Rocky is seen slogging through hip deep snow. Training, however, can only take a fighter so far. Drago has the biochemical and physiological makings of a champion, but Rocky has the heart<br/><br/>This movie was very poignant in story and in acting. There are many scenes that really touched me, none more so than when Rocky tells Adrian he has to fight Drago. Rocky is at the bottom of a staircase, with Adrian at the top. She says that he can not win, and that he is playing with death wish. Through all this Rocky ignores his wife's wishes and will fight, to the death if need be. There always seems to be a scene in these films that really standouts. This such a scene.  Yet the death of Apollo Creed was also well shot in Rocky IV. I am still not sure if seeing someone being killed is a good scene or not? <br/><br/>The cast of this Rocky was once again very powerful. I want to first of all talk about the mean role taken on by Muscle man, Dolph Lundgren. He was good in this film, though he hardly says a word. His facial expressions are extraordinary, yet I am sure he is made to look as brutal as he is for the movie. He was the perfect man for the role of Ivan Drago.<br/><br/>
There is not much that can be faulted about the role and the impact that Sylvester Stallone has in Rocky. Again he had made up a  wonderful script for this film, and undertook a powerful role. I wish we had a real life Rocky, because I am sure that he would be as popular in this world as he is in the movie. Talia Shire was again great in her Role as Adrian. Although she does not have faith that her husband can beat the merciless Russian, she stands behind her man, as only she could. I would love to have a girl like Adrian behind me if I was in trouble. <br/><br/>The role of Paulie has always been a questioned one by me. Yet in this Ricky he was great. He showed how good a brother-in law he really is and stood by Rocky all the way. Burt Young has had a long career staring in the recent hit with Hugh Grant, Mickey Blue Eyes. It was sad to see Apollo Creed bow out of the Rocky saga, yet the writing was one the cards for him. He did not know what sort of fighter he was going up against and paid the ultimate price. His showman side, also made him seem too cocky. From where I view it, in the ring you only need to feel confident, but try to contain that emotion, as your opponent, will then not know how to take you. Carl Weathers was a great choice as Apollo Creed.<br/><br/>Rocky IV gave viewers a good look at the country of Russia. I am sure that it would be extremely cold in that part of the world, but it was an igneous decision on Stallone's behalf to have Rocky fight in the challengers home country, as the odds of winning were even greater against Balboa, then they were in America. I especially liked the shots viewers get to see in the snowy country side. <br/><br/>After the events of September 11 2001, America and the world mourned a tragic event. Yet after watching this movie, I feel that America has a lot to be proud of as a country and can take away that feeling from this movie. Rocky also proves how heart' can mean the difference between winning or losing. Sure it is good to have strength, but without heart, it is no weapon at all. Obviously the Rocky series was beginning to become a little stale' for the fans, yet this movie still had some of the Rocky magic, that started way back in the 1970's.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 stars or 7/10"

For it's the Red Army's Drago who is scientifically selected for his genes and trained to perfection, with one sly syringe shot suggesting an assist from illicit substances. Poor old America can only field an unconfident, mumbling, stumbling fellow who hides out in a log cabin with his klutz of a brother and trains by chopping wood or hopping across half-frozen streams. The message for 90% of the movie is: Russia's the future, Reagan's America is the primitive past. <br/><br/>And then- guess what happens in the ring, under the very noses of the Politburo led by a Gorbachev lookalike? Before the unsurprising finale, the 20 or so minutes of plot in this 90 minute film give us plenty of time to contemplate its deficiencies: there is no Burgess Meredith keeping Mr Balboa up to scratch, the wives are superfluous (Nielsen snarls and sneers but contributes nothing to the story) and the Soviets are depicted not so much as enjoyably bad guys as sullen, arrogant nullities. Instead of a tale with twists and turns, we are served endless montages to bombastic music, including a reprise of Rocky's golden moments with and without Apollo Creed from previous instalments.<br/><br/>At least the non-championship grudge match goes close to the distance, rather than aborting in round two like most heavyweight bouts in the real world of Don King and alphabet-soup boxing organisations. Remarkable, since Drago is credited with a punch that packs 2,150 psi: enough to drive Rocky's teeth backward through his neck the first time the Russian robot connected. Still, if two white guys can be rated top in the world, one should not expect verisimilitude in the way they fight either."

Sly Stallone once more dons the tights as Rocky Balboa to fight the russian menace Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren, the world's coolest inhabitant)and avenge the death of his friend Apollo Creed.  Now, it's not the plot which makes this movie great, as you can probably predict absolutly everything that's going to happen. No No, what makes this movie great are the momments.  I'm talking about the ""remembering Apollo"" montage in which Rocky is in his car, and shifts gears around 9 or 10 times.  I'm also talking about the training montage in which Rocky climbs a mountain with nothing more than a coat and hat and yells ""DRAAAAAAAAGOOOOOOOOO!"" when he reaches the top. I'm talking about Dolph coldly telling Rocky ""I must break you."" I'm talking about the russian fans cheering for Rocky. I'm talking about the booming, echoing thuds when the boxers hit each other.  It's absurdity at it's best. How can you not love this movie? So if you hate this movie, go ahead and watch it again, this time with an open mind.. and I promise you that your opinion will change.

","The fourth installment in the Rocky saga reaches new heights of predictability. Whereas the original film blossomed with plot, character development, and a thrilling conclusion, Rocky IV gives us another revenge plot (Rocky fights Drago to avenge the death of Apollo Creed), no character development, but the final fight sequence is done well, even if it is unrealistic. For instance, if Drago can punch 4 times harder than any other heavyweight how come Rocky isn't pulverised? This is a bad film, but it's just so good at being a bad film."

","Yes a very flawed film. But a guilty pleasure. Rocky IV's ultimate downfall was that it turned the series into a political . Which Stallone isn't too flash at doing. The ending of this film with the 'change' speech is just too ridiculous . But Dolph Lundgren has never been better as the stereotypical Russian killing machine. Proof that the silent villian usually works. There are a couple of scenes in the film with flare. Apollo Creed's death scene is one of the most dramatic and depressing  in the series and does make you root for Rocky the more. The training scene with Rocky climbing the mountain, is pretty to look at and the end fight scene is totally unbelievable but totally entertaining. It is too short, too much like an MTV video clip, and too political. It is also the weakest in the series. But Stallone's done a lot worse. Rocky 4 is a testament to the fact that sometimes entertainment is all that's required, and the film doesn't need to enlighten."

","Rocky IV is the best of all the Rocky films.  Granted, Rocky III was good with the fight scenes between Sly and Mr. T, but Rocky II was simply Sly training for a rematch with Apollo Creed and Rocky V was just predictable. The best scene in the film is the final battle between Rocky and Drago. Rocky enters the arena in Moscow with thousands of Russian spectators booing him, but when Drago enters, they play this sound over the loudspeakers that sounds like an air raid siren, and then we hear the playing of the Soviet national anthem (they had some very good singers in that crowd).  When they play the anthem, you just can't help but stand up and be caught in the moment.<br/><br/>Perhaps Sly and Brigiette Nielsen's marriage didn't last long because she always had eyes for Dolph Lundgren."

","If you have not seen this film (and I don't know how you cold not have) STOP READING HERE!! Now I can get down to business. Plain and simple this movie was made because Sylvester Stallone realized he had a good thing going and certainly you want to milk the cow as long as it's still giving milk. (Cow was obviously dry for Rocky V) And this movie was moving along just fine until our buddy Sly made that fatal error (no pun intended) by allowing a certain character to disappear for good in the series. (AC played by CW) Seriously though, What were you thinking Sly? I have loved the ""Rocky"" films since I was a wee lad, but it was not until I saw the fourth installment that I finally realized the truth. I was'nt watching because of Rocky Balboa, I was watching because of Apollo Creed. Really. Let's be honest here-his character (played brilliantly AND flawlessly by the great Carl Weathers) is the focal point in every film in the series. One-Without him there is no title fight and the movie would suck. Two-Without him there is no rematch and the movie would suck. Three-Without him Rocky gives up after first fight with Lang and the movie would suck. Four-Without him there is no reason for Rock to fight Russian and movie would suck. And Five-Without him movie does suck!! When you look at the five true series regulars (Stallone, Shire, Young, Weathers and Meredith) the only one without Weathers is by far the worst-big suprise there. So you can see where I am going here. And Stallone has to make Creed's disappearance even more embarassing by making him look, in his fight against Drago, like the only thing that got him in the fight in the first place was a pulse. Come on I know the fight was supposed to be one-sided but you would have sworn Apollo had never fought before in his life. Maybe he could only punch 700 psi but that would still hurt I imagine. On the other side punching 2000 psi would certainly kill anybody-including you Rocky and probably even sooner. The point here is you allowed the wonderful Apollo Creed's exit from the series to be a pretty feeble one Sly, and I will never forgive you for that. Rest of movie-Rock gets mad-Rock trains-Rock fights Russian-Rock wins (whatever) with Russian people cheering for USA (whatever) and everyone goes home happy (again, whatever). So as a fan let me say ""I'm sorry Carl-it is obvious you deserved a more glorious demise but that might have made you outshine your buddy Sly once more. And I'm sure both of us realize why his ego never could have let that happen!!"

","I don't know what possessed me to comment on Rocky IV. Oh wait! IT IS AWESOME! This is my favorite in the series. Don't get me wrong, I love them all, but this one ultimately stands out as where the character ""Rocky"" (Sylvester Stallone) goes from a great fighter to a legend. This film is a tremendous kaleidoscope of action, drama and entertainment.<br/><br/>
If you have seen the previous Rocky films (which I recommend as well), you will remember Rocky's greatest rival Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), who is a brash and outlandish fighter who will remind you of a young Muhammad Ali. However, now since that they have earned each others friendship and respect, they are now on the same side against a common enemy: Ivan Drago, the top amateur fighter from Russia. Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) is an impressive sight at nearly seven-feet in height. Apollo Creed is the first to get a crack at Drago, and is ultimately defeated to the point of death in the ring. Now the film gets serious. The film uses terrific music & video montages to show what Rocky is thinking.<br/><br/>Either its friendship or patriotism combined with a little ego that forces Rocky to lay down a challenge as well. However he demands the fight to take place in Moscow, Russia on Christmas Day, using the most basic circumstances of training.<br/><br/>To feel a little patriotic is an understatment as you see the differences and ethics in methods of training. Ivan Drago trains in the most comfortable gymnasiums and uses state-of-the-art equipment, as well as taking large doses of anabolic steroids. This is proven by his dramatic increases of power as he goes from 700 to over 2,000 pounds of pressure in ONE PUNCH! Rocky trains by running in the snow and up mountains, by chopping logs, lifting large sacks of rocks and pulling wagons. By the time of the fight, both men are in incredible condition, and the only thing that will prove victorious is who has the most heart and desire.<br/><br/>You can't get much more influential elements to stroke the American ego than those included in this movie. Basically simple: USA vs. RUSSIA on their own turf in a complete gutter war. Its the Clash Of The Super Powers during the last years of the bitter Cold War."
"Brian-272","7","0","0","1 January 2001"," A powerful classic. The most popular Rocky movie but ranks second in terms of quality behind the original Rocky. This fourth installment has a touch of Ronald Reagan.
","Since 1985 when I first watched Rocky IV in the theater then the many video viewings to watching it countless times on TV until finally buying a VHS copy five years ago with every watch this movie really uplifts me! I know that the boxing action and fight scenes in this Rocky are unrealistic it's like playing a video game with the sounds the punches make! People by now had come to love Rocky for the hearts and souls that his underdog performances touch and the lack of fight realism doesn't bother them. This installment is a very tragic and war like for Rocky when super boxer and fighting machine Russian Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) makes his arrival to the United States and first off he beats the life out of Rocky friend and former rival ex-champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) after Apollo's death we see the most determined Rocky ever as it's off to The Soviet Union to train! Rocky finds himself fighting for Apollo's spirit but also Old Glory! It's us against them. I must say the best done parts and uplifting parts of this movie are the training scenes which show the contrast between both Drago and Rocky it is displayed perfect in a brilliant montage that clashes the images together of Rocky's slogging through hip-deep snow while Drago has ultra-tech workouts. I know Drago has the best Soviet science and medicine and biomechanical makings of a champion but the blue-collar type training and determination of Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) is the old-fashioned way we Americans not only love but want to do and be proud to be an American! The music played during this montage and also really throughout the entire film is so uplifting it forced me to buy The Rocky Story Soundtrack. The following songs ""No Easy Way Out"", ""Hearts On Fire"", and ""Burning Heart"" really helped influence my life they all are great motivational songs for anything you do in life. When the bell rings, the war begins! Rocky proves a heart can beat a merciless machine. After the victory Rocky's message to the Soviet Union crowd is important he thanks the crowd and says most important of all if I can change you can change we all can change thanks and god bless! If you remember 1985 when this film was released you remember the tensions that our country and then President Ronald Reagan had to deal with. That is why I say this film had a touch of Ronald Reagan. Thankfully the tensions with Russia dissolved and Stallone got his wish even if it was years later. Once again great supporting performances were given by Talia Shire and Burt Young they always help Rocky deliver that powerful punch. Rocky IV continues to get numerous airings on cable channels TBS and TNT but I'm sure most have watched this numerous times this film just has that special feel present that not only makes you proud to be an American but also live life to your best with the most determination. Rocky IV is the second best in the series the 1976 original is the best due to it's sentimental start of a nobody who made a legend but Rocky IV gives you the action that the legend (Rocky) should give back to his fans. Great film one of the best ever!"

","Since the original Rocky (1976), there has been an ever increasing amount of cheese throughout the subsequent installments.

The burning heart and There's No Easy Way Out are undoubted favourites in boxing gyms today. When this is combined with the customary training montage...

"kevbury","Null","0","0","30 November 2000"," A Great Movie
","What makes this movie so great is that it captured our fears and hopes all at the same time. In a way by watching this movie we were in our own way fighting against our Russian adversaries. As far as the historical accuracy goes we must remember that this is just a movie. As with all the ROCKY movies the boxing matches go on far longer than they would in real life. In this movie we saw the Soviet Training system as a finely regimented and scientific endeavour. According to Soviet sports training books I have read the kinds of training depicted in the movie may very well be accurate. There are only two things that may be a stretch. The first is the use of sparring partners by Drago. The movie depicts Drago pummelling every one of his partners sending them to the canvas spitting up blood. This of course doesn't happen in real life-sparring partners are partners not punching bags. The second thing about Drago's training that is questionable is his use of steroids in the movie. Contrary to popular belief this was not a wide spread practice and in fact it was condemed by the government. Any athlete who was caught doing steriods or any coach who distributed them were eliminated from the sports program. Soviet scientists and trainers knew that the use of steroids only provided a quick boost in strength, and that continued use of them would cause extensive injuries to the athlete. In short the athlete would be injured so much that he would have been able to train harder and acheive maximum performance without the drugs. In the movie's defence though, the scene is relevant in the context that we all thought the Soviets were taking superior drugs thus adding to our fear of them.<br/><br/>This movie definitely displayed our thoughts and emotions dealing with the Cold War right up to the very end. Our sentiments were captured exactly when after the fight Rocky said, ""Tonight you had two people killing each other...but I guess that's better than 20 million"". ""If I can change and if you can change...everyone can change""... We changed."

Aside from this bias though, ROCKY 4 is definitely an improvement on the other two previous sequels, which is a blessed relief. Dolph Lundgren makes the perfect mis-interpreted villain in an early, pre-Hollywood come-down role. Stallone is also excellent in the title role, and Carl Weathers bows out spectacularly.<br/><br/>A silly storyline and some rather close-to-the-bone references to the Cold War make this popcorn fodder rather than the moving biography of the first film, but it is to be enjoyed nonetheless."

","This movie is in my opinion, the greatest of the Rocky Trilogy. And I think the critics who bad mouthed this movie were ticked that the Rocky plotlines weren't what is called ""A Work Of Art"" such as Rocky 1 and 2. The plot lines in the Rocky movies shifted in Rocky 3, and got to be more interesting, because he wasn't some guy living in a slum boxing with an old man after part 2, which the critics thought was ""Arthouse Greatness""<br/><br/>
Anyways, this movie has a great conflict in it. The at the time, U.S.S.R. was trying to make it's way into sports, by enginnering Dolph Lundgren with steroids and high-tech exercize equipment, which I thought was pretty interesting. And Rocky, as usual, trains the old school way, by old fashoned boxing and strength gaining methods. <br/><br/>The movie I think was made to teach a point at that time. If you notice when Drago begins to lose the match, and notice he isn't as strong as what he thought, he gains some respect for Rocky. <br/><br/>The ending is a little impossible, and wierd, yes.

(Rocky's all heart you know; you can see it in the way he trains, helping out those poor Russians by pulling their ploughs; Drago by using some sorta boxing based technology, well, that's just cheating isn't it?!!?) Fight night; Rocky takes his usual pounding; but wait he's not going to give up; he's making a comeback of some kind; wow, the Russian crowd for some strange reason are backing Rocky (please explain why even when Creed was losing in the US they still backed him but here it is different); Rocky's beaten the Russian killer; Cue Rocky's victor speech ... ""Can't we all get along guys? Please? Addrriiiaann."" OK the storyline may not have changed much from the other Rocky's (Rocky=underdog; fights big monster; losing but comes back to win etc etc), I might not agree with the naive political outlook of the film and the film has possibly the worst montage sequence in any film I've watched (it just goes on and on), but this film really is great for sitting down to with some friends ... the cheese is present in massive amounts and although it is just that little bit cynical you just can't help but poke fun at it every 5 minutes as opposed to getting up and turn it off.<br/><br/>On a quizzical note I can't understand what Drago's character is supposed to be exactly. It seems like he is/should be set up as a pretty much 2d monster/ punch bag for the audience but I got a sense of vulnerability/ that he was merely being used by his trainers at the first press conference and at the very end. Trashy motivational music is amazing; in that it does its job ... its big, loud, (terrible) and makes you wanna go out and, well, kick some ass really (see Hearts On Fire, Sweetest Victory et al).<br/><br/>In all a weak rehash, definitely worth a look though if you have a streak of cynicism running through you (make sure whoever your watching it does too!) or maybe if you just want something 'up-lifting'."

","This movie continues the saga of Rocky Balboa and Apollo Creed. Creed is getting older by now and starting to feel washed up, so when a fresh, new boxer (Ivan Drago) announces his intention to compete for the world heavyweight title, Creed sees it as his chance to prove to everyone that he's still ""got it."" <br/><br/>Creed's reasoning is ludicrous, as are a lot of the arguments that take place in this movie. Evidently Drago is big sensation in Russia and a gold medalist and amateur champion to boot. Yet NOBODY in the United States seems to know anything about the guy. Of course, this movie takes place back when the Russian were the ""bad guys"", so maybe we just weren't paying much attention to their athletes since we were so worried about getting nuked by their leaders. <br/><br/>The match between Creed and Drago will be an exhibition match, which opens with James Brown signing and performing with a bunch of dancers in flashy costumes. The bewildered look on Drago's face as all this is going on is kind of funny. The match only lasts into the 2nd round - at which point the Russian beats Apollo Creed so badly that Apollo dies in the ring. Bet you didn't see THAT coming, did you? <br/><br/>This makes Rocky understandably upset, so he decides to challenge the Russian. Ah, but there's a catch - the match will be fought in Russia! Why? Because, according to Drago's spooky-looking Russian wife, Drago has been receiving death threats for beating Apollo Creed's head in and killing him and whatnot. Drago and his technologically-advanced training entourage pack up and go back to Russia to prepare for the fight, which will take place on Christmas day. <br/><br/>Rocky decides to train in Russia too, and it's at this point in the movie where we see the contrast between Rocky's training style and the Russian's. While Drago relies on the latest machines, performance-enhancing drugs, and computer monitoring devices, Rocky gets in shape the old-fashioned way - by running around in the snow, cutting down trees, doing countless sit-ups, and climbing mountains. <br/><br/>Anyhow, the fight comes and of course the crowd is all for Drago. But that little guy from Philly eventually starts to win over the crowd as he continues, in true Rocky style, to stay on his feet despite getting knocked silly by the overpowering Drago. Finally, by the end of the match the 99% Russia crowd is chanting ""Rocky! Rocky!"" as they watch their own Drago start to slip and get worn down by Rocky. This is probably the most ridiculous moment in the movie, as there is NO WAY this would happen, particularly in the early 1980's when the rift between the Soviet Union and the United States was arguably at its peak. <br/><br/>Of course, Rocky wins (sorry if that spoils the story for anyone) and ends up giving this self-important speech to the Russian crowd about ""change.""

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","2","5","16 May 2015"," An equal to Rocky III (1982) but for some different reasons
","It's interesting how fate works. Sometimes it seems like no matter how hard someone tries to move on from his or her current state, just can't cut a break. A few people may believe that it is a calling of higher purpose. Something of which an individual cannot or try to escape. After three prior entrees, it feels as if Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) can't find a way to unbind himself from his boxing roots. There were some words thrown around in Rocky II (1979) and the seed was finally planted in Rocky III (1982) after losing Mickey. Once Clubber Lang was defeated, it seemed as if Rocky was decisively taking a step down from his lucrative pastime or so he thought.<br/><br/>Enter Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren in his first starring role), the heavy weight boxing champion of Soviet Russia. A man of few words whose height towers among many and has a penetrating stare. Believing that his opponent should only be Balboa, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) steps in first to face Drago. Sadly, Creed underestimates Drago and dies in an exhibition match. Looking to avenge his long time friend, Rocky decides to take the rematch to mother Russia himself. And right when Balboa thought he was about done! This installment again retains a number of key elements that help made the original such a hit but just as well misses in areas too. Once again Stallone is credited as writer/director of which this time keeps most of the direction focused this time. Unlike Rocky III (1982) which focused on the glam of fame, this chapter returns to what made Rocky likable and that's his family, friends and how he interacts with others.<br/><br/>Although the run time is shorter than the predecessors are, the chemistry between all the characters felt more equal than Rocky III (1982). Burt Young as Paulie still has his funny lines and Talia Shire as Adrian shows her concern for the people she cares about. Audiences even get to see Rocky interact with his son this time! For Carl Weathers, as his last appearance in the series is great to watch too. There is one specific scene where Balboa addresses Creed about him fighting Drago and whether it is worth it. The words exchanged feel meaningful and put the situation into the right perspective. Some may think otherwise though because Lundgren's character has very little to say. However, when looking at Drago from the perspective of which he grew up in, it's not like his training real gave him a reason to say much. He was trained to win and winning was all he knew. However, this does not excuse these other particularly questionable areas in the film.<br/><br/>An example of this are two montage scenes that are supposed to be throwbacks to the past films but it's done in such a random order than it doesn't quite work. With that, the scenes feel like filler, making viewers feel like they're beginning to waste their time. Another thing that doesn't make much sense is Creed's motivation to fight Ivan Drago. Didn't Creed remember what happened to Balboa when he was so eager to fight Clubber Lang from the previous entry? When you make haste without thinking or preparing, serious consequences may come your way. Creed knows this, so why did he not remember it? The whole USA vs USSR backdrop makes sense but again, why didn't Creed prepare properly for the match? His decision was rash and it cost him dearly. Wouldn't it have been more effective (emotionally) if Rocky and Creed prepared and then Creed lost? Wouldn't that be more heartbreaking? This is something Stallone could've included in his script but (obviously) wasn't used.<br/><br/>Another aspect that is sorely lacking is the musical score. This time the music was composed by Vince DiCola (best known for The Transformers: The Movie (1986) score). This was also DiCola's first entry in the film score profession. To say that it's bad is unnecessary. In fact, DiCola actually uses the Rocky and training montage theme in his score; the problem is he doesn't utilize it to its fullest capacity. Instead, the themes are hinted at only briefly. Other than that, the rest of the tunes belong to synth orchestration, which doesn't really fit the Rocky series except for the occasional pop song. With Bill Conti's signature piano, string and horn absent there aren't enough instruments for the audience to get attached to per scene. Even the emotional scenes aren't as effective as they could've been because the score doesn't match. However, the film isn't devoid of entertainment. The fight scenes are still lively. Lundgren and Stallone really throw the punches in this entry. Plus cinematography by again Bill Butler worked at its job. Once you do a certain job for so long you end not having to change much. Butler has maintained a consistent look in the Rocky series and he hasn't disappointed yet.<br/><br/>This entry is fairly equal to Rocky III (1982), it just has problems in other areas. The writing and direction is a tad better which focuses more on its characters than it does fame and glory and Dolph Lundgren's debut is nothing short of good entertainment. However, it still suffers from unnecessary scenes, a contradictory motivation for Creed and a disappointing musical score, which unfortunately lacked the Bill Conti touch."

","Rocky 4 has Rocky fighting his most powerful opponent yet the Russian hulk Ivan Drago. Drago has killed Apollo Creed in an exhibition match and Rocky wants revenge. <br/><br/>Unfortunately whilst the plot is OK, unfortunately it swaps any drama for too many video montages. The generic American rock soundtrack is dreadful and adds nothing to the film. Along with this there are some pretty terrible stereotypes and some crass scenes.<br/><br/>For all it's flaws this still manages to entertain and the bottom line is this is it's purpose. The fight scenes are as brutal as ever and the Drago V Creed fight is really well done. <br/><br/>For Rocky fans this is still a good nights entertainment."

","Loved this sequel when I was a child, however time has not been nice to this film, as it has become more riddled with flaws with each passing view. This is Sly's worst film, written or otherwise. Well, his acting is on par, but not great.<br/><br/>A major flaw, I believe, is how they minimized Ivan Drago to a mere caricature of himself with no personal history or character development. It did make it easier to hate the Russian and also made it easier to like Rocky. In fact, it's a ridiculous habit this series has throughout. I felt like there was history trying to be shown in Drago's character (new trainer in, old trainer out), but they wanted a cartoon instead of a movie with guts. <br/><br/>A cheap exploitation on over-ratcheted feelings during the end of the Cold War.<br/><br/>But it all gets so much worse...<br/><br/>It can not be forgiven that a boxer would throw a referee to the floor before the bell, keep hitting his opponent after the bell--and still win the fight! There has never been place in time where that is even remotely possible. Yet, it is written. How is this? How is it that Rocky just sat there like a baby and did not even get physical with Ivan Drago? That is not possible, for it is completely out of sync with the subtext of Rocky's rage ""switch,"" as developed in the first three sequels. In life, it would have been a me-lay. In the case of Rocky, it needed to be as such. It was a must. All respect is lost for him after this.<br/><br/>By now, the characters are all clichés of themselves; the montages are all ridiculously cheesy and time consuming (for a reason; substance). It is just very bad. What is worse is how superficial and void this film is. When Rocky takes off in his Ferrari after Creed's death, the cinematographer has no problem stealing a few shots of the Ferrari's badge plate. So, they could not even do Apollo's death justice with a decent montage. <br/><br/>This stuff matters when millions of dollars are invested in a motion picture. To me it does, anyway. If they do not have the conviction of their own material, why should I respect it?<br/><br/>This movie was an excuse to show off Stallone's new nose job and body build.<br/><br/>Fails on most accounts."

It's one of the movies that watching it equals not watching it!<br/><br/>This is, to its date, the most un-needed, pointless and silly Rocky movie. I can tell the story of it in maybe 5 seconds, and it won't amuse you either. Simply what makes the movie, any movie, is its conflict. This one got none. There is no character development, astonishing moment or even a good dialogue. It adds nothing to the character but a brain tumor. It adds nothing to the Russians but the same old stereotyping. And it adds nothing to us but a stupid waste of time!<br/><br/>So smart to make your opponent that inhuman. I was laughing, originally knowing that it's impossible to watch Rocky, as Mr. America, getting beaten by that Russian robot, and in the highest of the cold war's days. Hence it's dumbly predictable as well!<br/><br/>The performance hit a new degree of goofiness. For little instance, (Dolph Lundgren), who would be a master of uncountable V movies later, didn't do anything that bad in his entire life.<br/><br/>Specking about goofiness; look at (Stallone)'s little speech to the Russians at the end. And if you didn't like it, watch him wiping them off the face of the earth, 3 years later, in Rambo III. Now I know why (Ronald Reagan) loved being called Rambo, not Rocky!<br/><br/>But even if, (Stallone), as a writer / director / star of the show, wanted Rocky to go east, to do what he had to do, teaching these communists a lesson, yet with class, assuring his message of peace (and I mean the sport's one, Not America's!). However, just the characterization of the Russians assures how *objective* and *peace loving* (Stallone) was from the start!<br/><br/>The movie's elements got nothing remarkable. I didn't find something to enjoy, rather to watch. It's pretty average, and with the mentality of it, as a commercial movie or a message one, it's weak and useless. By the way, it's my first time ever to call a movie useless. But this one earns it!"

Up until the point when Rocky and his family arrives in Russia this film was alright, but thereafter that scene this movie became dull and boring.<br/><br/>Not only I found this film boring, but I found the storyline completely ridiculous for there is no way that Rocky Balboa (The Italian Stallion) could have possibly defeated a powerhouse musclebound freak like Ivan Drago. If Ivan Drago was strong enough to kill Apollo Creed in the ring than there is no way that Rocky Balboa could have possibly beaten Ivan Drago. In fact, he's lucky to have even survived the fight.<br/><br/>As a Rocky fan, i've enjoyed all the films except parts 2 and 4 but if you haven't seen parts 2 and 4 I recommend you to watch them anyway because although they were boring films, you need to watch them in order to understand where the next Rocky sequel is coming from."

","* out of ****<br/><br/>The  fourth installment in the Rocky series is, in almost every respect, the pits. It is in overblown concoction of bad acting, bad writing, and bad directing. It's really a musical, with an occasional, poorly written scene that merely recycles plot points from the earlier movies, because there's a new song playing every five minutes, whether it's playing over Rocky driving his high priced car or being performed by James Brown. Imagine James Brown performing in the original Rocky. Through all this though, Carl Weathers manages to give a high energy performance, once more, as Apollo Creed. Besides Carl Weathers, there are no other notable performances. Poor Burt Young, who once brought humor to the franchise, has been reduced to political mumbo jumbo. The final fight between Rocky and the super Soviet Ivan Drago is the only part of the movie well executed, but at the same time is wholly unbelievable. When I say final fight, that does not include the few minutes following the fight, for that my friends will make you cringe. During the "" No Easy Way Out"" montage, clips from the previous Rocky movies are shown. This is the saddest part of the movie because it makes the viewer realize how much they used to care for these characters, before the Rocky franchise became a formulaic, money making machine."

","In the pantheon of Rocky films, this fourth installment has received both high praise and much malignment. It seems as if you either love it or hate it, with no middle ground. To me, this film not only succeeds, but succeeds on two different levels: Cold War analogy, and present-day boxing environment.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Rocky IV"" sees former champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) trying to make a comeback against the freakishly large Russian newcomer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). When Creed fails in the attempt to win the East-West battle, the task falls to Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone).<br/><br/>The first level this film succeeds on is the Cold War analogy. This theme obviously played much better in 1985, but it still resonates to this day. It works because, on only one occasion (in Rocky's final speech), does it descend into sappiness. Otherwise, it tries not to make too much of a political statement.<br/><br/>However, if you don't buy into the Cold War angle, this movie still holds up well as a mirror of the current boxing culture. With the Klitschko brothers ruling the heavyweight division with their powerful blows that mask their glass chins (just like Drago), they have booted any American challengers from the top spots. This is probably just a lucky coincidence on director Stallone's part, but perhaps he can be given some credit for a bit of foresight.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that CAN be enjoyed, despite the objections of many. It takes a bit more suspension of reality than its predecessors to enjoy, but if you can buy in to the drama and spectacle, you will be cheering when the credits roll."

Most of them I've seen are just two overweight guys that throw a couple punches and then grab a hold of the other man mostly because they are out of shape and exhausted by the end of round one. No wonder UFC has taken over! But in the Rocky movies (especially this one) the two combatants beat the stuffing out of each other. One roundhouse punch lands after the next. Totally unrealistic, but so is just about everything else in Rocky IV.<br/><br/>Stallone is back as usual and apparently comfortably retired after taking out Mr. T in the previous installment. Only after his once rival and now friend Apollo Crede is killed by a seemingly indestructible Russian boxer, Rocky must come back and avenge not only Apollo, but the pride of the United States! It was 1985! The Cold War was as hot as ever, and the only good Russian as far as we were concerned was.... well, those were the days. The Russian, known as Ivan Draggo, is wonderfully played by Swedish ""actor"" Dolph Lundgren. And boy does he look the part! Genetically engineered by top Soviet scientists, he is perhaps super-human. And his wife is a total icy witch played by Stallone's babe of the moment, Danish model and now reality star Brigitte Nielsen. All she does is look on with pride as Draggo trains, and scowl at Adrian as it appears her husband is destroying Rocky in the ring. And the actors portraying the other Russians are as cold and evil as ever! To top it all off, the final fight will be in Moscow! Does Rocky have a chance??? I wonder.<br/><br/>Despite being a very entertaining movie, there are some really cheesy moments that should have been left out. Paulie's robotic birthday present is probably the worst. The scene where the robot is introduced is so awful, it was even parodied on Family Guy. How about the never-ending music montages whenever Rocky is either training, or just driving around at night in a state of angst? The soundtrack is one lame, slick tune after another. There are some good songs by Survivor on there though! The final fight is quite a spectacle, but some really dumb things happen while it is going on. First of all, the crowd begins to support Rocky! As if! Any hint of support for him in real life would have meant a life-long banishment to the gold mines of Kolyma, or worse! And how about the scene where Draggo throws a Soviet suit out of the ring and declares he fights, ""FOR ME!!!!"" No chance. And how about the KGB minders who follow Rocky around when he's jogging? I think one of them might have been Vladomir Putin! He was KGB about that time. Still probably is! Anyway, the film made an absolute fortune.

","There's some highly memorable lines and moments in there as well, such as the scene where Drago's punching power is measured, and the chilling moment where Drago utters to Creed ""You will lose."" Some of the dialogue is so preposterous, however, that you'll probably find yourself laughing, particularly towards the end where Drago discovers that he isn't the iron man he thought he was.<br/><br/>Yep, it's trashy, but it's damn good fun. The boxing scenes are as unrealistic and silly as ever (As if the Russian spectators in the final boxing match would end up cheering for Drago's opponent, and AS IF you would hear those loud clumping noises every time a punch is thrown!), but Sylveser Stallone is always watchable as the simple but likable boxer, whilst Dolph Lundren has probably never been on better form. Following the death of Apollo Creed, there's a wonderfully directed moment in the movie where, with no dialogue at all, the eyes of Both Drago and Rocky meet for several seconds - This tiny sequence alone sort of spells out what the rest of the movie is going to be about! There's plenty of steroetyping in there too (Look at the way the Russians are portrayed), and Talia Shire is as miserable and irritable as ever as Rocky's put-on wife. The usual support is back in there too in the form of Burt Young and the amazing Brigette Neilson, and, believe it or not, much can be said for Stallone's direction; he may not be too worried about realism or plot, but when it comes to exciting and entertaining his audience, he really is something quite special."

Once doughy and poorly dressed, now chiseled, heavily altered by plastic surgery, and losing touch with his meager beginnings as he drowns in money. He is brash and jumps into ill-advised decisions. However, he does so based on what he believes is right and, most importantly, he doesn't know how to quit (despite the fact that he's running headlong toward brain damage). The Soviet Union is represented by a juiced-up monster with a blonde flat-top. He's an automaton, easily confused by the things going on around him and borderline frightened of James Brown. Watch the movie and tell me they didn't fully intend for Ivan Drago to be Frankenstein. Tell me you aren't constantly worried someone will strike a match and send him into a mindless rampage. It is also fairly clear that Ludmilla (Brigitte Nielsen) is the Bride of Frankenstein, genetically engineered to be his identical female counterpart, complete with blonde flat-top. This brings us to the secondary theme that runs throughout the film.<br/><br/>Number Three: Man vs. Machine. Soviet Frankenstein is constantly surrounded by a team of scientists and technicians as he trains in a gym full of cutting-edge equipment and is injected with what we would assume are anabolic steroids. Ivan Drago has been constructed by his government according to a carefully devised plan. Meanwhile, Balboa dials it back to his roots in the best training montage of the Rocky series. Running through the snow while being chased by bumbling KGB agents, using stones and wooden carts and even his friends as resistance; all he lacks is a frozen side of beef to pound into oblivion. Also falling into this category is a ridiculously awesome birthday gift: Paulie's ""pleasure bot."" Robots were huge in the 80's and this one made quite an impression on me. This thing was apparently a genuine, operational robot named SICO, a member of SAG, and toured with James Brown after the movie was released. I'm not joking. My favorite moment with the robot is during the finale. Rocky's son wasn't brought along to Moscow for the fight. Rocky, Paulie, and Adrian are all in Russia. So, if you'll notice, the Balboas apparently felt so good about the robot, they left it alone to watch their son and his friends. But, it looks like the kids (and SICO) are having a good time, so who can complain?<br/><br/>Number Four: Balboa Triggers the Collapse of Communism. Mark it down: Rocky IV got the ball rolling. This film was released in November, 1985. The moment Rocky cuts Drago and turns the entire Russian crowd against their own freakish cyborg and over to his side (including Fake Gorbachev), a groundswell had begun that couldn't be reversed. Four years later, in November, 1989, the Berlin Wall comes down. Coincidence? Hardly. So, remember the words that started it all: ""During this fight... I seen a lot of changing. The way you felt about me...and the way I felt about you. In here...there were two guys... killing each other. But I guess that's better than a million. What I'm trying to say is... if I can change... and you can change... everybody can change!""<br/><br/>By Scott Stafford more VHessays to come at www.walksoftlyfilms.com"
"mountaindrew17","9","1","2","7 December 2009"," Rocky IV is Awesome!
","Rock IV is a great movie. I like the plot and how the suspense is built so high in the end with the Russian and Rocky. I would say that this is one of the best 3 out of all of the Rocky series. What I like about all of the Rocky movies is that Rocky Balboa never wins easily. He always has to give it 110% as long as he can. And once he stops, he starts to get pummeled. For example, when he boxed with the Russian. He would get his ass canned but when he shifts gears, he'll make a big comeback. Then he'll get tired and the Russian boxer would beat on him again. The fights are always so close, that no matter how many times you watch the movies, you'll still fall for the suspense! And that's what I like about the Rocky Balboa IV film."

","Lots of really bad eighties music here - I happen to like a lot of eighties music, but in this film the music is really bad, nothing at all like ""eye of the tiger"" - the fighting sequences resemble more of a regular action film fight (realism is down low). Come on; a 16 rounds fight of heavyweight, with both boxers throwing nothing but knockout-punches? A cramped place full of Russians, maybe five Americans including Rocky and his team?! And the Russians actually ending up cheering Rocky?! What crap.<br/><br/>But I still enjoyed the movie! It's Rocky - never give up, never surrender, eye of the tiger (and the Russian Bull!), THE BEST training sequences so far of the four films, well, I was still sitting like glued to the screen, enjoying my ass off!

","This is my favorite Rocky movie by far! Mainly because this movie has the most action.<br/><br/>Here's a short summary...Rocky is back on top when he defeats Mr. T in Rocky III, and it begins with a very big, muscular Russian boxer named Ivan Drago comes to America and challenges Rocky.<br/><br/>I thought the story was excellent and the acting great. Dolph Lundgren was born for the role of Ivan Drago by far. I had chills every time I saw him! <br/><br/>The Boxing fights seemed very real and also very exciting, i felt like I was watching a real boxing match every time! I highly recommend you see this movie."
"crukeg","7","1","2","26 June 2007"," Rocky is fighting for his country. All together now ""ROCKY,ROCKY""
","I thought this was generally cool. Sly Stallone was great. This time he's fighting a Russian that killed his friend in the ring. This character is accompanied by a group of hilarious 1-dimensional characters that suggest he is stronger than the average American tank. It sounds silly, but Stallone gloraphies the international issues surounding the fighters, which gives the viewer a strange political message.<br/><br/>The fight was deliciously ridiculous. Rocky is not fighting a man, but a machine. The punches are too loud, and the editing is sloppy, but hey it still gets the adreneline going.<br/><br/>What bugged me was the music. what happened to the sincere score of the first? It was filled to the rim withexcruiciating songs that i'dexpect to hear in a bad episode of pokemon. <br/><br/>Having said this, I enjoyed it for what it was, a fight movie, little intelligence, but glossy and nutty for a reason. <br/><br/>Campy fun!"
"Robert_duder","9","1","2","9 January 2007"," Truly astounding continuation of the remarkable series
","Rocky IV is an incredible film and completely makes the series worth while. Not only that Rocky IV encompassed such an important message for the time it was made in. It only made sense for America's greatest underdog hero to take on America's most feared opponent...Russia. And Dolph Lundgren completely carried the weight of being Russia and pulled it off brilliantly becoming what I think was Rocky's hands down best adversary. Rocky IV featured more of and better scenes of what made the Rocky series great. Hands down Rocky IV had the best musical montage training scene in the winter scape of Russia, it also had the brutal match between Rocky and the Russian which was the best of his fights without a doubt. It had emotion and death losing one of the great characters from the Rocky series.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone once again for the third time directs, writes and takes the lead role as Rocky Balboa. Now Stallone has proved numerous times that he can direct and write and yes even act but especially when it comes to Rocky. Nobody knows Rocky Balboa the way Stallone does and I think he does an incredible job of really capturing Rocky at a turning point in his life. His best friend is dead, killed in the ring with Rocky watching, his mentor is gone, his wife doesn't understand him, he has all these riches and is unsatisfied with his career and his life thus far which drives him back to the ring on the other side of the world to prove his strength. Stallone is very emotional and almost moody and quiet as he drives himself against his greatest opponent in a nation that hates him. And finally Stallone looks incredible!! When he finally gets in that ring opposite an equally impressive looking Lundgren Stallone looks built like a rock, the best he's ever looked before or since. The original crew returns once again including the short lived Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed who holds nothing back in his brief yet flamboyant and loud performance as always. Taila Shire as Rocky's wife Adrian who once again for the second time doesn't get as big of a part but she is still vital to the story as she comes around to Rocky's cause and reasons for fighting. And Burt Young returns in his unstoppably hilarious and important role as Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law and friend. They have some very emotional moments together in this film. New to the cast is lovely but very hard looking Brigitte Nielsen (the future real life Mrs. Stallone for two years) as Ivan Drago's wife and promoter. Her hard steely glares and Russian accent makes her the perfect voice to Drago's physical presence. And as mentioned before cult favorite actor Dolph Lundgren is Captain Ivan Drago, the monstrous man who is destroying everything in his path. Lundgren has very, very few lines but the lines he delivers become instant classic ""If he dies...he dies,"" and my favorite ""I must crush you."" Lundgren easily looks frightening and towers over Stallone and is impressive to watch fight and train. He plays his role to perfection and is the best Rocky opponent period!! <br/><br/>Stallone directs the final battle to absolute perfection. The crowd that boos him and then slowly turns, his moving and politically important speech at the end, and the absolutely damaging blasts Rocky takes from the drug induced pumped up Drago. This film is the reason Rocky after Rocky film has been made because great sequels can be done. I still feel that Rocky IV was aiming more mainstream than the original two but nonetheless it is a terrific film and an absolute eighties classic. You can't see any Rocky without seeing them all but this is worth while!! 9/10"
"bbresner","10","1","2","27 November 2006"," I will break you
","The best of the series, rocky IV is the greatest for many reasons: the training montage, the ridiculous ""rocky ending the cold war"" theme, the fact you see Adrienne less than the other ones, apollo's death, duke training Balboa.... I could go on and on.<br/><br/>I rank them this way:<br/><br/>1) Rocky IV 2) Rocky III 3) Rocky II 4) Rocky I 5) Let's pretend Rocky V never happened, but I'm strangely excited for Rocky 6 with antonio tarver.<br/><br/>And rocky gets absolutely shredded in this one, best training scenes by far for the workhorse American vs. the genetic (and dirty) freak Russian. Dolph Lungren will always have a place in my heart for this one."
"MaximusXXX","7","1","2","23 August 2006"," Great Action Film
","This is one of my favourites, a film I have literally seen 100+ times. I won't however go and say this is 10/10, I give it an 8. The training montages in this film are quite grand. Being 3/4 Russian myself I believe the film does a fairly good job of presenting the Soviet Union. Of course no matter the outcome a Soviet crowd would not cheer for the American opponent, but, nonetheless. The action was very well done for the final fight. In true Rocky spirit, there has to be something that forces Rocky to fight for his life.<br/><br/>The first film is obviously about Rocky's one in a million chance.<br/><br/>The second is for pride, and to get himself and his family out of a hard spot.<br/><br/>The third is about Rocky's fighting spirit.<br/><br/>The fourth is for his friend, Apollo, who the Russian fighter, Ivan Drago kills in the 2nd Round.<br/><br/>Overall a great film, I recommend it."
"Jonny-Utah","8","1","2","12 May 2006"," my first release of adrenaline!
","Critics often refer to Rocky IV as being one of the worst of the series, but I remember going to the odeon cinema November 1985 as a 7 year old with the worst cold ever and coming out 90 minutes later oblivious of my illness. Never have I witnessed a film get so much involvement from an audience as this one(inc me). People were leaping out of their chairs throwing air punches and willing Rocky to win, like you might expect from a real boxing match!! Contrary to critics unnecessary remarks about the films social comment, what sly cleverly did was create possibly his greatest money-spinner.At that time he was at the height of his popularity,everyone already loved the character so he took these factors and used them to great effect to create a winning formula pitting Rocky against an invincible opponent, not only that but a Russian one at a time when America was fragile and needed inspiration to look to with all the goings on of the cold war. So he tapped into the peoples zeitgeist - winning ingredient number one.<br/><br/>Secondly he took Rockys best loved friend Apollo and had him killed off by the deadly russkie. Having this advertised on the trailer was a masterstroke because by then people were baying for Dragos blood and willing Rocky to destroy his soviet foe. To put the icing on the cake at the end he gives the film an anti-war message to ease the conscience of the politically correct. Superb.<br/><br/>Dolph Lundgren is terrific as drago, with limited speech and no signs of human feeling projects the idea that he has been locked up in a training facility as kind of an experiment and used as a pawn in the east v west struggle for the title of super-power.<br/><br/>With a pumped up soundtrack and excellent fight sequences,albeit over the top Rocky IV was the highest grossing film of the entire series. Pure entertainment."
"DarthVoorhees","8","1","2","12 November 2005"," Ridiculous? Very much so but Stallone makes us believe this story...
","Fourth entry in the story of the Italian Stallion this time he finds himself fighting for America against a Soviet monster of a boxer. After regaining his title at the end of III Rocky is somewhat taking it easy.The tone of the first film is completely gone.We know this when Rocky gives a robot to his free loader of a brother-in-law Paulie.A new boxer from the Soviet Union has risen named Ivan Drago the sports writers are very much interested in him.Apollo Creed Rocky's good friend and trainer challenges Drago to a fight.Rocky and Adrian protest saying he isn't ready for a fight but Creed won't listen.Creed is beaten to a bloody pulp and dies in Rocky's arms. Rocky challenges Drago to a fight to regain his friend's honor. The fight is a media frenzy.Rocky flies to the Soviet Union and trains in the wild vigorously. Drago on the other hand has a specially training aid as Dolph Lundgren himself said in the recent I Love the 80's special on VHI, he was a juicer.<br/><br/>Does this movie make a bit of sense? No not in the least bit. Drago's punches have enough force to punch Rocky's head right off his shoulders.The story is cheesy.And Rocky's We can change speech is cornball behind belief. But Rocky IV is a good film and one I would recommend.The atmosphere,and the acting pulls you in and makes a horrible script work.Stallone successfully makes you look past reality and clichÃ©s to entertain you. Rocky IV is probably the best popcorn film ever made.It certainly helped Dolph Lundrgen's career,the man's a horrible actor but his mere presence in Rocky IV is enough to scare the hell out of you."
"tastyhotdogs","8","1","2","21 October 2005"," ""If I Can Change...""
","Certainly the best of the Rocky franchise and one of the best movies ever, particularly in the Comedy/Action genre (not that it's supposed to be a comedy).<br/><br/>This movie picks up with Apollo in retirement, with Rocky the World Champ. When Russian sensation Drago hits the boxing world, it's clear the sport has changed as we know it. Apollo is grated by the Russian's brash attitude and begs Rocky to let him take him on in an exhibition. Rocky agrees and Apollo takes on Drago in the exhibition. Tragedy follows, and without giving too much away it's safe to say Apollo won't be making any more comebacks.<br/><br/>Rocky is crushed and is faced with an agonizing decision- does he take this like a little girl or does he seek revenge? Sure the Russian is twice his size, but Rocky has heart. This is where the movie takes off with some electrifying boxing sequences, music courtesy of ""Survivor"" and brilliant scripting, culminating in the best speech in the history of cinema. If you haven't seen it, rush to the video store now. You'll need to see this if you're planning on checking out Rocky XI, something I won't be doing as I've never seen Rocky V because I want the Rocky Franchise to end on a high for me, something I wished I'd done after Police Academy 4."
"sveknu","8","1","2","25 July 2005"," ""I m-u-s-t b-r-e-a-k y-o-u!""
","I really have to say it: Dolph Lundgren fits really well into his robot-like, stone-faced evil Russian guy-role. He does a good job with his part here, like he also does a few years later with the same kind of role in in ""Red Scorpion"". I don't know what the Russians think of being portrayed like that, but it's just so fun and so 80's or early 90's. There are many great moments in this movie. The introduction to the fight between Apollo and Drago is really entertaining and funny. The preparations for the final match is also great, especially because the scenes are matched with the great song ""No Easy Way Out"". And of course, the final fight itself is good. Stallone did a good job getting in shape for this movie."
"Artdoag2","10","1","2","20 March 2005"," ROCKY IV is the best! Powerful and uplifting
","This movie ROCKS! It is so inspirational that when I rented it on 3/14/05 I was totally motivated to take up working out again after a 2-year break. It has the best tunes... ""Hearts On Fire"", ""Burning Heart"", ""No Easy Way Out"", and ""Living In America"". The training montages are, in my humble opinion, the best of any sports-oriented movie ever. OK, the movie is a ""Rocky"" flick, and it's not ""Schindler's List"" or ""Glory"".<br/><br/>But who cares! The interaction between Apollo and Rocky is amazing and shows how the two characters developed an undying friendship over the course of their careers. The East vs. West theme is dated but indicative of the late Cold War era of the 1980s. The final fight is unrealistic as expected, but awesome! If you wanna see boxing how it really is, watch a televised match or ""Million Dollar Baby"" for some authenticity.<br/><br/>I can be realistic, and Rocky IV isn't close to the greatest movie ever made. Not by a long shot. But a movie is many things: the story itself, the directing, the casting choices, the technical aspects, and the soundtrack. To me, the camaraderie of the cast is wonderful. Rocky, Adrian, Apollo, Paulie, and Duke (Tony Burton; Apollo and Rocky's corner man) have wonderful moments and dialogue together. My favorite is Apollo's mention of ""nails"" and Rocky jokingly mishears it as ""snails"" and the dialogue that follows. Plus I like when Bridgette Nielsen's character (Drago's wife) is at the press conference and says ""Why you insult us?"" I dunno, she says it kind of choppy-like, and she sounds like an authentic Russian/Soviet chick.<br/><br/>Some gripes... it's too short by about 15 minutes. I would have liked to see some more of Apollo's wife... I mean, after all, it was HER hubby who died after fighting Drago. A few scenes with her and Rocky and Adrian would have given the story some amazing emotion and depth. Also, Rocky's final speech is kiiiiinda lame and simplistic. If he had shown some more emotion at certain moments, it would have helped a bit (or maybe it shows his distancing himself from anything but the upcoming fight). Lastly, since Adrian flew to Russia to be with Rocky for his fight, it would have been cool if she participated in his conditioning. I mean, she could have done some calisthenics with him(aren't women into it?)... something I've never seen Rocky do! A real fighter has got to be limber! Plot hole!<br/><br/>All inconsistencies aside, the story is direct and easy to follow. It must be said that having a great soundtrack is no small feat. Rocky IV is uplifting and energizing in a way many movies aspire to but never attain."

","I cannot even start to understand why this movie has such a low rating. This is one of the greatest movies ever created.  Rocky IV is the climax of all the Rocky movies.  Rocky faces his greatest adversary yet,(Dolph Lundgren) the Russian.  Plus this is the film where Apollo Creed is killed. If you cannot feel the emotion in this movie then you must be one cold hearted person. The battle between the boxers is symbolic of the struggles between Russia and America.  Since America wins, I think everyone should appreciate this film.  Even though in the end Rocky single handedly makes everyone in the stadium like him, whether they are Russian or American. This movie makes the viewer look into their hearts and try to achieve something that seems impossible.  Just the Rocky thought beating the Russian was impossible. For all the people who rated this movie below a 7 - I guess you people couldnt recognize a great film if it bit you in the butt.  My rating for this film is a 10/10, which it should be."

"LuboLarsson","9","1","2","28 April 2002"," A guilty pleasure
","Ok on the whole this film is very silly and a million miles away from the realism of the original Oscar winning original, but if you are in the mood for comic strip non-stop action, then Rocky IV is hard to beat. Credit to Sylvester Stallone in 1985 he certainly knew what his fans wanted and this film was one of the biggest money earners of the year alongwith his other film of that year Rambo First Blood Part II. As in Rocky III, Stallone kills off one of the major characters in the series as Appollo Creed is killed fighting Russian fighting machine Ivan Drago in a superbly staged fight, and this sets up a grudge match between the Soviet and our hero Rocky Balboa...in Russia! Which is the perfect set up for an utterly fantastic training sequence (in my opinion the best of the five films) as Rocky trains in the mountains, chopping logs, climbing mountains (!) as Drago trains in a state of the art space-age training gym, boosted by performance enhancing drugs. Its the good old USA v The Soviet Union, who needs a nuclear war when you can settle your diffrences in the ring. This part dates Rocky IV badly, and to be honest the sheer anti-communist feel of the film sits uneasily in the Rocky series, also one of the best things of the films was Rockys easy going, likeable personality, but after Appolos death he's more like Rambo than Rocky. The fight at the end is spectacular and they obviously had mre money to spend on this one. Also I must mention this film has a great 80's soundtrack too, and there is a great sequence that shows clips of all the previous films. I still really enjoy this film and i give it a hard hitting ***7/10***, ignore Rocky V though, it tried to recapture the feeling of the original and failed miserably."

","'Rocky IV' tries to keep the Rocky world alive by introducing yet another match and making sure that Rocky does not give up fighting. This time, Rocky vows revenge on a Russian champion who killed Apollo in a fight. Rocky feels the need for some revenge, so he frantically does everything that he can to make himself strong enough to defeat the Russian. He puts his life in danger, much to the upset of his wife. Again, this film revisits the strength that Rocky receives through his wife. The story is pretty tacky, and the film seems as if it is pushing a political message at the same time as telling a story. This film is really the downhill for Rocky, and I don't recommend it."
"emilyroseirvine","2","1","3","26 December 2017"," Hard to Watch
","I'd like to consider this film the black sheep of the Rocky series. Our rags to riches streetwise boxer is now surrounded by all the luxuries life has to offer while still holding on strong to the world title, and has now turned his once greatest foe, Apollo Creed, to his greatest friend. However, Apollo is keen to restore his name when the Soviet Union enters the boxing scene, presenting the 6'5"" punching machine; Ivan Drago. In the ring Drago unleashes a killer punch on Creed, demonising the remorseless Russian. Rocky is left distressed by the sudden death and vows to fight Drago in Moscow to not just avenge Creed, but also to put a stop to this soviet scheme. In traditional Rocky fashion, he wins.<br/><br/>The politics in this film reflect the time and send a clear message: America Good, Russia Bad. There are many details that make this film unconvincing, but the main point, in simple terms, is that Rocky is fighting a man who is funded by the government to destroy Americans. His opponent has no personality. He is a robot. Rocky has also lost his likable characteristics in his wealth and vanity. Say what you will about Rocky V, but Rocky is best when he returns to his roots.<br/><br/>This film lacks the motivational kick that the other Rocky films have. All the other Rocky films I have finished in one sitting, but this one had to be stretched out over the course of three days. Sometimes I asked myself if I really needed to watch it until the end because I knew he was going to win anyway, but as a Rocky fanatic I felt the need to consume all the media I could find in the fear that I'd miss a slight detail affecting the rest of the series. The only thing you need to know is that Apollo is now dead. If you don't particularly care for the Rocky series, give this a skip. If you're a Rocky fan you have a 50/50 chance of liking this film. The film deserved an extra star because it still has the mildly well-choreographed fight scenes and entertaining training montage, but nothing that stands out compared to the others. <br/><br/>Sly, we know commies are bad. We didn't need a Rocky film about it."
"neobateman","5","1","3","11 February 2017"," Patriotic garbage with OK acting and good fights
","Rocky IV was released in 1985. It became the most successful entry in the whole franchise. So what is the 'story' of this film. Due to a tragedy Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) has to go up against Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren). An evil boxing machine from the Sowjet union. In short if you wanna see America kick Russia's butt in boxing? Than here you go. The biggest issue with Rocky IV is the story and the characters. Most of the characters in this movie are idiots, and the ones who aren't become idiots. Why should the audience care about Rocky? He's no longer the underdog from Philadelphia. There is little to no story either, just fights or training montages. Which is why this film even gets this score, as the music is fun, cheesy 1980s and the sequences are nice and well made."
"connorbbalboa","4","1","3","12 November 2016"," The day the Rocky series died (until 2006 that is)
","There is something to be said about film series that start with great, serious filmmaking, and then descend into goofball antics as they go on. The Rocky series is one of the definitive examples of this. The first Rocky was an excellent film that told a great story about a great character who was brought to life thanks to Sylvester Stallone's charm and raw acting. Rocky II was a fantastic sequel which, despite a couple of problems, managed to keep the viewer rooting for our favorite underdog champion. Rocky III started these antics with the Hulk Hogan wrestling match and Rocky relying more on showbiz than actual heart and talent, but it still had room for genuine human drama and was a self-aware metaphor about having too much of a good thing and how one becomes a different person when he or she is famous. In a way, I think it predicted how Stallone's career would go for the next couple of decades. It's such a shame that this prediction started to prove itself correct so soon.<br/><br/>Rocky IV is considered a favorite to many fans, but it's soulless and has nothing that even resembles the first three films, despite the cast and the flashbacks to them. The story is, after the events of Rocky III, Rocky lives the quiet life until his new friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) asks him to be his trainer in an exhibition fight against Soviet Union boxer Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren); Drago is a fresh face in the Soviet Union who is the World Amateur Champion of Boxing and who is given steroids by his superiors to increase his strength and punching power. Apollo is ultimately disgraced as he is killed by Drago in a pretty short fight, and Rocky has to train in Russia and fight Drago himself to prove that good ol' America is better than the Soviets.<br/><br/>You might've guessed this, but the main reason I really don't like this film is because of how goofy it is even when compared to the first three films. The fact that Rocky is fighting a big muscular steroid-pumped boxer a decade and a half his junior alone takes the cake in ridiculousness. Everyone knows that as the series went on, Rocky's condition became more unrealistic, but here, it reaches a peak in lack of credibility; if the fight happened in real life, it would have been over in 30 seconds. And while the Rocky films are not really a go-to on how to box, there was something to each of the final fights in the previous films. Here, Rocky and Drago are just beating the crap out of each other with the sole objective of making the other person stay down. But Rocky keeps coming despite the punishment; if Rocky seems to be doing fine despite this, then there are no stakes. Also, there is a big musical sequence before the Apollo/Drago fight and is all flashy and is only meant to show up Drago, as Apollo is still a cocky son of a gun (you'd think that there would be some character development after a few movies)<br/><br/>Also, Rocky's brother in law, Paulie (Burt Young) has a robot that has no purpose in the film other than to add comedy and look sleek. Apparently, the robot was a legit thing that was used to promote autistic awareness; Stallone put it in the film because he thought it looked pretty cool. That gives you an idea of the mentality behind this movie.<br/><br/>It also feels like Stallone has run out of ways to write proper dialogue for this series, as many of the moments of dialogue don't feel genuine and there is some dialogue that is rather weak.<br/><br/>The Soviet bad guys are pretty one-dimensional and Drago, other than his fighting prowess is unimpressive as a human being; he doesn't speak (an intentional acting choice from Lundgren) and his dialogue sounds so monotone (trying to emphasize him as a robot). Brigitte Nielsen plays his wife and her acting is very unconvincing. Drago's superiors' main objective with the final fight is to prove how weak the U.S. is, and they have no qualms about Apollo's death. Bottom line it's pretty simple what the movie is saying: Americans: good, Soviets: bad. Again, it feels like there are no personal stakes for Rocky.<br/><br/>Rocky IV is simply a bad movie that tarnishes what Stallone accomplished with the original Rocky in 1976 and should be avoided by those who have any respect for that film. Viewers watching the series for the first time should skip this one and Rocky V and go straight to Rocky Balboa once they've gotten past Rocky III."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","3","3 November 2016"," The least of the Rocky series so far, but it's still fun to watch
","Although it isn't as iconic or as well made as the films which preceded it, ROCKY IV is still an entertaining film in the long-running franchise, a memorable Cold War encounter that tries to do something a little different than what's come before. Essentially it's the US vs. Russia conflict reduced to two boxers at the top of their game duking it out in the ring, and it has an air of '80s cheesiness about it that the previous sequel avoided: we could have done without the talking robot stuff, and the soundtrack just isn't memorable like in the films that came before. This ROCKY sequel is more about making bucks at the box office: it's bigger, slicker, more explosive, yes, but it lacks the gritty realism that the first two films contained. Halfway through the film there's a ten minute flashback sequence to the earlier movies that's been put in there for the fans alone.<br/><br/>Still, there's stuff that makes this film special anyway. Rocky's relationship with his family is as interesting as ever, and Paulie has a little more characterisation than in ROCKY III, even if he is still a background character. The character arcs are engaging, as we witness Apollo Creed come to the end of his long-running arc and Rocky himself battling fear for the first time in his life. Needless to say, the actors are fine: Stallone, Shire, Young and Weathers fit into their roles like a glove and don't let us down, and Tony Burton, Apollo's trainer, steps up to the plate with some heartening scenes that might indicate he's the new Mickey. The Russian villains are ice-cold: Brigitte Nielsen's here, just before she swapped to play the heroine in Stallone's COBRA, and Dolph Lundgren appears in his breakout turn as the robotic Russian boxer. He makes far more of an impact here than he did in his blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance as a henchman in A VIEW TO A KILL.<br/><br/>Things I liked especially here were the training sequences, which swap locations to the icy Siberian wastes and feel fresh and inventive as a result, and the extended Rocky vs. Drago climax, which is one of the most exciting yet. The film as a whole has left me raring to see the next sequel."

","First of all, let us get the obvious out of the way: 'Rocky IV' is not a great film. Even naming it as a good film would be a decidedly generous assessment. There is extremely little character development. Adrian (Talia Shire) and Paulie (Burt Young), unlike in the first two films (and to a certain extent, the third one), are given very little to do, and the film never attempts to further explore their relationship with Rocky. In fact, Paulie is basically relegated to a clichéd comic-relief character.<br/><br/>However, I really am surprised to find myself saying that 'Rocky IV' does contain a few fine moments, most particularly Rocky's training montage in Russia, intercut with the arduous exercise routine of his opponent. It appears that, in order to emerge victorious, Rocky has returned to nature. Whilst Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) runs on a treadmill in a stuffy training studio, Rocky jogs through the open air of the Russian wilderness; whilst Drago lifts a hefty weights bar, Rocky lifts a wagon; whilst Drago pumps himself full of steroids, Rocky shovels down spoonfuls of spinach. This montage, set to the inspirational tune of a Survivor song I can't remember, culminates in a genuinely spectacular aerial shot of Rocky standing victorious at the peak of a snowy mountain, the glorious sun beaming behind him as he shouts his opponent's name in readiness.<br/><br/>The final boxing match is cartoonish, over-the-top and ultimately everything we've come to expect from a 'Rocky' film. It is also somewhat amusing to witness how Rocky manages to single-handedly win over a stadium full of fiercely patriotic Russian communists through his remarkable American courage and dogged determination. From the moment the fight begins, we already know that Rocky is going to win, but that is beside the point. We just want to be there to cheer him on."

I thought Sylvester played an OK role, not as good as the other Rocky's though but the performances of Talia Shire, Burt Young and Dolph Lundgren (hope is spelled it right) were great.

"Butch-Higgins","Null","1","3","30 April 2003"," Camp meets propaganda to create nearly the ultimate 80s flick
","Awesome camp combines with propaganda filmmaking to shame Eisenstein and Riefenstahl, in another entry in the always-entertaining Rocky series. ROCKY IV was released in the same year in which Stallone gave us RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD PART II, and refashions Rocky Balboa as another superpatriotic icon of American brawn (he even gives a Rambo-esque ""political"" speech at the end). Jingoism aside, ROCKY IV is also as 80s as it gets, with a supporting role for Brigitte Nielsen, as well as a robot addition to the Balboa household that looks like the kind of thing that could nowadays be picked up for a few dollars at Toys R Us, and more soft rock and synth pop tunes than you could shake a stick at. (Stir in Kim Basinger and some gratuitous nudity, and you'd pretty much have the ultimate 80s movie.) In a move that perhaps no filmmaker has ever replicated, the running time is padded out by the awesomely cheeky means of dropping an MTV-style promo consisting of clips from earlier ROCKY flicks into the middle of the movie! Still, ROCKY IV is slick and fun, with some great moments: the scene in which Russian boxer Ivan Drago (a superb Dolph Lundgren), finds himself being raised on a moving ring into the Las Vegas venue where he's fighting Apollo Creed, accompanied by a live performance of James Brown's ""Living In America"" and the tackiest imaginable celebration of Americana, complete with dancers and fireworks, is truly inspired - Drago clearly has no idea what's going on, and the expression of bewilderment and contempt on his face is priceless. As the larger-than-life Creed, Carl Weathers dominates the first third of the picture, while Talia Shire and Burt Young are as good as ever."

","East challenges West. Drago(Lundgren, imposing as ever) must fight Rocky(Sly, charming yet no longer an underdog, and he's now impossible to relate to. The first is the only up to this entry where, if he wins, his victory doesn't feel like wish fulfillment. And this one goes extreme in that regard). They again don't know what to do with Adrian(Shire, sweet and supportive). Paulie(Young, bad tempered) is a caricature of what he used to be. Creed(Weathers, vocal) couldn't be more show-boaty than he is here, and it gets embarrassing to watch. He literally performs a whole dance number, moments before getting into the ring. While I get building him up, isn't this what you use lookalikes for? Does *anybody* in the universe these create know what ""exhibition"" means? And who will die from their connection to the sport? It won't be literal, public murder by knock-out, will it? After all, that would be absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>Just how shark-jumping and painfully 80's is this? A human-sized super-smart robot which there is no actual doubt Paulie is regularly sexing up which you're expected to just accept as presented. A boxing match, plus a simplistic speech after it, end the Cold War? Why wouldn't it? And as fitting as the Commie one is – tall, silent, strong, statuesque, with clear indications of ""unnatural"" improvements made – the US champ really doesn't represent the country well. Sure, the determination fits, meanwhile, well, shock and awe, the best education and training, where are those? And he doesn't use proxies...no perpetual war oh wait that came later...well, they do have the ""going in unprepared against an enemy they obviously don't understand"", so there's that. Lang also isn't in this. Then again, he seems to exist only in III, never before or since. This is 84 and a half minutes without credits, 88 with, but would be shorter, maybe an hour long total, if you removed the recap, music videos and montages.<br/><br/>There is some bloody violence and mild language in this. I recommend this to those who love the decade more than anyone should. Of course, watching it *is* better than relying on cultural osmosis to appreciate the 30 For 30 parody on it.

","What used to be a series of films about boxers has become a franchise almost exclusively about boxing. Where the focus was once on people, the focus is now on the mashing up of people; where once it was interesting, it has, by the point of Rocky IV, become extremely uninteresting. One of the easiest pieces of criticism in the world is to cite 1976's Rocky as better than most of its sequels, but there was a film about people wandering around; talking; falling in love and ambling through unremitting times. Now, we witness all that shelved for aggressive caricatures and crass causality which underpin a really unbalanced air of smug nationalism. Throw in a tacked on message at the very end, in spite of all that precedes it, about how sport brings everyone together (regardless of nationality, political belief or otherwise) anyway and you have a badly judged; poorly thought through mess of a sports film that does few people many favours.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone is the eponymous Rocky Balboa, a man with countless opponents already vanquished and a heavy number of victories already under his belt. As is the case with the beginnings of most of these sequels, we're introduced to Rocky as a man living the ideal life amidst the big-time; he's got the latest sports cars, a fantastic domestic set up, complete with wife and kid, and is the world champion again. He even finds room to encompass into his world the latest in modernity in the form of a curious, automated robot butler such is the depth of his personal wealth. Where time has passed; infants have grown and money expanded, so too have the years on Balboa – careers in boxing do not last long, and Rocky has been around the block enough times to lose big bouts; come back and win rematches, before further succumbing only to successfully garner the fame once again. <br/><br/>This fuss arrives when a Russian amateur named Ivan Drago (Lundgren) arrives in The States to test themselves against what the Americans have to offer. Drago is a quiet, seemingly shy, boxer who's well built and shepherded around by his entourage, of whom appear just as friendly as they do ignorant of their surroundings and American's boxing depth. Apollo Creed, one time foe turned mutual accomplice out of the bouts and respect Rocky and he have for one another, is around, but is long past fighting in spite of still possessing the itch to do so. With Drago's arrival, and Creed's eagerness, the pair match up in a fight Creed reckons will be easier than everyone thinks given this young opponent is foreign; not professional and just generally a bit of alien to things. Creed's gaze, as he watches Drago on the television on the evening's news, besots him with the idea of getting back into the ring – his observation of Drago as this young, unknown amateur seemingly ripe for the taking carries with it an odd dynamic of homoeroticism at the thought of once again implementing power upon someone inferior to him.<br/><br/>Disaster strikes when, under dramatic circumstances, the Soviet boxer upsets all odds and wins the fight: killing our Creed in the process; an instance that hits Rocky hard and throws his domestic bliss into turmoil when he's determined to get back in there and take the fight to Drago in honour of Creed. Overlying the drama is the tension born out of the fact Balboa and Creed were always at similar stages in their boxing career, and a mere exhibition fight against an eccentric wrestler earlier was enough of a challenge in itself. Thus, Rocky's own proposed idea of going up against this now indomitable force from the East is fraught with madness and danger, and is very much the plan of action wife Adrian (Shire) goes against. Regardless, Balboa gets it into his head he must for sake of retribution on account of his dear friend Creed while certain others get it into their heads that Rocky must win on account of resorting national pride. So much for him being the ""Italian"" Stallion.<br/><br/>The bad news is that a great deal of it is nonsense and the film on the whole is just a bit rubbish. The Russians are cartoonish and underdeveloped; their inclusion, in a political and propagandist sense, clumsy and ill-judged; the idea to change the nationality of the opponent this time around sussed by the dissatisfied audience fairly quickly in that it's essentially a ploy to disguise the fact you're watching the same sequel a third time. Very little works, although I quite liked Brigitte Nielsen's inclusion as this prim, photogenic dominatrix-type who does all of Drago's talking for him at the press conferences as he obediently sits beside her. Though what is truly bizarre, is the way the film depicts the obligatory training montages of the two fighters nearer the fight. If I told you one of them has access to all the technology and computers they could wish for, while the other has only a small shack in the middle of snowy nowhere; that one of them goes overtime on a running machine, whereas the other scales hills and mountains for their exercise; that one uses stretching pulleys to maintain muscle, while the other chops firewood with an axe, which boxer would you think underwent one training regime and which would you think underwent the other? This is, I'm afraid, as fresh as it gets."

Now here enter the soviets.They have brought a hulking 6-6 tall 250 pound amateur boxing champion Ivan Drago.The man weighs 1850 lbs when he delivers his best punch. In the story as usual in those times Russians were again portrayed as vicious like they were in the USA just to embarrass their American counterparts. Apollo creed jumps in out of his retirement as to teach the Russian that he is a nobody and it takes a lot of courage and heart to be a champion not being big strong and bio chemical making of body enhancement. But he underestimated the capability of Ivan Drago , the exhibition match ended as fatal and disasters defeat for Apollo. Rocky who was in there as watching as Apollo s aide and supporter decided to take on next challenge to take on the huge soviet in the heart of his own country. If you see the movie things are aggravated soon when Apollo used some aggressive statements about the Russian and there he decided to inflict heavy damage to Apollo. While Rocky was trying to convince Apollo not to be impatient and impulsive about the fight before understanding his opponents abilities , Apollo goes on with the plan. Like Rocky 2 Adrian Balboa again confronts Rocky about his decision to contest and there is again some rift and distance between them. But as far as its sound track is concerned this was the one of best top 10s of 80s. The training montage was perhaps the best ever in this trilogy. In the fight when things get more tough the theme war was so excellent. I still enjoy its sound track. One of our late friend saw this movie in theater he said i was so thrilled that it occurred to me that i am going to have a boxing session with some body. But the most really incredible thing which was the life of the movie was Dolph Lundgren(ivan Drago). It was the best discovery by Stallone. Ivan drago proved almost the best opponent of Rocky Balboa. Dolph Lundgren himself was tall and hand some with good muscle built.From here perhaps he rose to stardom. Apart from anti-soviet propaganda i consider it one of my best in the 80s which i recommended to others resulting in appreciation all over. It belongs to both Rocky Balboa and Ivan drago from beginning till the the end."
"mercury4","10","1","4","10 February 2008"," A great movie and one of the best of the series
","This is a very good movie. The very first Rocky is a classic. There's no doubt about that. But this movie is still very good and very inspirational like the other Rocky movies. Rocky IV was very well made and very well done. The acting by everyone is great as usual. Tony Burton gives one of the best performances in this one. He has so many great lines. Because Duke loses Apollo and bonds with Rocky, it makes him such a big part of Rocky IV. You really end up liking him even more after this one. I can't understand why Tony Burton was barely used at all in Rocky V and VI. Other things I loved about Rocky IV were the training scenes in Russia, the masterfully choreographed fight scene, the fact that he grows the beard in training, and the fact that this is the first time that Adrian doesn't think he can win. Even though Bill Conti didn't do the score for this one and Vince DiCola was in there, it's fine. DiCola's score is great. It fits in perfectly with this Rocky. The songs on the soundtrack were great too. I loved Rocky IV's music. It was a nice departure from the same old thing. I honestly don't understand why anyone would think this is a bad movie.<br/><br/>The Cold War type storyline is good in this too. The USA Vs. the Soviet Union. We were always in competition with them. It was either buildings, our space program, or our military. There was also much competition in the Olympics for that gold medal. This movie has many great scenes. One of my favorite parts is when the Rocky Vs. Drago fight is about to start and the two of them are staring at each other. I also love the training scenes and the final fight. People keep knocking that little speech that Rocky gives in the end. I don't know why. That was very well done too. He tells the Soviets how they felt about him and the way he felt about them was able to change from the fight. If something so great like that can happen there, then there is hope for the Cold War to some day end. Rocky says, ""If I can change and you can change, everybody could change."" Great ending to a great movie.<br/><br/>What I don't like are these horrible, negative reviews. All of you really need to lighten up. This is just a Rocky movie. All of you stuffed shirts are ripping it apart and trying to analyze it. It's just a movie. I can also prove a lot of these negative reviews wrong. First off, maybe you think the Apollo Creed and Drago fight is fake and would never happen. It can very well happen. In 1962 Benny Paret fought Emile Griffith. It ended tragically in the 12th round. Griffith trapped Paret in a corner and mercilessly beat him until his head went crashing into the ring post. Paret was lying helplessly on the ropes and Griffith kept banging the hell out of him. Griffith hit Paret 20 times until the referee stopped it. Paret went into a coma and died 9 days later. Maybe you think it's fake how Rocky keeps going down in his fight with Drago. In Primo Carnera's fight with Max Baer, Carnera went down no less than 10 times. Carnera also happened to be a 6ft 9in giant that couldn't even lick my kid brother. It seems you people also think that Rocky would have never won in real life. If you took a 7ft giant, taught him how to throw a punch, pumped him with steroids and put him in the ring against a great fighter I wonder who would win. A great fighter like Rocky would obviously win. Ivan Drago was just a giant that was taught to hit hard and be like a machine. As soon as Rocky cut him he didn't know what to do. Steroids and freakish strength do not make you a great fighter. Also keep in mind that Drago's fight with Rocky was his first professional fight. It was also the first time he was fighting someone that could fight back and the first time he ever had to go 15 rounds. It's a wonder Drago did as good as he did. The Soviets were shocked when Rocky started making a fight out of it. There were a lot of things they didn't consider with there machine. One of those things was Rocky. Drago was, in a way, just like Mason Dixon from Rocky VI. He had to really show what he was made of and he probably came out of his experience with Rocky a better fighter. Towards the end of the fight the Russian people were cheering for Rocky. You people think that wouldn't happen. ""Everyone"" loves an underdog. When Jesse Owens, an African American, won at the Olympics, Berlin cheered for him. Hitler even waved to him to congratulate him. So tell me now if Rocky IV is far fetched and could never happen."

'Sounds good to me Bill, and don't forget the cute kid bit in the middles' 'Can't leave that out Bob.

Apollo Creed gets killed after his 'I love America' bit and Rocky jets off to Russia to kick steroid enhanced Soviet butt. The music is dreadful 80's cheese( with the exception of James Brown) and the training sequence is more homerotic than ever.

"ryan_murphy-1","10","1","4","2 June 2006"," The last great Rocky movie.
","Let's face it. All of the first four Rocky movies are great. (The fifth one is one of the most notorious films of all time, alongside such classics as Highlander II: The Quickening.) In my opinion, ""Rocky IV"" is the second-best of the bunch, next to the original, then III, and then II. In Rocky, we got to see the classic story of a down-on-his-luck prize-fighter getting a shot at the title, and going fifteen rounds with the World Champion. In II, he actually won the title, in III, he showed us the Eye of the Tiger, and in IV, he takes on the Soviet Union, in boxing of course. Seemingly inspired by the 1980 Miracle on Ice, ""Rocky IV"" tells another story of the Cold War being fought in sports, with Rocky once again being the underdog,a nd taking on a gigantic Soviet behemoth, played by Dolph Lundren (first Mr. T, then Dolph Lundren; how can you beat that?). It goes without saying that Rocky IV is the cheesiest of the bunch, with he Soviet having to be an enormously powerful man, whose power is often over exaggerated, but that's part of what makes it so entertaining. The battle is also very personal for Rocky, and this movie is, in some ways, the most intense of the series. It also has the best training montage, and some other great musical numbers. Certainly the best of the bunch movie-wise.<br/><br/>The series should have ended with IV, but we had to endure the dismal V, and now, goodness help us, we're going to have a Rocky VI. Oh well, at least we'll always be able to remember these first four great movies. Rent them!<br/><br/>""Hearts on fire!"""

"abyoussef","3","1","4","25 October 2004"," Popular, successful... but just doesn't stand the test of time
","by Dane Youssef<br/><br/>Of all of Sylvester Stallone's chapters of the 300+ volumes of the ""Rocky"" saga, ""Rocky IV"" is often referred to as the silliest, most soul-bereft... and altogether WORST of the saga. <br/><br/>Whearas, I have actually read posts from many (most on this site here) who renown this four-time Razzie-""winning"" champion of 1985 as a defecation of everything that made the 1976 original the classic it was, is and will continue to be as long as mankind roams on this rock third from the sun.<br/><br/>But yes, while ""Rocky IV"" is a film that is often cited as the worst of the whole ""Rocky"" franchise. Is it? <br/><br/>Many people despise ""Rocky V"" more. Dolph Lundgren is in real life a genius and a first-degree black-belt. Not a mention a wooden actor. More so than Stallone. The two have great chemistry and an arguably incredible (and ludicrous) showdown. But is this film too little too late.<br/><br/>You be the judge. <br/><br/>Let's take a good look at the + and the - at this movie.<br/><br/>PRO: Stallone throws together a boxing-training montage that is without a doubt, the best Iv'e ever seen. Rocky shows heart and soul and Drago is more machine than man. After it's over, you're ready to train to the big fight yourself! <br/><br/>The fight sequences are nothing short of riveting, between both boxers. It's grueling. There's tension pumping in all directions. You'd need a Ginsu to cut it. More action-packed than really dramatic. <br/><br/>CONS: Um... just about everything else. <br/><br/>Especially the final shot--the freeze-frame of the Itallion Stallion being draped proudly with the American flag.<br/><br/>But then again, let's not nitpick. A movie is supposed to be simply enjoyed, not estimated. ""Rocky IV"" is not a bad film, it's just not necessary. It's not really worth the effort. None of these films are truly awful. Maybe Stallone should've just hung up the Championship belt after clubbing Clubber Lang (Mr. T). But then again, who could blame him? Stallone put so much into 'Rocky' that people simply won't accept Stallone as anything else. He is not the most versatile record and he has the movies (and Razzies to prove it) to prove it. Stallone himself said no role fit him better. He designed the script so no one could play it as well as he could. It was his big break. People loved the Itallion Stallon, so Stallone kept cranking them out.<br/><br/>But whereas the first two ""Rocky"" movies were heartfelt dramas about people and their dreams, desires and abilities, over time the saga turned into over-inflated summer testosterone-driven action-movies.<br/><br/>Maybe because that's what Stallone himself was venturing into. The man was built for action. In other genres like drama, he's made undeniable marks with ""Rocky"" and ""Cop Land"" (though nothing else). And his contributions to comedy are laughable. Wait, that came out wrong... <br/><br/>The strange birthday party for Paulie had me looking in disbelief. Apparently he's spent so much time drinking and mooching off his brother in law, he's made no friends and Rocky and his family buy Paulie an actual robot. The robot serves as a servant, even a friend... and perhaps a lover? <br/><br/>Hee-hee-hee-hee. <br/><br/>Yeeesh. I got the creeps... actually, that's being charitable. I felt unclean. As if I had just been ""violated,"" I guess, is as good a word as any.<br/><br/>The exhibition where Apollo Creed prepares to break out of retirement to battle the 6'4"" Ivan Drago from Russia has an opening act of James Brown and an endless stream of Vegas musicians, showgirls all performing a loud, tacky and ugly rendition of ""Living In America."" The whole James Brown opening number is so ludicrously hideous, that you have to wonder if the whole inspiration came from the opening musical number to ""Springtime For Hitler"" from ""The Producers."" Was Stallone attempting to show how shameless America takes itself (even back then)?<br/><br/>Hey, if he was... nice piece of satire, Sly.<br/><br/>God help us all... and him if he wasn't.<br/><br/>Of course, even as shameless as all this... is the big end where he wraps himself in the American flag.<br/><br/>While Stallone does not have a great range as an actor, he has tailor-made roles that have allowed him to do what he does best and put asses in seats and gross big (""Rocky,"" ""Cliffhanger"" and 'Rambo""), probably because he knows his range better than anyone. My relief is that ""Rocky"" is over now and Stallone is currently working on another script which he has written for himself (as well as direct) and since he knows his abilities, it'll truly be something to watch.<br/><br/>I'll buy a ticket. Won't you?"
"Chuckles11","Null","1","4","16 August 2004"," Weak film that hurts trilogy
","Rocky IV is the first of the two ""unnecessary"" Rocky films. The series would have been perfectly ended after Rocky III, marking a strong trilogy, but it would continue with two more weak films that bring down the quality of the entire series.<br/><br/>This film goes where the previous Rockys did not go in which it tried to make a grand social commentary. Although Rocky I did a lot of focusing on the urban decay of Philadelphia, this film tries to do the Cold War commentary. But it makes the wrong one. Instead of commenting on the futility of both sides of the conflict, it simply puts all blame on the Russians, and does the classic ""America good, Russia bad"" motif. This film supports the idea that if the Russians open their eyes and stop being some oppressive, they will see the great glories of freedom and capitalism, which is an overly simplistic and biased viewpoint.<br/><br/>This film also fails with the death of Apollo Creed. It does what so many Hollywood films did up until probably the mid-90s, in the discarding of the black characters when their purpose was up, or enacting their deaths because they were expendable.<br/><br/>This film only works on the level that if the audience wishes to see weak acting, little character development, a kickass soundtrack, Stallone in great shape training, and a brutal gladiatorial brawl. Although I don't think anybody would argue that the Rocky series ever represented the pinnacle of acting quality, but this movie seems to be the weakest of the films at its time (of course Rocky V would completely blow it out of the water). The fight between Stallone and Lundgren is arguably the series best if judged on the level of two men just beating the crap out of each other. But that is the only redeeming factor of this film.<br/><br/>As stated before, this is an unnecessary film that should never have been made. Rocky goes through nothing in this film. In the three previous films, he had to endure in order to overcome. It's not the case in Rocky IV, in which Rocky is the same from beginning to end, the only change is that he no longer has Apollo at his side. Does Rocky IV entertain? Of course, and probably is the most entertaining of the series. The film does nothing but entertain us, there is no engagement. One can find the same in a clown or magician. So I suggest that people only watch the first three Rocky films, and stop there and consider IV and V to only be rumors, because it will bring down the quality of the series if viewed."

","After two decent films, Rocky III was released and was a resounding failure. But although the films lost quality with each sequel, they continued to get more and more popular at the box-office. After Rocky III raked in over $120 million, there would be no doubt that Stallone would churn out another installment of the Philadelphia pugilist. Using his huge success with Rambo: First Blood Part II the same year as a spring board, he gives us Rocky IV, undoubtedly one of the worst films of the 1980s (right down there with the Rambo series).<br/><br/>After Rocky defeats Clubber Lang (Mr. T) and regains the heavyweight title, a new boxer arrives. He is Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a cold, steel-like man who has been trained to perfection by the Soviet sports machine. Rocky's cocky friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) thinks he can take Drago in an exhibition match but the Russian's power goes on full display when Creed dies in the ring. Fueled by hate and the need for revenge, Rocky agrees to fight the unbeatable Drago in Moscow, where the world awaits a climatic showdown of east-versus-west.<br/><br/>If the Cold War ever turned hot, Russian POWs would be herded into theatres to see Rocky IV ten times a day. The movie is so blantantly stupid and hyper-patriotic, stone-cold Drago seems like the only sane one. Of course, while Rocky pulls logs and climbs mountains, Drago is being trained in high-tech gyms and being pumped up with steroids. His wife Ludmilla (Brigette Nielsen) seems nice and caring to the outside world, but inside she craves destruction just like her husband. Drago's trainer screams about how corrupt and backwards the culture of the United States is. He is right: corrupt, stupid, and offensive enough to release Rocky IV.<br/><br/>Stallone has no right to comment on situations he obviously knows nothing about. Making Communists the enemy is simply a way to lock a high-profit for the film. Rambo had the same pathetic political outlook: that America is the great country fighting against the ""evil empire"" that Ronal Reagan envisioned. Stallone is just as stupid as Reagan and takes pride in scenes where Rocky, the uneducated but lovable boxer from Philadelphia, wraps himself in the American flag and then gives a speech to the Moscow crowd, who cheer him on!<br/><br/>If you can put all this behind you, you can still see that the intangibles of the movie are pretty bad. Adrian and Paulie's characters become more and more useless as the films continue: this time Adrian only covers her face when Rocky is losing and Paulie simply talks with a life-size robot he gets for his birthday (!). Stallone himself has obviously overtaken his Rocky persona and is throughly stupid. As usual, Carl Weathers is the only bright spot in the production.<br/><br/>When it does come time for Rocky to face Drago in the ring, we don't see the underdog that just barely managed to stay up to win in Rocky II or the guy who went the distance with the heavyweight champ in Rocky. Now, Balboa is a huge, ripped machine who has no strategy but to pummell his enemy to death with non-stop hits. The fight is so cartoonish, completly with Drago giving Rocky the ""death-stare,"" it feels like video game propaganda.<br/><br/>Rocky IV is completly unlike anything seen in the first movie. How much our hero has changed! At first, he was a tough boxer with a will to win against all odds. Now, he is an oversize poster boy for the US, preaching against the Soviet EVIL. The champ was knocked out in Rocky III. This time listen to your corner, Rock, and stay down."

","If Rocky series would have stayed just as a trilogy, it would be now in higher rank.

Again we see Rocky training and fighting. There is nothing new in this one and it's beyond my brain capabilities to comprehend how this could have been such a successful film. But then again, I must admit I do enjoy the final fight between Rocky and Drago. It's brutal and silly but still enjoyable. The events that lead to the fight are predictable, boring and done with low effort.<br/><br/>Rocky IV feels these days much older movie than any period piece set in the 19th century.

You want to see the little guy, the under dog struggle and work hard and give it his best win or lose... and the best part about the Rocky franchise is that he doesn't always win, you see him hurt, you see him lose, and you see him get back up and fight.<br/><br/>And that is what Rocky IV delivers."

It was never a really strong series anyway, but this reduces it to nothing more than two fights and some music videos.  Where I and II had soap opera stuff to back up the action, and III had the sub-plot of staying sharp at the top, this has very little.  The story is literally 1  Creed dies, 2  Rocky drives round to flashbacks of the first 3 films before training in Russia and 3  Rocky versus Drago.  Segment 1 is silly  we forget all the `staying sharp at the top' stuff of III and instead have Rocky buffing his cars, buying ridiculous robots for his son etc, and Creed's fight is done with little real drama but lots of `noooooooo' style acting!  Segment 2 is little more than a long series of music videos as flashbacks and training scenes play under rock music.  The fight in segment 3 is OK, but it is very, very far from realism and is maybe a stretch too far.<br/><br/>The whole US v's USSR thing is a bit unsavory  the whole thing has a lot of anti-Russian feeling to it, despite Rocky's `message' to the two countries at the end.which to me said `lets all get along (but don't forget that America always wins)'.  Stallone does OK, but he doesn't have any depth that his character had developed in parts I-III.  Shire, Young and Weathers have very little to do, and Lungren is literally a robotic lump of meat for Rocky to overcome.  As for Nielsen  it is very clear from her performance that she only got the role because she was seeing Stallone at the time.<br/><br/>Overall this is easily the weakest of the series.

The final fight is horrifically unrealistic and once again, we see Rocky endure a beating that would kill any mortal human being multiple times.<br/><br/>For some unknown reason, the whole movie seems to be an attempt at a political message, culminating in a truly dreadful ending where Rocky's 'progressive' victory speech appears to instantly diffuse decades of East-West tension. The portrayal of Russians throughout this movie is lazy and offensive, particularly the politicians.<br/><br/>Balboa, who looked at his physical peak in Rocky III, now looks like a heavy steroid user. Dolph Lungdren looks great but his dialogue is so atrocious he may as well be a cartoon character. 'I must destroy you' and 'If he dies, he dies' are some of his personal highlights. Even Talia Shire is dragged down by this film, morphing into one of those trite sporting wives who just bleats clichés from the sidelines.<br/><br/>An absolute disaster of a movie, only to be enjoyed ironically."

","Here's a fun game; if you had to choose films to show to millennials to explain the 80's, what would you pick? The serious minded amongst you might go for Wall Street or if you wanted to illustrate how Vietnam stilled loomed in the American psyche you could go for Platoon. Cold War hysteria could be summed up by The Day After or WarGames. But if it's pop culture you're after, then you might choose a John Hughes film, or if you wanted to show how MTV culture took over then you might go for Flashdance.<br/><br/>But maybe the best choice would be Rocky IV which squishes together all of the above in just 90 minutes. PLUS it features a talking robot and a pulsing soundtrack of 80's power rock.<br/><br/>In the film, Rocky fights for World Peace by attempting to beat the living snot out of an evil Russian. No, don't laugh, just 6 years after this film was released, the Soviet Union fell. Coincidence? I think not.<br/><br/>The film itself is literally one cliche after another, accompanied by endless montages. And yet it is still somehow lovable. Possibly because it IS so familiar, so formulaic, so flashy and so desperate to work its audience into a frenzy.<br/><br/>In the end, while you will find yourself cringing at the dialogue, it's hard not to get caught up in it all. I defy even a hardened cynic from enjoying the movie.<br/><br/>But seriously, what the heck is it with that talking robot?

","On the film's own merits this is an entertaining balls to the wall boxing film. The action is faintly absurd and the jingoism is little bit embarrassing today. Nonetheless, it has an underdog American winning against a soulless communist. Given the franchise fixation on exploring the American dream and general Americana Rocky IV was a natural extension to the concept. Drago is a great foil for Rocky and on the basic level he is entertaining. Apollo's death is touching. The film does suffer from being the 3rd sequel and moreover there's a lot of weird plot elements. The less said about the robot the better.<br/><br/>The film is greatly enhanced by Creed II existing. Returning to this text now Drago has some depth-note how he says ""I must break you"" not ""I will break you""-and given the plot developments in Creed II he comes across as more of an antagonist, not villain, now. The film has a surprising complexity post-Creed II that make it at once an effective piece of propaganda and a self-aware drama about the human cost of dehumanization. This text combined with a Creed II really demands a Drago film gets made.<br/><br/>The film, like all of the later sequels, lacks the earnest blue collar feel of the the first film. A slightly more restrained direction would have made the film even better. This just screams the 1980's as result of the hyped up action.<br/><br/>Of the various extensions of the Rocky mythos this is best one and really set the stage for the Creed franchise. Good film."

","Even if Stallone does not completely destroys the film and his character like in Rambo: First Blood, Part II, which flirts with a nauseating anti-Vietnamese fascism, it is clear that this biggest commercial success of the saga, which stimulated much attention from the press because of his Cold War hints during the years of Ronald Reagan's presidency, suffers from evils that do not belong to the wonderful character Rocky Balboa. And it's a shame, because with the exception of the primary anti-Soviet propaganda, this fourth episode is not a bad movie in itself. The final message of peace, which relativizes the US warmongering character of the film to tend towards a certain humanism, is salutary: ""I came here tonight, I didn't know what to expect. I saw a lot of people hate me and I didn't know what to feel about that so I guess they didn't like much nothin' either.

3/5<br/><br/>Rocky 4 or (Rocky IV) see's Rocky Balboa coming out of retirement to go up against the steroid addicted Ivan Drago (and the whole of Russia) For the most part, it's poorly acted and the actors just look bored. It's clear Stallone has lost enthusiasm for the franchise writing a cliché script that just copies the best bits from the previous films whilst throwing in cheesy moments of its own. It has got to the stage now where it's in goofy guilty pleasure territory. <br/><br/>The Rocky films were so much more than this and evidently should have ended by the third entry. The performances are wooden all round especially from Sly Stallone and Brigitte Neilson. However the last act is where the film sort of redeems itself. It's a real crowd pleaser from the training sequence to the final fight. Thankfully Rocky 5 and 6 put the franchise back on track by abandoning the silliness of this. It's not the best film in the series but it's certainly the most enjoyably stupid, cheesiest fun you'll probably have."

","Yeah!<br/><br/>The Rock got to Russia, feeling that he had to be the good ambassador for the U.S. of A by avenge his friend Creed, who got his brain smashed in by a Soviet athlete in a show-match. (The myth of robot-like Russian was in full bloom by the time; the Soviet hockey team destroyed everything in their way through the whole 80's, with very few exceptions.)<br/><br/>This artificial movie is somehow entertaining, by all means. Very well packed in, with the whole mid 80's feeling you got watching this flick today. Some quite good acting is sometimes messed up by the silliness of over-exposed clothing and car brands. (Yes, I know.....nothing has changed 30 years later.) Once an actor superstar was wearing something on screen, people rushed to the stores for getting that flashy, important feeling of self awareness by getting those aviator jackets and Adidas clothes.<br/><br/>The movie itself smells quite bad of patriotism and propaganda. You know: The land of the Free, vs communist Russia. (The doubtful American actor president of Ronnie Reagan negotiated hard by this time with Russian political chief Gorbatjov, to keep the force measurement of both countries low, on a chill.)<br/><br/>Well, but the movie sometimes got it's effective moments. The training camp scenes in Russia really gets to you, and the struggle of knowing that you got to fight for your life is very well reflected in Stallone's acting.<br/><br/>Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren was to always being associated to this movie.

","I'm nowhere near a Rocky aficionado (I still haven't seen the first three movies), so I don't really have a yard stick to compare ""Rocky IV"". Still, it's not rocket science, and the opening is enough to catch all the laymen up. But there's one thing that doesn't jibe: how in hell is Rocky going to survive (let alone best) a man that can punch with inhuman strength? No amount of American know-how montages will excuse this.<br/><br/>And as for the montages (there are what, 4 in this movie?), it really does feel like you're watching a music video after awhile. The key to this movie is its value as an '80s tchotchke. The idea of Rocky going to Russia, beating the monster and signaling the end of the Cold War is beyond silly. It's asinine. But the movie's entertaining enough to (mostly) carry through that. The soundtrack's pretty good, too (I've got a couple songs on my gym list). The movie's an artifact from a time when MTV ruled our culture, and Stallone clearly wanted in on it.<br/><br/>Not a great movie, but it's surprisingly seductive in its watchability.

","'Rocky' was a wonderful movie about a fully realized three-dimensional character with his own unusual way about him. We liked him and we wanted him to succeed and even when he didn't we still loved him anyway for facing insurmountable odds. 'Rocky II' was less effective but still maintained Rocky's charm and dealt nicely with his fight for self respect. 'Rocky III' was mindless but still energetic and entertaining and I accepted it as such. 'Rocky IV' is glossy, stupid and drains all of the personality traits about Rocky that we liked in the first movie.<br/><br/>This go around is simply baffling. It begins with Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) facing off on an exhibition match with a Russian behemoth named Draco (classic non-actor Dolph Lundgrin). Creed is killed in the ring and that leaves Rocky to think that he has to get into the ring with Draco to .. . what? Teach him a lesson? That leads to the inevitable. There are a list of clichés that this movie must follow and 'Rocky IV' does not deviate from them one bit. Following the tragedy we must see: 1.) The mourning scene complete with flashbacks. 2.) The press conference. 3.) The conflict about whether or not to go through with it. 4.) The training montage which ends with a victorious freeze frame. 5.) The pre-fight pep talk. 6.) The fight which begins with the two men facing each other down and exchanging macho one liners. 7.) The moment when it looks like Rocky will lose. 8.) The people at ringside yelling for the fight to be stopped. 9.) The victorious punch in which Rocky knocks out Draco. 10.) Rocky's lame post-fight public announcement. Believe me, I haven't given anything away.<br/><br/>Draco the villain is played by Dolph Lundgrin one of the most lifeless actors that I've ever seen, especially here. He stands straight up looking stone-faced and barely says a word. His wife does all the talking for him but there is never a scene the shows the two of them together or for that matter ever shows Draco as any kind of human being. In the third movie, Mr T. was a silly comic book caricature but at least he has some energy.<br/><br/>The first two Rocky movies were loaded with personalities. Apollo Creed was a man with much pride but still wounded and very human. Adrian was an understanding woman baffled by having so much attention from this lug who was trying to win her over. Paulie was a wounded drunk constantly living in his brother-in-law's shadow. All those traits are gone. The supporting cast now stands by and looks concerned from their places in the background. I would say that Stallone should quit this series while he's ahead but that would have been two movies ago."

","Rocky 4 is generally a very good action film. Agreed: the plot is fairly simple. Agreed: the music is very 80s. Agreed: the characters don't develop much, except Rocky. Agreed: Stalone much have been very tired and out of ideas when he wrote a robot into the script (silly idea). But lets be frank: Rocky 4 is really good fun. There's a reason it grossed world-wide 10 times as much money as it took to make, i.e. over twice as much gross as Rocky 3. That's because most people seemed to really enjoy it. Why is that then? What can you expect from it?<br/><br/>It's 90 minutes of excitement, pretty much from beginning to end. And it builds. By the time you know Rocky is going to fight the Russian, you just cannot wait to watch it. The training scenes, the guest appearance from 'the Godfather of Soul' and the montage are all memorable. But without question it's the fight scene that takes centre stage. We have here, in Rocky 4, one of the best fight scenes in any action movie ever made. It doesn't get much better than this. Of course, all the actors hold their own very well, as we've come to expect of the Rocky movie stars. And the film is a very convincing show of determination and suspense.<br/><br/>We know that Rocky is determined. It's one of the main themes of these films. But I don't think you'll ever know how determined the man is until you watch this. It's a classic action flick and worthy of more than 6.3. All things considered, it has to be an 8."

","This represents the culmination of Rocky's efforts, his final frontier and ultimate challenge which stays true to everything the character stands for, grit, determination, perseverance and heart. This could have made for an epic ending to a franchise which has won the hearts and admiration of many. <br/><br/>It is impressed upon you that this was the film Sylvester Stallone has been building towards, where Rocky Balboa seemingly 'achieves the impossible'. His opponent, Dolph Lundgren's Ivan Drago is his most fearsome yet, made of steel like Mr T's Clubber Lang but a towering beast of a man, whose actions do much of the talking. Lundgren came across as authentic and true to the persona, Rocky's most formidable opponent and definitely his most notable after Apollo Creed. He made you believe that his brute force could kill.<br/><br/>Tragedy and hardship is very much a recurring theme through the series and it returns to possess Rocky who Stallone portrays with a consistent progression but retaining the traits that made him the warm human being from the original 'Rocky'. This time through, tragedy and hardship drives Rocky even further. His 'training scenes' are a hallmark of Rocky movies but rather than watching him run up steps followed by hundreds of admirers, or working up a sweat in the gym, we see him alone, trudging through snow, climbing steep mountains and chopping wood in vicious conditions whilst his opponent trains with superior technology, comfort and assistance. What makes it so unforgettable is how true it is to Rocky's spirit and drive to 'go the distance', even more than running up 1000 steps or doing 1000 push ups, as well as depictive of the inspirational take away from the films. <br/><br/>Much has been made of the political propaganda within the movie but it fails to sway Rocky. Ultimately, it doesn't take over the film as much as provide a fitting backdrop and concludes in a manner true to Rocky.<br/><br/>Stallone is, as always, supported by the stellar talents of Talia Shire, Burt Young and Carl Weathers whilst even the Russian contingent led by Brigitte Nielson and Michael Pataki are extremely believable. <br/><br/>The question on everyone's lips is, does it beat the original? I would say that they are two different films at two different junctures, the first created a revered character whilst this one fulfilled him."

","Is four a lucky number when it comes to the most successful sports franchise of all-time? Well, regarding the box-office score, yes, the fourth opus of the ""Rocky"" series is the highest grossing and this is a fact. If it is the best is another matter. While this honor goes either to the opening or the concluding film in my opinion, it's not the worst either, and it carries a little charm getting more palpable after each viewing, granted you know you're not watching a film on the same caliber as ""Rocky"", THE masterpiece.<br/><br/>I think the 'charm' thing has to do with the cult status of the film, something that defines the 80's in such a flashy way, it's almost blinding. ""Rocky IV"" works as a kaleidoscope of all the cinematic stereotypes of the 80's, name one, you'll find it. First, by being (not another) sequel, the film incarnates one of the 80's most obvious trends, the necessary continuation of a money-making series. We forgive the musical montage since it's almost a trademark of the series, and ""Rocky IV""'s training montage is particularly well done, the sight of Rocky Balboa climbing the frozen peaks of Russian mountains is dizzyingly inspiring and one of the franchise's best shot. We have the one-dimensional antagonist, through Ivan Drago, furthermore from Soviet Russia, the greatest cinematic propaganda villains' providers before September Eleven. Drago defines the film's age and his evilness is defined by one of the cruelest movie deaths after Bambi's mom: Apollo Creed. ""Rocky IV"" is infamous for being the one where the glorious and charismatic Apollo is killed, so Rocky can get on the ring and take good old revenge, the most overused plot device of the sport genre.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the movie clichés, but these are the most blatant ones, and I even forgive the speaking robot offered to Paulie for his birthday, it was the 80's, when we thought we would all be in flying cars in the 2000's. All the archetypal elements I defined don't ruin the film, but they create a huge gap in quality with what the first opus stood for, a movie beyond all the traditional representations. ""Rocky"" didn't need to win but to go the distance, Apollo was cocky but not evil, the montage was about building resistance not becoming a superhuman, and certainly not the revenge on a dead friend. Yes, I have a problem with Apollo's death, because it's so unlike the values incarnated by the series that it feels forced. I guess Stallone thought : ""Rocky needs a good reason to get back on the ring again"" then he thought of a terminator-like opponent, Dolph Lundgren as Drago, the pride of USSR, a powerful athlete training with the most modern equipment and not without use of steroids, USSR so he can challenge America (Cold War days). And who's the most openly American on the heavyweight competition? Bingo. Apollo gets in the rings to get out of it two feet ahead. We have our pivotal moment..<br/><br/>To make it simpler, my problem with ""Rocky IV"" is that I started appreciating the film only after Apollo's death; the beginning was an artificially written build-up that doesn't match the quality of the rest of the film. And that's symptomatic of most of the sequels, they end up better than they started, I thought Adrian's coma and Rocky's struggle to find a job were too long in the second film, the training for Lang's fight in the third proved that obviously Rocky wasn't in the best shape to win, and the movie got better when Mickey died and Apollo trained Rocky. ""Rocky IV"" sins with the same problem of obviousness, we know Drago will destroy Apollo, Apollo's pretension is so blatant it's like he forgot that he was beaten two years in a row, you'd think it would have taught him a lesson of humility. Apollo didn't even have the 'eye of the tiger' because he acted like a caricature of the first Apollo, with the whole 'Living in America' parade, James Brown, stars and striped short. We're always ahead of the characters and know what would happen, Stallone with an Oscar nomination for writing proved to have a talent to come up with inventive ideas, but in the ""Rocky sequels, he always seem more inspired in the second acts, probably confident that the ending would redeem the flaws in the beginning..<br/><br/>And he's not totally wrong, the ""Rocky"" films always have been about the ending, and the climactic fight, whose patriotically austere undertones contrasts with the flashiness of the first one, features probably one of the most painful to watch fights, yet awesome and entertaining. Rocky's journey in Russia becomes the reason to be of the film, and although the ending doesn't surprise us, it's handled with a positive message, here comes the 'we can change' speech, that sounds rather naive now, but doesn't deprive the film from a poignant humanistic value. I only wish it could have encouraged Stallone to write a less formulaic story, although it contains some unforgettable lines such as ""If he dies, he dies"", Duke's repeated ""No pain"" catchphrase, the classic ""I must break you"" followed by probably one of my Top 10 lines from the film when Paulie tells Rocky: ""Remember what I said back there about wanting to be you?"" Rocky nods, Paulies says: ""Forget it."" Apollo is no more with us, but thank God we have Paulie for the laughs, and Adrian for the heart.<br/><br/>(On a last note, I always tried to point my finger on what the movie lacked besides the writing, and I remember that I always thought the movie featured the song ""The Final Countdown"" one of the most defining music of the 80's, I was disappointed not to hear the song in ""Rocky IV"" and I guess it would have been a huge contribution to the film, had it been used.)"

","Rocky IV is an interesting film as far as the opinions of fans go. Many praise it for differing from the original and obtaining its own individual charm whilst others condemn it for the very same reason. Personally, I've always loved Rocky IV and I may even prefer it to Rocky Balboa despite the fact that it is far inferior as far as a good screenplay goes. Rocky IV deviates from the dramatic prospects that made the first two Rocky films so fantastic and instead follows in the popcorn action flick direction introduced in Rocky III, but goes even further and on to becoming one of those ridiculous macho man action movies from the 80s like Commando that is also riddled with Cold War propaganda. It's very different, but lovable in its own silly way.<br/><br/>The film begins with a flashback of the fight at the end of the previous movies like all Rocky movies seem to do. We learn that Rocky's friend, Apollo Creed is coming out of retirement for an exhibition match with a powerful Russian boxer named Ivan Drago. Apollo feels obligated to go ahead with fighting due to his patriotism and sadly ends up being killed by Drago. Rocky is devastated by this and chooses to fight Drago himself and he travels to the Soviet Union in order to train for the upcoming fight.<br/><br/>Drop your expectation that you will get a Rocky movie with real dramatic substance, this one has descended into utter silliness and is nothing more than just an action movie. In that regard, it is pretty good. Stallone delivers a great performance as Rocky like he always has and Carl Weathers was still great as Apollo Creed during his screen time, but unfortunately Adrian and Paulie are given very little to do outside of just supporting Rocky on his endeavors so their character development has gone downhill.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and montages that accompany them are wonderful. Even though the classic composition of Bill Conti is absent, Rocky IV introduces a rock and pop soundtrack that I find to be great. The songs by Survivor, Vince Dicola, Robert Tepper and John Cafferty are all wonderful and I still listen to them quite regularly. The montage of Rocky training in the Russian wilderness is also a very nice change to juxtapose with the montages in the previous films.<br/><br/>The Cold War aspects are very interesting too, even though they are sometimes quite silly. The portrayal of Drago as a quiet, Frankenstein-like brute is unusual, but I appreciate that they tried to make the character seem monstrous to compliment his superhuman strength. In general, I just think that it was really cool to see the screenplay adapt itself to a suitable period in history. Another moment when the Soviet people 'boo' Rocky and show strong patriotism for their country when their anthem plays before the match is no doubt an interesting scene, but I'm actually somewhat confused that they would present the Soviets in such a negative way, but have Rocky give a speech for peace between the USA and the USSR. Merely a question that remains unanswered in my mind.<br/><br/>Rocky IV isn't the sort of movie you take seriously. The serious drama has been drained and has been replaced with action, music and montages and some propaganda, but it has developed a charm of its own and can be heavily enjoyed despite some shortcomings. Rocky IV is a great movie and a solid installment in this wonderful franchise.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The first film was brilliant, the second film wasn't bad, and the third film I think is a little underrated, but this is to me where the series started to sag, from the leading actor also directing, and winning a Razzie for doing so, Sylvester Stallone. Basically the film continues once again from where it left off, where Rocky Balboa (Razzie winning Stallone) had defeated Clubber Lang with the help and training of once opponent now good friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers). Rocky is still bathing in the glory of being the Heavyweight Champion of the World, and then he hears of a new big star boxer from Russia, scientifically trained, with high tech equipment, the seemingly unbeatable Cpt. Ivan Drago (introducing Dolph Lundgren). Despite being out of the boxing ring for a few years, Apollo tells a fearful Rocky he will taking on the Russian adversary, and there was good reason to fear as Apollo is beaten to death in the match. Rocky blames himself for the death of his friend, and when he slowly starts to get himself back together he promises to avenge his death in the ring with Drago, but to do this he has to go to his home country. So he, Adrian (Razzie nominated Talia Shire) and Paulie (Razzie nominated Burt Young) travel to the USSR, and it seems for quite a while spend most of their time in the snow contemplating and stuff, while Drago and his wife Ludmilla Vobet (twice Razzie winning Brigitte Nielsen) promote themselves. After the usual montage of Rocky running and training, not once but twice or three times, too much, help from Apollo's former manager Duke (Tony Burton), and an argument and make-up with Adrian, he seems ready to fight. Finally it comes to the boxing match in this new country, Rocky is seemingly defending his title as well as being intent on destroying Drago, and obviously the fight goes on for over ten rounds, but when it looks hopeless he triumphs in the end. Also starring Michael Pataki as Nicoli Koloff, James Brown as Himself - The Godfather of Soul and Rocky Krakoff as Rocky Jr. Stallone is still reasonable as the up and down boxer, Shire is still okay as his concerned, and Weathers while he was on was alright too, there is a little something missing with the absence of Burgess Meredith. Well, the whole film has something missing, zing, it just feels all the same thing to the point where it is tiresome, especially the montage bits with different music, and the ridiculous long scenes in the snow are boring as hell, in fact, almost the whole is boring as hell, a pretty lacklustre boxing drama sequel. It won the Razzie for Worst Musical Score for Vince DiCola, and it was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Adequate!"

","Rocky's rumbles with Apollo Creed and Clubber Lang were entertaining enough, but in this movie he finally goes for the real enemy: communism! If you thought parts II & III were cheesefests, you were right, but you ain't seen nothing yet. In this movie Rocky Balboa appears to single-handedly end the Cold War, is there anything this guy can't do? This entry has the same ingredients all the other ones have, but all of these ingredients are turned up a notch for the sake of pure awesomeness. The obligatory bigger, stronger opponent? A Soviet-trained Dolph Lundgren. If you can think of any living creature more lethal and powerful than that, stay the hell away from it. The training montage? Really long, really cool, and as ""inspirational"" as only the best and cheesiest 80s sports movies can be. Even the inevitable synth pop soundtrack is great in this one. The only part I didn't care about at all in this sequel: the drama aspect. Paulie and Adrian were more than tolerable in the earlier ones, but here they're just bland and lame. The kid isn't interesting either, and the less said about the robot the better. Sorry Sly, but you kinda suck at writing comic relief. It's not too bothersome though, this movie is still incredibly fun."

","The first twenty minutes of Rocky IV is interesting, which is mainly focused on his friend Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) who see a Russian champion boxer who is going to take part in a charity event. Creed wants to get back into the ring after five years but Rocky (Stallone) warns him not to but Creed insists so Rocky helps him. Cut to the fight where the Americans make a big spectacle of signing before the fight with Creed hamming it up for the crowd. Then the fight begins and it becomes brutal and Creed is killed in the ring. Rocky is devastated and wants revenge against the Russian boxer so he agrees to go to Russia to fight him where he trains with the help of Creed's old coach. And that's it really. This is even shorter than Rocky III only reaching an hour and a half. Stallone again gives a great performance as does Talia Shire as Adrian though she has little screen time, you can tell she loves her husband very much with supporting him. Also Burt Young as Paulie gets a few good comedy moments to do with a robot that is programmed to help him out.<br/><br/>Carl Weathers returning the last time as Creed gives an entertaining performance with the time his on the screen, but I didn't think much of the Russian boxer. He dosen't say much and is quite boring though he is a fearsome adversary in terms of physically. There is a lovely montage of flashback when Rocky is driving his car with memories of his friendship with Creed and his own rise to fame with the brilliant song of ""Eye of the Tiger"" What I liked about Rocky IV more than III is the fight felt more personal and as a result after growing fond of Apollo Creed in Rocky III and the blossoming friendship between them. I wanted Rocky to beat the Russian boxer and that inspired me in the fight, which made it better to watch. The fight is absolutely brutal but it also demonstrates the clear divide between East and West, Russia and America in the Cold War. Though Russia hate Rocky at first they soon cheer for him. In the end this fourth instalment was better than the third and even though these last two can't match Rocky's I and II, they are good enough and I look forward to Rocky V."

Drago is so powerful that he knocked out Apollo and killed him. Rocky got really angry so he decided to have a boxing match with Draco.

","You would think that by this time the series would go downhill but it doesn't. Sylvester stallone, Talia shire, Burt young, Carl weathers and introducing Dolph lundgren all star once again in Rocky 4. This movie takes place a little after the third movie after Rocky had just faced for what has to be his most powerful opponent Clubber lang. A Russian fighter by the name of Ivan drago (Dolph lundgren) comes to America with his wife and the Russian politicians. Rocky's now good friend Apollo creed wants to fight this new Russian because he feels that the russians are trying to make them look bad. Apollo believes that once your a fighter that is who you are and people can't change. Rocky doesn't really like the idea of Apollo fighting Drago right away because they know nothing about him.<br/><br/>Apollo decides to make one hell of an entrance before his fight with Drago but in the end he won't be making much of an exit. Drago kills apollo literally in the second round and rocky goes into another depression and he decides to fight Drago in Russia and of course Adrain (Talia shire) disapproves because she saw what Drago is capable of. Rocky said that he's a fighter and thats the way he's made and he goes to Russia without Adrian and brings Paulie (Burt young) and tony duke(Apollo's trainer Tony burton) and Duke trains rocky in Russia.<br/><br/>Rocky has no real equipment in Russia and Rocky trains ghetto like sawing wood and chopping down trees and running up a mountain while Drago on the other hand has all the high tech equipment and sparring partners and he takes steroids. Adrian eventually comes down to Russia to support rocky. The biggest fight of rocky's life is now on and at first the Russian fans boo and jeer at rocky but it wasn't until they saw rocky's determination and heart that they started cheering for him.<br/><br/>Really good 4th entry in the series and this had my favorite music. Dolph lundgren was very intimidating and mysterious as the Russian fighter Ivan drago. Yeah this movie was probably the most unrealistic in the series but thats what makes it fun. Love it 10/10"

","In this third sequel to the 1976 original ""Rocky"", Sylvester Stallone continues the story of America's greatest boxer. After beating Apollo Creed in ""Rocky II"", then Clubber Lang in ""Rocky III"", Rocky is going to have the greatest fight of his life. This time he is representing the United States as he goes against the USSR's top boxer, Ivan Drago, a 6'4"" boxer who has a punch of 2000 PSI. The story starts out of course with the end to the last fight against Clubber Lang where Rocky regains the title that is rightfully his. Now Rocky lives in a huge mansion with Adrian and his son, Rocky Jr. He has cars, money, and lives a luxury. Then one day, new arrival from Russia, Ivan Drago comes to American to enter professional boxing. Drago wants a exhibition match with Rocky. But Apollo Creed wants a piece of the man first. So the first fight is Creed vs. Drago. The results of this fight are not good. So Rocky decides to go after Drago and fight him in Russia. Adrian is convinced herself that Rocky can't win against this man. Rocky and Paulie go to Russia alone out in the middle of nowhere to train with Apollo's old trainer, Tony. The training scenes in this movie are great as the scenes flip back and forth showing each fighter's training techniques. Drago is training in a high-tech facility while Rocky is training in the deep snows of Russia by chopping wood in one swing, pulling sleds on his hands and kness, and running up mountains in the snow. Rocky now is ready for the fight of his life. He is not only fighting for himself but for the pride of his country. Will the United States win again? Buy this DVD and see what a fighter Rocky really is. This sequel has it all. Great fighting scenes, great plot, great character development and is overall a great sequel to the Rocky collection."

","Rocky IV represents a time in American cinema that doesn't exist anymore. Even with the recent years bringing America's ""War on Terror"", nothing really comes close to America's years of US vs the Russians propaganda. While John Wayne was still in his grave in 1985, Sylvester Stallone took up the mantel with two films that year that, to him at least, were created to galvanize the good ol' American spirit of kicking ass in foreign territory. Indeed, there isn't too much of a line of subtle difference to draw between Rambo: First Blood Part II and Rocky IV. Both feature Stallone's quintessential TOUGH stars, who have lots of conflict but, save for the first film in their respective franchises, aren't really very large and looming. But if you'd rather not have the rabid onslaught of senseless murder in Rambo, just go for the onslaught of senseless training montage and all-Americana vs *very* scary Russian imagery.<br/><br/>Oh, this is such slanted stuff, the kind of material that is like the last flailing erection of an America reigned by the Regan administration. But why not have some fun with it? Rocky IV is so silly that it somehow is able to top the adrenaline-reigning montages of Rocky III (and that had ""Eye of the Tiger"" so you know what you're getting into), and its silliness with Mr. T and Hulk Hogan, two non-boxers fighting in the ring. Rocky IV is all about the supposedly unstoppable Russian, propped up by a Russian government and society that looks to be the cinematic expression of one of those PSA's from the 1950s. And to compound this America vs Russia 'thing', at first Apollo Creed decides to fight Drago, only to tumble to his doom, under the limelight of James Brown's ""Living in America"" no less! <br/><br/>You'll be one of two audiences with Rocky IV: you'll either be, somehow, actually pumped up by all of this brawn vs brawn stuff, with Stallone's very unlikely run up a mountain (yes, a frigging mountain) contrasted with the kind of training regiment for Lundgren's big giant that it would make the Terminator wince, or you'll have a lot of laughs and bewildered exchanges with your friends or loved ones. I fall into the latter, but it doesn't necessarily make Rocky IV a ""bad"" movie. It's sense of montage and hilariously stupid 80s songs are shoddy at times, specifically the first of many as Stallone drives in the car and sees clips of ALL of the past movies. But its heart is strong and fierce, and its sense of its one-sided stance of Americana (which even includes things like rich Americans having the right to have funny robots) turns into a guilty pleasure that's hard to ignore, if you're in the right mood.<br/><br/>Then again, it is a good thing things like this aren't around really anymore... much. Even Stallone kept Rocky Balboa (2006's ""final"" Rocky) more squared on the character and history than on politics, and even 2008's Rambo was more centered on a conflict in Burma that seemed ideal for a disillusioned outcast like old Rambo. But as a time capsule, it could be a lot worse. It could be Rocky V! And, thankfully, it is not."
"CandidlyCandid","Null","0","2","3 March 2009"," Montages And Violence: That's It
","The two words ""Montages"" & ""Violence"", pretty much sums up Rocky IV. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing; Rocky IV is full of exciting, pumped up montages that'll make you want to cut a tree down with an Axe, or run up a snow mountain. You can't compare Rocky IV to Rocky (the original), Rocky IV has got the easiest of plots and it just naturally executed through boxing, violence and montages. Not one can take this movie seriously, and define it as a masterpiece; because it doesn't have one classifier that you could consider this a masterpiece. Its basically the same characters from the first three, and the same acting (which really wasn't that good). This is more of a music video, with some boxing fights and catchy music, which isn't a bad thing, but its something that we can't describe as a 'serious' movie, more of a fan-made entertaining film."

","Don't get me wrong, this is an entirely entertaining movie, but by the time this one came out, the Rocky series was definitely running out of steam. Once again we find our lovable protagonist in the ""fight of his life"" going up against a villain of super-human proportions. And once again he must overcome insurmountable odds to reclaim victory. This time Rocky isn't just battling for personal glory, but for freedom and democracy through-out the globe. The Cold War is an obvious inspiration for this derivation of the Rocky formula.<br/><br/>In this outing, Rocky must face his greatest foe yet: a seven-foot tall Russian of unimaginable strength, Ivan Drago. You see, Drago visits the United States to begin his career in professional boxing and desires to begin with the reigning champ, Rocky Balboa. However, Apollo Creed, thirsting for another bout in the ring, jumps at this chance to rekindle his warrior's fire. So, after reluctantly agreeing to help his friend prepare for this seemingly easy exhibition match, Rocky watches in horror as Apollo is brutally cut down by the Russian. So now the rather thin plot of the movie unfolds. Rocky must face his inner demons and journey to Russia and defeat his friend's killer.<br/><br/>It's pretty much by the numbers, not really straying from the Rocky formula. Nonetheless, Stallone is still able to produce a film that is watchable. He has basically taken the same concept of the original three movies and stripped it down to the bare bones, replacing cheesy montages for characterization and broad themes for introspection. One example of gloss over substance is a montage of Rocky dealing with his feelings after Apollo's death. It's like five minutes of clips from previous Rocky movies, even interspersing footage from earlier in Rocky IV! Did they really think that a overly long montage could replace some seriously needed emotional depth? I guess they saved a few bucks not having to film any original material. But somehow it all still works. There are two training montages, both with Rocky in the unforgiving Russian wilderness, paralleled with Drago's training sessions in laboratories with high tech machinery. They are both pretty effective. <br/><br/>Yes, the symbolism in this film are like broad paint brush strokes of two contrasting colors. Rocky is pretty straight ahead with little growth going on here. Yeah, he has to deal with his friend's death, but it's not like we hadn't seen this somber, sobering side of Rocky in the other three movies. Rocky and Creed's friendship was basically reduced to watching old reels of their fights together and calling each other by their nicknames. I couldn't count how many times Apollo referred to Rocky simply as ""Stallion."" Adrian's role in this movie was basically reduced to the disapproving then supportive spouse who gives Rocky that final push of inspiration to overcome. Gone is the affable wall flower of the earlier movies. She is basically a cardboard version of her earlier incarnations. Paulie is there to basically complain about everything.<br/><br/>Stallone also missed a chance with his villain, in my opinion. Drago, portrayed well by Dolph Lundgren, is a physically impressive heavy, but that is about it. He has a few lines, though they are some pretty good one liners, but other than that Rocky could have just been fighting a Kodiak bear for all that it mattered. There are hints that this character is more than just a brutish fighting machine. Perhaps Stallone left this up for the viewer to decide if Ivan Drago is really evil, unlike Mr. T's Clubber Lange from the earlier movie who was overtly so, but in the end he seems as flat and uninspired as the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The final fight is rather anticlimactic. The actual choreography is pretty shoddy as you can tell some of the hits aren't even close to connecting. No one ever blocks a punch, except maybe with their face, and there is no emotion here. Yeah, their corners are screaming at their respective fighters, and Rocky and Drago exchange some intense looks from across the ring, but it really adds up to not much as we know that Rocky isn't going to lose. In fact, after taking a beating from a fighter who registers 2000 psi per punch, and killed Creed in less than two rounds, Rocky seems less beat up than he did from his first fight with Apollo. Whatever.<br/><br/>As I was watching this movie again recently, I was wondering what exactly the final message was. It starts off like a pretty straight forward revenge flick of sorts, but near the end, Rocky is giving a speech to the entire USSR about change and brotherhood or something. I guess on further exploration, it could be trying to say that in the end, our emotions shouldn't rule our decision making and that we all have room to change, e.g. Apollo trying to regain his glory and impulsively entering a fight he couldn't win, Rocky pursuing revenge even though it wouldn't bring his friend back, and I guess even to a lesser extent Drago desiring to demolish his enemies in a sport that doesn't necessarily warrant it. <br/><br/>But who am I kidding. This film doesn't require or even request its' viewers to think that deep, unlike the original. It thrives on pure adrenaline, with a pumping sound track and fast paced montages. All in all, there is about half of a real movie here. Stallone should have stopped right here, but I guess if people still love watching the underdog movies, even at the most superficial level, why end a sure thing?<br/><br/>One last thought: Wouldn't it have been cool if Rocky went into the fight sporting that sweet beard he was growing there while training? Would have shown how raw he got out there in Siberia or wherever the hell he was. Now that would have been change we all could agree on!"
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","0","2","26 November 2008"," USA vs. Russia at the heart of the cold war
","Rocky 4 strikes me as a combination between a traditional Rocky film and an over the top 80s action movie. It seems that the Soviet Union has finally officially entered the world of professional wrestling, entering a contestant in the form of Ivan Drago, a stolid mass of scientifically trained punching machinery, played with effective stoniness by Dolph Lundgren.<br/><br/>Creed and Rocky are undeniable boxing rock stars by now, as is unquestionably illustrated when we see that Creed learns about the arrival of the scary Russian one lazy afternoon when he's watching TV from his POOL. I didn't know people watched TV in their backyards during the day while lounging in their pool. Isn't the screen a little difficult to see with the sunlight?<br/><br/>No matter, because soon we learn that Drago can throw punches that deliver the intricately measured force of 2150 pounds per square INCH. It's interesting that this installment in the Rocky series has made the effort to actually measure and describe the force of the punches landing on our hero's head, but I calculate that the man's fists, with gloves, are roughly six square inches at the impact zone. Now, if my calculations are correct, at more than a TON per square inch, every single punch would send Rocky or any other human being doing backflips into the audience behind him.<br/><br/>The point of all this force, however, is that Drago is a machine, the man is barely human, he's a biological experiment that the Russians have hooked up to innumerable different pieces of equipment and trained to be literally a scientifically flawless fighting machine. <br/><br/>Apollo, however, is the one that loses his cool, not Rocky. At a press conference, Apollo loses his temper and berates the Russians in public, himself challenging Drago to a fight. Evidently he hasn't learned anything from the first two movies, because he lets his confidence run away with him, and again puts on an elaborate, ridiculous dance when he enters the arena. <br/><br/>Of course, this whole fight is designed to generate anger from Rocky towards the Russian, and to show how little humanity Drago has left in him after all those years of scientifically guided training. They have trained the human being out of him, and someone needs to beat it back in. <br/><br/>Notably, this is the first time real revenge has been a motive for Rocky. The fight between Apollo and Drago was supposed to be another spectacle fight, just a show to raise money and attention, but clearly Drago didn't understand that or didn't care. <br/><br/>At any rate, Rocky demands a chance to fight Drago, but the Russians insist that the fight has to be in Russia because Drago has received too many death threats. This leads to lots of footage of Rocky training alone in the freezing cold of a Russian winter juxtaposed with images of Drago training in a nice warm lab surrounded by scientists. It's hardly fair!!<br/><br/>Adrian, as before, is highly unhappy about the fight. She doesn't want Rocky to fight anymore because she's worried that one of these days he is going to be seriously hurt, and justifiably so. Rocky has taken more than his share of beatings over the years, and a Russian who can deliver the weight of small cars with his fists is not the kind of person I would want to get in the ring with either!<br/><br/>Part 4 is the first Rocky movie that had a noticeably and ridiculously cheesy musical montage, cutting in footage from the older movies and giving me the feeling that they just needed to pad the movie for sufficient running time. I can't think of any movie I've ever seen where a cheesy music video was put in and added anything to the story or made the movie better in any way. And there are two in this movie!<br/><br/>At any rate, I appreciated that the Russians assigned Rocky with two ""escorts"" who followed him wherever he went. I have been living in Communist China for two years, and trust me, the feeling of being watched never goes away and is never unjustified!<br/><br/>The fight itself, however, is definitely one of the most exciting of the series so far. Drago comes on like a machine, he is completely invincible and beats Rocky around the ring like a kid. The crowd, meanwhile, cheers against him. He's totally alone out there in the dead of winter in a foreign country, and it's not hard to feel a little scared for him. <br/><br/>But the important thing is that, despite what Drago says, both fighters respect the other's physical perfection. Rocky says that he sees three of Drago out there (""Hit the one in the middle!""), and Drago tells his trainers that Rocky is ""like a piece of iron."" Mutual respect changes the meaning of a fight like this drastically. It makes it much better. <br/><br/>I am curious to know how the movie was received in Russia, because the Russians behind Drago are clearly the villains of the movie, and the story presents them as representations of the Russian government. Te ""escorts"" that followed Rocky around are nothing more than spies (the real life ones are not impressive either), and the movie ends with an impressive but preachy speech about the importance of overcoming nationalist differences and people coming together. <br/><br/>But preachy or not, the movie is still inspirational even after the Soviet Union has collapsed, even though it has gone much too far, ah, 'over the top' in the exaggeration of reality department. While the original film is remembered as a boxing film that's not about boxing, part 4 is an action film that IS about boxing"

","Though older, how is it choreographed that a former world champion cannot dodge or block a single telegraphed punch? Drago threw no jabs, just lifted up his hand and punched with about a two second delay. Dodging at least one punch would have made the fight more believable and becoming of a great fighter like Creed.<br/><br/>The fight also would have been more realistic if Drago had thrown fewer punches and simply ""caught"" Creed in a bad situation. Anyone with half a heart would have just run in the ring and stopped the fight a long time before, despite what Creed had said.<br/><br/>Also, it would have been nice to give him a new outfit. Showing up in the same outfit that he wore 9 years ago at he and Rocky's first fight is a bit unbecoming as well.<br/><br/>Apollo Creed is the true anchor of the Rocky series whose character development means the most to the series."

","I have now seen four of the first five ""Rocky"" movies. I still have the third to go. But I can say that this was the least entertaining of the four so far. Not the worst, because it wasn't all bad.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is the birthday party for Uncle Paulie. I like the warm family moments, especially when they are funny. And I like that robot that Rocky gives Uncle Paulie as a present. And I like Uncle Paulie and Rocky's son. Adrian is quite pretty. The actors playing all three do a good job.<br/><br/>In second place, although I don't like boxing (which is why I've taken so long to see these movies), is watching Rocky persevere against Drago. I can't stand watching the guy get beat up so badly. How can anyone take so much punishment and still keep fighting? And yet he does. It's a pleasure to see him actually wear down Drago.<br/><br/>Sylvester Stallone gives a good performance overall here. Sure, this isn't a classic, but it's not terrible. Carl Weathers is even better, though to me his reaction to Drago is overdone (part of that is writing). And certainly what happened to Apollo in the ring was too much. But it does give Rocky an incentive.<br/><br/>Brigitte Nielsen and Michael Pataki give good performances as well. As for Dolph Lundgren, he does an amazing job of just looking tough and fierce, but for the most part Drago shows no emotion. In one exciting sequence where he and Rocky are both shown training in separate locations, he does show some determination. And toward the end of his fight with Rocky, Drago no longer appears to be a robot. I wouldn't call that good acting, though.<br/><br/>For those who started with this movie, that would be unfortunate because you're not seeing how good the others are. But there are flashbacks at one point, with music but no sound, to help explain what has happened.<br/><br/>The music in this movie is certainly not my taste. The familiar theme from the first two movies is not in it, to my knowledge, though the Survivor theme from the third movie is pretty good. Most of the rest of the songs, as opposed to background music, sound like garbage to me. James Brown's performance in the typical Vegas introduction to the first fight shows ""He's still got it"" as of the making of this movie, but it's still not the sort of thing I like. Wayne Newton, Frank Sinatra, or any number of Vegas-style musicians would have pleased me more.<br/><br/>There is some beautiful scenery in Russia (actually Canada).<br/><br/>Anyway, if you enjoyed the other movies, you might consider this a letdown, or you might enjoy this more because some of what made the others good is here."

I told him that he was wrong about the American Viewer's interest. I also told him that I've been in America since 1975 and have seen that there was a huge interest in what Russian people are all about.

I told him to take advantage of that opportunity and make movie. At that time I was working as a weekend governess for Sylvester.

"slightlymad22","8","0","2","4 January 2007"," The Least 'Rocky' Movie Of The Rocky Franchise
","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in order, I come to Rocky IV.<br/><br/>I will say right from the off, this movie is the greatest cinematic going experience of my life. Nothing even comes close. The double header of 'Rocky 3' and 'First Blood' gave Stallone the best year of his career in 1982. After flopping big time in 1984 with Rhinestone, as the new muscle man on the block Arnold Schwarzenegger scored big with The Terminator. Stallone hoped lightning would strike twice in 1985 with the pairing of the patriotic 'Rambo: First Blood Part 2' and even more patriotic 'Rocky IV' The whole plot of Rocky IV could be put on the back of a postage stamp, so my usual plot in a paragraph part will be tricky, but here we go.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Apollo dies in a boxing match with a Russian. Rocky seeks revenge. Nothing else happens.<br/><br/>This is the least 'Rocky' of all the Rocky movies. Stallone is nothing like the Rocky character of the previous movies. It's basically Just Stallone being Stallone. This is the only Rocky film where the music is not composed by Bill Conti. No 'Gonna Fly Now' no Museum steps, in fact no Philadelphia at all. This is also the only Rocky film that doesn't begin with the word ""ROCKY"" scrolling across the screen in some shape or form. But more damagingly it lacks any real heart. <br/><br/>But despite the fact that the film is wafer thin, unrealistic and pretty silly, I still can't help but love Rocky IV. Stallone really took to the MTV style of editing in 'Rocky 3' and does it again here, with the training montages, Survivor/James Brown/Robert Tepper tunes, etc. very well. I personally enjoyed the contrasts-see Stallone chop wood. See Drago pump iron. See Stallone run across a snowy field. See Drago run on an Olympic treadmill. See Stallone do crunches while half-suspended from a loft. See Drago bend every conceivable advanced weight machine outta shape as he flexes and trains. See Stallone eat his spinach. See Drago take his Steroids....<br/><br/>Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rambo and Rocky movies back to back, and it shows. I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here. One of the silliest things about Rocky IV is the fact that it's basically just one big music video – it should have been renamed Rocky: The Musical.Whenever a bit of character development is called for another music video kicks in.Apollo's is whipping up patriotism 'living in America' Oh, Apollo's dead? We'll have a music video of Rocky moodily driving his car ('There's no easy way out'). Oh, Rocky's got to go to Russia? We'll have shots of Russian soldiers and we'll play some pop song about two worlds colliding ""Two worlds collide, rival nations.""<br/><br/>But ignore that and watch it again and try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the summer of 85. I remember I was 8 and my sister took me to see it.I remember the place was packed and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place. When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells "" he's cut, he's cut! "" the crowd went into a frenzy. And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular. It doesn't matter if you are American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us. That is the beauty of Rocky. If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.<br/><br/>"" Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!""<br/><br/>On my normal scoring chart this would rate a 7. But childhood nostalgia bumps it up to a generous 8"

I've seen this movie before, but I saw it on TV the other night and I watched for a solid hour. I caught myself feeling very nervous for poor underdog Rocky against the burly Commie. I caught myself being riled up as Rocky was training to the back-beat of god-awful 80s pump-up music. This is a scary feeling, but I bet everyone has these feelings. I've heard many people say how Top Gun is a terrible movie, but can't pry themselves away from the TV when it is on. Back to Rocky, I gave a mediocre score to this movie because although it is horribly clichéd and cheesy, I can't refuse it's underdog charm. Perhaps Rocky IV would have been better if it wasn't for the stupid speech at the end. It would seem that fall of the Soviet Union was based on Rocky alone. Who knows, maybe it was."

","Now I'm not claiming that Rocky IV is one of the great movies of all time, yet it is truly a popcorn movie to watch when you want to escape into the realm of 1980's, anti- communist, montage laden soup operas. It is truly the Rocky movies taken to the nth degree, with all its hedonistic glory. You not only have the famed death of Apollo Creed but a show down for the ages when Rocky must pummel not just another human, but the Soviet Union itself, single handy helping bring down communism(Yes its true, as Uncle Tom's Cabin was to slavery, Rocky IV was to communism). Everything in the movie is over the top, from James Brown singing ""Living in America"" with Apollo Creed coming down to the ring on a giant rams head, to Rocky running up a mountain in the middle of Siberia. Sylvestor Stallone(who did the triple threat as writer, director, and lead actor) takes this movie to where no Rocky movie can ever compare. One can not take it literally and point out all its flaws, which there are numerous, but must just sit back and enjoy the glorious ride. The original Rocky was a small story about a boxer from the mean streets of Philly, Rocky IV is a Shakespearian drama done in MTV styling and with TV movie like acting. Yes I did just compare Rocky IV to Shakespeare, what are you going to do about it? So in the end don't just watch this movie, experience it as a moment in cinema history that will never be repeated.

","Stallone was the ultimate anti-Russian actor of the 1980s (see also ""Rambo III""). Since we're at peace now, some of his films have become rather embarrassing. ""Rocky IV"" is obviously a case of ""us"" against ""them,"" and by the final reel, even the Russians are rooting for Rocky the all-American hero. Very strange indeed, especially given the series' roots in serious drama.<br/><br/>A Russian friend once noticed this film on my DVD shelf (I must confess that I bought it for completeness). I put on a grim face and said to her, ""I'll never forgive you b****rds for killing Apollo Creed!"" Thankfully, she knew that I was making fun of the movie, and not Russians.<br/><br/>The only highlight? Apollo, of course, who steals the middle entries in this series.

"willmccarty","8","0","1","23 October 2003"," I've watched it more times than any human should...
","Let me first preface my history with this movie.  The fascination for the Rocky series has been present since childhood.  Some of my earliest memories include seeing this movie and seeing Tyson knock out Spinks.  Boxing has always been a passion.  Movies have always been a passion.  Thus, the Rocky series has always held a special place on my list of favorite movies (Rocky V excluded, but that's an entirely different topic).<br/><br/>If you had just seen the original for the first time, Rocky IV will mean nothing to you.  It will let you down.  This movie should be viewed in the context of its time, not of its origin.  The one-time street bum is now seen with a beautiful house and a Lamborghini.  He's proven his status of being one of the great champs of all time.  Clearly this movie will add nothing to the series.  Or will it?<br/><br/>First, let me comment on the villain.  Ivan Drago is basically a portrait of character actor Dolph Lundgren.  This time, the gigantic Scandinavian is portraying the great Russian hope.  The great stereotypes of the cold war are all in full effect as Drago is a genetically engineered, roided-up, indestructible communist threat.  First, he kills one American icon, Apollo Creed (portrayed again by Carl Weathers), with nothing but his fists.  He then sets his sights on the great American underdog, Rocky Balboa.  Of course, to go along with the whole Cold War feel, Rocky overcomes the odds to finish the Russian, win the match, and convince every Soviet, including the Soviet Premiere, that we're all the same and should live and love one another.  It's corny.  It's predictable.  It's classic Reagan-era pro-American propaganda.  And for this, we thank Stallone.<br/><br/>Next, let me comment on the characters of the movie.  This movie, like the second and third installment, is written and directed by Stallone himself. The movie continues, like the others, by continuing off the prior installment.  However, the characters have been developed to death. Everyone knows Rocky.  Everyone knows Adrian.  Everyone knows Paulie. Everyone who returns has been developed.  Thus, the first forty minutes of the movie is spent developing four main characters, three of which are Russian.  The fourth, however, is another great product of the 1980s. Early in the movie, the Balboa family is celebrating Paulie's birthday.  Thus, like every rich family in America in the 1980s, the only respectable birthday gift for a grumpy, old, single male is a robot: a walking, talking, subservient robot.  Now, Stallone realized in writing this movie having a robot replace a hardworking maid would not be a prudent thing to do after writing in the movie.  Clearly, the only appropriate solution to this is to create romantic tension between Paulie and the robot.  Furthermore, when Rocky, Paulie, and later Adrian go to Siberia to train, the most reasonable option for babysitter is the robot.  Quite clearly, the robot was inspired greatly by Rosie of the Jetsons and added the character development that would have been lacking in this movie otherwise.<br/><br/>As mentioned, this movie was the third of the institution to be directed by Stallone himself.  In writing this movie, he could only come up with 35 minutes of dialog.  Add on the typical 20 minutes of boxing, and you have a 55 minute movie.  Now, this movie runs 91 minutes.  Take out about 2 minutes for credits, and you are left with 33 minutes to fill.  Thus, the best action to take was to exploit possibly the most distinctive tradition of the Rocky series: the montage.  This one, however, threw away the instrumentals because it was the 1980s, and the kids didnâ?Tt want instrumentals.  The kids wanted really bad rock and roll.  So Stallone got on the phone with his good buddies Survivo, which wrote the famous song, Eye of the Tiger, and asked them and some of their equally untalented buddies to write approximately 33 minutes worth of bad music.  The music was produced, and we were given numerous montages.  The first notable montages are the overblown entrance of Apollo Creed prior to facing Drago.  James Brown gives a pre-jail yet fully past-prime performance to a brilliantly theatrical descent from above by Creed.  His following death is very rich in religious symbolism, as he is put to death by an evil force for the sins of the United States.  The second montage of note is Stallone driving after Creedâ?Ts death, reminiscing on the past.  This montage is basically face-shots of Stallone in his Lamborghini and rehashed footage from the series up to this point.  The final notable montage is the training montage, which easily takes up much of the unaccounted for 23 minutes or so of the film.  The montage was a strong clich of films of the eighties, and this training sequence provided the standard by which all montages are judged to this day. The beauty and excess of Rocky training in the rugged environment Soviet Union in contrast with Drago training in a very 1980s computer enriched, yet completely fictitious and nonsensical, environment is clearly one of the most memorable twenty-plus minutes of film today.<br/><br/>It is practically a crime to not have seen this movie, because it stood for everything the people of a confused and thoughtless people of the decade believed in:  Robots will rule the world, Communism will always be a threat, and that by setting their standards low enough, they could never be disappointed.  Its a piece of history.  It should be shown to children in school."
"joseph t","Null","0","1","13 October 2003"," Surprisingly good sequel...
","Sequels often fail to live up to the quality of the original, but here we have a sequel to a sequel of a sequel.  But it holds up surprisingly well, thanks to the fundamental strength of the ""Rocky"" storyline: the underdog against the giant, the triumph of will and determination against machinelike brute strength.<br/><br/>Here we have the added twist of an East vs. West subplot.  But screenwriter-director-star Stallone is able to turn this to his advantage in terms of plot and character development.  Initially we see Rocky focusing strictly on revenge for his fallen colleague and friend Apollo Creed, but comes to have a deeper understanding of the bonds that can form between people and peoples.  Likewise, his opponent, Ivan Drago, is initially depicted as the stereotypical, one-dimensional cog-in-the-machine Soviet apparatchik, but who achieves a measure of personal redemption and fulfillment at the conclusion.  Of course, Rocky has ""made it"" and could just as well retire with the title and enjoy life, but at heart he is still the up-from-the-streets fighter and will do his best to achieve the task at hand in spite of the usual objections from Adrian as well as the long odds he faces.<br/><br/>The cast is its usual fine collection of familiar players.  Stallone of course is the featured actor, aided well by his usual cast of family and friends, Talia Shire as the loving and loyal Adrian, Burt Young as the somewhat brutish but loyal brother-in-law Paulie, and underrated Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed, all do good work in their respective roles. Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren does a good turn as Soviet boxer Drago, even though his dialog is severely limited, maybe a dozen lines or so (in English), and his hulking build (6'6"") is a stark contrast to the smaller but compactly-powerful Stallone.<br/><br/>The climactic fight scenes are always the hallmark and high point of the ""Rocky"" films, and this one does not disappoint on that score.  But there is an equally good high point just before the inception of the finale, and that is the brilliantly intercut sequence of the contrasting training styles of Rocky and Drago.  We see shot after shot of the low-tech Rocky lifting stones and climbing snowy hillsides, contrasted with the high-tech, mechanized Soviet system of digital readouts and computerized treadmills, all backed by the thumping, pounding, powerful soundtrack and vocal by John Cafferty.<br/><br/>So, compared with the other Rocky films, I'd have to place this on a par with Rocky II for well-crafted story and execution.  Give it a look especially if you're a Rocky fan, or just looking for an inspiring story of grit and determination and triumph in the face of long odds."

Drago hasn't said a single word yet, but the white-collar american crowd in the first fight boos him loudly because he's Russian, and we're expected to agree with them because by doing close-ups on his cold-looking face, the director set him up as the Bad Guy (tm). Ha! I've seen better audience manipulation in the WWF. As a result, the first half of the movie has the normal audience (ie, non-americans who view this movie without national bias, without automatically hating the Russians or cheering the Americans) supporting the Russian, and this becomes problematic since at the end of the first half he officially becomes the Bad Guy that you have to hate.<br/><br/>Lousy movie full of the american hollywood pseudo-patriotism that every real person hates, but it's still a guilty pleasure like all the other Rocky's because of the fight scenes."

The training scenes (best in series), they put in some humor with Drago as the new challenger  and the music is great ""livin in America, Eye of the tiger, its a man against man , burning heart "" Also good acting by Stallone as usual.<br/><br/>An underestimated movie that is enjoyable and fun to watch when Rocky faces his worst opponent ever.  . This is a good movie , and i recommend it . It goes the distance with the other Rocky movies<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","This film gets my blood pumping, with a new angle on it the Soviets vers the Americans.    Rocky, must go to the Soviet Union to fight the Soviet champ after his friend is killed.  Ivan Drago is portrayed as what the Soviet system can create, and Rocky a symbol of American grit has to defend the American way, and correct a personal mistake.  This film is directed so well that it gets my blood pumping, the fight scenes, and personal dialogue is incredible.  You leave this film on a high; Rocky, Rocky 3 and 4 know how to entertain, and I would not miss them for the world."

","Sometimes I just wonder.The original rocky was a masterpiece and Stallone looked like he had a very good chance of a great acting career.First blood was also quite good so... what happened to the sequels to those movies??Rambo II released on the same year was bad but this is awful.Rocky II was average,III hillarious and this ...oh my god!!I think Rocky 4 is the worst Stallone movie ever!The only fun part is when Creed dies(What a drama!!).We also see the worst actress of all times(you know who she is)AND the worst actor of all times(Dolph...)together in a movie.I don't really care about the propaganda because it is so funny and so poorly presented it ads an amusing element.Rocky in this movie becomes officially Superman after beating that monstrous russian...from Sweden.The actors who play the russian officials are creepy in a bad way.Believe me plan 9 from outer space is a better movie than this.Poor Stallone...."

","""Rocky IV"" is easily the most ridiculous entry in the long-running series, but is actually better than parts II and V.  This time Apollo (Weathers) wants to fight a quiet Russian (Dolph Lundgren).  When he gets his wish, he is brutally beaten to death (literally) in the ring.  Now Rocky (Stallone) is on a personal vendetta to defeat the Russian to avenge Apollo's death. Of course he does and all is right with the world.  Stallone's over-indulging direction and script kill any chance of this film being a success.  Stallone's lack of material turns this into another film which plays more like a music video than a motion picture.  Overall unexceptional to say the least.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

","One shouldn't take films like Rocky IV seriously... It's all about 'bashing' and cheap melodrama.<br/><br/>It's a bloody shame the Rocky series end up like this. The first film, Rocky (1976), had at least a new concept.<br/><br/>From that moment on it's only a rehash..."

","0 [zero stars] <br/><br/>Rocky IV<br/><br/>Directed by : Sylvester Stallone, 1985 <br/><br/>Cartoonish, Cold War inflicted bunch of garbage. <br/><br/>How did Stallone ever take Rocky this far out? <br/><br/>It is all here, from a new, pumped up tacky James Brown hit to a life-size robot on wheels; total mass-pleasing and pumping stupidity.<br/><br/>And oh! the stereotyping. Geez.<br/><br/>Watch out for then-wife Brigitte Nielsen from Denmark as cold-blooded wife of the cold-blooded Russian super boxing beast Drago (Dolph Lundgren) Â– both of who stand two feet taller than Stallone. Ouch! Who ever thought Stallone would sucker-punch himself?"
"Jocke-7","Null","0","1","28 November 1998"," Most of the film was great but the end was terrible!
","The movie had a lot of great scenes, especially the boxing scenes, but it was one of the most unbelievable endings I have ever seen! There is no way a small, weak guy like Stallone would defeat a huge, strong and powerful MAN like Dolph Lundgren. I'm sorry Sly but it was just too much, even for fiction."
