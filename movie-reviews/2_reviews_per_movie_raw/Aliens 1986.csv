","Aliens (1986) is the best Epic Sci-Fi Classic Action Movie of all time and one of my personal favorite best action sci-fi flicks that I love to death. Just like I love The Terminator and T2, I love this movie to death. James Cameron's classic masterpiece. The now classic science fiction film was only the third feature directed by James Cameron (following Piranha Part Two, The Terminator). It is the sequel to the 1979 film Alien and Alien is a masterpiece I love that film, but I love this movie more sorry this is my personal opinion this is my movie. I am not saying it is better than the original movie but it is right up there with Alien a real classic. <br/><br/> Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor from the original ""Alien"", returns to Earth after drifting trough space in hyper sleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-tech marines back to LV-426 and this time it's war! It has great cast I love the marines fighting aliens in this movie. The movie stars: Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, William Hope, Jenette Goldstein, Al Matthews, Mark Rolston , Ricco Ross, Colette Hiller, Daniel Kash ,Cynthia Dale Scott and Tip Tipping and they are all believable enough.<br/><br/>I love the characters beside Ellen Ripley, Newt, Corporal Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe I love those platoon of US Colonial Marines I know I haven't mentioned Burke because he was the bad guy and I don't like him. But most of the characters in this movie I love. <br/><br/> I know it is a sci-fi action film but it also does a have a horror mixed together people just don't see that. There's plenty of horror in it. The nightmare sequence in the beginning, the creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay. You see mother of those aliens who cocooned all the humans and killed them you see Ripley finding the nest and fight the Alien queen on the end. Ripley faces her fear and gets over her PTSD by going in by herself to rescue the Girl/Fight the Aliens/and Destroy the Entire Nest...Battles One on One with an Alien Queen and Whips its' Ass...and, by the end, now both her and Newt can dream without the worry of any more Nightmares (which plagued Ripley at the beginning of the film).<br/><br/>This is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it's not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1986!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores from James Horner of stuntmen used.<br/><br/>10/10 I have the Blu-ray disc which it also have a special edition version on it I used to had this film on DVD but I throw it away because I bought the Blu-ray which I am very happy about it. I love this film to death it is my personal favorite sci-fi action film even Lance Henriksen from Hard Target and The Terminator is in here and he is the good guy."
"Derek237","10","228","265","31 August 2005"," One of the most thrilling films ever- special edition highly recommended
","James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action, but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement, as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I should specify: Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.<br/><br/>In 1986 several scenes were cut to keep the movie's run-time reasonable but there was one scene that was incredibly foolish to leave out. The scene I refer to is near the beginning where Ripley learns that her daughter has died while she was away in 'hypersleep' for 57 years. ""I promised her I'd be home for her 11th birthday,"" cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character's depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She's seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn't elude to any of this, and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt- just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories, and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended (if not definitive) version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.<br/><br/>Aliens is a unique film experience: it's genuinely thrilling and exciting, unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there's disgusting blood and rapid gunfire, and it's really meaningless. In Aliens' case, the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don't see any aliens for over an hour, but once we do, it's a huge payoff. By that time, we get to know some interesting characters: Hicks (Michael Beihn), a take-charge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere, Hudson (Bill Paxton), a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time, Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein), the iron-willed woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film, Bishop (Lance Henrikson), a robot that is very helpful for everyone's survival, Burke (Paul Rieser), the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate, and of course, the adorable little Newt (Carrie Henn), a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver in her surprise-Oscar-nominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film, James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters, we're really concerned for their well-being. We don't want those aliens to get them. Some die, and I'm always truly bummed out when it happens.<br/><br/>Filled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills, Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts: whether it's action, sci-fi, horror, or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film, but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"
"ruth.boaz","Null","356","422","23 February 2000"," Outstanding blend of sci-fi, action, and humour.
","I rate Aliens a perfect 10.  This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!"
"carflo","10","372","446","8 December 2004"," Gets better every time I see it
","I am just going to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this movie. It is as near to being perfect as any I have ever seen. I will not say that it is much better than Alien - which is just about near to being perfect also. But I do love all the characters in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters were so well developed. Even most serious dramas seldom develops each character so completely. None of these characters are stereotypes even Paul Reiser as Burke, although the slimy company/government man villain is a prerequisite in disaster type movies. I would almost say that my favorite is Michael Beihn as Hicks, just because I like his work & consider him to be underrated. But I also like Lance Henriksen as Bishop, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Bill Paxton as Hudson, and of course, Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez. I liked all of these characters. I cared about their lives & deaths. The final scene for Gorman & Vasquez still chokes me up after seeing it many times. <br/><br/>I am not ignoring Sigourney Weaver or Carrie Henn. Ripley is the template for the modern action heroine. In the 24 years since Alien, few have been able to measure up to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Even in Alien 3 & 4, Ripley was still powerful, despite the 3ed rate quality of the movies. As for Carrie Henn as Newt, she was the emotional heart of Aliens. Cameron's ability to develop well rounded characters does not detract from his ability to create great action scenes or to scare the audience out of a several years of growth."
"Pluto-3","10","604","736","14 August 1998"," This ain't a film.
","THE sci-fi movie. It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD..."
"BrandtSponseller","10","286","345","7 February 2005"," Excellent sequel--matches the brilliance of the first film
","Series note: It is strongly advised that you watch this film only after seeing Alien (1979). This is a direct continuation of that story.<br/><br/>57 years after the events of the first film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found and awakened from hyper sleep to discover that a terraforming colony has been set up on LV-426, the planet wherein she and her fellow crew of the mining cargo spaceship Nostromo first encountered the titular aliens. When Earth-based communications loses contact with LV-426, a band of marines are sent to investigate, taking Ripley and a representative from the company that financed the colony, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) along for the ride.<br/><br/>For the difficult job of following up Ridley Scott's excellent Alien, director James Cameron decided to go a completely different route--to make a fast moving, slightly tongue-in-cheek, boisterous action extravaganza. Remarkably, he was able to do that while still maintaining a stylistic and literary continuity that melds Aliens seamlessly with the first film.<br/><br/>Ripley is much more fully developed in this film, although unfortunately, some of the most significant scenes were deleted from the theatrical release (if at all possible, watch the 2-hour and 37-minute director's cut instead). Cameron fashioned Aliens into a grand arc where Ripley's actions at the end of the film have much more meaning as she's not only fighting monsters, but also fighting to retain a semblance of something she lost due to her 57-year hyper sleep. As in the first film, she is still the most intelligent, courageous and resourceful member of the crew, but she has much more colorful company.<br/><br/>The marines accompanying Ripley back to LV-426 may be too cartoonish for some tastes (as for viewers of that opinion, most of the action and the film overall is likely to be too cartoonish), but for anyone more agreeable to that kind of caricatured exaggeration, it's a joy to watch. I'm a big fan of both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, and both turn in wonderfully over-the-top performances, at their diametrically opposed ends of the emotional spectrum--Paxton as the spastic surfer/redneck and Henriksen as the intense, moody sage, with a surprising reality and an even more surprising conscience to go along with it. We also get a cigar-chomping Sergeant, a crazy, butch Private, and a complex, pensive Corporal as main characters, and a mysterious, bright young girl (played in a terrific performance by Carrie Henn). Much of the center section of the film hinges on the interrelationships of these characters, despite the action trappings going on around them.<br/><br/>Cameron carries over the crypt/labyrinth motif of the first film, and adds a metaphorical descent into the bowels of hell in the climax. The action throughout is suspenseful. Aliens contains one of my favorite ""cat fights"" in any film. It's also worth noting the influence this film may have had on Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997)--although admittedly, we could say that Cameron was influenced a bit by the Robert A. Heinlein book, as well. Throughout all of the varied action sequences, as well as the important early scenes of colonists on LV-426, Cameron is able to clearly convey the logistics of very complex sets, so that viewers remain on the edges of their seats.<br/><br/>Part of what makes the monsters so effective is that we're not told too much about them. We only get glimpses into their physiology's, their behavioral patterns and their intelligence. Cameron gives us just enough to become wrapped up in the film, but not so much that we become overly familiar with the aliens, or start to question the logic behind the film. He also smartly carries over some devices from the first film that were abandoned to an extent, such as the acidic blood of the aliens, and he supplies answers to the few questions that the first film raised, such as why the blood doesn't corrode instruments and objects when a dead alien is examined.<br/><br/>Aliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series. Just make sure you watch both in order, and try to watch the director's cuts."

","Aliens is as good as its predecessor but not quite the same as its more action and less horror. Director James Cameron does an eminent job as well as making Aliens an exhilarating, quotable and ultimately unforgettable.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep and finds out that the moon she previously visited is colonised but by whom...
The eeriness and fear are replaced with intense action and larger than life marines. Replaced for good? Yes and no, What made Alien great is its eerie music tone and sound design with the alien being more feared. However what makes Aliens great is the exact opposite, more aliens result in more action and more intensity as if its a new lease on life.<br/><br/>We're introduced into a brand new Ripley, she's a survivor now and Sigourney Weaver does a nearly flawless job utilising her character.
The technicalities are kept and the sound design is overhauled in an impressive way.<br/><br/>Like all movies, Aliens isn't flawless and it does have one slightly major plot hole: Hicks knew the aliens were going to breach their perimeter sooner or later yet no one suggested going to the other dropship until they learned about the nuclear disaster. Meaning they were going to sit in that same room for seventeen days with barely any ammo and 100+ aliens breaking in only if the reactors didn't go critical.<br/><br/>Aliens knows what it wants to be and makes a genre-defying attempt doing it.<br/><br/>Final Rating: 9/10"
"baumer","10","226","290","15 June 1999"," James Cameron and Bill Paxton at their finest
","There are really good movies and then there's that select few that change your life.  For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that.  By viewing a movie you see life in a different light.  Aliens also did that to me.  I didn't think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more.  The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.<br/><br/>Paul Reiser is perfect as Burke,the slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives.  Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop, the cyborg with a heart.  Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn ( another Cameron favourite )is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice.  But the show stopper in this flick ( just as he always is in any movie that he is in ) is Bill Paxton.<br/><br/>Paxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1, True Lies, Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic.  Here, his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with.  His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior.  He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can't hide his fear.  When he finds out that they won't be rescued for at least seventeen days, his response is "" Hey man, we're not going to survive 17 hours man!  Those things are going to come in here and they're going to get us and..... "" ( Ripley ) This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training. "" ( Hudson ) "" Why don't ya put her in charge!!! ""<br/><br/>Paxton is a gift to any and every movie that he is in and this is his finest work.  He should have won a best supporting actor that year.  And if you haven't seen this movie, rush to see it if only for Bill Paxton.  He steals the show.  But if a tightly wound, brilliantly technical and unbelievably scary movie is your thing, then you can't go wrong here.  This is easily a ten out of ten, and one of the best ever made.  If Spielberg is the king is Hollywood, then Cameron is his heir apparent.  Oh, and one more thing, Paxton will win an Oscar one day."
"Collins","9","170","218","6 December 1998"," ALIENS IS THE SCI-FI GENRE
","""Aliens"" is the best trapped-with-a-monster-right-behind-you movie of all time.  The weird part is that it's not the first of its kind.  Usually, the first of a genre is always the best but these kinds of movies were made decades-and-decades before 1986's ""Aliens.""  Still, through its strong story and characters, it elbows its way to the head of the class.<br/><br/>Ripley is a heroine like no other.  She thrills you.  Her powerful presence and unstoppable soul will always live on in the minds of movie-goers.  She and Newt form a surrogate mother-daughter relationship that is more touching than anything I've seen before in this kind of a movie.  In this movie more than any other in the ""Alien"" series, Ripley's a woman who does what she can (and then some) to protect herself and the ones around her.  She's the perfect action hero.<br/><br/>On top of that, the pulsing music that plays while Bishop is speeding them away from the exploding compound and while Ripley is booting  the Queen Alien out into space is beyond comparison.<br/><br/>Note:  If you LOVED this movie, it's probably best you don't see Alien 3. It, for some reason, turns the triumph of this film's conclusion into a depression deeper than the vastness of a hundred black holes."

","ALIENS really does have it all.  Perfect direction.  Beautiful cinematography.  Intense characters.  Big guns.  Action.  Heroism. Courage.  Battles.  Friendship.  Bravery.  It is certainly the BEST sequel ever made in movie history, and one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.<br/><br/>At its core is Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by the badass Sigourney Weaver), a warrant officer, and tough as nails.  Her character is one of the greatest heroines of all time.  Sigourney really does pull it off.  No one else could have done it like her.  Ripley's maternal connection with the young girl Newt is amazing to watch...but the ultimate scene is her final battle with the galaxy's most deadly creature - set to a pulsing military score (James Horner delivers in a big way!).  Quite possibly my favorite fight scene of all time.<br/><br/>There's not really much else to say - just go watch the movie on DVD, and you will not be let down.  You're in for a wild ride!!!<br/><br/>ALIENS:  THIS TIME, IT'S WAR"
"jimfly_2003","9","167","222","29 January 2003"," Aliens..My all time favourite Sci-Fi movies. It rocks!
","I have watched this movie when I was a pre-teen at the cinema, and MY! It completely blew me away. It has got my adrenalin pumping so hard that I almost wanted to slip back to my seat and take a breather! Although during that time I didn't quite understand most parts of it (too young to understand), I was deeply immersed into such rich story-telling and the fantastic alien creatures. The tensely build-up atmosphere and the space-ships, grips you so tightly it seems never to let go.<br/><br/>This movie rocks, scares you right on to your face, very mysterious, have tons of special effects (not quite CGI though, but the mechanical aliens looks just so threatening and scary). James Cameron is such a fabulous story-teller in this Sci-Fi stellar! The movie ran at more than 2 hours but I didn't feel that at all. Actually James has cut out a lot of scenes for this theatrical release back then, but you can still get those scenes back on the DVD (extra 17 minutes footage).<br/><br/>The acting is good especially from Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen (as the robot). Sigourney's Ripley is such a strong-willed woman, that even put shame to men (somehow I feel this is quite unbelievable, because she has got so much energy, especially the scene where she gets back to the Queen's hatch to save Newt). I have watched other alien series (Alien legacy - All four parts), but I can say this part 2 of the series is my favourite, followed by Alien, then Alien:Resurrection, and lastly Alien3)<br/><br/>I am quite happy to see this film stays high at one of the top Sci-Fi movies in IMDB)<br/><br/>Till now as an adult, I still go back to watch this DVD occasionally and every time I watch it again, it brings in a completely new scare, and new thoughts, also the new meaning of what is a horror movie all about!<br/><br/>Highly recommended if you haven't watched this yet. I give it an 8 out of 10! (Truly deserves the high IMDB rating at 8.2 to-date)"
"WoBiE1","10","49","61","7 June 1999"," A milestone in movie making....
","Just recently, I have purchased the new Alien Legacy box set on DVD, and each one is excellent. Aliens is the second chapter in the Alien saga and is probably the most remembered by today's generation. Let's face it; it changed the way sci-fi movies were made forever,and it hasn't been for the best(I'm not saying Aliens is a bad film). Aliens set such a high standard in action sci-fi(basically the new genre the James Cameron has created) that none of the copycats can compete. Take the recent movies Soldier and Event Horizon(both directed by Paul Anderson). They both try to be Alien movies but do not succeed. My advice to Mr. Anderson is to stop trying to copy what has already been done. Enough said.<br/><br/>As for Aliens, it is a perfect sci-fi action movie. Great casting(although ALL are stereotypes), great music(James Horner is the man), great use of technology and  a well written script are all present. Weaver's performance is outstanding; one of the best action heroes of all time just happens to be a woman. If you have a chance to watch the director' cut of Aliens, I suggest you take it(it's available in the new Alien Legacy box set or alone on DVD and VHS as well as on laserdisc). It expands on Ripley's maternal persona which makes Weaver's performance all the better.<br/><br/>James Cameron came off making The Terminator and made Aliens. He used his expertise in the sci-fi genre and created an engrossing story that does not let up until the final reel of the film. For all the young folk out there that have not seen this film, watch it and see perfection in action movie making. A must see."

The characters are distinct, memorable and believable. The plot builds slowly into the most tense, suspenseful roller-coaster ride I've ever experienced in the cinema. The special effects are good even by today's standards, and the sets are simply second to none. This is one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>If you like this kind of movie and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Twenty years on and the only other Sci Fi action movie in the same league is James Cameron's Terminator 2. I can only hope he returns to this genre in the future, he is the master.<br/><br/>Oh, and try to see the special extended edition if possible, the extra scenes make an amazing movie even better."
"dorotka24","10","31","41","14 January 2008"," Best of Sci-Fi Action
","Aliens is one of many movies from my adolescent years that is just as good today as it was back then. It is an adrenaline filled ride filled with creepy locations, intense action, thrills, much circumstantial humor and one-liners that will never grow old (mostly thanks to Bill Paxton). It is, unapologetically, a man's movie, filled with everything except nudity (which it did not need).<br/><br/>All movies in the Alien series have a claustrophobic feel to them, and involve a relatively small cast of players. Aliens is no exception and really capitalizes on the fear potential of the locale. Cameron is not exactly known for injecting horror into his films, but provides enough here to satisfy.<br/><br/>The characters are very well cast and the actors have great chemistry. I especially grooved to the fact that, even though the soldiers are supposed to be tough marines, not all of them were completely gung-ho about their adventures. In fact, a few were downright cowardly and indecisive in the face of combat - something I'm certain would happen to many in such a situation. Bill Paxton stole the show as the wisecracking space marine. With all the likable characters involved, the stakes were very high. When they start dropping, we feel the loss.<br/><br/>Movies like this just don't come around very often. The pacing is very tight, even when the action is absent. The characters and situations are interesting enough - when the action hits, it just serves to suck us in deeper. I have nothing bad to say about Aliens. It is simply an awesome movie with a well deserved reputation for being such. See for yourself."
"MaxBorg89","10","38","52","15 May 2007"," Hands down one of the best sequels ever!
","Back in 1986, sequels had become very common (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones), yet people were suspicious when they heard of a follow-up to Alien, Ridley Scott's acclaimed sci-fi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie, which had been entrusted to an unknown (at the time) named James Cameron. Fortunately, Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator, and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens, which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.<br/><br/>Given how the first film ended (all characters but one died), Cameron wisely decided to radically separate his movie from the original, and he does so from the very beginning by having Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) wake up from her cryogenic sleep and make a shocking discovery: although she hasn't aged at all, 57 years have passed since she left the Nostromo, meaning everyone she knew is either dead or very old (in a particularly heartbreaking scene, she talks on the phone with her grown-up daughter, who is full of resentment for her ""unjustified"" absence). In addition, no one believes her story regarding the alien since, as she's told by scientist Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), the planet where these creatures allegedly lived has been successfully colonized. Suddenly, though, all communications with LV-426 are inexplicably interrupted. Thinking there might be some truth to Ripley's tale, Burke asks her to join him and a group of soldiers on a mission to uncover the mystery. And while most of the participants are in it just for the money, our heroine realizes this is her only chance of confronting her worst nightmare and overcoming it for good.<br/><br/>The main problem with Alien, some have said, was that, as great as it can be, the characterizations were reduced to the minimum (not that it really mattered, with Ridley Scott ensuring the film retained the right pace and suspense throughout). With Aliens, character development is the last thing fans should worry about, Cameron being fully aware of each individual's potential and exploiting it as much as he can. Ripley, who was just part of an ensemble in the original, is now allowed to carry the whole film, and boy, does she carry it: rarely has there been a more solid, compelling female role in a genre movie like this (the fact that Sigourney Weaver is the only actress, thus far, to have received an Oscar nomination for a science-fiction film is further testament to Aliens' immortality). The supporting cast is equally good, with a multitude of different characters ranging from funny (regular Cameron collaborators Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) to weird (Lance Henriksen's android Bishop) and bringing something extra to the movie's unique atmosphere.<br/><br/>Ah, the film's mood: that's the other aspect Cameron deserves all the credit in the world for. On a superficial level, it could be said Alien was a horror movie, while the follow-up is more action-oriented; that may be true, but one should also notice that every single spectacular battle scene actually oozes tension, never leaving the audience with a pause to breathe or relax. In fact, Cameron has succeeded where many other directors would have failed: he stayed faithful to the original's tone, but managed nonetheless to make the film undeniably his own.<br/><br/>Relentlessly creepy, occasionally very violent and consistently compelling, Aliens is a pitch-perfect piece of adult science-fiction. Watch it on a double bill with Scott's version and you will get four hours of genre film-making at its finest."

You can't see them, but you can hear them, ker-k-link, each in succession, right around your sound stage. The noise tells you that they haven't just latched, but latched and locked. Listen with you eyes shut, if you don't believe me. It's that meticulous attention to detail both aural and visual that makes this movie a true work of art. There really is no need for the sounds to be there at all. But they are, and they convey complete fidelity to a scene that lasts just seconds. <br/><br/>Here's another. When the marines are crossing the rain-swept depot to the airlock, its windy and wild. When they get inside, the ambiance completely changes. it's still noisy, the wind continues, faint but audible and there is lots of dripping water, but now there's also a strange, claustrophobic intimacy, and I'm quite at a loss as to how that has been accomplished. Yet the mood-change is hair-raisingly palpable. <br/><br/>These set pieces are completely seamless throughout the movie. Strange, gloomy, suggestive, broken; the ghost of dead technology appears to haunt them as much as any alien demons. A thin, whining, electronic note does the work of tense music, it suits the circumstances perfectly, as well as providing a foil to any ambient sounds that the engineers and director thought appropriate.   <br/><br/>The sound and sets earned it two well-deserved Oscars.<br/><br/>Tension builds and builds again. It's a fairly well-worn formula of gradual attrition. Ripley's valliant rescue of the ambushed and trapped space-marines must have any viewer at the edge of their seat. And on it goes, tighter and tighter, until finally we are squeezing through air-ducts. <br/><br/>Acting is pretty formulaic but entirely believable. People we've quickly grown to like get killed suddenly and nastily, smug Apone, and macho Drake. The alien queen brings the movie to a perfect climax. Correct me if I'm wrong, but there was absolutely no CGI in this. Proof enough that it isn't actually needed, and is never as good as the real McCoy. <br/><br/>And the script, by the way, is excellent.<br/><br/>As a comment upon sexuality and survival it is a very telling one. The female is deadlier than the male. It draws from a simple Darwinian premise, that she makes a greater investment in the production of the young, and will therefore go to more determined and ruthless lengths to ensure their survival. She knows her genes are in the offspring: momma's baby, poppa's maybe. Males are simply expendable seed-carriers of convenience. <br/><br/>I've docked a point for what strikes me as technological incongruity. The continued use of old-fashioned 'querty' keyboards for example, and CRT/VDU. The latter have all but gone to the scrap-heap now, never mind hundreds of years hence. Check-out the roll-up screens in 'Red Planet'; now that's more like it. Also, a sophisticated android like 'Bishop' surely suggests the probability of 'mechanised' marines. Or at least, a self-propelled remote for entering the alien hive. Bomb disposal squads already have those today. Bishop himself should have been able to simply plug-in and interface with the uplink. Or even communicate by WiFi. Though these things would compromise drama, their absence compromises its science-fiction credentials. And I am certainly no purist. <br/><br/>But, golly-gosh! - nit-picking aside; this is an absolute crackerjack of entertainment.<br/><br/>I believe it has only one other challenger for the crown of greatest sci-fi horror movie - Carpenter's 'The Thing'. <br/><br/>You split 'em; I can't. <br/><br/>It's 22 and 26 years since their creation, and no-one has managed to raise the bar. What does that tell you?"

","I have been long a fan of the orignal ""Alien"", but somehow I never saw this sequel until now. If this were in fact the first or only ""alien"" movie, I would undoubtedly rate it higher than I do. It's edge of your set, exciting, and much better than most movies of this type. The special effects are great, and there are some real scary moments.<br/><br/>But to say this is ""as good"" or ""beter"" than the original--that I cannot agree with.<br/><br/>First of all, there is very litte original in this sequel. Indeed, it is more of a remake of the first Alien than a progression. The plot if very similar, and indeed, the ending is basically the same idea, right down to Sigourney Weaver in her underwear. So the mere fact that is not original is to be considered. What Aliens offers over Alien, is faster pacing, more and bigger aliens, and a generally higher adrenaline level. This is probably why a lot of people prefer it. And it is all very well done.<br/><br/>But Aliens is basically a military shoot-em-up. The original, for all its comparative simplicity, is a much more subtle, deftly constructed, and very atmpospheric movie.  The spareness creates a feeling of claustrophobia and terror which is very effective and memorable.  I found Alien truly psychologically frightening, while Aliens is more of an in your face adrenaline rush.  Alien also has a more interesting cast, more human and subtle. The military posturing of the Aliens cast was pretty standard stuff. Sigourney Weaver, of course, is possibly even better than in the first movie. I also like the music in the first movie better.<br/><br/>
I find Leonard Maltin's comment on the Alien inexplicable. What he seems not to like about the first movie is there in spades in the second movie.<br/><br/>Aliens is a darn good movie, but Alien is a sci-fi classic."

","Having been a fan of the Alien films for many years, I have recently been finding myself drawing comparisons between the first two films in the series, and not liking what I was thinking. I like both films a great deal, but find Alien a superior film in my books.<br/><br/>The overall plot of Alien is about a small group of people in isolated conditions. A dangerous alien gets loose amongst them. Everyone bar one person and a cat is killed. The lead goes back to rescue the cat. The survivors manage to barely escape at the last moment from a large mining ship going thermonuclear. Unbeknownst to the survivors, the alien sneaks on board, and after a brief struggle, it is blown out of an airlock into space, courtesy of Ripley. The survivors go into hypersleep, and the credits roll.<br/><br/>Aliens is about a larger group of people in isolated conditions. Many dangerous aliens gets loose amongst them. Everyone bar three plus an andriod are killed. The lead goes back to rescue a child. The survivors manage to barely escape at the last moment from a large mining colony going thermonuclear. Unbeknownst to the survivors, the big alien sneaks on board, and after a struggle, it is blown out of an airlock into space, courtesy of Ripley. The survivors go into hypersleep, and the credits roll.<br/><br/>More than just a few similarities here. The second one is basically a rehash of the first, on a larger scale (more people, more aliens, more noise, more explosions). The basic plot is not only the same, there are specific point of plot detail that are the same.<br/><br/>I also find the story for Alien a lot more edgy, a true psychological horror / drama, where the alien was secondary in the story to the interaction between the crew of the Nostromo. Aliens is more of an action / horror film. This is of course a personal preference. However, I am finding myself getting increasingly annoyed with modern movies concentrating on loud noise, fast action, and great effects, while neglecting the story. And from what I can see, Cameron took the original story, and added loud noise and fast action. I feel the effects on the first were actually superior. Bigger is not necessarily better.<br/><br/>Set / decoration / costume wise, both movies have aged very well. I do however get a little annoyed in Aliens when I continually see the video screens in the movie being standard 4:3 tv's, actually blackened down to 1.85:1 to make them look like a futuristic widescreen sets I guess. Pretty ironic, when I think about it, given how Cameron makes films (matted 1.66:1 Super 35). If he made Aliens now, he'd probably matt the tubes down to 2.35:1...<br/><br/>And on a light-hearted note, I like cats. Anyone who'd risk their life to save their cat is true hero in my books. Add to this the fact that I don't like children, and Alien definitely gets my vote in this area too..."
"factualnatural","10","18","26","1 July 2006"," Unbelievable action
","In space no one can hear you scream. Officially, Aliens should be called an action movie, not a horror like the first, because it is not stop and the special effects are top of the line. Acid for blood, and humans for hosts, the aliens of the film are THE image for aliens you will think of from now on. I've seen this movie countless times, and have never picked out a real flaw. It has so many great characters.. Hudson, Bishop, newt, Hicks, all the marines, and ofcoarse Ripley and the aliens themselves. I loved Bishop as the android, and Hudson's panic and foul mouthed presence earned him a lot of fans. The story is a colony establishing an atmosphere on a planet loose communication with 'the company' running the show. USMC marines are sent in to see what's going on and Ripley the survivor of the 1st film reluctantly agrees to go along. The director even lets you get to know each marines personality, each one is a little unique and I thought the cast was really a timeless one. There's some amazing combination of puppets, animatronics, and miniatures used in the film from the drop ships to the amazing face huggers to the new queen alien from. There's enough beeps on motion trackers, futuristic weapons, and ice cold metal cooridors to fill 3 movies. Not to mention this time 'it's war' with literally crowds of aliens coming at us full speed. The most memorable moments are of the crew preparing for the mission at the meal table and bishop the android doing the knife trick at 100 miles an hour between the fingers of a marine who laid his hand on the table (Hudson). But the mega scene is when Ripley has to find the young character (only survivor colonist) named newt, which leads her directly into the alien breeding chamber. The alien queen is simply amazingly done, and the director Jim Cameran really convinced the effects guys to go all the way with it. Well it worked. The result was amazing and pricless. What really made Aliens an absolute action and horror gem was the writing and the amount that was there was just so richly done I was so very impressed. It's by far the best of the series of movies and the best alien film of all time."
"Reiko_95","10","24","37","2 February 2008"," When you put your heart into doing something memorable, people will remember your name
","You know back in 1987 when i first watched this movie on VHS - later i watched the uncut version - i was at first reluctant at giving it a shot but then i said what the hell might as well go for it and let me tell you i was more than impressed i was awed this movie was THAT good. I thought of it as the best sci-fi flick ever at the time and still do 20 years later. I mean you gotta look at this movie not only from the crew's perspective but also from the audience's. And that perspective scores very high all across the board mainly because from the very beginning the crew was set on making a sci-fi futuristic movie that continued the story from ""ALIEN"" but added new unique elements to the story. Everything is great about ""ALIENS"" the plot the storyline fine continuity and not only it follows where Riddley Scott left off but adds something unique to the gender. And the way the story unfolds gradually building up the tension while at the same time treading on that fine line between dark and light, good and evil, is just amazing how that was done in terms of sentimentality Ripley ,missed her daughter's birthday because fate was cruel to her given the circumstances of her floating out into space for 57 years, after she escaped from the Nostramo, and now she sees in Newt the one and only child who could possibly make up for the hole left in her soul once she found out her daughter was gone only 2 years prior to her rescue and here is her chance to make up for it. The way this chemistry between Newt and Ripley develops can clearly be seen throughout the movie little at first but as the movie advances, their relationship grows ever stronger and culminates at the end when Newt calls Ripley ""mommy"". It's clear that James Cameron and all his crew had their hearts set on making a movie not just for the money but also for providing high quality action to the viewer blended with that feeling that despite all the evil around us, despite all the risks we take all the compromises we might make, love conquers all in the end from start to finish while at the same time making us relate in some way to anyone of the characters..I mean you gotta understand that love, sentimentality and aliens, the story of the movie don't quite mix generally speaking, but by bringing Newt into the picture as the orphan child, the way the chemistry between the main character and the little kid develops, is just amazing..is something unique and you don't get to see this a lot in movies of this gender at least not a lot. I just watched not long ago ""ALIENS, THE MAKING OF - BONUS DVD ONLY and i was just amazed with all the hard work and soul James Cameron and his entire crew put in, in order to give the audience a final product that i'm sure will be remembered for generations to come. And to sum it up that's what this movie is all about...something that revolutionized the sci-fi gender. Of course Riddley Scott did a fine job to with ""ALIEN"" only James did better. Way to go James! A masterpiece! And one other thing...you gotta keep in mind they used 80's technology as far as the equipment used is concerned - the spaceship just to name one, the atmosphere processor, etc- but looking at this movie 20 years later you still cant tell the technology is outdated..is just amazing how they've accomplished something like this and only with an 18-million dollar budget at the time. This just goes to show that if you as a director and crew as well have your heart set on making something memorable, everyone will remember your name. And last but not least, the soundtrack rocked, man, especially given that James Horner had little time to implement it into the movie. Good work James! My vote 10/10"
"Paul Kydd","8","150","281","17 February 2001"," Compelling, far superior sequel to sci-fi classic (8/10)
","Seven years after barely surviving events on board the Nostromo in Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi horror ALIEN, Sigourney Weaver reprised her role as Warrant Officer Ripley for one of the most compelling and critically-acclaimed sequels of all time.  Canadian director James Cameron had already struck gold with the Arnold Schwarzenegger starring vehicle THE TERMINATOR (1984), after his somewhat inauspicious feature film directorial debut with the long-forgotten, Dutch-backed PIRANHA II: THE SPAWNING 3 years earlier.  ALIENS would further cement Cameron's growing reputation as a first-rate director of high-tech, fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action thrillers, from which there would normally be no let-up once they got going.<br/><br/>When Ripley is rescued from drifting aimlessly through deep space, she is horrified to learn that not only has she been asleep for 57 years, but the planet on which she had encountered the original alien all that time ago has since been colonized.  At first no-one will heed her warnings or completely believe the story she gives at an official enquiry as to what happened to her and her fellow Nostromo crew members.  But then contact is lost with LV-426, and despite initially throwing Ripley ""to the wolves"" (as she herself puts in), The Company, through representative Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser), suddenly finds itself in a position of having to ask Ripley for help, finally persuading her to return to the planet that still consumes her every nightmare, as an advisor to a motley group of very tough colonial marines expecting this to be just another run-of-the-mill ""bug-hunt"".  But how wrong that assumption turns out to be!<br/><br/>I would argue that ALIENS far surpasses its celebrated predecessor in almost every aspect.  Obviously the sheer spectacle of what is basically a Vietnam war movie in space is particularly awe-inspiring - the impressive sets, the many excitingly-staged combat sequences, the aliens themselves (interestingly enough, although through fast cutting and appropriate camera placement it seems as though there are hundreds of aliens being blasted to kingdom come - or else picking off the gung-ho marines one by one - in reality no more than 6 aliens are ever seen in any one shot).  But the human drama element of this sequel is also greatly heightened, primarily by the introduction of ""Newt"" (wonderful little Carrie Henn, in her only film role), who turns out to be the sole survivor of recent events on LV-426, becoming a kind-of surrogate daughter to Ripley, which leads to several touching moments and gives the story a surprisingly effective emotional core in the midst of all the otherwise pre-eminent carnage.<br/><br/>Amongst the talented supporting players are Cameron regulars Michael Biehn (THE TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS) and Bill Paxton (bit part in THE TERMINATOR, TRUE LIES, TITANIC), and Cameron's punchy dialogue includes such suitably macho wisecracks as - Hudson (Paxton): ""Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?""  Vasquez (a pumped-up Jenette Goldstein): ""No, have you?""  Nominated for 7 Oscars, including Weaver as Best Actress (again this confirms the general class on display, as it is fairly rare for the Academy to recognize the acting qualities inherent in this type of predominantly action-driven movie), the film went on to win for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects Editing.  Further, almost inevitable sequels followed in 1992 and 1997, but I prefer to think of the terrifying perils of Ellen Ripley as ending on this high note."
"LordBlacklist","10","15","22","8 February 2006"," The Exciting Continuation
","Review 2 of 4<br/><br/>As the middle part of the Alien trilogy this film accomplishes exactly what any good second chapter must do, it builds on the world established in the first film and takes the story in new and interesting places. The emotional canvas of this story is broader than the original Alien, and the film as a whole is less subtle. I really like the theme's of family and the parallel character arcs of Ripley and Newt. They are both characters who have lost everything they ever cared about and through finding each other they attempt to fill the holes in their hearts that their respective losses have left behind. Cameron takes great time in setting up his characters from the start, something that was lacking in the original. The beginning of the film may be a little slow but like Cameron's next film, The Abyss, the payoff in the end would not be nearly as satisfying without all this time to get to know the characters and become emotionally invested. The setup is massively important to the rest of the film. Aside from the abundance of action this film benefits greatly from a larger emphasis on character. Hudson, Hicks, Vasquez, Burke, and Bishop are all very memorable characters, perhaps more memorable than those in the original film. It is the relationships between these characters that make it more than just an action film. Cameron has such a way with dialog and Aliens is a prime example. I have built entire friendships on mutual love of this movie. So many lines are so easily quotable. From a technical level this film is flawless, and like the original it has not aged much at all since its release twenty years ago.<br/><br/>If in the first film Ripley was discovering her inner strength, Aliens is where she learns to master her fear. In this film we also learn the depths of her humanity that was scarcely present in the original film (the scene where she goes back to save her cat comes to mind.) Ripley is a character that continues to change and grow, and this film does a fine job of fleshing out her interesting (in under developed) character from the first film. Aliens is definitely a film to watch more than a few times, but for different reasons than the first. The mystery and ambiance of the original film makes it fascinating to watch multiple times, but Aliens is more like spending time with old friends, you want to spend two and a half hours with these characters. Aliens is quite possibly the perfect sequel because it gives you everything you got in the first film and much, much more."

","How do you follow up a movie that is possibly the best example of a sci-fi/horror movie ever? Simple. Make what is possibly the best sci-fi/action movie ever. Eminently quotable and totally enthralling, Aliens burst onto our screen seven years after the original movie was released. At the helm this time was the relatively unknown director James Cameron and didn't he do well? The plot is a simple one. After being cryogenically frozen for 57 years, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is found floating in space. She is woken up and finds out that the planet they first found the Alien on is now inhabited. Despite her impassioned pleas that her crew was killed by a massive alien that burst out of a man's chest, had acid for blood and two sets of teeth, for some reason she isn't believed. Her pilot status stripped away, she is left to fend for herself, until earth loses contact with the colonists. Then Ripley is talked into joining the Marines assigned to find out what went wrong in an advisory roll. The Marines are cocky, brash, over-confident and wielders of immense amounts of firepower. In short they're dead meat. Also along for the ride are Bishop (Lance Henriksen) - an android, and Burke (Paul Reiser) - a sleazy corporation guy. Upon entering the colonists' facility the Marines find signs of a massive firefight, as well as a remarkably cute little girl generally called Newt (Carrie Henn). Eventually they find where the colonists appear to be. All in one area so it's a simple matter of going down there and finding out what's going on.<br/><br/>After the majority of the marines have been killed and their main way off the planet wiped out it's up to the survivors to  basically - continue to survive. Eventually, after a few more casualties, they escape. Except ooops, Newt didn't make it. Happy to leave behind Marines and corporate stooges by the bucket-load, Ripley, who frankly hasn't been the best mother in the world to her own daughter, decides to go back for Newt. An encounter with the Alien Queen and a whole room full of eggs and her finding Newt later and we're back on the space ship, finally safe. Until, of course, in a fantastic fake-out involving more milk and yoghurt than ever before seen on film we see Bishop ripped to shreds by the Alien Queen we thought was left behind to die. The final showdown of these two protective mother figures is a lot of fun, the Queen is sucked out into space and everyone is happy in the end. OK, so maybe the plot isn't all that simple.<br/><br/>Many people may have heard me call this a Vietnam War movie and, once again, I stand by that. The Marines, despite their high-tech weaponry look like a unit in Vietnam. This was a conscious decision by Cameron, he went as far as getting the actors to decorate and customise their own costumes. The scenario itself (high-tech army against low-tech but numerically superior forces), vents doubling for tunnels, the heat, the loud Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) the oppressive atmosphere: all of it feels like Vietnam. You even have Hudson (Bill Paxton) talking about being a short timer! This allows the audience to connect with the characters. By making the distant future feel like our recent past (the war had only finished 11 years previously) we are able to identify with their plight. These aren't super soldiers or men in battle suits. These are grunts who are just doing their job.<br/><br/>The acting is generally pretty good, with the supporting cast not given that much to do other than portray a group of Marine stereotypes. Paxton is possibly the most standout of all of the marines, though he does generally get most of the best lines. Michael Biehn as the dependable Cpl. Hicks, Ripley's love interest, is also very good. Both Henriksen and Reiser give great performances, with memories still strong of Ian Holms android going postal in the first movie, Henriksen plays every moment for all of its sinister value until the very end when we realise Bishop is a good guy, and Reiser is so slimy he practically leaves a trail.<br/><br/>The best performance of the movie is easily that given by Weaver. The fact that in 1987 a performance in a sci-fi/action movie should be nominated for an Oscar is testament enough to the quality of her acting. The mother-daughter bond that grows between Ripley and Newt is central to the movie, and one that allows Weaver to develop her character even further. Of course Cameron cannot resist mirroring this with the maternal instincts of the Alien Queen. These themes of motherhood and the nature of the difference between the two species are continued in the next two movies, although never as subtly.<br/><br/>What can I say about the direction? It's James Cameron, so there is a lot of blue or red on the screen. Here it leads to a truly atmospheric feel, the tension building up as things just go from bad to worse for the marines. With clever use of camera angles, quick cuts, lighting and good old fashioned dry ice, Cameron never once gives away too much about the aliens, and manages to make it feel like there are far more on screen than there really are.<br/><br/>This is a movie that does not give you a break. Cameron is either piling on the dramatic tension or the adrenalin pumping action. Everything about this movie is sheer class and it is rightly considered one of the best of its type ever made. If you don't like this movie then the problem is your taste in films, not the film itself. If you have not seen it, not only am I surprised, I recommend you do so when you're in the mood to have a roller-coaster ride but Blackpool is too far away."

They had a brilliant cast, brilliant story, brilliant effects and brilliant acting.<br/><br/>The thing i was most impressed about was the design of it all. It looked amazing.

The king alien looked very good and the set of it's home was very good as well. Yet again Sigourney Weaver puts on a brilliant performance as like she did in the first one and Jennette Goldstien as Pvt Vaquez gave a great performance and is one of the best movie heroes ever.<br/><br/>With the first film it had a lot of parts that made you jump and had you on the edge of your seat. It was exactly the same with this one. There were lots of parts that made you jump and nearly the whole film had you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what was going to happened next and they had a lot more gore in this than the first which was good to see because i thought in the first it would be fairly gory but it weren't that much.<br/><br/>If you thought the first was good you must watch this.

","One of those rare sequels that is better than the first movie in every way.<br/><br/>James Cameron manages to take everything that was great about Ridley Scott's original 1979 film and builds on top of it to make a superior sequel.<br/><br/>It not only maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere of the first, but I found the characters more endearing and memorable (Ex. Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez) this time around.<br/><br/>The action is great, the creature designs are better, and the visuals are simply awesome. The Queen Alien is one of the greatest monsters ever put on screen and it's amazing that the effects were all done in camera.<br/><br/>Aliens also feels more textured from a character and writing perspective. I love the Vietnam War/Starship Trooper aesthetic (I personally like this movie better than the actual Starship Trooper movie) and the underlying themes of motherhood that is further accented in the extended cut.<br/><br/>I also liked how Ripley is upgraded to be an action heroine and Cameron showcases this transition perfectly. It all felt perfectly natural and in keeping with the logic of the story (I'M LOOKING AT YOU FORCE AWAKENS!!).<br/><br/>James Cameron back in his heyday really understood that in order for all this action and spectacle to matter, you need to have compelling relatable characters to anchor it.<br/><br/>It kinda bothers me that there is this growing trend of stereotyping the film as a ""dumber action shoot-em up"" version of Alien, which baffles me to no end.<br/><br/>Seriously, it's nearly a full hour before any gun is fired and there is literally zero moments in this story where the marines have the upper hand."

And this isn't just mindless action, the film expertly builds each character enough to make them more than just alien fodder. The action itself is of high quality, and the periods of quiet in between the action sequences expertly drum up the suspense. Easily the most intense movie I've ever seen."
"The_Movie_Cat","6","34","60","9 November 2000"," Better than the original?
","WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Aliens, the revisionist, formulaic sequel by James Cameron was the most successful in terms of audience appeal, if not in gross, and sparked off the mass franchise series we know today.<br/><br/>The extra 17 minutes of the extended video release are actually quite vital, showing the fenced-in crew setting up computer sentries, emphasising the dire nature of their circumstance. Even more significantly, they added depth to Ripley by showing that her daughter had aged and died during the time she had been away. For Aliens takes place fifty-seven years later, where the shuttlecraft of the original (expertly recreated, even down to a look-alike cat) is picked up by scavengers. Once back on Earth, Ripley is emotionally blackmailed into taking a group of space marines out to the planet where they discovered the aliens, as it is now populated by a colony. The planet of the original is named as LV426, and the year the colonists inhabited the planet as 79. But which '79? For the sake of keeping it contemporary, let's assume it's 2079. Aliens takes place 20 years after colonisation, thus dating Alien at 2042. (Okay, I'm an anorak!) <br/><br/>While looked upon as the most action-packed, a single shot isn't fired before the first 43 minutes are up. But from then on it's pretty gung-ho all the way, Aliens getting shot in the brains, etc. All the characters are known only by their ciphers  sorry, surnames  so that the rather sleazy, back-stabbing government official (who it's obvious is a traitor from the first minute), is named ""Burke"", and the most macho soldier ""Spunkmeyer"". Cameron even tried to unite this series with The Terminator, having Cyberdene responsible for the creation of the ""synthetics"". He bottled it, and changed it to ""Hyperdene"". Weaver plays Ellen, lest we forget, though introduces herself as ""Ripley"" to all, including the frightened Newt. Henn gives a good performance as the orphaned girl, along with Biehn and the underused Henriksen. The rest, though, are merely juvenile military types, ready to get blown away. And that's basically it. The crew never become real people, save for perhaps Biehn, as they are all stereotypical macho types, including the women. <br/><br/>Cameron's direction is adequate, though the use of fades is a little obvious. Effects are obviously an improvement, this being seven years later in filmic terms, though shots of the actors in front of large explosions are notably fake. For its time, Aliens was state-of-the-art, but now it has been surpassed by others (including, ironically, Cameron's own later work), it must be judged on other merits. And that is where the problem lies. For away from the dumbed-down action and non-realism of the plot, there is little to recommend it. And surely Ripley would have been torn apart by the lack of air pressure at the climax? So that's Aliens, then. Good, nonsense, shoot-'em-up, just like the video games. But little else. Better than the original? I don't think so. Though Ripley does get bigger pants. 6/10."

","Siqourney Weaver at the peak of her acting career. Its very rare to see a sequel surpass all expectations. The movie does a great job at making you feel the tension at critical moments. They also manage to advance the plot in a good direction that makes sense.possibly the best sequel ever made."
"uasmae_simoi","10","3","3","18 December 2019"," A Classic
","The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.<br/><br/>It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.<br/><br/>It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)"

","In this film, James Cameron not only did justice to the original, but added so much to this world that it changes (for the better) the way we view the first one. Even though this film isn't the same genre as its predecessor, it made the smart choice of attempting to be a fast paced action film and, wow, did it work. Great cinematography , pristine direction and action packed, suspenseful storytelling mix in to make a absorbing and visually striking movie. Weaver's performance was outstanding and Cameron's vision, spot on. Except for some green screen that doesn't hold up as well, this film is near flawless. 8.5/10 for me in the enjoyment factor, but being objective in its quality: 10/10"
"SnoopyStyle","9","5","6","12 October 2013"," Great follow up
","It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.<br/><br/>James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times."

This was a vastly different, and more expensive film than its predecessor: with its dialogue-heavy first half setting up the relentless action of the remainder - a fight to the death between the aliens and their human adversaries. It's well-executed and technically brilliant, if not as memorable as Scott's effort. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly named Aliens as the second-best action film of all time, behind Die Hard (1988)."

","Well, Alien is without a Science fiction/horror classic, but the 1986 sequel is the kind of film that in some ways surpasses the original, and can also do the series justice (corny I know) and pretty much becomes one of the most original, special effects gold, acted greatly (Weaver can't get much better than this), and exciting to watch sequels of all time! The music is some of the best i've herd of Goldsmith, if he composed, the way it sounds like something by todays standers and can really grab you're attention. <br/><br/>The character development is better than I expected, seeing as you come to know these Marines and relate to us (much like in The Thing, one of my favorites.) <br/><br/>The special effects are so good, most people say ""this move is way ahead of it's time!"" My response is, Agreed. <br/><br/>The plot is at first view (for people we aren't SciFci nerds, I'm one) hard to understand, unless you watch this movie many times, What I did with the Thing. <br/><br/>The quotes are really memorable; such as ""GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVVVERRR!!!"" or ""Get away from her, YOU BITCH!!! I love the dialogue, it's just plain good.<br/><br/>Overall, watch this film if you enjoyed T2: Judgement day, The Thing, Alien, or Invasion of The Body Snatchers, or just want to have a thrilling, epic, long (I have the uncut version), cool, outstanding, groundbreaking, or just plain great this October, then you need to see ""Aliens"""
"Tweekums","9","5","6","27 August 2008"," A great sequel to a classic film
","Too often sequels are shallow rehashes of what was done in the first film, thankfully think isn't the case with Aliens which is almost as good as the first and quite different in style. While I think it helps to see the original film first this also works as an excellent piece of stand alone entertainment.<br/><br/>This film is set fifty seven years after the events of the first film however for Ripley it is as if no time has passed as she was in hyper sleep the whole time. Upon waking she is horrified to discover that the planet where the crew of the Nostromo found the alien is in the process of being Terraformed. A family group is sent out to investigate the location of the ship and one of those people is attacked by a face-hugger, soon after all contact with the outpost is lost. Ripley is asked to join the group of marines being sent to investigate but initially doesn't want to go, she changes her mind once assured that they are going to eliminate the aliens.<br/><br/>Unlike the first film where there is a single alien this time there are hundreds although they are more easily killed as the marines are obviously well armed. The frights and horror of the first film are much reduced but are replaced by the excitement of full on action as the marines battle against the aliens. The acting is solid through out and particular mention should be made of Carrie Henn, who played ""Newt"" a young girl who was the sole surviving colonist. In many films the presence of a child is rather annoying but Newt was a good character who wasn't overly cute, she could also scream rather well!<br/><br/>This review and rating are based on watching the longer Special Edition of the film which includes many scenes not in the original release."
"cab-consumer","9","5","6","22 June 2008"," Wonderfully tense sci-fi fantasy
","Aliens is a thrilling film. Throughout the plot is on a thrill ride which never seems overly contrived. And, in contrast to a lot of films I have seen, you actually come to care about the characters here. The motherly relationship between Ripley and Newt is particularly resonant; a tender eye of the storm of this monster yarn. You will come to love the marines too. Bill Paxton is great as Hudson, Michael Biehn as Hicks. You will boo at the sliminess of Burke and the wimpyness of Gorman.<br/><br/>Signourney Weaver has a wonderful quality about her as Ripley. A stark beauty and a quiet assurance. Lance Henrikson as Bishop also plays a good character.<br/><br/>This is a well written, expertly executed, brilliantly realised sci-fi yarn that will have you chewing your finger tips off with suspense.

"evanston_dad","8","5","6","31 March 2008"," James Cameron's Powerhouse Sequel to ""Alien""
","Say what you will about James Cameron's attempts at more ""serious"" film-making (""Titanic""? Ha!), the man does know how to put together an action movie. He takes a completely different approach to this second film in the ""Alien"" series than Ridley Scott did to the first -- whereas Scott's film was slow, creepy and scarier for what you didn't see than for what you did, Cameron's is nearly non-stop hard-core action. It works though, and for all the difference in their styles, the two films cohere very well together.<br/><br/>In this sequel, the focus moves away from the science/research angle of the first and instead focuses on a group of marines sent to a ghost town of a space station to investigate the disappearance of the colonists. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is along for the ride again, and Cameron uses her fear of what they could potentially be walking into effectively. Whereas in the first one, we were scared because we shared the scientists' cluelessness about what was going on and only learned things as they learned them, in this one we're scared in the same way Ripley is, precisely because we know what's going on and how terrifying it is. And Cameron ups the ante here -- instead of one single alien as a nemesis, this group of marines has to deal with hundreds of them.<br/><br/>I'm not really a fan of the subplot involving Newt, the little girl the marines find and who forms an attachment to Ripley. But the story does give Ripley's character a lot of motivation and makes her stand off with the aliens much more personal.<br/><br/>I've seen this film a few times, so you'd think it wouldn't hold any suspense for me now, but I just watched it again over the weekend and damned if I wasn't on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"DarthGazak","10","5","6","23 February 2006"," Xenomorphs are back!
","This is an excellent sequel to a truly groundbreaking original. Cameron has developed this new genre and places more emphasis on electrifying action than the original sci-fi horror classic did, and elevates Ellen Ripley into a genuine 'femme-fatal' as she once again destroys her sworn enemies. With the help of some admittedly 'gung ho' redneck marines, Ripley overcomes her terror and saves the day. It's not all furious gun-play and acid blood, there are some emotional scenes as Ripley replaces her now dead daughter(Ripley was in cryo-sleep for around 50 years) with an orphaned girl on the alien infested planet. Great stuff from a great director."
"siit","9","5","6","21 January 2006"," How a follow up movie should be done !!
","Aliens highlights and perfectly illustrates the arrogance of man's (and especially the American) attitude and supposition of superiority over all things. It also highlights the despicable lengths that corporations will stoop too to generate money. Maybe thats a cynical view but none the less it is true.<br/><br/>The movie itself is fabulous. Gone is the rackety bucket of the Nostromo and in its place is the next evolutionary step what is expected 50 plus years later. However the technology is not overbearing and is entirely plausible for soldiers. The ships look fantastic, the weapons are awesome and I am still waiting for the 'Loader' as a Christmas present.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Ever since Terminator, I have been a massive Michael Biehn fan and he didn't fail to deliver. Bill Paxton's Hudson is an instant classic and he is responsible for some of the most truly memorable lines in the movie. The human villain in Aliens plays his role so well, I was actually guilty of not liking the actor for years because I couldn't overcome his absolute credible portrayal of a man consumed with loyalty to his corporations avarice.<br/><br/>Of all the Alien franchise movies, Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance. You feel her xenophobia and believe the outright terror she feels. The solo preparation of her ride down the elevator is some of the best acting I have ever witnessed. The interaction between characters is surprisingly in-depth and varied to say Aliens is primarily a sci-fi action movie; true camaraderie, distrust, blossom of love, deep respect, intense dislike and more are examined in and unfolded in a totally believable and well executed manner. I also loved the mix of male and female in equal risk taking/responsibility roles and I love the fact the 'true' equality is not rammed down the audience's throat.<br/><br/>We get to see more of the 'alien' in this outing but realistically it's more quick edited shots. However the mother of all aliens makes her appearance and she is phenomenal. If you haven't seen Aliens, the first time you see her, you will be awestruck.<br/><br/>The major difference between Alien and Aliens is the way the horror and thrill is extracted from the audience. Alien is very claustrophobic in its suspense and setting and is so successful. Aliens on the other hand has some elements of that claustrophobia, however the pace is higher and the audience is swept along with multiple jumps, startles, and action scenes all to a brilliant and most befitting musical score.<br/><br/>Aliens is a must see cult classic, and like all the movies in the Alien saga, the Director's cut is the version that is essential to view. A large majority of Alien saga fans rate this movie the best, it is certainly close."

"G'aal","10","5","6","29 October 1998"," The ""perfect organism"" en masse in the perfect movie
","""Aliens"" is, without question, the greatest science fiction action/adventure movie of all time.  This is a spellbinding, jaw-dropping epic of a movie masterpiece that pulls off the rarest of feats -- it actually tops its predecessor, the inimitable ""Alien"", even going so far as to make it look the slightest bit campy and predictable by comparison (though it still remains a groundbreaking, chilling, landmark science fiction/horror classic).<br/><br/>""Aliens"" interweaves competing themes and juxtaposes action, character development, suspense, cameraderie, fear and heroism brilliantly.  The movie is far more multi-faceted than the original, which surpassed it on the horror and suspense fronts only.  ""Aliens"" adds doses of realism to make the entire viewing experience seem more ""human"" -- the Hudson whining at times seems ad-libbed, the dialogue is unmatched in a movie of its genre and the heroism is, remarkably,  under-glorified.  The characters make mistakes throughout the movie, a deft touch by Cameron and counter to the typical Hollywood action hero ""kick ass"" mentality.<br/><br/>Every single character in ""Aliens"" is likeable at one time or another, even the villain Burke.  Think of all the great ensemble casts you've seen in the past, whether they be on television (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""Cheers"") or on the silver screen (""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", etc.).  Psychologically, this is an important method to convey and establish a connection between the viewer and the movie.  Conversely, movies that fail to develop that connection sufficiently tend to suffer as a result. ""Aliens"" far and away does the best job of this in the entire series, well ahead of the original and light-years ahead of the successors.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the third installment was flawed, choppy and illogically constructed but nonetheless a worthy effort and the fourth a debacle in both form and function.  My suggestion is that the viewer pop in the original, view and enjoy its atmosphere and cat-and-mouse terror, then immediately view the roiling, adrenaline-inducing, light-speed second installment.  You will walk away from that session marvelling at how this franchise was born and raised.  See the third one at a later date and consider the fourth one a wayward child and move on."
"onepotato2","8","14","22","16 February 2008"," The good kind of escapism
","I've been a fan of this movie for over 20 years now. It's hard to believe the years have passed so quickly since it made the cover of Time magazine! 'Aliens' owes everything to 1) a wonder of a script that gives even those in small roles, who may only have a handful of lines, a pretty defined character. Structurally it's very intelligent, and every single new character in the large cast is memorable. 2) Syd Meads impressive gadgets 3) Sigourney Weaver! who knows enough to be fierce AND scared, and is given sequences where she can actually save some of this crew. Which is not to say that other elements aren't also impressive (score, camera work, fx, editing and... it goes without saying, direction). You never doubt this world exists for a moment. It's so convincing and alive. All that, while being true to the first movie, while freeing itself up in amazing ways. Every choice is smart and produces a better movie than the usual cop-outs one finds in a sequel. All this and the only role Bill Paxton has ever been good in.<br/><br/>In 1986 this movie delivered shock after shock in scenes that have since become boilerplate. It's a catalog of continually hopeless scenarios dropping while Ripley soldiers on: Your sole means of getting off a planet has just crashed in front of you? Keep a tough disposition, be a hard-ass and work it through. She wipes the floor with the Marine troop she's supposed to be depending on. The movie has more than rewarded your interest before the very cool climactic brawl plays out. I see about three movies a decade that don't blow their final act. <br/><br/>Weaver is so awesome as Ripley that it's hard to believe that once she owned the franchise, she made such dependably rotten decisions. Cameron drunk on kudos went on to write the simpering, facile script for Titanic, which means his writing and evaluative skills are not as honed as Aliens would suggest. If you haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>(I always found it amusing that planets and spaceships helpfully count down their own destruction)"

","Sequels are often hated with a passion. All sorts of action packed movies usually find a sequel - Batman had his, as did Superman. So did the 1979 classic science fiction thriller Alien, directed by Ridley Scott. <br/><br/>Aliens, a catchy name for a sequel, was directed by James Cameron, who two years earlier directed the hit action science fiction movie Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Cameron, an action director, obviously had a lot to say in the production. So why didn't I like it as much as the first one?<br/><br/>Number one has to be the cast. The cast in the first was a small one, maybe ten actors at tops, but they were all awesome. Weaver was much different, although I have no complaints about his work in the sequel. The cast in the second one I found really irritating, although many have loved Bill Paxton ever since, I found him annoying. As for Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen, I have no complaints, they did a marvelous job. But the woman who played Vasquez, and the whole character of her's was just bad.<br/><br/>Number two would have to be the way it's directed. It's no longer a science fiction movie, it's no longer a thriller or even a horror movie, it's an action movie, with lots of explosions and weapons and fire and all that. I was disappointed with the whole plot outline, the whole movie has just been constructed around battle scenes that many people appreciate. But not I.<br/><br/>As a sequel that's been praised through the roof by so many, I have to say that the prequel once again triumphs. Scott's direction is much more beautiful, the cinematography is better, the score is better and the movie is scarier and more scientific as a whole than this one. I gave this one a six, I think I gave the first one a ten. But just to end this review, I highly recommend this to the people that like to find out what happens after the first one and to those who like action movies with some spooky scenes."

Furthermore , a colorful and adequate cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The motion picture lavishly produced by Gordon Carroll , David Giler , Walter Hill and Gale Anne Hurd was perfectly directed by the great James Cameron . <br/><br/>There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997).

"Murdoch584","6","82","165","4 August 2007"," Pathetic Rehash of the First
","After being extremely impressed with Alien, I'll admit I was a bit skeptical as to how anyone could top it. For better or worse, I had seen and hated The Terminator and T2 so already I didn't think much of Cameron. His plots are riddled with holes and he populates his films with irritating characters. About forty five minutes into Aliens I was rooting for the aliens. Here are my specific problems with the film:<br/><br/>1. Newt: She serves absolutely no purpose in the movie except as a half-a**ed attempt by Cameron to get us to sympathize with Ripley since she's missed her daughter's life. Now there was definitely potential here except that Newt uttered one of two lines the whole movie: ""Ripley!!!!!"" and a scream that sounded like a high pitched test pattern.<br/><br/>2. Bill Paxton: I like the guy as an actor in other movies. However, it was almost like Cameron's direction to him went as follows: ""Be as annoying as possible and make sure to say 'man' to let everyone know you just finished a sentence."" When his character died (far too late into the movie), it was akin to the joy I felt when I got over pneumonia.<br/><br/>3. The plot: I remember asking myself ""what the hell is this? Isn't this just the same plot as the first one with worse acting?"" Sure enough, it was. Let's compare (SPOILER FOR ALIEN AND ALIENS): <br/><br/>Alien: people in space have to go to a planet to check out a problem. Things are not as they appear and the alien hitches a ride aboard the spaceship after a face hugger clamps on to a crew member. It kills the crew members one by one as they try in vain to kill it. Then it's discovered that the company just wants the alien as a biological weapon. One of the crew members is in on the whole thing and tries to stop everyone from killing it. Doesn't work out though. Ripley, the only one left except for the cat, thinks she's killed the alien and flies away in the escape craft. Turns out the alien followed her onto the escape ship. Ripley ends up launching it out of the airlock. She goes to sleep in the hibernation chamber.<br/><br/>Aliens: people in space need to check out a problem ON THE SAME PLANET AS THE FIRST ONE WHERE FOR YEARS THEY SOMEHOW NEVER NOTICED THE GIANT CRASHED ALIEN SPACECRAFT RIGHT NEXT TO THEIR COLONY. A face hugger latches on to one of the people in the colony and eventually everyone dies. Marines show up. The aliens kill the marines one by one. Turns out that once again, the company has sent someone to recover the alien as a biological weapon (what are the odds?). Doesn't work out for him either. Anyway, all the useless characters die and the three survivors are forced to escape. And then, LO AND BEHOLD, THE ALIEN HAS HITCHED A RIDE ON THE SHIP. The absolute kicker comes at the end when Ripley kills the queen. How, you ask? BY LAUNCHING IT OUT OF THE AIRLOCK (more on this later). To wrap it all up, everyone goes into hibernation at the end.<br/><br/>How original. On to my next point: <br/><br/>4. The marines: When Cameron wrote dialogue for them, he must have had a big book of clichés to refer to. I know quite a few marines and none of them talk like that. And then there's the scene where they had to collect the ammunition. Are the marines in the future just overgrown kids in a daycare center? Never mind that right after the commander collects the ammo, he somehow doesn't notice that everyone has either put in another clip or pulled out another gun.<br/><br/>As a sub point to that, there is that reactor thing that shouldn't be ruptured (remember? That's why all the ammo was collected). When the aliens show up there are bullets flying everywhere and amazingly, no bullets penetrate the reactor thus blowing all the marines and this horrible movie to kingdom come.<br/><br/>5. The aliens themselves: Gone is the creepiness of the alien who adapts to its environment and transforms its victims into eggs and hosts. Instead we have an overgrown ant colony which, essentially, makes this a hollow rip-off of the 1954 movie Them! At least in Them! the ants were actually scary. The aliens in Aliens seem to have gotten much stupider since the first one.<br/><br/>6. Ripley's role: So they bring her along because she's the only one to have seen the alien. That would mean that they probably figured they should listen to her. Nah, that would make too much sense. Instead, they drag her halfway across the galaxy just to tell her to shut up. She could have been left out of the movie and it wouldn't have mattered.<br/><br/>7. The airlock scene: So the alien queen is about to be sucked out the airlock, so she grabs onto Ripley's leg. Let's pretend that the laws of physics are actually at work here. Ripley's leg should have been pulled right out of its socket. But in a movie already full of incredible idiocy, at that point, it's of little consequence.<br/><br/>I could go on but it's painful to try and relive this pathetic waste of film. I do have three good things to say about it though:<br/><br/>1. The queen looked cool. 2. Paul Reiser was the only likable character 3. Lance Henriksen was also cool, but very underused."

","Alien is a brilliant film. The atmosphere, acting, direction, and story progression are near perfect. Aliens, however, is the near opposite. The movie is one absurd action scene after another; which culminates in Sigourney Weaver's character, Ripley, fighting a giant alien while operating a mech suit. The entire movie was just ignorant.<br/><br/>But, as bad as everything was, there was one thing, one thing, that really, really made me mad: Aliens seems to disregard everything we learn about the ""monster"" in Alien. In Alien, there was no way to stop the thing, it was a tank, and if you got within a few feet of it, you were probably going to die. Not in Aliens though. In this movie the creatures (now dubbed Xenomorphs) are mowed down like deer. That's not the creature I remember. I remember that thing being unstoppable.<br/><br/>Overall, all James Cameron accomplished with this flick is to make me respect Alien, more than I already did. I love Alien. I wish Aliens had remained in Jim's brain though, along with Avatar."
"the-timelord-victorious","5","35","67","26 June 2012"," SO Overrated!
","So yeah, where do I start? First of all, I'd like to say that I absolutely love 'Alien', it's a brilliant, tense and exciting film. Easily a solid 5 star for me. And after watching the constantly praised follow up, I've came to the conclusion that 'Aliens' is the equivalent to 'Terminator 2' to 'The Terminator'. The only difference is, that T2 was actually a good film. I feel like I've wasted a good 2 hours of my life, and I have no doubt in my mind that 'Aliens' is one of the most overrated movies in existence.<br/><br/>The first thing that threw me off, and it is a very minor thing, so I'm not going into too much detail, is that we first find out that Ripley has awoken nearly 60 years after the events of Alien. This is fine, but my problem is, why announce this important piece of information in a dream? To my knowledge this was the first time we were told about the time jump, so wouldn't it be more PRUDENT to mention it in the 'real world' just to stop confusing people whether or not this happened or not.<br/><br/>Anyway, yes, the first 35 minutes of this are surprisingly good. I really enjoyed the hearing sequence, and I find it possibly the strongest scene in the entire movie. Once we get to the base though, I think this is where the film starts to go dramatically down hill, and this is why. I just don't care. I sat for 2 hours in that film, not caring about what was happening, not because I didn't want to, it was because it was unegaging and boring. First of all we're introduced to a group of Squad members, who are probably the most annoying group of people I've ever seen on screen. I'm not even going to waste my time talking about Blake, Husdon and Vasques. The first two really could've been the same character and the third spends the entire movie standing around dramatically looking like a really muscular Halle Berry.<br/><br/>Bar Ripley, Cameron has given us virtually no emotional connection to any of these characters. There were moments where soldiers were dying every 5 minutes and I just didn't care, and the fact that I didn't care completely took me out of the film, and made every bit of character motivation for me annoying, because I just couldn't feel it. No matter how urgent or how dangerous the characters tell me this entire situation is, it just doesn't feel threatening, and this is probably the worst thing about the film. The best thing about 'Alien' is that you did feel emotionally involved, it had genuine suspense and atmosphere, with 'Aliens' the entire thing has just been lost, there's virtually nothing in there at all to set this apart from other horror/action movies. The only startling imagery in the entire thing, was the scene involving the dead bodies cacooned in the cieling, and the woman turning out to be alive. This was quickly ruined however, by the obvious 'chest bursting scene', which I knew was coming and was waiting for it. The problems with most sequels is that half of the time they want to try something very new and inventive, and the other half of the time, they just repeat themselves. I had no doubt in my mind that a chest bursting scene would happen. Saying that though, I did enjoy the scene at the start, but I knew since when that happened Cameron was pretty much like ""Ah nahh, I'm just kidding, wait for later!"", so I spent the entire movie up to then, just expecting it, which I wouldn't of done if I actually was emotionally involved in the movie, which I wasn't, because this is pretty much something else that Cameron has ruined with his generic direction.<br/><br/>To me 'Aliens' pretty much consisted of one absurd action scene after another. I felt totally uninvolved, and the entire movie just had no heart at all. There's no sense of terror, no sense of claustrophobia, which I have to add the first film did incredibly well. It's just nonsense, with no emotional centre. I really did enjoy Sigourney Weavers performance though, even though I found it a little wooden in places. Other than that, I think she did a good job, and I was thankfull they kept her as the prominent main character and at the front of all the action. Other than that, very disappointing. How people see this as the 'definitive' Alien film is beyond me."
"kclipper","10","7","10","23 July 2011"," Flawless sequel delivers on every level! A perfect movie!
","James Cameron has an uncanny knack for taking an initial idea and elaborating on it in order to produce an entirely new experience, gaining the appreciation of old fans and attracting new ones as he crafts highly ambitious blockbuster smash hits. 'Aliens' is probably one of the most incredible feats in action film history as well as perfect sequel to an already classic monument of science fiction/horror.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the last survivor of the 'Nostromo' after defeating the dreaded 'Alien' and surviving a 57 year ""hypersleep"", she awakens only to be plagued by nightmares of the ""chestburster"" and discover her daughter is dead (a theme that was tragically omitted by 20th Century Fox, and is a pertinent backdrop for the human story). Ripley returns to the planet LV-246 with a group of highly trained space-marines (exposing some humorous Vietnam war clichés) to do battle with not one, but dozens of the horrifying creatures, featuring H.R. Giger's original design enhanced by the talents of animatronics extraordinaire, Stan Winston. <br/><br/>This is a brilliant film-making experience. James Cameron's attention to detail and grasp of technological improvisation is only matched by his ability to bring the best out in his cast of well-crafted characters. Among the highlights are: Bill Paxton as the false fronting chronic complainer, Lance Henrickson as the ""kind"" android, Bishop (the role that made him a genre icon), Michael Biehn as the quiet, heroic leader, Paul Reiser as the greedy company man (who contributes a suspenseful subplot involving sabotage and double-cross), Carrie Henn as a resourceful little girl, plus many more. Sigourney Weaver's Oscar nominated performance gains her notoriety as the first female action hero, especially in the unforgettable climax with the alien ""queen"", and the special effects will make the most skeptical viewers say, ""How the hell did they do that?"" Not enough words can describe this action packed, roller-coaster ride of a movie. Just when you think things couldn't get any worse for the doomed cast, another perilous pitfall is added to their plight, and it's all done at a brilliant pace and agonizingly tense coherency. <br/><br/>Hats off to those who restored this for the 2003 Director's Cut Special Edition! Cameron's essential 17 minutes of footage that was needlessly butchered brings depth and enlightenment to the plot, and newcomers to the hybrid sci-fi/horror/action genre will admire it for years to come. Its a definitive example of a tour de force of sight and sound at its very best."
"CalvinValjean","10","7","10","1 January 2010"," The Best Action Film Ever Made
","Most people will tell you the best action movie of all time is either Raiders of the Lost Ark or Die Hard. Both good. But Aliens has a striking maturity to it, due mostly to Sigourney Weaver's performance and the gritty, military environment.<br/><br/>Aliens will always be one of my all-time favorite films. The first film introduced us to the alien species, and features excellent direction by Ridley Scott, but THIS is the film that really established this universe, its technology, and who Ripley is, and it's THIS film that all the other Alien sequels have been compared to. James Cameron, who has proved himself a great director and science-fiction writer, took what Scott created and made his own epic.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain why Aliens is loved by so many. It has a strong human element, brought about by the Ripley-Newt relationship. Most action movies try to tack on love stories, that usually feel clichéd. The mother-daughter angle was a surprisingly nice touch, yet it is done without being overly sentimental or hokey. Carrie Henn gives a fine performance, while Sigourney fully deserved her Best Actress nomination.<br/><br/>The visual effects are so good that you often are unaware of them. It was not until recently checking out the DVD features that I realized many of the ""sets"" are actually miniatures. The score by James Horner (despite the off-screen tension between Horner and Cameron) is one of his best. The Sulaco is a beauty to look at, as is much of background of this film. The supporting characters really establish a family of marines. Part of the reason this film holds up to repeat viewings is how colorful each character is, even the ones that die early in the film like Apone and Frost. The humans are truly the focus of the film, not the aliens. In fact, it is over an hour before the aliens even first appear.<br/><br/>But for anyone who complains this pacing is too slow, don't worry, you'll get your money's worth of action in the last 40 minutes. The tension in the final sequence when the Queen Alien is first introduced always raises my blood pressure. This would be the peak of the series.<br/><br/>The only real criticism I've ever had of the movie is that the title is a bit plain and generic. Every time I say ""I love the movie Aliens"" I feel a little silly, and I usually have to clarify by adding ""you know, the James Cameron movie"" so the other person knows what I mean.<br/><br/>Well, rest assured, Aliens (you know, the James Cameron movie) is actually excellent film-making with an iconic and complex heroine, and one of its kind: a war movie in outer space."
"Medacakathareal","10","7","10","4 October 2008"," One of the Best Sci-Fi Films Ever
","Aliens is by far one of the best Science Fiction movies ever conceived. James Cameron, on a low budget that should shame Hollywood today, takes Ridley Scotts creature and makes it his own. While Alien is, undoubtedly, a masterpiece of a monster movie Cameron takes the idea one step further. The sleek ""perfect"" animal of Sir Scott's original is replaced by a battle-ready race of drones ready to do the bidding of their Queen. Cameron uses a squad of space marines who must go head to head with the Aliens to tell the story as they go from being on a rescue mission to just trying to stay alive themselves...<br/><br/>The film features top-notch acting from all sources, including one of the strongest female characters in science fiction history, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). Despite being pre-CGI the film delivers special effects that still hold up to this day. The film uses suspense and action more than horror but there are moments that will have your skin crawling.<br/><br/>This film's influence can be seen far and wide and references to it are fairly common especially in video games (Halo borrowed heavily from this movie)...<br/><br/>Great special effects, solid acting, solid writing, suspense and action (as well as comedy relief courtesy of Bill Paxton), make this an essentially perfect movie..."

","Great action, great story, but most of all, just a fantastic cast that really knows how to humanize a story. Very much in line with the original, and James Cameron makes sure that he doesn't completely ignore the events of the first film which is so often what sequels with different directors do. There seems to be a lot more action in this one than in the original, which was basically a horror film with some action elements. The characters combat the aliens and in some cases are killed by the aliens in very memorable, distinct ways. The script is sharp as a knife and can bring a tear to your eye at any moment, but also is very funny and keen. Jim Cameron is a great storyteller/director, and when he does both write and direct a movie, you know you're in for a real treat. Aliens gets a perfect 10/10."

It was a movie light years ahead of its time and showcased James Cameron in my eyes as one of the worlds top directors.

","After the ending of ""Alien"", Ripley is finally rescued by a salvage team after drifting out in space for 57 years in hypersleep. Then she tries to explain what really happened all those years ago to the ""Company"" board, but they instantly turn the story down, much to her disbelief. However on the same planet where her previous crew found the Alien egg, she finds out that now a colony of families have moved there and they could be in serious danger and her fears are proved correct when And one of the main reasons why this is a sequel that works so well is because it's aware that its a sequel and its a real continuation of the first movie. And this and Terminator 2: Judgement Day are living proof of why James Cameron is the one and only guy to be making sequels and he can make his sequels just as good as, if not better than, the first movie.<br/><br/>Because that its a true sequel, you would expect Ripley to be even further developed, and she is. In ""Aliens"" you get to find out so many things about her that you didn't realize in ""Alien"", such as the fact that she had a daughter who died while Ripley was in hypersleep, wow what a shame, because of this she tries to make up for her mistake by bonding with Newt, whose family was killed by the Alien attack. And we even find out her first name towards the end And her development is actually continued from the first movie rather than her developments being abrupt and coming out of nowhere. And while Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar and she should've won obviously, because part of the reason why Ellen Ripley is an iconic character is not because of how she was written but how she was acted.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was among the best I've ever seen in any movie and it possibly rivals the one in ""Predator"" as the all-time greatest. The characters can remembered on the back of anyone's hand; Hicks, Vasquez, Hudson, Bishop, Burke and Apone and they all have their own thing for us to remember them by.<br/><br/>Hicks is blended in by the fantastic Michael Biehn as the silent, intelligent leader (""I like to keep this handy, for close encounters""). Vasquez is the totally bad@$$ woman pumped in sheer masculinity and toughness, (""I only need to know one thing, where....they....are). Bill Paxton is at his prime as Hudson, who acts tough all the time but is actually a timid little child inside (""How do I get out of this chicken$h!t outfit?""). And Bishop, the android with the big heart, plays an important role in Ripley's development through the movie, in ""Alien"" the android named ""Ash"" went berserk and made the crew expendable to get the alien organism since the start. And Ripley had an extreme distrust of Bishop even though Bishop is clearly gentle the minute you first see him. At the end they both make peace and sort it out when Ripley learns he ain't as bad and messed up as Ash was. And also, Paul Reiser is perfect as the slimy corporate guy who only wants to make a profit above other people's lives, and when he gets killed you're gonna stand up and cheer, I assure you. And Apone is the awesome sergeant who frequently belittles Hudson (""You secure that $h!t, Hudson!, ""Hudson, get over here, over here!"" in the film's funniest sequence).<br/><br/>The action is totally relentless and packs a heck of a wallop. But during the first hour you won't be seeing any of the aliens or the gunfights so we can focus on the characters and get to know them first. But the action has everything, big machine guns, flamethrowers, grenade launchers, you name it. And the final stand-off between Ripley on the loader and the alien queen (""Get away from her, you bi**h!"") is among one the greatest ever filmed and it might be the fact that it was really a girl on girl fight which makes it more unique. And that's also why it works as a sequel, because the overall tone is different compared to ""Alien"", and the worst thing that Cameron would've done was to make it a rehash of the original, but he avoided doing that at all costs. <br/><br/>And this isn't considered one of the best ever action movies because of the action itself, but because it depicts a once innocent woman who lost nearly everything by a hostile species and will do anything to avenge herself and also try to rebuild what she lost. Awesome, awesome movie, this gets a perfect score from me."
"vip_ebriega","10","11","18","20 February 2007"," The darn best monster movie of all time! (includes Special Edition DVD review)
","My Take: Takes the already remarkable concept of the original and improves upon it in every way. Sequels have never been this great!<br/><br/>(This is an extension of the review I wrote on February 2007)<br/><br/>If ALIEN was the 2001 of monster movies, its sequel ALIENS is its STAR WARS. Here's a sequel that knows that the only thing that would satisfy its fans is to give 'em exactly what they wanted. Then ALIENS adds in a little more to that successful recipe: breathless action, gripping tension, reliable characters and the slimiest monsters in all of movie history. The result isn't only a sequel that's better than the original, its one of the best movies of the genre.<br/><br/>Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) reawakened from here naturally-long hypersleep which began at the finale of the first ALIEN. Forward 57 years later. The world she knew was unlike anything she has seen before, but she really has no time to know anything else than this: the distant planet LV-426, the planet where they encountered the hostile space killer, has been colonized. And when communication on the LV-426 colony is lost, Ripley agrees to return to the hostile alien planet, this time, accompanied by marines, to investigate the sudden communication loss. Of course, this ain't just a technical failure. The slimy alien from the first film times 10 has overrun the colony, turning in into a dark, gooey wasteland; the perfect place for an all-out war that pits top-tech Marines against the slimiest monsters ever.<br/><br/>As a monster movie, ALIENS gives you your due, but not contented simply to give you your money's worth, ALIENS offers more, unexpected surprises. For a monster picture, there are some genuinely pleasant characters existing here. Sigourney Weaver, who hit big time for being the most reliable female action heroine in the original ALIEN, is able to stretch the personality of her character here. This time, we are able to see Ripley's maternal instincts when she claims responsibility for the safety of Newt (Carrie Henn), a little girl who has successfully survived the apocalypse of the outside world she lives in by climbing through hidden ducts. The climax inside the exploding atmosphere processing station won't soon be forgotten, and I'm not just talking about the explosions. In fact, I bet ALIENS is one kind of film you won't soon forget. Not the words you drop on an explosive monster movie.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5.<br/><br/>154-min Special Edition DVD review (submitted March 10, 2009): And to think, I thought ALIENS was good enough as it is! This Special Edition DVD, which I bought a few days ago, is everything this ALIENS fan could ever want. 17 minutes of additional footage, deleted prior to the films original 1986 release, is added in able to deepen the emotions and character development of this terrific film, while it also adds an additional (though easily expendable) action scene. The first added scene shows the newly awakened Ripley discovering that her daughter has just died... at the age of 60. So much for being there on her 11th birthday. But the scene everyone will get a real kick from is the scene where we catch a glimpse of the LV-426 colony before it is overrun by aliens, as well as a look on Newt and her family. Another scene has Ripley and Hicks exchange first names, which deepens the relationship between them. Add to that, there are a few extended scenes on the Sulaco and the Colony stations, as well as the aforementioned action scene which has the aliens cleverly trying to pass through the barricade of automatic weapons. Then of course, the film is presented in a clear, pristine transfer which makes the film look good for something released back in 1986. The special features aren't big, but if the best possible way to see this modern classic is what I'm looking for, I already got my end of the bargain."

","Director/Script: James Cameron, Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Paul Riser, Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn <br/><br/>Picking up right where the previous film left of, Ripley is wakened out of hypersleep by a salvage crew 57 years after the ship left the alien planet. She is brought back to the 'company' where she tells the story of what happened to the the rest of the crew. However, they don't believe her because the planet is now colonized with about 60 families living on it with no altercations. Evuantally, they loose contact with the colony so they want to send a group of marines to investigate and they want Ripley to go along as an adviser due to her knowledge of the planet. After they arrive on the planet, they discover that the whole colony has been massacred shy of a little boy and girl. The marines become victim.<br/><br/>These alien films are rather interesting to review because they are all so different and fans of the series have such passionate differences of opinion as to what their favorite one is, most people favoring the first two. Aliens may be second only to the Star Wars films in the loyal following it gets from its fans. Aliens is unique amongst sequels in that it is actually favored by many fans. No doubt about it, this is a very effective film. It's got good special effects, cinematography, and action sequences. This plays much more like an action film than the previous. James Cameron did not want to duplicate Ridly Scott's film so he took a whole different direction. He had earlier made the Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger which was also an action sci-fi. Scott's first Alien film was a much darker film with more elements of horror.<br/><br/>I am going to go against many fans (thank God IMDb doesn't list reviewers addressees!) but I was disappointed somewhat with this film. It's not a bad film by any means but I just don't think they were able to capture the same level of mystery or horror in this film which is also why I actually preferred the third one to this. I also felt this film to be to talky especially at the beginning. The marines where an overzealous, arrogant bunch much like the characters in Armagaden (although not that bad!). The crew in the first film were much more subdued in fact I'm not so sure they even liked each other! Anyhow, this is a good film overall but I am more of a fan of the first film."
"Mister-6","10","4","5","18 May 2000"," A rarity in the world of sequels....
","Can it be possible; a sequel that is as good, if not better, than the original?  Yes, it not only can be possible, it is, and ""Aliens"" not only proves a fantastic sci-fi movie in its own right but again proves the power that Sigourney Weaver has in the right film, as well as the over-powering direction of James Cameron.<br/><br/>Picking up 200 years after the fact, Weaver is once again thrown into a battle along with the Space Marines that are called to the planet where Weaver's team originally found the alien of the first film.  The colonies that have been built there have been obliterated of all life and they are being sent there to wipe out every last alien on the planet.<br/><br/>Of course, in a movie like this, nothing is as it seems, and that's a positive quality.  Weaver misses nary a beat as Ripley, a woman as un-trusting of aliens, most humans and just about anything else in general as she was before.  It's only when they discover a small girl (Carrie Hehn) left alive that she finally finds something that perhaps shows she has some feeling left.<br/><br/>Of course, there are other great performances by Biehn, Henriksen, Goldstein, Paxton and Reiser, playing well fleshed-out characters against a backdrop of desperation, fear and outright gut-wrenching horror as they find out their mission wasn't as easy as they all thought. <br/><br/>
But then comes James Cameron.  Having proven his mettle with ""The Terminator"", he works with a bigger budget and shows just as much ingenuity and flair for big, flashy action as any ten action directors.  But even if the story seems routine, Cameron's approach is not; he makes every single moment seem as fresh now as if it were being seen for the first time in motion picture history.  Always a good thing in science fiction, where there aren't exactly new ideas coming out every day.<br/><br/>As with the original ""Alien"" (and Cameron's ""Terminator""), the last half-hour or so is so much edge-of-your-seat and nail-biting tension that you'll feel like a wrung-out wash rag by the time all is said and done, and rightly so.  And, more than ever, you'll empathize with Weaver as her character fights not only for her own survival, but for that of others as well.  <br/><br/>So, ""Aliens"" is great science fiction and great film-making, but is it a worthy addition to the saga?  Most definitely, especially when you consider that most sci-fi films can't muster HALF the story this one does, much less a sequel to one.<br/><br/>Ten stars (eleven if I only could) to ""Aliens"", one of the best science fiction sequels (""Star Wars"" movies excluded) ever."

"carcar-759-676336","2","31","64","26 October 2013"," I am in the minority, I guess
","Upon re-watching this film with a friend I was sorely disappointed in how different this film was from what I remembered. I first saw this film as a child and thought it was terrifying and now I just think it's...terrifying in a completely different way. I find the majority of the characters surrounding Ripley bland. James Cameron, for whatever reason, decided that it would be a great idea to add a child into the mix that Ripley could feel motherly to. I think he assumed this would make women connect more to the film somehow, by saying women are at their best defending children, or something? Yeah, no.<br/><br/>I think the child was just an annoying, cheap distraction attempting to pull at the heart strings, which for me just became a hindrance to Ripley's character rather than advancing her. I get that Ripley's daughter dies because it is the future, but Cameron did not NEED to try to convince us she was oh so motherly by giving us Newt. Hick's is not only so bland, but he is oddly one of the few male characters out there that's sole purpose in a movie is to be a romantic interest for a female protagonist. Newt and Hicks are just there to create this paper family dynamic with Ripley. I don't know the last time I rolled my eyes so much.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the characters? All of the marines are nearly the same, save gender difference and the somewhat entertaining and sometimes annoying whiner of the group ""MAN!"", who is differentiated only by his cowardice and catchphrase. Some may say to change my mind... ""But it's an action film, not a horror film...it's a different tone..."" As an action film, I believe it is a poor one. There was a lot of off screen fire and when the aliens were shown it either didn't look menacing or there was just a lot of flashing lights where you could hardly see them.<br/><br/>The soldier gear was clunky and illogical... predicting that sometime in the future, rather than going smaller in technology we would strap clunky cameras to helmets and large obnoxious looking flashlights to the shoulder rather than make them discreetly smaller or more convenient. Neither of those pieces of technology would be convenient for a scientist OR a soldier, one swipe of an alien claw would knock those cameras and flashlights out.<br/><br/>Oh and let's talk about the ending for a moment which is supposed to be a callback to Alien where a suited up Ripley knocks that pesky alien off into space through an airlock. Wait, wait, wait...back up for a second. In Alien, she suits herself up, but in Aliens, she not only doesn't consider how this would effect Bishop and little Newt, but she OPENS AN AIRLOCK INTO SPACE WITHOUT A SUIT. SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFOCATED OR SUCKED OUT...or more than likely BOTH. It doesn't make sense as ""awesome"" as it looks. It is actually QUITE stupid, but yay, the alien is dead and SHE doesn't get sucked out and BISHOP doesn't get sucked out and NEWT doesn't get sucked out...and ...that doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Any redeeming moments were few and far between for me, but those moments simply move this film from one star to two. Yes it was the film that introduced the Alien Queen, but this ""iconic moment"" wasn't enough for me to enjoy the film as a whole. I consider this film one of the most overrated films out there undeserving of it's overall rating. So of course, at the end tralala, ""family dynamic"" survives along with the android and... blegh. I really did not like this film. Somewhere along the way in my life I must have confused this film with another that caused me to put it on some idealized nostalgia pedestal...<br/><br/>The best part of the entire film, which makes me giggle is ""They mostly come at night, mostly..."" I am just going to leave this review with that..."

","I remember having a conversation with a work colleague in 1983 on horror films ( In those days video nasties like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON were all the rage ) and he mentioned that he thought ALIEN was a great film . "" Hmm "" I replied "" I didn`t think it was that good Benny . It would have been better if there was more people getting killed by lots of aliens and a lot more action "" It could be that James Cameron over heard my conversation and decided he was going to make a sequel solely to please me , but it`s more logical to assume that he recognised the obvious faults of the pretentious arthouse original and went for a no holds action blockbuster<br/><br/>I really loved the action setpieces of ALIENS , the flames , the explosions , the gunfire , the high body count and the nerve jangling tension . Cameron does a great job and unlike his later films never goes overboard on the production values and a special mention should go to realistic little things like costume design . All too often directors shoot themselves in the foot by making the future look futuristic and fail because of it , check out UFO , THE GREEN SLIME and SPECE 1999  for a few examples , but here the costumes look very functional as opposed to futuristic . And Cameron has written a very good - though possibly overlong - script . Notice that it has - Unlike his script for RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART TWO - a slightly left of centre viewpoint with the marines being jingoistic American stereotypes and the bad guy being a corperate capitilist ? This no accident on the part of the screenwriter I`m sure<br/><br/>So with a few rare exceptions like MAD MAX 2 this is a film that outdoes the original . I know that some critics prefer Ridley Scott`s version and they`re entitled to their veiwpoint but Cameron proved the doom mongers ( And there was a lot of them in 1985 )  wrong when they announced that ALIENS wouldn`t come close to equalling never mind surpassing the original .<br/><br/>I`ve no idea what Benny thought of ALIENS  though"
"tedg","Null","12","21","27 June 2001"," Different Worlds
","Different Worlds<br/><br/>Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I've just rewatched `Alien,' `Aliens' and `Alien Resurrection.' Considered simply as films, each is a fine film but they come from worlds that are more different from each other than the normative world of now is to the world of any of them. Just viewing them is a course in filmmaking.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's `Alien' is the most impressive, knowing that it was only his second film, that every effect is physical, and that the budget was so low the spacecraft is cobbled together from used aircraft parts. Even at this early point, Scott has the ability to create a unique look and has the mastery of craft to coordinate every element (acting, score, movement) to reinforce that look. That he chose Giger to base the look on was brilliant. Organic darkness -- evil embodied in living things. The alien ship, though only briefly shown, is a sequence that will live way past the time that the monsters of the series are forgotten; that blending of beast, environment and narrative is unique in all filmdom. Really amazing that the sequels didn't go back to that ship. Scott has grown to be one of our best and most original filmmakers -- Alien and `Blade Runner' (with `Forbidden Planet') are the very best `real' scifi films we have, meaning films that are not just adventure films.<br/><br/>Where `Alien' is scifi in the service of horror, `Aliens' is scifi in the service of action. Aliens is a war film, and equally impressive as one of Cameron's earliest. Movement and conflict. More emphasis on the familiar is necessary for this approach, so we see the sets and costumes less adventuresome. This is a thrill which uses the trappings of scifi only as another thing with which to impress. The mood created is projected not into the image as with Scott, but into the theater as something to amaze. Cameron hasn't evolved at all from this film, only been given ever bigger effects with which to amaze. So one might consider this his most `genuine' film.<br/><br/>`Resurrection' seems to not be as admired by the fan base. But I think it every bit the equal of the other two. In this case, we also have a new director, a European with two fantasy tales under his belt. But those set a tone that is strikingly weird: the tone not in the setting, but in the psychological space in the story. And that's what we have here. In Cameron's film, every character is a stereotype. Here, every character is an anti-stereotype: the black guy isn't jive; the cripple is the toughest; the sex kitten is a robot... even the hero isn't really. This is also the most cinematic use of the camera, using the psychological eye. Scott dwells, Cameron moves, Jeunet examines. He doesn't mind annotating the past films (rather like Van Sant's `Psycho' annotates Hitchcock's).<br/><br/>The only negative thing I note in the sequels is that Weaver isn't adaptable enough to understand and get behind these diverse visions. She understands Scott. Cameron doesn't really care, but she is outclassed by Jeunet.<br/><br/>Seeing any one of these enhances the appreciation for the other two."

"Screen_Blitz","9","5","7","22 May 2017"," James Cameron's Aliens is a superb science-fiction experience that improves upon its predecessor
","Ridley Scott left a major landmark on the science-fiction genre when he brought birth to 1979's 'Alien'. Treating audiences with engrossing visual imagery and hair-raising thrills, there is almost no wonder the film journeyed to success. This follow-up to the science-fiction thriller arrives with more of the same pulse- pounding human vs. alien onslaught, only with more and bigger surprises. Replacing Ridley Scott in the director's chair is visionary James Cameron following his success with science-fiction hit 'Terminator'. Cameron comes to the picture with a slightly more thoughtful direction and a bigger package of spine-chilling thrills and sharp visual effects that amount to a masterful sci-fi experience. Reducing on the suspenseful atmosphere in favor of more even balance of action and white-knuckle thrills, the film never fails to show Cameron knows how to keep things working. Set almost six decades after the first entry, this film sees the return of Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, who wakes up from a cryogenic sleep and is facing charges from the catastrophe that lead to the death of her crew. With everyone back on Earth failing to buy into her story, Ripley goes on an investigation to another planet with a crew of space marines which include Corporal Hicks (played by Michael Biehn), Burke (played by Paul Reiser), Bishop (played by Lance Henrickson), Private Hudson (played by Bill Paxton), Lieutenant Gorman (played by William Hope), and Private Vazquez (played by Jenette Goldstein) along with a few others. Stumbling upon a colony of alien eggs that soon hatch and launch a violent onslaught against the crew, Ripley and the crew must fight to survive against the vicious horde while protecting a little girl named Newt (played by Carrie Henn) who's family has been killed. <br/><br/>Whereas the previous film relied heavily on suspense and Ridley Scott's Gothic imagery to unleash the thrills, James Cameron goes a significantly different route in portraying the humans' heart-racing battle against the grotesque-looking extraterrestrial creatures. This amounts to splicing some action sequences in the mix of the eerie atmosphere, which pits the characters in a scarier and more heart-pumping fight for survival against an overwhelming colony of flesh-eaters. By all means, Cameron's method works like a charm. He successfully showcases an even balance that of pulse-pounding action and rollicking thrills in a mix that effectively places viewers in a boiling good time, but not that isn't prone to inducing nightmares. The first half focuses on the buildup of the characters along with exposition before transpiring to the second half which eventually places its foot on the gas for some white-knuckle, if occasionally gory alien onslaught. To add spice to the tension, the film powerfully showcases the vulnerability of Carrie Henn's Newt, a small defenseless little youngster who Ellen Ripley must protect in the midst of the chaos. Although there are maybe a few dull moments sprinkled throughout the picture, Cameron never seems to struggle to keep things moving. The space marine characters are slightly more developed and the chemistry between each of them which includes a few brief dosages of humor and wit. Alongside, Cameron also manages to feast the eyes with striking visual imagery painting the inside of the spaceship, capturing the sheer claustrophobia of the settings while paying reminiscence to the original film. <br/><br/>With Ellen Ripley being the sole survivor of the aftermath of the first film, Sigourney Weaver returns to the lead role and is good as ever, if not slightly more. Weaver executes the role with same versatility and emotional grit of a strong female protagonist similar to the predecessor, particularly with her tough-as-nails line ""Get away from her, you bitch!"". The rest of cast consists of newcomers to the franchise including Paul Reiser as Corporal Hicks who shows off with a fairly decent performance. Michael Biehn plays Burke, a slightly more sinister and antagonistic member of the crew who shows little care of placing the crew in mortal danger. Biehn's performance stands strong, but certainly not in a fashion that stands out among anyone. Lance Henrickson does a fairly job at Bishop, the valiant one in the group. Jenette Goldstein, who would later go on to collaborate with James Cameron again for a minor role in 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', boasts an incredible amount of charisma in her role with a small slice of witty humor added to the mix. Then, there is young Carrie Henn who plays Newt, a small girl who becomes a daughterly-like figure to Sigourney Weaver during the terrifying chaos. The film does a magnificent job on not only showcasing the vulnerability of the small-aged character, but beautifully establishing the emotional bond between her and Weaver. The rest of the large cast also succeeds in getting the job. Nothing however, that comes close to blowing Sigourney Weaver out of the water. <br/><br/>Aliens is a superb science-fiction experience that boasts a thoughtful direction by visionary film mogul James Cameron, and an astounding blend of terrifying visual imagery and heart-stopping thrills. The film makes the rare achievement of improving upon the original, and that further demonstrates Cameron's immense talent."

","The slimy terrors in outer space return in this larger more action-packed sequel that rivals the original as a great sci-fi film. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is picked up 57 years later floating in space in her cryo-sleep. She is informed that a colony has been set up on the planet and it has recently gone silent. At the request of Weyland Corp. employee Burke (Paul Reiser), Ripley agrees to tag along on a mission with the colonial marines who hope to find out what happened to the colony. The marines are skeptical of what Ripley describes as a menacing force capable of taking out a whole crew, especially Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) and Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein). Ripley is also wary of the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) after her encounter from the previous film.<br/><br/>The squad heads down to the planet and finds the colony abandoned. There are signs of the aliens and only one survivor Newt (Carrie Henn). Led by Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews), the marines trace the colonialists' trackers to the energy facility of the terraforming structure. They have to give up their weapons so as not to blow the place up, a handicapping that I always thought reduced the action for this part of the film. Lt. Gorman (William Hope) gives the order and Apone collects all the ammo and grenades. Vasquez and Private Drake (Mark Rolston) keep a clip on them. Of course, the team gets caught off guard and slaughtered leaving only a few left alive including Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn).<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","One of the reasons I'm still clinging onto hope that the Avatar franchise isn't a one-hit wonder is because James Cameron has proved how well he can build out a world in a sequel. He did it with Terminator and he certainly did it with Aliens. It's not only a great sci-fi thriller, but it's easily one of the greatest action films to date.<br/><br/>With a much bigger budget and story, Aliens takes everything that was great with Alien, and doubles down on it. All while at the same time building his own world of Alien mythology that seems similar and different enough from Ridley Scott's film to succeed as a sequel and stand on its own. It's a hard thing to do, but amazingly Aliens does it. What's great about this adventure is that we know what to expect with the Xenomorphs. We know that these explorers and military personnel are in for a rude awakening when they reach the colony, but the film takes us on the journey anyway. Everything is avoidable, but yet, all of the character decisions feel logical anyway.<br/><br/>It's pretty amazing what 7 years can do to special effects and production designs. While Alien was very contained and simplistic, Aliens is just the opposite, bold with a massive scope. It's a testament to making films with real effects and minimal green screen and CGI, because films (and these in particular) are always scarier and more thrilling when everything feels real. In fact, you feel like you're going on this journey right alongside the crew, experiencing each gun shot and face-hugging with them. In this regard, Aliens plays as both a harrowing western, and an electrifying video game for the audience. That speaks to Cameron's masterful directing.<br/><br/>Cameron also manages to write and direct Ripley into one of the most recognizable action stars in film history. She wasn't granted a ton of action in the first film, and fittingly so, but Aliens turns a warrant officer into the queen of all things Xenomorphs. Which brings me to the theme of the film, which seems to be motherhood. It's a nice twist on gender stereotypes and harsh look into the struggle of a ""woman's voice"" in society. Ripley is questioned at every turn by most of the characters, even though she clearly has the most experience out of anyone. And I love how Cameron parallels Ripley with the ""Alien Queen"" at the end. Both of them trying their hardest to save their ""children"". <br/><br/>Aliens, much like Alien, is the perfect example of how to max-out the quality of your film in every aspect. Everything from the intense score, the gorgeous production design, the endless tension, and unique and memorable performances. Aliens is quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made.<br/><br/>+New take from Cameron<br/><br/>+Tension<br/><br/>+Ripley is now an action icon<br/><br/>+Bigger scope<br/><br/>10/10"
"ViktorDrake","10","5","7","15 May 2017"," The Greatest Sci-Fi War Movie Ever
","After the masterfully suspenseful horror/thriller of Alien, any sequel needed to do something different, and that was exactly what James Cameron came up with for Aliens. Where Alien is essentially a haunted house movie in space, Aliens is an all-out war movie in space.<br/><br/>The story fits PERFECTLY alongside Alien and there are no continuity lapses between the two. The characters are all totally believable, from the inexperienced and arrogant Gorman, through the cocky but cowardly (but ultimately heroic) Hudson, to the sleazy corporate ""suit"" of Burke. The cast do a fine job of bringing these characters to life, so much so that we can even accept Ripley's transformation into a kind of all-action female-Rambo by the end.<br/><br/>The effects are universally excellent with only a couple of fairly obvious rear-projection backdrops giving the game away nowadays. The practical Alien effects (and especially the Queen) are infinitely more scary and believable than the all-CGI-garbage that Alien:Covenant has recently foisted on the cinema-going public.<br/><br/>To be honest, the biggest ""downer"" of Aliens is how Alien 3 completely swipes away everything Ripley worked for in Aliens before the opening credits are done! But the fact that the biggest problem with Aliens is it's subsequent sequel should tell you all you need to know about it! It's an absolutely superb film which, along with The Empire Strikes Back and The Godfather Part II, has the rare accolade of being a sequel that more than holds it's own next to original. <br/><br/>Impossible to give this anything other than 10/10."

","I really enjoy alien as a film but I have to admit that I totally love aliens and believe it is a better movie and one of the best movies ever. The premise of the film sees Ripley get picked up years after alien, along with a group of marines she goes back to lv426 to investigate the new missing colony there. Sigourney weaver is back as Ellen Ripley and she is even better in this film then the first and she was even nominated for an Oscar for this role. She is one of the most action packed strong woman in a film ever and she delivers such a strong but lovable performance in this film that makes you truly care about her character. The rest of the cast is also absolutely awesome, the late great bill Paxton plays Hudson in this film and he is amazing in this film, he has the best lines in the film and I loved the humour that he brings to his role. Michael biehn from terminator plays corporal hicks and he is really good in this film , he has a rugged but charming characteristic to him and I liked his performance. The character of Vasquez is absolutely great she is the biggest badass in this film and I absolutely beloved her character. The character of newt is really important to the film and I absolutely love her relationship with Ripley an thought it really brought the emotion to this film. The story in this film is pretty simple like alien, but I give this film credit for doing something different then the first film. The chemistry between the team is great to watch and you truly care about the characters as they take on the xenomorphes. Similar to alien there are a few interesting twists in this story that help make it feel unique as well. The script has fantastic dialogue in it with humour that makes these characters really fun to watch and build the relationships between the squad. The drama towards the end of the film really works as well and helps build the emotion. The style of the film has some of the most awesome action scenes seen in recent memory that adds suspense and keeps the action up. Overall I love aliens and I think it is a must see especially if you appreciate action films."

","It's hard to sum up how much I love the entire 2hr 17mins of pure awesomeness that comprise this film. Did you know that you can wear out a DVD? I have done so with Aliens - twice. I even played, and enjoyed, the terrible Colonial Marines video game.<br/><br/>Some people argue whether this or the original Alien is the better movie, but for me there's really no contest. And the less said about the later sequels, the better.<br/><br/>I imagine you've already seen Aliens and are just reading this review to see how great other people also think it is, but if not, or if you haven't seen it for a while, then I recommend watching it again soon. It's amazing how good it still is, getting close to being 30yrs old.<br/><br/>I had the good fortune to watch it on the big screen last year as part of a Halloween double bill at my local cinema. It was heaven.<br/><br/>If you're watching it at home, I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version to get the full grainy goodness of the original picture.<br/><br/>10/10 perfection!"

But even these battle-hardened marines with all the latest weaponry are no match for the hundreds of aliens that have invaded the colony.<br/><br/>I have loved this movie ever since I saw it as a kid years ago. This was a Perfect sequel to Alien. One of the things I love about it is that it doesn't try to copy the original, it becomes it's own movie in a way. Sigourney Weaver is fantastic as Ripley who becomes a stronger character than she was in the first film and earns that in the end. Every actor does an outstanding job fully realizing their characters whether it's Michael Biehn (in my opinion) his absolute best performance as Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Bill Paxton as Hudson, Jeanette Goldstein as Vazquez, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Lance Henriksen as Bishop, Carrie Benn as Newt and many others. Each character is more memorable each time I watch it.<br/><br/>I personally found no flaws in this film. It is well paced with great action, great dialogue, a well-rounded story with a satisfying conclusion and a terrific score by James Horner.

"Leofwine_draca","10","5","7","17 March 2015"," All-time classic; one of the greatest films ever made
","What more can be said that hasn't been said before about one of the greatest movies of our time? One of Jim Cameron's top three films, this is by far the best of the ALIEN saga, an endlessly rewatchable piece of classic action cinema which can best be described as ""Vietnam in space"". The alien is back and has multiplied, so now we have the now-classic action premise of ""group of marines vs. invincible enemy"".<br/><br/>From start to finish this is perfectly made entertainment with every frame minutely conceived to be the best. The music is eerily gripping and there are dozens of one-liners to be had from Bill Paxton, excelling in his first big role as the comic relief. The horror and gore quotient hasn't been reduced at all, this is definitely not a film for the kids. But oodles of gripping suspense and guns-blazing action violence is the main thing this sequel offers and it still remains one of the best action classics of our time. Even now, when some of the special effects are starting to look a little ropey (most remain fantastic, however, especially the Queen) and when you begin to realise there are no more than six aliens on screen at one time, this is still pulse-pounding entertainment, packed with horror, suspense, tension and plenty of thrills.<br/><br/>The cast is efficient, an ensemble outfit that pays off nicely. Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance in her best role that she can never hope to better success-wise. Michael Biehn is the hard-but-human soldier who befriends her, Lance Henriksen has his mainstream breakthrough role as the likable android Bishop. Paul Reiser's Burke is one of the greatest portrayals of corporate evil I've seen, a fantastic show of strength, corruption, evil and cowardice from Reiser. The rest of the marines are great and, most importantly, believable and likable. The action never lets up and the extended version has to be seen to get the full story. Although it runs for two and a half hours this is a film that never runs out of steam; instead it will just age gracefully like the finest wines, sitting in its place in history as a classic of the '80s."
"secondtake","7","5","7","24 March 2011"," A functional plot built up with the most vivid and beautiful and demonic effects
","Aliens (1986)<br/><br/>I had a revealing experience these last two days. I heard ""Aliens"" without watching most of it (I was in the other room). And the script is really really bad. I mean stupid bad, with these quasi military people fighting against the monsters and saying canned military things that are taken not from real army dialog but from other movies. The events really boil down to a series of missteps, and even though this band of Marines is made of tough ""hombres"" sure enough, they can't seem to get along, or get things done, or even hold their overly heavy weapons up straight.<br/><br/>I did watch for part of it, and I have seen the movie more than once before, and I'm a fan of the first one, ""Alien,"" from 1979 (on the heels of the ""Star Wars"" craze). I expected it to be pretty good, like the first one, which has real character development and an original kind of premise. But...well, think again.<br/><br/>Hey, I agree with most--the set design, the sense of action, the light and camera-work, the whole larger than life experience of being in this forbidding place, this is all great. Even the over the top ""movie music"" is appropriately symphonic and big. There's no way around the fact the movie is well made, and feels convincing in these palpable terms. It looks great top to bottom, and even on contemporary terms (we are a quarter century later as I write), it is sophisticated. It has aged well. If that were all that mattered--and for some it might be!--then all is well.<br/><br/>But for me, I was still thinking there might be some interesting, chilling plot to follow. This second installment, always confusing in its plural title ""Aliens,"" is filled with a combination of stale ideas (taken politely from the first round) and romping action adventure boy stuff. It is if more intense than the first (more fighting, more firepower), but it's far less creepy. It has more goo, and more gore, but less horror, and less fear. <br/><br/>As with the original, the lead character is a woman, and indeed a whole bunch of the Marines are women, and so this is no simple manly movie. But it remains a macho movie, or a ""machisma"" one, and that will suit many viewers fine. But if you are remotely interested in the science fiction aspects, or even the terror of the first movie (which was truly terrifying), you might be disappointed to find you are continually battered instead. It's great battering, but if you actually listen to the dialog (when there is any--the best parts of the movie are merely sounds), you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>James Cameron, the director here (and not the director of the first one, which is credited to the more original Ridley Scott), does the famous Cameron thing, playing a kind of ""Star Wars"" game of making an epic suited for about a 17 year old. Not that older people (and younger) can't enjoy it, but movies have their target points, and that's it here. You can see it in the dialog and plot, of course, but also in the overall feel of things, which is a combination of early computer games (1986 is a long time ago in those terms) and swashbuckler classics. It's a vivid, fast movie.<br/><br/>You will notice, in retrospect, some ""Avatar"" features that are interesting, beyond just Sigourney Weaver. Foremost, this is a military affair, very right wing, go-get-em stuff, but with the admirable (American) rise of the individual above the chaos of both internal logistics and the logic of the evil outer world.<br/><br/>The monster? Monstrous. The famous designer H.H. Giger is not involved here except by carryover from the first. It's a good thing he was the originator because the basic visual and sculptural quality of the monster, the planet, the ships, and the sets, is under Giger's brilliant sway, and is a defining quality of the film. It makes no biologic or engineering sense, but so what? It looks great.<br/><br/>In all, clearly, there are amazing things here, taken on their own level. But there are discouraging ones, too, for those who are willing to pay attention. The little blonde girl at one point says, ""Mommy...I mean Ripley, I'm scared."" And Ripley (Weaver) says, ""I know, Honey. Me, too."" That's the core of it all. Don't forget your grenade launcher."
"dee.reid","10","5","7","15 October 2001"," Believe the hype, it's a classic.
","Aliens is in fact one of my favorite science-fiction films. I also find it hard to believe that I was also only a year old when this movie came out and strangely enough, the special effects have held up quite well since 1986.<br/><br/>As many of you already know, Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of the first encounter with the deadly alien. Ripley(Sigourney Weaver) is floating through space in hypersleep. Her escape pod is picked up by a deep-space salvage crew. She wakes up in a hospital where she meets Carter Burke(played with the right amount distrustworthiness by Paul Reiser) who informs Ripley about how long she has been floating in space. He also tells her that the Yutani Corporation has funded colonization of LV-426, the planet that the Nostromo(the ship from the first Alien film) landed on. Burke later shows up at Ripley's room with Lt. Gorman(William Hope) and tells her that contact has been lost with LV-426. Ripley tells them that it was the aliens had probably gotten the colonists. As her nightmares continue, she becomes convinced that the only way to end her nightmares is to go to the planet and see that the creatures are eliminated. So she goes. We next see her on the military ship, The Sulaco. She sees that many of the marines are very confident that they will succeed in their mission of exterminating the aliens. The marines include Hicks(Michael Biehn), Hudson(Bill Paxton), Vasquez(Jenette Goldstein), Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews), Drake(Mark Rolston), and an android(Lance Henriksen). They go to the planet and Ripley becomes a sort of surrogate mother to a lonely and terrified little girl named Newt(Carrie Henn). Newt tells that the aliens were in fact responsible for the disappearance of the colonists. Soon after, all hell breaks loose as each marine is picked off in the alien hive, thus leaving a only a small group of survivors.<br/><br/>Aliens is probably one of the best movies to come during the eighties. Sigourney Weaver deserved the Oscar for best actress. The supporting performances are great also especially Bill Paxton who plays the frightened Hudson. He is probably my favorite character in the movie. Special praise should go to director James Cameron for keeping the action slick and the tension always mounting. I also think it was pretty clever with the film editing that made it look like that hundreds of aliens were all over the place when in actuality only six costumes were used. That's pretty tight.<br/><br/>One gripe that I do have with the Alien films in general, are the aliens themselves which I think, are the most overlooked part of these movies. The aliens are the heart and soul of these films, but come off most of the time as just a really cool looking special effect. I'm not saying that's bad but come on the films should at least go into a little depth as to explaining what they are or where they came from. I mean, I wish a fifth alien movie or a documentary would be made that would go into depth to explain what they are or something like that.<br/><br/>I have been a big fan of the alien series ever since I saw this movie. I even used to collect the Alien action figures that were popular from around like 1993-1995. Surprise, surprise, I still have them, most of which are still in good condition with the exception of about two or three. I'm just saying that to show you how big a fan of Aliens I am.<br/><br/>Now about the other films in the series. In my opinion, Alien(1979) is probably the most overrated film in the series. Don't me wrong I liked the first film, it's just that it seems a bit dated and director Ridley Scott has made many better films since then. Alien 3(1992) has been unfairly judged as being the worst in the series. I think that happened because director David Fincher(Seven, Fight Club, The Game) was trying something new with the series and got badly criticized for it. Alien: Resurrection(1997) was directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who by the way is a visual genius. Before Resurrection came out, me and my best friend would get into arguments of whether or not Resurrection would actually surpass Aliens. To our surprise, it did surpass it as far as special effects went but, we were a little disappointed with the film's story. But it's a real shame though, that Alien: Resurrection is an even more underrated movie than Alien 3.<br/><br/>Aliens gets an 10/10"
"Xophianic","9","9","15","1 February 2000"," The ultimate proof that a sequel can be better than the original
","I do not believe the theory that all originals are better than their sequels, end of story. I think most originals are better, but any time I think of a sequel that is better than the original, two movies come to mind. One of them is Terminator 2.<br/><br/>The other is Aliens. Aliens is by far, the best in the series of four ""Alien"" movies, and one of the greatest action/sci-fi movies of all time. As much as I enjoyed Alien, I believe that Aliens was better in many many ways.<br/><br/>One of which are, of course, character development. Ripley is a much more interesting character in this movie than she was in the first one. You can see her determination in every move she makes. (I also recommend seeing the special edition, which has additional scenes within them. You get more of a feel for Ripley's character when you know more about her daughter.) I think the marines are extremely cool. I think Hudson is the most interesting character of all.  Gorman is very interesting too. You watch him turn from a cowardly pathetic loser to an actual brave soldier. Burke, who tried to betray the group for money, is also a great villain.<br/><br/>The aliens themselves are much cooler. Now you can see that they aren't just brainless animals who do nothing but kill. They are actually very smart animals who do nothing but kill. In Alien there was only one, so you didn't get to see how well they work in packs, lead people into traps, guard the Queen or cut the power before going into battle. And of course, since there are more aliens that means more of them can be killed, which means more carnage and more excitement. (This also applies to the human characters).<br/><br/>There is never a dull moment in Aliens. I love watching it over and over, it never gets boring."
"g-bodyl","10","8","13","30 December 2008"," Another Sci-Fi Classic!
","I was impressed at the original Aliens. There is no words to describe how much better this film is. Everything is nearly perfect with this film especially the aliens and the horror scenes.<br/><br/>To see this movie, I recommend that you watch the the 1979 version first because the plot is a direct continuation of that movie. In Aliens, Ripley has been in hypersleep for 57 years. She is upset that her daughter is gone and even more because no one believes her tale. But, the company sends her with Marines to figure out what happened to the colonists on the original planet Ripley was on 57 years before. The plot and the characters will keep you in suspense.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch. Almost every actor gave excellent performances. Signourey Weaver still is powerful playing Ripley. I was impressed with Carrie Henn as she plays a girl that survived the alien attacks on the colonists. Bill Paxton was decent even if he was a bit whiny.<br/><br/>The special effects and the action are great. The explosions are top-of-the-art(only for that time period). The visual effects are stunning. The action scenes are fun to watch. There is more action than the first film because we see that Ripley can kick some serious butt.<br/><br/>The music by James Horner adds spice to the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a perfect sci-fi/horror film. I rate this movie 10/10."
"TheDeadMayTasteBad","9","8","13","3 July 2008"," ""One of the Best Sequels Ever Made""...
","... and there's a reason the summary headline is in quotations-- it gets thrown around a lot when referring to this film. Rightfully so.<br/><br/>Perhaps what separates 'Aliens' from all of the other sequels that followed 1979s 'Alien' is that it has heart. Not only are we entrenched in the stark, gritty and imaginative future that Cameron has built for us- we are emotionally connected to it. And how's that so? Well, it is the product of much hard work and imagination. Whether you appreciate the sequel as much as the original or not, 'Alien' never attempts to copy or even ""outdo"" its predecessor. Instead, director James Cameron respects what Ridley Scott accomplished in the first film and takes it in a completely new direction while maintaining the dynamic presence of Weaver's Ripley as a key means of continuity.<br/><br/>The characters are the heart of the film and the unfamiliar world in 'Aliens'. We even become attached to a android (who would have suspected that, especially after 'Alien'?). In just a few scenes, there is more humanity established in Michael Biehn's Cpl. Dwayne Hicks than in any other buff and brawn character in the future sequels.<br/><br/>Another key factor to the films' greatness is its special effects, crafted by the (late, sadly) Stan Winston. I have a feeling that even years from now, moviegoers will still look back on this film as one of the greatest technical accomplishments in cinema's special effects history.<br/><br/>As a adolescent boy, 'Aliens' was my favorite entry into the series. It was full of testosterone, centered in atmosphere, and riddled with some of the most imaginative and coolest characters and creatures ever placed on film. It still remains a favorite to this day."
"mjw2305","10","8","13","15 January 2005"," Different from the Original (and one of the best sequels in existence)
","This time its James Cameron who is charged with bringing the alien to the screen, an entirely different approach is used and it has to be said that this sequel is not as scary as the original, however it is slightly better (probably because it was made 7 years later and visual effects were much improved).<br/><br/>This time we get to see the alien in all its glory and the frights are due to the sheer number of them terrorising the heavily armed soldiers intent on destroying them.<br/><br/>This is definitely less of a horror film and more of an action movie. I think the reason that it works so well is that everyone was is ready to see the aliens in all there terrifying splendour, and had the sequel tried to recreate the suspense of the original would undoubtedly have failed.<br/><br/>Sci-Fi action at it's very best 10/10"
"tomgillespie2002","9","6","9","29 August 2017"," One of cinema's greatest ever sequels
","The biggest obstacle faced by a studio looking to cash-in on a surprise success that resonated well with both audiences and critics is the direction in which to take it. The seemingly obvious call would be to study the original and pick apart the ingredients which helped form, in the case of Alien, an instant science-fiction classic. While the sequel faced trouble getting the greenlight as Fox procrastinated over a project they felt was a costly risk, this delay in production was only leading to the sequel rights falling into the hands of the perfect guy for the job. Production on The Terminator was facing a lengthy delay due to scheduling conflicts, so director James Cameron found himself some spare time to pen a script. Only this wasn't to be called Alien 2, but Aliens, as Cameron sought to embrace the scope and ambition he would later become famous for.<br/><br/>While Alien features gruff space truckers, Aliens is led by a band of buzz-cut space marines, and Cameron's idea was not to continue with the slow-burn, show-little approach of the original, but a relentless assault on the senses. It's certainly isn't that Cameron doesn't know how to generate tension (the slow beeping of the motion tracker and the moment trapped inside a room with a face-hugger is clear evidence that he does), but he has a different method of pay- off. A long build-up following by a genuinely terrifying jump-scare made you hold your breath in Alien, but when the indecipherable blobs turn into a huge hoard of the remorseless, slimy killing machine, it's difficult to catch it. It's incredibly long, with a climax that seems to go on forever. But Aliens truly puts you through the wringer, to the point that, by the end, you loathe the xenomorph just as much as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver).<br/><br/>After spending 57 years in stasis, Ripley is picked up and rescued by her employers the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the very company that sent the crew of the Nostromo to their doom. Her wild claims of a perfect alien hunter are dismissed, mainly because the planet it was originally discovered on was colonised years ago, and her flight officer license is revoked. When communication with the colony is inevitably lost, shifty company representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) convinces Ripley to join an expedition back to the alien planet to investigate and exterminate any alien lifeforms discovered. She reluctantly agrees, and finds herself on a mission accompanied by a rag-tag squad of marines, who all seem trigger- happy but incredibly naive about the dangers they will face. When they arrive, the only survivor is a little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), who speaks of monsters who mostly come out at night... mostly.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is so terrific in this film that she received Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, something almost unheard of in the sci-fi/horror genre. Having learned that her daughter had died of old age just two years before she was rescued, her relationship with Newt and her eventual showdown with the alien queen is given a whole new layer. She is backed up by a supporting cast who help distinguish themselves in the platoon of grunts, with special mention going to Michael Biehn, Jenette Goldstein and, of course, the late Bill Paxton. They help elevate the film from an exciting sea of bullets and spattered alien carcasses to an engrossing thriller featuring characters you genuinely hope will make it out alive. Of course, they all don't, but Cameron makes almost every death memorable and occasionally oddly powerful. I still prefer the quiet horror of Alien, but I can completely understand why many prefer the deafening terror of Cameron's vision, but it can quite rightly take its place among cinema's greatest ever sequels."
"spencergrande6","10","6","9","27 July 2017"," This film just works, like the first one does, it's as simple as that
","This film just works, like the first one does, it's as simple as that. Cameron found a way to preserve the spirit of the original while taking it in a new direction and expanding on its characters and universe in what feels like an effortless and wholly inevitable follow up to the original classic - he knew the same old shtick just wouldn't cut it this time around.<br/><br/>So instead the film jumps genre - a lot of people regard this as an action movie though I think they're off by one. This is an action- thriller, or an action-suspense movie. The scenes of gun shooting and alien running and jumping is played first as suspense, and then as thriller, wrapped in an ostensible action package. It's more like trying to fight back against the invincible boogeyman than it is just mowing down hordes of faceless baddies.<br/><br/>The special effects by Stan Winston are out of this world. Maybe the best mechanical and miniatures of the entire series (it's ironic that the parts that aged the worst are the old CGI). The Queen and her egg laying is just as gnarly as ever. The Alien slowly rising out of the water behind Newt is an all-time iconic shot.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is never better than in this film. She's given just a bit more characterization this time around, involving the subtext of mothers and daughters, but it never overtakes the story and most of its emotion is brought through in her performance. There's a shot of her smoking a cigarette near the beginning, with a long untapped piece of ash hanging from it, that says everything just from the way she holds herself. She has to go back and fight, there's nothing left for her in the ""real"" world. She takes what she learned in the original and here becomes an ultimate badass heroine for the ages.<br/><br/>This is a prototypical Cameron movie. I'm not sure how he does it but he takes seemingly simple plots and characterizations and makes them fresh, exciting, thrilling, and acceptable to the audience, while honoring the pacing and rhythms without flourishes or indulgence and still manages runtimes in excess of 2 hours. The 2 1/2 hour director's cut here is superior in every way, and it doesn't even feel longer."
"ttapola","10","6","9","11 August 2010"," From #71 to #54 in Four Years
","I thought it would be appropriate if my 100th review was of my favorite movie ever. Since I actually wrote a 20th Anniversary review that was published elsewhere in 2006, I decided to polish that one a little. Also, I noticed something that tells *a lot* about the timelessness of this classic. In 2006, I noted down that ALIENS was at #71 in the IMDb Top 250. What a delight it is to see it (almost) four years later at #54. Now how many movies do go up in the Top 250? Not many. Curiously, it just happens that of those that do, many are also some of my personal favorites: for example, in *just* the last 15 months, Terminator 2 has risen from #61 to #42. And in the last three years, Terminator has managed an astonishing rise from #201 to #158. That's *43* notches! Both are James Cameron movies. Does Avatar have something to do with this? Probably, but I just suspect it made a new generation discover these timeless classics. These movies just don't age.<br/><br/>But I digress. Not only is ALIENS a universally recognized classic and arguably the best sequel of all time (with the possible exceptions of The Godfather: Part II, Star Wars: Episode V – The Empire Strikes back and The Dark Knight), its influence has been more widely spread than most may realize. Yes, this is probably mentioned in every other review, but it is such an important entry in the annals of Hollywood that *not* mentioning it would risk spreading ignorance. And ignorance of the chain of events in cinema history leads to the youth holding such drivel as The Twilight ""Saga"" (more like a toxic stream) above gems such as ALIENS.<br/><br/>In Alien, Ripley became the sole survivor, but it was not until ALIENS that she'd become *a warrior*. The commercial success of ALIENS meant not only countless copy-cat movies, but also that the decision-makers realized that females could be heroes as well. This paved way to Xena (1995), Buffy (1997), Alias (2001) and many others.<br/><br/>It is also notable how well ALIENS has aged: it is still as effective as when it premiered, mostly thanks to James Camerons perfectionism and innovativeness: if the technology for something he wanted did not exist, he'd invent it. Avatar proved he's also still *the best* director of heart-pounding action in the world: the way Aliens nails you to your seat when it gets going is matched only by Cameron's work in the Terminator movies. EMPIRE (UK) called ALIENS ""the most exciting movie ever"" and I dare you to counter that. They also managed to condense the essence of ALIENS in one hair-raising expression: ""Oxygen-stifling"". That's what I tried 20 years to come up with. That expression just nails it. There's an agonizingly tense build-up and when the s#it hits the fan you are almost unable to breath.<br/><br/>And if you want subtext, ALIENS has it (and you've probably read these also countless times, but I want to be thorough here): besides feminist views, the movie is also a clever allegory of the Vietnam war: the military might of America is overcome by the ""inferior"" enemy. ""They're (only) animals!"" screams a distressed Hudson (Bill Paxton in his best role ever). It also paints a never more relevant, highly alarming picture of the way huge multi-national corporations put profit above all else. And then there are the things that you probably don't notice, the subtle tricks like the scene where the Space Marines wake up from their cryogenic sleep and gather for a meal. In a *very* short span of time we get what is known as a textbook example of *brilliant* script-writing (ask any award-winning scriptwriter and he concurs): with minimalist strokes, characters are painted into fully realized personas - you *feel* that these characters are flesh and bone (exept for Bishop), not flat card-board cut-outs.<br/><br/>Of course I am biased, but try as a might, I cannot fault ALIENS. There's practically *everything* you could hope for: great characters, THE Most Scary Monster Ever (The Alien Queen), immortal dialog, action, suspense, plot twists, romance, bravura editing, a damn fine score (James Horner's music from ALIENS has been re-used in countless movie trailers) and even a cute kid that's *not* annoying! The Director's Cut even takes care of the (few) plot holes in the theatrical release. Final judgment: absolutely essential viewing for *everyone*. Best. Movie. Ever."

"zetes","10","6","9","6 April 2000"," Probably the best action film ever made, and one of the best sci-fi films
","This is James Cameron's best film. He used to be an action auteur (but I think he threw that completely away with Titanic). Aliens is a masterpiece of thrills. The set is so claustrophobic, it makes me shiver just thinking about it. <br/><br/>The reason that this movie becomes so great, though, is the mother/daughter relationship between Ripley and Newt. This is such a realistic relationship. And the actress who plays Newt was one great child actor, every bit as good as Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense. Like I said in my review of Alien, Ripley is a great character played by Sigourney Weaver, a great actress. Her suffering becomes ours. Also, notice how every scene takes place from her point of view. In the special addition DVD, though, there is a scene added where we see the colony (actually, Newt's father) find the aliens. This is used to introduce the colony's situation and to introduce Newt, but it was an enormous mistake to reinsert this scene back into the film. It breaks the rhythym quite terribly. It is a particularly long and clunky scene in the first place. It was enough when Paul Reiser told us that there has been a colony on that asteroid for many years. The audience knows right away that something is going to happen there with the aliens which will make Ripley have to go there. Now, with this scene having been reinserted, when the soldiers enter the colony and find a single life-form moving around, we know it is Newt (since that first scene kept focusing in on her). There is no surprise as their used to be. It should have just been left as a supplemental scene. Bad, bad mistake. <br/><br/>Of course, that scene could not ruin this great film. Only really perceptive people who have a huge understanding of the language of film will ever notice it. But those of you who read this review, pay attention to that scene. I give this film a 10/10 because originally Cameron was smart enough to take that scene out. He must have reinserted it after he made Titanic."

She reluctantly agrees, and they travel to the planet where they come into contact with not just one...but several...aliens.<br/><br/>James Cameron (""Titanic"") directed this magnificent science-fiction horror film, one of the best sequels ever made in any genre.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","7","11","22 April 2008"," In my opinion, by far the best of the series
","One of the problems of these is that each director, albeit to varying degrees, were selfish... not only adding their respective styles and touches to their separate efforts, each also tried to make theirs the definite piece(and little was left for the next director to work with). I won't claim that Cameron wasn't, as well... nor for a second deny that he by far had the best starting place(you'll know what I mean if you've watched the first, and perhaps also this... and if you haven't, you shouldn't find out from any other source)... but darn it if he doesn't live up to it and deliver the goods(not everyone manages to, no matter how solid the hand they're dealt is). Where the first has adequate atmosphere, this has it in spades. It had maybe three or four jump scares, this is continually exciting(this actually affected me far more often, and typically more lasting). This also has humor. It looks magnificent, technically and visually speaking. I'm afraid I just cannot claim that I see how Alien measures up to this. Effects are superior(how much better could they really have gotten in seven years? Besides, if you can't get something to look convincing on the screen, why are you putting it up there?). Characters are interesting and strong. The action is awesome, some of the best for the genres(I'm not kiddin'). Direction is effective all the way, and James just gets something much more satisfying, entertaining and engaging out of the title creature. This takes the next logical step in the franchise, and does so almost flawlessly. The plot is marvelous. Pacing is excellent, this is never boring(neither version). Acting is about spot-on(and frankly much more involving and involved than that of its predecessor, with Weaver, Henriksen(nailing his performance unbelievably well), Biehn(by far one of my favorite male actors, and when James Cameron directs him, it gets kicked up a notch of considerable size) and Henn(9 years old, and so talented) being just the top picks in a film which seems devoid of poor performances. Paxton provides perfect comic relief, without being goofy or lame. The sci-fi aspects of the film are also amazing(not to ignore what Alien did have, which should also be noted), and everything about the Marines is great, cool and obviously very thought through. The Special Edition holds about 17 minutes more material, and it's invariably worth the extra time. That cut also has a commentary track, and it is rather good... Bill and Michael are so fun to listen to, and their camaraderie comes off so genuine(though they do also all partake in the, one would presume, mandatory love-fest), Gale, Stan Winston and James have quite a bit to say... even Carrie, if she doesn't throw her two cents in as much, is a pleasant inclusion. All in all, the best of the series, and definitely the most intense(and perhaps scary) of them. I recommend it to fans of Cameron and/or of the Alien series. 8/10"

Unless you're really young, you have missed the best movie ever made in entertainment history. I really hope that one has'nt been unlucky enough to have seen Alien-3, Alien resurrection or God forbid, AVP, before actually having seen Alien and Aliens for the first time. To maximize your enjoyment and understanding of Aliens, watch Alien-1 first and then go buy a home theater or locate a cinema hall where this is running and then only see it.

"iSkyWalKing","1","36","79","7 April 2017"," Unpopular opinion...
","Words cannot describe just how much I hate this piece of s*%t ""sequel"" to one of the greatest films of all time. This film breaks every single one of my personal cardinal rules for what makes a great film, so I'll begin my rant...<br/><br/>Right from the get-go it is evident that James Cameron's intent is on taking the subtleties and ATMOSPHERE of the first film (2 things that made the original so amazing) and turn it on it's head. Every single cliché you can possibly muster up is used in this filth...sorry, I meant 'film'. Melodramatic and extremely over the top dialogue, scenarios and acting all rolled in one.<br/><br/>So within the first 15 minutes (with zero build up or development) Ripley is back, & has a DEEP understanding of the Aliens miraculously (as if her situation in the original has turned her into an expert on these Aliens all of a sudden.) They also now have boat loads of crews on the planet with the ship & have colonized it. Of course the people on site consist of all kinds of jokers and utter morons and...um, children?! OK, I guess because ""families""...or whatever. Moving along... There is absolutely no suspense or build up in any way shape or form, like the original brilliantly had. Now they are seemingly surrounded by HUNDREDS of Aliens and the stupidity begins to overlap one another. Over the top performances by EVERYONE, absolutely cringe worthy dialogue and 'humor' and wise-cracks...<br/><br/>In one scene a crowd is standing and staring at an object barrelling towards them with plenty of time to move yet they all stand and stare, until good old Ripley notified everyone to ""RUUUUUN"". Because apparently seeing the object coming towards them wasn't enough to garner a reaction, but our Alien expert hero telling them not to get hit by on-coming traffic seemed to do the trick. In another scene during a 'gun fight' with the Aliens, one super duper bad-ass commando doesn't just shoot an Alien in the face, he manages to have just enough time to stick the barrel in the Aliens face, have the Alien not react for a few seconds so the totally bad-ass commando looking dude could say ""EAT THIS"", before he pulled the trigger. Super duper gnarly. Rock on bro's...kick-ass..USA USA...<br/><br/>Then we have the old ""innocent child"" caught up in the midst of this Alien war trick. ""Oh what-ever will they do? I hope this object...I mean child placed in this film to supposedly tug on my heart strings makes it out of all this alive. Oh that poor poor innocent child, she doesn't deserve this. Welp!!"" I'm on the edge of my seat at this point. Oh James Cameron you genius you. SOMEONE PLEEEASE think of the CHILDREN. Someone MUST save the girl, first and foremost. That is the mission now for our hero...... *eyes roll a full 360 in my head at this point*. The little girls screaming got so irritating I wanted nothing more than her to die. There...I said it.<br/><br/>Why are the Aliens so stationary and dumb in this film? Why are there so many of them all of a sudden? They just keep bee-lining towards bullets and getting swatted around like flies. Just utter non-sense all around with this over-long piece of s*%t sequel. The music/score is atrocious with cliché symphonies that you hear in every sh*%ty Spielberg or Michael Bay film (to this very day unfortunately) where-as the original had a very unique, dark and mysterious overall score that only added to the amazing atmospheric scenes.<br/><br/>This sequel is everything I hate about Hollywood. Everything I hate about big Blockbuster films...as we are currently experiencing today with super-hero films for example. Just boring repetitive dumbed down utter trash being passed as 'great cinema'. There are too many negatives I can point out about this film, but I think I've made my point. The original Alien, Ridley Scott's Alien is one of the greatest films of all time, Aliens is in my opinion, one of the worst & most boring films I have ever seen. It absolutely blows."

","Anticipating the release of Prometheus, I decided to watch some of the alien movies again to refresh my memory, specially after I learned that the story would include the mysterious alien figure known as the ""Space Jockey"". Watching Ridley Scott's movie went just as expected, I continue to see it as one of the best sci-fi movies ever produced. The next day was James Cameron day and it struck me that there was a time when I considered Aliens to be a good movie, but now I find it just terrible. It rivals ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" as one of the worst sequels of all time.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers for ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" from here on *** I'll just comment on some of the major points that made me reevaluate my position.<br/><br/>1.) The science: the Alien movies are not usually remembered by their scientific accuracy, nevertheless the few points that are made in that sense in the first movie are credible enough, and the lack of any further elaboration on controversial topics leaves the viewer free to interpret it in a convincing way. For instance we are told that Nostromo's voyage is interrupted when they are still months from reaching Earth, but it could be ship's time (see relativity). There is no communication with Earth, as one would expect if they were at a different stellar system. The fact that nobody mentions any family relation contributes to the view that work in space involves being away for long periods of time. But all that is destroyed by ""Aliens"" when out of the blue we learn that Ripley has a daughter, who is now dead, and that Ripley planned to be home for her 11th birthday. Aliens is full of scientific illiteracy like the fusion reactor that blows up if not cooled just like a fission reactor, and the orbiting spacecraft that just falls to ground when released by another orbiting spacecraft.<br/><br/>2.) Stupid military force: this is the element that proves the complete change of direction that the movie had taken. From sci-fi horror to almost a slap-stick comedy. An elite unit that resembles a bunch of teenagers going to a party, an irresponsible and inexperienced lieutenant that freaks out when half his crew dies, and a hysterical soldier that punctuates every sentence with ""man"".<br/><br/>3.) ""They are on the ceiling!"": in a highly sophisticated structure built in a hostile environment there is always room for the silliest plot device in the movie. While barricading themselves in the control room they forgot that the ceiling was completely open, even after Ripley specifically tells them to check every ventilation access, electrical tube, etc. That was the smartest thing they could think of to kill some more characters and keep them running?<br/><br/>To wrap it all up there is a reprise of the last act of the first movie, with the alien queen sneaking into the ship and being blown away through the airlock, intertwined with a pathetic mechanical suit fight and the worst line in the whole script: ""Leave her alone, you bitch!"""

","There are only a few sequels superior to the first instalment and Aliens it's one of them with Terminator 2 and The Godfather 2.
Aliens is also on my top 3 favorite movies of all time. And trust me, probably I've watched a thousand or more.
The movie is fantastic, includes the suspenseful atmosphere from the first one but adding raw brutal action and great interpretation from Ripley again. Also, the new DC version that I've watched today is far better than the old one. Hopefully, one day someone can invent something as great as Aliens. But today, I've watched and enjoyed again. It never gets old."

","WOW!!!Is this the best action sci-fi movie ever?Well yeah along with Predator and the first two terminators.This is a movie which gets better with each viewing.James Cameron manages to top the 1979 classic and this fact alone makes this film amazing.This time it's war and Ripley must fight her greatest fear once again but this time with the help of a kick ass marine squad.But what they find on LV-426 will send them to hell and back.And what a wild ride it is.Everything here is perfect.There isn't a single weak character here.My two most favorites are private Hudson(played by Bill Paxton)-total badass and corporal Hicks(Michael Biehn)the natural born leader.The film has excellent sets,kick ass action,quite a lot of chills,great humor and a perfect music score.Jenette Goldstein is absolutely hot in this role.Her macho chick Vasquez is awesome and hardcore.And the aliens here are frightening to the max.You never know when they'll show up.James Cameron makes these beasties more frightening than they ever were.They are smart enough to cut the power and use a specific fighting strategy when attacking.Stan Winston creates his masterpiece at the time-the Alien Queen.This thing is more evil and vicious than all the aliens combined!!!And when she rips Bishop in two it's freakin brutal.The final fight between Her and Ripley in the power loader is history in the making.I would like to conclude with the statement that this is a perfect movie and in my top 10 of all time.Along with Predator the best in the Alien/Predator franchise."
"ignacio-mig14","1","35","79","23 August 2012"," Hey Jim, what have you done to my Ripley???
","I usually like James Cameron movies, more than any Scorsese or Spielberg's actually, but this sequel just hurts me real bad. In Ridley Scott's movie, Ripley was a sexy heroine fighting with no massive weapons, who didn't cry for dead daughters or any of those dumb sentimental clichés that most people love but I don't. She was alone and fought. Even her ship partners didn't care for her. She was a horror survivor. Well, for Mr. Cameron that was all wrong. He thought Scott was portraying Ripley as a heartless and useless person, I assume, so he equipped her with the biggest machine gun out there packed with infinite ammo, so violence lovers can drool just staring at it and she only had to shoot, and he added a little girl to replace a coming-out-of-nowhere-dead-daughter (Bravo!), and wants me to cheer for the girl, cry for the girl, and love the girl while she screams like being possessed by a really high-pitched voice demon. Terrific. Well, I didn't do any of that. Instead I've started to hate her and the movie, and that's what I'm still doing. Along with the little girl, Cameron wants me to cheer for more cute people: the U.S. Army. Cool, let's say some people were living on the dead planet, so we send the Army in order to save them and save the day again for the country. Well, I'm not American, so I can't have any good feelings about their Army, I'm sorry. I'd rather watch ""Avatar"" anytime, at least Jim wants me to cheer for the right people on that one. Finally, while the Alien in Scott's 1979 masterpiece was a force of nature that nobody could kill, here Cameron introduce us a bunch of useless bugs that can be killed easier than an ant, just for the sake of appreciate all the weaponry and all the shooting. For that I'd rather watch Terminator. I find this sequel appalling, it destroyed the planet built by Mr. Scott, flooding it with the more basic clichés a movie can have. I hate this movie and specially the annoying little girl. Oh, and the end... a shameless rip-off. 1/10 because there's no 0/10."
"ddfcmp8","1","50","123","7 June 2006"," Not even half of the first one.
","I'm sorry to disagree with about 90% of this website, but I did not find this sequel to be anything but a rehash of the first. Not only is it a rehash, but it also brought to life, some of the really dumb stereotypes that exist in movies today. Crummy dialog that is fixed to sound 'cool' and 'awesome' or 'in with the times' and you know what? It isn't. Now, before you dismiss the rest of my review, I want to add that I tried to like this film. For a long while I tried to find some cool ways to see it, and you know what? I thought I had for a while. But you know, the thing s that so many people hold it up higher than the first, and I just can't see why. I guess I would be more open to give it a second chance, but people keep saying it is better than the first, and I just don't agree. I think the opening was alright, until the shock sequence when...uh-oh! She might have something in her stomach and.....oh, just a dream. HOW CHEAP! Why would they even rely that much on the first? Especially since it had been a good 6 or 7 years already? Jeez! I just thought that was mistake #1. Next, the film was quite intriguing, but that was because they discussed the originals damages. I just can't say when I lost it. Most of Sigourney's dialog was pretty awesome, and of course, Sigourney was GREAT. I'll give it that, but the rest, it just seems to imposed and buffed, and for what? It just crashes into all the rocks on LV-426.-Oops! There's another problem right there! They just HAVE to bring us to the scene of the crime, and...57 years later! UGH! Why not have the original beast find it's way to earth? Why not make a new type of disaster happen? Taking back to the original scene of the crime was unnecessary! My final word is that this film needn't have been made, but it was, and I watched, actually thinking it would be good. It could have, and should have been, but I just don't think it was. How do you follow the act of the original Ridley Scott classic? You don't! Sorry."

","Unlike Ridley Scott's beautifully directed original, Aliens suffers from the classic James Cameron heavy handedness. Cameron, like Lucas, clearly is a believer that more is more. Where one Alien was enough for the original, a hundred are now necessary. Ridley Scott created an original where the viewer felt for the main character, she was lonely and scared and up against a terrible lurking creature that was terrifying because it was unknown and mysterious. The tag line was even ""in space no one can hear you scream,"" which really captures the essence of what made the original work. So for the sequel James Cameron brought us a group of unprofessional marines with comically impractical uniforms and equipment and plenty of ammunition and set them up against wave after wave of aliens. How could it possibly be functional to have so much equipment hanging off of you and sticking out all over the place to get snagged on anything you walk past? The fear factor of the alien is diminished with numbers, Cameron transformed the story line from horror to standard shoot em up, arcade style action. Aliens pop up just to get shot down just like in a video game. The dialog is terrible, Bill Paxton gave his worst acting job of his career (which is saying something cause he's no Laurence Olivier). I feel that James Cameron and George Lucas fall into the same vein, they are so obsessed with what they can do they don't think about what the should do. They show absolutely no restraint because what drives the medium for them is special effects not story. Ridley Scott showed restraint, and his reward is that he directed one of the best sci-fi films of all time. Cameron on the other hand created an artistically devoid film with terrible acting, terrible dialog, where we don't care when characters die, and aliens are just popping out of the walls and ceiling to get shot down."
"rh86","10","7","12","18 November 2006"," The best sci fi/action ever made
","If Alien is the best sci fi horror ever made then Aliens is most definitely the best sci fi action ever made. James Cameron made sure that his film was a different movie from the first and succeeds greatly.<br/><br/>57 years after the end of Alien, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is found floating in space and bought back to earth where her story is greeted with disbelief and the planet where she met the Alien is now a colony. And this is just the fist ten minutes of the movie. Once contact is lost with the colony, the story ramps up a gear as Ripley accompanies a team of marines to the planet. Did, I say ramp up a gear, I mean goes into overdrive.<br/><br/>The suspense on arrival at the planet does well at building up the tension and also means that we get to actually know the characters, the incompetent lieutanent, Jeanette Goldstein's bad ass Private Vasquez, Bill Paxton's comic relief Hudson and Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks. And once the aliens attack we're treated to a non stop roller-coaster ride of a movie. There's also a good human storyline as Ripley take's charge of the only colonist remaining, eight year old Newt (Carrie Henn in her one and only role) while the marines are slowly picked off and Ripley is forced to confront her demons.<br/><br/>Despite being 20 years old now, this film still stands out. Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for her performance while the effects did win. Despite massive advances in CGI and effects since 1986, the effects in Aliens still stand up and actually work better. The Alien's aren't computers, they do exist even the monstrous Alien Queen, making for the mother of all show downs."

","""Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?"" – Pvt Hudson <br/><br/>The first ""Alien"" movie was essentially about a giant alien penis trying to impregnate a woman. Here, MOTHER (a spaceship's maternal computer) and ASH (the paternal cyborg) lovingly conspire to introduce a mysterious alien to the Nostromo, a commercial space-rig. The duo's plan is to have the alien impregnate the Nostromo's passengers, at which point the creature's seed can be safely transported back to earth, where it will be researched and developed into a biological weapon. The film ends with crew-mate Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) vulnerable and in her panties, having survived intergalactic rape and a Playboy magazine down the throat.<br/><br/>James Cameron's sequel, ""ALIENS"", likewise has ""feminist"" pretensions. Ripley is awakened from her suspended animation (the film is framed as a nightmarish dream), only to be blackmailed by corporate types (her future's ruling patriarchy) and coerced into returning to LV426, the planet where she first encountered the aliens. Once she arrives on planet, Ripley has to do three things: rescue and protect Newt (her surrogate daughter), fend off impregnation and destroy the Feminine Other (Alien Queen).<br/><br/>At first glance the film looks like a testosterone filled male action movie, but look closer and its clunky feminism is all over the place. All the males are either emasculated or ineffectual. Apone, the tough-as-nails Marine Captain, is wiped out in the first battle. Gorman, the Lieutenant, is useless and spends most of the movie unconscious. Hudson, despite his hilarious macho-ramblings, quickly reveals himself to be a giant cry-baby and Paul Reiser, the corporate weasel, is less representative of Hegemonic Masculinity than he is a snivelling coward. Even Bishop, the male cyborg, gets his crotch torn off. The most masculine marine is Vasquez, a tough Mexican woman who has bigger guns than any other marine. The only male character given sympathy is Hicks (Michael Biehn), but even he ends up taking orders from Ripley.<br/><br/>While the first film portrayed Ripley as a damsel in distress, Cameron portrays her as a tough warrior, albeit maternal enough to care for her surrogate child. She kicks butt, but smiles romantically when Hicks gives her a bracelet. It's your classic Warrior/Goddess dichotomy.<br/><br/>But feminism through a male's eyes isn't feminism at all. That Ripley has to battle at all means that conflict exists where none should. Though Cameron no doubt sees his finale as a giant intergalactic cat fight, two women facing off to defend their offspring in a man-less world, the Alien Mother represents a very masculine feminism; one based solely on reproduction and violent protection of its young.<br/><br/>H R Geiger, the designer of the original alien, has described his art as being about the ""fear of messy sexuality"". No surprise then that the ""Alien franchise"" is awash with tiny men walking down vaginal tunnels, periodically attacked by face huggers (flying uteruses) and phallic aliens. But what we have with the Alien Queen is a fear of the Feminine. Fear and awe of the vagina and repulsion toward reproduction.<br/><br/>In the film's final battle, Ripley is forced to take a stand against that in which, for most women, lay their power: procreation. Her main goal is to prevent impregnation, for her and for Newt. In this regard, she must fight against the essential state of the female, motherhood. And so once again, Ripley is asked to turn away from the feminine, to deny another aspect of herself that both she and the Alien Mother share. The hidden ideology of the film, the rejection of the feminine, is apparent once again.<br/><br/>The irony of the final battle is that for Ripley to conquer the Feminine she must master technology (guns, elevators, power loaders etc). Both films are guilty of perpetuating the notion of technology being chiefly male in origin (phallic weaponry and spacecraft) whereas biological processes are the domain of the female. Watch how the marines snicker when Ripley reveals her adeptness with a power loader, or when Hudson mocks Vasquez for carrying a gun. Women apparently are not supposed to be able to operate heavy machinery. Even hundreds of years into the future, technology is still the realm of the male. ""Woman-as-tool-user"" is still considered anomalous.<br/><br/>This dichotomy goes all the way back to Descartes' notion of objectivity in which men, with so-called ""rational"" minds, in order to discuss the natural world, were bound to think of themselves as ""outside"" the realm of the physical. This placed rational thought in the same realm as the masculine and the irrational with the feminine.<br/><br/>The film's attitude toward the Alien Mother shows how pervasive the rational male/irrational female dichotomy has been since the Scientific Revolution. The Alien Mother can be thought of as nature ""unhinged"" and out of control, akin to how Francis Bacon depicted nature and the natural world in his writings. Bacon believed that, outside of a strong masculinizing influence, Nature tends toward Chaos and the creation of violent monstrosities. The Alien Mother embodies this feminized ""state"" of nature, a ""state"" which the new, macho-Ripley must herself renounce.<br/><br/>So while, with its Vietnam overtones, ""Aliens"" is unconsciously part of the ""war-as-destruction-of-the-feminine"" trend of the 80s (Casualties of War, Heaven and Earth etc), portraying the Feminine as the debased victim of incompetent male oafs, it also has a more dubious underside. Indeed, Bacon's outlook, along with Descartes', became both a mainstay in the development of scientific thought in the 17th Century and in the establishment of a biological rationale for gender bias and sexism that continues to this day.<br/><br/>8.9/10 – Influenced by Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" (and a shameless rip off of ""Them!"", of which it even borrows its entire climax), ""Aliens"" is the perfect action film for a certain demographic. With its brilliant use of solid effects, rear screen projection and an unforgettable final duel, the film wows us with its relentless hardware and technique."

","There are very few sequels out there that have managed to surpass the originals and overcome the expectations of the first chapter's loyal & faithful fans. And James Cameron's Aliens is one film that accomplishes exactly that by taking the universe of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to, for this second chapter is much bigger & more action-packed than its predecessor, and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but as a redefinition of action filmmaking as well.<br/><br/>The story of Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of the first film & concerns the solo survivor Ripley, whose account of what happened on the planet is dismissed by her executives as the very desolate planet is now inhabited by humans. Things are set in motion when the contact with the planet is lost & Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate, which she refuses at first but joins in eventually in order to face & overcome her fears once n for all.<br/><br/>Written & directed by James Cameron, it's so heartwarming to see him expanding the universe of the previous film instead of crafting a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the same concept of the first film. Cameron in my opinion is an extremely talented filmmaker not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. And this film is a perfect testament to that.<br/><br/>While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens replaces the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species. And even though there is less suspense in this film than the last chapter, Cameron makes up for it by turning his feature into an action- thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror & highly potent combat sequences which ultimately culminates with a bone- chilling climax, that is executed to perfection.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, while Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. And Cameron has penned down her character with extreme care by providing Ripley more depth & emotional dimensions to explore, which Weaver makes full use of to deliver a career-best performance while also becoming the first real female action figure in cinema.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is no slouch either as just like the previous film, there are almost no death fodders in this and the space marines are one bunch of badass characters, each nicely written & given a distinct personality. As for its technical achievements, the art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. Visual Effects however is groundbreaking, sound is expertly carried out and James Horner's score perfectly balances the tone of the film throughout the runtime.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, James Cameron's Aliens is a wildly entertaining, immensely satisfying & one spectacular roller-coaster ride of non- stop action that refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action extravaganzas ever made. Arguably the best film of the franchise, certainly one of the greatest sequels of all time, and undoubtedly one of the finest & most influential examples of its genre(s), Aliens is a perfect follow-up to Alien and, just like its predecessor, is immortal for its contribution to cinema."
"Andy44","2","34","85","13 March 2005"," Really not much point
","Alien was a classic; this sequel is flashy junk.<br/><br/>In Alien we saw ordinary people dealing with something unimaginable. We were shown their cooperation and conflict. The drastic isolation was overpowering. The technological twists were plausible. The scenes of ""discovering"" the alien were fantastic but natural.<br/><br/>So, instead of a sequel that might involve some scientific inquiry or perhaps some narrative worthy of the cosmic ideas involved, we get: sweating warriors yelling at each other; a little girl survivor; Ripley grim and determined; hordes of monsters; a sneaky slimeball; lots of noise and Saturday afternoon serial ""suspence""<br/><br/>This script is about as creative as a 13 year-old's fantasy. Actually I think a lot of 13 year-olds could have done better.<br/><br/>Unless a sequel really honors the original, it's just parasitic."
"sddavis63","3","14","30","21 February 2011"," Ridley Scott's Directing Was Missed
","Right off the top the movie made me shake my head with one of those ""it's just too convenient"" moments. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) - the only survivor from the first movie - is finally rescued by a salvage ship after being in ""hyper-sleep"" for 57 years. OK. She tries to brief the company that sent her and her team on the first mission on the dangerous aliens they encountered, but no one will believe her story. Why not? Because there have been human colonists on the planet now for over 20 years and there hasn't been a single report of a problem. Well, we know where this is headed, don't we. Now that Ripley's back all of a sudden contact with the colony is lost, which allows the company to send Ripley back to the planet to do battle with the aliens all over again. Apparently they were waiting for her to be found!<br/><br/>Setting aside that moment of ultra-convenience, this movie is weaker than the original in the series. James Cameron took over the directing duties in this from Ridley Scott, and Scott's touch was missed. What made the first movie very effective was the shadowy nature of the aliens. Scott never really gave us a good look at them. They were shadowy figures which made the story quite suspenseful. Cameron dispenses with that idea completely. The aliens are front and centre once the team reaches the planet, and somehow that makes this movie less frightening than its original. Cameron (who also co-wrote the screenplay) also turns this into a pretty standard humans vs. aliens shoot out with lots of weapons and lots of explosions, etc. The characters in this seemed more one dimensional than those in the original. So you have an out of control Marine (Bill Paxton), an in control Marine (William Hope) and the requisite bad guy representing the company (Paul Reiser). Then of course there's Ripley who, while being far more aggressive here than in the original, also gets to explore her maternal side as she becomes a surrogate mother figure to Newt (Carrie Henn) - a little girl who's apparently the only survivor among the colonists. The scene in which Ripley holds the little girl tight as the alien is approaching and says to her ""close your eyes, baby"" is actually a virtual reshoot of a scene in which a mother comforts her daughter as a monster approaches them in a 1957 movie called ""The Monster Who Challenged The World."" And - wow - can Newt ever scream when scary things happen!<br/><br/>No. I wasn't especially impressed with this movie, although I did get a laugh near the end, when Ripley appeared to do battle with the aliens inhabiting that big robot-like suit swinging away at the creatures without mercy, and I suddenly realized that - hey - that's where James Cameron got the idea for the same kind of suits the Marines used in ""Avatar!"""
"jzappa","8","8","15","16 July 2007"," No, It Doesn't Match the Original, So Stop Pretending
","Ridley Scott's superb Alien opens in a completely foreign atmosphere, making us want to be there, attracting us mysteriously. The camera moves around slowly and quietly, exploring this place, and it makes us want to be there. This is how he elusively draws us in and begins building suspense right under our noses. James Cameron's Aliens is too impatient. There is no build-up of suspense, there are constant close-ups, everybody's made up to look attractive, and the exposition is only long because it seems to think that extension equals suspense, or that there's some quota to fill and then you can play around with your big guns and gore all you want. Cameron presents us with an action film, big fun, special effects, blow this up, blow that up, but there is an hour and 45 minutes of waiting around for it, and less than an hour of action and violence. There is a good 20 minutes of nonstop action that is actually paced quite well and feels very intense, but it's aggravating to be kept from it for so long just so the film can appear as patient and effective as the original.<br/><br/>The original Alien knew the magic of claustrophobia and the effect it can have. Cameron's nature is to do everything he can to outdo. So, he makes a bigger movie, with a bigger cast, and a bigger spaceship and bigger, louder scenes of violence, when that is not what you need to outdo the first Alien. There's nothing wrong with making the sequel more of an action film than a suspense film, but instead, he donned the film with the appearance of being patiently suspenseful and, since the film is about a big bunch of marines going to blow everything up and the film makes no attempt to be subtle, all we're doing is sitting and waiting, whereas in Ridley Scott's original, we were sitting bruising our dates' forearms.<br/><br/>One thing I must add though, is that Jennette Goldstein should've become something bigger than she was. She is a fantastic actress, and extremely hot at that. She's the biggest highlight next to Bill Paxton here in Aliens, as she is to Paxton in Cameron's once wife Bigelow's Near Dark. She should've become a star."
"AndrewArseneau","10","4","6","14 July 2017"," ""A masterwork in action filmmaking""
","Aliens is directed by James Cameron and continues the story of Ridley Scott's Alien. The story begins with a salvage crew coming across Sigourney Weaver's character, still hibernating from the events of the first film. It has been decades since the events of the first film and we learn that a colony has settled on LV-426, the planet from which the creature from the first film originated. When they lose contact with this colony, they send a team of marines in to rescue them and convince Ellen Ripley to come along as she is the only one with any experience with the creatures. What ensues is a masterwork in action filmmaking. <br/><br/>James Cameron understood that characters still matter in an action movie, which is what sets Aliens apart from many other action films today. He could have easily just made a batch of alien- fodder so that we could see plenty of violence, but he decided to make marines that are set apart enough to make us care about and know who is being attacked by the creatures. Bill Paxton's memorable performance as a meat-headed marine shines in his ability to show how the brave facade fades in the face of danger. We see this early in the film when he jokingly asks another character to do the ""knife trick,"" but when he realizes that he will be actively involved in said ""trick,"" his confidence immediately fades. Paul Reiser also gives a great performance as a pushy corporate representative who convinces Ellen Ripley to join the mission. From the moment he says the line, ""I'm an OK guy,"" we share in Ripley's experience of mistrusting his motives and his performance keeps us wondering.<br/><br/>Speaking of Ripley, Sigourney Weaver gives a phenomenal performance as the lead character again. She shows shows us how to tow a fine line between bravery and fear. This performance earned her a well deserved Oscar nod in 1987 for actress in a leading role. It still stands up a shining example of female lead in an action movie. One of my favorite moments showing bravery is when she and Carrie Hehn's character, Newt, are in a tense situation. Newt simply says, ""I'm scared"" and Ripley replies, ""Me too."" Admitting her fears helped to reinforce her strength in the face of that fear. <br/><br/>There is plenty to fear in this picture even though it is less of a horror film than its predecessor. Stan Winston's creature effects are still magnificent today, decades after the film's release. There definitely appears to be changes made from Ridley Scott's original in design, which isn't necessarily explained, but they are just as effective. The creatures have a perfect mix of natural and unnatural movements, to help make us feel uncomfortable any time they are on the screen. <br/><br/>Whereas this is an action movie at its core, the film still builds suspense well. The use of tension is not lost from the first film. Cameron includes moments in this film of silence and anticipation throughout all of the explosive action keep the audience perfectly and uncomfortably excited. James Horner's score and the soundscape all work subtly with the cinematography to build the dark and ominous landscape of LV-426.<br/><br/>The pace in this film remains steady and fast. The audience is rarely given time to rest or feel at ease, and if they are, you can bet it won't be for long. The film moves from one perilous situation to another until the very end. Even at the end, I almost felt as though I shouldn't feel at ease because I assumed something else was coming.<br/><br/>This movie is what a sequel should be. It takes what made the original a masterpiece, and expands upon it. James Cameron doesn't just make another thriller in space with excellent tension. He gives us the tension we love from it and adds wonderfully exciting action sequences. The story isn't a far-fetched reason to re-introduce these creatures, it is a fully considered and reasonable way to connect our lead character to the creatures again. In a world full of sequels and franchises, I wish more filmmakers would take cues from Aliens in how to continue a successful story. <br/><br/>Of course, there are times where the special effects show their age, but for a film made in the 80's, I never felt taken out of the experience. And that is what this movie is: an experience. Cameron expertly made me fell tense, excited, and the cast made me feel sympathetic toward the characters and the horrors they experience throughout the film. It may be a cliché, but they really don't make movies like this anymore. This film sets a standard for action films for which I wish more people would aim. For that reason, I give it a 10/10."

","You never know how a sequel will go. Well this one goes and keeps going and if you are not strapped in you will go too. Suspenseful, intriguing and adventure in space. Throw in some Marines, a good story and who didn't want to see a following to the successful first one called Alien. I remember when the first one ended, I couldn't wait to see where it picks up. I wondered and waited and out came this gem Aliens. Here we have more than one to contend with but we also have a squad of Killer Marines too so lets get it on as they say in this movie. Well get it on they do and the viewer is almost exhausted from rooting and fighting just from their own seat. Non-stop action, good story, outstanding monsters and excellent directing too. It is no wonder this movie was a success too. I have seen this so many times but it still delivers in the moment it is being watched. When I caught this in the movies, it was because my preferred movie was sold out. My family of five quickly bought tickets to this and sat three rows from the front as there were no other seats. We were just glad to get into a show. I looked over at my family and the audience during this flick several times only to see everyone glued to the screen with expressions and emotions on their faces and I wondered do I look like that? LOL yes I did. Excitement and tension does that. There is a scene in this movie where you get the chills more than once but this one stands out. It is when they discover that the Aliens are not just animals but thinking creatures. I have the collectors edition and enjoy the extended version which is almost 2.5 hours long yay! Great movie to eat while watching and popcorn or decent snack a must with a tasty drink. Keep these coming but make them good"

","This film should be required viewing at film schools across the world. With the recent release of Alien: Covenant, I am confident fans of the franchise have dusted off their copies of all the preceding films and engaged in a Xenomorph marathon.<br/><br/>Literally volumes have been written extolling the genius on display in Aliens. I whole-heartedly agree with all of the praise, but to me what truly stands out in this film is not so much the bombast (which is unbelievably great) but rather the writing and characterizations.<br/><br/>Budding directors take note: despite a large, ensemble cast, we the audience actually CARE about every single character on screen. Sure we have stereotypical archtypes, but they are so effectively written and exquisitely acted that everyone actually feels REAL. As a result, we truly empathize with the entire group. We feel their initial bravado which then, in a literal heartbeat, turns into sheer, abject terror as these hardened professional soldiers encounter a foe right out of their darkest nightmares.<br/><br/>Superlative effects and atmosphere still takes a back seat to brilliant character development and no-BS, non-exposition-laden writing. Think for a moment exactly how many lines and scenes from Aliens has become embedded into the public consciousness.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott is a brilliant director - his body of work speaks for itself and anyone who argues against this point is on very shaky ground. I retain hope that Ridley's end-game vision of the Xenomorph franchise will eventually find its feet, especially with the introduction of the Engineer race in Prometheus, which so far, after the current duology of Prometheus/Covenant has been amazing appetizers yet unfulfilling.<br/><br/>That said, we should all be thankful that we also have the equally brilliant James Cameron and the truly masterful vision he created in Aliens.<br/><br/>Absolutely Aliens is a must-watch, bucket-list film.

"roystephen-81252","8","4","6","24 February 2016"," Great SF action, but not in the same league as Alien
","Ridley Scott's Alien quickly worked its way into my all-time Top 10 and has claimed a permanent place there ever since. Aliens, however, didn't impress me that much when I first saw it in a movie theatre in 1986. Apart from a couple of genuinely gruesome moments (like when the marines discover the cocooned colonists or when Ripley and Newt stumble upon the alien queen's egg chamber), I felt Aliens took a wrong turn when it replaced the slow grinding horror and terrifying uncertainty of Alien with 'bigger and more' all-out action. Even the effects seemed cheaper although seven years had passed since the production of the first film. I was entertained, but not overly impressed.<br/><br/>I still vacillate between loving and dismissing Aliens on a daily basis. Sometimes I feel it is nearly as good as the first one, although in a very different genre. Sometimes I find it too much of an '80s action movie' (I never liked those) with all the dumb clichés of the era being too evident. The extended cut, however, is definitely better. It adds more depth to the characters and provides a more epic experience overall.<br/><br/>Maybe you just have to lower your expectations after Alien, and watch Aliens for what it is: one of the best SF/horror action flicks from the 1980s."
"paul_haakonsen","8","4","6","17 January 2016"," Tons of action and tons of aliens...
","Whereas the first, and original, ""Alien"" movie from 1979 was more of a thriller / horror Sci-Fi movie in space, then this 1986 continuation steps it up a notch and turns it into a fast paced action movie. I could imagine that some fans of the 1979 movie would not particularly enjoy this change of genre, but personally I did enjoy it quite a lot. In fact, I think that ""Aliens"" is the best movie of the entire ""Alien"" franchise so far.<br/><br/>What makes ""Aliens"" special to me is a myriad of things. First and foremost it is the abundance of alien creatures that are present in this movie. Sure, the cat-and-mouse chase from the 1979 movie with a single alien was nice. But having a whole hive of aliens running around in the 1986 was just much more menacing. And the slight evolution and changes made to the alien creatures in this 1986 movie compared to the first movie was also a welcomed detail. Secondly, director James Cameron managed to put a very interesting story to the screen, and he directed the movie quite nicely. Thirdly, the characters in the movie were all very well-detailed and fleshed out to help tell the story of ""Aliens"". And finally, the ensemble of cast, which were just fabulous.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is a definite MUST watch if you enjoy Sci-Fi, and especially if you enjoy the ""Alien"" franchise and universe.<br/><br/>The characters portrayed in ""Aliens"" were all quite well-detailed, as I mentioned above. And they all did add a lot of flavor to the story, despite not giving us much background story to their persons. But their backgrounds were not important here, as they are soldiers and their personalities more than spoke for themselves. The gallery of characters in ""Aliens"" was really good, and a big thumbs up to the team of writers who came up with these characters.<br/><br/>Equally impressive was the ensemble of cast hired to portray these fleshed out characters. And this feat is really one of the key ingredients to ""Aliens"" being such an enjoyable movie. Sigourney Weaver is, of course, the embodiment of the franchise, and she had much help from talents performers such as Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton.<br/><br/>The special effects in ""Aliens"" were great, with lots of nice details and personal touches to the individual marines. And the environment was realistic and believable.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, ""Aliens"" is the best of all the movies in the franchise. And if you have a chance to watch the special edition or director's cut edition, by all means do so, because it has so much extra contents that just adds a whole new layer of enjoyment to the movie experience."
"isaiahwilson15","10","4","6","6 March 2015"," Among all the James Cameron movies, this one is the absolute best!
","Aliens has literally everything I look for in an action movie. The cast is the base of this movie's greatness, as each supporting character has a very equal level of importance. You know its not a James Cameron film without the inclusion of a powerful female character, and Ripley serves as the archetype for the perfect female lead character. Ellen Ripley's roles as an astronaut, soldier, and mother help make her the perfect choice to lead this group of soldiers in the fight against the Alien. The Aliens in this movie are back and man are they scary. James Cameron's close attention to the special effects once again helps elevate all aspects of his movie. Everything from the Aliens to the movie sets add to the thrill and suspense of this movie. Finally on top of all of that, you have Hudson. Hudson well, you'll just have to watch the movie to see why Bill Paxton's Hudson is the best part of Aliens. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with action, comedy, thrills, and some frightening moments, than this is the best movie you could possibly choose."

","Seven years after the groundbreaking movie, Alien, James Cameron picks up the sequel which many people find better than the first. Sure there are some people that disagree, but the ones the think this is the best are entitled to think so. 1979's Alien was a sci-fi/horror, whereas this is a sic-fi/action.<br/><br/>About 60 years after the deadly encounter with the alien that wiped out her crew, Ellen Ripley is found on a spaceship and brought home. No such aliens have been found and foreign planets have been starting to colonize. She joins a team of tough space marines to destroy any aliens they find and save any human residents. The mission proves deadly as they face many aliens and the Mother Alien. Ripley must not only face her fears again, but also protect a little girl who's family was destroyed by the aliens and who has been like a daughter to her.<br/><br/>The element of horror incorporated in the first was great and original, but everything that the first movie had was done better. The action is better, special effects are better, sets are better, cinematography is better, excitement is stronger, the pace is faster. I do love both movies, this one just did a bigger number on me.<br/><br/>4/4"
"joeshing","9","4","6","26 October 2014"," Not better than the first... but
","James Cameron did a fantastic job here. I still prefer the first but we can see Cameron taking his mechanised mania to the extreme with his usual sensibilities. Do I make much sense? Ripley is understandably annoyed at the presence of a synthetic, given what happened last time, but she soon has her hands full looking after the colony's only survivor – little girl Newt (Carrie Henn, who can scream at a pitch I didn't think was possible for humans). After the crew unwittingly stumbles into an alien nest, most of the marines are soon wiped out, leading Hudson to change his tune very fast (""Game over, man. Game over!"")."
"bowmanblue","10","4","6","19 October 2014"," Not bad for a... human (made film)
","If you're into sci-fi then you should have seen Aliens by now. It's the - not particularly imaginatively - titled sequel to the 1979 'haunted house is space' film Alien. And, depending on how you like your science fiction, will determine exactly which of the two you'll like the best (it's worth noting that whichever one you pick, you'll probably agree that they're both up there with the best science fiction films ever made).<br/><br/>Alien is dark, quiet and moody. Its successor is loud, brash and big as it follows the sole survivor of the first film, Ellen Ripley, as she returns to Earth after floating in space for 57 years, only to find that the planet where she first encountered the xenomorph has been colonised. Then - guess what - all contact is lost with colony and she has to accompany a team of space marines in a rescue mission (that does not go well).<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for her performance. However, it's hard to pick out a stand-out performance here. It's rare in a movie when you know that half of the cast are going to end up on the wrong end of a monster's teeth to really care about them. Yet, here you find yourself rooting for even the lowliest of cast members.<br/><br/>The best part of Aliens (just like Star Wars) is that it's 'timeless.' We're now nearly thirty years on from its creation and yet it still looks as good. The special effects (and general atmosphere) beat anything made today and current films could really take a lead out of its book when it comes to using miniature models over excessive CGI.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Aliens, you should. Normally I would recommend it for fans of the action/sci-fi/horror genres. However, this is a film that defined the genre and has been copied (poorly) to this day (think the Resident Evil films to name but a few). Therefore, I truly believe people that don't always want to watch horror may ever enjoy it (maybe not as much as me, but I think most will appreciate that this is a behemoth in modern film history and should at least be respected, if not adored as much as I do).<br/><br/>And remember... there's something moving in here and it ain't us!"
"SugarandIce","10","4","6","8 December 2013"," One of the best films of all time.
","Alien is an excellent horror film. Cameron, wisely decided to take the sequel in its own direction and with that, he created a mind bogglingly entertaining film that still manages to preserve the atmosphere of the first movie. Arguably, the elements he bring actually top what the original offered. This is a movie that is iconic in every aspect: in scenes and in dialogue. It holds up extremely well despite being nearly thirty years old. The effects are amazing, perhaps the best animatronics I've ever seen. The final battle with its buildup and shock, pays off and blows you away. Its lead, Ripley, remains one of the best female characters (and just plain characters) of all time, but the rest of the cast are memorable and interesting too. In my opinion, this is a film that belongs extremely high up in any scifi fan's top ten."
"estebangonzalez10","8","4","6","20 June 2012"," Aliens is a good action film but not as great as Alien
","¨We'd better get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon, and they mostly come at night¨<br/><br/>Many people consider Aliens to be better or at least at the same level as its predecessor, Alien, but I found it an inferior film in many ways. In my opinion Alien is a perfect film, while Aliens despite being very entertaining is not nearly as scary and has its flaws. This sequel was directed by James Cameron and his trademarks are all over this film. Ridley Scott had managed to direct a small psychological science fiction horror flick, while Cameron made a much larger film, with many aliens, more characters, and a lot more action. This is more of a blockbuster movie than anything else. I've always been a fan of much quieter films that focus on psychological scares than big budget action movies so that may be one of the reasons why I liked Alien much more than Aliens. There is no doubt about Cameron's ability to direct these big budget movies and he always delivers spectacular visual effects, but story wise his films are sometimes lacking in quality. The characters are many times one dimensional and that is exactly the case in Aliens. The only character I really liked in this film and that has depth is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Unlike in Alien where the main character seemed to be the alien despite not showing up much on screen; in Aliens we have plenty of screen time for the aliens, but I never felt like they were a main character. It's as if so much overexposure to them made me care less about the aliens and more about Ripley. So in conclusion Alien was the creature's movie, while Aliens is Weaver's film. She has a very strong role and her presence is what has made this film so successful. She carries the film and in a way makes us forget about the rest of the one dimensional characters. The story continues right where the original left off with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the Nostromo shuttle in hypersleep along with her cat. She is awaken by a salvage team that has found her vessel drifting through space. Burke (Paul Reiser), who works for the same company that the original crew members worked for, informs Ripley that she has been asleep for 57 years. The company briefs Ripley as to what happened with the ship and the rest of the members, and don't believe her story. They say that if her story were true then the colony of over 60 families that has been living on the planet where she claims to have seen the derailed ship would have encountered the aliens by now. The colony has been there for over twenty years without experiencing difficulties, and Ripley is discharged as a space pilot. Some time later, when the company loses contact with the colony, Burke asks Ripley to come along with them as a consultant. The company sends a military team to find out what has happened to the colonists and Ripley is offered to come along with them reinstating her if she does so. This is just an excuse for Cameron to get the crew in the same planet as the aliens and have much more action. Ripley decides to travel with the team which consists of Lt. Gorman (William Hope), the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), Pvt. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton), Cpl. Ferro (Colette Hiller), among many other soldiers who are heavily armed and qualified. Once they reach the planet they find no sign of any colonists, except for a ten year old girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who has managed to survive and tells them that monsters have killed the rest, and that they will come for them as well.<br/><br/>This film marked a breakthrough in action films, but isn't really as scary as the original movie. The suspense and psychological horror is replaced with action packed shootouts and explosions. There are many more characters and a lot more aliens so there are a lot of things happening. This is what makes Aliens more entertaining for some people. Cameron had recently come from directing The Terminator so he was already making a name for himself and was able to work with a good budget. He is among the best when it comes to visuals and special effects and many of the visuals in this movie still look great today. Aliens won two Oscars for this reason. I'm not a huge fan of Cameron's work, although I have to admit Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies ever and definitely my favorite James Cameron film. The screenplay was also written by Cameron along with the help of screenwriters David Giler and Walter Hill, and I had small issues with it, although the spectacular action sequences saved it. This is Sigourney Weaver's film and she truly broke out as an A-list actress with this movie. She shines as a true female action hero who's strong and emotional at the same time. Aliens is a good film, just not as perfect as Alien.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"thesar-2","10","4","6","18 January 2011"," Get Away From Her...I would've.
","There should be a rule in Hollywood. When Cameron makes a ""Part II,"" that should be the end to the series as he sure knows how to complete any story with both a bang and an absolute conclusion. Want evidence? <br/><br/>Terminator 2 was a great ending and a complete story to the Big-Screen Sarah Connor chronicles. But no, they ruined it once with Terminator 3 and further beat that horse with Terminator: Salvation.<br/><br/>Piranha II, I've been told, isn't exactly his fault and I'm glad they did end it there. (The incredibly superior 2010 ""remake/reboot"" Piranha 3D doesn't count as part of that series.)<br/><br/>As for Avatar 2: Electric Boogaloo, I sincerely hope that's the finale. But, then, I wasn't a fan of the first and probably won't see his follow-up anyways.<br/><br/>And nowAliens solidified a story so vividly, brilliantly and completely, there should've never been an Alien3, and if you want proof: Watch this, absorb it, love it and then view just the first few minutes of Alien3 to prove it should never had been filmed.<br/><br/>I digress; this is about the masterpiece Aliens. It's not just one of the, if not thee, best sequels ever, it's a perfect film in its own right. Much like what Cameron's ex-Linda Hamilton did to transform an already good character, Sarah Connor, into excellence (from The Terminator to Terminator 2: Judgment Day,) Sigourney Weaver also blossomed her already good character of Ellen Ripley into an Academy Award nomination (she should've won.)<br/><br/>Beyond her awesome performance, Aliens is pitch perfect in all other categories: mind-blowing cinematography, sets, landscaping and special effects, excellent and eerie score, completely believable acting and dialogue, suspense, drama, action, adventure, science fiction, comedy (thanks, Bill ""Game Over, Man!"" Paxton,) the human touch, etc. etc.I can't literally express on how this movie works everywhere.<br/><br/>There are those out there that state the movie Alien is the best science fiction movie ever and the best in this series. I wholeheartedly disagree. Alien was the warm up for the real deal. It set the stage and introduced the characters and setting, though it was enormously toned down and 134% slower, comparatively speaking, but still: Alien gave us enough to want 10x more. And Mr. Cameron and the rest of the excellent cast & crew delivered 50x more.<br/><br/>Stuck asleep in a cryogenic tube in deep space for 57 years (or so we're told in a dream sequence, I'm guessing we have to believe she was told that awake at some point,) alien-survivor Ripley is rescued and brought back to Earth. Incredibly, well, maybe not – we're dealing with humans here, she's blamed solely on destroying a multimillion dollar ship in order to destroy an alien no one on Earth heard scream.<br/><br/>She's really screwed up: she's having chest-breaking nightmares, she's been demoted to working grunt jobs and she's concerned about colonists who just happened to be on the same rock where Ripley and her deceased crew intercepted the fateful signal that unleashed the first alien. Again: Humans.<br/><br/>Now, she's coerced into returning to the lion's den, in one of the most believable reasons in movie history to get the original movie's stars back for more. In most lame sequels, you can all but see dollar signs in the original actor's eyes when they stumble back in for some more torture.<br/><br/>She's quite suspicious, uneasy and doesn't even trust the tough marines that follow her in a rescue mission to save the colonists who failed to (surprise) report in.<br/><br/>When they get to their (mostly final) destination, it's up to everyday woman Ripley to attempt to knock sense into the otherwise senseless brute force called soldiers. Without much time lapsing, they learn and pretty fast that, though one alien is badass and hard to take on, 600 are simply impossible. Much like the aliens are really larger versions of ants, it's relevant to say it would be easier for snail to escape an ant attack.<br/><br/>Pretty much, I've given you the set up. There's so much more in this movienamely from the new characters – remember everyone but one died in #1? Oops, spoiler for anyone starting with just this one – and their back stories. Such as the lone/young survivor Newt (Henn,) the possibly corrupt android Bishop (Henriksen) who will become a staple for the series, the after-series, and elevate his movie status from simple B-movies and the personification of ""The Company"" Carter Burke (Reiser.)<br/><br/>Did I mention there's a special guest in the closing? Well, if you haven't seen this, but undoubtedly have seen Avatar, you'll see where Cameron got all his ideas from. Unfortunately for this next generation, the exceeding advanced Aliens proved to have not only one of the most fantastic, exciting and suspenseful conclusions on record, it really blew anything Avatar produced out of Pandora. On a related note, I remember Aliens's premiere on local TV and I was blown away they allowed the word ""bitch"" in the famous ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" line to still be said. And that must've been the downfall of America, right, right-wingers?<br/><br/>AnywaysI can't say enough about one of my all time favorite films. If the original theatre version is still in your collection or that's all Netflix will carry, disregard or eliminate it from your queue. Sure, the Special Edition, the one you should see, is longer, but the motivations behind Ripley are more clearly defined and there's a cool shoot-'em-up scene that might be irrelevant, but fun to watch nonetheless.<br/><br/>Weaver put everything into this role, made the entire experience come together and more accessible to a wider audience as I am aware most women's idea for movie night doesn't include the space-alien genre. This was thee video game movie to watch before video games became as real as they are today. This is real filmmakingnot the horrid CGI generation of today."
"craig-b-kerr","10","4","6","13 March 2010"," A very good film
","This film is one of those sci-fi rarities. Lead by an amazing actress, Sigourney Weaver, and a very strong supporting cast, the story is brought upon us at an amazingly quick pace. Usually with sci-fi films we are given a cheap CGI alien. In this we have both animatronics and people in costumes. Back to the movie.<br/><br/>As we are taken into the colony we see evidence of the aliens' existence and we know straight away. They need to get out of there. And we are proved right. The marines unfortunately venture into the hive, encounter a hived victim, and several characters meet their fates, this is not necessarily a good thing though, as they are not properly developed throughout the movie. The remaining survivors unravel though.<br/><br/>A few stereotypes unveil in the cast as well. We have the money fuelled businessman, the tough girl, the natural leader, and the mysterious character that knows all about the elusive and dangerous xenomorphs. This being Ellen Ripley.<br/><br/>The two strongest characters in my opinion are Ellen Ripley and Vasquez because for those who have seen Alien, we know a lot about Ripley, I was able to gain a lot of information from the actions of Vasquez, she liked attention, but she was very dominant and liked to let people know what their place was, as we see from several parts of dialogue in the movie."
"ahifi","9","4","6","12 December 2009"," Superb action movie with heart
","Aliens is a classic. Even 23 years after its release and multiple watches later, it still captures my attention when channel flicking. Everything in the movie is top-notch and I mean EVERYTHING. Acting, script, plot, story, direction, editing, sound, props...you name it, it does it to such a high quality.<br/><br/>Ripley returns and proves that she truly is one of cinema's most iconic characters; a kick-ass female who's more in-tune with her feminine side than Sarah Connor, but no less dangerous. She's joined by the likes of the hardened but amiable Hicks (Michael Biehn), Bishop (played by the fantastic Lance Henriksen) and many other memorable characters.<br/><br/>Aliens is pretty much the highest quality action/sci-fi movie out there, even all the way down to the subtext. It surpassed its sequel, but at the same time it's a different beast to its predecessor. It has yet to be beaten in its class and rightfully so. 10/10"
"TheUnknown837-1","10","4","6","27 November 2009"," the second installment in the ""Alien"" saga is not only powerful in its visuals and genuinely thrilling, but a truly visionary science-fiction masterpiece
","Very much like ""Psycho"", the first ""Alien"" movie received some mixed reactions upon its first release. Some admired it for its ability to twist the stomachs of its audiences; others thought it was overkill and disgusting. But as with Hitchcock's film, as time went by and people caught up with the genius of the masterpiece, it was only a matter of time before a sequel was made. And the sequel, titled ""Aliens"" is the closest a sequel has ever come to being equal to its predecessor. This is not only a great science-fiction movie, but it's a highly entertaining and gut-wrenching thrill ride that comes second I think to ""Die Hard"" as the greatest action movie of all time.<br/><br/>In ""Aliens"", the sole survivor of the first movie, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has finally been picked up, still asleep in suspended animation after fifty-seven years. Many things have changed since her first encounter with the slimy parasitic monster from before. The planet from where the creature came from has been colonized. And then, not so coincidentally as Ripley soon finds out, contact is lost with the people on the planet and she will have to contend with the creatures, this time alongside a group of Marines. And just like before, it turns out to be a race against time for them to escape before the aliens, or something else, kills them.<br/><br/>If you want a scary movie, ""Aliens"" will deliver. If you want a movie with lots of buildup and tons of successive action sequences, the movie will not disappoint you either. But here's what makes it so special. It will give you what you're expecting, but what you don't expect from such a movie of such a genre is visionary creativity at its very best. It's so much more than just a scary movie. It's backed by a plot and a strong story, great characters, and the special effects and suspense is all secondary to this. Combined, it forms a masterpiece.<br/><br/>James Cameron who directed the picture also wrote the screenplay and it's these two elements that make ""Aliens"" what it is. At a certain point in the movie, Cameron does throw one scary scene after another at you, but before that, it's about developing the story with surprisingly strong characters. Each one is well-written and serves his or her purpose in the story. It's admirable again to see women in a science-fiction film not demoted to simply screaming and running away in the background. As in the first film, Sigourney Weaver's performance is the strongest accolade the movie has to boast. Michael Biehn plays very much the same character he did in Cameron's previous film ""The Terminator"" and he plays it just as well. There's also a great touch of Weaver's character bonding with a little girl played by Carrie Henn which in turn fleshes them out as human beings instead of just stock characters. But what I was really astounded by was the Bill Paxton character: a Marine who whines and complains and yammers throughout the whole story. The genius of Cameron's writing and Paxton's performance is that the character gripes nonstop and yet he's only irritating to the other characters and not to the audience whereas a weaker writing or performance would have done just the opposite.<br/><br/>I saved talking about the visuals of the movie till after the characterization because that's how they rank in importance. Visually, the movie is even better than its predecessor. I do think the movie toned down just a little too much how dangerous just one of the creatures are, but perhaps this is necessary since there are dozens of them crawling and leaping and goring throughout the story. The aliens are still very scary in all three of their stages, but they are not reduced to simply running around chasing the humans. Again, Cameron adds some great new imaginative ideas based off the lifestyle and habits of colonial insects to make these creatures even more formidable and vicious.<br/><br/>Some consider this movie to be even better than the first ""Alien"" picture. I have to disagree with that point, but it is very close between the two movies. Like the first, there are two versions: a theatrical release and the director's cut. My preference is the latter, since it opens up more imaginative scenes and fills some holes and overall completes the visionary masterpiece that James Cameron directed twenty-three years ago."

","Ripley has been found in deep space by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station to be awoken from her 57 year sleep. Here she is mortified to find that the planet on which herself and her now deceased Nostromo crew found the Alien, LV-426, has been colonised by Weyland-Yutani Company. Suffice to say that when The Company representative, Burke, tells her that all contact is lost, she's not in the least bit surprised. Unable to get anyone to believe her about what happened to the Nostromo crew, Ripley is cajoled into going back to LV-426 with a crack team of space marines to seek, destroy or rescue...<br/><br/>How do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too!<br/><br/>They mostly come at night - mowstly.<br/><br/>Where Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God). <br/><br/>Thematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable. None more so as we enter the film at the half way point, because here we realise that we have characters to care about. Blood, brains and brawn, all led by a heroine of considerable guile and guts. 10/10"
"philip-473","10","4","6","25 October 2008"," What can I say?
","This has the makings of a classic. It's awesome in every way. Casting, effects and plot (simple, yet effective. Kinda like Transformers).<br/><br/>First is plot, since this takes place after the first film. I was thinking that it would follow the way of it's predecessor. But the movie gives us a more in-depth look of the alien (which is also referred to as the Xenomorph). Plus introduces the Alien Queen to the franchise.<br/><br/>Now the cast, we do have recognizable names (Of course). I won't give names like I normally would, since I want to keep this review short and simple. But they all did good jobs.<br/><br/>The effects are just amazing, I have more or less, nothing to say except for this: That was a bold move James Cameron did with the Alien Queen (not removing the cables and wires digitally that is).<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best, and I recommend that you see it (unless you hate the aliens)."

","The first movie was extremely good, then I heard that the sequel was almost just as good or even better. In the first movie, there was one alien, in the next one: there is hundreds of them. I had no idea how Aliens was better than Alien, because I don't think that many sequels become this good. Well, I had no idea how the second Godfather would be so good when I thought the first one was good enough. I write books and I already said to myself I will not make any sequels for my books because most sequels never turn out to be better than the first. I clearly underestimated how good this movie would, it was much better than I expected, same with the Godfather Part II. I am now in love with the first and second Alien movies. Good title, they don't call the movie: Alien 2, just Aliens meaning more than one. In my opinion Ripley is the best female ass kicker in all of movies. The acting is very good in this movie, the special effects are very good, intense action, scary, and extremely powerful. In my opinion the second best Sci-fi sequel behind The Empire Strikes Back."

","Cameron's Aliens is a completely different beast to Ridey Scott's original film. Those who tout Cameron's sequel as a better film are missing the point. From a gung-ho, blockbuster point of view, yes, Cameron's film is audacious, thrilling, brilliant.<br/><br/>The original film was a sublimely intellectual exploration into the abject horror of psycho-sexual not-human monstrousness. It reached a level of horror and monstrousness that is not, not could be, matched by Cameron's film. <br/><br/>Luckily, he is clever enough to realise this. The point of the original Alien film is that the creature is entirely semblant and lacks definition; culturally as well as thematically. By the time Cameron's sequel was released, the creature became absorbed into popular culture and to present it once again as the unknown would have been a failure. This is why Alien 3 failed. It is a rehash of Alien, and while it contains the obligatory horror film shocks and schlock content, it lacks the terrible subconscious entry into the human body that the alien signifies, and was not successfully picked up until, somewhat surprisingly, Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>So, Cameron's film is a big, muscular blockbuster, whose contribution to the series is to expand the alien canon through the introduction of the Queen - still one of the greatest screen 'villians' ever - and the theme of motherhood in a very different way to the original film through the character of Newt.<br/><br/>I love this film; its big muscular Marines with their big guns and black humour never outgrow or undermine the subtle horror flourishes of the alien universe, but their camaraderie and arrogance makes their fallibility all the more inevitable. And with the use of the character Carter Burke, we are left thinking, like Ripley, which species is worse.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic sequel, and one of the greatest science fiction action horrors of all time, but it's not better than Alien (and that doesn't mean it's not as good...)!"

","I'd put this in my top 5 of all time as well as blade runner. The SE special edition features a family who happens upon the egg chamber, setting off events, which I don't think was in the original. Also the robotic guns in the tunnel holding off the aliens. The plot and acting at times are cartoonish and outlandish, but as a teen when first seeing it, was a plus. Once they're killed off, it's Ripley/Weaver in her element. The technological aspects were very visionary at the time, when we had Commodore 64s or such. The only aspect that 'is showing some wear' was the flight of the spacecraft against the clouds...a mildly dated, toylike but still quite good. The movie had a supersize me approach, the more the merrier. Aliens was the peak of this series, though Alien vs. Predator was excellent..a nice comeback. The video game was also excellent, in it's time."

Probably the best in the series and the director's cut add SO MUCH MORE to the story that you'd be a fool not to see how Aliens was really meant to be seen. The acting is so top notch and sucks you in. You get a feel for the characters without them being too typical or cookie-cutter. You root for the good guys and curse the bad guys and that the Aliens get shot up good. Probably one of the best alien sci-fi movies of all time with some great one-liners and action sequences.

","James Cameron's Aliens is one of the best sequels ever made. Being a sequel to the brilliant Alien is not easy, yet this movie manages to hold its own and create its own atmosphere and tone. And succeeding at it.<br/><br/>What impresses me is that the Alien universe allowed a fantastic suspense/horror first film as well as a fantastic action sequel.<br/><br/>The fact that it's an action movie does not bother me. It wasn't trying to imitate the original or to be a suspense movie. It was trying to be a more accessible shoot-em-up movie loaded with guns, explosions and humor and I think James Cameron did an amazing job with the script and the direction.<br/><br/>The characters are well-written. You know they're disposable, yet they have each one a different charm that I really like in ensemble casts. Bill Paxton being particularly funny as Pvt. Hudson.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn are great together as Ripley and Hicks respectively. The chemistry was good and it allowed the characters to have some valuable interaction without distracting from the action.<br/><br/>The aliens were cool-looking and they make some great villains. They are not scary like the creature in Alien was, and they are killed like bugs by the marines, but still, they fit as well in an action movie as they did in a suspense/horror one."

Its action from the very start. Once again Sigourney Weaver returns as Riply, the only surviver from the Nostromo from the first movie. This is probably Weaver's best performance throughout the franchise. She is joined by an array of new characters, who try to help her defeat the monstrous aliens from the first movie.

Although it is an old film with low graphics compared to today's standards, it still is awesome and completely believable. Hollywood needs to know that sometimes, CGI doesn't make monsters look better, let alone action. The most important aspect of this film is its dynamic storyline. It starts out with a futuristic world, then comes down to the dark and gloomy techy hallways of doom with which the Aliens lurk. Nothing tops that! I'm pretty sure the rating for this film says it all and there's no other way to get you to know how good it is unless you watch it.

There was some real horror to go along with major suspense and, even though I had to go so bad I almost wet myself, I could not tear myself away for the last 20 minutes. It was f*ucking awesome!

"stryker1121","Null","4","6","8 August 2006"," Intense, jaw-dropping, brilliant ""analog"" action flick
","Many times replicated, never equaled, Aliens is the best action movie of all time. There is nothing that even comes very close. It's hard to articulate the effect this film has had on me. It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that doesn't spoil with time and so-called ""maturity."" The first time I saw Aliens was at a friend's house. I was 13 and I was totally blown away. I'm now 31 and Aliens still rocks my world. Where Alien is stark and slinking and great in its own way, the sequel is bombastic and balls-to-the-wall.<br/><br/>So many scenes stand out. I'll never forget my initial viewing of the terrifying, kick-ass sequence where the creatures first attack the Space Marines (""They're all around us man!"") However, the brilliance of this film lies in the fact that the ""quiet"" scenes are as powerful as the action-packed ones: The hint of romance as Hicks demonstrates his assault rifle to Ripley; the look of despair on Ripley's face when she's told there are families colonizing the planet.<br/><br/>I will always love Weaver for her achingly intense performance here. I've never seen another like it in the genre. The supporting cast is wonderful, as well. Standouts include Biehn (also awesome in Terminator), Henricksen, Reiser and of course Bill Paxton, who practically steals the show.<br/><br/>You look at sci-fi/action flicks today, and most of em are soulless exercises in CGI. Cameron's models and costumed monsters are much more effective than anything George Lucas tried in the Star Wars prequels."
"bphere","10","4","6","16 April 2006"," in space no one hears you scream except the audience!
","let me begin by saying that this film is magnificent. Working from a 26 million dollar (US) budget and a relatively unknown cast aside from Ms. Weaver, James Cameron broke the mold and blew the lid off of sci-fi action films with this one.<br/><br/>The first Alien was a miracle unto itself. After slyly reversing the lead roles and creating a heroine with Sigourney's Ripley, Scott masterminded a haunted house in outer space that broke taboos aplenty in the seventies. Learning that the cast including veronica cartwright and everyone else were not privy to what was going to happen during the first chest-burster sequence, their reactions are still priceless.<br/><br/>How could Fox ever improve upon a film like Ridley's? After a pitch meeting with newbie, James Cameron, and him turning down a remake of Spartacus, the creative exec shouted 'what about alien 2?' James took a seat and listened then ran off to create a masterpiece. The difference between these two films is the subtext. Alien had none. As beautiful as it was, the characters were clichÃ© and the dialogue lame. Ian holm did a great job, but aside from his malfunctioning synthetic, there wasn't much else.<br/><br/>James built a force to reckon with around Ripley. Corporal Hicks, a talented Michael Biehn, private Hudson, the whiny soldier on his last days of service, private velasqez, the male-ass kicken female, the corporate snake played wonderfully by the slithering Paul Reiser and the sympathetic synthetic played by Lance Henriksen. These characters were drawn well from beginning to end and we sensed a bit of family between them. And lastly, Newt, the darling Carrie Henn who has since abandoned her days of acting and has become a grade school teacher. How I long for her to scream once more! With that said, the reason why this film worked was that it's a film in its own. There is no ""2"" after it and the names spells it all. Aliens is about multiple aliens. Multiple facets of life. The death of Ripley's daughter and her crying in the beginning saying that she promised to be home for her 6th birthday. Weyland Yutani playing the behind the scenes chess player and compromising people's lives in order to make a buck. (Haliburton anyone?) The concept of synthetics and androids in everyday life, being 1986 this seemed almost implausible, but now it's 2006 and those are just right around the corner. Did anyone catch the close resemblance between Bishop's hyperdyne system model and mr. cameron's cyberdyne systems from terminator? With only six variations of the 'alien suit' and the abandonment of H.R. Giger's designs, I was hesitant but became a huge fan after my first viewing of this film. I was 8 years old when I first saw it and it still has me in awe. This film is a DRASTIC departure from Ridley's haunted house on the nostromo. His was moody, dark, and claustrophobic. Cameron's is an extravagant action spectacle with character substance."
"dontjuststareatiteatit","10","4","6","14 April 2006"," THE Definitive Action Movie
","1986. The world had just gotten off the heals of The Terminator, The Empire Strikes Back, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and The Temple of Doom. Audiences thought they had seen it all. That was until the summer rolled around. The world of the action movie hasn't been the same since. Aliens, James Cameron second sci-fi epic masterpiece, arrived and smashed the limits of what a movie could do and raised the bar for all future action movies to come.<br/><br/>Taking the premise of Ridley Scott's horror masterpiece, James Cameron, in a self-penned screenplay, turned it into one of the most exciting visual experiences I have ever taken part of. The screenplay, coming in at around 2 hours and 20 minutes, takes its time and sets up the characters so that we feel more for them. We don't even see an alien on the screen until almost an hour into the movie. Each character is fully developed and we cringe when we see them die. The horror that the aliens bring is all the more magnified because of our deeper understanding of the characters emotions and their connections to each other. Notice Vasquez's and Lt. Gorman's death together. Since early on the in the movie, Cameron developed their dislike for each other. Building up the tension between these two characters, we feel the pay off when we see them except death together. Anyone who says action movies must be devoid of emotion and sit on some nihilistic plane, has obviously never seen this movie.<br/><br/>Using his groundbreaking screenplay, Cameron then weaves a tale so rich in visuals and sounds that we become fully immersed in the story. Winning the 1987 Academy Awards for Best Sound Effect and Best Visual Effects, also being nominated for best film editing, original score, best art direction and best sound, Cameron innovated the way the technology of the time was used to make movies. Notice his stunning use of cinematography and editing to create this future, alien planet. Scenes are drab and dark up until the action starts, when Cameron paints the screen with bright colors to create a sense of urgency. Take the scene towards the end of the film, when the aliens first break into the compound. He saturates the screen with red for about 5 minutes. Then switches it back when the action is done. This technique has been copied many times since this film (re: Hunt For the Red October).<br/><br/>And, last but most certainly not least, we can forget to mention Cameron's casting choices. Weaver, looking as sexy as she did the rest of the 80's, plays the role of a lifetime. It's too bad Hollywood doesn't produce roles like this anymore. Cameron created such mutli-dimensional characters that the actors were able to really sink their teeth into them. Bill Paxton plays Hudson to perfection, delivering hilarious, 80's style lines, right when needed. Other notable performances include Jenette Goldstein's Vasquez and Carrie Henn's Newt.<br/><br/>All in all, this by far Cameron's most accomplished work. His work on the first Terminator got everyone's attention but it was this film that proved his genius. If it wasn't for Aliens, Cameron's subsequent, big-budget ""The Abyss"" and ""Terminator 2"" would not have been made. All in all, this film ranks as one of the most revolutionary visions of the past 25 years and among one of the best films ever produced. A must for all movie fans. 10/10"
"eternalsea","10","4","6","4 April 2006"," Could be the greatest sequel of all time.
","Sequels rarely stand up to the original. Jaws, Jurassic Park and Predator are all big Hollywood franchises that started at a very high standard but as time continued they simply grew worse and worse. However there are those sequels that many believe to be better than their predecessors. The Godfather part 2 and The Empire strikes back are a few of the names but in my opinion the best of this rare breed is the 2nd in the Alien saga. Aliens. The story starts with Ripley being found in space, shes has been floating their for 56 years but due to hyper sleep hasn't aged a day. The company Weyland Yutani picks here up and brings here back to a space station, where She tells them of her encounter of the Alien, which is met with ridicule and disbelief. However the company looses contact with the farmers that mine on the alien planet and together with a group of marines Ripley returns to face her demons. The acting is the best the series ever offered with Sigourney Weaver picking up an Oscar nomination and rightly so. Michael Biehn and Lance Hennrikson are very impressive, giving great depth to their characters. Carrie Henn is a great new comer, but for some odd reason has never worked again. The thrills are in high supply here as are the often grisly scares. The Aliens look even meaner here than they did in the original and the Queen when she appears is possibly the most frightening creature ever to grace are screens. Another great point Aliens offers is the fact you care for its characters, Even the asshole marine types. This means that when ever peril is near we feel even more anxious, simply because we have grown attached to those for whom the danger looms. Few movies these days have that quality, indeed the only action orientated film of the last 15 years that had this factor is the original Jurassic Park. So to conclude Aliens is really worth seeing. Its well acted, well written and highly entertaining. You would be a fool to give this one a miss."

Sigourney Weaver stars as Ripley, the only survivor of the Nostromo, where the first Alien film is placed on. 57 years have passed and Ripley's daughter has died and her story is met with disbelief. When Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt. Gorman (William Hope) ask Ripley to join an expedition with Colonial Marines to LV-426, which is now being terraformed to be able to live on, because there has been no contact with the colony, Ripley says no. After having more dreams of the Alien, Ripley realizes that the only way to banish the Alien out of her dreams is to destroy them all. So she goes with the Marines, including Cpl. HIcks (Michael Biehn), Pvt. Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein), and Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton).<br/><br/>When Ripley, Burke, Gorman, and the Marines reach the planet, they discover evidence of a major battle with the Aliens including the Alien's acid blood, but find no bodies of any kind. After checking out the main complex, Ripley and the rest discover Newt, a little girl, who is the only survivor of the colony. Ripley feels a sense of kinship and protectiveness to the little girl and decides to protect her with all of her power.<br/><br/>When the colony members are found in the building making the air, the Marines discover that the people were all used for incubators for the Aliens. After they watch a still live woman die from the escaping alien, they engage in a major battle with the aliens that totally decimates most of the team.<br/><br/>After the battle, the survivors-Ripley, Newt, Hicks, Burke, Gorman, Vasquez, and Hudson-decide to leave and nuke the planet from their ship. When an Alien kills the pilot and the co-pilot and the ship crashes, they are stuck on the planet. After setting up a safe place in the main colony complex, they decide to try and wait out until rescue comes. Bishop, an android (played by Lance Henriksen), goes to call the extra ship down to rescue them.<br/><br/>While the ship is coming, the others are attacked and most of them die. When Newt gets captured to become an incubator and Hicks is wounded, Ripley decides that she will not let that little girl die and goes in the nest. After a frantic search and a joyous reunion, Ripley realizes what is laying the eggs. The Queen, who is bigger than all the others. After Ripley destroys her eggs, the Queen goes on a rampage on a quest to kill Ripley.<br/><br/>With tons of action, lots of Aliens, a budding romance between Ripley and Hicks, and the rescue of Newt, this movie is the best movie ever! The last hour has some of the greatest action sequences in movie history, including the famous fight between Ripley and the Queen in the Power loader! This movie is so awesome so see it! You won't regret it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"CarsonTrent","8","4","6","3 March 2006"," Brilliant film-making
","Claustrophobic and dark and also action-pumped, this sequel manages to beautifully stand on its own but also compliment on the first movie. It's only natural that in order to evolve you have to reinvent but not miss out on the mystique, the soul of the movie, which is preserved perfectly in this one, as it is in all 4 Alien movies. Actually the Alien series viewed as a whole is like a work of art on its own, and all 4 compliment on each other, although being also significant different and similar, none of them repeating itself. Also you don't have to be too familiar with the previous movie in order to understand what's going on in each of them. Whoever had this fact in sight really did a great job. <br/><br/>I believe maybe this one remains my favorite, beside Bill Paxton being cast in it, for benefiting of being made in the 80's, regarding complimenting a great idea/ story with perfect special effects, in this case the alien which couldn't look more real. I think regarding sci-fi this was the most interesting decade, because it benefited of altogether richer story/special effects ratio than recent films where pyrotechnics and special effects seem to be the only interest of producers. It was the melting-point of two movie making schools which created quite some timeless classics."
"freaky_dave","10","4","6","1 March 2006"," Another Cameron Classic
","Like Terminator, Cameron's breakthrough film, Aliens is another classic directed by him that mixes the genres of horror and science-fiction as well as action. Its also one of my favorite movies like Terminator, and because of this Cameron gets a lot of respect from me. Two classics by the same director? You just can't go wrong with that.<br/><br/>Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in a role that never quite type cast her) is found 57 years after the first Alien film. She is picked up by a salvage team and sent back to Earth, where things have changed quite a bit during her very long sleep. She also discovers that she has outlived her daughter, but the edited version doesn't give her anytime to mourn. I've never seen the director's cut, but I heard it goes into more detail about this.<br/><br/>Not long after this she is sent to some sort of board meeting where she has to explain what happen. Her story is of course meant with skepticism, but it is at this meeting that she finds out that LV-426, the planet where she first discovered the hostile Alien with her Nostromo Crew, has now been occupied by colonists who are now able to live on the harsh planet because of Atmosphere Processors.<br/><br/>The skepticism proves false though when transmissions with the colonists are suddenly lost. So Ripley, with a high-tech combat team of marines to back her up, returns to the planet to destroy the vicious creatures forever and put an end to her nightmares. Of course the Aliens, now way more than one, aren't going to be beaten so easily. And the only help they have is one little girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who is the only colony survivor and knows a little bit about the creepy monsters. Newt also taps into Ripley's motherly instincts and strengthens her for her final meeting with the hateful Queen alien and leads to the thrilling climax.<br/><br/>I don't really have to summarize the plot anymore. Let's just say that the acting in this film was superb. Michael Biehn, Lance Hendricksen, Jenette Goldstein, and Bill Paxton give great performances, and what can I say about Sigourney Weaver. She is just one of the best female action heroes that ever crossed the screen.<br/><br/>The visuals were remarkable and still hold up today, and the pacing was classic Cameron. This guy knows how to make and action film, and he also knows how to cross genres like horror and sci-fi as well as drama. He did the same thing with 1984s Terminator, and he doesn't slip at all with Aliens. A great film."
"spmshield","10","4","6","30 November 2005"," May be the best horror film of all time.
","This is one of my favorite movies ever. It is awesome. <br/><br/>When Aliens comes up on cable I still find it hard not to watch even though I've seen it over 20 times.<br/><br/>It is no longer scary for me, but it is still such a great movie and filled with great lines, especially from Bill Paxson.<br/><br/>If you want to be scared out of your pants, watch Alien 1 first, then Aliens 2, alone in the dark after a few cups of coffee. <br/><br/>In Alien 1, Director Ridley Scott uses a camera trick of leaving open space in the scene, creating a not-so-subtle expectation in the viewer that something scary will pop into the space. This of course rarely occurs, so the viewer builds incredible tension that is never resolved. <br/><br/>James Cameron starts up Aliens 2 with the same trick, but then shoves that aside for a never-ending onslaught of Aliens from all directions. <br/><br/>Aliens 3 was pretty weak.<br/><br/>Aliens 4 was better than 3, but still nowhere near as good as 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Just saw Alien vs Predator. Judging by the other comments, AVP seems to be nearly universally hated. I didn't hate it.

","My apologies to any Titanic fans reading this, but in my opinion Aliens is the best thing James Cameron ever did.  It's a tremendous thriller with excellent special effects and, in the egg-laying queen alien, the greatest movie monster of all time.  For Ripley to stand there and say her famous line, ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" (don't you just love the way Sigourney Weaver positively *spits* the word ""bitch"" at the creature?) takes the kind of over-the-top heroism that screen legends are made of.  The Alien franchise could've died with this movie -- instead, it became the classiest and most durable of them all. If it lacks the cult-appeal of Ridley Scott's Alien, it more than makes up for it in every other way."
"Elessar","10","4","6","1 March 1999"," My Favorite Film
","I was introduced to ALIENS, somewhat forcibly, by a film-wise friend in 1987; she plonked me down with a strong drink, cued the videotape, chuckled, and said something like, ""Trust me.""<br/><br/>12 years and 2 film sequels later, I'm still in her debt: the film rose to the top of my ""Fave Film"" list in '94 and hasn't dropped. With all the films ever made, between 1200-1400 of which I've experienced, why ""Aliens""?<br/><br/>1) I rarely had to suspend my disbelief, remarkable with an SF film. This could be the future; this all could happen, I felt, except for the compression of events between the initiation of the destruct sequence [for planet LV-47] and it's completion. Cameron challenged my credibility there, but hardly anywhere else.<br/><br/>2) Humans repel advanced, mightier, hostile species, despite Corporate greed, arrogance & fuggheadedness (Carter Burke and Ripley's review committee) and Military arrogance, fuggheadedness & incompetence (Lt. Gorman, and to a lesser extent Hudson, Apone, Drake, etc.). The heroes/victors?: 2 adult females (1 survivor), 1 juvenile female, 1 synthetic person and 1 adult male. Hard to get more egalitarian than that.<br/><br/>3) Crisp, believable, memorable, quotable script--a rarity and a joy in any film since the lion's share of a major film's budget went, not to the actors, but to the pre- and post-production crew (as well as the crew off-camera during filming).<br/><br/>4) Cameron's depth of research and ""world-building"" for this (and a few other) films is almost as impressive as John Tolkien's for Middle Earth. Where Ridley Scott sketched out a series of events, James Cameron built a time and place that could have thousands of plausible, interesting stories.<br/><br/>5) Cast selection, and subsequent character building, rival and perhaps top (ironically) Ridley Scott's ""Bladerunner"".<br/><br/>I echo many of the feelings and opinions other reviewers here have already written, so won't repeat them, except: I have never yet seen Aliens and felt that I'd seen it one too many times. This film's superior has not yet been created; everyone involved in bringing it to the screen should be proud to have worked on a dramatic Science Fiction-cum-Thriller-cum-Action film masterpiece."

","Twelve years ago, James Cameron made the ultimate sci-fi movie ever created. At first, it was thought that either it would be a bomb and ruin his career or be a box office hit and all the credit would go to Ridley Scott (Alien). Both speculations were wrong.  In 1986, Cameron made the most amazing Sci-Fi movie imaginable.  Adding all the aspects of a thick plot, action, suspense, terror, and realism any movie could possibly handle.  The acting was perfect as was the special effect.  At a budget of $18 million, Aliens beats even today's visual masterpieces.  After years of watching Aliens, I was able to watch the special edition and saw the sentry gun scenes as well as the colony scenes, making the movie a whole 2 hours 34 minutes long.

","Approximately the first half of this movie is really suspenseful - although the viewer who saw the preceding film already knows what the marines will encounter, and that most of them are probably doomed to die, everything is done very well and keeps us in excited expectation of the things to come. Good classic space SF meets good classic horror. However, it gets rather stale later, regrettably. There are just too many aliens and too many fights - when it comes to the last one, I think ""one more time, I saw this already, what's the point?"" - somewhat boring repetitiveness marks ""Aliens"". It's not only repetitive in itself but also in relation to ""Alien"": oh yes, we already had the airlock trick, we already had a butchered android, hadn't we? There are no new ideas here, just more or less successful variations on the original theme. Maybe some people will now think that the little girl should be mentioned. Well - she is only a hollow character. Cute, doing nothing interesting, just there to be saved and to serve as an ersatz daughter for Ripley. To me, Ripley running around to save her new ""daughter"" is too stereotypical and does add nothing to the story which is not in every poor disaster flick. It seems that mainstream movies including disasters very rarely are able to do without saving at least a pet, or a child, or both - still a bit disappointing that ""Aliens"" had to follow this pattern, too. Watching the movie, things became so very predictable. Saved in the nick of time, of course. From a dramaturgical point of view, it would have hugely improved the film and Ripley's character if the girl at least died, if she has to be in the movie at all. The cat in ""Alien"" was much less irritating... the whole movie was done with more restraint, better pacing, and - well, it had the original ideas. Still, ""Aliens"" is very watchable. But not more - it's far from being an important achievement."
"mjneu59","3","15","34","2 November 2010"," ...at least it doesn't star Arnold Schwarzenegger
","The sequel to Ridley Scott's repugnant (but memorable) sci-fi monster movie is nothing more than slick, professional, high intensity trash, with Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as the indomitable sole survivor of the earlier expedition. Here she returns to the planet of her nightmares with a company of marines assigned to exterminate the growing colony of voracious aliens, but unlike in the eerie, otherworldly original the emphasis now is strictly on cheap thrills: military firepower vs. insect acid slime. Writer director James Cameron clearly knows how to manipulate his audience: each shock is delivered on cue at a furious and exhausting pace, and every visceral effect (not to mention every line of formula dialogue) has been calculated to guarantee the proper response, whether laughter or revulsion or (says Weaver to alien threatening small child: ""get away from her, you bitch!"") a rousing cheer. The end result may be short on brains, but packs plenty of muscle; a lot of summer moviegoers apparently don't expect anything more."

","I didn't think ""Aliens"" such a very great film really, even though I'm a huge Alien-Sigourney fan. In fact I thought the second of the four to be the weakest : this really was ""America saves the universe, once again"". I know that in space, no one can hear you scream, but you could hardly miss the tough talk of the marines, who, all of them, turn out to be true heroes. I think that every existing stereotype was neatly tucked into ""Aliens"" : the tough military bitch, the tough and dumb marine, the tough but not-all-that-dumb-marine, the brave little girl, the slick commercial weasel and so on... Even the score was annoying. Now I don't say I absolutely hated it, but judging from some of the comments, you might think that this is the best space-flick ever, which it definitely is not. I'm the first to accept that Ripley has managed to say frozen for fifty-something years, but not that she manages to integrate completely in the society she wakes up in, apparently in better shape than the marines. Even the little girl (who I thought quite endearing and very natural) was a better soldier than the military guys."
"donaldking","1","25","63","1 January 2013"," Moronic sequel to ALIEN
","Ridley Scott once made a brilliant SF film called ALIEN - many years later he made an equally brilliant prequel called PROMETHEUS. In the years between, people tried to make their own sequels. One of these people was a man called James Cameron. First, he decided to make his version 'sentimental' by introducing an irritating child that kept screaming so Ripley could say dumb things to reassure it. (Fortunately, David Fincher had the brat killed off in time for HIS version.) Cameron also decided he would have the film dominated by a group of US Marines. These Marines were to have a combined IQ of about minus 5. All the Marines said things like 'Let's go!' and 'Oh my God, what is THAT?' Most irritating of all was Bill Paxton (shame on you!) - he ended every sentence with the word 'man.' Fortunately for the viewer, the aliens soon disembowelled him. The heroine of the film was to be given lines just as bad as the Marines'. The aliens were not scary, no matter how many there were. The spaceships looked second hand. After an hour of this farrago one's eyelids began to close. The Marines shot at the aliens with their huge weaponry. Lance Henriksen got his head blown off, but carried on talking. Happily, when the Marines were killed, death applied to their tonsils too. After this success, Mr. Cameron got to make a three-hour long film about a ship that was perfectly designed. It sank."
"hnt_dnl","5","13","29","5 October 2009"," Seriously overrated action sci-fi flick
","ALIENS (1986) is another example of Hollywood reeling the audience in making a bigger, splashier, flashier sequel fooling many of them thinking that it beats the original. While the original ""Alien"" was a quality, forward-thinking sci-fi film of sustained tension culminating in horror and terror, this sequel ""Aliens"" is the standard pump-up-the-volume, loud, proud, and extremely empty sequel. The dated argument is perhaps not the best one since many movies (even good ones) from the 80s appear dated now. But the best sci-fi thrillers from the 80s (Robocop, Terminator, Predator, Hidden) still to this day have something at their core that make them universal and stand the test of time. ""Aliens"" does not. It essentially is just a mindless action flick with annoying, one-dimensional characters, including the lead.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver got an undeserved Best Actress nomination playing Ellen Ripley (the only surviving member from Ridley Scott's ""Alien""). Weaver literally has one facial expression the entire flick...MEAN! I didn't see any semblance of depth or complexity to her character that would warrant an Oscar nom. She just looks like she could bore a hole through everyone she stares at. Her voice inflection is the same throughout the film, whether she's mad, happy, or sad. Basically, she is just given a lot to do to make her seem tough and brave, but most of it is very manipulative. We get the point Cameron...Everyone else is stupid and weak, but Ripley is stroooong!<br/><br/>James Cameron directs this sequel and it is nowhere near the class of its predecessor. Frozen in space for many years, Ripley is revived and asked to return to the alien planet LV-426 to act as adviser on what happened to a colony of humans. The company financing the mission uses one its top executives Burke (Paul Reiser in an actual good performance as a shifty corporate shill) to persuade her. Ripley has nightmares from her ALIEN experience. She eventually agrees in part to try to beat her demons.<br/><br/>Ripley and Burke are accompanied by an escort of Marines led by the green Lt Gorman (William Hope) and Sgt Apone (Al Matthews). The Marine grunt include Pvts Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez (Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein). Actually, Biehn as Hicks is quite good. He brings a solid, unassuming hero quality to his role. But the rest of the Marines are standard, chest-pumping, obscenity-spewing annoyances. Paxton's Hudson is the standard comic relief and Vasquez' macho-tough-girl-acts-like-a-guy character is very contrived. Also on-board is the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen in a slick, convincing performance). Of course this is a problem for Ripley after what happened to the crew in ""Alien"". Biehn, Reiser, and Henriksen are the only actors to really rise above the weak material and formulate convincing characters.<br/><br/>On the planet, the group finds that the colony has been eradicated and encounters a horde of alien creatures that they must fight off. The sole survivor is a little girl Newt (Carrie Henn, who is second billed for some odd reason; why isn't Biehn second billed?). Without barely saying a word, Newt is one of the most pretentious kids I've ever seen in a flick and her screaming is maddening...RIIIIIPLEY! As they get whittled down to just a few, in the end Ripley saves the day.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" suffers from being much ado about nothing. Beneath the action, there is really no story or strong characters. Most of the characters are cliché: the ineffective officer in charge, the wisecracking grunts who spout obscenities at each other so we'll know they have a strong bond, the kid who is smarter than the adults, the saboteur (idea stolen from ""Alien"").<br/><br/>The other sci-fi action 80s films I mentioned above all have something going for them underneath the action, mainly multiple genres working together in perfect synergy and have distinct, interesting characters. They all explore to some degree the conflict between different beings and at the end of those films, there is a provocative open-endedness and ambiguity that still resonates today. ""Aliens"" is just action...that's it!"

But after a Sci-Fi/Horror classic original, the second film is horribly dated and predictable. Cameron removes all the horror out of the film and replaces it with an all out assault on the viewers senses. He even changes Rippleys character from a sensitive but strong survivor female lead to an alpha female , who can do no wrong, including out boxing a natural predator while controlling a bulky and clumsy metal machine body crane. The first film appeals to all demographics while the second is an unapologetic attempt to appease the testosterone filled 20 year old audience.

Aliens has been described as a Viet Nam war movie in space, and this is an accurate thematic analogy. <br/><br/>Not only does it provide a very different feel, by switching the genre from the Monster/Sci-fi Horror of Alien to Sci-fi/Action/War, but it also adds exciting new elements to the Alien mythos, such as the introduction of the Queen Alien, which remains one of the best monster designs in movie history."

Combining terror and science fiction is not always a simple task, it takes some intellect and knowledge to create an exorbitantly incredible world, Aliens accomplishes that, and for terror? We need the touch of the unknown, the dread of something we know nothing, because as Lovecraft once said, the oldest fear of the human being is the fear of the unknown. Maybe few times we have felt the sensation of being trapped next to something that we have never seen in our life, but do not worry, Aliens will make us feel that in a shocking way. Ah!

","Sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi/horror films ever made—a genre so difficult to execute so wonderfully—comes along and sucks out any horror aspect that made ""Alien"" so fantastic. Instead, James Cameron replaces Ridley Scott in the director's seat and inserts sci-fi clichés and predictable thriller aspects, resulting in this overlong and unnecessary picture.<br/><br/>Cameron seems to spend a good length developing characters that are either unlikable and just there for the sake of dying, with a total disregard for driving the story forward. Even in comparing character development to ""Alien"", the sequel proves weaker. ""Alien"" was able to develop deeper and realistic characters in a much shorter timeframe, and didn't need more characters than the story required.<br/><br/>Anything new to Cameron's picture is nothing more than convenient plot-devices, thus lacking any shred of cleverness. Aside from Weaver's presence, the film hardly reminds us of the original. The film leaps too forward without any respect for its roots, totally lacking gratefulness.<br/><br/>At no point in the film is it easy to actually point out how ""Aliens"" is a necessary/needed follow up. The film may very well have worked better as it's own with all new characters and no continuity to ""Alien"", but it simply just doesn't work as a follow up; which is actually disappointing because if you want to look at what a ""good"" sequel is, Cameron accomplished it with ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". Everything on which the story stands relies on ""The Terminator"", however it doesn't need the ""remember when""s to move forward. With ""Aliens"", the story itself is not heavily relied on by ""Alien"", and again, pretty much Weaver is our only feeling of continuation. And again, given the fact that it's just a small and irrelevant reminder, the movie simply doesn't work as a sequel but rather a film of it's own. The fact of the matter is, it's not a film of its own; ""Aliens"" is a sequel, and it simply wasn't done right.<br/><br/>Was it entertaining? Sure, whatever. But upon examining filmmaking basics, however, the film fails at the follow up aspect story-wise and goes way off in a direction of its own. That's not a bad thing if it's an original movie. It's not even a bad thing for a sequel of the film shows heavy purpose in the decision to ranch off.<br/><br/>After watching ""Aliens"", if the question rose: ""Why does this particular story need to be a follow up to 'Alien'? What is it about 'Alien' that this film needs to be in the same continuity?"" The answer is that it doesn't. ""Alien"" was a successful film, therefore the studio can have a head-start at making another film by throwing in meaningless nods and references to the successful film preceding it in hopes that this film (""Aliens"") will be just as successful. Cameron probably wouldn't even be able to give a solidly confident contradiction to this claim.<br/><br/>** (out of four)"

In the end when she was captured I couldn't care less and just said leave her there (like they left everyone else).<br/><br/>I found the film a bit predictable and found myself saying 'get on with it' on many occasions.  I was also disappointed with how easily the Aliens died. In the first film part of the terror was that no one knew how to kill the creature, in this it's just a bullet away.<br/><br/>The macho interplay between the soldiers was a bit stereotypical and unbelievable and that period of the film dragged a bit.<br/><br/>I recently saw the 'directors cut' which was a lot better and cleared up a lot of the inconsistencies in the film.<br/><br/>You probably think I'm being a bit picky but I think these are a few of the issues that stops the film from become a great film and, for me, will keep it as just good."

Later when the aliens comes to them, the suspense of their hidden arrival is wonderful and as Cameron says in the documentary, he had only 6 aliens to play with! <br/><br/>Another success of Cameron is the mix of high contrasts: they are the best soldiers with the best tools and they lost the fight against the aliens; in such a violent movie, the maternal moments between Ripley and Newt shine like diamonds, all the more than this young actress is totally believable as a terrorized surviving victim The only thing that hurts me is that it's also the movie that invented the concept of bad-ass heroin, in other words, woman fighting with guns like a man! The question there is not about gender equality but the easy acting out to kill: today it's the norm but the idea that the solution to any conflict is to kill the opponent and in addition with the hands of a woman is disturbing OK Aliens are only space bugs and not really enemies but this was the 1st step into the idea of mass killing...<br/><br/>At last, the movie appears so good and excellent now that we have discovered the poor quality of all the following sequels!"
"ThunderingTim","10","4","7","20 September 2017"," Perfectly blends horror, action and scifi
","Is this the perfect movie? Well, maybe not perfect. But it is a perfect blend of horror, scifi and action, excelling in all three genres and creating a legendary flick.<br/><br/>Synopsis<br/><br/>Ripley is rescued by a salvage team after floating in space for 57 years. After being questioned by the corporation she settles into life. However, the world where the alien entered their ship is now colonized and all contact is lost. Grudgingly, Ripley goes along a group of marines as an adviser to check out the colony. After arriving, they find the place deserted. When they do find whatever is left of the colonists, they are attacked by aliens. One by one they die until Ripley dukes it out with the alien Queen, wins, and sets the survivors in cryosleep.<br/><br/>Bad Stuff<br/><br/>Erm.........maybe Newt forms a bond with Ripley a little too soon? Ripley forgives Biship out of nowhere? Why did the marines not check the ceiling of their last-stance place? Hudson can be a little annoying? Well, all of these are minor points. It's almost nitpicking. This movie has no real flaws of any magnitude. <br/><br/>Good Stuff<br/><br/>There's too much to mention, so I'll just say this: Aliens enriches Alien and the two should, if possible, be viewed in one session. Alien was a horror scifi, this adds action. All of the characters are interesting. It fixes the one bad point form the first movie, which is that Ripley really isn't that likable. But here we see another side to her, a softer side while remaining an ass-kicking heroine. <br/><br/>All the marines are cool, but Vasquez makes an especially memorable impression. She's the kind of chick you want next to you when you go into battle. She's capable, ruthless, tough as nails, handy, and oddly sexy. I like Hudson, Drake, Apone and Hicks. Burke and Gorman are assholes but at least they have some depth, some palpable reality about them. The aliens look awesome as does the whole colony. Newt is very cute. A small detail this movie does great is showing us the bullet counter on various weapons, which greatly increases the feeling of hopelessness as the marines' arsenal becomes increasingly depleted. Just like Alien, there is a hot, swampy, suffocating feel to the movie that works best when seen after sunset with the lights out.<br/><br/>Thunderin' Tim Tip: if possible, watch the Special Edition. If gives more meat to the story of the colonists and Newt. It's worth the 30 minutes of extra length. <br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>A superb mix of three very separate movie styles creates a rightly legendary movie that has often been described as having no flaws. A smash hit in theaters, a favorite of critics, and an endearing piece of film making in the eyes of the masses, Aliens has withstood the test of time extremely well, and is Die Hard's only real rival for the title of Best Action Movie ever. Because the movie does not forget to incorporate the horror element (just the look of the slimy and slick aliens is enough to pull your feet of the floor and tuck them in your blanky) and the scifi, giving us more info on the inner workings of this fascinating species, the movie feels as a tight unit, compact, a near perfect product. I love this movie and almost everyone will agree. Superb. No real flaws. It's a solid 10/10."
"PimpinAinttEasy","8","4","7","16 June 2017"," One of the greatest sci-fi action films ever made .....
","Aliens is one of the greatest sci-fi action films ever made. If the first film was horror, this one was more like an adventure. It was a lot less darker than Alien. Unlike Alien, there were quite a few likable characters. Especially Jennette Goldstein as the tough dikey soldier. Even Lance Henriksen as the robot was a lot more amicable compared to Ian Holm in the first part.<br/><br/>I think the Alien series could be a bit right wing. In the first part, you had Ripley not letting in the compromised explorer team that has brought back an alien with them. In the second part, the soldiers are not allowed to use guns while exploring the space station even though there are indications that alien creatures are coming towards them. All this because the mother corporation wants some of these aliens alive.<br/><br/>This is more of an out and out action film than the first one which relied on tense build ups. It could be my favorite of the series."
"joemckeown1990","7","4","7","5 June 2011"," Aliens
","While this sequel is an exciting action-fest, it is ultimately inferior to Ridley Scott's original masterpiece and Cameron's own earlier triumph, The Terminator.<br/><br/>Set 57 years after the terrifying ordeal of Scott's Alien, the story begins with Lt. Ripley (Weaver) waking from hyper-sleep and follows her as she defends her actions of blowing up the Nostromo all those years ago. Moving swiftly on, as this film often does, a half-hearted plot is simply a poor excuse for lumping Ripley with a bunch of extremely dumb-witted and frankly, quite boring Space Marines, as they embark on a mission to rid a local planet of the terrifying creatures that the lieutenant is all too familiar with.<br/><br/>The story in this film clearly was not the primary focus of the crew involved as the audience is made to sit through one tired cliché after another. We have the cocky marines who we know are going to last five minutes. We've got the quiet marine who is destined to be sole survivor. We've got a space shuttle crash landing and in effect trapping the unfortunate party on this desolate planet with only the Aliens for company. So far, so obvious.<br/><br/>The opening hour of this film is throw-away to say the least as this is a film which has one gear, fifth gear and when it's not speeding along it's certainly at a standstill. The real action begins as the marines infiltrate the planet and as expected, don't get the warmest of welcomes from the Xenomorphs. Cue lots of gunfire, lots of frantic camera work and lots of screaming. As the dead weight of the cast is dealt with, we are left with Ripley firmly back in charge as she leads the remaining Marines and a girl called Newt, who they discovered on the planet, to as much safety as possible.<br/><br/>The introduction of Newt is one of the stronger points of this film. It is a clever turn by Cameron as it gives the chance for Ripley's character to grow and display a maternal side that otherwise would never be explored in such a film. The performance from Carrie Henn as Newt, is one of sweet charm and more charisma than 90% of the Marines that are dragged along for the ride.<br/><br/>Other than the character of Newt, the other highlight for the film is the Aliens themselves. As typical with sequels, we get a whole lot more of them. They really are a truly terrifying creation. One set piece in particular that works beautifully is where Newt is alone in a flooded corridor as the Xenomorph is stalking her. It's a scene full of suspense as Ripley and Hicks - the quiet Marine portrayed by Michael Biehn - use a tracking device to find her only to see that she is on the floor level below them. As Hicks begins to cut through the iron railings to get through to Newt, the same tracking device begins to beep again as a vast amount of Aliens move in. This scene is head and shoulders above the rest of the film and as the Alien reveals itself behind Newt, it is done so in a way that would not have looked out of place in the sublime original.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for this reviewer, those scenes are just too few and far between in this sequel to warrant praise parallel with the original. The ending is another poorly judged action sequence involving a Queen Alien - which moves almost as awkwardly as the skeletal Terminator at the end of that film - battling Ripley who straps on a sort of dumper-truck like suit. This, for many, is an iconic scene. For me, it's as ridiculous as it sounds.<br/><br/>While this review is largely negative, that is due in no small part to the fact that it is the follow-up to one of the greatest sci-fi/horror/suspense movies ever made. If it was a stand-alone actioner, it would be praised for certain elements such as the aforementioned Ripley/Newt bond, but if it wants to wear the Alien tag then it will be reviewed in that context.<br/><br/>In conclusion: The original Alien drew comparisons with Jaws for it's suspense and more importantly, the style in which both films were crafted. Aliens in many senses can be compared to Jaws 2. Everything's bigger and bolder, but certainly not better. However, as with Jaws 2, there is some strong material, just don't go looking for something on the level of the original as you'll be bitterly disappointed.<br/><br/>6/10"

"BA_Harrison","9","4","7","12 May 2007"," The very scary and absolutely thrilling sequel to Alien.
","Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), last survivor of the ill-fated Nostromo, returns to do battle with more nasty xenomorph critters in James Cameron's blistering action-packed sequel to Alien, Ridley Scott's creepy '79 sci-fi chiller.<br/><br/>Fifty-seven years after her first encounter with an alien on desolate planetoid LV-426, Ripley is discovered in suspended-animation by the crew of a salvage ship (that finds her shuttle craft floating aimlessly in deep space). After discovering that her daughter is now dead, and being suspended from duty by her disbelieving company, she starts a new job as a power-loaderÂ—a far cry from her esteemed position as the member of a flight crew.<br/><br/>However, when the inhabitants of a terra-forming colony on LV-426 go missing, Ripley is offered her old job back (by slimy company man Burke, played by Paul Reiser), providing that she accompanies a bunch of space marines on their mission to discover what has happened.<br/><br/>James Cameron, director of the fantastic The Terminator two years earlier, does away with the slow-burn terror of the original movie; after setting up the basic premise of his film, it becomes a non-stop thrill ride as Ripley and the heavily armed soldiers investigate the seemingly empty settlement only to find it is infested with tons of toothy terrors.<br/><br/>After half of the marines are wiped out in a first encounter with the hostile ETs, and their 'drop-ship' crashes, Ripley and her team (plus a young girl named Newt who is found hiding in some air vents) try to stay alive long enough to figure a way out of their predicament.<br/><br/>With its brilliant cast (including The Terminator's Michael Biehn as hero Hicks, Bill Paxton as coward Hudson, and Lance Henrickson as android Bishop), top notch special effects courtesy of industry legend Stan Winston, and Cameron's breath-taking handling of the action scenes, Aliens is solid entertainment from start to finish. Even the 'director's cut', which is extended by 17 minutes, breezes by without a dull moment.<br/><br/>The finale, which sees Ripley protecting her surrogate daughter Newt by going head-to-head (using her power-loader, of course) with a giant alien queen is riveting stuff, and such is the overall quality of this movie I find it easy to ignore the occasional inconsistency (the acidic alien blood seems weaker in this film) or silly scene (such as Ripley successfully holding on to a ladder whilst being sucked out of an air lock with several tons of alien attached to her foot).<br/><br/>Aliens is fantastic escapist fun and a worthy sequel to the brilliant original."
"bob the moo","Null","4","7","17 October 2001"," Classic action thriller
","Starting with an excellent scare twist this film picks up years after Ripley's first encounter with the alien. It transpires that the planet where the first alien was discovered has been populated by a science colony. Ripley is sent with a military unit to discover why the colony has lost contact with earth.<br/><br/>Cameron really took a risk here in following up one of the most famous sci-fi's ever.  However he takes Scott's vision and expands it to bring in more terror and more plot.  This situation sees more aliens, more action and introduces the sub-plot that the Government would surely be keen to capture any creature capable of killing enemies.  It's a terrifying thought in itself - all the more terrifying because it is very likely to be true!<br/><br/>In terms of the action scenes the film tries to stay close to the atmosphere of the original and the terror of the aliens.  In this it succeeds, opening up what we know about the creatures and keeping the scenes darkly lit and moody.  Even though we see more of the creatures the shadows still keep the feeling of the unknown.<br/><br/>Weaver is good and is surrounded by several well known character actors (Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser) but there is little room for character development.  The fact that Ripley has slept while everyone she knows has died is not really investigated that much.  However this is a minor complaint about a classic action movie.<br/><br/>It was never going to be easy to follow the original but Cameron does a good job.  However where the original movie was a sci-fi horror movie this is a main stream sci-fi action movie with guns and explosions taking away from the horror."
"MikaelPal","3","22","62","8 October 2003"," The one that destroyed the franchise
","I must say that this was the last in the series of the four alien movies I saw. First I saw Alien 3, then the original Alien, I catched Alien: Resurrection in the theaters and finally I got my chance to see this one. I was pretty excited to finally see the film that everybody told nothing but good, but after the film... Well, I felt a bit betrayed.<br/><br/>The original Alien was more like a Lovecraftian mystery than an action film. The creature that was hardly seen and when it was seen it looked like something diffrent than your normal man in a rubber suit (ala Predator), like something that could just stand next to the ships walls and dissapear to the dark painting of gaslines. This was something that Cameron refused to understand. Propably thinking of Starship Troopers without having to pay the rights for the book, Cameron wrote the story of Aliens. Ripley, after escaping the alien in the first film, is revived after drifting in space for a long long time and is given a change to make his revenge with a group of space marines at her side. First problem with the film is the script. It's very traditional following everything taught by the ""now you can write a script too""-books. No true surprises, everybody is motivated and follows their lines with boring results. A special thanks to Gormans actor for his campy performance during the first attack. Just the fact that Siquorney was nominated for an oscar for this role makes you wonder by what standards do they choose in the Academy. The dark gothic look of the Alien is gone, replaced by Camerons ""blue""-look than can be found in his every movie. The Alien has been redesigned to look more like a skeleton than the shiny tubular biomechanoid of the first one. It's a good thing they returned to the original design in Alien3. The action is your usual Cameron. Slow, with huge fireballs.<br/><br/>Finally the idea about the Queen just destroyed the mystery surrounding the alien creature. In Alien the creature showed some strange signs by toying with its prey and propably raping Lambert. In this one, the creatures are just mindless drones thats main purpose is to kill. Thus Cameron manages to take away the horror of the original Alien. Even the facehugger gets a facelift to look a little bit less menacing. And the overhyped queen? Looking at the queen and comparing it with the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park 3 makes you just wonder if Stan Winstons studio can ever get that stutter out of their animatronics, since Jim Henson studios have been without it for years. The good things about this campy action movie? Well, there are some pretty good effect shots, like the ones of the dropship and the final battle. But in the end this film will be admired by people without the patience to look at something like Alien or The Thing. But in my mind it will always be like Commando: Funny as hell at the points it's supposed to be dead serious."
"jtwcosmos","6","5","10","15 June 2011"," Aliens (1986)
","""Get away from her, you bitch!""<br/><br/>This is the sequel to the 1979 original, Alien. It has more aliens, it has more firepower but not much else. If you're looking for a movie about boys with toys, this is it. If not, you may skip this one.<br/><br/>If the first movie revolved around people doing all the wrong things for all the wrong reasons, in this one the story is just about the same. People do stupid things, for reasons equally stupid. And to make matters worse, the writer decided to mix in the story some incompetence as well, to make things more interesting. Why? Beats me!<br/><br/>The script is bad, long and unbelievable. For example: the soldiers go into the aliens' nest armed to the teeth, but all of a sudden Ripley realizes that it would be dangerous for them to use their weapons. Everybody should just use their barbecue lighters instead, which is totally unrealistic. If a bunch of professional soldiers ever faced a situation like that, they would have just retreated and reevaluated their situation. When you are downgraded from level 245 Space Marine to level 45 Chicken Sh*t you run, you don't stick around for questions. Then the shuttle pilot lands on a planet full of dangerous creatures, yet she leaves the bay doors open. Really? Why? And so on.<br/><br/>The actors are just along for the ride, but you can't really blame them. The only one that actually felt like she knew what she was doing was the kid (and the fact that she had no business being in this movie is not her fault). The direction is decent, there is action and there are a lot of special effects. The music is average.<br/><br/>The only character that's truly incredible is the computer. If Alien had computers that could only do a bunch of ones and zeros and maybe an occasional line or two, Aliens marks an incredible evolution. Computers can now do a lot more than they could only seven years before.<br/><br/>Aliens. A good action movie, if you are willing to overlook some bad choices. 6/10."

","James Cameron's sequel, simply put, lacks the style and depth of detail of Ridley Scott's original. It's also sadly Americanized. Wisecracking Marines with big, jutting guns, cigars, and knife games. A swarm of aliens instead of one solitary killer. Ambitious, mouthy, corporate go-getters. In other words, indulgence where Scott practised restraint ...<br/><br/>And, of course, space travel has changed between 1979 and 1986. Oh, you're still put into hibernation but, in this episode, space is of little consequence, it seems. Yet in the first movie, everyone hated hibernation and space travel was a long, drawn-out trip! The crew in _Aliens_ flits about as if they're heading across town to kick some butt.<br/><br/>Seems Cameron just couldn't resist putting his personal stamp on the film (and stamping out Scott's vision). He even glommed a scene from _2001_ and stuck it right at the beginning of his film.<br/><br/>Cheap sci-fi action garbage with all the TRUE suspense taken out. _Alien_ was a higher standard than that. Cameron, you were out of your depth."

On subsequent viewings I became more aware of the levels of craft and thought that went into this ground-breaking film. So you could say I was looking forward to the sequel, but even then I had my reservations. I was right to be reticent. What I got was Rambo in space with all the levels of forethought, scriptwriting skills and character development that made films like Commando and the Rambos etc. what they were - very bad movies. The makers of Aliens missed the point of the original completely - the original alien was scary because they couldn't kill it, the characters were imperfect and real and had real fears - in this gungho rubbish the aliens get splattered all over the place and the characters seemed only scared that the director might not get their best angle. So what we were left with was less than indestructible aliens and cardboard cut-out characters from the gungho 80s - the decade not quickly enough forgotten."

The extended cut of this movie, while long, is the very best version of it. It fills in quite a few plot holes, but even the standard version is a masterpiece."

This amazing film can hold it's head up high in the most rarefied of company - ones where literally everything comes together in perfect harmony, I'm talking Star Wars, Raiders of the lost Arc, Cameron's own T2, Die Hard, The Matrix etc where everything from the cinematography to to the score is just so bang on the money. It's no coincidence that films of this ilk just don't date like their contemporaries have done. You can just see Camerons vision all over this film.<br/><br/>From the way this movie opens to the same creepy atmosphere of the original then proceeds to weave that into it's own narrative is nothing short of outstanding. The tension that builds in this is almost beyond belief, even after all these years, Aliens remains an EXPERIENCE like few films before or since. This film leaves you breathless, with an excellent (but slightly recycled from the wrath of khan) score by James Horner to boot.<br/><br/>The visuals, whilst showing their age in parts, are still really, really good - you can see the continuation of this in 'Avatar' with the big load lifters etc. It still looks great - grimy and bleak - just like his terminator films.<br/><br/>It's also full of memorable characters who nearly all get good development, humor, horror, action, and is one of the most quotable films of all time. It literally has it all.<br/><br/>I not only think it's James Cameron's best film. I also think it's superior to the still 10 out of 10 classic original.<br/><br/>It is that good."

I liked James Cameron's approach to building on perfection, and that's more guns, more gore, and more aliens. It really works well. Another plus for me is the transformation of Ripley, from a dainty survivor to an extremely strong character, and woman. The supporting cast is extremely likable and you don't want them to die but you know it's inevitable. I own the extended version and I prefer it to the theatrical version, as all the extra scenes actually have an impact on the overall film.

","Everyone says that sequels have a tendency to suck. Then there are the sequels that do not improve upon the original, but are still good movies on their own. Then there is Aliens. A sequel that is not like other sequels. Aliens is one of those sequels that is either as good as or better than the original. The film continues Ripley's story arc at exactly where the first one left off. Ripley has been floating around in stasis for 57 years. When she returns home, her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, asks her what happened. Ripley tells them the entire story which none of them believe. She is also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ripley is told that there are now colonists on the planet LV-426 which is the crew she served with found the ship from the first film. Burke, a high level representative from the company, tells Ripley that communication with the colony has stopped and convinces her to return there with marines and be an adviser. Unfortunately when they get there, the colony is destroyed and the colonists are nowhere to be found except for one survivor, a little girl named Newt. They find out that the colonists did discover the ship and everything that happened on the Nostromo is now repeating itself in the colony. This sequel was directed by Terminator director James Cameron, not Ridley Scott. But it still does not matter as Aliens has a lot of what made the first film great. H.R. Giger's designs from the first film are improved upon. That goes more than double with one of the aliens late in the film. The marines in this movie are armed with state of the weapons that can easily kill, but the film keeps all of the tension by having them completely outnumbered and at a disadvantage with them not knowing what they are up against, despite Ripley telling them earlier in the film. While there are the dumb marines, Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson either leave a lasting impression or remain quotable. Newt is not your typical kid character. Most kid characters in films get annoying, however Newt is a lot fun to watch. She is also smart and realizes that the best way to survive against the aliens is to run. The acting in the film is also impressive. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley and owns the role so much that it is likely the best performance she has ever given. Hicks, Hudson, and an android named Bishop are all played by Cameron film regulars Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen. All three of them suit their roles very well. Aliens is another one of those movies that ages so well over time. It probably gets better and better with each viewing. While Alien perfected slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs more of a punch, and features what I think is Sigourney Weaver's best performance."

","Another movie that deserves a perfect 10 stars. The real miracle of this movie is the character development, begun by Ridley Scott and perfected by James Cameron. In a few scenes we are introduced to the heart and soul of the soldier, of Ripley, of Hicks and Bishop. Why do we feel such a connection to them, so immediately, so intensely and so experientially? This is because of Cameron, and his relationship with the actors. Remember Al Matthews (As----es and elbows people!). Right now I'm beginning to think that it is the relationship, the connection, the attunement, between director and actor, that makes or breaks a great movie. Scott and Cameron understood this, and made excellent movies as a result. These days I see so many directors and actors making the same mistakes over and over again, not seeing eye to eye, and failing miserably. When will they learn? No film school can teach this. It's innate, and the stuff that makes a great director, such as Scorcese, Spielberg and Cameron. It's maddening to me, why the power of presence, unconditional positive regard and strength based direction is not taught in schools. Eric."

But they key thing is, this is done with intelligence.<br/><br/>Lots of action films have a tendency to screw up pacing; often they favor more action scenes. Aliens however excels in pacing. It's a good hour and a bit before we first lay eyes on our foes. The time before is however, very critical. Mr.Cameron made sure to maintain suspense and fear of the unknown. These aspects were critical as it was these features that made the original 'Alien' so effective and successful. Ridley Scott established in the first film, that the most frightening fear is that of the unknown. Not knowing which corner the alien could be hiding behind and only seeing short glimpses of the alien greatly increases the fear factor.<br/><br/>James Cameron retains this key rule, but makes 'Aliens' a unique film.<br/><br/>The characters are simply fantastic, with not a single cast member giving a bad performance. Sigourney Weaver reprises Ripley to great effect helping to get across her new depth. Paul Reiser plays Carter Burke to great effect. You can't help but have a certain hatred towards his character. Carrie Henn is also amazing as 'Newt' despite being such a young age. The characters that make this film however, are the Marines. The scripting is sharp, witty and hilarious and the marines lines do not fail to disappoint. Michael Biehn is fabulous as the heroic Hicks, but for me, the real star of the show is Bill Paxton as Hudson. A combination of phenomenal acting and top notch writing. In fact I dare say that Hudson could be my all-time favorite film character.<br/><br/>Overall, Aliens is an absolute masterpiece. A perfect combination of Sci-fi, horror and action. I have seen this film in excess of 20/25 times and each time it is equally thrilling. I can promise you that once viewed, you'll want a good sit down and a rest."
"tony_bee","10","3","5","19 December 2011"," Pure and Simply AWESOME!
","I thoroughly enjoyed the first alien film but this one by far exceeds the first. The story is excellent and well thought through, Sigourney weaver is excellent as 'Ripley' yet again and the introduction of the other characters fully gains your attention. The action and special effects were incredible, the aliens looked real compared even to some films now. Overall the progression from the first film is perfect. the split between suspense and action is spot on. Its hard to find ways to explain how much i love this film, but simply there was nothing i could find bad to say about the film, even the lesser characters were interesting and had meaning. Michael Biehn as 'Hicks' was a great display of acting and the relationship with 'Ripley' was enthralling. Finally some great scenes in the film for me was: the use of the sentry guns, the facehuggers attacking Ripley and noot, the final fight between Ripley and the queen alien but my favourite was the scene where the marines first fight the aliens. The scene has great suspense the use of the camera throughout the scene was great. James Cameron best director for me."

","The Alien franchise passes to James Cameron, and gets done properly. This film is everything the first film should have been but wasn't.<br/><br/>Where the first movie spent over half its length on setting things up (and even dealt with that at great and tedious length), Cameron's film smartly sets to and makes exposition part of the story. And, once the Marines are back at the planet where Ripley first encountered the xenomorph, the action never stops.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast are well defined, there is sufficient audience identification and sympathy for the audience to by fully engaged throughout, the set pieces are well done, and there is at least one brilliantly quotable line (if you don't believe me, see ""Paul"").<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver cements her place as probably the baddest-ass leading lady ever.<br/><br/>The only real criticism is that there is some grainy back projection work towards the end which is a bit unconvincing."
"bluhmfamily","8","3","5","18 December 2010"," Aliens is good, Alien is better
","Aliens is the sequel to Alien you can already tell. This movie seems more of a Sci-fi rather that Horror.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a crew finds Ripley's small ship from the first movie as it crash-lands. When Ripley wakes, the crew tells her that it is now 2094 since she was asleep for 57 more years. They also tell Ripley that the aliens from Xennomorph (the mysterious planet) are being colonized and that they will need lots of firepower for all the aliens.<br/><br/>Ripley joins the crew which is a military team goes to Xennomorph to hunt the aliens. Ripley will only join them if they are going to kill the aliens and not to make the same mistake in 2037. The team needs to be careful not to let other teammates get Facehuggers connected to them so more aliens would not come.<br/><br/>As the team battle their way though the aliens, it's just down to Ripley and a young girl. The two find the Alien Queen who is making for Facehuggers. All hope seems lost until Ripley gets into a exoskeleton suit which is later seen in Avatar.<br/><br/>As Ripley says ""Get away from her you b***h!"" she battles the Alien Queen as the two escape the alien effected base and sleep for more numbers of years.<br/><br/>I give Aliens a 9 out of 10 since this movie is more Sci-Fi that Horror."

","Typically, when you get a sequel to a hit movie, it is two things: a, very similar in style and content, and inferior to its predecessor. ""Aliens"" is neither. I originally compared ""Alien"" to ""Halloween."" If you held that same analogy, ""Aliens"" would be like ""The Rock,"" only instead of a bunch of renegade marines taking over Alcatraz, you'd have duplicates of Michael Meyers. The bottom line is that ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" could not be more different. And if I may say so, this 1986 masterpiece is a lot scarier.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) escape pod has been picked up, only for her to learn that she's been in a cryogenic sleep for 57 years. Ripley faces an inquiry, where she loses her license and because no one believes her story about the alien, is confined to a mental institution. To make matters worse, her daughter has recently died. However, a corporate guy named Burke (Paul Reiser) offers her a chance for redemption: assist a group of marines investigating a lost signal on the planet where she encountered the alien, and she gets her life back. Reluctantly, Ripley agrees...<br/><br/>This movie is tense. And when I say tense, I mean TENSE! Screaming your lungs out, shaking with fear, and sweating profusely tense. I've never seen an action movie that left me this worn out after viewing it.<br/><br/>The actors do great work. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, and this time, she's not just a stock character avoiding gruesome death at the hands of a nightmarish monster. To be sure, she does do that, but James Cameron completely revamps her character. She's scared as hell, but she's a tough cookie when it really matters. Especially when it comes to Newt (Carrie Henn), a young girl whom Ripley takes on as a surrogate daughter. Paul Reiser is a little hammy in the beginning, but he's nevertheless effective as the corporate tagalong who may not be telling everything he knows. And Michael Biehn makes for a very sympathetic Hicks, adding a little understated romantic chemistry with Ripley. Everyone else, including James Cameron regulars Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein, are very effective.<br/><br/>Once again, James Cameron has created a superlative motion picture. But instead of creating the epics we have become used to, this is a movie in top form of the kind where he made his mark on Hollywood: the science fiction thriller. It's not perfect, and arguably his weakest film. But it contains some of the most frighteningly tense and scary moments ever to grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>One of the greatest sequels of all time and one hell of a ride, ""Aliens"" is a must see for the action and/or horror lover, or any adrenaline junkie looking for a rush."
"CalDexter","10","3","5","13 March 2008"," Not only a brilliant sequel, but a classic horror thriller on its own.
","Aliens is a brilliant sequel to a masterpiece. AND it is a masterpiece on its own right. This is a film where the director James Cameron cared for the story, characters, special effects, thrills and scares like his life depended on it. It starts perfectly, just like the original, countering on the small escape shuttle from the Nostromo after 57 years have passed...one of the things that Cameron excelled on was his faithfulness to link reminders of the first film i.e. the view-screen with the dead Nostromo crew's profiles highlighted at the Board meeting between Ripley and the company executives, and the lecture she gives the marines about the crew member Kane and what happened...superb. Aliens is also action packed once the marines encounter the dreaded creatures at their lair in the sub station, the audience are gripped until the very end.<br/><br/>The performances are top class as well. Another excellent turn from Sigourney Weaver. Michael Biehn is great as Dwayne Hicks. Bill Paxton was superb and funny as Hudson. Jeanette Goldstein rocked as Vasquez, her bandanna wardrobe reminded me of Robert Shaw's Quint in Jaws. And like that shark classic, this film is a winner because you end up caring about the characters and hope that they escape from the terrible menace they face.<br/><br/>Alien is a Masterpiece. Well, that goes twice for Aliens, one of the greatest sequels and greatest horror science fiction movies ever made."
"Rautus","10","3","5","27 November 2007"," A great sequel to a sci-fi horror classic
","Aliens is the sequel to the 1979 sci-fi horror classic Alien directed by Ridley Scott, Aliens gives us something different which is sci-fi action combined with horror. Aliens is my favourite out the series because it's such a great sequel and instead of copying the first film we get a completely different style. The acting is great, the film has a great pace of action and horror, the Aliens look scary especially the Alien Queen.<br/><br/>After the events of ALIEN Ripley when into hyper sleep and her ship floated through space and now it's been picked by a salvage crew who find Ripley alive in her cryotube so they take to the ship run by the company and once she recovers she's told that she's been floating through space for years, she soon gives her story of what happened to the company but of course they don't believe her so her license is taken from her but she then learns that the planet was made livable and a colony is there, Ripley is then told a while later that they've lost contact with the people on the planet and they need her to go there since she's encountered the Aliens before, at first she refuses but then she thinks about and offers to go if they're there just to eliminate them not to capture and study.<br/><br/>While they wait to reach the planet Ripley meets some of the Marines, and while having dinner Bishop does his famous knife trick but cuts his finger where Ripley sees the white android blood and asks Burke why a android is with them but the Marines always send a android on a mission but Ripley doesn't like him since Ash malfunctioned and tried to kill her and was working under company orders. Soon they land on the planet and the Marines go in, all they find is acid burns. No humans no Aliens just what happened, soon they find movement but discover that it's a little called who calls herself Newt, Ripley makes friends with her. The Marines soon discover movement in a part of the complex so they go down in there while Ripley, Bishop, Newt and Gorman observe in the vehicle, soon the Marines find the bodies of the colonists cocooned to the walls, they find one still alive but soon the Chestbuster bursts out and they burn it but this alerts the Aliens and soon a huge firefight breaks out with most of the Marines getting killed by them.<br/><br/>Gorman starts to crack under the pressure so Ripley takes the wheel and drives to where they are, Hicks, Hudson and Vasquez manage to get into the vehicle and then Ripley quickly drives off while some of the Aliens still attack, Ripley manages to escape but Gorman gets injured so someone else needs to lead them and that's Hicks. They're only option is to destroy the planet but Burke doesn't want this but they still do it, the ship to pick them up gets destroyed when an Alien sneaks on board and kills the people in it, now they're stuck on the planet with just a few hours before it explodes. They barricade themselves inside the place and put a few sentry guns around, Bishop comes up with plan to remote control the pick up ship on the Marines ship so he goes through the tunnels to connect the remote link up while the others try to stop the Aliens from getting in, Ripley takes Newt to bed and promises that she'll protect her then she meets with Hicks who teaches her how to use their weapons, she then goes with Newt to get some sleep and when she wakes up she finds her Pulse Rifle gone and two containers with the Facehuggers in open, another problem is that the door is locked and soon her and Newt try to stop the two Facehuggers.<br/><br/>Ripley takes out her lighter and triggers the fire alarm alerting the Marines so they quickly jump to action and rescue Newt and Ripley also killing the two Facehuggers. Ripley tells them that Burke was going to impregnate her and Newt so that the Company would have the two Aliens, he would also sabotage the Mariens cryotubes. Then suddenly the power goes out and they barricade the doors where the Aliens could come from but soon as they get even closer Hicks checks the ceiling to discover loads of them climbing about then suddenly a huge firefight begins as the try to hold off the Aliens, Burke runs off and locks the door, Hudson shoots at them but the floor underneath is broken by the Aliens and he's pulled down. While they try to open the door Burke locks another and opens to next to find an Alien in the next room and it kills him. They then go through the vents as the Aliens start to break down the other door. As they're moving along Vasquez gets attacked by an Alien and although she kills it she gets badly burnt so Gorman goes to help but they get surrounded by the Aliens so they blow themselves and the Aliens up with a grenade. Meanwhile Newt gets captured by the Aliens and it's up to Ripley to try and save her before she becomes a host.<br/><br/>Aliens is a great sequel and a sci-fi classic made by legendary director James Cameron.

","Well I think a lot of other users have summed up my feelings about this film.<br/><br/>I actually saw aliens before alien, after a lot of people has spoken about it in the playground. It was a premier on ITV over Xmas in 1990-1991. It was one of the first scary sci-fi i watched and it gave me nightmares! Classic characters such as Hicks, Hudson etc. Excellent direction from James Cameron. The only thing is that some of the effects have dated a little bit (not the creature effects though).<br/><br/>Also the portrayal of a elite military unit seems very undisciplined, which is something Cameron says he wishes he could address in his DVD commentary."

The acting is superb, the effects stand the test of time and the story has me on the edge of the seat even though I must've seen it 30 times.

"timcarter152","10","3","5","24 October 2007"," This film demonstrates just what a sequel SHOULD do
","The following review is my... oh God, don't tell me that I've already lost count! <br/><br/>The Positives: -The acting is superb throughout the film. I don't feel the need to go into how great Sigourney Weaver's performance is, considering that she got an Oscar nomination for it (unheard of for the science-fiction genre). Also of particular note is Carrie Henn as Newt. It's too bad that this was her only film appearance, considering how deftly she avoided joining the long list of annoying children in grown-up movies (even with all the screaming she does). -The movie (very thankfully) avoided becoming a rehash of the first film, instead opting to become more of an action film with thriller, horror, and sci-fi elements mixed in. And boy, was James Cameron (the director, for those ignorant people who don't already know) ever successful! After the first hour, which serves as setup and character development, the film becomes an extremely intense, frightening thrill ride (sorry for sounding like the critic from Maxim magazine). -The visual effects hold up very well, even though the film was made in 1986. You can hardly (if at all) notice any of the puppetry, stop motion, or models. It looks realistic. On a different note, the sets and atmosphere also contribute greatly to the film's success.<br/><br/>The Negatives: -The Marines seem a bit too jokey at times, but considering how much better the film is with the humour they contribute, you can't honestly cite that as a problem.<br/><br/>My 3 choice words: Intense, B**ch, Newtastic"
"valleyboiS","10","3","5","19 April 2007"," One hell of a white knuckle ride from start to finish!
","This was the first alien film I watched and is the reason I become obsessed with the aliens verse. I was 10 years old and can remember sitting with my dad (another big aliens fan) and watching this film for the first time (on a old VHS taped from the telly).From the opening shocker of Ripley's dream to the pulse racing confrontation between the queen b***h and Ripley, I was glued to the screen. Even though i had not seen the original i immediately sympathised with Ripley and was amazed at how the new cast were extremely likable and important to the story. No line of dialogue is wasted in this film. This film is so quotable and have had a big influence on movies and other media (just check the original halo to hear multiple quotes ripped direct from this film).<br/><br/>The film starts with Ripley the sole survivor of the nostromus space ship from the first film being awakened from hyperspace after 57 years. Soon she is sent back to the planet this time armed with high tech gadgets and an army of marines. This time though there are hundreds of aliens not just one. An important scene not in the theatrical cut gives the films second half more meaning and Ripley's motivation more sympathetic and understandable. I suggest if watching for the first time to get a copy of the directors cut, it adds so much more to an already brilliant film and even with an extended run time of 147 minutes you won't be bored.<br/><br/>The casting for this film is perfect. Again Weaver gives a ground breaking performance unusual for a horror film. Cameron indulges her character development in this film as she befriends a young girl and their surrogate mother/daughter storyline is beautifully done with very limited cheesiness. Ripley is also beefed up a bit in that she now comes equipped. What bloke (or woman) doesn't get excited at seeing Ripley in her vest top with a flame-thrower, pulse rifle and gun strap equipped and ready to face a terrifying nest of aliens. Carrie Henn who plays newt is also very good in her role and it a shame that she quit acting after this film. Paxton is awesome as Hutson and delivers some of the best one liners of the film. Michael Beihn is also very likable as Hicks. My favourite side character has to be the tough but likable private Vazquez brilliantly acted by Jeanette Goldstein. Special nods go to Burke and also Bishop, the former played brilliantly as the slimy corporate bigwig with a hidden agenda, whilst the latter plays his character with a creepy edge, making his motivations MD actions in the film non-predictable.<br/><br/>I like the direction Cameron took with this sequel. Instead of trying to mimic alien with a new cast (which i heard is what fox wanted originally intended) he takes a completely different direction with more action but still presenting horrifying situations for the characters. Despite the heavy emphasis on action there are plenty of thrills and 'jump out of seat' moments in this sequel. Particular mention goes to the med lab scene when Ripley and newt find themselves locked in with facehuggers and when Ripley descends into the alien nest alone. <br/><br/>Il stop talking now. If you haven't seen this film then what are you waiting for, and while your at it make sure you watch the others. Both alien and aliens get perfect scores from me and whilst the sequels don't quite reach the same heights you will want to continue to see how Ripley's story ends.so to some up, amazing story with surprising depth and heart for the genre it sits in,special effects that were out of this world for the time this film was made and a site knuckle ride from start to finish. An essential film that deserves the acclaim it gets. Plus sigouney was nominated for best actress at the Oscars for this, a rarity for sci-fi. I still watch this now and love it just the same as I did all those years ago."

Additionally the film is filled with many brilliant memorable moments, backed by an excellent soundtrack and Cameron's nightmarish set-design.<br/><br/>Sigorney Weaver and Michael Biehn are only two people in the extremely talented cast which is just quirky enough to be memorable, but not so much that it would distract the viewing experience.

","The first film was impressive, scary, and had my heart racing with adrenaline. This film carries the same intensity as its prequel, but this film broadens with not only its spookiness, but also with its amazing grandeur of of a new leap in visual effects. In its time, the first film had great effects, not to judge, but it was a bit on the hokey side. But with this sequel, even in my opinion till today's standards, it has awesome visual effects.<br/><br/>The director, James Cameron, easily among the most inspiring directors of all time, captures such a story like aliens with a combination of horror, and visual effects that look real and captivating. Sigourney Weaver, plays once again as Ripley, delivering an even better performance than the first, which she received an Oscar nom for.<br/><br/>Awakening 57 years after the events from the first film, she learns that colonists have lived on the alien planet for sometime. But when humans loose contact from them, Ripley is sent in to lead a high-tech squad of soldiers to find what had happened to them. She is followed up with an all-star cast, such Bill Paxton, Michael Beihn, and other cast members as the hot-headed, overachieving, and rather humorous band of soldiers, and Carrie henn plays the adorable and cautious Newt, who is the only surviving colonist.<br/><br/>With her case, she and Ripley develop a strong and believable, relationship, of similar individuals in similar circumstances. Once again, the Aliens films prove to be among the most intense sci-fi films ever brought to life. It's a great sequel that towers over its prequel.

","I agree with almost everything from Paul Kydd's comments, except one! Yes, Aliens was and still is a great movie, and with hindsight, and particularly after we've seen what dross we've been served up with parts 3 and 4 it looks even better, but and its a big but, ALIENS DOES NOT SURPASS ALIEN!!! I remember seeing Aliens for the first time and believe it or not, it did not make that great an impression on me, and the reason is ALIEN and ALIENS are two different movies. Having already seen Alien I was not expecting the adrenaline pumping action of Aliens. After seeing it countless times since I have warmed to it and come to realise what a fantastic job Cameron did in creating what is one of the best sequels in any movie series.<br/><br/>So there in lies the problem, 2 great, but different movies.

"Hellrazr360","8","3","5","16 February 2006"," One Of The Biggest And Best Sequels Ever
","It's certainly hard to talk about sci-fi movies and not bring up Aliens. James Cameron's sequel to the 1979 horror classic Alien is not only superior to its predecessor but it's among the greatest sci-fi movies to have ever been released.<br/><br/>Aliens picks up where Alien left off, only it's been over forty years, and Ripley's been in cryo-sleep the whole time. After a not-so-friendly meeting about what happened in Alien, Ripley is revoked of her license. Then she finds out that the inhabitants of a colony that landed on LV-426; the alien planet have gone missing. Ripley, by her own will, chooses to go with a group of marines to hunt down the disturbance. As you might expect, things get pretty sticky and tight in Aliens as there's more than one, a lot more.<br/><br/>James Cameron puts an action emphasis on Aliens unlike Ridley Scott's horror direction for Alien. And it's this that Aliens does so well, being a great action movie along with some thrilling moments. Not only does this change in direction make Aliens a more exciting film but also a better film. It's not just that the action in Aliens itself is great, but also that Cameron went for an original approach for the action attitude rather than make another horror-focused movie.<br/><br/>There's also some great actors to find in Aliens. Sigourney Weaver of course returns as Ripley and she's much more serious than her character in Alien, so yeah, she's pretty bad-a** now. You've also got Micheal Beihn-who played Kyle from the Terminator as Corperal Hicks, and Beihn once again does a great acting job. Then there's everyone's favorite marine from Aliens, Bill Paxton as Hudson. You of course have to love Paxton for giving Hudson some of the best one-liners like ""Oh that's great, that's just f**,king great, now what the f**k are we supposed to do? We're in some real tight s**t now man!"" Once again, I have to talk about the action itself in Aliens, as it's so impressive and fun to talk about. I could mention so many awesome scenes from Aliens but the one that I love the most are the sequences with the Alien Queen. I must also give kudos to Cameron for the scenes of the Alien Queen against Ripley in the loader, which just flat-out rocks! The magnitude of Aliens was and still is excellent and huge.<br/><br/>If you ever find yourself in need of a perfect Saturday-night sci-fi movie, Aliens will work ever time. It's just one of those movies that you don't get tired of watching, ever. Thank you James Cameron, for making some of the greatest movies of the 80's and 90's, Aliens was a true accomplishment!"
"TOMASBBloodhound","9","3","5","6 November 2005"," Equal to, but much different than the original.
","Aliens is without a doubt one of the better sequels ever made. The original film, directed by Ridley Scott was more of a horror film which took place inside a vast cargo ship out in the vastness of space. Aliens, the first big budget venture from James Cameron, is more of an action film. It's filled with shoot-outs, explosions, and has a much larger cast. Most of the action takes place in tight quarters as a group of intergalactic marines battle an army of ""xenomorphs"" which has wiped out a colony on the planet where the crew from the original film first encountered them. The film is relentless as the embattled humans try to ward off the superior numbers of creatures, and escape back into space.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific. Sigourney Weaver is back to play ""Ripley"", the only surviving member of the cargo ship from part one. She and her cat have been drifting through space for 57 years before being rescued. She has not aged due to the hibernation process which is used to transport people on long space voyages in these and other space-oriented films. She tries to adjust to life closer to Earth on a space station, but it isn't easy. After a while, contact is lost with the colony which has been set up on the distant planet where the creatures were discovered. Ripley is sent out with a team of tough-talking marines to investigate, since she's the only person who's seen these creatures and lived to tell about it. This big, evil company she works for always seems to be protecting these creatures, and they probably figure this mission would be a good way to get rid of her along with the expendable marines.<br/><br/>Some of these marines (the ones who live past the first 45 minutes) are a hoot. Bill Paxton pretty much rode his character to stardom. Michael Biehn, who replaced the troubled James Remar, also fills out his role nicely. All of the soldiers are upstaged by Jenette Goldstein, however. She's a James Cameron regular who plays the toughest marine in the unit. Right down to her last scene, she's outstanding.<br/><br/>The set design and production values are incredible. The weapons and equipment these soldiers use looks like it could really work. Cameron's attention to detail is well on display in this futuristic world. You can see why studios would later grant him so much money to make movies. The $18 million it cost to make this film wouldn't even cover the catering on one of his films now. Aliens grossed about $80 million in theaters and has made countless more dollars in the home market since its release.<br/><br/>There is one BIG plot hole that prevents me from giving it a perfect score, though. I don't know if anyone else caught this, but there is a problem with how the people in the colony discovered the alien ship. We are led to believe that Paul Reiser's character sent the colonists out to the ship and they became impregnated with the creatures. But wouldn't the colonists have found that ship already? Surely every inch of that planet would have been mapped out before any colony was built! And what about that beacon which led the cargo ship in the original film to the site? Wouldn't the colonists have also heard this beacon? I know this script was monkeyed around with for years, so any explanation of these glitches may be out there somewhere........<br/><br/>9 of 10 stars. The Hound."
"thephotorepairman","10","3","5","20 August 2001"," Action and adventure galore!
","If you saw ""Alien"", now that was horror.  I can't put ""Aliens"" in that genre.  What I saw was non-stop action and adventure, suspense and drama in a science fiction setting.  The aliens were not invincible.  Ten times as many aliens died as marines.  Paul Reiser  was wonderfully sleazy as the villain.  No tears were shed for him!  Sigourney Weaver (Rippley) is tough as nails in a soft-hearted way.  Is that possible?  The rest of the cast make for Xenofodder with the exception of Michael Beihn and the android, Bishop.<br/><br/>To me the defining moment was the shuttle sequence.  The pilot did not scream or cry as the crew from ""Alien""  did.  She died going for her gun.  The special effects of the crash were spectacular.  The aftermath of the crash devastating.<br/><br/>I share the same opinion as many that this sequel was the best that was ever done, and far surpasses the other three movies in this series."
"TheGuru-4","10","3","5","22 June 2001"," A *perfect* sci-fi film!
","This is my #1 all-time, most favorite, most watched movie EVER! Need I say more? Hmm ok. James Cameron is a genius and his directorial mastery is most evident here. Forget Titanic and Terminator for a second and let's discuss ALIENS. For a movie that is 15 years old the special effects still hold up even today - that is just amazing. Never did I doubt the reality of the movie or the possibility of aliens such as those in the film actually existing. This is a film that will give you nightmares. You'll care about the characters because they are ALL likeable and fun. There's more one-liners than a Schwarzeneggar movie here too, talk about the quotage! The music by James Horner is also first rate and heart pounding. It's also a testament to pacing and intensity that the last hour of the film is filled with so much tension and drama that you will feel worn out by the time the credits roll. And get this: Sigourney Weaver was nominated for Best Actress for her role. How many action/sci-fi movies get acting nominations? Virtually none. Check this movie out, don't even rent it, just BUY IT immediately on DVD."

","Perhaps the best praise in a review is brevity. This is the single best science fiction film ever made.<br/><br/>Cameron is an obsessive genius, with a fixation on detail and obsessive consistency that makes Lucas and Spielberg look like a couple of Troma interns. The ""hard"" special effects, executed by some of the best in the business on carte blanche budgets, are what make the current digital state of the art look fake. The acting is on target and the story is dark, cerebral, inventive, and as utterly believable as it is fantastic. A standard is set here which has never been matched since - this movie makes the Matrix look like a bad Barney episode. I must warn you, seriously, that once you see this, you will be ruined for other science fiction forever."

"M-and-A","3","11","29","17 February 2009"," Much praised, but why?
","Average imagination and average aims must be the combination behind this alien sequel. To take an example near the beginning, the capsules where the spaceship crew sleep are shot three times over from a very boring perspective (the foot of the beds slanted in a row to the left, the edge of the first bed slanted to the right); or, when part of the crew are investigating a tunnel where aliens might be hiding, the two men and a woman are pictured from the front, at the knee level, as in a tourist photograph.<br/><br/>These ordinary camera angles would not matter, if the director was not only interested in technology but also people. But besides Sigourney Weaver's Ripley we have vehicles for one-liners. I just appreciate it if several people in a film are given some character: it does not have to be more complicated than, say, the four different old men in Clint Eastwood's ""Space Cowboys"" (2000). Also, I failed to notice any special amount of humour, which some say is there. Regrettably, Cameron's alien is just a competent action film, with good acting by Weaver."
"hall895","4","7","17","8 October 2013"," Another overrated ""classic""
","The first Alien film is considered a classic but I didn't particularly like it. This sequel is also considered a classic and I like this one even less than the first. At least the first one had a little tension. This one is just a shoot-em-up action thriller. See Aliens, shoot Aliens. Repeat as necessary. This makes for a thriller which is not particularly thrilling. Things get rather repetitive and monotonous. The film can't surprise us, we already know what the Alien is, what it's capable of. This time there are just more of them.<br/><br/>The film picks up with our heroine Ellen Ripley awaking from a 57-year nap. While she was dozing a human colony has been established on the planet where she encountered the Alien all those years ago. In an amazingly convenient plot contrivance contact with that colony is lost soon after Ripley wakes up. Gee, what could have happened? A reluctant Ripley is sent back out into space with a team of Colonial Marines to investigate. These Marines are, by and large, idiots. They get to the colony. Surprise, nobody's there! Oh wait, they do find one survivor, a little girl who spends the rest of the movie screeching ""Ripley!"" at the top of her lungs in exceedingly annoying fashion. Speaking of annoying the most idiotic of the idiotic Marines is Pvt. Hudson, played in excruciatingly terrible fashion by Bill Paxton. With this character we're talking Jar Jar Binks levels of annoying. Just shut up. Please. Every time this guy opens his mouth you dearly wish an Alien would turn up and devour him.<br/><br/>In the first film Ripley was not the only character you cared about. There the rest of the crew, with one notable exception, were sympathetic figures as well. No such luck here. There's one guy, Corporal Hicks, who comes off reasonably well. The rest are a collection of morons, jerks and slimeballs. With an incredibly annoying child thrown in to boot. Sigourney Weaver does the best she can, turning in a solid performance as Ripley. But she gets precious little help. Michael Biehn is pretty good as Hicks and Lance Henriksen has some good moments as an android but everyone else is quite terrible. Paxton goes way beyond terrible, he is truly wretched. The story, such as it is, doesn't thrill you. The movie takes its sweet time getting to the Alien planet and once we get there it's just a shooting gallery. Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. Eventually we come to the big finish. Here the movie does have some surprises for you if you haven't already lost interest. But ultimately this ending, like everything which precedes it, falls flat. The climactic battle is visually impressive but really quite silly. Honestly you can say that about the film as a whole. It looks good but the story is a dud. Genuine frightful moments are very few and far between. Suspense is sorely lacking. Characters say and do some of the stupidest things. And an Alien apparently knows how to work an elevator. Going up? No, this movie is going down, crash-landing with a thud."
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","10","4","8","8 February 2019"," The best action sci-fi horror war movie my number 1 personal favorite film of all time hands down
","Aliens (1986) is a masterpiece one of the best action sci-fi horror war films of all time hands down. I love this movie to death it is my personal number 1 best action sci-fi-horror movie that I love to death. In my opinion this is James Cameron best film ever don't get me wrong I love The Terminator, I love Terminator 2: Judgment Day to death, they are both my personal favorite James Cameron films because Cameron is a legend I appreciate him. The same time my personal favorite films of all time will always be Aliens and Rambo: First Blood Part II because James Cameron wrote the script for it. It is a bad-ass film and I wrote a war because this time is war in the planet LV-426 Platoon of US Space Marines fights against Aliens.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people compere this film to an action and sci-fi genre but doesn't compare to horror genre. There's plenty of horror in it: the opening scene the dreams sequence in which Ripley has a nightmare and we see Ripley been cocooned from one of those Alien creatures in her stomach that was scary sequence in which her cat Jones start hissing and creeps me out every time I see it. The creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay that is horror sequence.<br/><br/>I love James Horner's music score for the movie which is his best soundtrack ever, who is no longer with us anymore. R.I.P. you are missed.<br/><br/>I love all the characters: Ripley, Newt than the marines: Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Lieutenant Gorman, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe, and Private Wierzbowski I love them all in this movie and they are memorable.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, who travels with a platoon of US Colonial Marines to investigate a loss of contact with the colony established on the same planet discovered by the crew of the Nostromo in the original film<br/><br/>I love the action, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) finds the Alien nest, saves Newt (Carrie Henn) destroys all the eggs of the Alien. Battles with the Alien Queen one-on-one she gains a new daughter, when her real daughter was dead. Ripley comes back to colony LV-426 to face her fear once and for all so that she want have any nightmares and she and Newt will be safe. We have Bishop here a synesthetic android, he saves Ripley and Newt. Lance Henriksen is excellent as Bishop I love him in Hard Target (1993) and I love him in here to death.<br/><br/>I love Michael Biehn as Corporal Dwayne Hicks this is my favorite role of the actor he played. I love Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) he was the best, rest in peace I really miss you. Ellen Ripley is a bad-ass warrior Sigourney Weaver was the best in this movie. Carrie Henn as Newt was the heart in this film.<br/><br/>I love this film to death, I am cherishing with all my heart. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc and I am constantly watching it. I used to had the DVD version but I trade it for Blu-ray because of the better picture quality, better special features and the DVD cut scenes from the film away even the special edition did that. DVD did not had any special features at all. 10/10 my personal action, sci-fi, horror masterpiece war movie of all time I love ""Aliens"" to death!"
"ElMaruecan82","10","4","8","12 November 2018"," Add an ""S"" to a classic and you'll get another classic...
","Ridley Scott had set the bar so high with his groundbreaking ""Alien"" No one thought a sequel would be a good idea. Those were the times...<br/><br/>Why a sequel anyway? The first Alien was history, Ellen Ripley was the lone (human) survivor and getting back in that doomed rock wasn't the smartest move. Much more the film was a modern horror classic and any attempt to recreate the claustrophobia of the Nostromo would have induced more déja-vu than jump scares. Paraphrasing the original tag-line, a sequel would've been ""'Jaws 2' in a spacecraft.""<br/><br/>But Canadian director James Cameron wasn't a newcomer in the mid-80's. ""Terminator"" had thrilled the audiences with a simple concept: an indestructible machine set to kill a girl next door (literally), a nightmarish ride with no other option than fighting and the sweet Linda Hamilton turning into a match to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Basically, Cameron told a story with a familiar David vs. Goliath structure and character's arc, his 'Alien' was the Terminator and his 'Ripley' was Sarah Connor.<br/><br/>And I think I can recreate the whole brainstorming that shaped the sequel. I guess the first question echoed the purpose of the sequel: what is scarier than an alien? Two aliens or how about a colony, or how about a human colony invaded by the aliens who need human for incubation purposes. Then all you have to do is find a way to justify how the colonization of the « alien » planet took place without taking Ripley's warning into consideration. Then all you have to do is let her drift for as many years as it takes, even if it means losing her family, her daughter... and she might find a 'daughter' figure in her mission. Of course, they'll need Ripley who's the only human being to have encountered the Alien, but since she's the only one to know how dangerous they are, how about spicing it up with a corporate prick who'd love to bring an Alien to Earth... do we need a treacherous android again ?<br/><br/>See, the most complex stories can originate from a simple question which happens to be the right one. At the end, we have the plot that became a staple of the action genre, a group of hardened soldiers of various experiences and levels of bravery assigned to a supposedly routine mission (a 'bug hunt') with only two people who know the real stakes, Ripley obviously, and Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) as the slimy executive who managed to make himself more detestable than any Alien. It's a smart demarcation from the original where the secondary villain wasn't human (by the way, I wonder if it's a coincidence that 'Burke' is the sound of disgust in French).<br/><br/>The casting also includes Michael Biehn the unsung hero of ""Terminator"", the late Bill Paxton as the easily-freaking-out one, William Hope as the inexperienced Lieutenant, Lance Herrikssen as Bishop the android and scene-stealing Jennette Goldstein as Vasquez, the real female badass. There's also Boggs from ""Shawshank"", a cigar-chomping sergeant who goes too soon, a few forgettable faces and Carrie Henn as little Newt. Her military salute to a panic-stricken Paxton is one of these moments that make the film more than a formula picture. If it's full of establishing moments and typical wisecracks in the beginning, once the the chips are done, three-dimensional personalities are unveiled. And there's a reason why I insisted on Vasquez' being the badass one.<br/><br/>Again, Sigourney Weaver plays Ellen Ripley in the humblest and most pragmatic way, she's involved because she hates the Aliens, she knows what they're up to, and nuking them is the only option. She's not a military officer, no gun expert, yet because of the Marines' inexperience, two-faced Burke and her promise to never abandon Newt, she becomes the only one capable to defeat the Aliens, not because of fighting skills, but because she has a protective instinct, an intuition for the right moves... and sometimes, a lighter. Ripley is like a more experimented version of Sarah Connor, triumphing over her fears until the unforgettable Power loader moment and the climactic line.<br/><br/>The only match for Ripley was a ""witch"" indeed and that was decades before strong women became a marketed trope. Here, the film culminates with the fight between two Mama Bears, when the Aliens are all defeated and there's still the Queen. So we had aliens in tunnels, we had the glowing dots, we had a face-hugger trapped in a room (and I could relate to it since I'm scared when I suspect a cockroach in a bathroom), we had flamethrowers and grenades and acid flushing all over faces, a race against the clock, but the ending fight is just the Chantilly on the cherry on the cake.<br/><br/>To be honest, I initially thought the last hour was so intense it was like an overdose of adrenalin, and I was pleasantly surprised to see Ebert sharing the same view. I saw it again, and I was amazed that this was made with no CGI, that the story was riveting and the characters appealing. I said ""Alien"" was a masterpiece of suspense while the sequel was a great action movie, in fact, ""Aliens"" might be the ultimate action movie and a masterpiece of suspense as well, earning seven Academy Awards, including a surprising nomination for Sigourney Weaver. Unlike the first two ""Terminator"" movies, the film didn't join ""Alien"" in the Thrills list, but Ripley was also named eighth heroine in AFI's Top 50, not bad for a sequel... but even 'sequel' is too feeble a word to describe how powerful ""Aliens"" is.<br/><br/>To think that all Cameron had to do was adding an ""S"" to get a classic makes it even more legendary.All it took was adding an ""S""..."
"TheBigSick","Null","4","8","12 September 2017"," Even better than its predecessor
","James Cameron is just a born genius in filmmaking, who always improves the sequel over the original film. ""Terminator 2"" is better than ""The Terminator"", and here ""Aliens"" exceeds ""Alien"". So there are reasons to expect that ""Avatar 2"" is upgraded from ""Avatar"". <br/><br/>First of all, the visual effects are improved in ""Aliens"". In ""Alien"", due to the technology limits, only part of the alien is shown to the audience. But here in ""Aliens"", a full-sized alien is filmed. Secondly, the emotion of ""Aliens"" is stronger than that in ""Alien"" because of the new character Newt."

","Aliens is a bit different than the first Alien movie, it has more action and it has lost its mysterious, horror character.

If we compare it to the other movies from the Alien anthology we'll see that this one has the most action. <br/><br/>The movie also shows us a relationship between two of the characters - Ripley and Newt. Ripley has recently found out that her daughter has died while she was in hyper sleep. This loss is very painful for her and when she meets the little girl Newt she manages to establish a parent - child relationship with her. Ripely protects the girl, even though she's not her biological daughter.

"PeachHamBeach","10","4","8","22 December 2014"," Megatons of FUN
","LOTS OF SPOILERS. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS FILM, DON'T READ THE REVIEW!!!<br/><br/>This is many peoples' fave of the ALIEN franchise, and with good reason. It has a deepening of Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) character (if you watch the version with lots of restored footage), more info about the girl Newt (Carrie Henn) and how she came to be orphaned and a lone survivor of a colony of over 100 people called Hadley's Hope, and lots of great characters. The prequel to this film had a pretty small cast and felt claustrophobic at times, but ALIENS seems to move more briskly, even though it's set on the same planet.<br/><br/>Boy, Weland-Yutani must be the epitome of evil, greedy, petty corporations. Nearly 6 decades after Ripley and Jonesy went into stasis after destroying the first Alien, this bunch of bureaucratic turds are STILL mad that she blew up the Nostromo. The oh-so-generous jerks decline to press criminal charges against her, but they revoke her license so that she has to start her life over again working at a crappy new job. Barely back on earth for a few weeks or so, she gets a knock on her door from one Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser, before MAD ABOUT YOU) and an inexperienced Lt. Gorman (William Hope), who leads a corps of Marines. They practically beg Ripley to accompany them to the planet LV426 because suddenly the terraforming colony overseen by Weland-Yutani Corp. has not been heard from in a while and nobody can raise them. Suddenly, Ripley's account of the fearsome, acidic xenomorph seems to be a likely factor. <br/><br/>Among the many memorable characters are Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn, who is loved worldwide for his portrayal of this and his character in THE TERMINATOR), a low key, levelheaded marine who has to take over once Sarg Apone is killed, the obnoxious and hysterically funny Prvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton, another all time favorite of mine for 30+ years), Prvt. Vasquez (played by another Cameron/Bigelow regular, Jenette Goldstein, a wonderful chameleon of an actress), and the benevolent android Bishop (Lance Henriksen, yet another Cameron legend) who is nothing like the devious Ash of the prequel.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the entire colony, save Newt, has been destroyed. As I learned in the sequels, these aliens use humans not only as hosts with which to reproduce, they kill and use them for food as well. In the very first battle, most of the marines are slain, or worse, kidnapped and made into hosts for the facehugger parasites that hatch from eggs, leaving a handful of survivors. Their mission a bust, they attempt to leave the planet and make plans to ""nuke the site from orbit"" to ensure the annihilation of this hostile species. Suddenly Mr. Burke is very vocal about his opposition to these plans, and it's not long before he is revealed to be yet another corporate pig with greedy plans to get rich. He is the true villain here, and worse than Ash, because Ash was an android programmed to do what he was told.<br/><br/>Many harrowing but action packed battles later, many of our survivors are no more, and we finally meet ""the bitch."" Enough said. I had very high hopes about the ending...but I was in for an unpleasant surprise in the next installment of the franchise. Perhaps my 2nd favorite Cameron film. 10 stars."

","Since this movie was directed by James Cameron, I knew I'm going to like it and I wasn't disappointed. This movie is much better than the first part. First of all it's more realistic, all those spaceships and Aliens looked very realistic even compared to a nowadays movies. Also, I noticed that the similar robot which Ellen Ripley was controlling, also was used in The Matrix Reloaded, only in Aliens it looked more realistic. This movie was more creepy and intense too.

"pauloggs","6","5","11","18 May 2008"," great action film, poor alien film
","SPOILERS For me this film merited only six stars because I felt it took the Alien franchise in completely the wrong direction. If it had stood on its own it would have received a much higher rating.<br/><br/>I understand why so many people here reviewing this film gave it top marks; it's action-packed, the acting is good, the storyline interesting, with excellent special effects and a dialogue that was filled with memorable quotes. But I can't help comparing it to the first film, and feeling that Aliens wasted an opportunity.<br/><br/>In Alien it was suggested that once you leave the safe confines of the solar system, space can be mysterious and hostile in the extreme. Out there, species and technologies exist that are completely incomprehensible to us. Set against the grubby realities of pay disputes and faulty equipment, crew discontent and bickering, the sight of the utterly bizarre organic derelict is actually a real shock, and the subsequent appearance of an eyeless, brutal nightmare is equally stunning, and leaves you wondering just what else is out there lurking amongst the stars.<br/><br/>In Aliens, the aliens become dumb canon-fodder, and have lost all the potential suggested by the first film's 'perfect organism'. In a way it took the franchise in the wrong direction, which we can still see repercussions of to this day with appalling duck-hunting that happens in AVP Requiem.<br/><br/>This is a real shame because as one reviewer here said, Aliens is a great war/action movie. It packs in some good storyline elements - the overconfident military summarily humbled; the inexperienced lieutenant falling in at the deep end; the wonderful interaction of the marines etc.<br/><br/>But why waste the potential themes suggested by Alien by developing the story in this wise-cracking shoot-em-up way? Why not develop the alien as being potentially intelligent? Explore the connection with the derelict more? (I suggest the excellent site www.planet-alien.co.uk as a fresh look at the whole Alien theme).<br/><br/>And much of this second movie felt contrived.<br/><br/>In the original, Ripley was just an accidental heroine - it could so easily have been any of the other crew members who survived. This made Alien feel believable and heightened the tension. In Aliens, her heroine status is a crowd-pleasing and key part of the plot, and you know she is going to be indestructible. At the back of your mind you know she will survive because the studios will make more money from a Weaver sequel than, say, a Goldstein sequel. A poor theme repeated in the films that followed. How is it that she outperforms trained soldiers here to save the day?<br/><br/>Another example is the alien queen. In an attempt to trump the original film and add something new, Cameron fell back on just using a bigger and badder monster to keep people interested. If he had made Alien 3, would his End-of-Film monster be 100 foot high?<br/><br/>And picking LV426 as a colony planet is just an unconvincing plot device to get back to the scene of the action. Why pick a hostile, cold, atmosphere-less, rapidly-rotating hole of a planet, as far away as 'the outer rim', as a good spot for a colony?<br/><br/>Cameron felt it necessary to repeat the following clichés:'chest-bursting', 'alien mouth punching through heads', 'acid blood effects'. This set a trend for the rest of the films of this series, as if there were now an unwritten law that subsequent directors must use this, this and this from the original film. An extreme example is Alien Resurrection, when the alien activates the frozen gas button to kill the worker with its mouth - why not just press down with its hand?<br/><br/>As a stand-alone, Aliens would have been a great film, but as a development in the Alien storyline it was poor."

","Back in early 20th century, Lumière brothers didn't have a clue of what they were playing with.

In that sense, but in the best way imaginable, 'Aliens' is the atomic bomb."
"davidmvining","10","2","3","26 November 2019"," The best example of Bigger is Better
","There are several ways to approach making a sequel to a successful genre film. One of them is ""bigger is better"". James Cameron's 1986 Aliens might be the textbook example of how to do that.<br/><br/>The movie follows so many of the same basic plot points and character models as the first that it could almost be called a remake. A group of working class people land on LV-426 where they are attacked by aliens, killing everyone but a few. The few fight back, thinking they've succeeded before a final fight erupts on the escape ship. Having won, everyone goes to sleep in freezer pods for the long flight home.<br/><br/>I detail that not as a criticism, but only observationally. Stories work because of execution not because of basic plot details, and Aliens is executed marvelously.<br/><br/>Ripley, having survived her first experience with the xenomorph on the Nostromo, has drifted through space for 57 years while in cryo-sleep. She gets picked up and returned to the Company who nurse her back to health and debrief her about her experience. No one believes her experiences, though there's enough interest to get the colonists on LV-426 to check out the coordinates Ripley supplied. Of course, the Company loses contact with the colony immediately afterwards and they have to go in. Ripley gets roped in and tags along with a group of Colonial Marines. They find the colony deserted save Newt, a little girl hiding in ducts, before all hell breaks loose and the xenomorphs come calling, tearing apart the marines one by one.<br/><br/>You can see the ""bigger is better"" mentality running through that. The setting is bigger (a colony instead of a small ship). The group of people is bigger. The type of people are bigger than life (space marines versus space truckers). The weapons are bigger (rifles and grenades versus makeshift prods and flamethrowers). The number of aliens is bigger (one versus many). There's even the introduction of a new type of xenomorph, a much bigger Queen. The film embraces bigger in every way, and in doing so it fundamentally changes the nature of the horror that was present in the first film.<br/><br/>Cameron was smart enough to understand that by changing the scope of the threat (from one alien to many) he was changing the type of horror present. The first film was essentially a claustrophobic survival horror film. Some of those elements are still present in the sequel, but they're far less prominent. The sequel is still a horror film, but it's changed subgenres from the haunted house to an action horror film. That change is perfectly cast for the change in scale of the threat.<br/><br/>It also makes sense from a practical perspective. In the first, the xenomorph was untouchable, but that was an element of the crew's unpreparedness. Sending in marines with big guns changes the relationship between the characters and the threat. The aliens could have been made invincible, but that might have been too far in the suspension of disbelief department, so increasing their number was probably the most logical choice. Swarms of aliens that you can't see until it's too late replace a single entity that could be around every corner. That also requires another extension of the aliens in the form of a new type of creature, hopefully bigger, and the queen fits the bill exactly. She's huge and terrifying.<br/><br/>Moving on to thematic material, Aliens actually continues Ripley's journey instead of just repeats it. If Alien was about the destruction of a family, Aliens is about recovering from trauma by forming a new family. Ripley can't sleep through the night because she's so consumed by nightmares of her past experience. It's the reason she goes on the mission to begin with. She thinks that by confronting what hurt her, she may free herself of her own fear. Finding Newt, the little girl, gives her a purpose beyond her own survival. Newt becomes Ripley's daughter (a connection made more potent through a deleted scene that's included in the Special Edition of Ripley's actual daughter cursing Ripley for leaving her alone her whole life), and Corporal Hicks takes on the mantle of father and husband to the pair.<br/><br/>The final act of the film is entirely predicated on the newly formed family being threatened and torn apart. An alien grabs Newt and takes her to another part of the colony to be impregnated with another alien. Ripley has to go in herself, leaving Hicks behind in their escape ship because of his injuries. It becomes one mother (Ripley) against another mother (the Queen), a symmetry between the two characters that adds an extra thematic oomph to the final act. It plays with much more character that way instead of just bad assed woman going up against a large creature.<br/><br/>The real final fight on the Sulaco where Ripley gets in her mech suit and has, essentially, a fist fight with the Queen is one of the most gratifying and visceral special effects driven fights in popular film. It's mother against mother after Ripley destroyed all of the Queen's children. The fight is perfectly filmed and completely believable, giving Ripley the kind of physical advantage that is both believable and satisfying.<br/><br/>The movie's just pure action horror entertainment that's very smart about how it uses its characters to establish themes that feed into the terror. It's bigger, louder, and with many more explosions, and it's probably the best example of bigger is better filmmaking."

"eagandersongil","7","2","3","17 May 2017"," Less terror, more action
","After 7 years, ""Alien"" is back, this time brought by another great director, James Cameron, shifting the focus of the movie a little, bringing it from terror to action, but still without losing its origin completely. With an apathetic script, where we have a situation to bring the legendary lieutenant Ripley back to action, even though not being extremely creative, the script never gives in to ridicule, on the contrary, it takes itself seriously and we take it too seriously. 57 years after the events of ""Alien"", Ripley returns to the planet LV- 426 to help families who explore the place, this time accompanied by a troop of soldiers, the ""Aliens"" end up being underestimated ... With less terror and more Action, the script still pleases. Technically the film is exquisite, having the face of the 80's, but better done, packed with visual effects that appeal to this day, James Cameron does well. Lastly, ""Aliens"" is a good continuation and a natural evolution of Plot, characters and context, but will never have the charm and impact of its predecessor."
"runamokprods","8","2","3","27 November 2014"," A lot of tense, scary fun
","It's interesting to compare Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" to James Cameron's sequel. Both are extremely well made films, from world class directors. But each also reflects the very different sensibilities of the two. ""Alien"" is colder, more precise, more haunting and disturbing. ""Aliens"" is a thrill ride from start to end, faster paced, more muscular and energetic, less serious, and sloppier – in ways both good and bad - than it's progenitor.<br/><br/>It sometimes pushes the emotions into the 'sappy' range, one of it's few flaws, along with a few big logic holes, and a couple of obvious twists. But the film-making is so confident, and downright fun that it becomes infectious, even if you try to resist it. It can make the 'gee- whiz' kid in you win out over the critical adult. <br/><br/>The plot in some ways is a re-run of the first, but now instead of humans being helpless victims, they are Marines going to war with a creature they don't understand, and initially don't take seriously enough. <br/><br/>There's also a nice feminist streak to the film, present in the original, but expanded on here. Not only is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley tougher and smarter than just about every male on display, but the most kick-ass of all the kick-ass Marines is also a woman (Jenette Goldstein in a terrific performance). <br/><br/>I enjoyed Cameron's extended cut (his preferred version) on the blu-ray. The newer version didn't feel too long, but did feel more flowing and complete, giving us some important insights into Ripley's character. The blu-ray's image is terrific and very sharp, but that does tend to show up the crude nature of some of the early CGI work. I was also bothered by how much of the film seemed as if the dialogue had to be re-recorded in post production, the 'looped' dialogue somehow sounding a bit un-natural. <br/><br/>If not a 'great' film, a very enjoyable, tense action blockbuster, back when solid acting, clever writing and high end craftsmanship were still important, even in a sequel."
"Hitchcoc","10","2","3","31 August 2010"," A Masterpiece of Suspense
","This is a fantastic film in every respect. While the original was outstanding, this takes it to new heights. Everything is set up so well. The bad guys in the futuristic corporate world are at it again. They know of the horrors but see people as cannon fodder for the the venomous aliens. Ripley's character is mature and smart. Throw in the little colonist and a group of overzealous (and frightened) Marines and you have the ingredients for one of the best. The story is extremely well plotted. Every single thing that is put in front of us serves a purpose later in the film. The byplay among characters and the actions of the shortsighted bureaucrat all work. The combat scenes with the aliens are intense and frightening. The work in the first movie is drawn on to create this second one. It isn't the slipshod sequel, made to make a few bucks on a previously successful movie. The aliens have now become a silly franchise. This was the real thing. Don't bother with the other stuff."
"kenjha","8","2","3","27 December 2008"," More the Merrier
","As the title indicates, this sequel to ""Alien"" is literally more of the same. The plot is pretty much a rehash of the first film except that there are more characters and instead of a spaceship, the aliens do their terrorizing at a remote outpost in space. Cameron is good at this sort of thing and he keeps the action moving at a rapid pace while sustaining the level of suspense. On the negative side, it goes on a bit too long and the parallels to the original show a lack of imagination on the part of the writers. Weaver is fine reprising the role of Ripley. Reiser makes a good villain. Paxton provides the comic relief as a cowardly marine."
"Craig88","10","2","3","21 April 2006"," best Alien franchise film by miles
","Aliens has got to be one of the best films ever made. The non stop action and plot is fantastic as are the actors.Hudson rules! Aliens begins where Alien left off. Ripley is in cryogenic sleep on the escape pod from the destroyed Nostromo.She is found by a deep space salvage crew and learns she has been asleep for 57 years.After fruitlessly explaining her actions,alien and so on from the first film to 'the company' they inform her that LV426 has since been colonised and the colonists haven't complained of any 'hostile organisms'. Then of course they lose contact with the colony and Ripley joins a group of hard a** U.S marines to go find out whats happened.From then on the film goes into ultra a** whooping mode with aliens ""coming out of the god-damned walls"" left,right and centre. The cast in Aliens is absolutely perfect.Sigourney Weaver is as hard as ever as Ripley which actually got her nominated for an Academy Award. Michael Biehn is the cool and collective Corporal Hicks,while the other hard a** female,Vasquez,is awesome with her gun that is probably taller than her! Paul Reiser is great as the slime ball company man Burke and Lance Henriksen is perfect for the role of the android Bishop. But for me hands down the best character is by far Hudson played fantastically by the so underrated Bill Paxton.How Paxton didn't win an Academy Award for best supporting actor is beyond belief for me.Hudson is as he says ""the ultimate bad a**"" when in fact he is probably the most scared out of the remaining survivors.Hudson is given the best lines in the film and it pays off as his comedy relief/hard a**/scared character are spot on.Some of his brilliant lines include ""game over man,game over!"",""there's something moving in here and it ain't us"" and ""how do i get out of this chicken s**t outfit?"" and many more.If this role had gone to anyone else but Paxton i don't think that the film would have that extra something if you catch my drift. Aliens IS the best film of the Alien franchise hands down and probably one of the best sequels ever made.It was fast,furious and funny.One of the best action films ever made and why wold,t it be?With James Cameron (terminator 1 and 2) at the helm it was bound to be. I strongly urge that you watch this film even if your not that keen, just watch it for Hudson's sake,the bloke will have you in stitches. RATING-10/10"
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","2","3","30 October 2004"," Aliens have returned in spectacular fashion!
","Aliens avoids the all-too common fate of sequels, to live forever in the shadow of their predecessors, and usually for good reason. It is especially common for sequels of enormously successful movies to fall flat, particularly in the horror and science fiction genres (remember The Exorcist II?). The first sequel to Ridley Scott's spectacular 1979 film, which set the standard for science fiction for years to come, is placed into the capable hands of James Cameron, who clearly takes some knowledge from Halloween director John Carpenter. Once this movie gets going, it goes full speed and doesn't let you rest for two and a half hours.<br/><br/>The movie starts off exactly at the same point where the first movie left off. Well, 57 or so years later, but otherwise the same. Ripley has been in deep sleep and drifting aimlessly in space, and was discovered, as one man describes it to her, by dumb luck. She wakes up to a series of significant and inevitable shocks. Her daughter, whom she had promised that she would be home from her mission, the one from the last movie, has grown up and died an old woman. It's a strange scene to see Ripley looking at a picture of her daughter, now decades older than her own mother.<br/><br/>It's not long before Ripley learns that the planet on which they found the strange craft with the alien eggs in it is now inhabited by an entire subculture of families, living on the planet in order to cultivate the atmosphere so that it will be breathable for more people to go live there. Needless to say, she's not entirely impressed with the idea of families living on the planet where the aliens came from, but these people have a lot of money invested in populating that planet, so no one's going to call off the whole project based on the ramblings of some woman who has been floating in space for five decades. And there you have the premise for the movie, already having justified its existence and separated itself from its predecessor enough so that it owns the rest of its own plot. Many good sequels still only tell another story under the same basic plot outline or involving the same characters. In this one, only one character remains from the original story, and the rest of it is simply a continuation of the original story. James Cameron later went on to develop something of a reputation for making good sequels. <br/><br/>Alien fans can rejoice because they made another movie but did not sell out. There's a big risk in successful movies being followed up with a sequel just for the money, you see it all the time  Predator, Texas Chainsaw, Darkman (Durant survived that helicopter crash???) etc. Aliens starts right off knowing that it's not wise to throw in another alien and film it chasing and killing people. The movie starts out with Ripley facing serious consequences for official misconduct for that expensive ship that she destroys. She has to convince the board that she had no other choice at the same time as she has to credibly explain the deaths of her entire crew and convince them that those families living on that planet, LV-426, are in grave danger. Not only are they skeptical of her story, she's a suspect in a criminal investigation.<br/><br/>Suddenly, all contact is lost with LV-426, and Ripley's story begins to take on a little merit. They offer her a clean slate if she'll accompany their military forces to the planet to check out the situation. She agrees as long as they are going there to destroy the alien, not capture and study it. There is an interesting new crew in the movie, except in this case Ripley has to convince them of her reason for being there. She's not combat trained like they are, but she knows what they're up against, and it's not until they learn about that that they begin to realize how important she is to their mission.<br/><br/>My favorite is Bill Paxton's character, Pvt. Hudson, a tough-talking, loudmouth showoff who is reduced to a whining baby, just about wetting himself with fear when the group is confronted with the alien. He was the toughest talker and the loudest mouth going into the mission, but the first to give up hope on himself and the entire crew. This is one of the ways that the story develops unique personalities, people that we can identify, if not identify WITH, just enough to care about what happens to them. And in a movie like Aliens, it's very important that the audience cares what happens to the characters. <br/><br/>When they get to the island, it's not long before they encounter a young girl named Newt, who has survived when the rest of the planet was decimated by the aliens, and doubts the crews ability to fight a growing number of aliens with such a small force, and Ripley takes her under her arm. Ripley becomes the mother that Newt no longer has, and Newt becomes the daughter that Ripley no longer has, and it sets an interesting tone for the rest of the movie. The aliens are trying to protect their offspring, and Ripley is essentially trying to do exactly the same thing.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes the Alien movies so successfully tense is the setting. They are enclosed within a ship in outer space, trapped with a much more powerful creature. If both sides were unarmed, the aliens would do away with the humans in minutes. Cameron uses this setting to its full potential, employing motion sensors to heighten tension and using spaces in the ship, like the space above the ceiling, to allow the aliens to get extremely close to the humans, even while the humans are watching their movement on their monitors and wondering why the monitor shows them in the very room but they can't see them yet. <br/><br/>In another lesson that Cameron seems to have taken from John Carpenter, he keeps the aliens mostly out of sight during the movie, feeling that the less we see them the more menacing they become and remain. He's exactly right about this, too. It maintains a sense of mystery and danger surrounding the aliens that transcends simply their viciousness and obvious physical superiority, and always keeps the viewer straining to see more. But like the crew, we know very little about these creatures other than how deadly they are. Oh, and if you want to see what happens when a director doesn't understand the need to keep the killer in the shadows, watch Halloween II. <br/><br/>This is, unfortunately, the last movie in the quadrilogy before it makes a precipitous creative turn downward with the sub-par second and third sequels, but Alien and Aliens are spectacular enough that they fill the void left by their two predecessors. Two such powerful movies may make it even more difficult to take that the good ones seem to be over, but these two remain landmarks. Also keep your eye out for (among several other Cameron regulars) Jenette Goldstein, a lesser known actress whose impressive versatility becomes clear when comparing her character in Aliens with her character, say, in Titanic!"

","57 years ago Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was part of the Nostromo spaceship's crew that encountered a terrifying alien, as the last remaining member of the crew she has drifted through space in hyper sleep. Awake and alive nobody believes her, so she is asked upon to support a Colonial Marine outfit as they go back to Moon LV-426 - a now colonized moon where the original Alien came from. They have recently gone dark and potentially abandoned the moon, and the authorities want to know why. The Colonial Marines are outfitted with state of the art warfare machinery and an arsenal to potentially deal with any threat.<br/><br/>This is an amazing film - on par, if not better than the first in the series. It takes concepts from the first film, and then changes the approach and dynamic of the plot - expanding the universe in which the story unfolds. Some sequels just re-hash what came before them; this takes the original and does an A-Team transformation on it, attaching guns, lasers, nitro, bells and whistles. The end result is a genre bending action horror sci-fi chase war thriller masterpiece. There are explosions, special effects, gorgeous cinematography and mise-en-scene, great plot, thrilling story, top actors delivering excellent performances, scares, frights, fights, character development - oh believe me, I could go on singing the praises of this film. When James Cameron was given the reigns to this after Ridley Scott's seminal ""Alien"" film a lot of film-goes where dubious - but given the proof of the ""Terminator"" movie, Cameron had the pedigree to be successful and boy did he deliver! Not just a tour-de-force of a visual spectacle, but also a film lecturers dream as the material further promotes lots of themes and discussions - none more than the heroine who is the vehicle for plot. If the first film made people look at Sigourney Weaver differently, this film went a long way to elevating her star power as she totally flipped action hero conventions on their head - to this day her performance is still synonymous with being a major player in the change from masculine dominated cinema. The matriarchal bond shown between Ripley and Newt is great, the character development goes some way to showing an attempt to fix the fragility of the broken bond exemplified at the start of the film when it becomes clear that Ripley's own biological daughter is resentful of the unjustified absence of a mother. Another well documented discussion this film birthed deals with the parallels to war films, and in particularly Vietnam themed war film - however rather than shoehorning academic thesis' into this review I'll just say that the film did more than just entertained, it became an icon in cinema.<br/><br/>I seriously cannot give this film less than 10 out of 10. It scared, thrilled and entertained me as a child when I watched it (admittedly under the legal age), and it still keeps a smile on my face as I watch it as an adult."

Cameron's at his very best here, and so is hollywood movie-making for that matter. And to judge from most of Cameron's later movies (""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" aside) you sort of get the idea that maybe he was told to just ratchet down the scary-good movie making a notch and quit raising the bar so high for everybody else.<br/><br/>I can't say anything that somebody else hasn't said in their review by now, except that I wish there were more movies like this, and it makes me sad to realize that more movies of this caliber are and will be rare and far between, probably forevermore."

"TxMike","Null","1","1","16 August 2017"," The second in the ""Alien"" series, part of a 30th anniversary BD set.
","The year 1986 was when I moved my family from the New Orleans area to Texas. A career move to a new job and I don't recall ever seeing this move back then.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to 2010, a re-release of all the first 4 ""Alien"" movies in one complete set on BluRay disk, along with two extra disks of extras. A total of 6 BDs. I found that my local public library has the set and I now have watched Alien (1979) and today I watched this one. Picture and DTS sound are excellent as we have come to expect for BluRay.<br/><br/>I watched the extended director's cut which is about 2 1/2 hours long and it never seemed too long.<br/><br/>In the first movie Sigourney Weaver as Ripley barely escaped the Alien after the rest of her crew were systematically killed. She put herself and the ginger cat into hibernation, not knowing for sure where she would end up.<br/><br/>As this movie starts we see her escape pod captured by a larger space vessel and when she awakes finds that she had been asleep for 57 years. During that time her young daughter grew up and died. But then during the debrief sessions no one believed her story, they could not detect any trace of alien tissue and accused her of incompetence.<br/><br/>However that same far-away moon had been settled with a terraforming operation and now over 150 people were residing and working there, including some families. When a normal communication from the site is missed a team is assembled and sent to investigate.<br/><br/>(Aside, we see them go into the hibernation pods, later to wake up, but are not given any hint of the actual transit time. It must be a very long time, but no more than a few years.)<br/><br/>When the team arrives all they find is devastation and a few dead people in pods that the aliens used for their growth. Plus one survivor, a small girl of about 8 years old, dirty and scared and hiding out. She is first-time actress Carrie Henn as Newt. She and Ripley eventually bond and their mutual survival becomes the focus of the story.<br/><br/>Paul Reiser is good as Burke, representing the business interests of the operation and ultimately wanting to save his own skin. Lance Henriksen is good as the emotionless robot Bishop. Bill Paxton is a bit ""over the top"" as Private Hudson, always either wisecracking or being scared out of his wits.<br/><br/>A really good, tense movie, most viewers rate it clearly about the seed movie Alien.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: For my recollection, with lots of bullets, fire, and explosives they manage to escape from most of the aliens, but with many casualties. In the end only Ripley and Newt are alive when they come upon the ""queen"" alien, the large one laying eggs, Ripley thinks they get away from it but find it in the escape space ship and she has to once again figure out a way to eject it into space, and blowing up the manufacturing site to kill all the remaining aliens. With difficulty she does it and she and Newt go into hibernation pods as the movie ends."
"tankace","9","1","1","14 February 2017"," Be afraid be very afraid ,o wait wrong film, but still true.
","Aliens is one of the best sequels in film history for it took the Lovecraft inspired terror for : 1) continued to the horror elements almost excellently and 2) made it a pitch perfect action-film with awesome scenes, effects and many more!<br/><br/>The film takes place sixty years after the events of the Alien, with out ""s"" in the end and we see Elen still recovering from the shock of the film now is been task alongside a battalion of space-marines to investigate some issues with the colony, which has been made on the moon of the first film. And then the marines find out that the enemy is way out of their league and it becomes a race for them to escape.<br/><br/>What I am fan of Aliens is that it makes it clear that humans had it coming for the arrogantly settle a unknown place and with just brute force can fix the problems there. But as they say in Greece ""You make plans and God laughs at you!"" and we see something else : the hubris of Ancient Greece ,the sin of too much arrogance and bolt actions with out thinking first. And Cameron has stated that he draw inspiration of the Vietnam War for the theme of ""The Big Bad Marines biting more than they can chew"" .Ok that is one nit pick of mine with that film, but I won't blame the directorial team ,but the eighties for film which had some kind of conflict ,usually used the recent then experiences from that war to show how bad was the situation in the flick. Alas if it is done nice I am unable to crumble about it and here it also the case. <br/><br/>One other pros of the film is the effects, gore ,practical all that good stuff which I love from action films of the eighties, because they are real, the actors can react in and with it and so their job is made a lot easier to be what they must be in the studio. Which in this case is people in a hostile environment.<br/><br/>Also Sigourney Weaver is awesome in her role and I consider her role as Rirley and she continued the long standing tradition of strong female characters in Cameron with the likes of Sara Conor and Neytiri. For if you think it for a moment the majority of leading female characters in action flick is only by him , Tarantino and George Miller if you include Fury Road (Which I do!).<br/><br/>In conclusion if you haven't seen it, what were you doing in the last three decades? Go watch it and if you are a man and have a girlfriend ,then watch it with her to show her that you appreciate women for more that their looks!"

","I do not like horrors. But watching Aliens was great. First up, Aliens really is not a horror. Its predecessor, Alien is clearly a horror film and its two successors, Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection are too. Even though the original films prequel, Prometheus is not very scary, it is still meant as a horror and so is its upcoming sequel, Alien:Covenant.<br/><br/>Aliens is terrific. It uses silence and normal sounds terrifyingly. Even when nothing is yet happening, the feel of terror is so big that the moment the aliens attack, is not even half as scary. The film itself is great and I love it. Sigourney Weaver is a great actor and James Cameron, the films writer and director, is definitely a genius."

Usually kids in a monster movie don't work out, but here it does.<br/><br/>Why I like Aliens more than it's source material Alien, because you saw how a single xenomorph was powerful, and now seeing an entire race of them and they're awesome queen is just amazing. <br/><br/>If you want to see this more than Alien, you don't need to see Alien, even though Aliens is the sequel.

","Aliens is James Cameron's best movie. At least the theatrical cut. <br/><br/>While I have soft spots for Terminator and T2, I like the Abyss more than most, Aliens is the best movie he will ever make. The Extended edition isn't really worse per say, but there is a distinct lack of suspense and mystery by the time we arrive at Hadleys Hope. <br/><br/>Not only is this James Cameron's best movie, this could be one of the greatest, if not top tier, of all action science fiction movies ever done. Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, the cast of Marines and even Lance Henrikson have so much personality to carry the story which actually doesn't amount to much. You don't care and you don't have to because the people, not necessarily the Aliens, really do carry this one. <br/><br/>Even with some kind of low budget and an apparently antagonistic film crew could stop this from being awesome. I know there's some admirable things for the first movie. Stylistically, Alien still holds up. While it may not be a cucumber sand which, Alien still does not hold a candle to its sequel. Aliens is suspenseful, supremely constructed kinetic entertainment that never leaves you bored. There really isn't an Alien franchise. There's just Aliens and the other movies. Game over man."
"Rickting","9","1","1","21 December 2016"," One of the most exciting films ever
","Aliens is an absolute blast in every way. The franchise goes from horror to action, as Ripley joins a team on a mission to find out what happened to the colony on the moon where she found the alien egg. Alien was a good movie, but I consider Aliens to be superior. Aliens has absolutely everything: it's got great acting from everyone including the child actor. It has a very entertaining script with fascinating war themes and excellent character development for all of its characters. It's brilliantly directed and is one of the tensest and most terrifying films of all time. The action is staggering, but there is some drama here as well. Ripley may have been awesome in the first film, but here she cements herself as pretty much the best female movie character of all time. It's difficult to choose the best moment of the film as every moment moves the film forward and every scene, even the dialogue ones, makes you feel like you're on a high-speed roller coaster flying off the rails. It gets exhausting occasionally, but only because the sheer intensity of the film is an utter knockout. James Cameron's greatest film and something of a masterpiece. <br/><br/>9/10"

","Anyone who had the privilege to see this film in theatres knows that Aliens is one of the funnest rides in film history. ""Alien"" was a great accomplishment and a very good movie as well, but its horror and suspense takes a long time to develop. It centralizes on weak, pretentious characters that make it so you don't care whether they live or die, taking away from the potency of the film. Aliens cuts all of the *beep*. In Aliens, Weaver essentially acts as a female ""Rambo"". The badass weapons, set design and crazy, previously unthinkable action sequences make Aliens the insane roller-coaster ride through monsters in space that it is."

"avik-basu1889","7","1","1","1 January 2016"," Aliens vs Guns !!!
","'Aliens' is the 2nd film in the Alien film franchise and probably the most popular film in the aforementioned franchise. Written and directed by James Cameron, this film begins after the events in Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Ripley survives after her escape vessel is recovered after drifting across the galaxy while being in cryogenic sleep for 57 years. On Earth, no one believes her story about the events on the planet LV-426 which she experienced and she loses her licence. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation had already ordered the colonisation of LV-426 during Ripley's extended absence. But suddenly all communication with the colony gets lost and the company decides to send a team of tough, rugged, space marines to investigate the situation along with Ripley to help them with her knowledge. <br/><br/>James Cameron did something exceedingly brave when he decided to practically change the genre in the sequel to an immensely popular original film. While Ridley Scott's 'Alien' was sci-fi horror with elements of tension and claustrophobia, Cameron's 'Aliens' even though it still retains some of the slow tension building in the 1st half, is basically a straight up action blockbuster which makes it much more accessible to the general masses. It has the 80s written all over it. This film raises the stakes and makes everything bigger and louder than 'Alien'. There are explosions, there are machine guns, and this time instead of one, Ripley along with the other marines faces a whole army of Xenomorphs. The film again looks beautiful and the visuals hold up on Blu Ray. Cameron's craft as a director can't be doubted after watching this. Cameron holds the tension in the first half and then bombards the viewer with one brutal action set-piece after another in the second half.<br/><br/>When it comes to the themes, Cameron actually retains the theme of the ill-effects of capitalism that was a part of 'Alien'. But although this capitalism angle does appear in 'Alien', Ridley Scott was a little more subtle, while I felt Cameron went a bit overboard to drive home the evil corporation element in the storyline and at times it became slightly unrealistic. Another element is of course feminism. Ripley, I believe becomes the true action hero in this film more than in 'Alien'. She overcomes all the naysayers above her in the hierarchy and truly owns her power and evolves into a truly powerful woman. We also clearly see strong themes of motherhood running throughout the film which again is handled in a slightly overt way. But there also hints at racism in the script and this racism theme I think is what Cameron handles the best with the requisite amount of nuance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film didn't have the lingering effect that 'Alien' had in my mind. I preferred 'Alien's subtlety over the big and blockbuster feel of this film. The grand scale of the action sequences in this film genuinely makes 'Alien' look like an indie horror film. But I thought the endless action sequences although very well directed in the end to some extent diluted the overall effect and at times went into ridiculous territory. The film also has a number of endings like 'Return of the King'. There are also certain relationships that are forged in the course of the narrative that made me correctly predict who is going to live in the end and who won't. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is absolutely brilliant in this film. She richly deserved the Oscar nomination. She conveys every emotion possible in the film be it frustration, love, anger or fear. She also completely commits to the role and becomes a compelling action hero. Ripley evolves from the role of indefatigable survivor in 'Alien' to the role of the tough, bad-ass mother in this film. Although most of the characters in 'Aliens' lack the realism and are not as believable as the Nostromo crew in 'Alien', but they are entertaining and funny. I'll give a special mention to Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and Michael Biehn. <br/><br/>'Aliens' is a film that I can enjoy a lot and watch over and over again. But every time I do, it somehow fails to stick in my mind for too long due to the over-dependence on action sequences. It is a big 80s action film that is one of the best of its genre, but still in my eyes not as deep and satisfying as the original film in the series."
"lucasversantvoort","8","1","1","5 May 2015"," A great, action-focused sequel, but lacking in horror
","After Ridley Scott's Alien had broken new ground in 1979, the sequel was inevitable. This one, which hit theatres in 1986, was spearheaded by a different director however, James Cameron. His career was just picking up steam, having directed The Terminator two years earlier. As a standalone film, Aliens is pretty good. As a direct sequel to Alien however The story picks up where Alien left off. Ripley—and her cat—are drifting in an escape pod when another ship recovers it. She's saved and back on earth. There's a committee willing to hear Ripley's story, and like all on-screen committees, they don't believe a single word. However, when all communications are lost with the colony assigned to investigate the alien site, the company decides they might need Ripley after all. And since Ripley's being haunted by nightmares every single night, she thinks confronting her fears might be the best option. She joins a group of 'hardcore' colonial marines and they head off to planet LV-426 to find out what happened.<br/><br/>As I said, as a standalone action flick, I mostly like Aliens, mostly. Though some of the events and dialogue are clichéd, it's usually Sigourney Weaver's acting that kept me fully immersed. I think it's also got something to do with her outfit. I mean, a leather jacket in an 80s action flick? Pff, it's on.<br/><br/>One of the things I like the most is the slow build-up. The whole film tends to feel 'grounded'. It's not about going from one overblown action set-piece to the next, but to make you feel like you're standing right next to Ripley and the others, experiencing their panic, trying to figure out the best course of action.<br/><br/>Other things like the relationship between Ripley and Newt are also pretty well done. Whenever the action cools down, the film takes its time to let their relationship develop. The same goes for the romance between Ripley and Hicks which is, thankfully, mostly suggested and implied, though the symbolism gets way too obvious in the scene where he's teaching her how to handle 'guns' *wink, wink, nudge, nudge*. But overall, there are no hands wiping a steamy window à la Titanic. Instead, there is a mutual connection based solely on their ability to remain cool, calm and collected under extreme circumstances.<br/><br/>The film also mostly looks good, mostly. While the space scenes remind one of how incredible 2001—a film made in 1969—still looks, the aliens themselves still look as detailed as they did in Alien. It's pretty mindboggling how James Cameron and his team made the aliens look so good with only roughly a third of the budget Alien³ had.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a good action film and I enjoyed it a great deal. Despite the film being ridden with clichés, the was still a genuine feeling of tension. The final thirty minutes are basically one big action scene and once it's all over, there's a genuine sigh of relief.<br/><br/>However, as a direct sequel to Alien, things become more ambiguous. On the one hand, I appreciate they tried to do something different. They could've easily remade Alien with a different set of characters being picked off one by one, but that movie already exists: it's called Alien. Instead, Cameron went his own way and turned it into a straight-up action flick. So, I appreciate that at least they didn't get all formulaic on me. On the other hand, the concept of the alien—or Xenomorph—lends itself far more to pure horror. Remember one of those deleted scenes from Alien? It was a short scene where the alien crawled towards someone or something to that effect. But the reason it didn't make the cut is obvious: the alien was completely visible and instead of being horrified, you were looking at it, thinking 'that's a guy in a suit'. So Scott and co applied the Jaws principle: rarely, if ever, show the monster in all its gory glory. It's all about fear of the unknown. What you can't grasp, visually or intellectually, is the definition of horror. That's what the alien is all about. In Aliens however, one can only watch aliens being blown into a pile of yellow goo for so long before they go from 'horrifying, perfect hunting organism' to 'cannon fodder'. So, what the film gains in action, it loses in horror. There's a reason the 2010 video game adaptation Aliens: Colonial Marines—formatted after Cameron's film—failed. It's because you associate the Alien franchise with horror. Fending off endless waves of aliens with guns à la Call of Duty isn't what the Alien franchise is about at its core. No, it's is about a sense of dread; it's about being the hunted and not the hunterwhich is why 2014's game adaptation Alien: Isolation was such a good game.<br/><br/>So, how do you judge Aliens in the end? Is it fair to judge it for being a failed horror film, for the ways it doesn't adhere to the groundwork laid in Alien? Or do you judge it as a film that tried to be something else from the get-go? The latter would be the correct answer I feel. Aliens took the concept in new and exciting directions and did so with aplomb. Though I firmly believe Alien is by far the superior film, I still enjoy Aliens for what it is and for all the things it does right."
"rhiron","8","1","1","6 November 2013"," For once, a sequel worthy of the original!
","Usually, I don't enjoy sci-fi, but this and 'Alien' (1979) are the exceptions.<br/><br/>I watched 'Aliens' in a state of apprehension. Seven years between the original and a sequel (especially a sequel starring one of the original cast members) can be a very long time. A long time for things to go wrong. And this was, perhaps, what was going through the minds of executives at Twentieth Century Fox when they green-lighted James Cameron's sequel to Ridley Scott's masterful horror film set in space.<br/><br/>If anything, if you're going in to 'Aliens' blind or having already watched 'Alien', you're in for an interesting sequence of events.<br/><br/>From the beginning, it's very clear that, as an audience member, you're getting a rare treat, not just in terms of horror or action -- literally in terms of any genre of cinema. You are getting a proper sequel!<br/><br/>But, a sequel that establishes its own rules.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver was feisty and held her own in 'Alien', but here she becomes a pure bad-ass! If you have the 'Alien Quadrilogy' set, you can see from the Director's Cut that her character, Ellen Ripley has a lot of issues going on. The perfect early example of a conflicted, brave and determined heroine. The theatrical release gets these things across well, too. As does the fact that Weaver was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance -- in a time when horror/action flicks were largely denied such honours. Forget Lara Croft - here's the real deal!<br/><br/>But it's in Ripley's interaction with Carrie Henn's character, Newt and Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks that the film develops its pathos. A chance for redemption and a life beyond being terrorised by a load of slimy space monsters.<br/><br/>Not to give too much away, but 'Aliens' is, in an odd way, drawn from similar threads as 'Jurassic Park' (1993) and 'The Lost World' (1997). It's distinct from those films, obviously, but the gung-ho element of an overpowered military force confronting a swarm of devilishly sly and powerful creatures rings similar bells. For die-hard fans of the 'Alien' franchise (or even of films in general), they will know what I am saying when I mention that 'Aliens' also shares key links with Tim Burton's original 'Batman' (1989), from its design to its filming.<br/><br/>There's a really great and touching story here, though, which develops James Cameron as the worthy successor (perhaps even an equal) to Ridley Scott himself in terms of developing the original ideas of Scott and his crew. Incidentally, this is the only one of James Cameron's films that I have seen and enjoyed.<br/><br/>Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein and Bill Paxton in some of their best known and pervasive film roles are all superb and a perfect match for the extremely well cast original film. Goldstein, in particular, has the ballsy attitude of Grace Jones, whilst still remaining a likable character, and Paxton steals some of the film's best dialogue. Even Jones the cat returns!<br/><br/>For once, a sequel that is just as (if not more) enjoyable and hard- hitting as the original. If I had to raise a qualm with the film, it is that the 'Alien' series went into serious decline after this instalment. And, even though I've seen the other sequels, I prefer to accept things as they happened here as rote!!"
"Theflyace","9","1","1","20 September 2013"," A Gut-Wrenching, Adrenaline-Driving Thrill Ride!!!!!!
","When Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" came out in 1979, people were thrilled and scared out of their minds by it. One of those people was Writer/Director James Cameron. He was so enamored with the world of ""Alien"" he decided to write a sequel to it. Then, after his first major film, ""The Terminator,"" came out Fox immediately took his script and picked him as the director. What we have here is not only one of his best movies, but one of the greatest sequels of all time.<br/><br/>The story begins 57 years after the first film, where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is finally rescued in her pod. The planet where the alien colony was first discovered by her and her crew, is now mining planet LV-426, which has lost contact with Earth. She is brought on as a ""consultant"" to a battalion of Marines along with a higher-up in the company to go investigate and establish contact once again. Once they get there though, our friends with the taste for human brains (multiplied by the hundreds this time around instead of one) destroy half of the group, forcing the survivors to barricade themselves to fend off the vicious monsters.<br/><br/>One of James Cameron's claims to fame is his ability to make his characters believable. This proof comes in the form of Ripley. Sigourney Weaver plays her brilliantly, as a driven, determined, and slightly pushy bad-ass, but with a tender side to it. Its a challenge for her to fit in with others in this movie. Everything she once knew is gone, and she is still having night terrors and is physically scarred by her experiences with the alien on the Nostromo. Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress, which was/still is unheard of considering what genre this movie is in.<br/><br/>Ripley also bonds with the only survivor of the colonists, a little girl nicknamed ""Newt."" Again, the bond that blossoms between the two is very believable. And the supporting cast is top notch. Each marine has a memorable personality, and eventually warm up to Ripley and begin to understand the gravity of their situation in this hell-hole. Even Bishop the Android (Lance Henriksen) is given a great personality, and on that Ripley has to learn to trust after her experiences with the evil Ash in the first film.<br/><br/>What makes this film far different from ""Alien"" is instead of it being a straight up horror/suspense film, the action in this movie is turned up infinitely more, and for good use. Cameron is the master of action and he uses his skills here to a great degree. The action itself plays against a larger environment, expertly designed by Peter Lamont, with he help of artists Ron Cobb and Syd Mead, two of the greatest graphic designers ever. Then there is the Alien Queen. WOW!! Created by the late great Stan Winston, the Alien Queen is one of the most menacing creatures in movie history. She is so believable in terms of movement, she leaps off the screen at us in the audience. James Horner's music compliments everything. It is sparse, but when it comes on it's like a hammer that gets our attention and helps the story progress. ""Bishop's Countdown"" is now one of the most famous tracks and trailer cues ever written, and for good reason.<br/><br/>The horror aspects, when they happen in the film, are absolutely superb. They are so graphic and well-timed that you feel like either screaming, or getting sick. But this is necessary blood and gore, as well as making you truly care about the characters and how it successfully creates a sense of unease over who will die and who will survive.<br/><br/>This film is a classic film in the two big ones people go to see, horror and action. The directing is great, the acting is great, the action is beyond awesome. Check it out if you want to be truly given a big dose of adrenaline."
"albnadia","Null","1","1","14 September 2013"," Nearly as good as Alien
","In some ways this is a better movie than Alien. There are characters besides Ripley you become invested in in Aliens. But, you can't beat the suspense of Alien. Alien did a great job with the unexpected betrayal of the crew android, and Aliens did a great job using the new crew android as an ally. I don't know why, but in my mind I group the little girl, Newt, from Aliens in with the Ewoks from Return of the Jedi. I found Newt unnecessary -- yes, it did bring a new dimension to Ripley, but I don't think that we needed that new dimension. Kyle Reese from Terminator has a supporting role as a near-love interest. He didn't make it all the way through the movie, but he was very good here. The fight with the Queen was drawn out, but it understandably couldn't end very quickly. Whether or not you liked Alien, I recommend Aliens. But, I definitely don't recommend the following movies. I may watch the Alien cubed because Tywin Lannister is in it, but watch at your own risk -- I've never heard good things."
"AaronCapenBanner","9","1","1","27 August 2013"," How To Do A Sequel Right!
","James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures...<br/><br/>A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax.<br/><br/>One of the finest sequels ever made!"
"jimbo-53-186511","9","1","1","18 August 2013"," Excellent blend of sci-fi and action which is better than Alien
","There is no doubt that James Cameron is a master film maker with such classic films as Terminator 1 & 2 and True Lies under his belt (which are all personal favourites of mine). He also created Aliens which is a near perfect follow up to the popular 1979 film Alien.<br/><br/>The film begins with a salvage crew discovering a ship which Ripley (Weaver) has been drifting in for 57 years as a result of being in some sort of hyper sleep. She still has her beloved cat Jonesey from the first film who presumably must have been in a hyper sleep as well.<br/><br/>We quickly learn that in the 57 years that Ripley has been asleep (I think only Sleeping Beauty has slept for longer than that)that there have been colonies of families that have been studying the planet where Ripley's crew discovered the Alien life forms in the first film. When contact becomes lost with the colony, a group of marines are sent in to investigate what's been going on - this is initially done as a precaution as they suspect that contact has been lost due to a faulty transmitter. Upon hearing this, Ripley isn't convinced that a faulty transmitter is to blame and she suspects that there is a possibility that the Aliens may have re-surfaced. This leads to Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lt Gorman (William Hope) asking Ripley to join them as a 'consultant' as she is more knowledgeable about the Aliens and they believe that if they are out there, that she will be the best person to assist the Marines in eradicating the Aliens for good.<br/><br/>I think there are 2 main reasons why this works better than Alien. Firstly, the pacing; Aliens gets going a lot more quickly than Alien and never dragged or became dull - this was part of the problem with Alien - the action scenes were good in Alien, but the first 45 minutes were a complete bore. Second was the action scenes - James Cameron is just so much better at creating action sequences which ultimately made Aliens a much more exciting film. One thing that was great about Alien was the direction and the way the tension was created, but James Cameron even with the faster pacing and better action sequences still managed to create arguably greater tension and even crisper direction (but what did you expect from the mastermind behind the excellent original Terminator and the masterpiece of Terminator 2 that followed).<br/><br/>The only minor gripe that I had was the character of Hudson (portrayed by Bill Paxton). Whilst Paxton's acting was great, his character was really annoying with his constant whining and repeatedly saying 'Man' at the end of every sentence. Other than that, I will happily sing this film's praises! Whilst Aliens is undoubtedly a better film than Alien, I would recommend watching Alien before Aliens as you will have a better understanding of the themes contained in Aliens."
"PedroDoud","9","1","1","6 April 2013"," Not 'alien'. But great on its own
","A movie that didn't spoiled the legacy of 'Alien' as so many sequels did with their originals. Cameron's movie is good on its own, without having to hold on the first movie. With more actions scene the flick goes to a different direction, on a 'Bad-A' Ripley and thousands of aliens. We see the evil intents of 'The company' even more clearly on this. All this together sequel worth watching for the quality, not 'just to see' as in the third movie.<br/><br/>Even the new characters (who are mostly bad news to sequels) have their parts well explained, like Bishop, having to gain Ripley's trust, or Burke, who it's only interested in money. <br/><br/>It's a must watch for sure :)"

","The planet from Alien (1979) has been colonised, but contact is lost and a rescue team is dispatched. This 1986 sequel is action packed, bigger, louder, very gung-ho with Vietnam parallels.<br/><br/>I'm torn I must say that at the time Aliens was the best action sci-fi films ever and probably still is, but overtime, I have grown less fond of Aliens and prefer the first Alien and re-edit of the 3rd.<br/><br/>What is superior about Aliens is that it builds on what Ridley Scott created in first film, (even though some of Aliens ideas are based on cut scenes) surprise killings, misdirection and so on. The design and movement of the Alien is greatly improved, making the Alien far more menacing and agile than before. Space is stark, dark and cold and James Cameron captures the isolation and ominous atmosphere perfectly, with an effective use of lighting, shadow and set design.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that Cameron is an exceptional director and writer. All the characters are built up slowly, Lance Henriksen as the synthetic Bishop and Paul Reiser as Burke give subtle performances. Michael Biehn as Hicks and Sigourney Weaver are terrific. Ripley as a character is fleshed out further and the effects and sound are amazing (winning Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects). <br/><br/>Aliens is an unsurpassed solid sci-fi horror sequel packed with action and suspense but in retrospect it really is Alien pumped with more Ripley, testosterone and guns."

"boondocksaint20","Null","1","1","6 October 2002"," One of the best sci-fi horror films ever!
","As a teenager, this was easily my favorite movie, I think I've seen this film around 30 times during those years.  I'll never forget the first time I saw Aliens, I was a kid and it was on really late on HBO.  I was instantly hooked with the characters, story and the thrills...when a movie would give me nightmares for several nights in a row, I knew, even back then that the filmakers did something right.<br/><br/>This was when James Cameron used to make great movies (I'm sorry, but Titanic, though decent, isn't what I'd call a great movie), and you can tell his passion for his writing and directing.  Few movies have used such genious in character development...we get to know the rag-tag group of marines prior to their landing on the alien planet in the best type of way, through sarcastic remarks and immortal one-liners (trust me, this film has a ton of them).  Also, few movies make you feel such a pang of loss when one of them falls prey to the marauding alien menace.  Basically, almost every character reaches an epiphany and changes at the end...it is a story about bravery and courage, primarily, and sci-fi/horror secondarily.  I have to tip my hat off to Cameron, he made a roller coaster of a movie with heart and substance, a rarity these days.<br/><br/>The movie picks up right after the first one, and has Ripley sent with a bunch of space marines to LV-427, the planet where her crew from the first film touched down and made contact with the Alien.  This movie is much better than the first one b\c it effectively utilizes the best elements from the first one (namely, pop out scares and atmosphere...those are about the only reasons when Alien is at the least, a decent movie) and combines it with wonderful story-telling, good special effects, likeable characters who are realistic and heart pounding on the edge of your seat thrills.<br/><br/>After watching it about a year ago on the special edition (that is a must have for any fan, 17 minutes of deleted scenes restored!) I must admit that I had a slightly different look at it.  The alien special effects, though really good, especially for the time, are pretty embarrassing looking at times (there is the same stock footage of the same alien blowing up in an explosion of acid during the marines' initial raid of the hive used several times in a matter of minutes, and the part when the aliens are jumping from the ceiling looks really unrealistic), but it doesn't detract from the movie.  James Cameron creates over half of the film's suspense from the thought of the aliens lurking off screen, and not their actual on-screen presence, which to me is pure genius.  I can kind of see why, though wish they hadn't, cut the scene with the centry guns from the original movie, since it shows these four automated cannons mowing down scores of aliens, it does, in a way lessen the effect of the fear of unknown as opposed to what can be seen.  Cameron uses marine technology (the shoulder mounted vid-cams linked to the troop transport and of course the motion sensors) as tools for suspense.  It is very effective, especially with Hudson's voice cracking, ""Five meters, man...four..."".<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the film has so many memorable one liners, and I won't go into all of them: ""I say we waste him, no offense."" ""Fire in short controlled bursts."" and of course, ""Let's rock!""  Perfect fuel to burn the fires for any adolescent teenager.<br/><br/>What a stellar cast, too.  Lance Hendrickson, Bill Paxton, Sigourney Weaver all give wonderful and believable performances, but the actor that stands out the most is the very talented and incredibly underappreciated, Michael Biehn.  His portrayal of Corporal Hicks, as a calm and collected, brave, but slightly terrified and underexperienced marine is one of the most believable performances I have ever seen.  I wanted to kill the filmmakers of the third Alien movie for offing his character in the first few minutes of the film, which totally ruins the happy ending in Aliens, and kills off the best character in the four movies combined.  It's amazing that Michael Biehn never became a superstar especially with his work with Cameron on three occasions (Terminator 1, Aliens, The Abyss), but anyway, like I said, his performance truly shines.  Bill Paxton does a pretty good job too, given the material he had as a totally unstable short-time marine, and I loved the transformation of his character at the end.<br/><br/>There are a few flaws which have bothered me for years, which is the only reason I cannot give this movie a 10.  *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* First, how did the alien queen get on board the drop ship without anyone noticing (that landing gear opening was waaayyy to small for her to squeeze through), secondly, the guns are supposed to have 50 rounds each left over from the APC reckage, but they fire hundreds if not thousands of bullets at the aliens, also, for 'caseless' bullets, there sure are a lot of spent casings spewing about, and lastly, 60-70 families seems like an unrealistic number for 157 or so colonists...and the list goes on, but these are nit-picky things, and WILL NOT detract from anyone's fun from the movie, these are just minor complaints from a major fan of the series.  SPECIAL NOTICE: This is the funniest goof-up I have ever seen...if you slo-mo the scene where the upper half of Bishop reaches out and grabs Newt's hand as she is nearly sucked out of the ship by the void outside, you can see the hole in the floor where Lance Hendrickson's body/waist is sticking out since he has to literally stand up to grab her, and you also see the obvious 'intestinal bib' that he wears.  This 'goof-up' is hilarious and is worth a look for a good laugh.  ***END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>All in all, a kick ass action flick that has scares, good sci-fi and an excellent story/characters.  Everyone should check this one out, it will definitely keep you entertained on a friday night.  One of my personal favorites.  9/10."
"Agent10","8","1","1","18 April 2002"," A fun ride
","While I liked Aliens, James Cameron managed to do something that no other director in the history of filmmaking has ever done: he enhanced a movie series and simultaneously ruined it.<br/><br/>While Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection aren't exactly the best films, they would have been a more natural progression in the series. The dialogue, the cinematography and the pacing was more conducive to that of the original film. As for Cameron, while his film is entertaining, he brought nothing to enhance the series artistically. Granted, I love all of Hudson's one-liners as much as the next person, it just didn't fit with the vision of the original film. All in all, this film presents a conundrum for me. I watch the film whenever its on TV or whenever I'm bored, but inside, I can't help thinking about what Cameron did to the series. Maybe I need to see a shrink or something."
"MadReviewer","8","1","1","20 April 2001"," What're We Supposed To Use Now, Harsh Language?
","I felt so soiled after watching the mindless train wreck called `Alien: Resurrection' that I was compelled to watch `Aliens' immediately afterward, in order to cleanse my palette and to remind myself why Hollywood keeps the `Alien' franchise on life support.  Man, if only some new director could recapture the essence of `Aliens', or if only James Cameron could be convinced to direct the next film in the franchise.  `Aliens' is that good.<br/><br/>`Aliens', for the uninitiated, picks up sixty some-odd years after the end of the original `Alien'.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the lone survivor of the doomed spaceship Nostromo, is found by a passing galactic freighter and revived from suspended animation.  Ripley learns that the lethal lessons learned by her ship's crew went unnoticed by the rest of the universe  the planet where her crew found the original deadly Alien creature has been partially terraformed and colonized by human settlers.  But, surprise surprise, the colony's been wiped out, and now a hard-bitten group of Space Marines are going to the planet to find out what happened.  Ripley is conscripted as an advisor and goes back to the planet with the Marines, where they discover that the colony hasn't been wiped out by a single Alien. . . but by an Alien brood mother and her legions of hungry, vicious, offspring.<br/><br/>In making `Aliens', James Cameron created a great sequel to a great original film, one that manages to remain true to the original while offering a fresh take on old ideas.  Cameron took the original look and feel of the Alien creatures, remained faithful with the character of Ripley . . . and then moved forward with a brand new story.  `Aliens' isn't simply a rehash of Ridley Scott's `Alien'.  While they possess certain common denominators, they're two distinctly different films.  `Aliens' is wall-to-wall pulse-pounding action, while `Alien' is more straightforward horror. Cameron deliberately didn't try to copy Ridley Scott, which is why this film works so well . . . and why the later sequels don't.  Those later films have nothing new to say.<br/><br/>The fights between the Marines and the Aliens are gripping as well, masterfully directed and choreographed by Cameron.  The Marines, while mostly personality stereotypes, are fairly memorable as well  it's quite a shock to see their bravado before they encounter the Aliens, and the shreds of what's left afterwards.  A great ensemble cast  Michael Biehn is very good as the vulnerable Sergeant Hicks, as is Lance Henrikson as the android Bishop (in a nice nod to the `Terminator' films, it's implied that androids were originally created by the Cyberdyne Corporation), and Paul Reiser is outstanding as Carter Burke, an oily government executive.  Besides Sigourney Weaver, though, the best performance comes from Carrie Henn as Newt, the little girl who also happens to be the only survivor of the original colony massacre.  Her character's vital to the film  Ripley wants to protect Newt at all costs, much as the Alien Brood mother wants to protect her lethal progeny.  If Newt was unlikable, or if she was just a two-dimensional cardboard cutout, a lot of Ripley's motivations  and the plot  would fall flat on its face.  Fortunately, she's terrific.  And so is `Aliens'.<br/><br/>There are a few plot holes that keep `Aliens' from being a classic, but the film moves along at such a rapid pace, you really don't have much time to notice them.  Still, `Aliens' is one of James Cameron's best films.  It's a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish.  If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend renting it sometime soon.  You won't be disappointed. Grade: A-"

","Easily Cameron's best film. Aliens is an amazing film which was made for a mere $16 million which puts this years crappy CGI fests to shame.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Ripley drifting through space 52 years after the first film. She is told that there is a colony on the planet where the first alien was found and that they had lost contact with. She is sent there with a bunch of marines and then hell breaks loose. The colony is desolate, the only survivor being a small girl, Newt(one of only two child actors who could ever act, the other being Haley Joel Osment).  Oh yes, plus there's the small fact that the Aliens have taken over it. There are some stunning action sequences involving the aliens and some brilliant characterisations. Sigourney Weaver is at a career best as Ripley, the only female hero ever to be taken seriously. There are some very funny moments and the aliens are b****y scary. All in all, a first class film, thoroughly entertaining from start to finish. Oh, and if you can hunt it down, there's a director's cut which adds more character material and an extra action sequence doing the rounds. 10/10"

","It was a total disappointment for me. Why? Parallel plot to Alien 1, but without any surprise, nor horror or anxiety atmosphere.<br/><br/>It's almost the same script: <br/><br/>*-At the beginning everybody ignores Ripley, then she turns to be the heroine. Of course she has more abilities than any trained soldier. *-At the beginning everybody underestimate the real danger, then are wiped out. *-Same characters, the one to hate worried about science/money, the hysteric, the brute/warrior. *-If in the first movie a cat survives, and nobody knows why, in the second is the turn to the cute girl. Once you see her, you know she is gonna make it. *-The end the same: same last destruction of the complex, same alien in the last ship believing they are safe, same way to kill it.<br/><br/>So you end with the same storyline but without the surprise elements: <br/><br/>*-You know already the Alien. In the first it's totally uncertain. The only way to give more excitement is simple: more aliens. *-The characters are so recognizable, who is important who is not, that almost you can predict the order of their death. *-Another Robot. In the first movie he was the bad + Ripley hates immediately Bishop = the robot is good in this movie. *-So who is the bad? Again the one that is friendly, so predictable. *-The anguish in the first is achieved because they are in the space, unnatural environment for humans, and without no way to scape. In the second they are on ground settled in a base. *-There is no way Ripley, a child, and a paralytic robot, could avoid being vacuum by the space. *-James Cameron hasn't any original idea in this movie.<br/><br/>Conclusion: the title is perfectly chosen, Aliens is Alien but with more Aliens. It would be a good movie if the first didn't exist. Because it does, Aliens is not a good movie."

Alien 2 is ""just"" an action movie with big explosions, and very cliché and dull characters."
"Kontroversial","5","5","12","29 September 2016"," Good, but not nearly as great as Alien or Alien 3
","Aliens has been officially called one of the very few sequels to be deemed better than the original by critics. Sue me, but I liked the original Alien movie and Alien 3 a lot better.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really liked Aliens, it's a good movie... but it somehow lacked the tense atmosphere and isolation of ALIEN and ALIEN 3. Aliens is The Terminator of the Alien franchise- directed by no one else but Terminator's own James Cameron - and it is definitely more action-oriented. That is not necessarily bad, and I can understand why some people might prefer this, I however didn't.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) reprises her role with equal brilliance as in Alien, and there is no doubt, without her there wouldn't have been a Terminator 2's Sarah Connor and probably no Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Xena Warrior Princess. Ripley is a genuine action hero and a role model for female heroines.<br/><br/>Apart from the stereotypical marines, performances are quite good, first and foremost Lance Henrickson and also Michael Biehn.<br/><br/>The 1990 special edition (director's cut) offers more depth to the characters, but at a run time of almost 3 hours is a bit long, the theatrical version is paced just perfectly. <br/><br/>The aliens are more numerous and serve as cannon fodder rather than posing a serious threat at times. Some of the prolonged action scenes in the DC are tedious and I can understand why they didn't make it into the theatrical cut. I prefer the isolation and near powerlessness of Alien and Alien 3 to the more action- and SFX- oriented Aliens.<br/><br/>Aliens' outstanding visual and sound effects won Academy Awards. Unlike many other movies, these Oscars are well deserved. The aliens look outstanding and far better than some of today's CGI BS. Like Terminator 2, Aliens was a landmark for SFX."

","WARNING! MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I guess I'm not a big James Cameron fan...<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie, I thought it was awesome! I was 14.<br/><br/>I have a new view of movies now, and when I see this one, I can see right through all of Cameron's ""over the top"" antics. He has this urgent desire to sacrifice believability in his films. (airplane scene in True Lies, big rig sliding scene in Terminator 2, etc...) When he did The Terminator, he should have called it good and let things be. After The Terminator, however, he went back to his Piranha II style and thus we get Aliens. Another sequel. While it has good special effects (the model making was first rate), the characters are weak and we have a hard time embracing them. When Bill Paxton's character Hudson gets it, it is a much needed relief. If he had said ""game over"" one more time, I'm sure I would have had tears well up in my eyes. Vasquez, on the other hand, acts as if she could take on the entire Alien race all by herself. Maybe she should have tried that, so we wouldn't have to put up with her macho style in this movie. Unfortunately, those two are the characters I remembered most,(aside from Ripley) and I hated them.<br/><br/>The movie seems to be written pretty well (except for the weak characters that are even weaker due to Cameron's directing) and the overall idea is strong, but looking at it now, it seems a little too... Is ""campy"" what I'm looking for? ... and it didn't age all that well. The original Alien is a timeless masterpiece that has held up strongly over the years and leaves you wanting more. Aliens is what it is...  ...An attempt to make an over the top, effects filled, summer blockbuster that would have been better without the ""throw away"" characters, and the strong James Cameron influence.<br/><br/>At least it's not Aliens 3!"

"sagixmtt","6","4","9","18 February 2018"," First time watching this. Cool, but too cheesy
","I have just finished watching Alien and Aliens(editor's cut) for the first time, and while I loved the first Alien (9/10) I find the second far too cheesy, for what could be a great movie.<br/><br/>Cheesy - The cheese starts when Ripley is ""killed"" by an alien coming out her chest - oh wait, that was just a dream. Cheesy, tho it did serve a purpose of her having ""nightmares"". Fair, let's give it a pass!<br/><br/>Predictable and badly paced - It continues with a slow pace where the movie ""pretends"" that Ripley is not going to go back to the xenomorph world when we all know she is going to. Let's just wait while the pictures move on screen. I guess I get what they were aiming for, the movie wanted to highlight her conflict again. Fair, yet boring. let's give it a pass.<br/><br/>Cardboard cut characters except Ripley - She meets the crew, they all act far too rebellious and ""bad-ass"" (as they put it) for my taste and what I think army should represent. Later on in the movie they will also act completely unprofessionally and the new lieutenant will obviously take the route of the Hollywood cardboard character and break under pressure. Cheesy, silly. The commercial ship from the first movie acted more professionally than those guys. The ""panic"" was there just to serve the movie's chaotic atmosphere and forcefully draw tension.<br/><br/>Bad intrigue - The company guy that went with them was a far too obvious ""intrigue"" plotliine, his story got nowhere interesting and did not even serve any tension (he just got eaten by the end) except being a reminder that ""the company is bad"". Alright - We got that from the first film already. The intrigue with ""mother"" was done so much better than this one.
Atmosphere - The atmosphere... Now that is my biggest problem. It felt like an action thriller more than anything. In the first movie It felt intimate. I felt as if Im with them stuck on that ship, it was tense, it was personal. In this second one, I felt like im just watching explosions layed out in a generic sci-fi hollywood fashion. Characters died in the order you'd expect according to how much the audience liked them, probably someone out there in the studio made a chart and thats the order characters were killed. No surprises anywhere throughout the entire movie. <br/><br/>The action was still very awesome and yeah in the end of the day I like explosions as much as the other guy. The actors mainly did a good job. I did feel stressed for Ripley despite knowing that she could in no way be harmed, same for the little girl Newt. I mainly felt stressed for their struggles and hardships, rather than for their lives. 
Ripley is a very well done character. Writing good main is not easy and I do admire this character's arc. She is just flawed and human enough to be a great hero that we can not only admire but also relate to.
I did have fun watching this movie, pointing out all the wrong things i believe it does does not change it. All in all, how I feel is that this movie was just mediocre, I know this movie is very much loved, so you are welcome to disagree. Just had to spill out what i think."
"yourfavoritecritic","5","4","9","1 August 2017"," Does Not Live Up to Scott's Alien
","Seven years after the release of Ridley Scott's Alien, James Cameron took the helm of the sequel, Aliens, starring Sigourney Weaver and Bill Paxton. Aliens, picks up five decades in the future, with the discovery of Ripley still in her cryo-chamber. After her recovery, Ripley is tasked with a rescue mission, to find out what happened to a group of colonists after their signal has been lost. Alongside Ripley, is a military group that brings heavy machinery and firepower, but is it enough to put an end to what is going on, on the colonist's moon?<br/><br/>Hailed as one of the best in the series, and an iconic action film, I went to Aliens with pretty high expectations, and left feeling completely underwhelmed. The film itself felt very generic, and slow, I was never completely interested in what was happening on screen, so much of the film sets up to these huge action moments, and though the sequences were well choreographed and cool, everything else about this film felt very bland. Many of the characters in this film were just complete morons and never found myself rooting for them. Outside of Ripley, I did not like one character. I'm not sure whether that was Cameron's intention, but with so much of the film based around these military personals, and their development, I couldn't wait to see some of them die. Now if the army boneheads weren't aggravating enough, the filmmakers thought it'd be a brilliant idea to bring a child into the mix, and oh, man. What a mistake that was. I can understand the writer's choice to add Newt as a character to the story, as it adds more dilemma to the plot, however most of the time, it just seemed like a plot convenience to further extended the runtime of the climax and the actresses chosen to bring Newt to life was just awful. Many of her awkward line deliveries and forced screams, so rather than care about this character, I just found myself getting annoyed. <br/><br/>Now this film isn't all bad, like I was saying the action in this film is fantastic, and the practical effects used, really held up and still looked good to this day. It's just a shame that this movie suffers so much from being uninspired, I never felt moments of intensity and half the time I was just bored. Maybe it's because I've seen films like this done better nowadays, and it's just a movie stuck in its time, or my feelings of disdain towards this movie, is drawn to the concept mainly being used in a science-fiction horror movie and not sci-fi action. <br/><br/>I've seen this movie a couple times now, and both times, I've felt bored and disappointed, I can see the love some individuals have for this film, but it is just not for me. It is a competent film, however it suffers from weak characters and a lack of originality. If you were a fan of Alien, I would recommend checking this film out, just know it is not for everyone and definitely not perfect, Aliens gets a 5/10."
"pontram","6","4","9","18 April 2009"," Almost an Army feature Film
","When I saw ""Aliens"" more than 20 years ago, I didn't like it because of the military presence. I didn't like the Army, and I didn't believe that in the future such an armed rabble would be used to make something like 'first contact' with possibly precious xenomorphs. I disliked the complete crew, and my understanding was that the movie was sympathizing with them. Maybe I was wrong and it is all humor, and the Army is satirized. I'm not that intelligent, you should know.<br/><br/>At first, I liked the introduction. Ripley aged only a few years during her 57 years hibernation, I found that time line a good Idea. Unfortunately, script writer's imagination could not transport the effects of this half century, on the contrary, technology, clothing and behavior mention more a regression than improvement.<br/><br/>First laugh (in a bad sense) was, when Ripley was accused for destroying her worthy freighter Nostromo. Of course was the Nostromo worthy like a supertanker, but isn't a ship of this size and the cargo insured ? They had 57 years to get the insurance sum, so what's up with this future ?<br/><br/>Later it comes out that the contact to the colony on the Alien egg planet is lost. Surely they had no opportunity to report what happened. A colony around an expensive atmospheric modifier doesn't give any reports about what's happening or any dangerous incidents.<br/><br/>Someone in the movie says that it lasts decades to transform a planets atmosphere. Meanwhile the colonists, which are obviously researching the surface, didn't find any trace from the huge stranded spaceship, which sent the distress call that led the Nostromo to her final destruction in the first movie. OK, colonists are dumb or simply blind.<br/><br/>Also dumb are the marines. Confrontated with Ripley who is the last survivor of a deadly alien encounter, they are not willing to hear anything what she says. I as their officer would have made them shut up immediately, because every information could be important for surviving. If soldiers of the future are such idiots as shown here, there would be no need for powerful aliens to destroy humanity.<br/><br/>I can't imagine that any officer wouldn't send artificial drones ahead to research the situation. I can't imagine, too, that anyone would send such a small and dumb team to investigate the possible alien-caused death of 70 families. The mission in the later ""AVP"" movie is much better prepared with scientists from all over the world. OK, here we have Bishop, but he doesn't seem to be very helpful, and he has no rights to make decisions. A few more Bishop's, especially for fighting purposes, would have made the mission more serious.<br/><br/>The greatest disappointment in ""Aliens"" is the disappearance of the alien's being nearly indelible. When the alien in the first movie is not even destroyed by the escape pod's jet engines (it's adapting to the heat, i suppose), it is here like destroying cockroaches. You can squish them with your car, you can shoot them, or simple burn with a standard flamethrower. A bunch of well-armed soldiers with a little bit more brain than the people shown in this movie would be able to eliminate a complete alien population. For what purpose would the military use such a weak race defies me. Sure, you can infest a planet of your enemies, you don't have to care about them any more. But then your own world would be also in danger because of the revenge of the survivors. And the infested world is useless. However, I know, military is always interested in new and dangerous toys.<br/><br/>The mystery of the aliens and the other race - the big stoned guy - from the first movie is completely gone. It is simply a bug slashing feature film. When they find out that the colonists have already caught two living facehuggers, Burke's mission would be done. Instead, they are going ahead for certain death. <br/><br/>There are many errors in the script. One is, how did Burke mange to put the facehugger to Ripley's sleeping place. Did he carry the containment tank, or did he carry the alien under his arm ? Then, there is the first confrontation between the Queen and Ripley. Ripley fills the eggs with loads of ammo and explosives, Mother's bearing channel is slashed, and there is no acid burning Ripley and Newt. And in the final fight, the ladder where Ripley is hanging is always within reach for the queen's second hand. Instead, she is angrily swinging around with her free arm. And I thought (almost), come on, big lady, take the ladder, take it, please, and then eat Ripley for killing your babies. Poor mother, so big, so dumb.<br/><br/>The positive side is, that - blinding out the mediocre script, visuals, dialogs and actors - the movie is actually thrilling. It's more thrilling than most of the movie's of it's time, and the idea to fight the queen with the cargo loading exoskeleton is really funny. I personally understood Ripleys decision to go for Newt into the burning reactor, but I also understood that the figure of Newt is only a vehicle to fill plot holes.<br/><br/>I gave 5 stars even if it deserves six for the thrill of the hunt."

Looks like someone who didn't like Science Fiction work, he certainly knows which side his bread is buttered now.<br/><br/>For some reason or other, the original role for Hicks had been given to James Remar, who played Ajax in Walter Hill's magnificent gang movie The Warriors (1979). His departure, as well as British born Director of Photography Dick Bush, whose work as Cinematographer on Tommy (1975), Yanks (1979) and Trail of the Pink Panther (1982) for examples, does leave some doubt and questions. To be replaced for creative differences because you didn't, it would seem, hit it off with the then Aliens Producer, Gale Ann Hurd. Oh, by the way, she, at the time was married, from 1985 to 1989, to the then Aliens Director James Cameron.<br/><br/>We are given the impression that Aliens consists of just a few tightly grouped movie-making buddies scratching each other's back, same old Actors working, again, for the same old Director, there goes the Character Development then.<br/><br/>While the Alien franchise is one of my favourites, I personally do think that Aliens is more overrated. While not the weakest of the whole collection, to me, this is just a bug hunt with to much off the ""yahoo"" and ""yeeha"" mentality. It's forever in in our face, and in the end is more important than the actual beasts that the movie should be concerning itself with. <br/><br/>The first Alien movie, (Directed by Ridley Scott and released in 1979), is a Historical Movie Milestone of tense character development and visual art. This, Aliens, is the unsensational opposite, having gone for the Lock and Load and Egos' are Us direction, he has turned an opportunity of imagination and creativity into thought-less sensation. Looking as though it was quickly thrown together, the Thunderbirds models were looking a little thin by the end of this movie.<br/><br/>It seemed, allegedly, that Ms Weaver threatened to do no more Alien movies after seeing the final cut.<br/><br/>The Bold as Brass and over the top Rent-a-Heroes are the epitome of the over zealous Movie Marines that is seen in just about every movie ever made. This movie has the miss fortune of having to use this type of Movie Marine stereo typecasting, nothing new to report here, luuuteennannt Ssiiirr.<br/><br/>Boring! Predictable! Obvious! <br/><br/>This Egg came severely cracked and grew not into an Alien epic, but more Pigs in Space, it's a Muppet Show sketch from the 1970's.<br/><br/>What more can I say? <br/><br/>Except, <br/><br/>""Come on Aliens, put me out of my misery, and finish your dinner, because it's getting cold"".<br/><br/>Signing Off!"

"itamarscomix","5","4","10","23 September 2011"," Very overrated
","Aliens is, by all accounts, a very solid and effective sci-fi epic. James Cameron shifted the horror/sci-fi blend of the 1979 original towards a more action/adventure oriented film, and as such, it works: The action scenes are good all around. But as a follow-up to one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, it fell short for me, and the constant referring to it as the best film in the series is, in my opinion, heavily unjustified. Even if taken at face-value as an action movie, it doesn't have a lot of substance on top of the action, and unlike Cameron's Terminator films it's often lacking in structure, pacing and especially in self-awareness of any kind - Aliens is dead and dull serious all the time.<br/><br/>And when compared to the first movie, a champion of tension and atmosphere, Aliens is almost constantly predictable, and failed to get me into any state of real suspense. Also, while Alien was filled to the brim by a cast of first rate character actors - John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm, Tom Skerritt - which made every death a shocking moment, the cast of Aliens, except for Sigourney Weaver's admittedly excellent performance (though I preferred her scared survivor in Alien over her kick-ass action girl in Aliens), is pretty dull. Lance Henriksen is good in his few brief scenes as Bishop, but Michael Biehn is as unimpressive as ever, Carrie Henn doesn't get any real sympathy, and as for Paul Reiser - his cookie-cutter evil-corporate-shell character is as dull as his perfect clone, Giovanni Ribisi's character in Avatar.<br/><br/>I may have overstated the movie's faults - it's not, by any means, a bad one, but for those reasons (mainly) I can't consider it one of my favorites, while Ridley Scott's original is. Interesting to note that many of those reasons are the same that make me dislike all other James Cameron movies, all of which are, with the exception of T2, unbelievably and ridiculously overrated."
"Semih","5","6","18","6 June 2000"," Yeah, typical shoot'em up Hollywood movie.

If it weren't for Sigourney Weaver, Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, this movie would be a disgrace to the Alien movies. This is the worst among all four Alien movies. But just because it is watchable and fun, I gave it a  5 out of 10."

"DonaldDooD","6","2","4","30 August 2014"," Good, But Needs To Be Taken Down A Few Pegs
","Alien was a suspenseful, sci-fi horror film. Aliens decided to add more aliens and abandon most of the suspense and horror in exchange for action. That'd be fine, if it weren't so meat-headed.<br/><br/>The first major problem is the film uses a large number of people as cannon fodder, nothing else. Nothing is more infuriating than when an action film has absolutely no respect for human life. These mercenaries are annoying jock stereotypes whose death has zero effect on me. Seriously, these wastes of space have no wonder or fear over monstrous aliens? Nuts to that. Those scenes sucked.<br/><br/>The other issue is how the action is shot. Normally, cinematography is not something I pay attention to. Its like controls in video games - its just assumed you can shoot stuff right. Maybe some rare talent can create something impressive. But its impossible to ignore how jumpy the camera gets when the action picks up. Gunfire, CUT, alien screams, CUT, guy fires again, CUT, guy gets bitten, CUT, show his face, CUT, back to his arm. Jesus Christ, calm down! You don't need to hide these special effects! <br/><br/>Once the mercenaries are decimated, and the camera decides to act normal, it gets better. Once again, the setting and effects are great. You truly believe we are on some different planet. And the aliens are as intimidating as ever, although some of their majesty is lost since they're killed so often. And the ending is pretty awesome. The characterization has improved, too. It could have been better, but I had a greater idea on who Ripley was. I'm iffy on Newt - she doesn't add much to the story, but she does provide a contrast between Ripley and Newt and the xenomorphs.<br/><br/>Aliens is far from a perfect action film. Even ignoring higher standards for art, some scenes destroy their own suspense. Sure, its pretty good. IMDb Top 250? I don't think so."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","4","6 November 2008"," Revving up the action without sacrificing the story
","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" was an eerie science-fiction masterpiece that perfectly captured a haunting feeling of space and redefined ""intelligent life."" Then comes time for a sequel and James Cameron, 80s action extraordinare, takes the reigns. Conflicting visions? You'd think, but somehow Cameron is able to increase the explosions without frying what made its predecessor so successful.<br/><br/>Part of that success is the strength of Sigourney Weaver as the courageous Ellen Ripley, the best sci-fi heroine in cinematic history. This time, Ripley is awoken from hypersleep over 50 years after her first encounter with the Alien to find that the planet it was discovered on has been colonized by humans and those humans have suddenly lost contact. Ripley is asked to aide a team of space marines to check on the colonists and what they find are, well, Aliens. Lots of them.<br/><br/>Cameron makes sure that the sequel continues Ripley's story, portraying her yet again as being doubted by others and having to correct the life-threatening mistakes they make. She continues to captivate viewers because she reacts naturally to scary situations but then chooses to act courageously.<br/><br/>Then, Cameron adds plenty extra guns, flame-throwers, grenades, Alien goo and more. It's almost overkill how much stuff explodes in this film and yet it never loses credibility with its audience because of the believability of the characters' struggle for survival.<br/><br/>The plot, while a very honest follow-up to ""Alien,"" is structured in a very deja-vu manner to that film, most obviously the idea of making you think it's over when it's not over. There are also similarities in character betrayal as Ripley is apparently the only one that thinks straight up killing the Aliens is a good idea. <br/><br/>""Aliens"" is much more exciting and fast-paced than the original, though the original still one-ups it with its strong, resonant themes about space and life. This film continues those themes but doesn't add to them like a brilliant sequel does. It instead chooses to honor the strength of the original while pumping up the special effects, which are truly grandiose and stunning."
"OllieSuave-007","10","2","4","15 June 2007"," 'Aliens' is one thrilling scene after the other.
","Sigourney Weaveer returns as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of the alien attack on the mining ship Nostromo. She journeys back to the planet LV-426 where her crew had encountered an alien species for the first time. This time she must deal with dozens of the alien species, who have since colonized. The result is a thrilling, high-powered, action-packed and suspense battle to the finish.<br/><br/>James Cameron did an excellent job directing, creating an intense atmosphere full of suspense and action, and directed a cast who gave solid and in-depth performances. Each character gave a memorable and unique style of acting including those of: Weaver's on screen drama mixed in with sarcasm and wit; Bill Paxton's wise-cracking and hyper personality; Michael Biehn's calm and never-say-die attitude; Jenette Goldstein's macho image; and Carrie Henn's enduring and spirited character. <br/><br/>The special effects were realistic and spectacular. James Cameron, David Giler and Walter Hill did an awesome job on the story, making the plot of the movie interesting and intriguing, leaving no room for plot holes and keeping the entire film's momentum going.

But this time, there are many to go around, and once it starts, it just doesn't stop (including a startling ending).

","First of all, the plot of science fiction action movies is not static, and the intuitive feelings for action movies are only really narrow. The strength of this film has surpassed most of the science fiction films of today. The plot is not static. On the contrary, it is somewhat like a disaster film. It can die at any time. The movie viewing experience is also excellent. It makes people admire the ability of James Cameron. It 's not a joke to set a large set of books. The fantasy of various firearm computers is also very cool. Except for the armored vehicle, it is very unscientific, the chassis is so low and it is not practical. As a chariot company of alien colonists The mountain can't adapt, how can it be applied to the army. This movie made me truly awesome about American science fiction movies. Before watching ""Interstellar"", I found that the theme is very good, but in fact, after returning home, I found that my child is aging (old death). The plot is in this movie. That's it, feelings under fantasy are really powerful. In this movie, it seems that I have also seen the inspiration for many works. The ""Alien"" series is really a milestone in science fiction.<br/><br/>In fact, the difference between the first part and the first part is quite big. The first part focuses on horror and horror. This one is an action shootout. Many places nowadays look at it and want to call it addictive. The first part is a team that has no hope in space, and finally did not return to the earth, giving a sense of depression. This part is from the military 's disdain to extreme fear to being annihilated to reflect the strength of the alien.<br/><br/>The ending is too hasty, and it really ends after ""beating the bad guys""."

","Text: Alien is a story about of course Aliens and its a fantastic movie. The story centers around Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley a woman who was in hypersleep for 57 years. While I didn't know what happened she was seemingly on a mission once with crewmates who all end up dying due Aliens. Of course none of her bosses belive her and she ends up being demoted, they also belive she could have killed them. Ripley left her daughter behind to complete this mission, and like I said she was in hyper space, for 57 years so she was dead by the time she came back. Missing the 11th year old birthday party she said she will be there for.<br/><br/>Now the real story happens when a distress signal encountered by Carter Burke from a terraforming colony, basically asking for help. Burke contacts Ripley to try to get her to go face the aliens just one last time, she accepts on one conditions. They would go there to save life and defeat the aliens, not use them as test subjects. Now here is where the meat of the story is...everything goes wrong. A group of Marines lets say 20 of them all go to this distant planet so see whatsups. Off course there cocky and none them believe aliens exactly aisst, they don't even respect RiIpley but suprise suprise, when they encounter the aliens most of them die.<br/><br/>The only ones to surive are Corpoal Dwayne Hicks and private Hudson and Vasquez. Lets talk about these characters for a sec, Hudson was a bit of a nervous wreck. We first get too see how he like when they play the knife came and Hudson is scared out of his mind. We next see see him freak out and almost kill a little girl named Newt. Then throughout the show he is constantly freaking out say WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, WERE ALL GONNA DIE. Although in the ends he mans up in the end and faces the Aliens head on, and dies like a chad.<br/><br/>Next we got Vasquez who had a good bond with the rest of the crewmates making jokes and lauging with them. She especially had a good bond with a certain man named Drake who unfortunately got killed by the Aliens. She and Him were like jocks and didn't want to listen to the rules which costed them later. As there weapons they used were too dangerous to use, and despite lieutenant Gormon telling them its too risky. Blah blah She had the chance to save him, blah blah Gormon wouldn't let her because its too risky. Gormon knocked out for like the entire middle part of the move, comes back in the third acts. Gormon goes out of his way to try and save Vasquez blah blah they know they can't win. So they both press and explosive tirgger and killed themselves in order to buy the reamning guys time. Vasquez was mad and wanted to kick Gormon ass, but she dies with him.<br/><br/>Captain Hicks is my favorite character in this movie, his whole crews die but the dude just keeps his head up the entire move. He acts maturely and its no wonder he is a captain, his bond with Ripley was sweet and when he told Ripley his named was Dwayne Ripley and Ripley saying her name is Ellen I wanted them to get together, as typically cowerker call each other by there last name, but friends do not. Thank god he doesn't die.<br/><br/>Lets talk about Bishop he is an android, now Ripley had a bad experience with an andriod once as situatuion happen causing the death of some of her commrades. So she ends up insulting him, and the common trend of this movie happens here. Hudsons is a coward dies like a badass. Vasquez causes the death of her teammates, dies saving her teammates. Gordon nervous wreck who can't say simple directions and could have potentially saved more lifes, confidently goes out to save Vasquez and keeps a level head the entire time. Bishop ends up saving the day when he manages to get a spaceship to fly them out of the planent, although he aint realizes the Queen Aliens ended up on top, really and earns the respect of Ripley, when she belived he could be a potential threat.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about Carter Blurke, he is your typically villain in the story who cares more about money than the people. We find out that he was the one that sent that terraforming colony to the Alien places, and didn't warn about the potential creatures there. Now while I hate him and his death made me smile, he is a great addition to this story due to the tension he causes. There a very line that hits deep where Ripley says I don't know who is worse, humans or aliens because atleast aliens don't to to kill one another. Anyway we find our Blurke is some sick fuck who tried to get his crew and a little girl all to be implanted with Alien eggs inside of him. So that went they go home he could become some scientific millionaire and be set for life. He gets caugh and he doesn't learn his lesson as again now tries to kill his crew so he won't be imprisoned or killed for basically his attempted murder. He ends up getting killed by one of the Aliens when he could have surived.<br/><br/>Now lets talk about Ripley and her relationship with Newt. Riplay lost her family and her daughter. Newt lost her family and her mother. Ripley finds the little girl and eventually givers her hope. Newt was so hopeless that even after the armed marines found her she though she we be better off alone, she had no plans to get off that terrible place. Anyway Ripley and Newt bond throughout the movie cultivating in my favorite scene. Badass Ripley defeated the mother alien by fighting her in a mech and blasting it off into space (yes you heard that right). She starts of miserable with no hope, to becoming hopeful and smiling as when she gets captured by one of the aliens to become a spawn. Ripley ends up coming to save her and she says ""I knew you would come"". Ripley is the most badass female main character I have ever scene in the movie. I mean the way she just goes against and faces off the Mother Alien alone is so fucking cool. The way she escapes is fucking cool too she is way more braver than I am. This move isn't a ten just because the beggining scence wasn't as interesting as when they finally meet the Aliens, but still this is a good movie and a must watch.

Along the way the colonial marines and Ripley have to fight for survival to deal with the threat of the xenomorphs. There are more facts learned about the xenomorphs such as their hive structure but the xenomorph from the first game is present in abundance. The characters in this movie actively fight back against the xenomorphs and can destroy them. The xenomorph being classified as the ultimate being in the first movie is not true seeing how they struggle against the marines when they are aware of the aliens.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly well produced. There production qualities of this movie is of the highest degree. The movie's universe feels like a lived-in future. There is not any ridiculous technologies present in this movie. Aliens continues the same worn-down technology from the first movie. The technology present in the movie is not a sterilized future. Instead each of the items feels like a run-down technology that could exist in the future.<br/><br/>All of the side characters in Aliens have a great roles and dialogue. Each of them feels like a distinct character even when they embody some of the same traits. Each of the colonial marines have their own characteristics. They serve as characters that play a part in the story and characters that the audience can enjoy.<br/><br/>Aliens is incredibly influential and served to influence science fiction movies in the next few decades.

","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" was a classic sci-fi horror film. He used claustrophobic sets and atmosphere to create a creepy, modern monster film. James Cameron's ""Aliens,"" however, is a great sci-fi action film.<br/><br/>Both films benefit from having competent directors at the helm. Both directors take a different approach to the material, which lends each film a unique feel. We never feel like we just watched the same movie twice, nor that we saw an inferior spin-off of the first--common complaints about sequels.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is a self-contained story. (I actually saw ""Aliens"" before I saw ""Alien""... back in the third grade. My parents were cool like that.) The action picks up 57 years after the events in the first film. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been in hibernation since her first ordeal with the alien. Her story of the alien is met with derision, and her bosses demote her for blowing up her ship, the Nostromo. Ripley is horrified to learn colonists have been living on the planet where her crew encountered the alien for 20 years. However, when contact breaks off with the colonists, Ripley is sent in with the Marines as a consultant to confront the aliens. The Marines find the colony devoid of life, except for one little girl, Newt, who has managed to survive by hiding in the vents.<br/><br/>Lesser films use children as a cheap device to force the audience to care about the outcome of the story. Here, the relationship between Ripley and Newt is pivotal to showing Ripley's maternal side, which is essential to the development of the character.<br/><br/>Cameron takes his time setting up the story and building suspense. Almost an hour passes before the first encounter with the aliens. The set-up can be perfunctory at times, with dialogue between the Marines seemingly copy-and-pasted from ""Full Metal Jacket."" From the midway point, however, the action doesn't let up. We sat through the slow ride to the top of the roller coaster, and it is all thrills until the end.<br/><br/>This film is now 27 years old and was so popular that if you're reading this, you probably have already seen it. I will instead write about one of the themes of the Alien franchise that I find interesting in understanding the films. Much has been written about how the franchise is actually about rape. However, I will write about the series's feminist undertones.<br/><br/>My Western Civ teacher at the University of Kansas, John Younger, lectured about how the feminist movement can be traced through the series.<br/><br/>""Alien"" was released in '70s, a time when the feminist movement was in its most militant phase. Ripley, a butch female, single-handedly destroys the alien (which has a penis-shaped head and penis-like extremities protruding from its body). This was after it had already killed all her male companions, proving that ""women need men the way fish need bicycles.""<br/><br/>""Aliens"" came out in '80s, when feminists began to embrace their femininity. We see this in the motherly role Ripley adopts toward Newt. Ripley goes alone with a pulse rifle taped to a grenade launcher to rescue Newt from the alien queen.<br/><br/>""Alien 3"" came out in '90s, when the feminist movement became more inclusive, and progressive men could actually be considered feminists. In the third installment, the men of the penal colony work together with Ripley to destroy the alien.<br/><br/>As for the subsequent movies, it's better to just mentally erase them.<br/><br/>The films also celebrate Native American art. Alien creator H.R. Giger was a great admirer of pre-Columbian art, and based the alien design partly on the stone reliefs of the Chavín culture, a pre-Inca Andean society. One creature in Chavín art is notably depicted with a mouth within its mouth.<br/><br/>Considering these things adds layers of appreciation for the viewers.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Aliens"" works because the filmmakers set out to make a good movie, rather than crank out a sequel simply to cash in on the success of its predecessor."

","This film is arguably the best sci-fi action film ever made to date. Here is a problem with reviewing it - everyone is comparing it to Alien. Understandable but try considering them as different films. Alien was an atmospheric horror, slow paced reliant on suspense. Aliens is an action film, using the background of what we already know about the Alien species to create a different type of film. Lets face it in Alien the crew were unarmed and untrained, failing I destroy the creature is the theme though out the legacy so the next logical step was to see what would happen if a human population was exposed to it.<br/><br/>Now as a sci-fi action it has everything. The sets are superb, the lighting and sound is atmospheric and terrifying. The new ideas about the nest and queen are fantastic and lead to some of the most iconic moments in movie history. This film is coming up to 30 years old now and is still holding to the test of time. Nothing made since this movie even comes close to taking its crown."

","Whilst in 1999's ""Alien"" most of the time we're expecting for the big thing, this one is the opposite. We have aliens here and there every time, with much more action than the first installment. One thing to praise in this picture is the GREAT direction James Cameron showed; he knows how to make suspenseful scenes and a well built atmosphere. Actors are also very professional and do their job as we expect. Everything was going very fine to me, until Ripley decided to go back to the infested ""plane"" to save that annoying little girl. It sounded SO Cliché that I almost gave up on this. Surely it doesn't spoil the movie's quality in general, but it lost some points with me after that. Also, it's irritating that when we think the movie is over, Cameron revives a monster or create a new one out of nowhere. All in all, it is a great movie, but I still stick to the first version."

","'Aliens' is undoubtedly one of the greatest action films ever made. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role of Warrant Officer Ellen Ripley and the film's action picks up fifty-seven years after the first film when her craft is intercepted by another spacecraft. She is woken from hypersleep to be not hailed as a hero and survivor but as someone who destroyed a very expensive spaceship. To add insult to injury she is then asked to confront her deepest fear once more by going up against the beast that almost killed her all those years ago.<br/><br/>The aliens' home planet of Acheron has been colonised but contact has recently been lost with the colonists. Ripley is asked by corporate smoothie Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) to accompany a team of heavily-armed marines to journey to the planet and find out what has become of the people who settled there.<br/><br/>Once the action kicks off it never lets up until the breathtaking final battle betwixt Ripley and the Alien Queen, an astonishing creation by the late special mechanical effects wizard Stan Winston. Weaver delivers another bravura performance as the 'alpha female' Ripley; and there is fantastic support from director James Cameron regulars Michael Biehn as the tough Corporal Dwayne Hicks; Lance Henriksen as Bishop, a gentle android; and Bill Paxton as the loudmouth Private Hudson. Jenette Goldstein is great as Private Vasquez, a kickass tomboy who is very much just one of the guys.<br/><br/>This is a roller-coaster ride which will blow your mind. James Cameron just keeps outdoing himself. He was recently named 'the most powerful person in film' and deservedly so. Enjoy."

","After the tense, nerve-shredding terror of Alien, James Cameron cranks up the volume and delivers a sequel of pure action and testosterone-singed entertainment. Thrilling action sequences, compelling characters and a determined extraterrestrial enemy will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is superb as Ellen Ripley, her metamorphosis into a tough-as nails lioness remains the archetypal blueprint for future action heroines that the female generation can root for. Her maternal connection with Newt (played with adorable blue-eyed cuteness by Carrie Henn) is given time to develop, ultimately showing us that we humans would do anything to protect the ones we care for.<br/><br/>The supporting cast do more than play their roles so well, we get a good in-depth look at their characterisations. Michael Biehn shines as the quiet and sensitive Hicks, Lance Henriksen excels as Bishop, the reliable android, Jeanette Goldstein holds her own as the tough, Latino smart-gunner Vasquez and Bill Paxton steals the show as the swaggering Hudson.<br/><br/>Though we get small glimpses of the vicious Xenomorph menace, Cameron shows more than enough to make viewers jump in sheer fright. The Alien Queen is a frightening sight to behold.<br/><br/>Part sci-fi and part war movie, Aliens is a roller-coaster thrill-ride of a cinematic experience that demands repeat viewings.<br/><br/>Quite possibly, the greatest sci-fi sequel ever made."
"bobsgrock","9","0","0","25 May 2010"," Cameron shows tremendous stride early on.
","It is quite hard to believe this is just the third full-length feature film James Cameron ever made after the first Terminator and his ultra- low budget Piranha film. Yet, this sequel to Ridley Scott's sci-fi horror movie Alien is beyond anything fans of the series or straight action fans could hope for. Certainly if you haven't see it by now, you owe yourself that favor. While the first relied more on quiet tension and dark corners to introduce its horror, this sequel starts out as such with no aliens even making an appearance until after the first hour. After that though, it's all war.<br/><br/>This is the sixth James Cameron film I have seen and his talent continues to amaze and astound me with every movie I watch. His vision is so unique, so ambitious that even if the story is less than impressive (a la Avatar), I cannot deny the incredible attention to detail and outstanding production designs implemented in this film. The buildup Cameron creates is breathtaking. Just when you think boredom will set in, something happens and it isn't a simple alien jumping out at you either. Imagination is crucial here as we are forced to try and paint a picture in our own mind what is happening, only for Cameron to blow us away in the final third of the film with some of the greatest action sequences ever created. <br/><br/>Another element that separates Aliens from other standard, cardboard sci-fi action movies is the emotional factor, which most movies have none of. Cameron includes a young girl taken under Ripley's wing to maintain audience emotional involvement the rest of the way through. What also sustains our involvement is the performance of Sigourney Weaver, perfectly cast as Ellen Ripley who maintains her tough exterior but isn't afraid to show her maternal side to the young girl.<br/><br/>I really cannot praise this film enough. Sure, some will be turned off by the fact that the last half of this film is essentially one long action sequence that is very violent and over-the-top. However, I praise Cameron for doing this mainly for two reasons: it is extremely well- done, and it never loses steam. So many other movies of this genre are poorly made, unable to have any sort of staying power in terms of its suspense and excitement and by the end essentially give up altogether if only to wrap up the film. Cameron is so far beyond what directors like Roland Emmerich are capable of it's not funny. His films demand to be seen, enjoyed and repeated. Aliens is no exception and for my money, stands just behind 2001: A Space Odyssey as the greatest science fiction film ever made."

","James Cameron's follow-up to Ridley Scott's classic original is not so much a haunted-house horror movie as a shoot-em-up actioner. Cameron though does build up the tension excellently, enhancing the story and developing Weaver's iconic Ripley character while at the same time introducing a bunch of far more interesting characters rather than the simple fodder of the first film where the alien was the star of the show. They make the film entertaining, packing it with gung-ho machismo and bad-ass one liners but when the action comes it is, in my opinion, disappointing.<br/><br/>The alien as we found out in the first film is a terrifying horror Sci-Fi invention but here it plays second-fiddle, becoming nothing more than an extra being blown away like a bad guy in a Schwarzenegger movie. Also Cameron seems to cut away from the best action so you don't have an idea what is going on half the time and the film's latter half spends most of the time building to the inevitable predictable narrative peril scenario. However, Cameron is no doubt a deft-hand at creating palpable claustrophobia and a grand-stand finale and in this sense Aliens doesn't disappoint."

","James Cameron, the action director of the 80's (and now the 90's), has done it again with this sequel to the very suspenseful 1979 film. Its action sequences are unparalleled (apart from ""The Terminator"" films) all being, as per vintage Cameron, excellently choreographed.<br/><br/>This new directors cut does give depth to the characters of 'Ripley'(Sigourney Weaver) and 'Newt'(Carrie Henn), but it makes the film too long. All the added footage is unnecessary, as ""Aliens"" is essentially an action film, and it is in this mode that it works best. For mine, stick with the original version.<br/><br/>The whole cast is very convincing, the special effects (especially 'Alien' effects) are top notch and James Horner's music works very well. A taught, relentless actioner that never lets up once it finds top gear.

"horrorfan1023","8","0","0","3 July 2007"," Beautiful, the best of the sequels!
","I've watched this movie many times, and I still am amazed at the quality of the work Jim Cameron has put out here. ""Aliens"" does not surpass its predecessor, ""Alien,"" in scares; but it beats it by a land-slide in the action department. I personally prefer the creature design in ""Alien"" over the ones in this one. In ""Aliens"", the creatures looked nothing more than like mutated, wing-less bees. It's always a pleasure to see Lance Henriksen on the big-screen. He excelled as Bishop, the android. Same for Michael Beihn as Corporal Hicks, the tough/nice guy of the bunch. He and Sigourney Weaver had great chemistry together. Sigourney herself portrayed Ripley beautifully in this one, just as she did in the original. Ripley is the role Sigourney was born to play, and this movie is proof. As for Newt, I personally am not a fan. I'll be honest, I never was. She came off as whiny, and most of her lines were just screaming people's names (and in that aspect of the role, Carrie Henn did a good job)! But, she was a necessary evil to give Ripley a daughter figure, since you find out her own daughter died earlier in the film. ""Alien"" IMO, is the best in the series, but ""Aliens"" is the best of its sequels. 3 & 4 do not compare to this one. ""Aliens"" was, and forever shall be, such a good sequel any future ones will not stand a chance in dethroning it."

"robb_772","7","0","0","25 May 2006"," Effective combination of SCI-FI and action
","Director James Cameron's follow-up to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi classic ALIEN wisely avoids the potentially fatal error of attempting to recreate the original film's style and structure, and successfully strives for something completely different. Instead of a brooding, space-age horror movie like the first film, ALIENS actually plays like a war movie in space. The emphasis is more on action than terror, and this new direction works surprisingly well even if Cameron's clunky dialogue often thuds. While it may lack the much of the haunting aura and ""art house"" inventiveness of the first film, ALIENS delivers on all accounts when it comes to breathtaking action and suspense.<br/><br/>In an Oscar-nominated performance, Sigourney Weaver is absolutely sensational as the returning Lt. Ripley. Although some may complain that Weaver's RAMBO-esquire physical feats are nothing more than the continued macho-ization of women (and they would have a valid point), I defy anyone who questions the credibility of this actress' commanding performance. I typically loath it when films of this genre attempt to incorporate ""cute"" kids into the action, and nine-year-old Carrie Henn is a bit too sticky sweet for my taste, although her presence in the film does eventually provide a satisfying emotional playoff. The remainder of the cast includes a likeably varied group of put-on heroes, with Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein all turning in memorable portrayals.<br/><br/>In 1991, Cameron released his ""Director's Cut"" of the film, which over 17 minutes of previously cut footage. Most of the film's fans consider this extended cut to be the definitive version of the film, yet I personally have some reservations about some of the re-added scenes. While the many moments of character development (like Ripley adjusting to the fact that so much time has passed since her previous adventure, and a surprisingly moving moment when Hicks and Ripley exchange first names) are terrific (and probably should have never been cut), but the scene where Newt's family discovers the aliens was better left to the imagination. I personally feel that the original theatrical cut should be watched first, but, either way, ALIENS remains one the finest sci-fi actioners."

And aside from critical acclaim. The movie for being R rated was well liked by children, enough that they merchandised for them. I still have a few of the action figure space marines.

The barren planet LV-426 from the original has been colonized. No one knows what danger the planet harbours, until Ripley, the only surviver of the first movie, is found in an escape pod, floating in deep space. No one believes her stories about the alien, until all contact with LV-426 is lost. The Company sends her, along with a hardened group of Colonial Marines, back to LV-426.

","James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is, in my humble opinion, the definitive Humans vs. Aliens movie. As far as I'm concern, every film that has come after ""Aliens"" are inferior clones. Even the animated ""Final Fantasy"", for all of its cinematic breakthroughs, was nothing more than a rich man's ""Aliens."" It's no surprise then that ""Aliens"" is the film by which I measure all Humans vs. Aliens movies.<br/><br/>What makes ""Aliens"" a classic is how it brilliantly lulls you into its world with a sense of security before assaulting your senses with a barrage of American firepower, acid-spewing aliens, and claustrophobic tension. In fact, the movie doesn't even kick into high gear until well after the 50-minute mark, but as soon as that happens, the film never relents. The way the film manages to sustain its high-octane power, while never compromising on its quiet, personal moments, is just incredible.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is James Cameron's sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 ""Alien"", a cerebral experience that attempted to scare with atmosphere and paranoia. ""Aliens,"" on the other hand, is content to thrill with firepower. The film brings back Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the only survivor from the first film, who has been frozen in cryo sleep for the last half century or so. Awaken into a new world she is ill-prepared for, Ripley is informed that the alien planet where the alien creature that terrorized her commercial vessel (from the first film) came from has since been colonized by humans. Oh, and it just so happens that said colony has gone off the radar, and the colonists are believed...in trouble.<br/><br/>Ripley is asked to return to the alien planet as a guide to check up on the colonists. She is hesitant at first, but eventually agrees out of a need to resolve unfinished business (of the personal and alien-killing variety, natch). The bulk of the rescue crew consists of Marines, including the easygoing Hicks (Michael Biehn), the loudmouth Hudson (Bill Paxton), and the inexperienced commander, Gorman (William Hope). No sooner does the crew land on the planet that it becomes apparent things have gone terribly wrong. In fact the colonists are either all dead, fed on, or are being used as breeding apparatus by the aliens! ""Aliens"" is the perfect title for this movie. Whereas part one was called ""Alien"", properly denoting the single alien creature in that movie, ""Aliens"" is literally crawling with the alien creatures. They are everywhere -- on the ceiling, along the walls, and in the shadows. Under Cameron's direction, the aliens are frighteningly real, physical, and in your face. They move with the speed of snakes and kills with the ferocity of tigers, but what really makes them a formidable foe is their cunning. These bastards are smart, has mastered organization, and there are a lot of them.<br/><br/>Once the first mini-gun opens fire, ""Aliens"" shifts into action mode. At nearly two hours and 20 minutes, the movie lives up to the original film and, in my opinion, surpasses it. This is no cerebral experience, this is full-tilt action at its finest. Best of all, Cameron and his crew has the cast and the budget to pull off everything they wanted. Even more impressive is that this is only Cameron's second movie, the first being ""The Terminator"". (Cameron actually shot, edited, and released ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"" back-to-back. He was also the writer of 1986's ""First Blood,"" the first ""Rambo"" movie. How's that for a banner year?) Besides making a star out of Sigourney Weaver as one of the first woman in cinematic history to kick ass and take names on an epic scale, the film features perhaps the finest and most memorable character to sci-fi fans everywhere. Bill Paxton (""Frailty"") is Hudson, the loudmouth who utters some of the most memorable lines in all of sci-fi, including but not limited to his mantra of, ""Game over, man! Game over!"" after the alien army has all but destroyed his unit.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is good stuff. No, let me rephrase that. ""Aliens"" is great stuff."

","Aliens is probably the best sci-fi/horror/action movie combination made to date. Its pacing is near perfection with great acting all around from the Sigourney Weaver down to extras. It has the right blend of action, suspense, and horror never overdoing it. It never strays from its focus and constantly involves the viewer in the outer-world futuristic atmosphere. The production design, like Alien is fabulous once again - with FX still well done by today's standards - this goes as a case in point of how live puppetry, modeling, and costuming with a lot of attention to detail easily outdoes today's CGI which is while nice to look at - doesn't bring the same level of realism. Any fan has seen Aliens more than 10x at least. People who rate this against its predecessor are missing the point, that both are equally effective movies while the subsequent movies (Alien 3, Alien Resurrection) are poor and jumbled with effects\acting going downhill. Its no wonder either since Alien and Aliens were directed by Scott and Cameron respectively - tops in the business. Aliens is not for the easily scared - it is an intense viewing experience giving it muster, energy, and force. I'm happy to have it in my collection, and enjoy revisiting it from time-to-time.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie and enjoy action, suspense, science-fiction, and horror treat yourself to this creme-de-la-creme, it wont disappoint."

Maybe a scare-the-hell-out-of-you don't look experience would be more apt. Whoever made the monsters did a bang-up job in the realism department. This is on a scale with ""Jurassic Park."" You know, if there are movies that can really give us nightmares, ""Aliens"" is right on top. One of the cool things about this movie is that you don't have to be a sci-fi fan to be drawn into the story. It happens in the future, so what? It could be happening now. It's out of this world. It could be anywhere. The acting is great, as when Sigourney comforts the little girl Newt. We have no idea whether anybody is going to get out alive. There are surprises and excitement that are unmatched in most film. This is probably too personal a review to be included in any dissemination of comments. It's just a great movie!"

","Aliens is a perfect 10 sci-fi flick.<br/><br/>first saw this one in the movie theater, and it shocked me so badly that i gripped my seathandles! sucks you in with stunning visuals (remember this was produced in 1986 and the space sequences STILL look awesome!), solid plot, and character development (something you don't see in 99% of Hollywood sci-fi...)<br/><br/>hell, almost 20 years later i can still quote Vasquez' body armor (El Riesgo Siempre Vive! Adios!); from the ""loader"" to the weapons, the technical crew spared nothing to create a believable environment for the movie (the ""making of"" special on Aliens goes into greater detail on how they wanted to create a totally-believable set - and succeeded!) great dialog, tech-jargon, and inter-personal character relationships (i can still remember Vasquez and Hicks and Hudson interacting).<br/><br/>oh, don't forget to catch Jame's Cameron's Terminator reference in the drop-ship scene (Hudson: ""we got phase-plasma rifles..."")"

","This movie is absolutely terrific! Wonderful! In my opinion it's Cameron's Best Film! Whenever I see it, I just have to smile. I personally like this better than Alien. Granted, I love 'em both, but when push comes to shove, (you got to do what you love) I like Aliens better. I just like the style better. But, in my opinion, Alien was scarier, but Aliens I felt had more depth to it. What with the characters. The relationship with Ripley and Newt as well as Ripley and Hicks was very strong, and I felt added more to the depth of the film. Which I thought was great. For me it is impossible to not like Newt. She's just too innocent, and Hicks was just awesome, a real great guy, which made the opening of Alien 3 hard on me, to see them just get killed like bugs. I liked the distrust with Ripley to Bishop, but it's kind of a shame that as soon as she trusts him, BOOM! He's ripped in half. Gorman was so cowardly it was funny, but he redeemed himself in the end, Hudson was just so whiny and hilarious! EG, ""Game over, man! It's game over!"" But he wasn't whiny like Lambert in Alien. She was annoying. He was funny. Vasquez was cool, once she got her head. Up until the drop ship crash, she was a little to sure of herself. And it was a little sad to see Drake die, and Vasquez shout ""NO!"" from the APC. Burke was such a slime ball it was kinda funny, and the rest of the characters were kinda dust in the wind. It kind of seemed like Hicks and Frost were friends, but they never really implemented it. Ferro was too stubborn, hence her letting the alien on board, thus causing the drop ship crash, and the rest were pretty much no-liners. But nonetheless, this is a great movie, and if you like action or sci-fi, or just movies in general, see it!"

","I see that readers give Alens as high a rating as the original Alien. I found the sequel to be a formulaic ""action thriller"", very predictable- the editing blizzards shots- the clash of the main protagonists in the penultimate scene- all right out of the ""action"" formula. The Ridley maternal themes were good but there is often a nurturant-rescue subtext in action thrillers. While Alien simply showed you that Ridley was both a woman and a leader, the sequel had to have the gratuitous dialog's scene on the topic for those who didn't get the point. I really felt that Aliens was a dumbeb down version of the original without the true uniqueness of the original. Part of that was the change of directors. James Cameron is no Ridley Scott. Cameron went on to make Titanic which shows his nose for commercialism, Scott made Blade Runner, another true original. Part of it too, is simply using more conventional commercial formulas- action thrillers appeal to the target demographic- young males even if we continue to see the same plot and script with minor alterations for the 100th time."

"baseballguy11avp","10","0","0","30 March 2005"," James Cameron's Best Film!
","This movie is possibly one of the greatest films ever, it is truly James Cameron's best piece of work through his years of directing. This movie is a sequel to classic 1979 sci-fi picture ALIEN directed by Ridley Scott and the sequel Aliens was made in 1986. This movie is about a group of marines that travel back to the planet from the ALIEN film in an attempt to destroy unknown alien creatures. The amount of action and suspense that this film has brought was outstanding and the over all story of the film has made it a great sequel to the original alien movie. The original alien creature was by H.R. Giger but the person who changed the aliens design for Aliens was the miraculous Stan Winston. He had changed the design by the giving the aliens no domes and other little things that made them look much more creature like and more menacing which in my perspective, they looked much better and this was one of Stan Winston's best creature designs. This film also starred Sigourney Weaver who was from the original Alien movie, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, & Bill Paxton which by far was all there best performance in any movie. So for any body who hasn't seen Aliens then I suggest that you go and by the film and then I'm positive that you will enjoy every last second of it and will wish that it would never end."
"TheNorthernMonkee","9","0","0","20 March 2005"," Second part of the series to loose sleep over
","SPOILERS In the worlds of science fiction and horror, there are few films which can terrify as much as the Alien films can. Starring Sigourney Weaver, the series has declined in recent films, but it's first two outings were magnificent films which scare audiences throughout.<br/><br/>In ""Aliens"", Ellen Ripley (Weaver) has been recovered from the deep sleep that she entered in ""Alien"". Informed she has been in stasis for over half a century, Ripley is even less pleased to hear that the original planet from the first film has now been colonised. When the colony's communications abruptly end however, she once again finds herself forced to combat against the nightmarish species.<br/><br/>After the genius of the first film, few probably could have expected James Cameron to have pulled off such a masterful sequel. Continuing on from Ridley Scott's dark and sinister ""Alien"", Cameron adopted the series as his own and breathed new life into it. Replacing the slow, dark pace with more violence and gore (a technique he would then follow with the dark and moody ""Terminator"" and it's action packed sequel), Cameron offers us an amazing cinematic experience, and we love him for it.<br/><br/>Once more playing a character she is known to love (and is considering starring as yet again), Sigourney Weaver is superb as Ellen Ripley, a strong willed woman who is ultimately the victim of unfortunate circumstance. Weaver plays the character so well that often it is hard to tell whether she is actually as strong as she tries to imply, or if she is more of an anti-hero who doesn't belong in her surroundings. Weaver shows us a contradictory Ripley, an enigma who we can never fully understand, because it's unlikely she even understands herself.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" also benefits from having such a good supporting cast. Whilst in the original, the support is best remembered for John Hurt's legendary final dinner, this second group is a much more varied bunch of characters. Led by the superb Michael Biehn (used by Cameron previously in the original ""Terminator""), the cast contains an emotional wreck of a soldier, a greedy opportunist, a strong female marine and another robot. A vastly varied bunch, so many of the characters are well written and acted that you genuinely care when the predictable casualties start to occur.<br/><br/>As with the original film, the special effects are also top notch in the sequel. Rather than being dependent upon having to find a budget for one single alien, in this outing we are given aliens numbering in their hundreds. Lethal killing machines, the aliens have a specific movement pattern and are brilliantly shown and the special effects people in charge of this film deserve more praise than can ever be truly handed out.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is perhaps one of the finest horror and science fiction films ever made. Whilst it is impossible to truly compare ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" because they are such radically different films, everyone has their personal preference. As a well written story, the first film just edges this one. If you want large amounts of action and bloodshed however, ""Aliens"" might very well be the greatest film of it's genre."

","How often does a sequel live up to, or even surpass its predecessor. The answer is quite simply, rare and Aliens is one of those rarities.<br/><br/>Set 57 years after Ripley's original encounter with cinema's most notorious intergalactic beastie, she is awoken from hyper-sleep to do battle with not just one, but an entire horde of intergalactic beasties. This time she is sent with a bunch of marines to the planet where she first unwittingly picked up the original alien as contact with a colonial crew based there has been lost. When they arrive, there appears to be no one there so they have to search the entire complex. They eventually come across a little girl called Newt (Carrie Henn). After a while they locate some of the crew. This then sets the ball rolling as they discover that there are not alone.<br/><br/>Aliens is a completely different film from Ridley Scott's original. It is essentially a war film with humans invading the aliens home turf as it were and they are fighting back. It has the elements of sci-fi and horror too. Scott's film is essentially a haunted house in space and focuses more on the horror aspects. It would be unfair to say which one is better as both directors have different visions and these two films are totally different from each other. It's down to personal preference as to which one is someone's favourite as both Scott and James Cameron have their own fan base.<br/><br/>Aliens is best seen in its special edition form as it elaborates more on the relationship between Ripley and Newt. It gives more of a back story to the two characters as well.<br/><br/>This film is definitely well worth an inclusion in any film buffs catalogue of great films."

Also, there's a piece of music used here that you can find used in numerous trailers. Sigourney Weaver is the ultimate icon of female power, especially when it gets down to the final climactic battle with the Queen Alien. Speaking of the Queen, I've never seen a creature so scary and feminine at the same time. After watching the film, I assure you that it won't leave you unaffected.

I felt the same at once. But now I know why people went to see it. James Cameron does an excellent job in continuing the Alien saga, from 1979. In this fine instalment, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has now escaped from the disaster back in the first film, and luckily, her escape pod docks with a large space centre, where she is saved. Marines want to (Spoiler) go back to the planet LV-426, not knowing that it is infested with deadly Aliens. A small colony of people living on this planet lose contact with Ellen's new friends, and the Marines have an excuse to check the planet out, with Ripley accompanying them. The Marines don't realise the battle that awaits them.... <br/><br/>Stan Winston, the special effects creator of other hits like Terminators 1 and 2, does a stunning job to make the Aliens look real in this film. He combines animotronics with puppets and other effects to deliver an exceptionally real film, which backs the debate that using puppets and animotronics is far better than CGI (computer generated images). The most impressive use of puppets is the 'mother alien' as seen towards the end of the film, which is very realistic<br/><br/>The acting is also up to scratch. Weaver plays a good part, still playing her heroic role, whilst at the same time, being a caring guardian to the character 'Newt', a little girl who is a survivor of the disappearing colonies. Bil Paxton, also seen in the mixed reviewed Titanic, plays a good character, being a slightly eccentric soldier of the Marines. As ever, he plays a good role. Three characters from the Terminator saga are also included in this film - Micheal Biehn teams up with Sigourney Weaver in parts, and we get hints that they love each other, but its not to be. Lance Henriksen plays a good android who (Spoiler) is an improved model from the one on Ripleys ship in the first film. And finally, Jenette Golstein plays a tough Marine and says one of the best comebacks to an insult I've ever heard:<br/><br/>Paxton: ""Have you ever been mistaken for a man? Goldstein: ""No, have you?<br/><br/>Overall, this film doesn't disappoint. It is not as long and drawn out as Alien, and delivers plenty of action. Overall, Its a hit!"

From the beginning when its successor touched on a place for horror films never looked at before (space), to the true depth of realism created through out the sequels. One thing of note in this sequel is that unlike the first one, where Weaver played a decidedly female role, running and screaming when people got killed, is that in this one she has a much more developed and butch character. You truly get the sense that the prior engagement with the xenomorph has changed her psychologically forever. With the introduction of her nightmares, to simply knowing that an entire elite Marine force is no match for the creature, you become adhered to Ripley. You WANT her to win.<br/><br/>I guess the one problem I have with the movie is that the Marines are nearly all wiped out in the span of their first engagement with the alien, but with the use of brilliant directing and cinemotagraphy, it is totally believable, while hitting you with the feeling that the situation is truly hopeless. Face it. You've just seen nearly an entire squad of war hardened Marines wiped out by beings that don't even know how to use a gun. It is truly awe inspiring to see the aliens melting out of what you once thought was a wall.<br/><br/>As always the sets and aliens themselves are modeled with the help of HR Geiger, and probably will make the man a millionaire for the rest of his life. <br/><br/>A beautifully bleak, eerie and suspenseful film.

Still though what you came to see is also present...future army guys (the marines) going against an army of aliens.  Still the movie builds up rather slowly at first, this lures you into the world of the alien, then it rockets you in with a fire fight where you see very little of the aliens, then finally there is an all out assault.  I will not say much about this assault, but to say the marines do not do to well.

This time around James Cameron takes over the directorial reins in this typical 80's gung-ho and pseudo-patriotic sci-fi/horror film.

","""This Time, It's War!"" After the 1979 release of Alien, which became a sci-fi classic and launched the careers of Sigourney Weaver and director Ridley Scott, fans were eagerly awaiting a sequel to this masterpiece. But the years went by without any news of any sequels until 1983, when James Cameron, a then-unknown director who was awaiting Arnold Schwarzenegger to finish filming Conan The Destroyer to begin work on his second picture called The Terminator. Execs at 20th Century Fox hired James Cameron to write the screenplay for the sequel to Alien and gave him the opportunity to direct the sequel if The Terminator became a success. James Cameron picked up where Alien left off and started writing the script that follows Ripley, the only survivor of The Nostromo, who ends up on a space station who immediately questions her about the alien, the destruction of the ship and the fate of the crew. After her story is told, the company revokes her pilot license, leaving Ripley without any work. Being hunted by nightmares of the alien creature, Ripley joins a crew of soldiers to investigate LV-426 after losing contact with the planet. Upon arriving on LV-426, they will soon discover that they are not aloneJames Cameron gave it a very clever titleAliens. The title says it all: they're will be more than one alien. Naturally The Terminator became a worldwide hit and James Cameron was awarded Aliens as his next project and he knew how to make it somehow better than the original. Alien was a very scary, suspenseful, intense horror/sci-fi film and keeping it in that direction would be a mistake, but James Cameron created an action-packed sequel that would blow everyone's mind by putting more aliens, more action, more suspense, more thrills, more scares and more acidSigourney does an even-better work as Ripley in Aliens. She even was nominated for an Academy Awards as Best Actress. Although Alien was more scary and gory than its sequel, Aliens is one of the best sequels ever made and deserves recognition for its better-than-better special effects by Stan Winston, especially the design of the alien queen. I will give Aliens a 9.0/10, which is what I also give to Alien, since they are both equally good and exciting."

","Aliens is a superb film. Years after its release, there hasn't been a movie to match the fantastic display of film-craft in Aliens. There have been plenty of imitators, and its influences are still going strong in movies today.<br/><br/>Like a lot of fans, I much prefer the original theatrical cut of Aliens - despite all the words from director James Cameron on the extended version, the original is tighter and, well, perfect (and finally available in a recent DVD release; the Special Edition VHS disappointed me for years). It's obvious why the additional scenes were cut; they don't add anything and slow the pace of the film.<br/><br/>Awesome visual effects, great script, cool characters, loads of aliens (the original Alien's one alien and overall film pales in comparison to this; and Aliens is a scarier ride than the first), excellent direction from James Cameron - my favorite film from him, and definitely one of my all-time favorite movies!"

","I've been a big fan of the ""Alien"" series for many year.  I even enjoyed the much-derided ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection"".  This has to be the best of the series to date, though.  In this film director James Cameron does what he does best - hard-edged science-fiction action with great special effects.<br/><br/>Set 57 years after ""Alien"", series heroine Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) accompanies a platoon of space marines to planet LV-426 (where the original alien was found) to investigate the loss of contact with an Earth colony that has been established there.  No prizes for guessing what has happened to them.<br/><br/>There is more of everything in this film, compared to the first:  More aliens, more firepower, more humans to be preyed on.  As a result, ""Aliens"" is not actually as scary as ""Alien"", but then it isn't really supposed to be scary.  This is a war movie in space.<br/><br/>For a film that's nearly twenty years old, it has aged suprisingly well. Some of the aliens do occasionally look like men in costumes, and Paul Reiser's villainous yuppie is very 1980s, but otherwise it still looks great.  <br/><br/>The Alien Queen is one of the highlights of the ""Alien"" series."

Signorney Weaver reprising her role Ripley and receiving an Oscar Nomination for Best Actress (Very unusual for a movie of this Genre) James Horner's music is also great and also receiving an Oscar Nomination for Best Music.

","What the first one lacks, the 2nd one got, what the 2nd one lacks, the 1st one got.. That's how to sum it up really.<br/><br/>While Alien 1 was a psychological ride, this movie is plain action, and with James Cameron in the lead it's pretty damn good action.<br/><br/>I've heard many say this is the best action movie ever, and i partly agree, but i still think Terminator 2 is better, and also some newer movies are very impressive generally due to the development within special effects, but no doubt, this is a thrill ride, and it's very experimental with camera work, and the effects are actually pretty well made, and the ""monster"" looks way more convincing than the 1st one, although they show to much of it here, it looks good, but not THAT good, they should have shown it less and also that way perhaps build more on the psychological part of like the 1st one. ""The most frightning thing is what the eye can not see"".<br/><br/>
Now as the topic says the ending of this movie is great, and hell yeh, the last 1/3 of the movie it's just to lean back and get on the ride, because from here there is no stopping, one of the best endings for this genre i have ever seen, and may i mention the best scene is when the girl and Ripley is stuck inside this room, where there are two, what appears to be, giant spiders, they were pretty creepy.<br/><br/>Final i think this movie is definitely one of those to remember everytime you go into an action movie, you don't see a lot of action movies that works as well as this one, even now almost 20 years later it's still as good as the ones coming out today, the acting was a bit so-so, but that isn't the essence of this movie anyway, it's basically just a action ride from start to end, with a damn good storyline.<br/><br/>9/10"
"amgardner1","Null","0","0","22 February 2004"," Top three faves
","Ever since I first saw this film it somehow ended up on my top three list of movies(including Akira and theAbyss) Not only is Cameron a fantastic Film-maker, but also an unabashed fan. Watch Alien, then watch this film. While not superior, Aliens matches (or even surpasses) the intensity and rawness of the first film, (and how could a sequel match the ingenuity of the first?Dan O'Bannon wrote the script of the original film while suffering from acute stomach pain).. This is how sequels should be made. How to possibly expand on the original?  How about a hardcore bunch of Marines sent to exterminate the alien(unamerican)threat, that soon succumbs, leading Ripley(Weaver) to once again take charge. But unlike the first film, Ripley becomes not just the sole survivor, but the sole believer in the true threat. They even make the ultimate insult and deny that what she experienced actualy happened! In other words, Cameron both makes a loyal sequel, but also sets the template for every action movie to come post 1986! (not even close to expressing my full adoration of this film) DrewGardner"
"turing77","Null","0","0","16 February 2004"," We all know how good this is.
","If anyone ever asks for an example of a sequel that is superior to the original, this is your film. Jim Cameron is one of the best directors working today, and this film is his, pure and simple. The subsequent two films (not directed by Cameron) were pretty bad, but this one stands alone. Sigourney Weaver gives a perfect performance, and the rest of the cast is terrific, especially Bill Paxton. This movie never lets you down: once the fantastical elements of the story are established, you believe the characters, you accept their behavior, and you think you are watching ""reality."" A true classic."

","I don't like sequels: Predator 2 and Highlander 2 are just about as bad as it gets - Aliens is different... Whereas Alien was a brilliantly brooding dark film, almost docu-drama in places, Aliens is a rollercoaster of action but it never looses sight of the characters it creates. You really get to care about all of them a lot - even the soldiers who are on the edge of the action like Dietrich. And Burke has to be the only character in any Aliens film where I've been routing for the extra-terrestrials! There are so many electrifying scenes - but the one that still sends a chill down my spine (on the 100th viewing!) is when the Aliens awake for the first time and catch the marines off-guard. Ripley is at her morose best in this film and the growing relationship with Hicks and Newt  - and Bishop -is another significant departure from the original and which builds the series as a whole to another level  (sad then that Aliens 3 smashed away all of the fine building blocks set up by Cameron) A definate must see film!"
"kingtanichi","10","0","0","24 January 2004"," The best movie of the decade
","I have a dirty little secret. It's that I've never been an enormous fan of Ridley Scott's 1979 original. It's a classic, yes. It's a very good film, yes. It deserved more success than it received, yes. But the best thing it did was to pave the way for James Cameron's Aliens. It's here that the real core of the Alien franchise lies.<br/><br/>The basic premise is hardly new. A plot summary would essentially read: ""space soldiers battle killer aliens on a far away planet."" It's simply that Cameron, in the same way he did with Terminator before this, has taken a lot of tired old sci-fi conventions and reinvested some energy and vitality in them. He also keeps the pace ferociously fast, not allowing the movie time to bog down. A case in point is the aliens' double jaw. In the first, Scott meant it to be show-stopping. Here, Cameron simply shows it as just another interesting aspect of action scenes already packed with different elements. It works much better that way.<br/><br/>One of the trademarks of Cameron's films is that he never assumes that just because there's lots of action, we can be fobbed off with cardboard characters. The actors here are given real roles to play, and their characters create genuine sympathy. It's one of the only movies like this I've ever seen where we actually hope the humans live out the movie, rather than rooting for the aliens to tear them apart (like Starship Troopers).<br/><br/>Aliens is a technical masterpiece in every way possible, and a strong dramatic piece too. Nobody who claims to enjoy movies can really justify not having seen it."

","As you may recall, Alien was taut, oppressive, mysterious, etc. While Aliens has some of that it wisely tries not to compete with Alien. It is its own thing. Action - and lots of it - in this fest. Some movies have lots of action but are low on actual thrills. No doubt about it, Aliens is definitely a keeper in any library. <br/><br/>All of the characters are interesting. Not a dog in the lot. The acting is fun and convincing. Even the child was great. Everyone is introduced through situations that make them all very memorable without being mediocre.<br/><br/>The pacing moves along quickly and is practically never dull - at least I was never bored. This is another one of those movies that keeps piling it on. Just when the situation can't get any worse or more thrilling - it does.<br/><br/>
The special effects are top-notch and convincing. The Aliens are also interesting characters as well - not just random murderers. In other words you get more acquainted with the little darlings. Their expanded role allows for them to compound on the interest that may have been generated by viewing the first installment.<br/><br/>Background pretty much stayed in the background. It helped when it was needed otherwise it mostly stayed out of the way. <br/><br/>The overall story was really very good too. It didn't sound stale and  in fact, was almost completely plausible. That's a good thing for SF to do.<br/><br/>Although I didn't do it I think it is entirely possible to watch this movie by itself without having seen the first one and do just fine. The dialogue alone leading up to the eventual reconfrontation with the aliens pretty much explains it - but does it in a way that is fun to review.<br/><br/>
Most everything about this movie - as a sequel- was smart. I gave Alien a 10 for its reasons and I give Aliens a 10 for its own reasons. Two excellent movies."

","This is the best movie (imo) out of the series.  Although Ressurection comes close as my second favorite movie, this is the best.  It has alot more action than its oder brother ""Alien"" and it also shows the alien more often, not just hiding in the shadows.  (No offense to Ridley Scott, your movie is my third favorite, the forth is Predator 1)  Riply is a more of an action heroine in this movie and is more involved in taking part in the operation.  This movie also has an easier plot to follow,  they go in to exterminate the bad boys and girls and things go wrong.  I think things started to go wrong when they found the colonist with the chestburster.  (Hey i am a 13 year old with short term memory, especially when it comes to homework.)  Overall, this is the best out of the series. (as i might of stated but short term memory going again.)

The scenes where everyone was shooting the aliens left and right kept you on the edge of your seat. I think the only character I didn't like was Burke (Paul Reiser). He was a jerk! Whenever Ripley got attacked by that crablike alien that nearly chokes her to death and he turned off the camera when she was crying for help made me want to spit at the TV at him.

This movie is ripe with tense fearful moments and the realism of less special effects than modern cinema combined with tried and true techniques of older cinema. H.R.

But I can tell you that it is gripping, fast-paced, and involves Paul Reiser's death ... a plus in my opinion. The seemingly no-name cast is made up of great supporting actors and Sigourney Weaver is the perfect female-lead again. Bill Paxton's performance is great, Paul Reiser is even half-way decent, and the rest of the cast mesh together in a way that is seldom seen in a movie where so many of them die off so quickly.<br/><br/>The cinematography and setting are well done and the plot is easy to follow and entertaining.

Even James Horner's stirring theme is recycled in action trailers today.  There is certainly great action, and the wisecracking team of Marines, each having a distinct personality (especially the hypochondriac Hudson, the badass Vasquez, and the ass-kissing Gorman), give the movie a great flavor as well as giving each of the viewers a character to relate to.  <br/><br/>In the lead Sigourney Weaver is top-notch as Ripley--she should have one the Oscar--and through her relationship with Newt the film is given the foundation for its theme of motherhood and protection of young. <br/><br/>

","I write this review, on the eve of attending the cinema to watch 'Alien: The Director's Cut'. I have watched 'Aliens' maybe twenty times over the years, but somehow I've never seen the original all the way through, and certainly never at the cinema. Therefore, I am worried that I will think the original is better, in which case I wanted to be able, at least for tonight, to state quite categorically, that 'Aliens' is easily my favourite science fiction movie of all time. Should the original exceed all expectations, at least 'Aliens' will have temporary justice. I don't really understand why 'Aliens' is just so watchable time and again. Maybe James Cameron is a genius, because I do find all of his films obsessive. (I certainly prefer him as a director to Ridley Scott, so I'm not really expecting the original to surpass the sequel!) Maybe it's because the tension is so well staged. Maybe it's the relationship between Sigourney Weaver and 'Newt'. There are so many elements of this movie which make it stand out. Vasquez and Hudson are the most interesting crew members, although the android, played so convincingly by Lance Henriksen, deserves such credit for their mission. Whatever it is, this movie deserves to be held in God-like regard. It also contains the greatest line in movie history, in my opinion. Every time I see that scene, when Ripley disappears to become the human forklift and emerges with those immortal words to the Queen Alien, who is terrorising Newt, I am reminded of how great a film it is.With adrenaline pumping, and armed with those basic, and thankfully,  human traits of bravery and child protection, Ripley issues the command of 'Get away from her, you bitch!' Simple, but words which never fail to make you want her to kick the **** out of old Queenie. 9/10. If the original is better, I'll be posting that review tomorrow..."

","Almost sixty years after destroying her mining ship and the alien invader, Lt. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is discovered in hyper-sleep by a deep space salvage team. Her account of the events leading to the destruction of the alien and the Nostromo are ridiculed by Company executives, partly for the reason that the planet where Ripley claimed to have encountered the parasitic face-huggers has been inhabited for over twenty years. However, when contact is lost with the colonists, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) enlists the help of Ripley and a platoon of space marines to investigate the planet.<br/><br/>James Cameron directed this first sequel to Ridley Scott's Alien' (1979) and it could easily be argued that Aliens' is on-par with the original. Whereas Scott's Alien' was more of a sci-fi/horror movie built on extremely tense and unnerving sequences, Cameron's addition to the series is a high-octane and thrilling sci-fi/action movie featuring hundreds of the alien creatures. Due to hordes of aliens being shown Aliens' as a movie loses any horror aspect, with the exception of the scenes in which the marines first enter the colonists compound. Surprisingly Aliens' is able to limit the appearance of the alien lifeforms for a long time without the movie becoming any less entertaining. Cameron ingeniously re-uses plot elements that made the original so successful and proceeds to attach more of a storyline. The tough chick character of Ripley is given a more maternal side which is shown by her willingness to protect a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) no matter what the danger to herself. This element adds to the character of Ripley and makes for some exhilarating scenes, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>Due to some intelligent storytelling Aliens' is given an atmosphere very similar to its predecessor. The despair and darkness is shown so well and once again, sympathy is felt for some of the characters. While certain characters displayed dislikeable traits early on, their sudden realisation of the hopeless situation they are now in results in somewhat of a kinship developing between the characters and the viewers. Some superb performances from Michael Biehn (of The Terminator' fame) as Cpl. Hicks, Jenette Goldstein as the arrogant but loyal Vasquez and Paul Reiser as the deceitful Carter Burke all help add to the atmosphere and make Aliens' a gripping action/thriller! Sigourney Weaver, of course, stole the show in Aliens' as she had previously done in Alien'. While Alien' hinted at Ripley's more sensitive side the movie concentrated mainly on Ripley as a tough chick. Aliens' gives Weaver a little more to work with and allows her to parade her remarkable acting ability far more than before.<br/><br/>In Aliens' we have a superbly written (credit to James Cameron, Walter Hill and David Giler), directed and acted movie. Cameron sustains a constant air of foreboding doom throughout the movie due to some clever camera work and lighting. The ever present darkness of Aliens' is only eclipsed by the exceptionally directed action sequences. Aliens' also benefits from some outstanding special effects and first-rate work on the alien creature which remains as terrifying and realistic as it appeared to be in the original movie. I highly recommend Aliens' to movie fans and especially those fans of the original movie - it's a different style of movie but still tremendously entertaining. My rating for Aliens'  9/10."

Aliens is THE best blend of action and Sci-Fi that has yet been made. If you like war movies or action movies or Sci-Fi then this is the movie that you've been waiting for. It is easily the best of the Alien films and the best movie that James Cameron has put out. That is saying a lot but Aliens is no ordinary film. I won't go into the plot because if you wanted to know that then you can look elsewhere on the Aliens page but suffice to say the story promises much and delivers in spades. Everyone in the movie makes their character work from all the Colonial Marines to Sigourney Weaver (Ripley) herself. I will always know Paul Reiser as the scumbag Burke and Bill Paxton will always be Hudson no matter what else either of them do. The set design and prop design of this film are a sight to behold and the makers of this film succeeded in making whatever point in the future this movie is set in come to life. (Throughout the Alien series, there is no mention of date, I'm sure there is a tiny reference somewhere but I'm obviously not hardcore enough to sniff it out. If somebody knows let me know.)The design of the Marines armor, weapons, and vehicles delivers special praise because I can really see Marines in the future looking like they do in the film. That they still use projectile weapons is something that I won't even try to get into here. At least they're caseless. The aliens themselves are the greatest contribution to the world that H.R. Giger has ever made, his weird art nonwithstanding. The bio-mechanical look of the aliens is a great design. The whole look of the movie is simply incredible. Bottom Line: This movie rules, buy it and put it on the mantlepiece in a lighted, dust-shielded alcove. Then worship it in a pagan fan-boy ceremony.

In 57 years a lot of things has happend, among that her daughter has died.<br/><br/>Ripley is forced too sit through long meating with 'important' people. They blaim her for the loss of their ship(wich she destroyed in Alien). But then contact is lost with LV-426. She is convinced too go too the planet as an expert, though she will go there with marine soldiers.<br/><br/>As the soldiers and ripley land on the planet, all hell breaks loose...<br/><br/>This film is easily one of the best sci-fiction and action film ever made. The action is very good and very cool.<br/><br/>It is writen and driected by James Cameron, the man who did The Terminator and other films. The script is very good and the characters are very well written. Every single one of them is interesting in their own way.<br/><br/>There is Ripley, wich we know from the first film.<br/><br/>There is Dwayne Hicks, a bad-ass soldier who always stays cool and never panics. This role is played by Michael Biehn, wich plays the part very good.<br/><br/>
There is Hudson, a soldier who we in the begining things is a very bad-ass soildier. He talks about how he will kich ass and all, but when he faces the aliens he shows another side. Bill Paxton is AMAZING in this role.<br/><br/>Vasques, a female soldier. She is a really cool character, who also always stays cool. She is played by Janette Goldstein, who is a very good actress and it is a shame that she doesn't got more roles these days.<br/><br/>These are sme of the characters who are very interesting but there are more.<br/><br/>James Cameron does a good job directing this one. This is, in my opinion, the best Alien movie. This one is maybe the best Cameron film(a tie between T2 and this one), it is Amazing. I really recomend this one. 10/10."

","Possible spoilers. Aliens is as different as possible from its predecessor, Alien. Gone is the creepiness and claustrophobia from the first film. Gone is the excellent characterisation. In fact the only familiar elements from the first film are the creatures themselves and Sigourney Weaver as the sole survivor from the first film. This doesn't mean that the film is bad, on the contrary it is my favourite of the series (but not by much.)The main plot, that a group of gung-ho marines travel to the planet were the aliens were first discovered to rescue a group of colonists only to find themselves facing over a hundred the creatures is not exactly Shakespeare but the action sequences are exhilarating, the aliens (especially the 30ft queen alien) are really well done and James Horner's score is great (my second favourite of his music, the first being Star Trek II the Wrath of Kahn). The acting is mostly good with kudos to Weaver, Bill Paxton as a fear-ridden soldier and Carrie Henn as the little girl who is the sole survivor of the colonists. Unfortunately the scenes between the action sequences do drag a little and some of the model work (such as the marine's dropship overflying the colony) are sub-Thunderbirds. But overall this is an excellent piece of entertainment."

I notice something new every time I watch it.<br/><br/>This movie is approaching it's 20 year mark and I still think the S.E. are right up there with the cutting edge stuff that's coming out now. I long for a film to come out today that would use half of the puppet work, models, miniatures or actual live actors to simulate the aliens. THEY LOOK REAL BECAUSE THEY ARE REAL! (But not really real). Small things like the upturned collar on Burke's suit make me think that Cameron did not let a single thing go unchecked. (I guess the collar is a subtle attempt at showing men's fashion in the future). It looks totally believable and not too in your face, which I guess is why it took me forever to notice it.<br/><br/>The action speaks for itself. If you haven't seen it it, SEE IT. The characters are truly a rarity from many action/adventure movies because we end up really caring about them. Solid acting from all parts, not to mention Weaver being nominated for a Best Actress Oscar. And as far as I'm concerned, this is THE Cameron film with which to compare all Cameron films. Bottom line... so much more than an action/adventure/sci-fi, which is where you'll find it on the rack."

","""Aliens"" is the best one of the series with its unique good versus evil fight to save the universe. Far better than the slow but still quite scary original ""Alien"", this film is extremely well crafted with a lot of action and suspense that keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Just like the tagline says ""This time, it's war"", Aliens is a war movie set in space on the distant planet of LV-426. Sigourney Weaver returns as Lt. Ellen Ripley in this chilling adventure directed by James Cameron co-starring the director's usual cast list Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and Lance Henriksen. <br/><br/>Recovered somewhere in space by the ""company"" after drifting into space for the past 57 years, Lt. Ripley explains her story (from the first movie) to the ""company"" about what happened to the ""Nostromo"". No one believes her and they revoke her lisence as a flight officer indefinitely. When the company loses contact with the colony on LV-426 (planet from the first movie), Ripley is called back into action to assist a group of Marines on investigating the matter. They find out that the colony is crawling with aliens. Will they survive ?<br/><br/>Personaly, I think that Aliens was perfect in every way. James Cameron's direction and screenplay are sharp and the cast is well chosen to impersonate some colorful characters. Stan Winston's special effects are better than ever and James Horner's score is frightening. Even though a violent picture, Aliens develops a nice chemistry between the characters that leads to a nice happy ending. Too bad that ending is screwed up in the beginning of Alien 3. But just don't think about it when your watching this movie. Have fun and enjoy the ride as James Cameron brings you one step further in the Alien Saga."

","(Beware some mild plot spoilers) I think that Aliens is a huge improvement on Alien. Better in many ways although it did lose a lot of tension and horror but more than made up for this in nearly every other way. Maybe I will be a bit biased considering that I think Aliens is the greatest movie ever but don't think I'm a pubescent teenager who loves films where mindless violence occurs eg Starship Troopers (which by the way is also amazingly good fun). I think Aliens is overall superb. It may take roughly 70 minutes for any real action to take place but you're hooked throughout and it doesn't seem slow at all. The movie has some brilliant set pieces including the facehuggers in the medi-lab scene and the end battle. These may not be as infamous as the chestburster scene from Alien but they are still tremendous and in many ways they excel it. I think Alien is the definitive sci-fi film with it's brilliant imagination and freshness which brung about a new era for films about different species. Pure genius."
"Slime-3","Null","0","0","21 May 2003"," Good despite some seriously cliche characters
","Having watched the original ALIEN movie, for the fist time, shortly before catching this one,I was struck by how much more 'Hollywood' the second installment is. The cast of the original were a mixed bag of US and British actors and the quality of acting and characterisation was high. Here the emphasis is on special effects, explosions, guts, gore, destruction and cinematic thrills. The all American cast portray a host of rather predictable characters, often little more than comic book  cutouts. The ""bad-ass"" Marine corps who seems to have wandered in from the set of an overblown Vietnam epic are exactly what you'd expect in this kind of movie and fit the accepted formula. The women fight harder than the men, the big mouth becomes a coward when the chips are down and the rookie commander struggles to keep them in order while undergoing his inevitable rite-off-passage. Yeah yeah,seen it all before...it's well done but riddled with cliques. The action is relentless and ultra violent. The original boasts a good deal more depth in it's story and a level of claustrophobic suspense that really scares the aundience before the blood and gore fest even begins. In many way ALIEN is more traditional science fiction, and thoughtfull, intelligent science fiction at that, but ALIENS is a big screen video game in which the main aim is for the main character to survive an orgy of killing going on all around her! There isn't the thought or imagination of the original movie. In many ways it's a classic sequel - it reuses the ""best bits"" of the original - those remembered most vividly, but drops the vital background detail and characterisation that allowed those steller sequences to achieve their full impact.  Hats off to the special effects people and the art department for a truly vivid nightmare of a movie, but after watching the original , one can see the inherent flaws in this movie, despite it's undoubtedly high production values and box office success."

","Why Alien is always revered to such an extent i find hard to comprehend when Aliens is clearly a more enjoyable film. James Cameron's conceptualisation of the alien creatures is far more interesting for the screen. All the creeping about and setting of the scene in the first installment leaves a viewer quite simply bored. Aliens completely switches genre from sci-fi thriller to sci-fi action movie. Riply (Sigourney Weaver) is given new strength and is perhaps the strongest heroine to hit the screens if not Sarah Connor in Terminator 2 (another of Camerons creations). The effects in this film are still enjoyable to watch today and the aliens themselves are a much bigger feature in this film, hence the name Aliens! Bill Paxton Provides the comical element in the film representing the average person put in a situation as psychologically crippling as one could imagine being trapped on a planet crawling with homocidal aliens might be. This film delivers great actions scenes with plenty of human and alien carnage to satisfy an audiences blood lust, while the balanced structure of the film does not neglect the characters giving more than Ripley an interesting arc. A failure in many action films is when a character is of such little interest to the viewer that you do not care what happens to them (see 'Black Hawk Dawn'). Aliens avoids this trap and is definitely a film that can be enjoyed more than once. 9/10."

","Even after countless viewings, I remain glued to my seat for the duration of this movie.<br/><br/>The first half-hour is a little slow, as the plot slowly unfolds and the links to the first movie are established.  But all of that changes with the introduction of...<br/><br/>THE MARINES!<br/><br/>A tough, colourful, fascinating group that I only wish could have been explored further, the marines make this movie great.  Each character has a different personality, each one a different background, and a combination of acting, writing, and directing talents flesh these characteristics out as much as possible.<br/><br/>Of course, some of them are more interesting than others, and fortunately director James Cameron is wise enough to give the more interesting people more screen time, so we can learn more about them:  <br/><br/>-Michael Biehn, as Hicks, is the strong and silent type. <br/><br/>-Jenette Goldstein, as Vasquez, is the muscular tomboy. <br/><br/>-Al Matthews, as Apone, is the hard-bitten, hard-driving sergeant. <br/><br/>-And, of course, there's Bill Paxton as Hudson, defining forever the role of the cynical yet courageous joker of the group.  Any similar role in any other movie is always and will always be compared to his performance in this film.<br/><br/>Besides the great characters, there is also Cameron's trademark never-stop-once-it-starts action.  The soldiers fight the Aliens for two hours of screen time, and you'll never notice it go by.  In fact, you probably won't want it to end.<br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Aliens' is a great action film and (because they were wise enough not to put the number 2 in the title) it does not have to be seen along with Ridley Scott's staggeringly slow original, nor David Fincher's morbidly depressing follow-up.  It stands alone as a landmark in science-fiction filmmaking, as does so much of Cameron's work.<br/><br/>(And most of all, Sigourney Weaver looks *really* hot in the tank top carrying around the heavy artillery.

","One of the best films of the ""hypersalivating monster attacks you in outer space"" genre, ""Aliens"" is a tightly constructed festival of gore and terror. Some scenes have a palpable intensity: you can really feel the menace of the aliens as they creep, heard but not seen, towards the characters. If these scenes were any more atmospheric, you could smell and taste them as well.<br/><br/>That said, this movie doesn't quite live up to the standard set by ""Alien."" While Ripley is a little more rounded in this film (we find out that she had a daughter, has nightmares, has a first name, etc.), the secondary characters sometimes seem like stock military and corporate types. Bill Paxton's character in particular is irritating because of his overacted macho behavior and panicking. Kudos, though, to the little girl, who is thoroughly convincing in her traumatized-child role. She has been so terrified by seeing so much grisly death that she won't even respond to her rescuers at first. Of course, Sigourney Weaver turns in a bravura performance, as she always has done.<br/><br/>Also, sharp-eared nerds like myself will notice that the music in the opening scene, where Ripley's escape pod drifts through space, was also used in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".

There were greater breaks in the action in Alien and the monster was seen much less (putting the viewer in the same uncertain state as the crew). Aliens is particularly interesting because we learn more about the life cycle and behavior of the creatures.  The addition of the little girl could have turned into something horrible, but Cameron pulls it off and makes a stellar film worth seeing.

","In terms of technique, this film is on par with the original; however, I liked the atmosphere of the original over this sequel.  Subtle, low key exploration films on terror tend to gather my interest more than all out war, but that's not to say I credit Aliens as being any less a sci-fi film than its predecessor.  If i preferred war films, than Aliens would be my favorite out of the series.<br/><br/>Instead of trying to recapture the experience of Alien all over again, James Cameran decides to go for the general dark feel of the original while taking it in a different direction.  Namely by making it an entirely different kind of film from the first.  Aliens is by no means a rehash, nor does it break with the elements that made Ridley Scott's vision such a wonderful experience.  Likewise, James Horner action-war interpretation of Goldsmith's original haunting score accurately captures the new direction of the Aliens experience.<br/><br/>The typical horror sequel suffers from a fatal flaw--it's an absolute remake of the first.  Some kind of killer pops up, starts killing and no one knows what's going on--that's fine for the first film, but when the first four+ films are that exact formula?  No.  It was fine for Alien, but in Aliens it would not work again.  So Cameran lets the characters know the beast they must slay.  The fatal mistake of the characters in Aliens is underestimating the numbers they're up against.  It's an all out war, but with the Aliens its a war of attrition--that's what makes it every bit as engaging as the original.<br/><br/>Also like the first film, the characters as a whole (minus a few individual exceptions) are pretty intelligent in their approach to dealing with the aliens; I found the Aliens characters to be more colorful, a bit more exagerrated, but more memorable than their predecessors.<br/><br/>
Being made 7 years later, the special effects are also have a noticable improvement over its predecessor.  But still, I think Alien and Aliens are neck and neck with each other; it's more a factor of ""what kind of movie do you prefer?"" that will determine which one you like more.  Aliens is a very good sci-fi horror film in its own right, and it's a fantastic sequel, and arguably the best horror-sequel ever made."

","To achieve greatness, let alone relevance, a sequel has to innovate. Think of the very best and you will find they build unexpectedly on existing characters and deepen old themes while exploring new territory. The Godfather II does that, Empire Strikes Back certainly does that, and Aliens undoubtedly succeeds as well.<br/><br/>Fresh of the first Terminator, a young writer-director James Cameron had a broad choice of follow-up projects. It says a lot about the influence and staying power of Ridley Scott's original nightmare that he chose to explore this universe. The stakes are very different, with first opus survivor Ripley (Weaver, Oscar nominated this time around and with reason) is intercepted after a long drift through space and learns that not only was the planet where she encountered the original alien later colonized, said colony has recently gone completely silent. The ominous ""company"" decides to send a platoon of space marines to investigate, preferably with a corporate stooge and Ripley as an adviser along with them.<br/><br/>You'd be forgiven for thinking ""here we go again"" and expecting little in the way of novelty, but Cameron wisely innovates with the tone, knowing full well you can't put the first film's genie back in the bottle. What we have then is not a slasher film in space, but a rescue mission film than deteriorates into a fight for survival. In typical Cameron-fashion, the bad-ass military hardware is glorified at first, before proving cruelly insufficient in the face of an implacable enemy, not just one alien, but overwhelming numbers, undaunted by modern firepower: the best of horror with echoes of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>If Alien is the film that casts a long shadow over the genre, artistically speaking, Aliens is the one people remember for pure visceral thrills, and it is to this second outing that we owe the actual Alien phenomenon, encompassing video games, comics, toys and yet more sequels. In unleashing a strong director with his own voice it set a unique and sadly rarely imitated precedent of making films within a series wildly different from each other, with the courage to experiment with varied tones, looks and ideas in the hands of directors whose voices were quite unique (Scott and Cameron first, followed by Fincher and Jeunet). It is that, not just the monster, that makes it special, and this ingredient we owe to Cameron's caring treatment of the burgeoning saga. Speaking of monsters, we also owe it an evolving of the monster's life-cycle and, idiot savant that he is, Cameron's silliest idea - replacing the mystery of the alien's biology with a bee-hive structure and, in essence, adding the equivalent of a video game boss level to his film in the form of the queen - turns out to be a masterstroke.<br/><br/>This film deserves its status as the most popular in the franchise and is all the validation you need for Cameron's counter to the original Alien's premise. Yes, sometimes less is more. But in this case, as the man said, more clearly was more!"

","ALIENS, that rare bird of a sequel that's better than the original, still stands 12 years later as one of the finest S/F films ever made.  Some call this movie cliched, but fail to realize that this is the movie upon which many of the overused action/adventure cliches are based.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding, led by Oscar nominee Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, only survivor of the first encounter with the acid-blood human-devouring alien race in the first film.  Matching her with equal gusto is Michael Biehn as Marine Corporal Hicks, and the relationship that develops between the two of them is as natural and unforced as any film romance ever conceived.  Paul Reiser as company slimeball Carter Burke will make your skin crawl.  Lance Heinriksen's smoothly cool turn as the android Bishop shows why he is the most criminally underused actor in the business. An early Bill Paxton role as gung-ho-but-terrified Private Hudson shows why he would go on to much greater roles in the future.  There's not a false note in the large and varied cast; even the smaller roles are beautifully played and leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>And THIS is a James Cameron film?  Cameron at once takes this film to a completely different level and shows magnificent restraint when he has to. The scripting is tight, the camera angles are stupendous, the action sequences first rate.  The movie is a fantastic thrill ride, and just when you think you've seen everything, something new grabs you and yanks you along for another set of wild hairpin turns.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this movie, rent it immediately.  Better yet, buy it, because if you like action/adventure or S/F, this film is a required element in your personal film library.  It's as close to perfect as a S/F film gets."
"Mattyproff","Null","0","0","21 May 2002"," wow. Best film ever 11/10
","this is undoutubly the best action/horror/sci-fi flick of the 1980's. Everything from the casting to the storyline was impecebile and James Cameron should be truly proud. Sigourney Weaver again pulls out all the stops and gives a truly heroic and confincing portrayal of Ellen Ripley. Unlike the first one, which was a pure horror film, Aliens has it all from Gun-Blazing battle sequences, to spooky and chilling parts of suspense. Outstanding performances have to go to Weaver, Bill paxton as the 'Bad-ass' private Hudson who consistently moans and complains throughout, Lance Henriksen as the synthetic Bishop, Jeanette Goldstien as fiery tom-boy character Vasquez and Paul Reiser as company scumbag Carter Burke. Cameron has an ability to bring his characters to life in his films. This again is shown in Aliens as you can almost sense what the characters are feeling and thinking at a particular part during the action. Michael Beihn also puts in a  convincing performance as Corpral Hicks, who is forced to take command when Seargent Apone (Al Matthews)is taken away. Aliens is one of many films where there is a few survivors of a massacre and it ends up with each one of them is picked off one by one, but what Cameron has managed to achieve, which many mind numbing hollywood blockbusters have failed to pull off miserably, is allow the characters to build up some sort of bond and chemistry between them( especially privates Hudson and Vasquez as they are constantly nagging at each other). I have seen Alien 3 and wheras it wasn't a complete disaster it didn't achieve the same affect as Aliens, and the less said about Alien Resurrection the better!"

","I just love the atomsphere of this film.<br/><br/>At the begining Ripley does not want to go back and everyone looks at her as this crazy paranoid woman but when it comes to facing the aliens she is the most calmed and actually becomes kind of the leader in this military group. Newt is also one of the best characters and the scenes with her and Ripley are wery emotional but fits so well intoo this dark movie. One of the best lines i think are when Ripley asks:<br/><br/>dont you think you will be safer here with us , these people are soldiers . Then Newt says : it wont make any diffrence.<br/><br/>I love that Ripley, Newt and Hicks survive the film but then David Fincher just had to ruin that.

","Aliens is a favourite. Despite top-notch sets and soundtrack,  the biggest asset is convincing acting. You get the tension between the increasingly freaked-out Marines (""They're gonna get in here and they're gonna kill us!!"" ""SHUT UP!!""). Then there's the chilling Newt (""These marines are here to protect you."" ""It won't make any difference""). And of course, there's Ripley. Cameron almost makes it believable that she would willingly confront the aliens again - and that's quite a feat.<br/><br/>And Horner's music does A LOT for this movie. The creepy atmosphere when the marines enter the processing station is great, together with the adrenaline-pumping theme during Ripley's rescue.<br/><br/>Claustrophobia was one of the effects in the original Alien, but it's just as prominent here.

"Oryx","8","0","0","21 June 1999"," A great action film, but not the classic ""Alien"" is
","This is one of the best 'edge of your seat' sci-fi action films ever made, yet the original ""Alien"" still emerges as the more groundbreaking and daring film.<br/><br/>James Cameron was careful to give Ripley a plausible reason to return for another bout with the face-huggers et al (and it's too bad the same attention to plausibility wasn't provided in the next two films.)  By the end of ""Alien"", Ripley stood out as being the one character with the smarts we wish all horror movie characters possesssed.  In ""Aliens"" she becomes a kick-ass action goddess, which makes for an enjoyable romp yet turns the movie into something more cartoonish than the original.<br/><br/>The original had style and atmosphere in spades.  It wasn't afraid to take 45 minutes to really get going, and in that time we really got to know the characters.  There were layers of interaction going on between the Nostromo's crew that are lacking in ""Aliens"".  The marines are more simply drawn, but character isn't really what ""Aliens"" is about anyway.  The addition of a prominent child character, normally the death knell to any good horror movie, is handled surprisingly well in ""Aliens"", and her relationship with Ripley is genuinely touching.<br/><br/>When Dallas, Parker, or Lambert died in the original, there was a visceral impact.  Most of the characters in ""Aliens"" are far more expendable, and their deaths don't really have the same 'oomph', not only because they aren't as well-defined, but because the movie is so busy hurtling on to the next whiz-bang action sequence.<br/><br/>While the first movie's timing was more predictable for the hard-core horror-movie fan, ""Aliens"" is more inventive in keeping us on our toes, and in that way surpasses the original.  However, we know Ripley is the heroine. In ""Alien"", we didn't know that, and so the tension was much greater because we didn't have a 'safe' character we could be fairly certain would live.<br/><br/>""Alien"" was the true innovator, both in style and substance, with it's organic look and feel.  ""Aliens"" smartly and effectively plays off of it. While not as atmospheric and layered, it's one heck of a ride for even the most jaded moviegoer."

She kills a few aliens and then frees the girl.  As Ripley's about to leave she notices she's right next to the alien nursery and that a giant queen alien is suspended from the ceiling.  Meanwhile the damaged nuclear reactor is to explode in a few minutes and destroy everything in miles.

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","8","0","0","9 June 2003"," Interesting sequel, can't touch the original though
","James Cameron directs this sequel to one of the greatest science fiction films of our time: Alien. It turns out that Ripley has been floating around in Space for 57 years and when she lands aboard a space craft, she discovers that the setting of the original Alien film has been turned into a colony. When they lose contact with the colony, she's called in to go with a group of Marines to find out what's going on and to terminate the alien once and for all. There happens to be several accidents and Ripley and the Marines are stuck on the colony along with Newt, a young girl who the Marines nearly killed. As Ripley, Sigourney Weaver plays the part with a much heavier and brooding tone, and she even was nominated for an Oscar. It was a relatively new concept for the woman to be the leading action hero of a movie at the time, but she plays her part very well. The only really other note- worty cast member is Newt, who portrays emotions very well. Unfortunately, the script just falls flat. There is lot room for plot and it is wasted away with sequence after sequence of blasting away aliens. While Alien succesfully built things up, Aliens just decides to forget it all and blast everything. While the special effects are sharp, they don't feel quite as realistic as Alien, which had a much smaller budget. James Cameron directs shortly after making the cult Science- fiction film The Terminator, and he directs with a sort of chidlish ignorance. There are no powerful shots or wildly imaginitive attention to small details, and he just focuses on the action. However, he manages to at least keep focus on that, which ends up deserving some credit. However, even with these flaws Aliens still manages to be a somewhat good movie. The sheer velocity of Weaver's performance, and the finally crafted action sequences make more then up for the flat script and Cameron's direction adds in it a bit too. It's definitely not deserving of it's high status on the IMDb top 250, and should not even be on there nor compared to the original Alien. 8/10"

This film isn't much more than an arcade game for teenagers. Also, Paul Reiser (Mad About You) does absolutely nothing to improve this movie.

"CDallas","Null","0","0","7 May 1999"," It's more than a decade old, but that doesn't mean it's too late for a review.
","Aliens is the second chapter of a saga that will eventually consist of five. Right now, this series consists of four chapters, and will eventually have a fifth added to it.  Aliens is the most important and best made chapter of this terrifying legacy.  Master film-maker James Cameron was asked to step behind the camera and the keyboard to write and direct the impossible:  A sequel to the most terrifying movie of all time.  Most thought that this could not be accomplished and that this sequel would simply be a flop to fill a void in the list of movies released in 1986.  This was of course untrue, and Aliens managed to be good enough to inspire two more sequels. (and possibly three if we're lucky)  By most, Alien and Aliens are the best of the series, some saying Alien to be the best, some saying Aliens to be the best.  This series has been said to consist of two flawless films and two horrid films.  What's wrong with you!?  They're all good!  But Aliens must definitely be recognized as the best of this series.  Cameron is a master.  All of his movies are loved by me, and by most others.  This man's true talent is expressed in Aliens.  Just like in Titanic, Cameron's international appeal is shown through plot twists and character development.  Just like the sub-title says:  'This Time it's War,' it really is war.  You've got a troop of about thirty marines, an android, and a kick-ass bitch named Ripley to kick a billion Xenomorphs' asses.  On top of that is the mother/daughter relationship that Ripley establishes with the orphaned Newt, a couple scenes of flirting with Corporal Hicks, and the attempt to trust a species (android) that once s****ed her over and nearly killed her.  As well as someone else who s****s you over 2/3rds through the film.  Then there's a huge surprise at the end of the film that takes up most of the screen if you know what I mean, and a  load of action, horror, suspense, drama...  bla bla bla.  This film basically has it all in my opinion, so remember that!  And to sum it up, let me say a few words for the overall series:  This is a saga that doesn't have a poor episode (although Alien 3 comes close) and has a different feel per film that can still all be appreciated by the same person.  Aliens is the best film of them all, but not the one to start on.  See these films in chronological order.  If you haven't yet seen them, let me just say that you're in for a hell of a treat."

","""Aliens"" is the first sequel to 1979's ""Alien"". As the movie begins, Ellen Ripley's escape shuttle is picked up by a salvage crew 57 years after she encountered the alien and blew the Nostromo to smithereens. During those years she was away, a colony was set up on LV-426, the aliens' planet, but transmissions from them suddenly stopped. Ripley decided to end her nightmares and accompany a group of Marines to the planet as an advisor just in case any aliens might show up, and they do indeed. An all out war begins as the marines try their hardest to shoot up hundreds of aliens that infested the colony, while Ripley becomes a mother to the only survivor from the colony, a little girl name Newt. Aliens is definitely a very good action movie, but all of the suspense from the original film is gone. Most of it has been replaced by machine gun fire and explosions. The acting in this is top notch. The connection between Ripley and Newt (Carrie Henn) is unforgettable. The marines are also very well drawn out, my favorite being Hicks. He kept his cool through most of the bad situations that were encountered. Aliens is a very good sequel which continues the storyline as the viewer finds even more information about the aliens and WHO exactly laid all of those eggs.

Despite being enjoyably violent and quite tense in parts, it's the humor of the film that will stick with me. Check out Bill Paxton's hilariously dorky Private Hudson - ""Hey sir, you'll get lip cancer smoking those"". Apart from the humor, the film boasts some great performances, most notably Sigourney Weaver as Lieutenant Ripley and Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop (Don't miss that knife trick he does). More than 11 years before he won the Oscar for Titanic, James Cameron really proved his directorial talent with this.

Of course, the effects and creatures are nothing less than outstanding, but one of the best things about the film are the marines who go to battle with the aliens. Each soldier is extremely well written and the scenes aboard the Sulako, where we are introduced to the various characters, are fun to watch. When the action begins, it never lets up, right until the very end. My only complaint is that nothing this good has appeared in cinemas since."

","Some films are just meant for the big screen and nothing else. ALIENS is one of these few treasures. I am a little tired of all this James Cameron bashing that has been going on since his Oscar cleanup and announcing his title of ""King of the world."" If I staked any kind of pursuit on something I believed in that badly, and won when everyone else said I would fail, I would be laughing all the way to the bank too. You see that creativity and gift for entertainment come alive in ALIENS. Cameron has an uncanny gift for making his films run for a considerable timeframe, and makes them thoroughly captivating and riveting throughout their duration, never stopping for a breath. Titanic is like that, and so is Aliens. Aliens, in its last hour, is non-stop action and suspense, using techno-visuals to a vast extent and more energy than it knows what to do with it. Sigourney Weaver is great as Ripley, a heroine that doesn't take any crap from anyone, and does everything a man can do, only better. She also has a heart, which is evident in her perserverance in saving Newt (Carrie Henn). Paul Reiser is devious and slimy as Burke, far from his character on ""Mad About You."" Bill Paxton is also a standout. If you have any brains at all, do not eat too heavily before seeing this film. You'll definitely not be able to hold it in. Rating: Three stars and a half."

Sigourney Weaver still has the girl power performance of Ripley,the survivor from the first Alien movie goes back to where the terror begins and brings the marines to begin the war. There are good moments in the movie where she begin a some kind of mom-and-daughter relationship with a brave little girl named Newt,they make a good mother and daughter! that's why I loved this movie and I like the grand finale of Ripley confronts the Alien Queen with her power loader,which is one of my favorite lines from the movie,""GET AWAY FROM HER YOU B-----!""

The first movie was high suspense more like a horror story, this one is akin to a war movie but on the same theme.<br/><br/>That aside, ""Aliens"" has some qualities that set it above most other action movies.  In the short time span of a movie each character comes across as an individual (except for the aliens) and we get to know them.  The child actress who played Newt was also perfect for the part and had a very strong and fitting relationship with Sigourney Weaver's character.<br/><br/>It's a shame this movie has been followed by two successively worse sequels, not only does ""Aliens"" stand out because it's so good, but because it's also plausible to the mind.  The weapons, equipment, and technology seem like later developments of what we have today.

","Vastly more entertaining and exciting than the original, Aliens takes the central character of Ellen Ripley and brings her back to a colonized planet with an alien presence amidst doubts by crew going with her of her sanity. All that changes of course once arrived on the planet and having met the alien presence.  Director James Cameron does everything right in this film. The acting is very good, with Weaver giving a compelling performance filled with depth.  Lance Henriksen does an equally impressive job as a robot of sorts.  Paul Reiser plays a low-life scum with amazing conviction.  The rest of the cast works very well.  Bill Paxton plays an annoying marine-type fighter cracking under stress. I was annoyed with him in short time...to put it shortly.  Cameron steps the pace of this film up ten times what it was in Ridley Scott's ground-breaking original.  There is no lack of suspense.  The alien(s) is/are impressive as our the climatic scenes in the end of the film.  Like the first film, Aliens has a message about science versus life, corporate greed, military goals, and much more.  The band of gung-ho marines revel in their jobs of fighting prior to reaching the planet, yet once they land change their minds quickly, an interesting footnote to the reality of violence for those that believe they are indestructable.

","You would think that outdoing Alien is an almost impossible task.  James Cameron did it with Aliens.  Instead of copying the first one note for note, like many sequels do, Cameron upped the ante.  There are more characters, more aliens and more heart stopping thrills than you can shake a stick at. Where the film allows you to breathe, it continues to ratchet up the tension.  When the film explodes into action, it is orgasmic.  The release of the tension propels the action forward and we want Ripley, Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, et al to escape from these hideous beasts that seem to come out of every nook and cranny in this hellacious planet.  Cameron outdoes the climax of Alien by first giving us a glimpse at the queen, and then giving us one hell of a battle between Ripley and the creature that has haunted her for 56 years.

","I can only use a word to descrive this movie: AWESOME. One of Cameron's first movies (after a Piranha one and of course, Terminator), after he got really famous with T2 and Titanic, that I think it is his best one; it mixes sci-fi, thriller, horror and action. Being an Alien fan and a Cameron one, this is simply the best. Ridley Scott's movie, pretty good too, was maybe more calmed and scary, and Aliens is action-packed, terrifying and terrific! For if one alien wasnt enough, you get hundreds of them, hunting and chasing a bunch of poor marines that come to aliens' planet to rescue any people's lifes, but of course, the aliens have cocooned and eliminated all the peeps. So the marines find themselves trapped in a ruined colony full of predators (SPOILER****all marines but one die****), and their spaceship gets destroyed and they get attacked by the aliens and everything goes bad. The special effects are pretty good, still being from year 86, and the aliens are very cool, the film editing is great, the sound perfect. When you get all this in an scene, it gets great (see the battle scene aka ripley's rescue for example), creating horrible and thrilling atmospheres. Thought it is not very gory, it contains lots of frights and scary moments. James Horner's score is awesome too, and the cinematography is fantastic.<br/><br/>Talking about cast, we find some of James Cameron's most usual actors, such as Michael Biehn (the hero of Terminator), Lance Hersinken (Terminator too), Bill Paxton (again Terminator, plus True Lies and Titanic), jeanette Goldstein (T2), and of course, Sigourney Weaver (Alien series). The cast gets perfectly and the characters remain in the spectators' mind (who doesnt remember brave private Hudson p***ed in his pants?) Overally, this is one of sci-fi's masterworks, among with Star Wars, and for me, its the best Jim Cameron's work. The sequels, Alien 3 and Resurection are a piece of s*** compared with this movie, and surprisingly, Aliens is better or good as the first movie, Alien. 9.5/10"

Yes Cameron uses many of the invidious topos from the original, but they are desparate enough in approach to make the link between the two almost circumstantial.  Where ""Alien"" was primarily a psychological horror film (complete with underlying mysogamy and rape symbolism), ""Aliens"" is an action-packed, in your face, frenzy.  This inverse structure was very prescient on Cameron's part.  He took a good tale of terror, a vile, redoubtable villain and really shook up the mix.  And by adding more creatures he increases the horror expotentially.<br/><br/>He did keep one aspect of the precursor in tact, as well he should have: Changes in technology are present with futuristic equipment, but the characters stay very human (the Marines talk like Marines, corporate greed subverts survival, etc).  Also there is some clever dialogue.  My two favorites: Newt ominously stating ""They mostly come out at night...mostly"" and Bill Paxton (perfect in his comic relief assignment) telling Paul Reiser, ""Maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events but we just got out asses kicked""."

This is obviously everyones favorite in the Alien Franchise, but after viewing all 4 i have to say that i think this is really the odd man out. I dont know really how to say this but it seems that all of the films have very almost artistic vibes, but this film. Aliens just feels like it was made for the masses, no different from any of Cameron's other films i suppose, but, well, let's take a look. We have Alien. We have a simple concept, and a limited budget, but we have an excellent director, one who is known for his incredible attention to detail. We have True art on film in the form of Geiger's Alien, hive and planet. We have space suits designed by Moebius that look like something from the Air Tight Garage. We have strong characters, a good script, and air of mystery to everything. In fact this is what Alien is all about to me, this air of mystique. Part 3 and Ressurection continue this art by throwing in beautiful lighting, tons of sepia tones, blury detail, interesting and bizarre characters, and best of all, a continuation of high comic Heavy Metal Magazine themic styling by two of movies greatest directors David Fincher and Jeanne-Pierre Juenet. Part 2 really could have worked just as well with any ol group of crazy mean outter space monsters though. It's ok for a simple action film but doesnt really hold well on its own in the artistic department. I'm probably being too tough on this film. It isnt all that bad, but still when you line up to all the other films, you can see that this one just doesnt belong. It should have been made into a stand alone film so I could go on loving all the color in the other films without hearing folks gripe about the sequals, but then of course there would have been no other sequals.

There's Ripley of course, soft spoken Hicks, vulgar Hudson and our lesbian powergirl Vasquez. And there's the Aliens.

"Draculas_guest","Null","0","0","22 October 2001"," Great great film, but one teensy thing.....
",".....It just doesn't have the same atmosphere that Alien had. Those early scenes where Ripley is in the hospital, and on the ship headed for the alien planet just dont have the same feel, everything is too cosy, too well lit. Also, the alien planet, well, just doesnt look so alien with those Human colonists there. It reminds me more of the future earth scenes in 'The Terminator'. Perhaps the first Alien film was sluggish for some people but it had a really rich atmosphere which hasn't been replicated in this film, though perhaps thats a good thing as it allows this sequel to stand seperate.<br/><br/>The film really delivers in the second half when they have been stranded on the planet and have to hold off the hordes of aliens attacking them.  There is some great tension and the special effects have aged alot better than the first film and makes a perfect companion to Ridley scotts sci-fi horror opus. Bishop was thankfully a completely different type of robot compared to Ash, and it was also nice to see Michael Biehn's character survive to the end, the rest of those commandos were just irritating. All round good fun and good sequel"

","This is truly James Cameron´s greatest moment, especially in his longer ""director´s cut"" version. Probably the most beautiful action film of all time and with Sigourney as the queen of sci-fi hardnecks. The whole serie (at least the first 3 parts) contains more underlying themes and psychological comments than any other action opus and reaches its peak right here, so good that you even fully accept the little girl running around. All the horrifying waiting in the Alien serie spreads through this part like a decieving calmness, a mood that Cameron repeated 3 years later in The Abyss (director´s cut of course)another great movie but at the same time the complete opposit to Aliens in an idealogical sense. A major credit must also go to the creator of history´s most stunning alien race, the strange artist Giger. Jurrasic Park is a Disney film compared to this. You really want there to be creatures looking like this out there in space but you surely don´t want them to act this way! A plus also for seeing Paul ""Mad about you"" Reiser being slayed and deserving it. Hard and beautiful."

","Aliens is one of those very rare sequels that are viewed as better than the original by most people. It dares to do stuff that the crew of the original wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. This is what makes it stand out.<br/><br/>Ripley wakes up 57 years after her first encounter with the Alien. She learns that the planet visited in the original movie has been colonised during her slumber. Despite all her fears of the Alien, an unexplained yet understood inner motivation makes her return to the planet. Naturally under the protection of some bad-ass marines.<br/><br/>The cast of this movie is very strong and you can see why James Cameron casts many of these actors over and over again in his movies. Sigourney Weaver manages to show fear and aggression towards the Aliens. Michael Biehn does a good job portraying a character that keeps his cool, but also stays alert and focused. Bill Paxton is completely unforgettable as the cocky bad-ass turned panicky coward, Private Hudson. I won't go into detail with the rest of the cast, but they all give stellar performances.<br/><br/>The special effects of this movie are absolutely amazing. The film is 15 years old and manages to outshine most of the CGI-dependant movies of recent years. James Cameron's theory of motion over appearance works brilliantly. To make the Alien in the first film less human-like, they mostly concealed the beast in darkness, there were still one or two scenes where the Alien's presence was ruined with human motion. In the sequel, Cameron hired the talents of stuntmen and tried all sorts of tricks, the Aliens move so brilliantly that you have to suspend belief that there are actually humans inside. The film is also backed up with fantastic sets and makeup effects from industry expert, Stan Winston.<br/><br/>From start to finish, James Horner's soundtrack adds a new dimension of suspense and wonder. It was also great for fans of the original to hear tidbits of Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack mixed in.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fantastic film and a true classic. This movie deserves every ounce of hype it gets, it's tense, it's exciting, it delivers! Rating: 9/10."

","The first ""alien"" movie was my first rated ""R"" movie when i was about 10 or so.  I loved it and was scared too.  I didnt watch the sequel until recently (i'm 17 now) and i enjoyed as well.  I didnt find it to be as scary or suspenseful as the first but the effects and acting was an improvement. The cast was incredible.  Sigourney Weaver returns as the macho alien killer along with Michael Bien and Bill Paxton. I loved Bill Paxton's character. Even though he got annoying, he added some comic relief at critical times. The actor who played Bishop was great too.  What i loved about this movie most was the entertainment aspect of it.  The action was nonstop and the guns were impressive.  I agree with another user that they should have made the aliens stronger and needed more bullets to die.  The queen alien was very impressive.  I would encourage any sci-fi lovers to see this movie. If your looking for something scary i would suggest you look elsewhere.  If you want to be entertained, this is your movie.  8/10"

","Wow, this was an awesome sequel! It's the Third best sequel ever made (the other two being the godfather 2 and the color of money). The special effects have out-done themselves in this movie (there are  different types of aliens in this one).<br/><br/>I don't think that the the two sequels can be compared, because they are totally different. This one offered loads of action, while 'Alien' gave us loads of suspense. There are more interesting weapons and gadgets, but I kind of wish the alien drones were a little tougher, like in the first one.<br/><br/>Ah yes, and lets not forget Sigourney Weaver, the *BEST* female action star ever. She puts a whole meaning to the word 'action star'. The best and most thrilling scene in this movie, or for that matter, in all Sci-Fi movies, was the show down between the Queen Alien and Ripley in the fork lift (which has been futilely imitated many times). This was the best fight in Sci-Fi movies ever. This fight also spawned a very memorable catch phrase, seen above<br/><br/>
So in closing, this is not really a sequel to 'Alien' because the two movies are nothing alike, they both have great qualities, but in incomparable ways. Watch it Sci-Fi fans, ya won't be disappointed! 9/10"

Only downfall is that after you have seen Alien 3, this one seems pointless to watch as far as carring at all about the characters.

"deapod","Null","0","0","6 July 2001"," The best of the ALIEN films
","This is the best of the four ALIEN movies.  What most people don't seem to realize is that it borrows liberally from Robert Heinlein's classic SF novel STARSHIP TROOPERS (the book, not the much later film, but that's another story).  The idea of the ""bug hunt,"" the tunnels of eggs, the very inhumanity of the alien foe.  Actually, a lot of movies and books borrowed from that novel.  If only James Cameron had blown off TITANIC and done STARSHIP TROOPERS (and if they'd managed to create believable battle armor), and let Paul Verhoeven make a movie about some boat and a chunk of ice, I'd have been a lot happier.  But I digress.  ALIENS features Sigourney Weaver at her asskicking best, especially when she wields that rifle on the planet, and when she uses the loading suit to fight the Alien on the ship.  As for Paul Reiser, I only wish he showed a tenth of the cojones during that miserable angstfest known as MAD ABOUT YOU.  The whole cast was perfect, and whoever said that Hicks was Bill Paxton's best role is correct.  The SFX were and still are top notch, and I only wish that I had a DVD player so that I could see it digitally.  In my opinion, you can skip the other three ALIEN movies (especially ALIEN RESURRECTION, of which I watched about five minutes and turned it off), and just watch ALIENS, over and over again. One other little tidbit...When he was working on creating STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION, Gene Roddenberry watched a number of SF films, including ALIENS. He was impressed by the tough Vasquez so much, that he created the role of the ENTERPRISE'S Security Chief as a woman--LT Macha Hernandez.  Marina Sirtis originally read for this role, and Denise Crosby originally read for Counselor Deanna Troi.  However, Crosby was much more believable as the security officer, so the character was renamed Tasha Yar to capitalize on her blonde hair.  Sirtis was, of course, given the role of Counselor Troi."

"mentalcritic","9","0","0","21 May 2001"," Action and science fiction combined to make a punishing masterpiece
","I'm what you'd call a serious non-fan of James Cameron. As a matter of fact, I happen to think he is an egotistical blowhard whose claims in the area of storytelling are rarely backed up by his end product. Titanic and Terminator 2 are good examples of this. The former was not a patch on earlier films about what remains the worst maritime disaster on record (I think), such as A Night To Remember. The latter just doesn't cut it compared to the grittiness of the film it follows on from, which was a blatant example technophobia passed off as science fiction. So what is it about Aliens that makes me watch it time and time again in spite of having been directed by one of my least favourites?<br/><br/>In a word, it is the human characters that make this film what it is. Like Alien before it, Aliens is not so much a story about monsters attacking humans, but humans being done in by collective irresponsibility. The interaction between the humans is what makes these two films as compelling as they are, and the lack of it is what makes the two films that follow this sequel as disappointing as they were. Who can forget the banter between the colonial marines as compete to see who is the most macho?<br/><br/>The film does take its time to set up the situation, with a long narrative drive before any of the aliens are seen at all. This is in keeping with the original, and just as in that situation but the lengthy setup pays major dividends. Once the action gets started, it only ever stops long enough to set the focus of the remaining action, or to give the viewer time to catch their breath.<br/><br/>There are some glaring technical faults in this film, which makes Cameron's claims about his attention to technical accuracy all the more amusing. For example, when asked what the M41A pulse rifle fires, Lieutennant Gorman says ""ten millimeter explosive-tip caseless"". Yet, in the retreat from the makeshift base later in the film, shell casings can be clearly seen coming out of Vasquez's pulse rifle. The idea that a squad of marines, even the most obedient kind, would contemplate entering a nest full of such vicious creatures armed only with flame throwers is too ridiculous to even contemplate. The idea that they would handle a combat situation with creatures that have acid for blood in such a clumsy manner is even more ridiculous.<br/><br/>But in the end, what makes this film work is that it is more of a human drama than a science fiction film. You could almost call the film Humans, as a matter of fact. The relationship between Newt and Ripley slows the pace a lot, but the cross-fire between the marines more than makes up for this. After a while, one really gets the feeling that the marines are more ready to go to war with each other than the aliens. Then again, if you had to put up with guys like Gorman, Hudson, or Burke for such extended periods of time, you'd probably want to kill everyone in the room, too.<br/><br/>All in all, Aliens is a nine out of ten film as far as I'm concerned. The only part where it loses a point is the slow, awkward moments with Newt's character being developed. Aside from these moments that really could have been left on the cutting room floor, the film rockets along at a pace which makes it difficult to think about the plot inconsistencies."
"timefreezer7","9","0","0","21 May 2001"," The best action/fantasy thriller EVER !!! ( some small spoilers )
","This movie was made in 1986 but noone has managed to top it ever since. Not only it is probably the best of its kind but it DEFINATELY surpassed the horrible , boring ""Alien"" ( I know I may get shot for that ) Ridley Scot 's film has a couple of CLASSIC moments (e.g. the facehugger on Kane 's face , the chestbursting , the death of Ash and the explosive finale ) but otherwise it is a BORING BORING BORING picture , slow and manytimes inbearable . Just think of it . If the story of Aliens was used for the first part and vice versa everyone would regard Alien as a mediocre sequel ( just like Alien 3 ) . Think of it . Alien was definately a classic because it simply happened to be the first in the row . But classic does not necessarily mean good . This  does not mean that the James Cameron version has not its flaws. Basically the script takes the idea and reproduces it ( more aliens , more weapons etc ) There are many similarities as well in the basic plot ( a double -faced traitor , an explosive finale , the alien comes on board , the alien is neutralised in precisely the same way )I would dare to say at all cost that it is  simply a rehash (or a remake why not ? )  . So what makes Aliens so special ?<br/><br/>First of all the direction . I believe this is definately Cameron 's best job to date . The SFX are something beyond excellent they are convincing . You really BELIEVE that these creatures exist . Especially in the final breathtaking scene ( I won 't reveal it here ) . All I can say is that you will find yourself HOOKED in the screen . I don 't think that there is a most convincing ""fake"" scene , not in an action film but a movie generally . Sigourney Weaver is an ever - reliable actress and she does her best here . Her Ripley is one of the most ""everyday"" courageful and brave people in cinematic history . I think 50 % of the film 's success is due to her perfomance . She was BORN to play Ripley !!!<br/><br/>Some story elements: Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep when she is rescued by ""blind luck"" . The company people want to know what happened and why Nostromo was destroyed . This is one of the most ""entertaining"" (in a very peculiar way) sequences in film history (you don't know whether to laugh or cry) because she tells the same story again and again but nobody believes her !!! Ripley is still haunted by bad dreams with the Alien . She decides to escort the Aliens ' destruction mission as an advisor since she has advanced knowledge on the subject . With a group of Marines they land on a space colony only to find out that the habitants are killed by those dreadful monsters . The Aliens have reproduced themselves by infesting the planet with eggs , facehuggers and babies . The advanced weaponry unfotunately cannot save them . After a few typical combat scenes the force is dwelled by half and there is only one way to save themselves .<br/><br/>There are solid and ( I would say quite good ) perfomances from all the other actors . Paul Reiser (Burk) , Michael Biehn (Hicks) , Bill Paxton (Hudson) , Carrie Hehn (Newt) and Lance Henricsen(Bishop) . There are some unforgettable lines which make the rollercoaster even better "" Stay away from me Bishop "" , "" So why don't you put HER in charge ? "" , "" I don 't know which species is worse . At least you don 't see them fucking over a percentage "" , "" Stay away from my ship you BITCH ""etc.<br/><br/>Now the cons : 1)some of you may find the dark cinematography irritating and hard to follow 2) Despite the suspence , some action scenes are quite predictable ( the first combat with the aliens , the facehugger attacks Ripley scene , the trapped in the lab waiting for the alien assault scene etc ) . 3) The script does not avoid some plot holes which seem to torture almost every sci-fi adventure : why don 't they blow up the planet after the first deaths ( especially since the leader dies ), how Bishop escaped the Aliens through the conductors ( maybe because he doesn 't have body temperature ? ) , why don 't they think of the escape vessel immediately since most are dead etc ,etc . 4) It is quite predictable who lives in the end .<br/><br/>Despite the defects the story is so beautifully told and the finale is so breathtaking and convincing that you will find yourself sucked by the illusion of cinema .  See it after midnight and preferably alone. You will enjoy it more . ALIENS ROCKS !!!<br/><br/>9/10"

After every avenue of diplomacy has been navigated, this movie just ends up becoming one giant butt-kicking fest; aliens vs. marines.  Those marines suits were covered in Wicker Armor, courtesy of Pier One imports, so the armor didn't work too well, but it was just decorative.  Maybe in the future we humans should rotate to the other side of the galaxy, where the mutant aliens don't live.  A prehistoric mutant hellbeast beats a human armed with a machine gun any day of the week. This was some of Sigourney's best acting right here, and Paul Reiser was good as the corporate raider, who goes along for the Company.  My only complaint was that the models in this movie were much much cheesier than the sets I've seen in a lot of other sci-fi movies.

Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton also deliver noteworthy performances. Cameron does a fine job as director. His direction of the battle scenes is fantastic. Ray Lovejoy's fast paced editing is exceptional. Through his editing you get the sense that there are dozens upon dozens of aliens inhabiting the planet of LV-426 when in fact only six aliens are ever seen in one shot. Stan Winston's creature effects for the aliens are first rate, as are the wonderful sets. James Horner's riveting musical score is very effective.

","Aliens is James Cameron´s best picture in his career. Also Sigourney Weaver´s best in her career and everybody else´s, behind & in front of the camera.I am talking about the greatest adrenalin kick of them all. This is a Sci-fi movie with a master director and very good actors. The screenplay is fantastic and has most of elements from Alien. It means you can think back and remember the same atmosphere & places, witch is good and important for a sequel. But it still is original in a special way. Alien is a good movie, but now after more than 20 years if i watching it, i´m going to sleep in the middle of the film. But if i watch Aliens, i even can´t sleep. Not because of the horor but because of the adrenalin kick. I have seen Aliens more than 25 times & even analyzed it. It´s great to find new things every time. The score from James Horner is a ear candy & one of the best of all time. In Aliens you can find the greatest action female character in movie history. You can also find the coolest supporting actor in Bill Paxton. So i rank this as Cameron´s best art work before T2 & Titanic. I was so sad to see Alien3 & 4 because they are far from good. They have already ruined the castle who Scott & Cameron build up. Please do not make Alien5 to ruins it more. I want to say to all of you who thinking that Alien movies are silly: you don´t even need to see all parts, just see THE best part witch is called Aliens (1986)! I would like to thank & celebrate James Cameron because he is such a creative Writer/Director/Producer, and a great inspiration for me and many other people in the world.

"Hair Thief","9","0","0","12 April 2001"," Sequels - they can work
","When I first saw Aliens back in the late eighties, it was considered the hip and cool film to see. I really didn't like to just go with the crowd so the main point I picked out was that it was almost always dark and so you couldn't see what was going on, hence I thought it wasn't that good. I am now big enough to admit that I was wrong.<br/><br/>As for the argument ""is it as good as original?"", my answer is yes. Mainly for the fact that it succeeds on its own merits, very rare for any sequel. The 2 films are very different in my opinion, different genres under the general umbrella of sci-fi. The first ""alien"", was a tense, scary atmospheric film. It had a group of civilians that come up against a terrifyingly dangerous opponent and how they fight for their lives. Now for a sequel, it would be stupid to do the same thing, there had to be something new. Cameron decides to take things up a notch, instead of the atmospheric ""where is it? I'm terrified"", we have a band of good guys that could be a match for the alien, professional army types. I agree that eventually they are in a similar situation to the characters from the original but there is still a preference for action than suspense. It is then left to the viewer if they would rather see a suspense film or an action film, both are of high quality. Personally I prefer action films (probably because the original is a little too suspensfull for me, I find myself jumping out of my seat every 2 minutes). I just hope that films like Matrix 2, Jurassic Park 3, MIB 2 and The Mummy Returns all take note and have the same mix of the spirit of the original but still have something new to see.<br/><br/>Aliens has a superb plot, i love the idea of the marines thinking they can kill anything, meeting their match and then running for cover. Paul Reiser's character is maybe a little bit too evil *spoiler* surely he wouldn't want to risk being attacked by the aliens on the trip home when he intended to have ripley impregnated, he's a weasel, he'd just want to get out of there alive and forget about the others *end spoiler*<br/><br/>All in all, I do like this film and its name has been tarnished by the far lesser sequels that follow it (even though the talented fincher directed alien3).<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

Lets face it, if mankind can install a huge nuclear plant that re-creates atmosphere on a remote planet, they must have come up with a newer model assualt rifle by then.<br/><br/>However, its still a great movie as long as you adapt to the fact that its basically an American war movie where the other side isnt the Germans or the Russians, but the ALIENS.<br/><br/>Few cliches: The young inexperienced officer screws up the operation, but Ripley and the vetran corporal save the day.  Ripley challenging the queen to hand to hand combat, the corporate executive who no morals at all and will do anything for money and power (cardboard cut-outs?) etc<br/><br/>Some thought still went into detail though which saves the movie for me. The Marines' transport and attack vehicles are believeable.  My favourite scene is the combat ""drop"" from the orbiting transport ship.  The efficient woman pilot, terrified young officer and sleeping veteran etc really feels right, plus the logic works that would be a beliveable way for a combat unit to get down from an orbiting ship to the planet surface.<br/><br/>A good movie, especially for a sequel, but with a little more imagination it could have been a GREAT movie."

","I bought a copy of this on DVD recently as I had wanted to see it for some time and I thought that this was the best way to. My purchase was not a waste of money. Some people say sequels are nowhere near as good as the original and they are right. The Alien saga does not fit in this category although I have yet to see Alien 3 and I have seen the 4th but not all of it and I thought that was okay. Aliens is one of the best sequels I have ever seen. It may be longer than the first ( my version is the Special Edition which lasts 148 minutes ) but it is just as good if not better. Ripley wakes up after 57 years of hypersleep and finds that the planet where she found the alien has now been colonised. But they have lost contact with the colonists and Ripley goes along with a bunch of marines to see what has happened. All they find is a little girl and a whole load of Aliens! While the first had only one alien and was rarely seen in full, this one is an alien overload! No matter how many bullets are used, they just keep on coming. And later, we are introduced to the Alien Queen who has a fight with a power-suited Ripley at the climax. This film is now 15 years old but like the first it has not dated. The Alien effects are so cool especially the Queen. Just goes to show that you don't always need CGI effects! Although this is more of an action film, there is quite a bit of gore and there are also some tense moments. The acting is on par with the first and James Cameron does a great job in continuing the saga. And of course there is the great score by James Horner. Overall, a classic sequel to a classic film."
"r_topher","Null","0","0","17 February 2001"," Why this was such a hit, and why 3 and 4 weren't.
","Alien established Ripley as a character everyone could admire and relate to. A human being who, though terrified, fought back.  To save her friends, to save her ship and to just survive. Aliens took it one step further, Ripley had to go back and confront the fears that paralyzed her after surviving them.  Everyone wishes they could become as strong after surviving the terrible things life can throw at you. Ripley embodied this and people related to it.  It's what made the movie such a big hit.  You don't just root for her to win, you ADMIRE her.  You CARE about her.  You FEEL her pain. She FOUGHT to save Newt, the marines and herself.  You felt as if you were there fighting along side her, and most people like to think they would do the same thing if in the same situation. These things along with great direction, story/plot, special effects and pacing made for an exciting movie experience, and set up parts 3 and 4 to fail.  In Alien 3, Ripley just seem to give up.  If she didn't care why should we?  In Resurrection (part 4) she was portrayed as an engineered automaton, and again she didn't really seem to care, so neither did we. You can't blame Sigourney, the woman can ACT!  And don't blame David Fincher for the disappointment of Alien 3, the man has talent that 20th Century Fox just didn't have faith in. I won't even start with Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>So when you do like I do and watch Aliens for about the 50th or 60th time, think about why you like Ripley so much.  You'll realize just how strong, determined and vulnerable her character really is.  And we LIKED her that way!!!"

"iskra-3","Null","0","0","2 January 2001"," James Cameron's best action film
","James Cameron had become famous for his box-office smash action films like ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" and ""True Lies,"" but I regard ""Aliens"" as his best. The story involves Ellen Ripley, the only survivor of the cargo ship Nostromo's battle with the vicious ""alien"", returning to Earth. There, she is asked to join up with a crew of ultra high-tech marines to investigate the dissapearance of colonists on planet LV-426. She joins up and the adventure begins.<br/><br/>The characters of ""Aliens"" are surprisingly multi-demensional. Ripley is just supposed to be an observer, while the rough marines are supposed to be in charge. However, she quickly becomes the leader when her emotional maturity under pressure becomes a greater quality than being good with a gun. And even when she does become a female Rambo, it is not because she is tough. Its because something of great value has been taken from her (the young girl Newt, the only surviving colonist) and it is worth risking her life to get it back. The other supporting players are less interesting, but all figure in to the plot with some relevance. Paul Reiser is notable as the double-crossing Burke (shades of Cameron's script for ""Rambo: First Blood Part II"" show up here).<br/><br/>The action is relentless and extremly exciting, without being ""joyous"". The atmosphere that Cameron creates is so dark, uncomfortable, and scary, that Ripley and the colonists fighting for their lives is also hellish. The director never lets you feel safe, and does a great job increasing the impending doom as the movie continues. Even on the mothership, when Ripley is recounting her tale of the alien to skeptical marines, you can feel that these soldiers have absolutley no idea of what there coming up against.<br/><br/>With an above-average action script, good performances, and excellent direction and cinematography, ""Aliens"" comes out a winner above Cameron's other solid work<br/><br/>The original ""Alien"" offers a better script and better performances. But ""Aliens"" is a very decent sequel."

","Despite the unparalleled success of Titanic, this is the movie that made Jim Cameron and is still arguably his best effort.  Released in 1986, two years after his groundbreaking Terminator, Aliens is a celebration of American military might (the movie was made after six years of unprecedented defense spending under President Reagan) and mastery over nature.  Although it depends heavily on the original Alien (1979) in art direction and style (and, of course, subject matter), it stands on its own as an equally compelling and suspenseful sci-fi horror movie.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver excells at fleshing out the Ripley character into a true screen icon--she's the female Rambo.  All secondary characters (Carrie Henn (Newt), Bill Paxton, Lance Henrickson, even Paul Reiser) are well acted and memorable.  The pacing is quick, gritty, and if it doesn't get your heart racing you are indeed jaded!<br/><br/>A great fun ride, one of the grand blockbuster films of the 1980s.

","This is another rare case in which a sequel isn't worse or better than the original.  Comparing the two, ""Alien"" had certain qualities that ""Aliens"" was lacking, but ""Aliens"", of course, had much more action and plenty of satisfying eye-candy (especially the ending!).  ""Alien"" was almost unbearably suspenseful, and left me as frightened as Ripley in the end, but ""Aliens"" left me disappointed that it was over and begging for more. Whether or not that's a good thing, I still have yet to decide.  It seems that every time I watch it, it gets better.  Seeing it on the big screen would have really made a difference.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that the alien effects in this film really stole the show. Believe me, you will not be disappointed with them.  Most of them look as real as the most top-notch computer animation of today, maybe even more real.  How this was accomplished still amazes me.  Everything else seemed outdated, but passable just the same.<br/><br/>Following Ridley Scott's example, director James Cameron, whom will always remain one of my favourite directors, didn't spend too much time revealing the form of the aliens.  This makes the attacks against the marines ten times more frightening.  When you did see an alien, you were never sure of which part you saw, because they either moved too fast or the camera angle changed too quickly.  Cameron only showed what he wanted you to see, and the more he showed of the aliens, the more your heart begins to pound.  This all adds up to the gripping ending: Ripley's confrontation with the alien queen.<br/><br/>Another element Cameron took up from Scott was excellent character development, especially on Sigourney Weaver's behalf.  Her display of both fear, anger and heroism were especially touching, and the use of Newt, a little girl and the last survivor of the infested colony, to create a mother-daughter relationship greatly increased the emotional aspect of the film, which normally doesn't work in action/sci-fi.<br/><br/>Bill Paxton, in a role somewhat out of place, works particularly well as Hudson.  His display of confidence before landing on LV-426 quickly takes a pitfall after the first battle against the aliens, and refuses to go anywhere with a remote chance of being attacked again.  His feelings are so clear, we become just as traumatized as he is when he is forced to face them again.<br/><br/>Other characters, such as Burke and the marines, are noticeably well done as well.  Burke, who's got a hidden agenda of his own, can easily be felt as that typical person who you feel you can trust but in the end cares only for themselves.  The other marines, on the other hand, are detailed enough so you actually care for them when they die, even if they don't seem like nice people.<br/><br/>There are pros and cons to the special edition; I never found digitally remastered sound to make much of a difference, and I can see why some of the scenes were chosen to be cut from the original release.  Mostly, the scenes of the colony before the disaster were not particularly well done, and I suppose the film's sense of abandonment carried from the original would have worked better without them.  Of course, one scene I can't understand why it had been cut was with Burke telling Ripley that her daughter had died at age sixty-six, two years before she had been found.  Ripley explains that she had promised her that she'd be back for her eleventh birthday.  This was an especially emotional part of the film that explains why Ripley decides to accept responsibility of Newt so easily.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie cannot be watched only once.  If you do, you'll soon find yourself desperate to watch it again.  If you haven't seen it yet, buy it, don't rent it."
"tullymox","Null","0","0","31 October 2000"," The Special Edition vastly improves the story - SPOILERS
","Most ""Special Editions"" are designed to milk a few extra bucks out of a film by adding scenes that were usually excised for a good reason and enhancing the special effects (See Close Encounters - The Special Edition and any Lucasfilm stuff).  In the case of Aliens, though, Fox forced James Cameron to make cuts that drastically changed the motivation and development of characters, especially Ripley.  When I saw Aliens, one of the main criticisms I had was why Ripley was so obsessed about saving Newt. Here is a character whose sense of self-preservation is enormous, but she is willing to commit suicide to save a kid.  The special edition restores scenes that explain her actions.  After arriving on Earth, she asks to see her daughter and is devastated to learn that she died at age 67 (Ripley promised her she'd return before her 11th birthday).  Newt acts as a surrogate child, and Ripley needs to save her to make psychological amends with her daughter. Additional scenes build on the relationship between the two, and it's sad to see them removed from the original.  Fox decreed that the scenes made Ripley seem weak and too emotional; her character had to be consistently tough, according to the studio.  Sadly, the missing scenes could have earned Sigourney Weaver the Oscar for Best Actress, rather than just a nomination. The other scenes I don't understand being removed were the ones from the Sentry Gun subplot.  These are well-crafted action sequences that provide the viewer with the understanding of just how single-minded the hive Aliens are in their goal. One major criticism of the movie has been that the creatures in this movie don't act as craftily as in the original and instead act in a mindless ""KILL KILL KILL"" manner. For me, the video-game like onslaught of Aliens makes total sense, especially in view of the insect correlation.  One alien alone on a ship would act more cautiously, because there are no others like it yet.  Total self-preservation was the key. However, in a hive, the insects/aliens act very much like bees; the aliens' sole purpose is to protect the hive and Queen.  The sentry gun sequences only serve to enhance this aspect of the story.  There are scenes in the special edition that weren't absolutely necessary, but they are enjoyable nonetheless.  The sequences of Newt and the other colonists before the disaster were an interesting contrast to the feral Newt of the theatrical release.  If you haven't seen the special edition, I highly recommend it. <br/><br/>
One other note: Of the many criticisms I have of Alien3, my strongest objection was to the way it treated the characters from Aliens.  Killing Hicks, Newt and Bishop was a poor choice; watching the series in order completely diminishes the importance of the final 30 minutes of Aliens. Unfortunately, the series has become Sigourney Weaver's Alien saga, and the post-Aliens sequels are all pathetic (and poorly conceived)attempts to match Ripley up with the monsters.  As far as I'm concerned, Ripley should have disappeared after Aliens and a whole new spin placed on the series.  In an interview, Weaver scoffed at ideas like Aliens versus Predator as comic-book junk.  If she's ever read any of the comics, she'd have known that not all of these stories are bad and some are very creative.  I'm not saying that the Alien saga has to go in that direction, but it just shows that Weaver will do anything to keep the series firmly in Ripley's grasp.  What's next, the Ripley Ghola? Dune meets Aliens?  All I can say is that it's sad to see a series that had so much potential pigeonholed the way it's been."

Then we finally see the queen...holy cow! What a nasty creature! It's probably the most hideous monster in movie history. The scene with Sigourney Weaver going down the elevator and loading one gun after the other until we see the doors open and reveals Ripley and her one-woman arsenal is awesome. It made us realize that a woman with a well-written role can be a tough-as-nails action hero in a non-comic book fashion. Bill Paxton is hysterical in this film, and his final few minutes in the movie are classic. And when we see our few remaining heroes in a room lit by only by a red emergency light as Hudson anxiously reads from his little radar is one of the best scenes in all of sci-fi history. The intensity of this scene soon ends and right away the film kicks into high octane and never lets up. The film is relentlessly exciting from this point on, and the excitement continues even after a brief moment in which we think the movie is about to enter a sappy ending. And when we see the bay doors open and Ripley walk forward in the giant robot is the epitome of the word awesome...and then her first line from that point puts on the exclamation point. It's a shame that this movie was followed by the awful Alien 3 and the even worse Alien: Resurrection (one of the worst movies I've ever seen).

Ripley and the team then descend onto the planet and that is when the action begins. There are a lot of reasons why I would recommend this movie to anyone. It portrays the characters' personalities extremely well(Bill Paxton's character is an example) and it also creates enough tension to make you pee in your pants. The special effects were good for a movie made in the 1980s, and there is enough one liners and memorable quotes to keep you begging for more. Another reason why I like this movie is because it has none of those kissing scenes and mushy stuff. Every movie I have watched in the past 8 years had a kissing scene. The music was excellent, too. The dialogue, unlike most movies, is easily understood, and can keep the most prominent dialogue hater interested. Aliens is still my number 1 movie. And until now, nothing has come close to it."

","""Aliens"" is the coolest movie ever!!!!!! I like to watch the original trailer (featured in the special edition) first, then watch the original edition, then watch the special edition. That way I get the feel of seeing it in the theater, then seeing the special edition after. Tip Tipping (Crowe) and Trevor Steedman (Wierzbowski) could of gotten a little more screen time, though. Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, and Bill Paxton all gave believable performances. Al Mathews was hilarious! Paul Reiser was effective as a good-turned-bad villain. This film really introduced the genius of Mr. James Cameron and put him on the list of big-time directors. Stan Winston's creations were pure examples of professional craftsmanship and gave us the feeling that there may be a related life form out there."

","I saw the original ""Alien"" not too long ago, and I loved it. I thought the story was strong, the acting was excellent, and the scares were great. I kept hearing, though, that the sequel was almost superior to the original. Finally, I rented ""Aliens"" and checked it out. And I must say, I was impressed.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the only survivor of the Nostromo, the ship from the original film, has been found floating around in a space pod, in a deep sleep. The ship that finds her takes her in, and the crew helps her recuperate, hoping to  find out what happened. Soon, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) proposes she use her expertise on a mission to a desolate planet where a colony of humans has appeared to have been wiped out by aliens similar to those in the original. Ripley reluctantly agrees, and joins the crew on a mission to the planet, whose only survivor is Rebecca ""Newt"" Jordan (Carrie Henn), a little girl that the crew finds early in their arrivlal. What then unfolds is a nightmare that Ellen and the crew were never prepared for, as the aliens close in on them, and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>The movie keeps a great pace, despite a small stumble towards the middle that almost makes the movie sort of tedious in the desperate ""What the hell are we going to do?"" situation the surviving handful of crew members are put in. But the action is well-done, and there is amazing suspense, particularly in the scene where the two face-huggers attack Newt and Ripley in the bedroom, and the whole final ten of fifteen minutes of the movie. Some of the early killings get rid of characters you never even connect with, and the scenes are so wild, you don't even know who got killed. Those the audience does identify with are quite interesting, and most are likable, especially Ripley. The climax is absolutely wild, and is there much better a line than, ""Get away from her, you bitch!""? One of my favorite parts was in the end, when Ripley opens the hatch to release the queen alien, and it grabs her and tries to pull her down with it. And Ripley gives off this chilling scream that was so terrifying, I had to watch the scene a second time. The music is effective and at times, absolutely perfect. And the acting...such great acting. Sigourney Weaver deserved the Oscar. She was amazing, from start to finish, and I couldn't help but cheer for her the whole time. The way she gave Ripley real emotion and personification is rare in horror films today, as many heroines come off as just ""goody-goody"" or too tough. I really hope she shows up more in the horror genre. Carrie Henn was actually not very annoying, as most child actors are. She was a likable little girl. Paul Reiser was great, and like Bill Paxton, quite funny at times. Lance Henrikson, Michael Beihn, and Jenette Goldstein rounded out the stars of the movie, and each did quite well in their roles. The rest of the characters I sort of lost track of. <br/><br/>This is a great movie, and despite it getting a bit monotonous in the middle, it really is worth a look, and deserves the reputation it still has today."

","James Cameron's Aliens ranks as one of the all-time great science fiction movies.

There are, as could be expected, star turns all round from a very well balanced cast, William Hope (Lt. Gorman) especially. It's a shame he didn't get a chance to go onto better things. By today's standards, the cast would be considered star studded, featuring such stars emerging at the time as Paul Reiser, Bill Paxton and, of course, Sigourney Weaver, who was the only truly established actor at the time.<br/><br/>Cameron manages to capture the correct mood and feel of the film perfectly, and for those of you who have since read Alan Dean Foster's novel, it serves as a superb visual aid.<br/><br/>If, by some chance freak of nature, you haven't seen this film, then stop whatever you are doing, and find yourself a copy.

","What impresses me most about 20th Century Fox's ALIEN series is that the studio has strongly resisted the temptation to churn out mindless brain-dead sequels until the law of diminishing returns kicks in. All four films have, to date, provided refreshing variations on a theme in each case directed by visionary film-makers, even if the results have sometimes been a little flawed. Sigourney Weaver has wisely bolted her career to this series and has consistently offered us a dynamic and compelling portrayal of a woman facing her personal demons, illuminating each episode with a level of complexity unheard of in the genre. <br/><br/>Most fans of the series will not argue over my choice of James Cameron's first sequel as the stand-out offering, especially when presented in it's extended version. The no-nonsense direction, a tight well-developed screenplay and great production design (on what was quite a low budget for a film of this size at the time) makes this the ride of the century.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's clinical, cramped and claustrophobic original is also extremely impressive with some incredible production design and art direction. <br/><br/>That ALIEN 3 and ALIEN RESURRECTION lag behind is not a reflection of the films themselves rather than of the very the high standard set by the first two entries. If you can ignore such comparisons, they are not without interest and deserve re-appraisal. ALIEN 3 (directed but disowned by David Fincher) is a dark, moody, angst-ridden film with an almost mythic element completely ignored by it's original audience. The special version re-cut for DVD is worth looking at but the whole thing has the unmistakable smell of studio interference about it.<br/><br/>ALIEN RESURRECTION is a bit of a curate's egg. If you buy in to the grim humour, it's an interesting development of the first three films and Weaver is delicious, clearly having great fun playing a clone of herself.<br/><br/>However, ALIENS is the star of the quartet - if ever the words 'adrenaline' and 'rush' belong in the same sentence, it's here. This movie is like a theme park thrill and it leaves you breathless. Enjoy the ride."

"eibon09","Null","0","0","3 March 2000"," Worthy Sequel To Original
","Aliens(1986) is not only one of the best films of the 1980's, but also a terrific sequel(a rarity) to Ridley Scott's Alien(1979).  Its interesting to know that David Cronenberg rejected the offer to do this film for it was his feature film debut Shivers(1975) that played a major influence on the Alien series(He would instead direct a more personal film called Dead Ringers-1988).  Aliens(1986) comes on the heels of The Terminator(1984), James Cameron's breakthrough motion picture.  It has exciting scenes of action and chilling scenes of horror.  This is my favorite of the Alien series because it has characters to care about, terrific set designs, and a effective mixture of action, science fiction, and horror.<br/><br/>What also makes it my favorite is the emotional relationship between Sigourney Weaver as Ripley and Newt, and their treatment of each other.  It is easy to sympathize with the Commando Unit because of their inability to deal with the aliens.  Aliens(1986) explores the fears of Ripley of what might happen to her.  The designs of the creatures were as good as usual. Aliens not only deals with the fear of the unknown, but also with facing up to fear.<br/><br/>The direction of James Cameron is first rate as well as the acting.  This is another movie where James Cameron comes up with a breathtaking climax as in his other films...I.E., The Terminator(1984), Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991), and True Lies(1994).  I recommand the Special Edition of Aliens for the following reasons.  First, it shows how the colony was infected with the alien virus.  Second, it is more detailed in explaining the mother-daughter relationship with Ripley and Newt(I also suggest watching Aliens in widescreen format)."

Weaver is dynamic as a woman who rationally understands what she's getting into but is brave enough to face her fears. As she must deal with aliens, sleazy (and dangerous) comapny man Burke, nurturing Newt and leading the defense against the Aliens, Weaver shows us a resourceful and brave woman.  Biehn is outstanding as the soft spoken Corporal Hicks, who proves to be the one person Ripley can turn to to lean on.  Biehn gives Hicks intelligence, authority, cool and bravery to create a memorable character.  We really feel that he grows to care deeply for Ripley and Newt.  Watch the scene where he cannons through bulletproof glass to save them.  Watch the scenes where he and Ripley quietly talk and realize how alike they are.  Great performances, great direction."

Intense, action-packed and fresh horror movie that is one of very few sequels regarded on the same plateau as the original. <br/><br/>This because Aliens is surprisingly subtle; in between the whole blood-and-guts routine, director Cameron simply continues the story of Ellen Ripley with an almost angelic feel - Aliens is like picking up a book to read the last half - not at all like watching a sequel.<br/><br/>Cameron can not get enough praise here as he obviously went to great length to recreate the same environment of the 1979 classic, but also to deliver the same feel and sense of endless tired space.<br/><br/>Aliens is an exciting and shock-filled grunts-in-space extravaganza with  first of all  some serious firepower and some major special effects; and in revealing an alien completely (quite a few of them actually) - compared to the one we never really saw in the original - the suspense and danger is still impressively maintained and actually enhanced. An immaculate accomplishment.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific once more. Like in Alien, the characters are intriguing and developed slowly, thus making us familiar with them. There is great dialogue throughout, and the clever, futuristic story will have you on the edge of your seat right until the end credits. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is again at center  she is nothing short of superb (was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award). Her sense of bewilderment and hatred transcends brilliantly.<br/><br/>Other standouts are Michael Biehn as Corporal Hicks and Lance Henriksen as the suspicious android, Bishop. It is a great supporting role for Biehn as the average joe with a heart of gold and a healthy common sense. Young Carrie Henn shines as the estranged little girl Newt. Also; add in Paul Reiser who is simply sensational as `company man' Carter Burke.<br/><br/>Watch those corners, people. And stay frosty."

Cameron wisely decides to not retrace the steps of Ridley Scott and goes for adrenaline-pumped action mixed with visceral tension, even more tense than Alien...just think of the motion tracker bleeping as the aliens get closer...genius! This is one of those movies you never want to end and I must have watched it 20 times at least. If you found the Alien concept from the original film interesting, you'll absolutely love this. No real flaws as far as I can think of...it's very long (I watched the Director's Cut) but the time flies by and I never really got bored - the strong storyline, wonderfully diverse characters and strong performances (especially from Weaver, Biehn and Henn) see to that. Unlike in Titanic, Cameron gets the dialogue exactly right here, especially with the rousing one-liners for the marines that have been shamelessly copied ever since.

When the closing credits make their way onto the screen you feel as though you have just gotten off a roller coaster--somewhat exhilarated, but also slightly disoriented and still trying to absorb everything that you've just experienced.<br/><br/>Best film of the series, Aliens really shines quite well as a stand-alone film.  Script alludes to the first film and leaves openings for future films, but does this unobtrusively so it isn't annoying.<br/><br/>A great film to watch late at night with all the lights turned off.

","If they ever do vote James Cameron ""King of the World,"" it'll probably be for Aliens, not Titanic.  It seems the consensus about Cameron's writing ability is mixed at best (the influence of Titanic, no doubt), but Aliens, even after 13 years, seems fresh, well-paced, and utterly engaging the whole length of it.<br/><br/>It's all the more remarkable considering that Cameron was working from Alien.  The plotlines flow smoothly into the new film, and several new themes are initiated and pursued, the most fruitful among them motherhood. We meet the alien ""mother,"" and Ripley takes in Newt as if she were her child.  (The special edition also includes information about Ripley's real daughter.)  It's a line that will be explored more in the next two films; thankfully, Cameron avoided biting off more that he could chew.<br/><br/>Aliens is also special for so successfully transforming a franchise from one genre (horror) to another (action), in the process setting new standards for action films.  Of course, the switch to action calls for certain concessions.  In order to present a war against aliens, Cameron makes them more corporeal and vulnerable.  In the original, the alien almost transcended physicality; as it dispatched some of its final victims, we see it moving slowly, arms outstretched, almost as if it were floating through water, confronting its victim face-to-face.  It was like death itself, inevitable, irresistable.  Cameron's aliens, though formidable, have just as much to fear from a bullet as any human.  The might of the alien is also lessened considerably with the change of location.  The nervous energy of Alien drew on the claustrophobia of a small crew on a single ship.  Aliens, located on a planet, noticeably lacks this.<br/><br/>Still, Aliens represents a moment when all of James Cameron's strengths came together, a moment that hasn't been repeated since."
"Xenomorph","8","0","0","14 October 1999"," Cameron's second best, and one of the very best science fiction films to date
","Aliens is absolutely one of the very best best sci-fi movies out there. And Cameron shows the audience one of his very best talents when it comes to directing: To, without any exceptions whatsoever, instantly keep up the level of excitement and fear. In some parts, it's a very predictable piece of film. Even when Ripley says something like ""I said no! I will not go there!"", you still know that she will, and you're not too surprised when Newt, of course, is the only one who gets caught by those slimy b***ards, but still make it. It feels like a cliche, but naturally everyone would hate the movie if she died. Including me. But not all things are predictable, you don't know when the humans will meet the aliens for the first time, and you don't know when they will come through the barricades. The fact that they came from above was just as logical as intelligent. I recently saw Aliens Special Edition, and that was really a lot better then the cinema-shown version. I can't believe why so much was cut out of that one. Personally, I think Aliens is Cameron's second best work so far. And a certain very well known three-hour ocean epic is in the lead. Terminator and it's superior sequel were a bit weaker, but still very good. As a matter of fact, James Cameron has only made two big mistakes in his career: 1) The directing of Piranha II: The Spawning (I haven't seen that one, but you don't need to see it to know it's crap) and 2) Writing parts of the script to Rambo: First Blood Part II (which by my opinion is one of the very worst films ever made). But he should be forgiven for these, that was just the beginning of his career... Aliens receives an 8 out of 10 from me."
"WDLN","Null","0","0","9 October 1999"," Interesting Musical Note on ""Aliens""
","IMDB user Collins writes about Aliens: ...On top of that, the pulsing music that plays while Bishop is speeding them away from the exploding compound and while Ripley is booting the Queen Alien out into space is beyond comparison...<br/><br/>I did a little research, and a lot of the music from Aliens is in fact borrowed from Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan (1982).  The original music for that film was also done by James Horner, who is credited as having done music for Aliens.  The music from the scene Collins describes where Bishop is piloting the ship away from the exploding nuclear plant is the same music used in several key chase scenes in ST II.  It worked equally as well in that movie.  I've also heard that particular piece in a numerous action-movie trailers, even though the piece was not actually used in the film it was promoting.  I do agree that it's a great suspense-building piece of music, and apparently so do a lot of movie producers.<br/><br/>Also, the slower music used at the beginning and over the credits of Aliens is from ""Ballet Suite Gayaneh"" by Aram Khachaturyan, a piece which was also used in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Patriot Games (1992).<br/><br/>Just an interesting sidebar, I thought."

Since I'm not a sci-fi fan, my favorable reaction to the film surprised me.  I think it's the genius of James Cameron that the human story is as important as the special effects.

","Aliens is as good as it gets, lots of action but there is no real horror as in Alien. I can´t understand why so many people claim Aliens as a masterpiece (not to say 'the best all time movie'). First, a masterpiece has to be original and there is very little of 'original' in this sequel, Alien is the movie that introduces the horrible monster, the planet, the alien spaceship, the facehuggers, the horrible lifecycle of the xenomorph, EVERYTHING! Aliens is just a very entertaining movie (don´t misunderstand me, I really like it) but it just follows the real original idea of the first movie but now with a bunch of marines with the idea of kicking some aliens' butt. Now, lets be sincere, that plot is not 'brilliant', it is adolescent and good to sell lots of bucks, and sure it did. As for Aliens being the best sci-fi around...hmm, go and watch, 2001, Bladerunner, Brazil or Alien, in this last you can FEEL how lonely and dark space can really be. Horror and terror? See Alien alone in the dark. Nevertheless, Alien and Aliens complement very well, a must see both, but don´t be fooled, the 'real' thing is the first one."

","I loved this movie when it came back in 1986. Just as I loved Terminator and Terminator 2. But Aliens and Terminator 2 haven't really aged that well. Camerons direction is thin and too obvious. There's no depth in the movie that helps you keep the interest up when watching it a second or third time. There are some excellent action scenes in Aliens, that's Camerons real strength as a director. That's unfortunately not the case with the dialog sequences. They feel stiff and artificial. As long as the space marines run around and shout at each other it's not a huge problem, that is, as long as you find shouting marines interesting. The references to Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers are a bit too obvious, especially the focus on the ""space- borne infantry"" (or marines in this movie), ""the drop"" and the units tactics and the ""bug hunt"". <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie it's of course a must see.

We are going to take the Alien movie, the classic horror movie in space...and we are going to turn it into an action movie in space and completely change the direction of the franchise to the point where people are going to be hesitant to go back to the horror in space formula that worked for alien.<br/><br/>And that is kind of what happened. The Alien franchise kind of lost its horror movie cred with Aliens to the point where Alien 3 got a lot of hate for trying to bring back the successful merger of horror and science fiction.<br/><br/>Aliens turned the franchise into a typical science fiction series...and that kind of hurts.<br/><br/>HOWEVER<br/><br/>You still have Ripley and Ripley is still a super cool hero.

It was still stylistic and fun.<br/><br/>So part of me hates Aliens for making that turn from horror to straight science fiction. But the other part of me recognizes it as a a very good movie for what it is with a great cast.<br/><br/>So I'm going to give it 10 out of 10 despite wanting it to be the same kind of film that Alien was.

"coenbmw","4","3","8","5 August 2018"," Wrong
","James Cameron could be prosecuted for having wrecked the magnificent atmosphere that 1979 Ridley Scott's Alien had created. In the original film, the Alien was a mysterious creature, almost invincible. It was pure horror, in space. Cameron came with the idea to transform this in a ""Rambo in space"", full of thick Marines so caricatural and grotesque that you wonder sometimes if this is parody. The worse is that, to be able to maintain this battle on the length of a film, Cameron had to weaken and banalize the Aliens, who become ordinary monsters that can be beaten with a classic weapon. You have to see how strangely slow and harmless they become, for Ripley to be able to slaughter a bunch of them on her way to salvation, all that with a kid on her arms.
For the rest, the film is well executed, technically impressive, and the subtle storyline Ripley/Newt involving Ripley's deceased daughter (that's in the Director's cut) is quite moving. And it's an Alien, so a film to watch anyway. But the concept of the film is wrong, by essence."
"shakur96","6","3","8","24 July 2003"," Good, but overrated and at times dated.
","I enjoyed this film although I disagree with many who thought this was the best of the four. It doesn't touch the first. It may have been made 7 years after Alien but Aliens looks far more dated, probably due to the more frequent and more ambitious special effects. The aerial shots in particular look badly dated, I think that Cameron, unlike Scott bit off more than he could chew in terms of use of technology at the time. Alien has and will continue to stand the test of time.<br/><br/>In addition the dialogue is poor and is made worse by one or two sub-standard performances, in particular Bill Paxton who was unconvincing in his nervous, worrying, ""what the f**K are we going to do"" soldier role. Though I enjoyed Paul Reiser & Lance Henriksen playing the roles of the menacing Hicks and the inhuman Bishop.<br/><br/>Overall a good film, one of the few good sequel movies, though certainly not worthy of neither the 8.2 score on imdb or the #83 rated movie on imdb (at July 2003). 6.5/10."

As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting.

"The_Void","10","3","9","14 October 2005"," The aliens are back...bigger, better and more!
","It has become customary among film fans to name Ridley Scott's original 'Alien' as the best of the series; but that is a notion that I cannot agree with. James Cameron's sequel is bigger, more ambitious, more exciting and just generally a better time than it's predecessor. The claustrophobic suspense-driven horror of the first film has thrown out of the window in favour of a more boisterous action stance. This would normally get on my nerves, but Cameron knows how to handle action so well that it's impossible not to go along with everything he shows on screen; and the switch from horror to action, therefore, is very much a good one. The plot is well thought out, and it follows the rescue of Ripley, the heroine of the first film, and it isn't long before she's being asked to go back into action. People have inhabited the planet where her crew picked up the first alien, and that population has become infested with bloodthirsty aliens. Enter a well-equipped team of space marines given the task of going in and finding out what the trouble is. Of course, it's more trouble than they ever imagined...<br/><br/>James Cameron said himself that he wanted to make aliens 'Vietnam in space' - and that's exactly what he's done. The marines are well equipped and trained, but that doesn't mean anything when you can't see your enemy. Like the Viet-Kong, the aliens blend into their background and strike without being seen. This idea benefits the film in two ways. Firstly, it gives it an intelligent edge, as it's not merely just humans blowing aliens to bits or vice versa, and secondly; it's far more exciting this way! The pivotal scene mid-way through the movie where we meet the aliens for the first time shows this best. The special effects in Aliens are great, and show the massive detrimental effect that CGI has had on cinema. All the effects here have been done properly, and they look far better than ninety-nine percent of the movies done with computers. It's much easier to buy into a film where someone has actually put effort into making the effects 'special', and that for me is worth the extra time, money and effort that real effects cost. My only complaint on the aesthetic front for the film is the cinematography. The atmosphere is downtrodden, so it suits the movie; but it also gives it a sort of nostalgic feel that the movie could do without.<br/><br/>The acting in Aliens is superb, with Sigourney Weaver heading an excellent ensemble. James Cameron has scripted a range of characters, and each of them is brought to life excellently by the cast. Weaver helps her character's development with some great subtle mannerisms, which help beyond the scripting that Cameron has given her. Michael Beihn, Carrie Henn, Paul Reiser and Jenette Goldstein are all solid in their roles and bring their characters to life excellently. Lance Henriksen stands out as the android 'Bishop'. You can really believe that he's an 'artificial person', which is quite difficult to do since he's playing something that doesn't actually exist. The real star of the show for me, however, has to be Bill Paxton. Like he's done so many times before and after, Paxton leads the film from the back and steals every scene he's in with his wisecracking and - later - mortal terror. The film is solidly directed, with James Cameron implementing suspense, emotion and action brilliantly at every point that it's needed, and overall I don't hesitate to call this the greatest Action Sci-Fi film ever made, and one of cinema's best on the whole."

","Without a doubt, one of the best movies ever, one of the greatest horror films of the 80's and the best movie of 1986.
The film had one of the best special effects I've ever seen (looks like a recent movie), had a fantastic story, had a fantastic soundtrack and a very good sound mix.
I think this is the best James Cameron movie (tied with ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") and I think it's one of those movies that everyone should watch (even if they do not like science fiction or horror).
Highly recommend."

","A worthy successor to the first Alien movie! Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley delivering am excellent performance and development for her character. Other characters are kipled of willy-nilly but some did survive longer and one survived the whole encounter. James Cameron captures the correct ambiance for a horror flick. The Aliens looked even better as well."
"nickboldrini","10","2","5","16 August 2018"," Let's rock!
","One of my favourite films. An action war film, in which its ok to cheer every kill - they're not human after all. The Aliens architecture is both mesmerising and terrifying, the Colonial Marines are a great military squad, with all the banter and bravado that comes with it, as well as some cool kits - M41a Pulse rifles, APC, gunships. This is space as a battlefield, even though its mainly planetside. And although an action/war film, it still has some nice sci fi elements - Waldos, suspended animation, shake and bake colonies. A perfect mix of elements, nicely paced and shot, with enough characterisation for you to be rooting for the marines as they go down, or cheering when Carter does."
"FallenEye","6","2","5","7 May 2018"," Alien, Just With the ""S"", But Without the ""Cott"".
","Okay, so in the 80's, a character like Ripley could earn one an Oscar Nomination, but today, a character like The Matrix's Trinity and especially Katniss Everdeen, will never even bring you close to a Nomination, when Sigourney's performance was satisfactory to be fair, playing a type of character very similar to the above mentioned and not even as well? This of course isn't Aliens' fault, but I feel it adds to the acclaim that it garnered.<br/><br/>I have no problem with Aliens, except for the fact that, to be honest, it was an almost frame by frame replica of Alien, except a larger everything, from cast to explosions, to a greater population of well, the very same aliens, with them attacking the same way, being beaten the same way and the suspense being executed, the exact same way.<br/><br/>Also, because of the carbon copy, the series quite literally couldn't progress. The only thing further we now know is that, there is a ""queen alien"". But, where do they come from? Why and how are they on LV426? What inhabited the planet before their arrival? What are these aliens? What's their agenda? What happened to their planet/home? All these questions, with an entire 2 hrs 30 minutes addressing non of them and rehashing what Ridley had already covered.<br/><br/>The effects are excellent, and yes, Cameron is an accomplished, world renowned director, and respected in all corners of the world, however, Cameron in this case just copy pasted Scott's work, with a bigger budget. The film itself is done well, but the vision is redone, well.<br/><br/>I really, and truly want to love this film and series, but in this particular installment, it's incredibly difficult to ignore Cameron's major shortcoming. From there, this movie also had it's own problems, as well as its own successes, and ultimately, it was a film well made, albeit it, a film remade. 6/10."
"grabo-57156","9","2","5","17 April 2018"," Violence is needed for survival
","Throughout ALIENS, never once are you left wondering if the action is over. The suspense the movie evokes into one is uncommon from an 80's film. There are a plethora of reasons as to why James Cameron's film was such a hit, and many times have they been pointed out. The acting by Weaver and Paxton were phenomenal, and yes the suspense the Xenomorph can induce is petrifying, but one thing that does not get mentioned often is the tale that the story really tells.<br/><br/>ALIENS is an action movie, and within that, it tells a story of survival. Many say that the film is a story of an invasion gone wrong, but they would be the ones in the wrong. ALIENS is a film where one crew of space marines and Ellen Ripley are sent to defend the human race. The movie is not portrayed that way, but underneath it all, had Ripley not done what she did, the fate of humans could have been forever changed. ALIENS is not a glorification of war, it is instead the opposite. It demonstrates the horrors of war, but also provides evidence as to why violence is necessary at times.<br/><br/>Through all the blood and acid, the takeaway from ALIENS is not a story of aggression gone wrong, but a final stand in which the human race was victorious. The story line of ALIENS is due to the direct actions of ALIEN, but that is for another review. ALIENS was not intended to be a film that approved of unnecessary force, it was a film that showed how the human race survived through self defense."

","Fantastic sequel! This was even better than the first movie. The action scenes were plentiful and non-stop once they started. There were so many more aliens, with explosions and gun fire all over the place. Parts of the story were very similar - the political agenda and the last minute alien space float - but the overall plot was new and more interesting. It's hard to expand on characters when there are so many in one movie, but we did get to see a wider view of Ripley's backstory and an expansion of her personality. You can tell that she grew as a character and a fighter. <br/><br/>I love that the aliens aren't CGI. You can't beat having something real in the shot for the actors to interact with. It is more visceral and makes the performance believable. Plus I think that is part of why these movies hold up. If the aliens had been computer animated they would have been held back by the technology of the era. With the puppets you get a realism that makes a huge difference. Aliens did not disappoint."

If you haven't seen it before I implore you to watch it, but be prepared it's a scare fest. This is always the answer to the question when someone asks, can you name a sequel that was better then the original? answer yes this one!! Sheer utter brilliance.

"dworldeater","9","2","5","28 September 2015"," Brilliant sequel
","Aliens is James Cameron at his best in this very ambitious and action packed sequel to Ridley Scott's classic Alien. There are certain aspects of the film that don't come off as well as the first one. Such as the horror elements and HR Giger's superior design of the alien. However, James Cameron is an insane talent and brought his vision to the screen with high efficiency. Siguorney Weaver returns again as Ripley and delivers an outstanding performance that is vulnerable, intelligent and tough. It was impressive enough to get a nomination for best actress that year.(which was pretty much unheard of for sci fi, action and horror, genres the academy usually ignores) There are also some iconic and very memorable performances from Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Hendrickson and Jenette Goldstein. Aliens has a dark tone and packs a mean punch with heavy doses of action. Aliens blend the genres of horror, action, drama and science fiction well. James Cameron is a guy who is a jack of all trades in film and also as a director and storyteller knows what he wants, as well as how to best achieve it. So, with the aid of his very talented crew the f/x, set designs, camera-work and editing are all top notch. Aliens is a great sequel and a classic that in the sci fi/action realm is tough to beat."
"TBase3","10","2","5","26 May 2015"," This is how you do a sequel
","If you love movies you have to see this. It's a classic from the genius of James Cameron. The perfect sequel to one of the most perfect films of all time.<br/><br/>Back when James Cameron did 'art house' films he made this. It has all the grit of the original film but takes it in an entirely new direction, one that I personally favor over the original. The only negative I can say about this film is that Cameron never returned to the franchise (and what a shame that was). The queen alien will forever be one of the most iconic monsters in all film history, along with Ripley, and Sarah Connor they make up the baddest most amazing females in cinema history."
"JaydoDre","8","2","5","3 January 2015"," Still one of the best action movies of all times
","I need to get a little personal here to properly explain the situation.<br/><br/>Aliens, has long been one of my favorite movies, and ever since I was a kid, it held preference over its predecessor, Alien. I recognized that the first film was an high quality product, but it was scary and there were not nearly enough explosions. Its sequel, on the other hand, contained much of the aesthetic and story of the first film but was encased in a much more palatable (for a kid at least) action movie skin. However, as an adult, having watched the two movies back to back I see that both movies are showing some unfortunate seams, but those seams are bigger on the 2nd film.<br/><br/>The tension in the first film was palpable right from the beginning. Aliens feels much more relaxed. In part, this is because the said Aliens are much more vulnerable this time around, but there are other reasons that are sadly a symptom of a reduction in quality. For example, the first film had creepy sound effects mixed in with the space music that made the exploration really tense. Aliens does not have that, or at least very little.<br/><br/>Right at the beginning, something bad happens but then the character just wakes up and it turns out to be a dream. You know, if I saw some movie do that trick for the first time I would have called it a smart trick, but since so many thrillers started doing the waking up from a bad dream trick, it has become a hated cliché.<br/><br/>The writing is of mixed quality. Most of the lines uttered by the marines in the first half of the film are bad. I understand that the creators were trying to make the marines out as macho grunts but what they ended up with are exaggerated gestures and cheesy meaningless lines made out of messed up army lingo, like when ""fire in the hole"" is meant literally. The thing is, even the dumb dialogue contributes to the overall atmosphere and some of the lines have become iconic quotes.<br/><br/>The characters are fun and memorable. Little bits, some of them silly, can be great. A guy wakes up from hibernation and his first action is to put a cigar in his mouth. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is back of course as the strong female lead. She is strong but vulnerable, which is a popular hero type because a character like that is relatable. Paul Reiser is really good. His character is realistic and the way it is revealed over the course of the film feels natural. A little adorable girl Newt is played by Carrie Henn. Newt is cute kid but the quality of her acting varies. Either way she does not talk a lot. Aliens is one of Bill Paxton's most famous movie's. He overacts a bit, but remains very entertaining. Nobody in this film is bad.<br/><br/>The music is not as tense and integrated with the film as in the first film but nonetheless the film does have really iconic action music formed around the core of army snare drums and metallic percussion.<br/><br/>The design of the humans world has been improved over the first film. The colony buildings and the various machines look really cool. It highly recommended that you watch directors' cut to not miss out on any of that. Yes, small CRT screens look outdated by their size and static just adds to the creepy atmosphere. The Aliens look quite good. Their movements are a little clunky, but on the upside no CGI was used to put the on screen and film cuts are done professionally to make aliens as realistic as possible. This helps the movie to age well.<br/><br/>There are still visual issues though. There are a number of scenes where mock up models are superimposed onto a different background, possibly using green-screen, and it does not look that good. There is an outline visible around the objects and it simply looks odd. Strangely enough, the first film did not have this problem nearly as much as it did not try to add so many effects with moving vehicles.<br/><br/>Aliens has some of the most quoted memorable lines but also a whole lot of weak ones. The music is pretty cool. The action is good too but there is not as much tension. Despite the flaws, the atmosphere and the characters are so good that Aliens can rightfully be called one of the best action movies of all times as well as one of the best sci-fi movies."
"hellraiser7","10","2","5","2 November 2012"," Final Fronteer Warfare
","As much as I loved the first film I love this film even more. Believe it or not this film is actually my second favorite film of all time, I've seen this when I was about 11 and I still love it even today. This wasn't just a film it was a phenomenon as well as one unforgettable experience. It really set the bar form most sci-fi visual mediums we have now like TV shows (Battlestar Galatica revival, EXO Squad, and the criminally underrated Space, Above, and Beyond)as well as became a big influence on video games (Contra, Gears of War, Halo, Dead Space). This film gave us a new way of looking at sci-fi, it was final frontier sci-fi at it's best where it looked futuristic, realistic, believable and accessible.<br/><br/>The world is great, this idea of a military of the future let alone in space, the technology that accompanies it. Spaceships, the weapons which look like advanced models of the ones we have now, portable flame units and my the pulse rifles, the sound of the rifles is awesome. The concept of artificial terror forming which gives us the power to make any planet we want habitable. However my favorite technology is the Power Loader, it was the first time I've ever seen a mecha ever, it's basically a simple construction vehicle nothing special in that world but in my eyes just the way it moved and worked I waned to drive one of those things.<br/><br/>Music by James Horner one of my favorite composers is great, the score is just fantastic it's just has that exciting and epic feel to it.<br/><br/>The effects and production value are superb because it's all practical most from my favorite effects guy the late great Stan Winston. Nothing was half baked the amount of detail in construction they really put a hell of a lot of effort and it shows. I love the dark atmosphere, just the use of limited light and darkness almost gives the film a slight Gothic foreboding sensibility to it as if there could be danger hiding behind one corner or another, you wouldn't know it will hit you until it's too late. The fact that there is more than one Zenomorph in this film and one new one which is the Queen Alien, it is the most gigantic intimidating monster I've ever seen it scared me when I was a kid and still makes me nervous ever time I see it.<br/><br/>All that makes the danger all the more increased and puts you on red alert the whole way through. Usually with one monster you have many opportunities to evade but when it comes to an army of them your chances are slim. The way there handled, their behavior they were primal but not stupid. The fight with them was made similar to the Vietnam war and the Zenomorphs were sort of made to be like the Viet Cong who utilized gorilla tactics to bring down their opponents and undermine the high technology they have. The film of course also has that little underline message on humanity versus corruption and dehumanization. Demonstrated from the parallel between the evil destructive Zenomorphs and the unfeeling, cold blooded, destructive Weyland company that is willing to commit murder and breach ethical boundaries in both science and humanity all to make a fast profit.<br/><br/>There are a lot of memorable things that were scary like the use of the portable radar and the sound it makes really put me on the edge of my seat, however one part of the film made me jump when Hicks looks up at the ceiling and sees a whole horde of Zenomorphs. As a kid that actually scarred me because I remembered my house had an attic I was afraid those things might be crawling up there. Down to the action sequences which are great their well choreographed, from seeing Ripley going all out in an alien hive but my favorite and it's no surprise is the fight with Ripley in the power loader against the Queen which is one of my favorite fights ever.<br/><br/>The character are colorful, interesting as well as memorable. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) a really tough as nails woman with the attitude to go with it, she's awesome my third favorite character and one of the most memorable female fatales in movies ever in my book. Dwane Hicks (Michael Bien) is my second favorite because he's the most level headed leader sort of a calm authoritative figure but also just a bad ass, from what he says to his actions. But of course my favorite no surprise is Ellen Ripley (Sigorney Wever) her character helped set the bar for the female fatales to come (Buffy, Betrix Kiddo, Lara Croft, you name it) and she's still number one in my book. From her leadership ability toward the Space Marines which is great she should of been a Space Marine Commander, or even a Commando seeing her going against the Zenomorphs and kicking ass just shows she's a bad ass as well. However it's the emotion she carries which makes her feel all so human. You can't help but feel for her from what she sees and feels from her facial and emotional expressions you see she is a person that is driven by internal rage, from her feelings toward the heartless Weyland company she worked for, her post traumatic experiences, the fact she has nothing really to come back to since her daughter is now deceased. The only thing she really has left is her unstoppable determinations toe save and protect everything that is good from evil of any form because she still believes in the value of humanity, that it's always worth fighting for.<br/><br/>Aliens is an experience that take you to space, above, and beyond.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"
"schapman74","9","2","5","16 October 2012"," A classic
","What can I say, what a classic! Throughout the years, Aliens has remained one of my top five movies of all time, and despite having been filmed in 1986, has aged remarkably well.<br/><br/>It's a brilliant story, and while I have no intention of giving anything away, Ripley's return to LV-426 with a kick-ass compliment of marines sets the stage just nicely for what would prove to be an epic showdown.<br/><br/>While James Cameron is arguably one of the better directors out there, I consider his earlier works, such as this, Terminator, The Abyss and T2, to be far superior to his more recent releases.<br/><br/>Amidst an otherwise dull sky for the aliens franchise, this is the star that shines brightest for me. Highly recommended!"

"chaos-rampant","Null","2","5","18 September 2012"," The machinery of narrative
","You simply cannot fail to study the Alien films. Individually, they range from great to below-average, but the journey and transformation of vision is fascinating and precious. It starts with Dune, the scrapped Jodorowsky version. The ambitious project collapsed, scattering the team of visionaries. In the meantime, Star Wars came out through the more business-savvy Spielberg-Lucas model and convinced execs that something like Dune can be done if you build with dedication from bankable parts instead of trusting genius.<br/><br/>Alien was brilliant - all about the dissonance of different kinds of logic working in discovery of the same thing.<br/><br/>This is something else entirely. The second explosion was that the Star Wars-Alien success was so immense, pieces of their mechanism rained all over Hollywood: new SFX worlds, ambition, coherent mythology. Several Scott-originated ideas for a second Alien were quickly proposed, most of them dumb (eventually retooled into Prometheus). Lucas had his own. Meanwhile, the Roger Corman factory was hard at work picking apart the films to build their own miniature models. The story goes that a young truck-driver, awestruck by Star Wars, decided to pursue screen writing, and naturally drifted to Corman's stable. <br/><br/>Anyway, young Cameron got his break doing second unit work in the Alien-inspired Galaxy of Terror, which led to the Piranha gig. Long before any of us would know him as mogul and overambitious despot on set, the guy was a workhorse, a whiz-kid of DIY filmmaking. And he was getting hands-on practice right in the middle of an assembly-line where he had to puzzle about dressing and refitting all those spare parts. And you can again see all of that in the finished film here, only his second one. <br/><br/>Nevermind the shift of tone from horror to action and war. We go from Scott's journey of dissonant discovery to one of efficiently getting a job done. From the shared adventure to uncharted space and new vision, to one woman's obsessive vision of something she knows and has to exterminate.<br/><br/>As a result, you go from a film of multiple individually-perfected fabrics and different machinery, remember in Alien you went from Giger's biomechanoid alien ship, to the clean Kubrick-space of Mother's room, to the scrapyard maze of Nostromo's bowels, and different cameras for each space, to one man doing all, one fabric of camera and one practical logic throughout.<br/><br/>There is no dissonant intrusion of alien- space and logic, like you had when injecting Moebius and Giger- fluid disharmony into Scott's clean vision. Both humans and aliens exist in the same workshop-space, and that blue-collar workspace of junk, papers and spare parts everywhere must have been the feel of the Corman factory of disassembling vision for study that Cameron intimately knew.<br/><br/>And that emphasis on making something work shows in the creature itself (the product of vision) and the introduction of narrative for the encounter with it.<br/><br/>In the original, you had the volatile omnipresence in shadows of something mysterious and ever-shifting that was not human at all, but an abstract being you understood had inscrutable biology and purpose. There was no narrative, we knew nothing about it.<br/><br/>In Cameron's practical vision that's scaled down from near-metaphysical presence to a much more understood critter, understood both in terms of structure (beehive and presence of a Queen, Cameron-designed no less) and understood in terms of story, motherhood. Meanwhile Ripley herself in that outer space of unreason is slaying her own darkness.<br/><br/>Those are not at all bad choices: clarity in both mechanics and narrative logic, practical purpose, no dissonance, efficient tension.<br/><br/>It is just different to the original journey, less dangerous. It is a workingman's assembly-vision of what he does, building worlds. It works, he was extraordinarily competent with the parts. So competent in fact, that Spielberg himself had to sit down and take notice."

","Aliens is a science fiction action film directed by James Cameron and starring Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, William Hope, and Bill Paxton. A sequel to the 1979 film Alien, Aliens follows Weaver's character Ellen Ripley as she returns to the planet where her crew encountered the hostile Alien creature, this time accompanied by a unit of Colonial Marines.Big-budget special effects, swiftly paced action, and a distinct feminist subtext from writer/director James Cameron turned what should have been a by-the- numbers sci-fi sequel into both a blockbuster and a seven-time Oscar nominee.<br/><br/>Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, the last surviving crew member of a corporate spaceship destroyed after an attack by a vicious, virtually unbeatable alien life form. Adrift in space for half a century, Ripley grapples with depression until she's informed by her company's representative, Carter Burke that the planet where her crew discovered the alien has since been settled by colonists. Contact with the colony has suddenly been lost, and a detachment of colonial marines is being sent to investigate. Invited along as an adviser, Ripley predicts disaster, and sure enough, the aliens have infested the colony, leaving a sole survivor, the young girl Newt. With the soldiers picked off one by one, a final all-female showdown brews between the alien queen and Ripley, who's become a surrogate mother to Newt. <br/><br/>It's interesting that the film, a sequel to Ridley Scott's atmospheric horror-film-in-space, is generally regarded as an action movie. Go through it, and you'll realize the character and dialogue scenes far outweigh the kablooey stuff.Also,the sequel is sequel is bigger, faster, scarier.And most of all,while Alien was a marvel of slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs a much more visceral punch, and features a typically strong performance from Sigourney Weaver."

"mini_productions-2008","6","2","5","8 August 2009"," Aliens is slow paced but in the end pays off.
","Aliens is not perfect. Contrary to belief it is though, Aliens directed by Terminator man James Cameron sees our favorite Xenomorph busting hero Ellen Ripley return. The story is through maybe first 40 to 50 minutes is slow paced and boring. But, then around the last hour or so the action picks up and you have a facehugger here and a facehugger there and everywhere, plus Xenomorphs who just don't want to seem to die. In the end as usual Ripley sets off a self destruct mechanism for the ship she is on and has ""so and so"" amount of time to get out. Well, this time she has a couple of friends accompanying her and by that i also mean the Queen Xenomorph. So, we finally meet the mother behind all of this and well frankly she puts up a damn good fight, she even manages to follow Ripley off the ship and fights Ripley to the death. At the end though you have the same ending, Ripley fights big alien and alien gets sucked into the space vacuum, very simple. Overall I'd advise you to watch Alien first and if you liked RENT Aliens. Bottom Line, rent this first, you may be disappointed."
"ciscokid1970","9","2","5","30 October 2006"," Best of the Alien films
","Certainly the best of the Alien films. This movie is great on so many levels. One of the best SciFi / Horror films ever. It is one of the best Female Hero movies of all time. And it even has enough explosions and firefighting to qualify as a ""Guy Movie"".<br/><br/>Yeah I liked the original Alien movie because it was well acted and had a fantastic idea. And it was certainly the first time I ever saw a evil creature pop out of someones chest.<br/><br/>But the second one was absolutely fantastic. More monsters, more explosions, improved she-hero and even a bit of comedy sprinkled in there (thanks to Bill Paxton's character).<br/><br/>This is still one of my favorite movies to watch in my Home theater room due to the brilliant filming and sound.<br/><br/>One last thing...Sigourney Weaver holding heavy firearm...very sexy."
"curl-6","10","2","5","24 June 2006"," Best sequel of all time
","Almost all sequels fall prey to one of two pitfalls: either they simply rehash the original, or they try to be too different and lose all the things that made the original good. Jim Cameron's Aliens strikes a perfect balance, retaining everything that was cool in Alien (1979) while still taking the film to an entirely new level. (Action as opposed to horror) <br/><br/>This film really does have it all: spine-chilling suspense, pulse-pounding action, beautiful (in a eerie, gooey way) scenery, colourful and memorable characters, an intelligent script, superb direction, believable acting, thrilling music, and special effects that still look AWESOME, even in today's CGI-infested world.<br/><br/>This is one of the only sequels I can think of that actually surpasses the original. But more importantly, its a cinematic masterpiece in its own right, and an almost perfect movie."
"CrazyBomber","10","2","5","19 June 2006"," My favorite
","I haven't written any comment in ages, so here's my tribute to this fine piece of art: It was the first horror movie I saw (when I was twelve), and not only did it freak me out (in a good way), it was also very interesting.<br/><br/>To this day, I must have seen this movie at least 20 times. I love it every time.<br/><br/>Weaver's performance was absolutely great. How can we compare today's chick's action movies with these ""old-school"" classics? It's not a fair comparison. Back in the days, the actresses were chosen for their ability, unlike today, where ""cuteness"" and ""hotness"" rule who's in and who's out. It's a skill vs beauty contest, and my vote goes to skill. Definitely.<br/><br/>So, if you haven't seen this movie, if you like action/horror movies, if you think Jessica Biel is a good actress, and if you like Aeon flux... you're scratching the bottom of the barrel, so please forget about that ""crap"" and go get this great great movie.<br/><br/>It's my favorite of all 4.<br/><br/>How do you know when a movie is really really good? When you try so hard to pick on something but you just can't. I know I can't find anything wrong with this one, so I give it a perfect 10 :)"

","I used to watch this movie frequently as a kid and was enthralled by the daunting atmosphere and violent chaos. I would cheer along with my brothers and Dad as we shouted out nearly every line as the characters spoke them on screen. I remember vividly not being able to sleep some nights as a result of LV426, Ripley, and the facehuggers. My brothers and I went to far as to play ""Alien Search."" A game of our own design in which we'd run around the house with the lights out, toting plastic guns, hunting invisible aliens. We'd make spit-inducing machine gun sounds until our lips were numb. Now, rewatching it as an adult, the movie has grown only more engrossing. New layers of the plot continue to reveal themselves and the environment of the futuristic world become reinvigorated with every viewing. No other movie swiftly and thoroughly obliterates a handful of hugely likable characters in such a convincing way. I could watch this movie every day for a month and not tire of it."
"MovieAddict2016","8","2","5","30 June 2004"," Review of the director's cut
","This review had to be chopped a bit to fit under the maximum word limit.<br/><br/>""They mostly come at night...mostly.""<br/><br/>The vessel drifts eerily through the vacant outer reaches of space. There is total silence as the opening credits begin to spread across the screen, and then the words JAMES CAMERON ignite with an overwhelming sense of joy. Yes, this is a James Cameron film, perhaps the way he originally envisioned ""Alien"" (1979), or at least thought he could improve upon it.<br/><br/>Many critics and moviegoers often consider Cameron's film, released in 1986, superior to the first film. Because the two films are quite different in approach to the entire concept of aliens, it's hard to compare them. Instead it's quite easy to say that they share a deep chemistry of sorts, whereas each entry compliments the other's own flaws. ""Alien"" was a rather slow, brooding, dark study of humans abandoned in an unnatural, man-made environment, faced with a deadly foe; mother nature's crème de le crème of big bad monsters. There was only one alien in the first film, and it stalked them mercilessly, unseen. Even by the end of the film there was much mystery surrounding the alien itself. In short, ""Alien"" was a horror film. ""Aliens"" is not.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is a cold-blooded, terrifying action movie, pumped full of Cameron's own ever-present unique blend of adrenaline, machoism and suspense. Its lead hero is actually a heroine, the only returning character from the first film, Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver as one of the most reluctant screen characters of all time. The company that owned the Nostromo space ship she blew up at the end of ""Alien"" saves her. It's over 50 years later, her daughter is dead, and everything she has come to know and recognize in her life disappears in a matter of minutes when she is awoken from a deep sleep and informed of all this by Burke (Paul Reiser). Chairmen of the company who take away her pilot's license, believing she is crazy and delusional, mentally disturbed by whatever happened on the Nostromo, debrief her. Days go by until activity is recorded on the planet from the first film -- which is now colonized. The planet where Ripley's crew originally discovered the alien that made its way onto the ship and murdered everyone...except her.<br/><br/>Burke offers Ripley an enticing deal: If she goes to the planet with a group of marines, they will give her back the freedom she desires. Cautiously, she agrees, and is shipped out with a group of Colonel Marines, including Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn), Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), Lt. Gorman (William Hope), Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), and Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews). After arriving at their destination the crew soon realizes that the activity is indeed related to the extra-terrestrial. There are no civilians in sight -- it seems everyone has disappeared. The single survivor is Newt (Carrie Henn), a brave young girl who has been hiding in the ventilation shafts of the colony for, apparently, quite some time.<br/><br/>The action soon begins as the aliens wake up from their slumber within the walls of the colony and attack their new guests. Ripley, relying upon her own experiences with one of the creatures, leads the crew as the casualties soon amount and revelations are made about the species.<br/><br/>James Cameron is one of the most visionary directors of all time, a man whose idea for ""The Terminator"" was sparked by the single image of an endoskeleton rising from fiery flames. His ""Terminator"" is arguably his finest masterpiece. Even to this day, with ""T2,"" ""The Abyss,"" and ""Titanic"" under his belt, it is rivaled but not surpassed.<br/><br/>To be fair most people seem to think ""Aliens"" is a super-fast roller coaster-ride of a movie, when in fact it is also a very long film -- the director's cut roughly two and a half hours long, longer than the first film. Then why does it seem so short to so many viewers? Because of its direction. Cameron's dark atmosphere retains the vision of the original ""Alien"" but the scope and ideas are entirely different; this is a film about shooting, yelling, running, and lots of blood and guts, which isn't to say it's a stupid film...just a very fun one.<br/><br/>Cameron has commented on the film's Vietnam-related themes, although they're rather outlandish. To be sure, the film does indeed use war as a backdrop. The film's tagline was ""This Time It's War!"" -- something Cameron claims he made up after deciding to promote his movie as a war picture, not a slow-moving epic in the vein of the original.<br/><br/>Both films are amazing in their own right, and about equal in comparison in many different ways, but what Cameron does is improve upon the first film's action, acting and aliens in general. The first movie, aptly titled ""Alien"" (as it was not about any more than one of the species), has far better landscapes, and although both directors are wonderful Scott is generally better at evoking the paranoia of space. Cameron doesn't do that because he doesn't need to. The acting by all involved is top-notch, with Paxton especially stealing the scenes as the whiny and constantly worried (but never quite annoying) marine. The writing is fairly good, given the material, and the action is some of the best you'll ever see."
"Mr_Triboro","7","2","5","19 August 2003"," At least he didn't give us 'Piranha 2' again
","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>In a way, a sequel to Alien was inevitable. It didn't need one, of course, but the Hollywood profit machine saw fit to churn one out. And, compared to the likes of 'Jaws 3' ('Jaws: The Revenge' does not technically count as a film) they could have done a lot worse.<br/><br/>It was pretty obvious that any sequel to 'Alien' was going to have a hard time on it's hands. Ridley Scott chose to reveal his monster at the end of his film which meant nobody was really going to be scared of it lurking in the shadows any more. What James Cameron instead chose to do was give us more aliens. Lots of them. That way we'd be scared of overwhelming opposition. And how do we defeat lots of aliens? The only way Jim knows how: guns.<br/><br/>'Aliens' handles the continuing story of Ripley well, when they could have easily chucked it all away. It also remains faithful to the 'mother and child' undercurrent that was present in Alien (in a warped way, of course) by reinventing Ripley and the alien as mothers. 'Aliens' is hailed as one of the greatest action films ever made and it may be. What's amusing about that statement is there is probably less than ten minutes of action in the entire film. <br/><br/>So, if I'm lavishing all this praise on 'Aliens' then why did I only give it seven out of ten? Well, my reason is this: 'Aliens' single-handedly ruined 'Alien's' legacy and gave all the sequels the excuse to be substandard. A lot of the criticism people hurl at 'Alien3' and 'Resurrection' is present in 'Aliens' yet people can't or won't see it because it has ""badass marines in it!""<br/><br/>One of the main problems is James Cameron hauls all the cliche action characters he can think of out of the woodwork for his film, from the quiet but resilient corporal to the loudmouth private who goes to pieces to the butch hard-as-nails woman. And these are the characters we even RECOGNIZE before they die! A far cry from the gritty and realistic characters of it's predecessor.<br/><br/>But my main problem with 'Aliens' is what it reduces it's title stars to. Ridley Scott gave us this uncomprehendable nightmare in 'Alien' In 'Aliens' we have Hudson wondering if ""maybe it's like an ant hive!"" And, sure enough, 'Aliens' saves the big finale until last when we meet the alien queen. Sure, it's impressive and well designed but it isn't scary. None of these new aliens James Cameron decides to give us are scary. The horror, the mysteriousness and the intelligence present in the original 'Alien' are now only reserved for the alien queen. James Cameron has successfully turned the most innovative, unique and terrifying creature in to mindless cannon fodder. An interstellar termite. <br/><br/>The effects of 'Aliens' are also starting to date, the dropship sequence in particular doesn't compare to the shots of the Nostromo in 'Alien' And the suits themselves look uncomfortably hokey, like rejects from a Japanese monster movie. <br/><br/>If you want a good action movie, watch 'Aliens' If you want a scary monster movie, watch 'Alien'"
"insectus","6","2","5","2 April 2001"," A miracle
","Yes, indeed a miracle. This is one of the few movies that follows up and changes the formula of an excellent film and doesn't loose anything at all in quality, relative to its genre. In a very clever way, this movie transports the universe from the sci-fi epic ""alien"" into an action movie that is probably the best of its type. James Cameron shows great talent while directing this film, always keeping connections to the Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" so that the idea of sequel isn't broken despite the great difference between the films. The acting is good, and excellent in the case of Sigourney Weaver (however, how polemic this may sound, I think she's even better in Alien 3). The plot is very simple like in the first movie, but as the few twists come it becomes quite convencing. The special effects are quite good for its time showing a clear improvement from the first movie. The alien queen is quite impressing. The action sequences are memorable and have inspired many ""imitations"" in other movies and even in some video games. This film only receives a worst score than the first because if we put aside the different genres, the movie itself is quite worst than the first, it is in the action genre that it is great."
"mortlock_roo","6","3","10","13 June 2007"," Definitely the worst film in the Alein series, but still worth a watch.

The visual effects are still very good due to the huge amount of money that was poured into making the film, but it's the seriously bad acting and tacky storyline that let it down.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film which was a very good and atmospheric horror, this is more like a typical cheesy action film, with lots of flashy special effects to try and keep audiences amused.

"johnnyboyz","7","2","6","30 April 2019"," Going bigger and slightly better, Cameron's ""Alien"" sequel pulls off everything it attempts.
","There is a moment about half way through James Cameron's ""Aliens"" which seems to very deliberately turn back to its 1979 predecessor and say 'yeah, I see your effort, and I raise you'. It occurs when a bevy of soldiers are trooping through the remains of a settlement on a desolate moon: it has been ransacked by a series of violent creatures whose sole purpose is to seemingly seek organisms and attack them. As they march through the crime scene, we realise that they are essentially traversing an area which has seen events play out that were very similar to the first film: a group of (largely) unarmed people trying to defend themselves from these animals in a zone they cannot escape. ""Aliens"", however, is just getting out of second gear by this point...<br/><br/>Cameron's film somehow manages to go bigger and, dare I say it, a bit better than ""Alien"" - marrying the genres of action; horror and science-fiction to excellent effect. Indeed, like the best of anything science-fiction has to offer, you get the feeling you are in another world - a world of superior artificial intelligence, of space vehicles designed for things we are still a long way from pioneering ourselves and of distant worlds.<br/><br/>The terror Cameron seems able to inject into proceedings stems, I think, from knowing there are multiple enemies; indeed, an endless supply, about whom we know very little but always seem to be conniving to get you one way or another. One would think lots of these creatures dumped into a film alongside a group of gun-toting protagonists would make for a disaster after the menacing calm of the first film - perhaps I once thought that myself, but having seen the film again recently, I'm of the opinion that Cameron executes the material really well.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" begins with a military-style drum roll over the opening credits, briefly foreshadowing the militaristic content this edition will possess. We pick up, quite literally, where the first film ended: the lone human survivor of the transport ship Nostromo, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is drifting through space in an escape capsule. When she is found, a rare and amusing moment occurs: an outside agent, totally unaware of what they have stumbled upon, crack open the door and send in a probe to make sure it's safe - they are afraid of what we know is perfectly fine, and yet we as an audience are unsure of what has found our heroine and so are oddly uneasy as well.<br/><br/>When Ripley comes around, the film allows us to share in her shock at the fact some 57 years have passed since the events of the first film. She has lost a daughter who has outlived her and, gut-wrenchingly, entire families have since settled on the moon the initial alien's biological origins were discovered. Her only friend amidst a sea of disapproving bureaucrats, unsympathetic to her story, is a smooth-talking company employee named Burke (Paul Riser), whose pleasant manner makes certain later reveals all that more surprising...<br/><br/>Burke wants Ripley to traverse to the moon when, inexplicably, communications with the settlement suddenly cease, only he wants her to accompany a platoon of marines, as she has first-hand experience of the creature and nobody can take any chances... What Cameron does impressively here is he allows for the opening act to calmly break us into this sequel, which is at once both very similar to ""Alien"" but very different: loose ends are tied up, Ripley becomes grounded again; we sneak a glimpse of mugshots of the first crew on a monitor; she accepts her daughter's death and even reconciles with the cat of the first film.<br/><br/>Once Cameron senses we are ready to roll, act two arrives, and the film begins to play games: the marines themselves strike us as unprofessional in their messing around and cracking crude jokes. They are not especially well-drilled - one of them even seems to echo the dialogue of the doomed crew of the first when they speak about not being paid enough; the commander confuses two marines, Hudson (Michael Biehn) and Hicks (Bill Paxton), and we are afforded a shot of Ripley looking on in horror at her escorts.<br/><br/>When the time comes, of course the film breaks out into action - armed soldiers versus a nest of beasts when it's discovered a process similar to what befell John Hurt in ""Alien"" occurred to an unwitting inhabitant of the colony. But, without question, the film is more than merely two hours of blazing guns and wretched shootouts - there is variety to the set pieces and they're executed really well: pulsating gunfights in rooms drowned in red light give way to retreats into ventilation shafts; there is a dramatic confrontation in the cargo bay of a giant spaceship, which refuses to end when it spills into the airlock. Midway through, Ripley is trapped in a small bunkroom with a crawling specimen eager to attach itself to her face where every little rattle and clank is unnerving. What additionally struck me was just how difficult it was to predict who was safe and who wasn't.<br/><br/>Moreover, the film is a poised character study of Ripley negating this new nightmare with an infant girl called Newt (Carrie Henn), orphaned by the monsters, and allowing Weaver's character a kind of second chance at good mothering. She may have failed to live up to the promise she made to the daughter we find out about, but damned if she's going to fail to get Newt out of this jam. The arc is eventually afforded closure as Ripley and an alien queen, responsible for the eggs from which the aliens essentially harbour their existences, confront one another and we remember it was one of the queen's own offspring which ultimately took Ripley's time with her own little girl away from her. ""Aliens"" is a taut, well-made sequel and well worth seeing."
"KoolCatReviews","9","1","2","6 April 2020"," If its war you want, you will get it
","Taking the original alien story forward by adding tons of action might not have been the best way for the series moving forward but this entry is good. It is quite similar to other 80s movies at the time drawing heavy inspiration from the veitnam war. With biggest different being with the female lead. There might be lots of macho army guys in this movie but none are as good as Ripley. The plot in this movie works with a few twists and turns that original didn't have. You get great effects and CGI the same as the first movie. The best part about this movie is you get to see alot more of the 'alien' universe. I would recommend watching the extended addition and there is some extra footage that is worth watching. If you want that classic Sci-fi horror blend that is now action heavy, you will enjoy this."

It is at its best when it brings in the suspense elements that the series so desperately needs, but it always keeps a keen focus on the horrific nature of its eponymous creatures even though their impact is severely diluted this time around.

","I had high expectations coming into this movie mainly due to its high rating and the users' reviews that I saw were praising this movie as the best ever in sci-fi genre. Well... it was and entertaining movie to watch, fun and enjoyable but with some serious issues which I'll be tackling down bellow:<br/><br/>1. The science: This movie just like 99% of the all sci-fi movies wants you to believe that artificial gravity can exist in a spacecraft no matter how the spacecraft is or how it moves. Take for instance Interstellar(best sci-fi in my opinion) that tackles this notion and many more to be a complete package that doesn't have the old film school's clichés about gravity in a spacecraft nor the extravagant sound in space where there's no air to conduct the sound waves like it is in this movie. Also releasing a shuttle while orbiting a planet makes the shuttle fall like it's only a couple of miles from the ground.<br/><br/>2. Little to no explanation on who are these creatures, what do they want or how are they able to grow in sooo many numbers as depicted in the film so that the soldiers might have something to kill.<br/><br/>3. The aliens motives were always changing. For example at the beginning we see one killing the crew of a shuttle in order for the shuttle to not reach Ripley and the soldiers also dying(the alien) in the process, while at the end because it implies Newt(somewhat Ripley's daughter) the Alien kidnaps her and tries to make her a host for a new xenomorph. What's the logic here? Do they have intellect in order to assume which people is worthy of dying and who is worthy of being a host? The movie never tackles that and since I don't understand their motives I'm gonna call it a sin(see Cinema sins). <br/><br/>4. There isn't a Alien movie without a robot/droid dying. Here somehow the alien queen or whatever that alien creature was ties itself to the shuttle Bishop was flying at the end although we clearly don't see any sign of it on the shuttle(and yes there's a clear shot of the shuttle in full flight in which the craft looks clean, no alien tied up) but surely we don't want to show it to the audience to ruin the surprise from later on when the queen breaks Bishop in half.<br/><br/>5. In the end just to create more tension in the film we see this: Ripley opens the outside door from that pit she, her mechanical costume and the alien have fallen into, but then after the alien falls into the outside void why in God's name doesn't she closes the outside door with the same switch she used to open the door and to which she was next to on those stairs. Instead she has to climb all the way up to the platform on which the shuttle landed and close the outside door with a switch that's next to the inside door. The movie never tackled that thing on why she couldn't close the outside door with the switch she initially used to open it and why she had to climb all the way to the platform and close it from there. I just started laughing when I saw this much stupidity, but of course that's what a James Cameron movie has sometimes(see T2: Judgment Day).<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the positives but most of them have been already written on so many favorable reviews this movie got, so to sum this up: This is a fun movie with excellent action, great characters, good music and awesome special effects. But for me that isn't enough if your story is filled with drag moments only there to fill the runtime or create unnecessary new twists and turns or suspense. It's an 8 from me for this entertaining but flawed movie."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","2","8 April 2017"," The action horror film
","Each of the four Alien films has their own distinct and noticeable personalities. Ridley Scott's original creeping horror show is a tense, streamlined, gracefully vicious film that slinks along at its own pace, not unlike the resident feline Jonesy who wondered about on the spaceship Nostromo back then. If Alien has the qualities of a cat, James Cameron's Aliens has those of a rambunctious puppy dog, a rip snortin, go get em action backyard barbecue knockout that runs up and gives the audience a big wet slimy kiss. All animal metaphors aside (I'm running out of oh-so-clever ways to open my reviews, OK? Been at this for two years now), Cameron's film is an undisputed classic, still jaw dropping to this day, even after what feels like hundreds of viewings, nostalgic yet fresh in different ways every time, and simply one of the best films ever made. It's the gold standard for creature feature sci fi too, and while many argue whether or not it in fact outdid Scott's original white knuckler, I can't bring myself to be petty and pick favourites out of the quadrilogy, I love them all for a whole bunch of reasons. Aliens picks up quite a while after the catastrophic events of the first, with Ripley floating around in that cryo-pod for way too long, until she happens to cruise past earth, crossing the vision of the Weyland/Yutani corporation once again. Because they always make astute, well thought out choices, they decide to send a research team, accompanied by a very reluctant Ripley and a group of hoo-rah, bull in a China shop colonial marines to far off industrial exomoon LV-426, where they have lost communication with the settlers. After a brief, clammy build up, all hell breaks loose, and we get to see the full impressive extent of Cameron's skill as a visual storyteller, as well as the oh-so-gooey, inspired practical effects work that brings those gorgeous Xenomorph beauties to snarling life. The cast is the epitome of badass, as we are constantly reminded of by Bill Paxton's Hudson, the film's resident squirrel who gets hilariously skittish when things get dicey (""game over, man!"" Will never not out a big, Paxton sized grin on my face), but who heroically holds his own once he gets his sillies out. The other side of that coin is Corporal Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn, never slicker), cool as ice, shaken by nothing, including an atmosphere entry landing that would make Alfonso Cuaron pee himself, but doesn't come close to disturbing Hick's afternoon nap. Every Alien team must have an artificial human, some of which are trustworthy, and some not. Lance Henriksen's Bishop is as solid as they come, never losing his head (despite being reduced to a puddle of spilt dairy product) and sticking by Ripley's side until the bitter, hectic end. Ripley herself is a little older, a little wiser and a lot tougher, her intensity calcified into grit after losing her daughter, and given somewhat of a surrogate in the form of Newt (Carrie Henn) an orphaned child who has survived months living like a rodent in the air ducts. ""They mostly come at night... mostly"" she eerily warns Ripley. Oh boy, do they ever. LV-426 is positively teeming with them, and they show up to provide speaker shattering, pixel scattering action like only Cameron can do. The facehugger in the room sequence is still one of the most terrifying sequences in any film, and serves to make you hate Weyland weasel Burke (Paul Reiser) with that deep loathing reserved for the scummiest traitors in film. The final thirty minutes of the film are a showcase of action cinema, and it's amazing to think they pulled off the Queen fight without any cgi back then, a slam-bang marvel of a climax that fires on a thousand cylinders, and to this day has never been topped. That goes for the film too. It's *the* action sci-fi film, and as close to perfection as you can get."
"patomartinezfgo","9","1","2","18 March 2017"," One of the greatest action movies, still not better than the original
","""Aliens"" is the sequel to ""Alien"" and this time we get to see Ellen Ripley helping some soldiers in their quest of finding what happened in a mysterious planet.<br/><br/>This movie is very different from the original because it concentrates more on action than on survival horror. Still, the aliens and face-huggers give you a fright every time they appear on-screen. The movie is able to maintain the feel and look of the original even thought Ridley Scott didn't come back as a director.<br/><br/>In this case, James Cameron directed the film and his talent really shines. You can tell how he decided to use certain shots to tell the audience things without us having to literally see it. He chooses to show rather than tell which is always much more entertaining.<br/><br/>Of course the first movie had its limitations concerning budget and effects at the time so the alien wasn't really seen. In this movie, James Cameron had the opportunity to show their aliens in their full glory; but interestingly, the best parts of the movie are when he chooses not to do this and tries to only show bits of the Xenomorph or show us what they are doing without showing us the creature. This is because it captures a sense of suspense and mystery that will otherwise not be there. When James Cameron chooses to show the aliens completely is when (in my opinion) you lose some of the tension and start seeing this as more of an action movie than a horror movie."
"tkell31","10","1","2","28 February 2017"," Thanks for Hudson
","With Bill Paxton's passing I was prompted to re-watch aliens and can not believe how he turned a secondary character into a industry setting standard for one liners. Almost every single line he delivered was fantastic, memorable and quotable from his bantering with Vazquez to his honest and accurate assessment of the situations they found themselves in. I really believe you could replace any other character in the movie, but his portrayal of Hudson was so unique it made the movie. Well certainly did for me and my friends when we watched it countless times back in our college years. Thanks for the memories."
"Cameronius_113","9","1","2","7 January 2017"," Bigger and better
","NOTE: I watched the Special Edition of the film, what the creators believe to be the true version of it, so there may be things I talk about in this review that aren't featured in the original cut. This film did indeed surprise me. I definitely was expecting it to be great but when I finished it I was quite surprised to believe that I actually liked this one more than the first which was something I wasn't expecting. This is one of the rare instances where the sequel is nearly as good as/as good as/better than it's predecessor and the amount of effort put into the film was impressive. This could've easily been a cash-grab film but the amount of effort put in shows how much respect James Cameron had for the source material and also how much the actors cared about it and wanted to make a worthy sequel and their enthusiasm for the project definitely added up to it being an amazing film along with all the other great things about it. Something I love about this film is that it is very different to the first and offers a completely new experience rather than just revisiting plot elements of the original again. As well as being refreshingly different, it expanded on knowledge we learnt in the first much more too. Ripley's character was developed much more in this film and her inner struggles were shown too which made for a more complex and realistic character. For those of you who don't know, the Special Edition of this film is the original cut as the one that ended up in cinemas was a trimmed down version as people weren't expected to sit through 2 and a half hours. One of the parts cut from the cinema release was a background about Ripley's daughter who she obviously didn't spend much time with due to her cryogenic sleep and her sadness over this event added much more to her character and also something else I'll get onto in a minute. I thought that Ripley's relationship with the young girl Newt was great and had much more of an impact in the Special Edition; as I mentioned a minute ago, in the Special Edition we find out about Ripley's sadness of not being able to see her daughter which makes her basically treat Newt like the daughter she wish she still had which added much more of an emotional connection to it and I'm surprised that the daughter sub-plot was originally cut. All of the side-characters each added something to the story and their chemistry with each other made them feel like real people too. Their characters were well-written just like Ripley's crew in the original and you felt a sense of danger when they were in sticky situations. Something the movie did very well was keeping the tense atmosphere of the original while adding much more to it like great action and great sets. The practical effects are fantastic, especially for the time. The quality of them help capture a sense of realism to it too and really makes it feel like these characters are somewhere that actually exists. Overall, I thought this was an amazing film and I have nothing but praise for it. My basic overview of the film is that it incorporates many similar elements to the original, expanding them to a much bigger spectacle while adding much more too and this is why I prefer it to the original. As I said earlier, these two films both offer different experiences, this one being an action film and the first being a thriller. It probably depends which genre you prefer to determine which movie you prefer but either way I would still highly recommend this film. 8.7/10"
"davidlybaert","10","1","2","14 July 2016"," The definition of space action-horror
","This is a reference for so many other movies, and still my all-time favourite next to the first one. <br/><br/>James Cameron re-invents space sci-fi right here, apparently he didn't go for expensive state of the art (at the time) special effects for this movie either. He accomplishes the thrill by very fast moving scenes when the aliens are present; obviously the suspense and thrill from the creature(s) is set-up by Ridley Scott and the design of H.R. Giger. But what Cameron does with it is awesome and inspired the future of space action-horror for many other artists, developers and cineasts.<br/><br/>The only thing I would advise for watching this movie is watching the first one before this, the tension will be so much higher if you have a background on the most important cast member(s)."
"saymaraza","8","1","2","5 June 2016"," Aliens review
","Aliens is the sequel to the 1979 Ridley Scott film 'Alien' I wouldn't say this film was quite as good as the original 'Alien' but it still definitely worth a watch. It follows on well, set the same amount of years since the first one came out. (7 years) This film is Directed by James Cameron (The Terminator, Titanic) and stars Sigourney Weaver again as Ellen Ripley, with supporting cast of Michael Biehn (The Terminator) Bill Paxton (Titanic) Lance Hnerikson (The Terminator) All James Cameron films. James Cameron has the same sort of style to his movies, and it seems that he likes to work with the same sort of people. For example, Arnold Schwarzeneggar (The Terminator, Terminator 2, True Lies) All James Cameron pictures. Michael Biehn (The Terminator, Terminator 2 (uncredited) Aliens) All James Cameron pictures. And Bill Paxton (The Terminator, True Lies, Aliens, Titanic) All James Cameron. Aliens is a great sequel to Alien, and is thought to be just as good as the first Alien movie. In my opinion, i prefer the first Alien just a little bit more. I like it more because of the creepy build up. When they find the egg and we don't know what's going to happen as it's the first time you see the Alien, In this film we've already seen the Aliens, so we know what to expect. The only downfall of the film i'd say is that it was a little rushed, the Aliens came in too soon, and there were loads of them. In the first film, the Alien was really hard to kill (impossible to kill) in this film, they were killing off the Aliens as if it was as easy as stepping on an ant. I think Ridley Scott thought that through really well with Alien, and made it a lot more darker than the sequel. Even though James Cameron's Aliens was still very dark in it's own way, But my favourite of his work definitely still stands as the original Terminator (1984)"
"PredragReviews","9","1","2","30 April 2016"," Let's Rock!
","This film is simply full on action from the man behind ""The Terminator"" and ""True Lies"". Uncomparable to Alien as they are completely different. The first builds tension and is more of a horror film where as this is just a massive bullet fest. Sheer class. It has that classic Cameron action sequences and special effects, but also a frantic and claustrophobic atmosphere. The music is one of the best scores ever recorded for a movie and adds tension as the soldiers fight for their lives in a situation that they cannot hope to win.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is simply phenomenal throughout - her passionate relationship with Newt is moving, especially when Ripley goes back in against the odds in a vengeful fury to rescue the little girl from the hive. Throughout you really connect with Sigourney's lead character who is really fleshed out further in this sequel. To have seen the first ""Alien"" film is recommended before watching this film. Aliens exemplifies the strengths of women and experience. Ultimately it's not about creatures from other planets, bad guys, big guns. It's about the love between a mother and child. All in all, this is a must have for any Sci-Fi or action fan, but make sure to watch the original film first as it will give this one an added dimension.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."
"The Grand Master","9","1","2","6 March 2016"," If Alien scared you out of your seats, Aliens goes one better and blows you out of your seats.
","Aliens was an excellent sequel to a brilliant movie that has certainly gone one better, awesome non-stop edge-of your-seat action, a great cast, and a quality director. What more could you ask for in a movie? Ridley's Scott's Alien (1979) is still a timeless atmospheric science fiction-horror classic and while Alien scared you out of your seat, Aliens blew you out of your seat. Instead of rehashing the original storyline, James Cameron brilliantly and intelligently expands on the original storyline and adds more of the titular Aliens, more firepower, explosions, grunt, testosterone, and establishing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley as one of the finest female heroines in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Set 57 years after the original, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver)is found after drifting through space after sleeping in cryogenic stasis following her ordeal on the ship Nostromo in which she was the sole survivor after battling an Alien which found its way on board and killed the rest of the crew. Her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation are dismissive of her claims that an Alien killed the ship's crew and forced her to destroy the ship and as a result, her flight officer's license is suspended. When contact is lost on a colony on LV-426 a Weyland-Yutani executive Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and US Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope) ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a US Colonial Marine platoon to investigate the disturbance. After much reluctance and reoccurring nightmares, Ripley agrees, but only to destroy the aliens. The USCM platoon is made up of such members as the respected platoon Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews), Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) Private Drake (Mark Rolston) and many others. Also accompanying Ripley, Burke and the Colonial Marines is Bishop (Lance Henriksen) was the android executive officer of the USS Sulaco and unlike the traitorous and deceitful Ash from the first movie Bishop is friendly and loyal to the crew especially Ripley despite her fearful suspicions at first. The mission goes horrible wrong when the Aliens are awakened and despite the Marines' firepower a majority of them are killed leaving a handful remaining to fight for survival on an unfamiliar planet in unfamiliar territory. Rebecca ""Newt"" (Carrie Henn) was the only survivor amongst the colonists of LV-426 and Ripley takes Newt under her wing and the Marines vow to protect her while awaiting rescue.<br/><br/>James Cameron has brilliantly and intelligently done an amazing job with Aliens. After exploding onto the scene with Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Terminator (1984) James Cameron further establishes his credentials with Aliens. It's not that often you see a claustrophobic and atmospheric science fiction-horror movie followed up with an all out science fiction-action movie that sets the trend for all movies on how to follow up with a sequel that outshines the original.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as the strong willed Ripley who must overcome her fears from the events of the first movie and she does so by overcoming her fears to fight to survive and shows that when pushed she is a determined and strong willed woman that will fight back.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also top notch. Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein, Lance Henriksen, Mark Rolston and a special mention goes to Carrie Henn who plays the precocious but resourceful Newt who has managed to survive and stay calm even as some of the Colonial Marines have cracked under a great deal of stress. This was Carrie Henn's sole movie appearance, who later became a school teacher and decided not to pursue a movie career.<br/><br/>Alien 3 (1992) and Alien: Resurrection (1997) failed to reach the benchmark set by Aliens, having suffered the fate of the sequels that have failed to reach the expectations of audiences.<br/><br/>30 years on, Aliens is still a favourite amongst all audiences. Not just as a science fiction movie but as an action movie as well. The cast is top notch, the story is enthralling and engaging from start to finish, and the action keeps the movie crackling along at a fast pace. James Cameron's brilliant direction made this possible as a movie that has gone one better from the original.<br/><br/>9/10."
"InaneSwine","10","1","2","18 February 2016"," The best sequel I've ever seen
","Aliens had a powerful build-up to its release. In 1979, Alien terrified audiences and is now hailed - rightly so - as one of the most important sci-fi and horror films of all time. Subsequently, in 1984, James Cameron released his powerful debut The Terminator. (If you discount his true debut, Piranha II. Eek.) While Alien proved how terrifying sci-fi can be, Terminator proved the same - but also how emotional it can be too. Aliens builds on the legacy of both its predecessor, and Cameron's own predecessor. He expertly explores the emotional back-stories of the characters that we just weren't given the time to do in Alien. But he doesn't forget what the sci-fi buffs and the horror fans want - plenty of action, plenty of screams and a grand spectacle. Aliens is, quite simply, the best sequel I've ever seen."
"Cdn1234","10","1","2","3 February 2016"," No better movie than this!
","It's not the Aliens that make this movie, it's Ripley. Her intent to defeat not only the Company, the Aliens or her fear, but to save Newt. Her determination. Her strength. The constant stress that anyone can relate to. It's her humanity and her strength that carry this movie along. The addition of the Queen is a master stroke. Kudos Mr Cameron! And to the special effects that still hold up 30 years later. I get goose-bumps every time I watch this and I've seen it probably 100 times! It's a movie that is best seen in the Blu-ray format (that fixes a few mistakes) and with a surround sound system to bring out the nuances in the sound effects. An excellent continuation of the story from Alien. Hands down, my favorite movie of all time!"
"Sandcooler","9","1","2","5 January 2016"," The perfect horror-action blend
","While the original ""Alien"" certainly got under my skin more with its claustrophobic shots, I would say ""Aliens"" is at least equally entertaining. What I like most about James Cameron's action movies is that he never looks down on the genre. It's not because he makes action that the movie shouldn't feature well thought-out dialogues, a coherent story and actual characters, quite to the contrary: there's no point in doing awful things to your protagonists if we don't care about them in the first place. The first act is purely about getting to know the characters, that way it actually has some dramatic value when they inevitably get killed. The action itself looks amazing as well, it's incredible what you can do with practical effects if you don't have CGI to bail you out. The alien queen was so huge it needed fourteen crew members to make it move realistically, but the upside to that: it moves realistically, not pixel by pixel. I miss that charm in modern day action movies, but thankfully a movie like ""Aliens"" is infinitely rewatchable."

My opinion is that this is one of few examples where the sequel is better then the original. And Alien was also excellent. <br/><br/>Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the only one who survived the encounter with the deadly alien in Alien - the eighth passenger '. In the sequel 'Aliens' Ripley is back to the planet where she first met the monsters. Here she discovers that the beast is alive and well and has offspring too. The offspring are at least as dangerous as the original monster, and Ripley have to really take control and lead the battle once again, to fight back and try to survive the vicious attack. This time with soldiers and one child, a surviver they find on the planet.<br/><br/>The brilliant Sigourney Weaver takes on the monsters in a breathtaking speed and with a determination that will keep Your attention during the film.<br/><br/>The haunting and battle scenes are amazing, and the struggle to defeat the monsters are the most exciting in the film. But the casting are also very good. I think the storyline and casting of this film, is stronger and better than in the sequels that followed.<br/><br/>This is really creepy, and so well done.

","I watched the ""Director's Cut"" once or twice before. As much as I love the additional scenes in all of James Cameron's ""Special Editions"", when I saw it before I thought the added scene with Newt's family diminished from the effect of meeting Newt later. This time I thought it was actually even better: Meeting Newt as a ""regular girl"" first and then seeing her transformation, actually adds a layer to her character. I really liked the way she acted and thought it was a great combination of casting, acting and direction. Not that her screamings weren't annoying at times, but all in all, I think she was excellent in her role and more believable than many other kids I saw in movies.<br/><br/>James Horner's score is excellent.<br/><br/>BTW, did you notice that when they discuss Bishop, they mention that the android from the first movie was made by Cyberdine?<br/><br/>Last time I gave it a 8/10.

"sandnair87","9","1","2","24 August 2015"," James Cameron's Unmistakable Mastery Makes 'Aliens' a Consummate Fright-Fest!
","'Aliens', the sequel to Ridley Scott's eerie space thriller, is a high-tech, souped-up war movie - a rare instance where a follow-up deviates from the formula and finds an effective rhythm in propelling the story.<br/><br/>Having overcome a terrifying alien predator, Ripley (a fantastic Sigourney Weaver in her best performance of the series) is found drifting through space in a life-pod by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station, where Burke, a representative of The Company, tells her that she has been unconscious for 57 years. To her horror, Ripley also learns that the planet on which she and her crew found the creature in 'Alien' has been colonized. It isn't long, however, until Burke tells her that they've lost contact with the colony (a series of scenes involving those colonists confronting a mysterious spacecraft shows us that Ripley's worst fears are realized: the alien life forms have reappeared) and asks her to accompany a platoon of colonial marines to the planet as an adviser. She's sent in with a crack squad of marines and hurtles headlong into a hi-tech house of horrors that delivers plenty of shocks and nail-biting suspense.<br/><br/>Once the marines land, the film becomes a feast of fights and special effects, from the high-tech weaponry of the marines to the aliens themselves. But 'Aliens' wisely never allows its admittedly eye-catching and inventive gizmos to control the film. Rather, they provide striking punctuation! It's almost all suspense-building, as it expertly draws out the audience's mounting anxiety. For well over two hours, the audience sits transfixed in a web of despair, and around every corner there exists a bleak reality that never lets up, even in brief moments where an upper hand seems within reach. Consider this: The first full-grown alien does not appear until after the one-hour mark as the full figure of the alien eludes full photographic exposure during many of the confrontations, and that only adds to the adrenaline. We may know what it looks like based on past experience, but who is to say they have not evolved.<br/><br/>James Cameron's sense of precision allows the movie to make distinctive departures from its predecessor. Ridley Scott was the right director to make a movie as cautious and observing as 'Alien', but it took a man with great nerve to concoct a follow-up that could amp up the adrenaline beyond simple passages of action. Masterfully controlling the tension and moving the involving plot at a lightning pace, Cameron exploits everyone's worst fears and carries them to the riveting extreme in this consummate fright-fest. Where most horror films goose the gore quotient to elicit excitement from audiences, the visceral nature of Aliens is tempered so as not to override the main thrust of the story.<br/><br/>Thanks to him, Aliens proves to be a tightly constructed yarn that has no problem keeping its audience's attention rapt. It is visceral entertainment!"

","Aliens was in many ways a significant change in tone of the franchise. Whilst there was still an element of fear to the aliens the focus went from a horror to a full on action. It was a risky move and could have felt like they were ruining the franchise. Luckily it never felt like that. Instead it feels like a natural progression. It brings back what we loved about Alien without rehashing ideas, whilst significantly expanding on the universe and making it an even more lovable franchise than it previously was. <br/><br/>After struggling to get over the fear of the Xenomorph attack in the last film, Ridley joins a crew of space marines who are going to the planet the Xenomorphs were found to investigate the lack of communication with the colony who have been placed there. Of course the Xenomorphs have attacked and it turns to a fight for survival as Ridley and the Marines begin a desperate fight to escape the planet. <br/><br/>What makes this film extremely powerful is that it doesn't go straight to the action. A great deal of the films first half is devoted to the marines. It lets us know them. More than that it shows them as real bad-asses, like super soldiers. They have these massive plasma weapons and flamethrowers. Some have cocky attitudes treating the threat of the Xenomorph like it was nothing. <br/><br/>But then the Xenomorphs strike. The moment when they strike the numbers quickly begin to dwindle and it happens so quickly there's even difficulty in tracking just how many have died. The super tough soldiers have been cut down into these victims, beginning to break down and panic that they're going to die. Through this Cameron maintains the legacy of Scott's Alien. He ensures that the Xenomorphs appear just as powerful and imposing as they've ever been. It gives us the immediate assurance that this is still a survival film. The Xenomorphs are still the hunters. And we are still the hunted. <br/><br/>Surprisingly Sigourey Weavers portrayal of Ripley actually improves in this film from the already incredible character she played in the first. She goes from a hardened survivor to a fully fledged hero. The change isn't sudden, but as she begins to undertake the responsibility as the film goes on. On top of this side stories such as caring for a child named Newt (the last surviving colonist) keep the character extremely grounded and human. To this day she remains one of the most powerful female figures in film because of how kick ass she can be. <br/><br/>Then there's James Cameron, who seems to truly be in his element with sci-fi. The studio even waited a while for him to finish his work on Terminator just so he could do the film, which was without a doubt a great choice. Watching films like Terminator and Aliens is like watching a piece of dynamite with a lit fuse. He makes us enjoy the tension of waiting for the action to happen. Then when it blows it's fast and keeps us gripped to the screen. He makes seeing a Xenomorph explode just about as exciting as you can and yet still maintains their presence as threatening figures. <br/><br/>Aliens completely changes the original story of the previous film. In the first then it was based around a threat that was unknown. But now the threat is known and it's time to fight back. But at the same time it never loses sight on the fact that the marines are still the hunted here. It's a fight for survival and one that we want to keep watching."

","Aliens is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great cast.The movie is a sequel to Alien and with it being released seven years after the first it was very anticipated,so it wasn't an easy task for James Cameron to try and make a sequel that is just as good as Ridley Scott's film,but Cameron did an outstanding job and I think,and I'm sure many people will agree,that this movie is even better.It is more intense and exciting than Alien,its much more fast paced and action packed,the previous movie can be very slow at times but this movie really keeps you at the edge of your seat all the way through.Sigourney Weaver is outstanding as usual,she was great in the original but I think she has improved and matured even more as an actor within the seven years.Aliens is both action packed and terrifying,I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great action or sci-fi. <br/><br/>Ripley leads a force to the planet where she first faced the alien,only to find a whole colony.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Sigourney Weaver Worst Performance: Paul Reiser"
"Samtheshrikker","9","1","2","5 August 2014"," A masterpiece in science fiction...
","Aliens is simply a masterpiece. Every aspect of this film is meticulously crafted to create a single, mesmerising production that will stay with you long after you watch it.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver steps back up to the plate as Ellen Ripley, the only survivor of the events of Alien. Weaver's performance is incredible and her iron-willed, determined presence means that in many ways Ripley becomes the film's main anchor. Carrie Henn keeps up with Weaver in playing ""Newt"", and the difficulty of her role as a traumatised child is credit to the performance she gives. The supporting cast remain on the ball throughout, though it has to be said that Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen put in a particularly terrific shift. Fans of the original will easily see that James Cameron took a more action- orientated direction, as opposed to the pure horror aspect of Alien. Cameron's guidance throughout is that of a pure talent, especially during the careful build up to the movie's climax. The pace is superb, and while it isn't saturated with action, the scenes that do contain it pack an almighty punch. Similarly, the sets are splendid and really have become synonymous with science fiction; the darkness of the corridors and the claustrophobic, stuffy rooms add to the sheer desperation and struggle that defines the film's second half. The music is hauntingly gorgeous, and the special effects don't disappoint. Even the props used were magical, as some of the film's most memorable scenes come from the heart-stopping motion trackers. Literally, my only problem with Aliens is the final ten/fifteen minutes. It doesn't ruin the film at all, but it just seemed a little silly and unbelievable (seriously though, it's only minor).<br/><br/>Aliens is very hard to fault because it's just that good. The cast make their characters both likable and memorable, the sets are superb and the plot is solid (helped by the immaculate script). You don't need to have seen the original, but many prefer the sequel anyway, which arguably cements this picture as a masterpiece in science fiction... and cinema in general."
"samorchard96","9","1","2","18 July 2014"," ""Game NOT over man!""
","This is one of the best films I've ever seen, sci-fi or otherwise. It's nigh-on perfect, and on a par with the original 'Alien', which in itself was an amazing film. Whilst the Ridley Scott original was tense, paced horror with a sense of dread and isolation, this is all-guns blazing action yet with those same senses. It is very well directed and crafted - every character is made to feel real and evokes reaction, from Ripley to the Marines, every twist and turn is shocking to the viewer, and the Aliens themselves are, very cleverly, not overused, except perhaps for the (spoiler) Queen who faces off against Ripley right at the end, but again in a satisfying and very brutal encounter. Aliens could easily stand on its own, let alone as a sequel, and serves as a fast paced, thrilling action film that is sure to be remembered long into the night..."
"dwpollar","8","1","2","6 July 2014"," Very good sci-fi action movie...
","1st watched 7/3/2014 -- 8 out of 10(Dir-James Cameron): Very good sci-fi action movie in this second film starring the perfect alien life form created in the original 1979 movie. This movie doesn't try to imitate the original but just makes a good fast moving scary film that gives us more information about the creatures and introduces us to the big mama who is making all the eggs. It starts with Ripley, played again by Sigourney Weaver, and her cat being picked up by a salvage team after flying around for 56 years in space. When she shares her encounter about the Alien species it's initially dismissed, but when they are unable to contact a group of residents living on the planet where the alien ship was first found -- she's asked to join a bunch of marines on a trip to the planet. There are some homages to the original including the initial title screen, and the scene where the crew wakes up from their longtime slumber, but Cameron definitely has his own way of doing things. He doesn't take too long to turn the movie into action fare, but does also a good job of establishing Ripley's motherly instincts that helps us understand her motivation to kick ass later. Newt, a small child lone survivor, becomes kind of Ripley's adopted child since her real child is already deceased. There are a couple of silly dialogued scenes and some unintentional humor brought out from Bill Paxton's character because he is so caricatured, but other than this the movie is well done. Some of the broadly drawn typecast characters are a negative, but Michael Biehn's characters provides a combat person with a heart which is nice to see. Paul Reiser, plays the nice guys who turns bad and we wish it wouldn't happen, but it does. As an action alien movie it would be hard to get much better than this one...so dismiss the character imperfections --- enjoy this, and wait for the next one!!"
"Rainey-Dawn","8","1","2","30 June 2014"," Terrorizing Action
","""Aliens"" is an action-packed movie and not a bad sequel to the first film. This one has Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) as a gun-toting female ""Rambo"" who is bound and determined to get rid of all of these particular species of aliens that tends to terrorize all that come into contact with them.<br/><br/>I actually prefer the first film of the series ""Alien"" because it is less action and more suspense but the sequel ""Aliens"" is quite entertaining. I found the idea of horror changed between the two films. The first one, ""Alien"", the horror lies in the element of the unknown then facing it. Whereas the second movie the horror lies more in the action, the idea of facing death and the death of others. -- Just an opinion.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Wuchakk","9","1","2","16 June 2014"," One of the best monster movies
","I prefer James Cameron's ""Aliens"" (1986) to its predecessor, Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" (1979), mainly because the story is more compelling. People often say ""Aliens"" is more of an action film than ""Alien,"" but it's not a mindless action film and, in fact, the action doesn't even start until a FULL HOUR into its 2 hour and 18 minutes runtime (the extended cut runs about 16 minutes longer). The best horror/action movies take this route -- taking their time to build character and suspense before unleashing the horrific mayhem.<br/><br/>Some complain about the screaming little girl, Newt, but -- hey -- she's a little girl and I think the situation calls for this sort of response. Others complain that Bill Paxton is too whiny as one of the Marines, but isn't this the way SOME people respond when facing overwhelming defeat -- even hardened militarists -- particularly by hideous extraterrestrial monsters? Another complaint is that the Marines are depicted as dumb, arrogant ""oo-rah"" types, but I used to be a Marine and this was the way the over-the-top ones acted and, furthermore, these are the kinds of Marines that would qualify for such a dangerous mission -- the (over)confident wackjobs who would get the job done and done right.<br/><br/>The initial confrontation with the aliens at the hour mark is one of the most horrific sequences in cinematic history; and the Marines are thoroughly humbled. The rest of the film shows the surviving group literally sweating-it-out trying to figure out how to get off the planet alive where annihilating the creatures becomes a secondary objective.<br/><br/>Ripley's motherly love for Newt is a good addition and it humanizes Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). The sequences with the alien Queen make for a dynamic and extended climax. Also, Lance Henriksen is notable as the ""artificial human"" and Paul Reiser as an effective love-to-hate quasi-villain.<br/><br/>On the downside, the film is noticeably setbound, but that's par for the course for these types of sci-fi films, e.g. Star Trek. Another negative -- for me at least -- is that the film features no curvy babes, but this was the case with the first film as well, so it's to be expected. Besides, I think the female crew is more believable without someone like Juno Temple or Megan Fox aboard, lol.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that ""Aliens"" is easily one of the greatest monster films of all time, surpassing even the first film in the series and leagues better than the next two.<br/><br/>GRADE: A"
"reptileguy321","10","1","2","19 May 2014"," My favorite film of all time.
","James Cameron truly understands how to make an incredible film. In Aliens the creatures are great, but it's really all about the characters. Every single character in the film is memorable and very quotable. I consider the best performance in the film to be Bill Paxton's character Hudson. He provides the perfect amount of comic relief when it's most necessary and he is probably the best part of the film. I originally watched this movie when I was six and from that point on I've had a love for film. Essentially, if you haven't seen this film, you need to see it. I've never been inspired by a film so much in my life. Aliens is by far the best horror-science fiction movie to ever hit the big screen, and I'll be surprised if anything ever surpasses it. I consider Aliens to be the closest thing to a perfect movie in film history. It's straight up awesome."

","Every scifi fan should watch this film and so should most people who wouldn't class themselves as one. A bold statement for sure but one that I think the film justifies. Aliens has everything a good film should have:-<br/><br/>The script is sharp. Dialogue is realistic and clichÃ©s are avoided.<br/><br/>Acting is first rate with superb performances from the whole cast. Ellen Ripley is something we don't see very often - a female lead with a character that any actress would give their right arm to play. Sigourney Weaver plays it to perfection.<br/><br/>The direction moves the film on at a pace and despite the long running time you certainly don't feel like anything is being dragged out.<br/><br/>The special effects are absolutely awesome. CGI effects producers of today take note as to how to do effects properly. At no time do you think ""that effect is shoddy"". It's hard to believe this is 28 years old.<br/><br/>The alien has to be both the best realised and scariest horror creature ever captured on film. There's no ""man in a rubber suit"" here. The alien is both realistic and frightening. Top marks for pulling it off.<br/><br/>There's action by the bucket loads, horror and scifi. It's a thriller and there's even a hint of romantic chemistry there too. It's the film with everything and is one of those rare occasions when the sequel surpasses the original. If you're a scifi fan and haven't seen it then you're missing a film that should easily make most fans top ten lists. It's right at the top of mine."

All the actors played splendidly, I've always been a fan of Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton impressed and amused me with his role of the scared, ironical talking soldier, the girl who played Vasquez was badass as well, top notch really.

"geminiredblue","10","1","2","17 December 2013"," Get Away From Her You...
","In 1979, Ridley Scott's ALIEN invaded the theaters, scaring the pants off of everyone with a highly lethal extraterrestrial. In 1986, James Cameron made this sequel. And what a sequel it is! ALIENS may, in fact, be the best sequel ever! For 57 years, lone survivor Ripley (Weaver) has been floating out in space. Shortly after being rescued, she's asked to go back to the planet where the alien ship was discovered in the first movie. In the 57 years, colonists have settled on the planet and recently went missing. A team of space marines tag along to investigate the disappearance. What they find is truly terrifying! Building upon the original movie's premise, Cameron turns it into an action thriller, with a healthy dose of chills, tough guy theatrics and instantly-quotable one-liners. Ripley's character has been strengthened, now tough as nails and bad-ass. Late in the film, her fight with The Queen is a memorable cinematic battle. Overall, the movies is excellent. My only complaint is with the re-issued SPECIAL EDITION of the film, in which 15 additional minutes were added back in. The extra footage included several unnecessary exposition scenes (one of which introduces Newt way too early). To that version, I give only 9 stars. As for the original cut, it's a classic that deserves 10 stars!"
"GeorgeRoots","10","1","2","12 December 2013"," Oh No Aliens's? ses?
","If you need to read a review to validate a 5* movie of this calibre, then clearly you didn't get this movie or you haven't seen it yet. For shame sir! <br/><br/>James Cameron had the insurmountable challenge to follow up Ridley Scott's epic ""Alien"" (1979), and it was a suicide mission at best. How can you possibly top one of the most tense, scariest atmospheric movies ever depicted at the time? <br/><br/>Well the next best thing works surprisingly well, by taking Sci-Fi's greatest slasher movie and turning it into a mini guerrilla war film. I know that sounds immature, but it so obviously works when it comes to big gun toting, foul-mouthed marines blasting aliens away. Where do you think the 1993 video game classic ""DOOM"", would get its inspiration? AND YET considering its heavy emphasis on all out action, it carries a superb 3 act narrative that constantly becomes stronger & larger. Sigourney Weaver is again superb as ever, fully solidifying Ripley's character and status as Sci-Fi's greatest heroine. And finally, ""Aliens"" introduces us to the colony and size of Sci-Fi's scariest alien race.<br/><br/>On a budget of 18.5 million, THIS is the template movie every action blockbuster EVEN by todays standards should aspire to. It's a solid education, and one of the few sequels that works just as well as a stand alone title.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It doesn't have the nerve shredding fear that the first one so expertly depicted, but ""Aliens"" will challenge you on how far you are willing to go with these soldiers efforts. Considering how bad this franchise eventually got, we'll always have these two staggering titans for decades to come. 10/10."

"JamesMitchell451","10","1","2","21 September 2013"," The best sequel ever created
","For every dozen sequels that aren't as good as their originals, there comes a badass flick like Aliens that not only is as good as alien, but better in every category. The Story of Aliens is that Ripley, still haunted and traumatized after the events of the first film, is asked by her employers: The Weyland- Yutani Corporation to take a squad of colonial marines to destroy a possible Xenomorph infestation there. The performances by everyone in the cast are compelling and memorable, especially from Sigourney Weaver as Ripley who puts on one of, if not the, best performances I have ever seen on film. The sound design is also equally commendable; nothing is quite as memorable to me as the sound of a marine's pulse rifle firing, or the screeching of Xenomorphs. Speaking of Xenomorphs, I love the angle that director James Cameron took with them. We get to see more of the inner workings of their hive, how they think how they fight together, their thought process, how intelligent they can be, and just how dangerous they truly are. The story is kind of familiar (Believe me, the idea of being trapped behind enemy lines isn't exactly new here) but I think that it works to the films advantage. It takes some of those familiar themes and adds a whole new layer to them and makes them fit into the alien universe. Like the previous film it takes the familiar Good vs Evil and adds a whole new dimension to it. A connection of Vietnam can also be made to this film (If you are reading this, please don't start a flame war) I mean think about it: We have over cocky, over confident, marines going into unknown territory to fight an enemy they don't quite understand, and are defeated by the enemy that uses unconventional tactics in battle. James Cameron even said that some of the designs (Weapons, ships, etc.) Were taken from the Vietnam War. The films also takes the uncanny high levels of tension from Alien and cranks it up to a thousand. The dialogue is some of the best in cinematic history, and the characters are great as well. Another thing that must be mentioned, I also really liked the relationship between Newt and Ripley. It is portrayed realistically and adds a whole new dimension to the character of Ellen Ripley. Don't worry, Newt isn't annoying or stupid for a kid. In fact, she is actually really smart and reacts with brains instead of brawn. Hell, she even helps save Ripley at some points. Aliens is a masterpiece. Great writing, special effects, amazing gripping story, good set design, great mood and tone, action, and horror all contribute to this being one of the best film of all time. F**k those that don't like this movie, whether or not Aliens is better than Alien can actually be debated till you're black and blue in the face. But what can't be debated is that Aliens is a not only a masterpiece of science-fiction, but also a masterpiece of cinema."

Sigourney Weaver does such a fine job of reprising her iconic Ellen Ripley role that she got an Oscar nomination for best actress, not something that happens too often for genre films. It may not be as innovative as Scotts' film, but it's still got plenty of atmosphere and tension and keeps your interest even though it's very long for this sort of thing (with the theatrical version running 137 minutes and the special edition coming in even longer at 155 minutes). 30 years later, it maintains its status as one of the most popular and enjoyed films of its type.<br/><br/>The story picks up long after the events of the first ""Alien"" - 57 years, to be exact, as that's how long Ripley has been drifting through space in her escape pod. She finds out that the planet that she and her crew visited so long ago has now been colonized. Ripley is wary of the set-up, and it comes as no surprise to her when all contact is lost with the colony. A squad of Marines is sent there to take care of the problem, with Ripley trying to face her worst fears by tagging along in an advisory capacity. What happened is soon made clear: the colony was overwhelmed by a multitude of monsters of the same variety that she once encountered. These Marines are supposedly total badasses who pack superior firepower, but it remains to be seen if they will prove to be a match for the aliens at all.<br/><br/>First-rate, Oscar winning special effects are just one highlight of an intense movie that does have a lot of set-up to get through, but once it reaches its fever pitch, it's just a hell of a lot of fun. There's one effective set piece after another, although it could be argued that there's at least one climax too many. What does give the story resonance is the motivation behind the character of Ripley, as she morphs from traumatized, haunted individual to an ass kicking female Rambo, determined to save the life of the colony's sole survivor, a little girl (Carrie Henn, memorable in her only film performance). Weaver is wonderful and well supported by a cast full of people who are now very familiar faces, including Cameron regulars Michael Biehn (as the calm and reliable Corporal Hicks), Lance Henriksen (as the helpful android Bishop), and Bill Paxton (as initially cocky and ultimately cowardly Private Hudson). Paul Reiser shows off his dramatic abilities by playing one of the slimiest cinematic corporate villains of all time. Other scene stealers include Al Matthews, Jenette Goldstein, and Mark Rolston.<br/><br/>While it does take a while to get to these scenes, the best ones tend to involve the towering Alien Queen, which is a real sight to behold, particularly as she's created using old school marionette effects when nowadays we all know she'd largely be rendered using CGI.<br/><br/>One solid bit of business is the slight element of mystery when Ripley and the Marines first arrive on the planet. We see the devastation resulting from a horrible battle, and can only imagine what it must have been like.<br/><br/>As good a sequel that could have been made, some fans do appreciate how it goes off on its own path and scores. It's equal parts exciting and suspenseful.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"ernesto-garcia","10","1","2","11 February 2013"," A Genuine Review of Aliens
","Aliens is 1986 science fiction/horror/action sequel directed by James Cameron. So Aliens is widely considered one of the best science fiction films of that period of time and one of the best sequels ever made. Aliens is the story of Ripley and a group of space marines that head to distant planet to investigate strange incidents. Little do the marines know that there are dangerous aliens roaming the buildings around them. The film sacrifices most of it's atmospheric qualities for a far more action packed punch that I personally prefer.I have absolutely no problem with this film,even if I try and knit-pick.I can not think of anyone that will not enjoy this film it is a complete and total masterpiece. 10/10"
"yasenkiranov","9","1","2","30 December 2012"," Different concept than the original-fantastic idea,but hindered by some minor flaws
","One of the main problem of many horror movie franchises is their repetitive nature.Many sequels to horror films,successful enough to spawn them, are usually a rehash of the original with few new ideas.If they decide to take the franchise in a different direction,however,there is a very high chance that it will be an even greater failure(like ""Halloween 3"",for example).<br/><br/>In this regard,Cameron chose the second path and I must say,""Aliens"" is a very well made and entertaining movie.It's a little more action oriented than the original,but that doesn't mean,there aren't suspenseful scenes,either.Unlike the original,Ripley is clearly the protagonist of the film from the very beginning.Her character is further developed and that aspect of the movie was done perfectly.The movie has a higher budget than the first and it is utilized very well.We see more of the aliens and we get more background on them.As I mentioned before,there are more action scenes,which are done very well.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the film,was that at some points it was kinda over-the-top and cheesy.I have seen this in other Cameron films,such as ""Terminator 2:Judgment Day"",but the cheesy moments are a distinct part of ""The Terminator"",but in ""Aliens"" they stick out like a sore thumb.This is most distinct in the scene where the marines awake from cryogenic sleep.I get,that their behavior is supposed to explain to us,that they don't know what they're up against,but I think Cameron went a little too far.<br/><br/>Overall,""Aliens"" is a very well made and entertaining film and while it's not better than the original,it's definitely a worthy sequel."
"user-7630","7","1","2","7 June 2012"," Didn't like it that much
","Now, I'm not a fan of calling movies overrated. And I'm not gonna do that, because I see why people love this film.<br/><br/>I personally didn't enjoy it that much. All the characters besides Ripley aren't very likable, which made it hard for me to care if they got killed or not. I think Cameron knew that, and that's why he introduced Newt. Because everyone cares if a little girl is in danger. Well, for me it was just a cheap trick.<br/><br/>And if I don't care that much about the characters, I can't give it an 8/10.<br/><br/>But now we come to the positive things. The special effects, the designs and visuals are freaking amazing and set new standards for science fiction and action movies. The sets they built looked breathtaking then, and they still look breathtaking now. Computer effects age, real visuals don't. And the alien queen, wow, this must be one of the coolest monsters in movie history.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the original Alien, but I get that this has to be judged differently because it's a different kind of movie. Saying it sucks because it's not like Alien is stupid.<br/><br/>I didn't think the movie as a whole is a masterpiece, because of the problems I had with it. But again, that's just the personal feelings I had. I watched it 3 times, first time as a teen and I hated it. Second time couple of years later, and I just didn't like it. And the third time, I thought it was good. Not great, good. But I get why people love it. I just don't.<br/><br/>7/10"
"LondonCare3","9","1","2","14 February 2012"," Best Action Sci-Fi Film Of All Time
","In my opinion this has to be the best Action Sci-fi film ever made, it is one of my favourite films of all time from any genre.<br/><br/>The film was released in the same year I was born, and I first see the movie at about 9/10 years of age and loved it, and still do. Seeing it and loving from such a young is maybe the reason I prefer it to Alien??? Or it maybe the brilliant characters, action, quotes, story, sound effects, etc - Aliens is the complete thrill ride.<br/><br/>At school around 12/13 years old in English we had to write a story, I basically just told this story, didn't change the characters names or anything (stupid I know) which the teacher picked up on lol.<br/><br/>I loved the game that come out when the first playstation was released too.<br/><br/>This film is easily in my personal top 5 of all time, and is probably the 1 film I can watch over and over through out the year above any other.<br/><br/>Give it a go, and hopefully you will enjoy it as I did.<br/><br/>Game over man, game over!"
"groovyuniverse","7","1","2","21 November 2011"," More more more...but less of what made Alien so great.
","(I'm Dutch and do not speak/write English perfectly, beware!) <br/><br/>Here and now, in 2011, I decided to watch both Alien movies. It was about time since I am 27 now and I love science fiction, but I never took the chance to watch these two movies. I'm not going to review them both of course, but Aliens is such a different movie than Alien is that I have to include my experience with the first movie.<br/><br/>To summarize my night with the first movie: I LOVED it. Some viewers criticize Alien for having a slow pace but i think it is an essential feature of this movie being so effective. There are few scares, but the ones i got truly SCARED and HORRIFIED me. I also love the atmosphere, strengthened by the beautiful music and convincing effects, still holding up after 30 years. There is a loneliness in it all that just sucked me in, sitting alone myself in my room with the lights turned off.<br/><br/>A few days later i started to watch 'Aliens', not knowing what to expect, besides a continuation of the story. Soon i discovered that Aliens is a truly different movie, and the difference in style didn't appeal to me first. Sure, Ripleys' situation is fascinating and the money-hungry CEO's made my empathize with Ripley even more but I really missed the buildup the first movie had. There, I felt isolated like the small crew in the ship, slowly being drawn to the alien horror. In Aliens, this feeling of isolation is largely absent as Ripley starts her second encounter being in contact with groups of people, being at safe distance from the threat.<br/><br/>After an initial scare, the first half of the movie has a pretty slow pace compared to how the movie speeds up eventually. When the movie starts to pick up pace I loved most of the action scenes and after some early annoyance with Newt, I started to love the bond she developed with Ripley and I really wanted them to survive! So for me, the second half of the movie made up for the first half which I felt to be quite dull.<br/><br/>But still, I feel the urge to write about what i consider Aliens' shortcomings because I had higher expectations of this movie. Maybe some of my points of critique arise because i am born in the eighties and raised with bombastic movies like Terminator (2), Robocop, Independence Day, and Starship Troopers. I guess I would have like this movie better if i would have seen it earlier, maybe then i wouldn't have felt the action movie deja vu feeling Aliens gave me.<br/><br/>Deja vu, like the group of Marines. I've seen too many cool Marines on the big screen in my life. Sympathy for them did develop throughout the movie, but their 'badass' attitude made them far less human for me than the crew of the first movie. Talking about 'less human', I hated Burke from the start, it was just too obvious he was a lying weasel. I enjoyed him being killed, too bad the killing scene was too short in comparison with the disgust i felt for him! <br/><br/>After 25 years, Despite my complaints, this is a pretty good movie with a fantastic finale. In retrospect it suffers from the existence of too many roller-coaster ride action movies which came out after 1986. And in this argument lies my appreciation of the first movie, it lacks explosions and bombast but that simplicity feels like a fresh breath of air in a landscape of action/horror movies trying to be bigger than the one before."
"Steffi_P","10","1","2","14 November 2011"," ""Game over man""
","The 80s were really the first era where video games began to influence the look and above all the experience of movies. This trend arguably began with Star Wars in 1977, although barring some flight sequences near the end the possible link is more about the Computer-generated imagery rather than a game-playing experience. But a decade later, just as virtual reality was starting to become a really exciting concept in both science fiction and modern technology, the idea of an action movie being a primarily first person experience was, well not born as such (the idea was hardly new), but certainly enjoyed a surge that made the 80s a golden age for the genre. Aliens features no CGI, just a fabulous mix of prosthetics, miniatures and animatronics, but it captures much of the pace and passion of the video game age.<br/><br/>Director James Cameron puts a real emphasis on closeness, putting the camera right within the melee. When the marines tool up and jog off to the shuttle, the camera tracks along with them as it were one amongst them. Later we see a scene of chaos and carnage through video monitors from the soldiers' personal cameras. Throughout the picture there's continual movement, from which Cameron's remarkable ability to make not very much look exciting and suspenseful. It's all about careful control of the pace. After the marines touch down on the moon, there's a period of inexorable slowness during which Cameron is able to stave off the action scenes for a surprisingly long time, knowing the audience will be enjoying the suspense. And when the actions sequences come, they are no disappointment, a breakneck mix fear and exhilaration.<br/><br/>James Cameron is a rarity among directors, especially in the field of action blockbusters, in that he writes most of the screenplays for his movies, unaided. As such there's always a very tight co-ordination between how characters come alive both visually and verbally. In the scene where everyone is revived for the mission, Cameron has a short amount of time to introduce a half-dozen or so marines. He gives each one a brief close-up and a line or two of memorable dialogue that nails down their personality, or perhaps some little mannerism like Apone putting a cigar in his mouth before he's even sat up. Any more would break the punchy flow of the movie, any less and it would be a bunch of grunts getting picked off with no connection to us. Despite his brevity, Cameron is very precise in his character introductions. Take for example the scene where we see Newt's family investigating the crash site (only in the special edition, I believe). Cameron employs a careful choice of angles and lighting to make sure that it is Newt's face that stands out more than the others, even though she is a passive character at this point.<br/><br/>Cameron's dedication to his characters is matched by fine performances from the cast. Sigourney Weaver really runs the gamut, from her anger towards the company in the early scenes, through her steely determination before the enemy, to her maternal tenderness towards Newt. What is most impressive about her performance is that she is able to convince us throughout all these shifts in tone – her touching motherliness in no way diminishes our belief in her as a formidable heroine. The bunch of actors playing the marines give some distinctive performances. Given that the dialogue Cameron gives them is very sparse, they all have such narrow windows in which to make an impression. I'm especially impressed by Lance Henriksen, who gives a brilliant interpretation of the android character, mostly deadpan but with the occasional flicker of true emotion.<br/><br/>And all this is important because Aliens is ultimately a very emotional movie. There are some really beautiful story arcs here – Ripley learning to trust an android, redeeming herself after being castigated by The Company and belittled by the marines, and finally regaining a daughter (this is one of the reasons why the special edition is really essential, because it establishes all these arcs properly). And this is really one way that Aliens is very much not like a typical video game, which is unlikely to include any such humanity and poignancy. Aliens stands as not just the perfect audience-involving action movie, but a powerful example of this pure storytelling medium."
"oneguyrambling","10","1","2","17 December 2010"," Sets the bar for all other sci-fi actioners to aim for.
","Aliens is as good a film as there has been over the last 30 years, better than almost everything that preceded it and 99.99% of what has come since.<br/><br/>After the shambles that occurred aboard the space vessel Nostromo in the original Alien film, the only survivor Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her cat floated aimlessly for many years in the escape pod until they were found. 57 years in fact. This meant that Ripley had actually outlived her daughter and all known relatives, so she was handed back to her employer as the nearest thing to next of kin. After some initial questioning the company decide to pin the disaster on Ripley, conveniently ignoring all references to a 9 foot tall drooling creature with acid blood as the fanciful ramblings of a lunatic.<br/><br/>(There is no reference to whether the cat was charged also.) Not long after her return to the real world, Ripley's former employer sends a representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) to ask for help. It turns out that the deserted planet on which the alien life form was found had been colonized, and until recently regular contact was made with the 70 families entrusted with trying to make the planet more inhabitable based on the planet.<br/><br/>But recently all contact was lost After much soul searching Ripley agrees to go on the search mission, as long as the one priority is to wipe out any non-human located. She joins a bunch of bonehead soldiers, along with Burke, and soon finds that one of the crew is an ""artificial person"" named Bishop (good old robotic Lance Henricksen). Ripley, remembering the fun aboard the Nostromo, is none too pleased.<br/><br/>The soldiers are not actually the normal faceless mob who happen to be wearing the same colour, they are all lead by Sergeant Apone, a cigar chomping black guy with a booming voice who leads by example.<br/><br/>Once on the planet surface the ""ferry"" ship maintains safe distance and the ground crew proceed in a massive armoured troop transport vehicle, initially everything goes smoothly. There are signs of struggle, no evidence though of survivors, and everyone performs in a militaristic (natch) and precise manner. After being deemed ""safe"" Ripley, Burke, Bishop and the mission's inexperienced overseeing Lieutenant head in.<br/><br/>Out of the blue contact is made, though not deliberately. A young girl, perhaps 9 or 10 is located on surveillance equipment, after a brief chase Ripley grabs the girl. It appears that she has been surviving on solely her wits for many weeks by darting in and out of nooks and tunnels to escape notice. Her name is Newt, and she and Ripley immediately bond under pressure in a sort of proxy Mother/Daughter relationship.<br/><br/><ul><li>– - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - </li></ul><br/><br/>The team proceed on into the facility to search for survivors or other <br/><br/>Contact! Unseen and largely untraceable, the Aliens set upon the soldiers. Ripley, again aboard the troop carrier decides to step up as the Lieutenant proves useless. She saves the day (for some) and from here on in it is basically ""Ripley & Co"".<br/><br/>Safe for now, the survivors formulate what seems a simple plan. Of course this is almost immediately compromised and the remainder of the film has them warding off the Aliens, and internal forces at times while they attempt to desperately get themselves off the planet safely.<br/><br/>There are simply too many classic things to mention here but the frantic pace steps up yet again once they discover that automatic emergency measures have triggered the self destruct sequence and the whole facility is primed to blow soon. From here the last 40 minutes runs in practically real time, with an automated warning system calmly counting down till things go boom-boom. Ripley simply starts kickin' ass and taking names, and the final battle ends with a massive showdown that has become very well known for the 2 gangly female protagonists, one impossibly tall, gaunt and ferocious, the other an Alien-Queen.<br/><br/><ul><li>– - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - – - </li></ul><br/><br/>The Aliens are far better realized this time round, the mechanics that run the head SFX are especially realistic, and there are some great lingering shots with Aliens and prey face to face. <br/><br/>They are obviously more fluid and flexible, moving with disturbing ease and grace before unwinding to attack in savage fashion. They are single minded, vicious and - as it turns out - smart. <br/><br/>The film is especially quotable even 20+ years on, and also features some great character performances, Beihn is strong in his role as the determined soldier (even though he doesn't have to do much but clench his jaw and look serious), Reiser is especially weasely and unlikable as Burke, and Newt does the job, that being simply to not be an annoying and distracting ""cutesie"" kid.<br/><br/>But it is Paxton who steals the show as Hudson, the first half of his performance is all bravado and cockiness, but after he sees what they are up against he turns into the funniest whiner in a looong time.<br/><br/>Aliens was ahead of its time in 1986, and I would argue that it still is, as even with all the CGI and high budget stuff being churned out these days nothing comes close to having the visual (and visceral) impact that Aliens still pulls off.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 9.5 / 10. So near perfection it's ridiculous."

","The last time we saw Ripley, she was in an escape shuttle, in hyper-sleep on a course to Earth.<br/><br/>The story now continues from this point.<br/><br/>Full Plot: Her shuttle is intercepted by a deep-space salvage team. They secure the shuttle and board it and find Ripley still alive in her cryo-tube. She is later revived and is told that she had been drifting in space for the last fifty-seven years. She inquires about her daughter but is told that she recently passed away from old age.<br/><br/>At an interview before a panel of executives from her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, her testimony regarding the Alien is met with extreme skepticism as no physical evidence of the creature survived the destruction of the Nostromo. Ripley loses her space flight license as a result of her ""questionable judgment"" and learns that LV-426, the planet where her crew first encountered the Alien eggs, is now home to a terraforming colony.<br/><br/>Some time later, Ripley is visited by Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) and Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope) of the Colonial Marines, who inform her that contact has been lost with the colony on LV-426. The company decides to dispatch Burke and a unit of marines to investigate, and offers to restore Ripley's flight status and pick up her contract if she will accompany them as a consultant. Traumatized by her previous encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses to join, but accepts when she realizes that the mission will allow her to face her fears, which had been plaguing her since her first encounter. Aboard the warship Sulaco she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, including Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews), Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Privates Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Hudson (Bill Paxton), and the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), toward whom Ripley is initially hostile due to her previous experience with the android Ash aboard the Nostromo.<br/><br/>The heavily-armed expedition descends to the surface of LV-426 via dropship, where they find the colony seemingly abandoned. Two living Alien facehuggers are found in containment tanks in the medical lab, and the only colonist found is a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt (Carrie Henn). The marines determine that the colonists are clustered in the nuclear-powered atmosphere processing station. There they find a large Alien nest filled with the cocooned colonists. The Aliens attack and kill most of the unit, but Ripley rescues Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson. With Gorman knocked unconscious during the rescue, Hicks assumes command and orders the dropship to recover the survivors, intending to return to the Sulaco and destroy the colony from orbit. However, a stowaway Alien kills the dropship pilots in flight, causing the vessel to crash into the processing station; subsequently, the surviving humans barricade themselves inside the colony complex.<br/><br/>Ripley discovers that it was Burke who ordered the colonists to investigate the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the Alien eggs, and that he hopes to return Alien specimens to the company laboratories where he can profit from their use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop soon informs the group of a greater threat: the damaged processing station has become unstable and will soon detonate with the force of a thermonuclear weapon. He volunteers to use the colony's transmitter to pilot the Sulaco's remaining dropship to the surface by remote control so that the group can escape. Ripley and Newt fall asleep in the medical laboratory, awakening to find themselves locked in the room with the two facehuggers, which have been released from their tanks. Ripley is able to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of attempting to smuggle implanted Alien embryos past Earth's quarantine inside her and Newt, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines in hypersleep during the return trip. The electricity is suddenly cut off and numerous Aliens attack through the ceiling; Hudson, Burke, Gorman, and Vasquez are killed, and Newt is captured by the Aliens.<br/><br/>Ripley and an injured Hicks reach Bishop and the second dropship, but Ripley is unwilling to leave Newt behind. She rescues Newt from the hive in the processing station, where the two encounter the Alien queen and her egg chamber. Ripley destroys most of the eggs, enraging the queen, who escapes by tearing free from her ovipositor. Closely pursued by the queen, Ripley and Newt rendezvous with Bishop and Hicks on the dropship and escape moments before the colony is consumed by the nuclear blast. Back on the Sulaco, Ripley and Bishop's relief at their narrow escape is interrupted when the Alien queen, stowed away on the dropship's landing gear, impales Bishop and tears him in half. Ripley battles the queen using an exosuit cargo-loader. The two of them tumble into a large airlock, which Ripley then opens, expelling the queen into space. Ripley clambers to safety and she, Newt, Hicks and the still-functioning Bishop enter hypersleep for the return to Earth.<br/><br/>Epic is a small word to describe this film. The direction, background music and special effects is nothing short of ""out-of-this-world"". All the actors in the film excel in the roles given to them.<br/><br/>Notable Actors: Lance Henriksen makes an impact as the android Bishop. <br/><br/>William Hope is superb as Lieutenant William Gorman.<br/><br/>Paul Reiser is outstanding as Carter J. Burke, the corporate lawyer for the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.<br/><br/>Michael Biehn gives a solid performance as Corporal Dwayne Hicks.<br/><br/>Jenette Goldstein plays the macho female Private Jenette Vasquez<br/><br/>Mark Rolston plays Private Mark Drake, Private Vasquez's smart-gun partner.<br/><br/>Carrie Henn plays Newt, real name Rebecca Jorden, a child who is the only survivor of the colony on LV-426. She forms a close bond with Ripley.<br/><br/>Overall 10/10 points. Buy the ""special edition"" with the 17minutes added footage on DVD/BLU-RAY."

In my opinion, Aliens manages to be even better than the first film. With the mixture of suspense, horror and action that James Cameron puts into Aliens, Aliens manages to be suspenseful and filled with ridiculously entertaining action at the same time. When watching Aliens, you know that you are watching a good quality sci fi horror film. You know this because while watching Aliens, the visual effects are incredibly realistic and Aliens is not cheesy. Unlike Starship Troopers, which is in my opinion one of the wost sci fi films ever made.<br/><br/>Aliens is also home to about 3 of some of the greatest quotes in movie history. This is another reason that contributes to aliens quite possibly the best sci fi movie ever made.<br/><br/>Aliens is a must see for everyone.

Ellen Riply (Sigourney Weaver) awakens from the escape pod 57 years later, only to realize that the planet where she first encountered the creature is now inhabited.<br/><br/>This movie had all the trappings of failure (its a little over 2 hours long, its a science fiction movie, its a sequel and the original director did not return to helm the picture), yet each time I see this masterpiece, I am gripped with apprehension, terror and sheer pleasure at the action, acting and story that is unfolding before me. Much of the credit goes to Cameron, fresh from his success of Terminator, and before he went on to bring us such groundbreaking films like The Abyss and Terminator 2. His direction and writing (two other writers helped craft the end story) set the right pace for this film that allowed for us to feel the tension of the situation and to get attached to the characters and want each of them to survive (or rather the main ones anyway). And he didn't take the movie into a sole horror movie as the original one was. He made this a sci-fi movie, which meant that Cameron could make this movie similar to the original, yet make it his own, with the end result being this movie. But the director can only take so much of the credit. In comes the actors.<br/><br/>Headed by Weaver, the acting is top notch, with a tight supporting cast, including Michael Biehn, Lance Henrikson, Paul Reiser, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstien. Each actor brought with them a niche that fit in well with the film. Paxton's Hudson was nervous wreck while Biehn's Hick's was the cool cat that held the unit together while Weaver's Ripley 'lead' them. You wanted to punch William Hope's Lt. Gorman while if you ever got into a fire fight, you'd want Vasquez (Goldstien) fighting by your side. These were characters you related to and cheered (or jeered) for. With the extended version that was released a few years ago, we were treated with several extended and added scenes that helped build already strong characters and bring irony to the movie (you have to watch to understand this).<br/><br/>Acting and directing can take you so far. Without a decent Special Effects crew, this movie would be at the best a B movie, good for laughs instead of chills. Thankfully, Stan Winston and his studio was ready for the task and the Alien creatures (there would be more then one in this movie as compared to the sole Alien in the original, hence the titles) looked superb. From the aliens, to the weapons and ships, the special effects are wonderful never once being campy or plastic looking (note, there are NO computer generated effects, these are all models, miniatures or customs). As a kid, I wanted a Pulse Rifle because it looked and sounded cool, while I wanted never to met an alien because, well, they're not really nice. This is one of those films that, no matter how many times I watch it, I cannot spot fake looking aliens, or bad background art. It seems that the crew shot on location, which is what we the audience want.<br/><br/>Finally, the score needs to be mentioned. James Horner wrote a wonderful musical piece that adds to the suspense and drama of the movie. Its hard to explain it in words, but the musical score pulls you into the movie just that little bit more, adding to your experience. Without Horner's touch, it's impossible to truly experience Aliens.<br/><br/>If you hadn't guessed, I'm a fan of Aliens, and I recommend the movie whole heartedly. You won't be disappointed, whether your want to watch it as a pure sci-fi film, or as an action movie, or as a general lover of movies. This is a must see and a must own for the die hard fans..."
"gigan-92","10","1","2","3 June 2010"," Surpasses the Original
","Grade: A +<br/><br/>James Cameron is the genius behind this masterpiece. One of my Top 15 films ever, I saw this film only two years ago actually. Does it surpass the original? A question I pondered for some time—that is till I discovered the existence of an extended cut of the film. And so with that ""Aliens"" has become the victor.<br/><br/>Before I say anything else let me say I Love our cast. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley, the stone wall character who decides to leave behind her nightmares and conquer them. Soon though she finds it'll be no easy task. Michael Biehn delivers the famous line, ""I like to keep this handy for close encounters."" Gotta love the duo of Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and Hudson (Bill Paxton). The bond between Ripley and Newt, played by the young Carrie Henn, is a pivotal point in the film, showing that human affection can outweigh even the darkest and deep set fear.<br/><br/>Another point worth bringing up is the art direction and sets. Cameron made sure he lived up to the original's greatness in this regard. All throughout the film darkness is prevalent and it terrifies the audience. The cast only compounds the tension. The xenomorph design has been modified, but they are looking better than ever. For 1986, the Queen is very well done herself. Hearing that ragged breathing, seeing that humongous crest, the beast is overall imposing. In fact that must be my favorite scene, that final battle is f*ckin epic. LV-426 is now a colony and that alien nest has got to be them most chilling set in the film.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is eerie and fits the film perfectly, even without Jerry Goldsmith. To sum it up, one of the greatest sequels ever, a fusion of sci-fi, drama, and horror that will leave one stunned. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend the extended cut."

","When I see 800+ reviews, I think ""do I have anything to add here""? I haven't read every review here, but I DID want to share how my experience of this film changed over time. I will preface it by stating that I had recently purchased the wonderful 'director's cut' of the film. The theatrical release would only rate an 8 out of 10, but Cameron's re-edited version is a solid 9.<br/><br/>I found it interesting that when I saw Aliens in the theater, in my late teens, I loved it for a straight-forward action film. When I watched it again now, as the father of a toddler and a newborn, and with the scene of Ripley discovering her daughter had died put back in (can't believe they ever cut this crucial element), it suddenly had an incredible new depth. Ripley's discovery of Newt, and the strength of parental love, gave new meaning to everything Ripley (and the Queen alien) did. The action and humor were still there, still great, but now there was so much more....a whole movie within a movie. Anyone who poo-poos Newt as a plot device to the story is likely childless, I would guess.<br/><br/>One more aside...one reviewer mentioned that the QWERTY keyboards probably wouldn't be around in the future. I have to add to that all the smoking early on. Probably something taken for granted in 1986, it now seems like cigarette smoking may become extinct in a few decades....<br/><br/>""Maybe you're not up on current events, pal, but we just got our asses kicked!!!"""
"mchemb","8","1","2","23 October 2009"," Fantastic, fun thriller that meets the standards of the 1st film and maybe even exceeds them!
","'Aliens' is a fantastic addition by director James Cameron to the now somewhat disappointing Alien franchise. He succeeds in meeting the standards of the first film by Ridley Scott and possible even goes as far as exceeding them. The basic premise is the same; a tense thriller set in space where a group of humans, in this case marines, fight to survive against a formidable foe, the Alien. The major difference between this film and its predecessor is that instead of one just Alien there are a lot more! Credit to James Cameron as with worries from the studio about the cost of producing so many Aliens he had to achieve the effect multiple creatures using only 6 Alien suits! An effect he succeeds in doing extremely well. Special mention should also go to to the set designers and lighting on this film who successfully transported me on board the ships and alien planets through fantastically intricate, expertly lit sets. The attention to detail is amazing (see if you can read the profiles of the previous crew members behind Ridley in the beginning of the film) and really adds to the credibility of the film. A real negative point of the film which I feel needs mention is the acting of the awfully stereotypical marine soldiers. With predictable dialogue and over the top Neanderthal caricatures they manage to make the film in parts unintentionally comical! An exceptionally cringy performance from Bill Paxton (usually a reliable actor) ranges from being a cocky arrogant hardman to dribbling scared mess seeming to contradict his own character with every scene. This often takes away from the credibility and suspense of the film. Having said that, the acting is not without star turns the drill Sergeant figure is witty (if still a little stereotypical) but special mention should go to the little girl, Carrie Henn, and of course Sigourney Weaver, who's brilliant heroine character is given more depth in this film which she pulls off with a plom. As a whole, the film manages to sustain suspense throughout through excellent use of fast cuts and POV camera shots, only easing the tension occasionally, allowing the audience to breath, before throwing them head first back into the action. James Cameron set out to make a 'fun, stand alone film that had resonance of the first alien feature'. Well Mr Cameron I say Job well done!"
"raymond-andre","9","1","2","8 October 2009"," Great movie, horrible score
","When I saw this film on the day of its release I was in 7th heaven. Every beat, every cut, every line delivery was nearly perfect. Except James Horner's horrible score. <br/><br/>I kept hearing Gorki Park, The Wrath of Khan, Krull and dozens of his earlier works, sometimes repeated with little or no change. <br/><br/>Granted the man had very little time to step in and write this score and little money. But this is a tragic case of a great film that could have been greater still.<br/><br/>But James Cameron ! When will he return to fiction film? It is a tragedy that he never got ""The Crowded Room"" off the ground. He was supposed to direct the story of Billy Milligan, the man with 23 separate and distinct personalities. At the time of Aliens and Terminator 2 people thought of him as only a special effects director. Only! But one has only to look at the ensemble acting in this film or think of Sarah Connor's breakdown scenes in the asylum to know how much Cameron loves actors.<br/><br/>Come on back James boy! We need you, if only to knock hacks like Michael Bay out of the arena."

Weaver does a bang up job as ripley and i couldn't think of any other actress to play the character. all and all, the marines are your typical kick ass and take questions later group so you get the feeling you'l see fireworks early. the aliens are amazing in this film and the art work for the aliens from HR Giger, who is amazing, are top notch. my favorite scene is when they are tracking the aliens with the equipment and you can see all the dots starting to surround them. you get the feeling that they are't gonna make it out alive( in fact most don't'). bravo to this movie!"
"grenmonkey","9","1","2","6 August 2009"," a great film.
","James Cameron had some big shoes to fill back in the mid 80's; Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) had been a huge commercial and critical success and James' job was to create a sequel to this film that was almost an instant classic in the industry. How to beat the first film and live up to the expectations set up so high by the first film and it's growing fan base? James' answer was to take the film into a completely new direction. The sci-fi horror was replaced with action (and even bits of humor), though still maintaining the scares and the suspenseful atmosphere of the first film. The combination of these elements turned out to be very much a working one and Aliens (1986) in my books is the definite ""Alien -experience"" of the franchise. The film took the original idea and developed it into something even more interesting and thrilling. The film can be held responsible of creating a set of pop-cultural benchmarks that still stand sturdy and defining the way action and sci-fi was represented on the film screen for decades to come.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has to face the alien race again when the connection to an outer space colonial settlement gets cut off. She unwillingly takes part in a rescue mission with a team of space Marines – scares, gunfire, screeches and some bits of laughter ensue.<br/><br/>The movie's a brilliant packet: the visual style, the story, the dialog, the special effects, the sound and music – every aspect of it is able to stands on it's own (in a sense) but combined it sums up to something very cool to look at and listen to. The film has aged gracefully and still looks great though some of the effects look a bit too obvious and ""old"" in todays standards but it's nothing that could hurt the over-all experience.<br/><br/>The cast is great and it (along with the visual style and design) is what makes the movie stand out. Sigourney is brilliant in the leading role and she and the alien creatures are together what the whole franchise is all about – in Aliens the character is on her best, both on paper and in Sigouneys performance. Michael Biehn (Hicks), Bill Paxton (Hudson), Janette Goldstein (Vasguez) and Al Matthews (Apone) are all great in their roles as are the one's not mentioned here except Carrie Henn (Newt) who fails to live up to the role that probably was too demanding for the very young actress. She doesn't destroy the movie in any means but in some of the scenes her performance breaks the ""movie magic"" and makes you very much aware that you're watching a kid playing a kid, not a kid being the character.<br/><br/>Aliens is one of the most iconic movies in the history of the industry and it still lives on strongly. It's thrilling and entertaining and I've been rambling about for way too long. A Great film. 4/4"
"tburke85","8","1","2","15 June 2009"," Aliens A Solid Sci-Fi Horror Sequel
","Aliens is a solid sci-fi horror sequel from director James Cameron whose admirable in making this movie. Cameron has show in all his movies his talent as filmmaker and this one is no different. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley set fifty years after the original which finds her character once again battling the nightmarish creature that killed her whole crew except this time there's more than one a lot more. Weaver is effective in the role and continues to be the best Ripley. The talented supporting cast are admirable in their roles including Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Bill Paxton. Some of them may have limited screen time but they make the best of their small parts in the movie. The rest of the cast are good in their roles too. The special effects are equally impressive especially for that time and the alien monster's still look terrifying including the Queen. The creature action is well executed and intense there's definitely more of it in this one than the original which made it feel a little more faster paced. Director James Cameron delivered on nearly everything that fans come to except from a good sequel by amping up the action, suspense, alien monsters, and body count which does make it a worthy sequel to the first one. Despite some flaws with character development the rest of the movie makes up for it. Overall Aliens is an entertaining sci-fi horror sequel with enough monster action, suspense, thrills, great special effects, terrifying villains, and exceptional performances from the cast (epecially Weaver and Biehn) who make this movie worth watching. Well done."
"Quebec_Dragon","9","1","2","27 May 2009"," One of the most influential sci-fi action thrillers of all time
","It's a different genre than the first film (action thriller instead of psychological suspense, both with sci-fi trappings) but it just works very very well. The space marines were a hoot and their interactions were quite fun. The creatures were also much better done than in the first film with a special mention to the new one at the end (one of the all-time great). For me, this sequel was more fun to watch, way more action-packed, generally more thrilling although it didn't have the novelty factor of the first film. The visual design was simply outstanding. It was a very influential film especially for video games in terms of plot, aesthetics, characters and creatures (Doom, Half-Life, Gears of Wars to name a few), probably more so than the first Alien. <br/><br/>Rating: 9 out of 10"
"jmaycock","9","1","2","25 May 2009"," Fantastic stuff
","Okay, some of the dialogue is a bit corny and could have been toned down. However, once the action gets started the soldiers are not so quick to joke around. I recently watched this again and introduced it to my wife who also loved it. Just one thing bugs me about how this film relates to the the previous one. In this film the company doesn't know anything about what happened in the first film until Riply tells them? Wasn't there a report sent? That aside, I really loved watching this again. They don't make them like they use to. What really kills me however is the mess they made with the next film. Everything we invested in this movie wipped out in the first 5 mins? Watch Alien and Aliens, but forget about the rest."

"tom_koopa","9","1","2","28 April 2009"," Just as good as Alien, just in a different environment.
","I was psyched when me and my parents agreed to watch Aliens on a Saturday evening. I was only 14 at the time, maybe a little too young for a film like this. Then again, I watched Alien as a 12-year old, so... yeah.<br/><br/>I didn't get all of the details on my first viewing, but it certainly gave me scares and thrills! Like the first movie, the acting, music and story is very good.<br/><br/>It's this film that made me a fan of Sigourney Weaver. Her character truly evolves in this movie. Starting out as a traumatized victim of the creature from the first film and ending up as a hard-core, caring mother. No one would mess with her children, that's for sure! <br/><br/>Like I mentioned in the title, the movie is just as good as Alien, but it takes place in a different environment. Not on a single spaceship in the middle of nowhere, but rather on a planet, in a complex inhabited by colonists. Well, it USED to be inhabited...<br/><br/>You see more of the creatures in this film, compared to Alien. But that's not a bad thing. It works well and they didn't over-use it, like Alien Resurrection.<br/><br/>I recommend getting the extended (special) version since it adds more to the story and it has a few extra scenes which add to the film as a whole.

"XweAponX","10","1","2","15 April 2009"," The Alien Queen!
","Q: ""What's laying these eggs?""<br/><br/>A: ""Something we haven't seen yet...""<br/><br/>This is a question we did not have any time to ask during the first film, we were too busy having our brains eaten, having molecular acid pumped at us, being raped by an Aliens Tail, and having Geiger's Alien salivating all over our spaceship.<br/><br/>In the theatrical version of Aliens, we are not even shown the Alien Ship - As we are in the extended cut. If we get to see the extended cut, we can see that the ship has further deteriorated at least on the outside, one of the huge U structures seems to have fallen down.<br/><br/>And so this is the film which gave James Cameron his ""acid"" test - And he had to re-visualise the universe that Ridley Scott created.<br/><br/>But he did not totally revamp that future imperfect... He added to it. He shows us the ""Company"" - The Weyland/Yutani company which went unnamed in the first film. He gives us a look into the Corporate which drives this future and their motivations.<br/><br/>And according to Cameron, that future is just as bleak as our present, including corporate criminals as portrayed by Paul Reiser and Military Meatheads portrayed by William Hope, Bill Paxton, Jeanette Goldstein and Cameron's own imported Michael Biehn. Cameron gives us a look at various personality types and how they would act in the future... Which is to say that there is not that much difference.<br/><br/>After viewing some of the Bonus features, and a very long documentary which was made alongside the original filming of this epic, it is amazing, how Cameron could do so much, and build a universe so big in the limited space he had to work with. Amazingly, the budget for this hyper epic was a mere 25 Million, which would barely pay for Pre-vis in any modern epic.<br/><br/>The first time I saw the Theatrical ""Aliens"" I was impressed by the hugeness of the production, the sets seemed titanic. This was just Cameron, who was very clever with the way he filmed scenes on the alien planet LV426. It is difficult to determine what set pieces are actually miniatures, and which are full sized. The Troop Transport was a beautiful redressing of an airplane tug.<br/><br/>Regardless of style difference between Ridley Scott and Cameron, this film is a seamless continuation of the story of ""Leftenant Ripley"". Cameron uses all the resources at his command to tell this story, and his library of ""tricks"" which he learned by working for veteran filmmaker Roger Corman: The amount of visual trickery done by Cameron which fakes us into believing that LV426 is a real planet is astounding.<br/><br/>The Aliens which are shown in this film, are a slightly different colour that the Scott's Geiger-made Alien.. And they do not have the shiny domed heads, which gave the Alien it's frightening, metallic aspect. Instead, they had Bone ridges which were probably cheaper to make. The fact that there are only maybe 5 or 6 actual alien suits is clouded under the impression that there are hundreds of these beasts.<br/><br/>There is nothing that needs to be added, or subtracted from this story, and the extended cut of the film is most satisfactory, bringing elements back in which ought not to have been cut, but probably were for time considerations: The initial scene where Newt's parents visit the Alien Shipwreck and get ""facehugged"" - Which includes a short look at the life in the colony, the children, and even the Weyland-Yutani logo... Which gives us the name of the company for the first time, except that this was not shown until the early 90s when the laserdisk of the extended cut was released. This scene was a critical piece of exposition, however, even when cut, the story survives brilliantly.<br/><br/>But in order to put this film on an equal bearing with the original Alien, Cameron showed us that which was laying the eggs: The Alien QUEEN. When I first saw it, I just assumed it was Geiger's work... But to my amazement, this creature was wholly designed by James Cameron- And he mimics Geiger's work so well, you just cannot tell.<br/><br/>The idea of the Queen gives us the shock value which the original film had: And when we first see this thing, we are agape. When I view the DVD, I must and do, rewind the scene and watch it again and again- Because that first impression is fantastic.<br/><br/>This film is one of the jewels of the 20th century, and when you consider that the Universe that was shown to us was wholly created by using practical effects, we wonder why this kind of film-making cannot be done anymore. We assume that this kind of practical film-making cannot be done due to cost, but that is not the case: This kind of film-making cannot be accomplished in these days because we lack one important thing: A Filmmaker of James Cameron's Caliber and ingenuity."

","Aliens is a very good follow up film to Alien. It is a great science fiction film that also has a lot of action in it.<br/><br/>Ripley wakes up 57 years after she went to sleep after getting rid of the alien. She is asked to help provide information regarding the aliens to help a military group that is going after a swarm of the aliens that wiped out a civilization. Reluctantly she agrees to help them. Once there the group encounters problems as the ship that they take to land on the planet is destroyed.<br/><br/>James Cameron took over as director of this film. He really did an outstanding job of making an action packed science fiction film that also has a lot of emotion. Great job.<br/><br/>The main thing great about this film is the action. There is plenty of weopons going off, explosions constantly, and lots fighting. Indeed the first alien film was part horror and part science fiction, but this one is part action and part science fiction. The combination of those genres works in this film the same way that the other combination worked for the first alien film.<br/><br/>The aliens are awesome in this film. Their look is revised a little to make them look more menacing and animal like. They also pop out of the most unsuspecting places. In the first Alien film there was only one alien in it, but this one has countless numbers of them. It almost seems that there is no end to them. Also this film introduces the Queen Alien whom is pretty terrifying. It also is important that she be introduced since she is the source for the alien eggs. A great villain creature that really is impressive.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is as good as ever. THe way that Ripley forms a bond with the young girl newt in this film shows just how good of an actress that Weaver is. One scene she is a strong female able to fend for herself, and the next she is a motherly figure who is very loving.<br/><br/>Also I liked how Michael Biehn was in this film. I thought he was great in Terminator and he is better in this film in my opinion. The cast as a whole is great.<br/><br/>An awesome sequel, just as good as the first if not better. It has great acting, action, and Aliens. Highly recommended."

","hm thought I would rewrite the review. zo here we go.<br/><br/>The credits appear, Aliens, the James Horner horns, the 2001 medley. Ray Lovejoy, Gale Ann Hurd, Dan'oBannon, JAMES CAMERON. We float into this film. Ellen the snow-white of the universe, our lucky star. How would you feel waking up with post traumatic stress, 57 years later. The memory of your social network, brutally killed by pure terror. How would you feel waking up not knowing anyone, not knowing your daughter, and not only that not knowing that she has long gone passed away. ""Jean Luc Piccard"", would have been good talking to about the family matters. But then Welcome To Ellen Ripleys life. Nicotine and coffee and bad dreams. BAD DREAMS, how could anyone but James Cameron do the dream sequence so scary! The slow motion is not out of sync, it fits the occasion, the hiss of Jonsy sparks the horror, and the music, heavy noisy horns and the slippery strings, the soundtrack is pure genius/terror, would leave every Bernard Herrmann sucker speechless ""including yours truly"", now the movie is rolling.<br/><br/>That's just the beginning, now comes the Cameron trade marks. Marines, large military cargo vessels, Robots. A whole lot of yelling. ""AH A BUNCH OF BADASSES!"", and ""God damn it, that's not all!"" ""We're on an express elevator to hell; going down!"" ""Whoopee-fuckin'-do. Hey, I'm impressed."" and so on. The script is by far the most aerodynamic to have come out of the last century. Line after line of perfect dialog, working class smack talk, working-class humor, this is some serious bad mouth ping pong. Quintin still has something to learn, (maybe Inglorious Bastards delivers, who knows).<br/><br/>Now lets recap a bit, we are in 1986! 1 9 8 6. Two years after the Return of the Jedi. CGI was an infant, a baby, only hours old, and James made this movie and its special effects timeless. To me movies today still looks up to Aliens, still pays respect to the pioneering work of pup-petering, editing, cinematography and a very important thing, namely Sound. Man the Spanish soaks of inspiration, take for instance Guillermo Del Toro! (Who is Mexican). The Dark Knight does not reach the magnificence of Aliens. Thou The Dark Knight tries really hard it is but a shadow in every aspect of Aliens. Reasons is clear, the delivery! Deliverance. Aliens Contra The Dark Knight, Aliens has a clear story, you never get lost, and Cameron looks you straight in the eye, the no bullshit technique. The Dark Knight on the other hand tries too hard, it is pretentious, and the result is a weak story, bad dialog, and the one carrying the movie is the Joker. Imagine Cameron only hitting the Alien Note. The Movie would fall apart! In Aliens the action is at the center of the story, in The Dark Knight the script falls upon it self and implodes due to an over long running time. Now Aliens too is a long movie, depending on which version you are watching. But that is of no importance, for if you buy the ticket you take the ride. And you feel the G-Force pulling and stretching your stomach, you feel the the thrill of going over the top, again ""We're on an express elevator to hell; going down!"" Conclusions, 10 out of 10, because it is the best action movie ever made. Dot Dot Dot."
"classicsoncall","9","1","2","1 February 2009"," ""Alright, I'm in"".
","For viewers who felt that the original ""Alien"" lacked action, this sequel provides enough for both, especially when it enters combat mode in the latter part of the story. Adrenaline junkies should find this a pretty good fix for their movie going high, still holding up well even after a couple of decades. The film does a decent job of expanding on the Alien mythos begun in the first film, where even a serious attention to detail fails to reveal what the true life cycle of the species might actually be. Not that all those questions are answered here, in fact there might even be a few more loose ends left by the time it's all over, but by then you're content enough just to catch your breath after a wild thrill ride. <br/><br/>The strange thing is that essentially, ""Aliens"" is pretty much a re-telling of the original story with enough alteration of significant plot points that you don't really notice it until well after the film is over. The whole story revolves around a brave female (Sigourney Weaver) returning to a planet (LV-426) that has lost contact with civilization due to an unknown calamity. Ripley leads a team of crew members on a hunt against an implacable and dangerous creature that winds up wiping out that entire crew, before it's finally defeated in a last ditch battle before being cast into the vacuum of space. In neither instance did it seem remotely plausible to me that a human could have survived the crushing forces of wind shear better than the much larger and stronger enemy, but one gets so caught up in the fever pitch emotion of good vs. evil that it doesn't really matter too much. We just want to see Ripley kick some monster a--!<br/><br/>What kind of gets lost in translation are some of the cool elements that form the back story of LV-426, a terra-formed 'shake and bake' space colony complete with it's own atmosphere processor. Those elements are only mentioned very quickly in passing, as is the nature of the unit dispatched to investigate the planet. The term Colonial Marines is only used once in the picture, but followers of the Alien saga know the term well, as they show up in any number of book and graphic novel treatments. It wouldn't be too far off the mark to say that they embody the typical fan boy concept of over the top universal soldier types complete with wise cracking banter and big guns,.... really, really big guns. But you know, I didn't hear anyone say 'Lock and Load' - or maybe I missed it.<br/><br/>There was even the inclusion of an android again, or as Bishop (Lance Henricksen) explained, an artificial person, a synthetic. I guess that shouldn't have surprised anyone, since the first picture established the science officer as an artificial life form. Still, the dismemberment of Bishop was much too reminiscent of Ash's demise to be original, there was just a little more of him at the end to make the save for Newt (Carrie Henn). I like Henricksen though, so I won't hold the script against him.<br/><br/>What was unnerving on a repeat viewing today was the role of Carter Burke as played by Paul Reiser. His portrayal worked for me back in 1986, but all I could think of now was 'Mad About You's' Paul Buchman trying to be the bad guy and it just doesn't work. But you'll be OK if you don't think Helen Hunt's husband'. <br/><br/>So on balance, a nice pair of thumbs up for ""Aliens"", a sequel that not only carries on the story from it's prequel, but actually enhances it. As the series progressed of course, the same can't be said, but we'll save that for another review."

","I don't know where to begin, other than by saying that Aliens is one of the greatest sequels in film history. I would give Aliens the same star rating I gave Alien, a perfect 10. After seeing just one alien cause damage in the first film, now we get to see hundreds. And all of this excellent action is backed up with an amazing, AMAZING, story. Aliens also introduces the source of the alien creatures, the massive alien queen. With great characters, a great story, great directing, great effects, and a great ending, this is one sequel you don't want to miss. In my opinion, the only film in history that is better than Aliens is Alien, though, like I said, I would give them both 10 stars."
"cchase","10","1","2","4 December 2008"," ""Ripley's-Believe-It-Or-Not-She's-Going-WHERE???""
","In any movie genre, you can practically count the instances on one hand where any sequel in a film series is either as good as, or surpasses the original. (GODFATHER TWO is the most- often used example).<br/><br/>ALIENS had no business being even as good as the Ridley Scott original, but thanks to James Cameron's penchant for militaristic fetishism and his knack for drawing sharp characters in harrowing situations, it manages in a lot of ways to best its predecessor. <br/><br/>It picks up right where the last one ended: Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is rescued as the sole survivor of the destruction of the freighter ship Nostromo. Unfortunately, she discovers that sole survivors make great scapegoats, so she is blamed for the ship explosion AND the deaths of the crew, and decommissioned. <br/><br/>Oh, but the fun has just started for Ripley. A little while after her disgraceful discharge, she gets a visit from an officer in the Colonial Marines. Seems that a group of colonists has disappeared, and would she be interested in helping re-locate them? More shocking than the fact that the-powers-that-be would ask her is the reason why they did: the totally clueless colonists decided to put down roots ON THE VERY SAME PLANETOID where the Nostromo crew checked out that ""distress signal"" which got the whole mess started in the first place!<br/><br/>To say she's reluctant to go back is putting it mildly, but not one to turn down a chance at clearing her name (not to mention getting in some payback), Ripley is ""imbedded"" with a bunch of battle-hardened, gung-ho Colonial Marine grunts who have no idea about the royal smackdown they're in for at the hands of the Aliens. The motley crew includes the irritatingly bitchy Pvt. Hudson (a scene-stealing Bill Paxton); Privates Drake (Mark Rolston) and ultra-butch Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) who are probably more than just 'comrades- at-arms'; Cpl. Dwayne Hicks (Michael Biehn) who shares a few brief romantic sparks with Ripley, and android helper Bishop (Lance Henriksen) with whom Ripley wants absolutely nothing to do with initially, the ordeal with Ash from Part One still raw and fresh in her mind.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention ""Company"" man and civilian rep Carter Burke? As played by Paul Reiser, it's the most hissable performance in the movie (almost more so than the Aliens'), and it rocketed his status from a guest-starring stand-up comedian to a bonafied actor. <br/><br/>All the Cameron trademarks are here: strong and flawed male characters, stronger and even more resilient female characters, cool weapons, intense battle sequences, tension and suspense by the boatload. And a new ingredient that elevates this sequel immediately: motherhood. Ripley, for whom self-preservation is like breathing, discovers the ""mommy- track"" when she bonds with the only survivor of the ravaged colony, a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), for whom Ripley suddenly realizes she'll take on anything to protect.<br/><br/>Good thing, too. Because as she discovers in one of the most classic sequences in sci- fi/horror history, even Aliens have mothers, too. Or in this case, one Queen Bitch of a Mother!<br/><br/>ALIEN still is an all-time classic without a doubt. But not having the sequel right along side it is like having a bag of Chips Ahoys...with no ""chips""!"
"mrmoviefreak261-1","9","1","2","29 November 2008"," Great sequel, exhilarating film
","The first alien movie, Alien, was good, scary and an acceptable starter for the declining Alien series. The first part was great. Yet the second one in my opinion, blew the first one away. The first one had a lot of mystery, deception and action, while the second one took all of that and expanded it to another level of aliens and action. Aliens is almost a non-stop action film, with a crazy and intense plot behind it. It's almost genius, this film and it takes a lot of potential to make a movie like this one. Yes, the special effects were pretty funny, but in all, none of that matters since the movie was so damn good. It's violent, and it's gritty and if you were watching this with your girlfriend, you'd get a lot of freaks and scares from her. It's intense, and brilliant. It's still a wonder to me on how James Cameron to do this film, and then to something like Titanic eleven years later."
"DavidSim240183","10","1","2","2 October 2008"," The mother of all aliens in a monster of a movie!
","Alien is a genuine landmark of SF cinema. Ridley Scott revolutionised the genre forever by taking a horror film and staging it within a science-fictional setting. The result was one of the most suspenseful, frightening horror shows ever seen on a cinema screen. It would be seven years before 20th Century Fox greenlit a sequel to the 1979 classic.<br/><br/>Considering the amount of time taken in the interim, that shows how badly 20th Century Fox wanted to get Aliens right, and avoid the trap of most sequels. Not to make it a rehash of the original. The director chosen to helm Aliens was James Cameron, just hot off the success of The Terminator. Filmed on a minute 7 million dollar budget, Cameron got an incredibly suspenseful action film out of it. His intense, muscular direction elevated The Terminator above B-movie territory and into classic status.<br/><br/>But with Aliens, Cameron makes the leap to big budget film-making with complete confidence. It may be mounted more as a straight up action film, but its every bit as scary as Alien. In fact its that all too rare example of a superior sequel. One where it takes the original film, and uses it as a framework to build upon. It manages to find a whole new spin on events. As all good sequels should do.<br/><br/>Where the original film only presented us with one alien, Cameron has broadened the horizons and given us a whole army of them. He's traded in the bio-mechanical world of the Nostromo for a more realist setting, a colony based on the same planet where they discovered the alien. And instead of a crew of blue-collar workers is a team of kick-ass Marines who get in way over their heads.<br/><br/>Of course it wouldn't be an Alien picture without Ellen Ripley, and sure enough Sigourney Weaver returns, after a 57 year journey through space, to combat the alien that shattered her life. Sigourney Weaver has polished her act considerably in the time that's passed, and gives us a deeper, more emotionally fragile Ripley. One who has nightmares every single night about the Alien, and will stop at nothing to eradicate it from the galaxy forever.<br/><br/>Most of the regulars who work with James Cameron are present too. The underrated Michael Biehn adds a steady anchor as Corporal Hicks, who forms a platonic relationship with Ripley. The always reliable Bill Paxton makes an early impression as the wisecracking Private Hudson. Lance Henrikson's emotionally detached style of acting is well suited to Bishop, the resident android. He brings some interesting ambiguities to Bishop. We're never really sure of him right up until the very end. And Jenette Goldstein is perfectly tough as Private Vasquez, one of the many resilient female characters Cameron likes to have in his films.<br/><br/>One of the more interesting touches Cameron brings to Aliens is the whole inclusion of a mother/daughter theme, between Ripley and Newt, the only survivor of the decimated colony. Only a little girl, Newt finds a kindred spirit in Ripley. Both sole survivors of the Alien, and both have been left emotionally shattered by it. The scenes between Sigourney Weaver and Carrie Henn are well written by Cameron (and given greater development in the Directors Cut), as each finds a new family in one another. And they're an interesting parallel with the Alien Queen, mothering and protecting her children.<br/><br/>Of course Aliens' greatest success is in its action scenes. And they're just as ferocious and intense as you'd expect from James Cameron. But he uses them sparingly. Much like Ridley Scott, Cameron takes his time with the movie. He allows for a subtle buildup which generates some fine suspense, and then erupts like a powerhouse in the action scenes. The Alien attacks towards the end really gets the adrenaline pumping. Watching them break through doors, ceilings, and airshafts, they recapture something of the claustrophobia of Alien.<br/><br/>But even better is a much quieter scene where Ripley and Newt are trapped in a sound-proofed room with two face-huggers. Its the one scene in the whole film where Cameron gets the terrible suspense of Alien down pat, and integrates it into his movie perfectly. He draws it out with such dexterity that you feel just as vulnerable as the characters.<br/><br/>Cameron also takes the opportunity to answer a few of the questions left dangling by Alien. Like who lays the eggs? The Alien Queen is a masterful creation straight out of a nightmare. To describe her is an impossible task. But she's a product of some stupendous work from the late and great Stan Winston. She's one of his finest creations. Our first sight of her is one of SF cinema's most heart-stopping moments.<br/><br/>James Cameron is not above reusing some of the same plot points of the first film. Again we get Ripley making a mad dash through a close to exploding reactor. But in this case, its to rescue Newt, and not a cat. And the added spin of the Alien Queen becomes a fresh twist on the same story. That in of itself would have been a great ending, only Cameron has more in store. The fight between Ripley and The Queen, in an exo-skeletal loader on the edge of an open airlock is a superb finale.<br/><br/>Aliens is a magnificent sequel. Cameron does the original justice, by having so much respect for it. The Directors Cut is even better. Unlike Alien, the DC improves upon the film, and doesn't take anything away from it. It fleshes out the characters and ups the tension. Alien didn't need a DC. It was flawless to begin with, but Aliens: The Directors Cut is a masterpiece."
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","Null","1","2","17 June 2008"," Wonderful sequel!
","Aliens is one of the few cases of a sequel that far surpassed the original. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, who awakens on Earth only to discover that she has been hibernating in space so long that everyone she knows is dead. Then she is talked into traveling (along with a squad of Marines) to a planet under assault by the same aliens that nearly killed her. Once she gets there, she finds a lost little girl who triggers her maternal instincts--and she discovers that the company has once again double-crossed her, in hopes of capturing one of the aliens to study as a military weapon. Directed and written by James Cameron, this is one of the most intensely exciting (not to mention intensely frightening) action films ever, with a large ensemble cast that includes Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Michael Biehn. Weaver defined the action woman in this film and walked away with an Oscar nomination for her trouble."
"dunmore_ego","8","1","2","29 April 2008"," The Warrior/Goddess Dichotomy and the Eternal Feminine
","ALIENS! <br/><br/>Leaping, screeching, hissing, grabbing - hellish armies of H.R. Giger's inscrutable extra-terrestrial life forms, swarming killing machines going elongated-head to jar-head with the United States Marines (Roger Ramjet Space Division, Glib Company).<br/><br/>Writer-Director James Cameron helms this sequel to one of the landmark space/horror films of our time, ALIEN (1979). And it shows. Not one for subtlety, Cameron creates a script (with David Giler and Walter Hill) that bluntly screams ""More is Better""  more aliens, more victims, more explosions and incredible amounts of more mucus. Surprisingly - he gets away with it.<br/><br/>A colony of humans on a remote planet has lost contact with Earth. The military sends a reconnoiter mission, along with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver, recently rescued from suspended animation in a drifting escape pod some eighty years after blowing up the Nostromo in ALIEN). She is more than miffed that the planet she is forced to return to is the one she just escaped from (in ALIEN - Director's Cut scenes actually show the crashed ""horseshoe"" spaceship from ALIEN and Newt's father getting face-hugged at its base).<br/><br/>Sho' nuff, send the Marines in anywhere and everything gets pear-shaped. After aliens *en masse* peel from the mucused walls of the space colony corridors and decimate the grunts, the remaining Marines (under Ripley's ad hoc supervision) must find a way to leave the planet and nuke it.<br/><br/>There are so many factors that make the ALIEN series so much more than just Running-and-Screaming debacles. A major factor was Swiss surrealist, H.R. Giger's alien design, overseen in this movie by legendary creature-creator Stan Winston. The life-cycle of the aliens was also well thought out, which gave them an organic depth that simple zombies or big-eyed beige beings lacked. Like some interesting insect species here on Earth, the alien warriors do not simply eat or kill all their captives, but cocoon them to serve as host bodies for their hatchling stage (the face-huggers), which impregnate the captive with the seed that grows into the chest-burster (which John Hurt will never forget).<br/><br/>Cameron, who is renowned for his Wham-Bam, actually cleverly inserts major Thank-You-Ma'am into this movie. At first blush, ALIENS looks like any summer Boy's Movie, but look closer and you'll notice that it is actually a *homage* to the Eternal Feminine! All the males are either emasculated or ineffectual: Apone the Marine captain (Al Mathews) is dispatched in the first battle, Gorman the coordinator (William Hope) is bitchslapped by Ripley when he crumbles during a skirmish, Hudson the grunt (Bill Paxton, in an immortal sissy role which will haunt him for life) takes girlie whining to a truly vaginal level (""Game over, man! Game over!"") and Paul Reiser is perfectly cast as a corporate weasel. The most masculine Marine is Vasquez, a dirt-talking' Mexican dyke who has bigger guns (on her arms and around her neck) than any actual male Marine.<br/><br/>The only male worth his cahonnes is Hicks (Michael Biehn)  and even he ended up taking orders from Ripley. The other male of any note: Bishop the cyborg (Lance Henriksen, in an emphatic ""synthetic person"" performance)  and he got torn in half. All the other male Marines were like those nameless Star Trek crewmen who beamed down to a planet with the principle actors<br/><br/>Cameron boldly brings us Sexy Dangerous with Ripley: whereas in ALIEN she was an innocent youth who grew into her formidable anti-alien role (with a wink-wink end-scene that stripped her down to panties to remind us of her femininity), here she is the vetted warrior, tougher than Marines, yet maternal enough to dote on a surrogate child; she may slam the corporate weasel against the wall, but when Hicks gives her a location bracelet (""Doesn't mean we're engaged or nothing"") her alluring smile is radiant. Cameron has brilliantly created what every man craves - a woman powerful enough to stand on her own feet, yet beautiful enough to attract you into sweeping her off them. The Warrior/Goddess dichotomy. (If it weren't for that soccer mom 'do, she'd be perfect!) And he does it in such an artful way that we don't feel threatened or repulsed by it.<br/><br/>Even the final battle is between Ripley and the alien queen, as the queen chases Newt (young Carrie Henn, who never made another movie), Ripley interjecting with the now-famous, ""Get away from her, you BITCH!""  a female going after a female, being stopped by a female.<br/><br/>This is a thunderous movie, fulfilling our every craving to see bigger, badder, madder aliens and see them in full action, in full view. Boldly directed and shot, with incredible detail paid to the species that spawned so many inferior copycats. The egg-laying scene, in the cavern with the queen alien, is a mind-stopper.<br/><br/>And in the film's final minutes  even WITH all the female empowerment flying at our testicles  Our Man James Cameron somehow manages to get Ripley down to her panties again!...."
"RichardKleiner","10","1","2","23 April 2008"," Exactly what a sequel should be.
","James Cameron took over the helm of directing and partly writing a second installment in the future Alien series. As it has happened before, a different director is a bad sign for a sequel. However, the end result for AlienS is excellent.<br/><br/>First of all, this is a completely different story and film overall. It has basically the same titular characters (Ripley and the Alien), but the plot takes a different direction than the first.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley's life ship is found wandering in space, with no course set. This is 57 years after Ripley's first encounter with the Alien. Now, the same planet that crew mate Kane visited for his doom, is now populated and with a breathable air treatment. However, after a accident similar to the one that occurred in the first Alien, contact on the colony is lost. The Company responsible for the Colony then sends a group of Marines with Ripley as consultant to investigate what happened, and if necessary, eradicate the threat.<br/><br/>There is no longer a mystery or suspense of what is going on. You already now what is happening. So the tone of the film is more action-oriented. And it works excellently.<br/><br/>Even as it is an action movie, Ellen Ripley's character has even more depth and development than in the previous. First off, she meets a little girl, sole survivor of the Alien attack, and identifies with her, forming a mother-daughter bond. The dramatic and action sequences are excellently meshed together and balanced. I wonder if James Cameron knew this movie was going to be the masterpiece that it is. As for the characters, the Marines are great. A rugged assortment of bad-asses/cowards, the variety is good. My personal favorite was Bill Paxton.<br/><br/>James Horner's score is amazing. It starts very calmly, with a tender space wanderer melody, and builds up to a great trailer-music-like climax, and return to it's mellow beginning.<br/><br/>The visual effects left me stunned. The fact that there were only six aliens in the film and the genius fast paced editing just stuns me even more. The Queen was so convincing in it's movements that I actually believed it was CGI. As for the guns and stage settings, they were also quite convincing. The hallways for the colony were reminiscent to the ones in the Nostromo, giving the classic and iconic image of the Alien.<br/><br/>This is exactly what a sequel should be. A completely different story, although in the same continuity with the first film. I may probably feel tempted to nominate this one for best sequel ever."
"DanielWRichardson","10","1","2","16 April 2008"," Excellent sequel
","It's rare when a sequel is as good as the original. It's even more rare when it's better than the first. But one man can do it. James Cameron is that man. ""Aliens"", to me at least, is right up there with the original. I can never choose which one I like better. Actually, I like ""Alien"" more just because it's more of a horror movie, but still ""Aliens"" is great. Cameron also did it again with ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" which is better than the first. This guy could do a sequel to ""Titanic"" and it would be great. Wouldn't you guys like to see ""Titanic 2""? What makes this movie great is the action. He took it in a different direction and it worked. The first one was more of a horror movie in space and was full of suspense. This is just non-stop action. The problem with the other two sequels (don't get me wrong I like both) was that they didn't try to be different. Part 3 was more or less part 1 and Resurrection was... um, tried to be horror at times, then tried to be action. Since the first one was sci-fi/horror and the second one was sci-fi/action with elements of war, the third one could have been like a sci-fi/mystery. Then the fourth one could have been sci-fi/comedy with elements of drama. Of course I'm joking, but you see my point. 3 & 4 were good, just not great. Sorry, I got side tracked. This is suppose to be about ""Aliens."" The story continues perfectly, which is what you need for a good sequel. The direction is great, as is the story. All the acting is good. There seems to be a lot of dislike of the Hudson character. What most people call annoying, I call funny. So if your an ""Alien"" fan, sci-fi/action fan, or just want to see a great four star movie, then you need to see this movie."
"film_lover2008","10","1","2","4 April 2008"," Camerons adrenaline filled roller-coaster ride
","Aliens was a big part of my child hood which is unusual to say as the film is not aimed at children. However at the age of 6 I managed to view the film and can remember just been amazed with what I saw.<br/><br/>11 years later my thoughts on the film are still the same as they were back when I first saw the film. The actors, the character development, the action, soundtrack, atmosphere, sets and almost any other element of the film really do make this movie an utter masterpiece.<br/><br/>This in my opinion is one of the greatest sequels ever made. Reason for this is how Cameron managed to alter the genre however give it a similar feel to the original instalment and made it into a really worthy entry in the Alien saga.<br/><br/>This time everything has changed, there is not just one Alien to fight, but instead there are hundreds of the bad asses! Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) must this time take on an entire Alien hive and the Queen Alien herself.<br/><br/>This adrenaline filled action film is possibly the best 2 hours of film I have ever experienced and is one of those films that everyone must see. Been a big fan of Camerons work I must say this is his best work yet (however Terminator 2 comes very close too) <br/><br/>10 out of 10!!!"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","2","30 March 2008"," A perfect sequel (spoilers)
","Thank the cinematic gods for pluralisation. 'Oh, what's that? Alien only had one critter? Well, let's slap an 's' on the end of the title and have hundreds of the bastards. It'll be great.' And indeed it is. <br/><br/>Die-hard fans of Alien may bemoan the different approach that Cameron takes  lots of guns and the Aliens themselves reduced to bugs to be blown to pieces  but the film is true to Scott's original while taking it in a new direction. It's a perfect sequel. The fidelity to the original includes the creepy atmosphere and the slow build-up, but this film has more action and more of an emotional pull. Indeed, it's the relationship between Ripley and Newt that elevates it to something more than just an excellent action film.<br/><br/>The final act, which sees Ripley head off alone into the Alien nest in order to rescue what has become her surrogate daughter, has a whiff of absurdity to it. Skinny woman with a massive gun and flamethrower attached to her and she's going to kick butt? Yeah, right. But because Weaver and Cameron play it so straight, and because you've become so attached to the characters over the course of the film, it seems like the only thing that could happen. You totally believe in Ripley. This is something she just has to do. <br/><br/>And it helps that there are no attempts to indulge in empty grandstanding. This is just a simple case of a mother going into hell to rescue her daughter. And as everyone knows, there's nothing in the world you should fear more than a woman who's trying to get her child back. Mothers are tougher than any Alien Queen, a point illustrated by the fabulous moment when Ripley burns the Alien Queen's eggs.<br/><br/>However, the bond between Ripley and Newt was less explicit in the original cut. But in the Special Edition we get a great scene where we find out, because she spent so much time drifting through space in hypersleep after surviving the Nostromo, that Ripley's real child has died as an old woman. It's a great little scene and gives more depth to the relationship between Ripley and Newt. I'm kind of baffled as to why it was cut out.<br/><br/>However, other stuff in the Special Edition doesn't fare quite as well. The least successful inclusion is the scene on the colony where we see Newt's parents find the derelict alien ship from the first film. It's kind of pointless and it's not particularly well filmed or acted  I can easily see why it was cut out. And plus, part of the joy of Aliens was not knowing exactly what happened on the colony. It was creepier when we could try and imagine it ourselves. <br/><br/>I'm also not a huge fan of the sentry gun sequences. Most people tend to love them, thinking they add to the tension. But to me they only seem to highlight the budgetary restrictions. You seem to see the same bit of footage of an Alien exploding over and over again. Plus, for me, there was greater tension when you saw less of the Aliens. The longer you have to wait for the attack, the bigger the pay-off because you've been wound up that little bit more.<br/><br/>But although the big attack where the Aliens come crashing through the ceiling is magnificent, I prefer the first encounter; the one where the cocky Marines are slaughtered in the hive. What makes the scene so fantastic is the way Cameron uses the Marines' cameras, the ones they have strapped to them, to add to the confusion of the attack. It makes it even more visceral - we see a lot of the action take place on a series of monitors.<br/><br/>But this use of monitor footage also serves as a nod to Alien. When Dallas and his crew head off to the derelict ship this technique is used to build tension. But Aliens takes the concept that little bit further. And it's this unseen enemy, and the Marines' cockiness, that makes it feel like a Vietnam War film. The Marines start off with complete confidence and then are gradually broken down by an enemy that is less well equipped but that can adapt to its environment better.<br/><br/>However, going back to the way that Cameron builds upon the ideas that were started in Alien, I love the use of Bishop in the film. After Ash in the first film, we maybe expect another unhinged robot or at very least a company stooge. And at the beginning Ripley treats him like crap. But after hinting that he might be another android psycho, he turns out to be heroic. And it's a lovely moment when Ripley finally tells Bishop that he did well. In a film that is relentlessly violent, it's nice to have a moment that has such warmth.<br/><br/>Aside from building on the concepts started in the first film, another one of Cameron's strengths is creating memorable characters. No one gets lost in the mix. All the grunts stand out. My personal favourite is Hudson, the whinging scaredy cat who eventually grows a massive set of balls and kicks some serious Alien butt before being killed. Every line he utters is a work of genius. Then there's Vasquez. I don't know what it is about Cameron, but he always seems to be able to create believably tough female characters. Therefore it doesn't ring untrue when she kicks an Alien in the head and shoots it in the face. You believe this woman is capable of doing this. <br/><br/>But smaller characters stand out as well. Drake and the Sergeant are great in what limited time they have, and I love Gorman, the poindexter turned good. And then there's Burke, who proves that a greedy company man will always be worse than an acid-drooling monster."

","The action is pure adrenaline. Guns, explosions, crashes, shouting... Everything an action junkie could ask for and more! Cameron's realism is frighteningly effective. Despite the fact that his story takes place in the distant future, his treatment of it makes the real world seem a bit less safe.<br/><br/>The cast is dynamite! Weaver, Biehn, Reiser, Henriksen, Pullman... Everybody gives 110% performances, so the audience cares about their fates. I really like the crush between Ripley and Hicks. There is an obvious attraction between them, but it's very hushed, almost childlike, making it much easier to relate to and, therefore, enjoyable. It adds nice bits of levity to the conflict without interfering with the story in any way.<br/><br/>The film is spectacular on its own, but James Horner's score makes it outstanding! He, like Cameron, masterfully infuses horror and action elements together to make the audience's adrenaline pump double time.<br/><br/>Aliens is, in my opinion, a perfect film. It utilizes every good story telling technique to make an absolutely compelling tale that you can't look away from. Bravo, Mr. Cameron!"

","Aliens is the most pulse-pounding, white-knuckle cinematic experience you'll likely ever have. Not that his already gargantuan ego needs a boost, but the reason why James Cameron is indisputably the greatest action director out there is because he's perfectly meticulous at turning his characters into actual humans. He's not afraid to turn what could have easily been a mere quick-buck 90-minute noise machine into a complex 150-minute epic that yields plenty of time for character development and motivational intrigue to gradually build up into rip-roaring action.<br/><br/>Weaver, of course, is back to reprise her iconic role (which was originally written for a man). There has never been a character like Ripley, and the script here makes her fully multidimensional.<br/><br/>Thrilling from the get go, Aliens is capped by a deliciously tense and hugely gratifying extended finale -- too bad Alien 3 squandered all of it."
"towt","10","1","2","30 December 2007"," The best movie in the Alien series thus far
","This film, was EXCELLENT. If you have seen Alien3 or Alien 4 (Resurrection), and didn't like them, you have to see this one. By far the best one in the series. I have watched this film over and over again and I never get tired of it. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role and she downright kicks butt.<br/><br/>*Spoilers below* Personally, I wouldn't want to go back to LP-426 and face those creatures again, but that would make for a dull movie with a mere cameo of Sigourney Weaver just for plot. She does an excellent job. <br/><br/>The one thing I would change if I could would be to only off some of the lesser known marines when they battle in the hive, saving all the ones you know by name until later. But it is effective, you get attached to some of them, and watch them all die in an instant.<br/><br/>Now why the aliens would choose the atmosphere processor for the hive I have no idea. Since it was automated, there should be very few people there. I would think they would create the nest in a basement of the living complex somewhere.<br/><br/>And, when an alien kills the pilot of the first drop ship, why on earth did they set down on the surface. Especially with the ramp open! They should have dropped the APC and went back to the Sulaco. Still, a good movie, I HIGHLY recommend it."
"canucks_88","8","1","2","4 October 2007"," Masterpiece by James Cameron
","Just about everything about this movie; the cast, action, suspense, special effects, storyline, was just as good if not better than Alien. This was an overall tremendous effort by James Cameron. The only area where I thought this film lacked was in suspense. Don't get me wrong, there are certain scenes that will truly give you goose bumps, but overall there isn't that same eerie feeling as the first film. In ""Alien"", there was just one alien, and you didn't know where and when it was going to show up. In Aliens, there is a whole army of these gruesome E.T.'s, almost to the point of overkill. Also, after watching the first film, we know what these Aliens look like and are capable of. Still, this film is a classic that combines the best of the sci-fi/horror/action genres."
"gavin6942","9","1","2","28 August 2007"," A Sequel Worthy of the Original
","Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) returns to her base, only to find she's been asleep for many decades, and her daughter is now dead. She tells the story of the alien, is not believed, but is called into service again once the aliens she spoke of coincidentally become known. (We might ask how they are found almost exactly the same time she notifies them of the aliens rather than years prior or years later, but let's not get picky.) There are now more aliens, including a swarm of full-sized ones (not just the single one from ""Alien""). And the queen! Holy cow! And, of course, they have to go deep into the hive to stop the aliens from hurting the colonists (although, in all fairness, I think the aliens were there first).<br/><br/>How often does a sequel really compare to the original? Other than with ""The Godfather Part Two"", I can only think of one example: ""Aliens"". The general idea is the same as the first film: group of stranded space explorers attacked by aliens must survive. The difference: more aliens, better cast and better technology (using forklifts to kill aliens is awesome).<br/><br/>I have to give a shout-out to Carrie Henn, who played the young Rebecca ""Newt"" Jorden. She was amazing, and I really wish she would have continued acting. I hear she's now 31 and teaching in California or something, having never made another film. This is too bad, as she really tied the picture together. I don't know if Ripley needed a daughter figure to replace her dead daughter (this seems very contrived), but it worked.<br/><br/>Lance Henriksen appears as Bishop, probably his best role. In the future, Henriksen sells out and appears in every straight-to-video horror film he can get a part in, but back in 1986 this was a break-through role for him. Forget Data from ""Star Trek"" (as cool as Brent Spiner is), Lance Henriksen's Bishop is king. Bill Paxton is also great as Private Hudson, with the immortal ""Game over, man"" line. Maybe not Paxton's best role (he's also great in ""Weird Science"" and ""Twister"", you know) and he is a bit whiny at times, but he's a welcome addition to the cast.<br/><br/>As for Paul Reiser, forget that guy. He's only good for co-starring alongside ugly women (here and in ""mad About You""). His character of Carter Burke is so typical of lawyers. I prefer the lawyer from ""Jurassic Park"". But hey, that's just me. At least it's not Billy Crystal.<br/><br/>There is an ""illegal alien"" joke i found in poor taste, not because I was offended, but because I assume that in the future the concept of ""illegal alien"" will have no more meaning.<br/><br/>Overall, just as good as the first. It runs a bit long with the director's cut (two hours and thirty-seven minutes) but was really enjoyable. The guy I watched it with -- Brandon -- was ready to rent ""Alien 3"", but Family Video doesn't carry it. What a scam, eh? But anyway, check this one out -- you know coming from James Cameron (""The Abyss"", ""Terminator II"") it has to be good. Only Cameron could have succeeded Ridley Scott (and bring Michael Biehn with him), and he does it well."

","I just gave myself a treat and watched this movie again for the first time in years, and I am so impressed by how wonderfully entertaining it still is. Say what you will about James Cameron but the man knows how to tell a story! We're still reading Beowulf a thousand years after it was written, and I like to think we'll still be enjoying Aliens a thousand years from now. The movie is perfectly cast and the story unfolds just right, so that the tension and excitement build until you feel like you're on a really well made roller coaster, with a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. And frankly, I have yet to see CG effects that are a match for Stan Winston's genius in this film. Never did I think the aliens looked fake or animated (ok, some of the ships were a little too obviously models) as is so often the case with the all-too-perfect digital creature effects we see in movies these days. CG has yet to produce images that really seem to have convincing weight and heft and sheer size to them. Give me that big old gorgeous Alien Queen any day!"
"jedekai","10","1","2","3 November 2006"," One of my favorite movies of all time, and the greatest film of the past 20 years.
","""Aliens"" is one of the greatest movies that has ever been made. Whereas ""Alien"" was a foray into the decay of sanity and the crushing sense of doom and the oppression of fear; ""Aliens"" is one of the most obvious statements made on what is the difference between man and monster? The Marines in the film are not there to dawdle and wait in fear. They are there to do what Marines, or any elite fighting force is intended to do; kill. Ripley returns from the original and her actions and decisions ask the question, ""Which is it you want: Redemption for yourself or revenge for those the creatures have killed?"" The businessman from ""The Company"" is only there to care about two things; himself and The Bottom Line.<br/><br/>The story is phenomenal, almost a Sergio Leone's revenge yarn crossed with the sense of claustrophobia and dread of an H.P. Lovecraft or Robert Bloch story, finally given a healthy dose of the eye-candy and action filmography and dialog that made James Cameron a legend. But the greatest aspect of this film is what makes it come alive and makes it unlike any other science fiction movie you will ever see; the details look real. The scuffs on the floor. The marred and used look of all the machinery, the fact that life on other planets is not glass domes and synthetic lawns, but a hard-pressed lifestyle. But above all else, the fact that everything looks pretty much the same. The uniforms on the Marines look like equipment that is in use today, no ""uber-soldat"" mechanized war suits or Anime-esquire giant robots with massive arsenals - just people with armor and weaponry sent less as Marines and more as an insect extermination force.<br/><br/>All through it, the viewer will have shock and horror and, especially in the hallway scene, (and that's all I'll say about it) a sense of pure and undeniable hatred and revenge and then you question: ""Which is worse? Us or them?"" ""Aliens"" belongs on the shelf of anyone who loves movies, primarily due to it's accomplishment that no other action movie can state; the story is better than the stunts and battles. In this movie, that is a legendary achievement."

","Aliens ***1/2<br/><br/>Aliens is the successful sequel to the classic 1979 Gothic horror film Alien. The plot in this movie I have to say is one of the best plots in movie sequel history. The planet where the first Alien came from is colonized and instead of being one Alien, there are more, thus the title Aliens. Now the real question is, is Aliens better than Alien? Some people agree it is but the majority say the Alien was better and I have to agree. Alien was a great Gothic horror while Aliens is an action film. But is Aliens also a Gothic horror film? Yes, in a way but the action quickly takes over. People have said however the reason why Aliens is way better than Alien is because there is more then one alien so the character have nowhere to run. That maybe true but the fact that Aliens has so many aliens makes the option of guessing where they are going to strike from widely open and that is not an element of a horror film. The fact that Alien only had the one Alien made the opinion a lot narrow and it kept you guessing the whole entire time where the alien was going to be at which is a classic element of a monster movie and a horror movie. Aliens is a great action film but I just can't give four stars."

","Most people have probably heard how the second one continues the story but takes a little bit different direction: the first one was a horror movie and the second one was more of an action flick. Well, you'd better believe that they go all out. The story picks up fifty-seven years after the original, and sure enough, there are more aliens. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), however, is not to be deterred. If those drooling fiends are around, she's ready to take them on.<br/><br/>I should say that the movie seems a little silly at times. Since this is an action flick, there are a number of army types, and they all have their macho lingo. Fortunately, ""Aliens"" doesn't pretend to be anything but an action flick. If anything, the little girl adds a sort of humanizing aspect to the kick-ass stuff. But this is definitely a guy movie, albeit one carried by a woman. If I may say so, Weaver becomes as much of a bad-ass here as she was in ""Ghost Busters"" (of course, this time she's not possessed).<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie has something for everyone, and you're sure to like it.

","I think that others have commented here about this movie, so I doubt that I'll be adding anything new.

It's not fisticuff type action or people falling from tall buildings and catching on at the last minute type action.<br/><br/>This is suspenseful type action, with guns and fighting, but also with aliens and imaginary aliens, bad guys you don't expect at all, and scenes that cause you to grip your chair until all of the blood has left your hands entirely.<br/><br/>The special effects for this movie are off the scale, being just as good today as they were when they were first displayed on movie screens some time ago. You get so immersed into the movie and the special effects don't in any way cause you to think that your watching something of fiction. It's like they have a vision of the future and they are showing you that vision in stark reality.<br/><br/>The interaction between characters gives you such a great feel for who they are in the short period of time that you see them. The actors, from the main stars who have shown their skills to us in past movies to those that are relative unknowns, are all true artists. They give you no reason to believe that they are anyone but who they are portraying.<br/><br/>The one liners and humorous interaction between some of the characters helps in some areas to ease the tension, and to set you up for the surprises later.<br/><br/>Wow, if you have never seen this movie, see it, the movie is truly awesome."
"jdslildeb","10","1","2","4 September 2006"," Excellent Special Effects means NO CGI!
","I really love James Cameron because he is truly a consummate artist, first and foremost. He is sensitive and perfection-seeking about all the right things and for all the right reasons as a director; to convincingly tell a good story and to create the human connection with the audience. He really wants the viewer to be transported by his films, which is exactly what a truly brilliant film does. Although this is a ""Sci-Fi"" film, he doesn't ""blind us with science."" Rather he chooses to give only important information at key points to move the story along. The viewer is never overwhelmed with too much information and the pacing never slows down trying to educate the audience about some heady scientific theory. I am so glad that he decided to make this film in the era that he did, B.C., (before computer generated special effects), because I think that is what really makes everything that much more visceral an experience when watching this film. The aliens are flesh and blood, (even if their blood is acidic!), and must be confronted on the material plane. I'm certain that these creatures would not be nearly as scary in CGI as they are in this film, dripping their goo everywhere. Well, case in point, Aliens 3. What a horrific flop and a total waste of everything, paper, film, time, money, talent,...ad infinitum. I actually walked out of the theater 20 minutes into that film and have since never watched it, even though it is included in the box set that I own. In my mind, it is so sub-par that I won't even acknowledge it as part of the franchise. But, then again, I don't like David Finchner's work in general. Enough said,... I have the ""Quadrilogy"" Collection of all the Alien films which includes excellent special features, such as behind-the-scenes peeks at how everything was crafted; sets, props, and aliens. It was really awesome to see how they built the sets and created the special effects! Any, no ALL film students should check out these special features on both this film and Ridley Scott's seminal Alien, which is the foundation work for Cameron's explosive sequel. You can see how Cameron identified the key elements and the core of Scott's film, ie., the physical and motivational qualities of the alien species, the overall condition of life for working-class humans, the corruption of ""the company"" that they work for, and the basic introduction of Ripley's character as sole survivor of the initial encounter with the alien. He then just found a viable continuation of this story within these established parameters. It was a very logical progression, both dramatically and thematically. And even though H.R.Giger was not an art design consultant for Aliens, Cameron already understood what Giger had set up in Alien and used it as a template to draw ideas from for the sequel for his creatures. He had his costume designers base their suits on the original. But Cameron himself was the designer of the queen. Yep! He drew a really creepy, but skillfully drawn, picture of her himself. The man is just oozing talent! I'm so glad he decided to have her constructed to be as terrifying and ""believable"" as possible. She was and is the Queen of All Monsters. ""Real"" monsters rule! It is really hard to believe that this movie was made for a mere 18 million dollars! Put that in your pipe and smoke it, George Lucas. This is definitely a ""must see"" for anyone who likes action, monsters, drama, war stories, and science fiction. You really can't get much better than this."

Great story, surrounded by great characters, along with some terrific and exciting action sequences. Aliens is the greatest sci-fi film ever made. Forget the Star Wars films, those films aren't serious enough and too goofy. This is a serious film, even though one of the characters is so damn funny. His character however, is not supposed to be funny. It just naturally comes out. What I love about this film is the Vietnam type feel. Marines with weapons raised, walking carefully through one corridor after another in search of some type of alien life form. It's reminiscent of Vietnam movies, of solders trudging through the dense jungles of Vietnam in search of the enemy. It's thrilling stuff. I love how the Marines are so bad ass. High tech weaponry, attitudes, but yet feelings of panic. Just like the jungles of Vietnam. The movie written by James Cameron, shells out some really memorable characters, who aren't just for background. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Hudson (Bill Paxton), and Hicks (Micheal Biehn) are very sincere characters who are the heart and soul of this film. Also the other characters are well written. Nobody bores you in this movie, and there isn't a cardboard character in this film. The Predator films are typically Alien films that take place during present day and films that are horribly written to. I recommend this film to anybody. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this. Just a fan of cinema. I'm going to buy the DVD of this film right now. Aliens kicks ass!"

While not overtly complex the story has a way of slowly unfolding new layers of terror upon these marines until it drowns them in the surrounding horror, leaving them no obvious escape.<br/><br/>The monsters of the title also make for some frightening opposition either slowly climbing through ventilation shafts or going on unstoppable all out assaults, their humanized intelligence and organization only compounding on the unescapable situation of these men and women.<br/><br/>In short here is an action film that never loses its pace, sets an awesomely tense atmosphere, gives you plenty of juicy characters to feast on plus great monsters and action sequences around every corner to keep you more than satisfied.

"tommybone17","10","1","2","8 June 2006"," The essential ""run-n-gun"" action movie with smarts and edge of your seat thrills from beginning to end.
","""Aliens"", when looking at its content before viewing the movie, certainly seems like a Hollywoodized attempt to cash in on the popularity of Ridley Scott's classic, ""Alien"", but to my surprise, it actually succeeds the original. Yes, ""Alien"" is a straight-up sci-fi horror flick, and ""Aliens"" is a typical sci-fi action ""run-n-gun"" extravaganza based on the creatures found in the original, but there's something about ""Aliens"" that seems to put all of the necessary scares and thrills made famous from the first one, then added much more tension and excitement than the first film can ever hope to achieve. Instead of facing one alien, Ellen Ripley (the main protagonist from the first ""Alien"", played wonderfully by Sigourney Weaver in one of her best roles) and a group of outer-space mercenaries faces off against an army of them! It made even more tension-filled thanks to James Cameron's excellent direction. This is what an action movie should be, so all directors taking on a high explosive action movie should take notes from James Cameron's ""Aliens"". OK, but many would be asking ""Why would some action movie ranks with the likes of classic movies, such as ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"", and even ""Saving Private Ryan"" to name a few. Well, I have an explanation about that. In theory, ""Aliens"" is a typical what I would call ""run-n-gun"" action movie affair such as any typical Michael Bay movie, and since it deals with creatures attacking humans, it would be logical that it can be compared with rather superfluous creature features such as ""Deep Blue Sea"", ""Jeepers Creepers"", and ""Congo"". But that was what separate ""Aliens"" from the rest, in that unlike the others, this one has a story that is well connected to the characters' motives and that it is actually worth paying attention to. For example, Ellen Ripley isn't just some one-woman army that is typical of any heroic action movies, she actually have the motives and realistic tendencies to really give herself a strong presence throughout the entire film. Sigourney Weaver pulled out a surprise by being nominated for Best Actress of 1986 at the Oscars for a role that really shouldn't. After watching it, you would be surprise by how strong of a performance she really delivered. Unlike the first ""Alien"", in which she practically runs away from the creature, in this film you'll see how she must conquer her fears of the creatures in order to save an innocent little girl (played by Carrie Henn) from an alien infested space colony. To put it bluntly, this movies proves why the character of Ellen Ripley is among the greatest movie heroine in cinema history, and Sigourney Weaver will forever be immortalized as the character. The alien creatures themselves are some of the most terrifying, and thanks to the wonderful puppetry, the creatures gives an organic feel that makes them come alive, and gives the film much more tension-filled moments based on the design of the creatures. One little thing of particular notice is the astounding film and sound editing. Since the aliens wouldn't deliver a promising threat to the mercenaries based on presence alone, the film editing gives it a sense of real danger and thrill that would, in my opinion, ruin the movie in the hand of a less talented film editor. In other word, the film would be half as successful if it weren't for the smart editing techniques. And the sounds emitted by the aliens and the surrounding environment gives the abandoned setting a more menacing and terrifying place to visit, which are excellent additions to keep the tension up. The music, while not extraordinarily memorable as say ""Star Wars"", brings the tension package together with grace, since the music adds so much to the terror and dismay in the movie, a great way to bring out the heart-stopping moments throughout the film (and there are tons, with most of them being the most memorable in cinema history in my opinion). And, although I've stated it before, it wouldn't be as great as it is without James Cameron. James Cameron had made a masterpiece with ""Aliens"", in which he took the basic monster ""run-n-gun"" thriller and took it not just to the next level, but also with great balance. There's no overabundance of mindless shooting (although there are plenty to consider the movie a ""run-n-gun"" affair) and, believe it or not, the characters do not play second-fiddle to the action itself. Although some of the mercenaries wouldn't require deep characterizations, Ellen Ripley and her exploit in the abandoned outer-space human colony makes the already tension-filled atmosphere the more tension-filled. James Cameron demonstrated the perfect action movie in my opinion, and thanks to the atmosphere set by Ridley Scott's ""Alien"", this one bring a whole lot more to the table, making the Ellen Ripley battle with the aliens a whole lot more satisfying than the original. Out of the four ""Alien"" films (not counting ""Alien vs. Predator""), this one is definitely the best. Not just the best in the series, but one of the best in cinema as a whole, in my opinion. There just isn't any other movie that delivers this much thrill, terror, and pure excitement as ""Aliens"", and it took only James Cameron to make another run-n-gun masterpiece to match up to it (that would be ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day""). Overall, for those who would like to know what movie would deliver in thrills with no bad story bogging it down and a hero (or heroine) that is not dumbed down by the plot, ""Aliens"" is the answer. The definitive action movie that stills holds up today, and to a degree, one of the best movies ever. A 10/10 would seem only reasonable for an action movie with no noticeable flaw, and it is James Cameron's most superb work in years."
"stream_of_sorrow","10","1","2","30 May 2006"," THE Greatest Action Movie Ever
","I have lost count to the amount of times i have watched this movie. And even after each session...i find myself overblown by the experience of it. Make no mistake, this is the sequel to one of the best sci-fi movies ever made,but i~t takes the alien saga in a completely different direction,this one is action oriented while the first one was more of a suspense movie. Has everyone knows or should know by now,this movie takes place exactly 56 years after the events on alien,and the formerly unknown planet is know a Wayland yutani colony. Ripley is faced with this new reality,and despite her effort to warn the people around her,there is no reason to believe her story...until they lost contact to the colony. And this is where this movie truly begins. Ripley comes back to the planet where this saga began...only this time with a group of marines. You can see that from early performances that the cast was very well selected,after all this is a James Cameron film,so it has to have quality in it. First of all Sigourney Weaver,the main character and one of her best performances ever,the viewer will love her from the start,as she can be so sweet,but ruff at the same time. Strong on the outside,and even more on the inside. Michael Biehn has also an important role. His character has the perfect balance of being a military man,but also a person with feelings and a rational side. In opposition with him we have Paul reiser has the perfect company greedy employee. Then one of my personal favourites,Bill Paxton,and i read this on a user review on this same website ""He truly steals the show"",and i make these my words too. Every scene with him is just phenomenal,a tough guy on the outside,but a very fragile on the inside. He gives a great dose of humour to this action film. The rest of the characters are marine tough guys, simple characters but also here with great performances. Newt is probably one of the greatest characters and most influential to the movies storyline. The way Ripley gets attached to her,and all the complicity they build throughout the movie,makes the audience sensitive,something rare or even unseen in a movie of this nature. The way a woman and a child are trapped in an hostile and alien infested environment,doesn't seem fair at times,and it keeps us holding on to the screen in a powerful way. Then there are the sets,and the overall feeling they transmit. It really seems that the movie is taking place in an alien planet,and the equipments and weapons truly look futuristic,the spaceships are well designed,and the special effects on the aliens are very well done(no cgi here!). The colony complex is very well done,and you actually believe and feel the fear and claustrofoby of the characters. One of the best movies of all time,and even today,20 years after its release,it still manages to stand up on a genre that is overflown my all kinds of good,and bad movies. If you haven't seen this one,stop reading NOW and go buy one of the special edition dvds available everywhere,or buy the complete alien quadriology DVD set. A must seen movie."

","These movies are the best because they capture the very essence of the sci-fi thriller genre. Every movie is each unique in it's own respectful way and offers fans something new and exciting each time you see it. I love it because of the feeling I get in my stomach when I know an Alien is about to attack, like that time the face hugger got locked in with Ripley and Newt in Aliens. I was so frightened for them, just like it's supposed to make you feel. The whole feeling of the movie stays for four installments and that is quite a feat if you think about it. I for one love these movies and anyone who is a sci-fi fan should love it or at least appreciate it's willingness to go the limit, scare you half to death, and keep you bound to your chair with fear!!"
"neomsn","10","1","2","26 April 2006"," Comparison is pointless.
","For many years I have both heard and participated in arguments about which Alien movie is better. The fact of the matter is that Aliens is a good movie. Was it better than the original? That's a tough decision. Was it as scary as the original? Most definitely not. Most of the characters are ones who we wouldn't really dislike watching die. They're in an open environment with equipment built for the extermination of enemies who- although they may not be similar to the aliens we see-are tough.<br/><br/>So the answer is relatively obvious as to which is a better HORROR movie. In the original ALIEN, there was ONE alien which several innocent citizens had to run from, not fight. ALIENS has much more action and certainly great acting from Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn. Although her relationship with Biehn was relatively exaggerated and melodramatic, the friendship between Ripley and ""Newt"" was a smart tweak in the plot, because Ripley was reminded of her daughter, and a close relationship like that gave her the courage shown at the end of the movie and increased the drama of the entire movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the answer is that ALIEN was a better horror film and ALIENS was a better action film. However, that aside, both are excellent movies which are definitely worth seeing and,(depending on who you are) owning.<br/><br/>Here's to you, Ridley Scott."
"weezer_2005","10","1","2","25 April 2006"," Aliens or Alien?
","This is unlike Alien, this is something else...<br/><br/>This movie will simply blow you away, it is full action packed James Cameron. It is something you will love if you loved The Terminator and you will especially love it if you are a fan of James Cameron.<br/><br/>This movie is not like the first Alien film because unlike the tension of the first one, this one has more of a punch rather than a long build up. However, the film does take a while to get going at the beginning but it works well because it is simply explaining the story. There is no need to watch Alien before this movie. I myself watch aliens long before alien and it was actually a great experience. Because then i could go back and watch the first Alien film wondering how Ripley got into the state she is. The night terrors and the manly build. This is typical James Cameron, you will notice this film is almost identical as The Terminator in many many ways. Notice 2 types of killing machines, an alien and artificial intelligence. Then you have 2 strong female characters, both of which go from the average woman to a soldier. The funny thing is, there is even a love story in both too, Sarah Connor with Reese in The Terminator and Ripley with Newt the little girl in this movie.<br/><br/>This is an insanely brilliant movie with thrills and spills (and i do mean spills) which will keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire ride.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this for viewing late at night in the dark.<br/><br/>10/10"
"nycritic","10","1","2","18 February 2006"," Two Mothers of a Different Kind
","So many sequels fail because they re-hash the same story and bring nothing new to the premises. James Cameron, however, decided that instead of going for a more amped-up repetition of the horror in ALIEN, he decided to reverse the situation, constrict the action to almost claustrophobic levels, and show not one but an entire colony of those nasty aliens, complete with a gigantic Queen. ALIENS is not a horror film but an all-out war movie that also manages to show how we as a race are as opportunistic as we can be. Where ALIEN implied the notion that the crew of the Nostromo was only bait to lure this elusive but highly efficient species out for genetic manipulation, ALIENS takes the premise to extreme lengths. Even then it retains credibility since it has become common knowledge how the powers of the world create their own viruses and play God to unsuspecting humans. However, this is not an existential film but a non-stop thrill-ride filled with three fully fleshed out females stealing the light out from their emasculated male counterparts (played by Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen, and Bill Paxton). Newt (Carrie Henn) is the little girl who witness the destruction of her own security, and who regresses to an animal state in order to survive -- she is able to play the aliens game blow by blow even when her death is omniscient at every turn. Ripley, more of an unwilling survivor of the first movie, is now a rage-induced fury of a woman who will stop at nothing to ensure this species never procreates and sustains one of the most memorable (and symbolic) fight sequences against the Queen as both try to save their own daughters -- Ripley her surrogate Newt, the Queen her entire colony. Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldman), though a little under-written here and there, has as of yet been the only female to body slam an alien punch to punch.<br/><br/>Nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Actress for Signourney Weaver, ALIENS is an excellent follow-up to its first movie and one of the best action films of the 80s. It would be followed by David Fincher's much hated but debut film ALIENS 3."
"crazyrabbits","10","1","2","12 February 2006"," One of the best sequels ever...
","Yes, I loved this film. I loved the cinematography, the acting, the plot, the effects...I just loved everything. What really surprised me is that this film explores a whole different side of Ripley's personality, all while retaining the spirit of the original movie. If you haven't seen the film, it goes like this: Ellen Ripley (played with a quiet fury by Sigourney Weaver) is rescued after spending 57 years in cryosleep after the events of Aliens, and is called upon to be an adviser for a group of marines who have to head back to planet from the original film, due to the fact that a colony that was established has stopped transmitting signals to them. And that's all it takes for this tour-de-force to start, and by God, it doesn't stop for anything. The creature effects in the film are amazing (and it's hard to believe that the illusion of hordes of aliens were created with just five prop suits!), and all the actors pull off their roles (especially Weaver, Carrie Henn as the frightened survivor Newt, and Bill Paxton as the wisecracking Hudson). All in all, this is one film you cannot miss.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Pick up this film, but don't bother seeing the third one. Everyone dies anyway, so it's not like you're missing anything."

","When we last saw Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) at the end of the 1979 classic ""Alien"", she was just putting herself into hyper-sleep after dispatching the creature out of the airlock of her lifeboat. This film picks up the story 57 years later when she is picked up by a salvage freighter, and she awakens to discover that she can't get rid of the nightmares that haunt her every night.<br/><br/>After being blacklisted by ""The Company"", she finds herself struggling to get through the days as a power-lift operator, until she is asked to assist a squad of marines to do a search and rescue at new colony outpost on the very planet where all the trouble started - LV426. Hoping it will put a stop to the nightmares, Ripley reluctantly agrees.<br/><br/>Packing enough fire power to level a mountain, the tough marines go in - and soon find themselves overwhelmed by the alien menace....<br/><br/>This is one of the most thrilling science fiction films ever made, and writer/director Cameron has created a sequel that is self-contained and, in my opinion, far superior to the original. This was the first big-budget picture he made after 1984's ""The Terminator"", and Cameron explodes out here with a style and pace that is all his own.<br/><br/>With great characters, innovative effects and some very memorable action sequences - this movie moves you along like a freight-train - and doesn't let you off till the very end.<br/><br/>""How could they cut the power, man?

Where to begin, I think this film has everything, great special effects, great actors and script, even now after 20 years the film looks amazing, to be honest I don't think Hollywood will ever produce an 18 rated film of this calibre, although CGI effects look good there still not as convincing as models or guys in suits, however stupid that sounds! this film follows on where Alien left off but with James Cameron directing it offers a lot more action than Alien, of which I am an admirer but feel it is no where near as good a film as its sequel."
"ravenwood80","10","1","2","21 December 2005"," and it was war.............
","A sequel to a classic sci fi/horror doesn't usually bode well. The director and screen writer usually just use the same formula, if its not broke don't fix it. James Cameron thankfully took a different approach. The first film relied on suspense with one alien on board the ship terrorising the shipmates. This time we have a planet full of aliens, face huggers, a huge queen alien and a group of hardened marines with a never say die attitude. Like Cameron said ""its Vietnam in space"", and he's not wrong. The film is all about action and scaring set pieces. I first managed to watch Aliens in 1988 when i was 8 years old, and ever since that moment it remains one of my favourite movies of all time. Set many years after the first, Ripley has been in hyper sleep floating in space since, The workers of a planet have not been in contact recently, so those in charge have decided that there may be some truth to Ripleys alien story, and send in a team of marines and Ripley. The movie contains many classic scenes ie 'they're in the room' and when Ripley goes back for Newt. Even the picture of Ripley with Newt holding on to her whilst she has a flame thrower in her hands is a part of modern pop culture. I feel sad though as imagine how lucky everyone was within three years either way of Aliens, we had The terminator, Predator, Die Hard, Bloodsport, all these classic action films, now we get nothing that even half compares to these wonderful popcorn munchers"
"james_corck3","10","1","2","4 December 2005"," Best sequel ever made
","I give this movie a 10. But it deserves an 11!!!<br/><br/>When Ridley Scott directed in 1979 the first Alien he had no idea that, a young director called James Cameron, was planing to make his first big feature, The Terminator. After The Terminator came out, he took the control of the Alien sequel. And then he made history. James Cameron took everything from the Ridley movie, and absolutely not copying it, he made his own movie. Not only a really scary, suspense and horror movie, but a great combat, war and action movie, using the ultra-violence and the hyper-realistic special effects for his purpose. He makes the Aliens evolve, he moved from one spooky Alien that moved half-slowly, to many dozens of aliens that move like demons in fire. He gave us the alien nests, full of cocooned human bodies attached to walls and a very powerful chest bursting scene (please kill me!!!) not so gory and pretty much more effective. He gave us creepy corridors, scary spots to hide an entire alien colony, and sense of humor (Bill Paxton is a genius!). And he gave us the best villain ever. The Alien Queen, Mommy alien for friends. She is the beast (I am trying to not use the other B word) that hides behind Ripley's brain, the monster within. That final battle with the power loader and the Queen is not only epic, is an anthology encounter between two females, two mothers, two enemies. Such both brutal and poetic dance of destruction is the best movie moment in the James Cameron career, not even achieved by his Titanic. Such a great Sci Fi movie that will never have a conquer."
"PsyGuy","10","1","2","21 November 2005"," This is my number one favorite movie of all time!!
","This is quite possibly the best movie ever made. This sequel to the the sci-fi horror Alien, has often been referred to as more of a sci-fi action then a horror itself. While there may be some truth to this, this film still has many areas which are quite frightening. It might be better classified as a thriller or suspense though then action. Unlike an action film, this film starts out fairly slowly. Aside from one frightening scene early on, nothing specifically scary or action orientated happens for a rather large portion of the movie. The film relies on the viewers knowledge of the first film to help it build up the tension for the eventual inevitable confrontation.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley, the sole-survivor of the events of the first film is found in cryo sleep 57 years after she escaped the horror of discovering an alien life form dangerous enough to be a threat to the human race if it were ever to find its way to civilization. Instead of her warnings being taken seriously, she is shocked to discover that in her absence, a terraforming colony of families has been established on the very world where her original crew discovered the aliens. She is punished by the ""company"" for her participation in destroying their cargo ship and begins a humdrum new life while dealing with the trauma of her experiences.<br/><br/>When all contact with the colony is lost and she is given the opportunity to redeem herself. The aliens have robbed her of her crew mates, her daughter (who has grown old and died while she drifted around in cryo sleep), and her career. Only she seems to understand the gravity of the threat that they pose. She realizes that the company (who had attempted to get a hold of an alien specimen in the first film) could still be trying to gather a specimen for their research. This combined with her motivation for payback leads her to accept the offer of returning to the now colonized planet to help wipe out the species. It becomes more clear to her during the journey that she is the only person who has not underestimated the hostility of the aliens.<br/><br/>She journeys to the planet with a group of enthusiastic but underwhelmed group of combat marines who believe that they can deal with anything. They are led by an inexperienced lieutenant and have brought along a representative of the company as well as an android. Since an android was partly responsible for the downfall of her first crew (it was ordered to capture and return the alien at the expense of the crew) Ripley feels uneasy about the mission and we see parallels to the events of the first movie. The major difference here is that while the first movie dealt with one alien, it seems likely that they are proceeding to their encounter with well over 100 of these creatures.<br/><br/>The colony is reached and the search for what happened is under way. There is evidence of a fight but no one or no bodies left to find. The evidence that the aliens were responsible begins to pile up and eventually the marines discover where the colonists have ended up. It is at this point that the aliens finally appear and in large numbers. It is also at this point that the film really begins to distinguish itself from the style of its predecessor. What ensues is a battle to survive where the tension is replaced somewhat by the action. Finally (and almost too late) Ripley's concerns are recognized as valid and she finds herself in a position where she must help to lead the marines actions before she becomes just another victim of the aliens.<br/><br/>This movie works incredibly well on many levels. One of the key elements surrounds the strengths of the female character. Part of this is brought to the forefront when one survivor is found (a young girl approximately the age of Ripley's own daughter when last she saw her) I have never before or since seen a movie with such a strong female lead where I found the character so convincing. Weaver who portrayed this character deservedly received an Oscar nomination for the role. The direction is flawless. The payoff when the aliens are finally revealed is worth the anticipation alone. The characters are varied and interesting. Some may seem a little clichéd now but it was more likely that it was movies using this as a template for success which made them a bit clichéd after the fact.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that you only get to watch this for the first time once, but this movie stands up extremely well to repeated viewings. I've been watching it almost once week for years and I never seem to tire of it."
"lathesius","10","1","2","17 October 2005"," One of THE best films ever made.
","It would be very wrong to compare this to Ridley Scott's astounding ALIEN. Although this is a sequel, the two films could not be more different. ALIEN was a terrific sci-fi horror. ALIENS is a tremendous sci-fi ACTON horror.<br/><br/>James Cameron is at his best in this film. He delivers a movie that hooks you right from the beginning until the very end and creates characters who you actually feel for; Hudson, the nervous but tough and sometimes funny soldier, his friend and second in command Hicks, a level headed, strong marine and last but not least, Ripley, the survivor of the first back to face her inner demons. I could go on forever about these and the other characters in this film.<br/><br/>Alien and ALiens are definitely the best in the series, sadly let down slightly bu Alien3 and the rough edged Resurrection. I wont even mention AVP!!!! If you want a film filled with action, suspense topped off with interesting characters and just general fun then look no further. this is truly a classic and remains timeless."
"Pvt_Vasquez87","10","1","2","24 September 2005"," Excellent Film! Unmissable!
","I have seen this film countless times and can't get enough of it! I saw this one before the first because I was a fan of James Cameron and Michael Biehn. You don't really need to see the first film but some things may make more sense if you do! Alien was very much a suspenseful horror film whereas Aliens is going more for the action. If you've seen other James Cameron films then you should know what to expect. It isn't very gory and does have a few scares in it. The script is good with some cracking lines like 'Get away from her you bitch!' and the acting is the best from all of the films. Unlike the other 3 Alien films I feel that you care more about the characters in this one because the performances are much more three-dimensional. Sigourney Weaver gives her best performance as the maternal Ripley as she battles the aliens to protect her surrogate child, Newt. Her Oscar nomination was well deserved. Michael Biehn makes a great hero that you really cheer on and Lance Henriksen appears shifty but is very innocent as the android Bishop. However, my favourite character is the cocky marine Hudson played by Bill Paxton. I know that he isn't a popular character and I even wanted him to die the first time I saw it but he really grows on you. He's the most realistic of the characters.<br/><br/>The director is perfect as usual from a master of the action genre. It is darkly lit so a lot of it is left to your imagination and the trackers really build up the tension. Some of the shots are brilliant like when the aliens are moving through the ceiling.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the sci-fi/action genre and of James Cameron. However, if you do enjoy it and decide to watch Alien 3 I will warn you that you may feel that it's a slap in the face. That's how I felt anyway.<br/><br/>Enjoy!!"
"MinorityReporter","9","1","2","12 September 2005"," Less atmospheric but kicks butt!
","The first Alien film is an undisputed masterpiece and oddly enough so is the second. It happens very rarely that a sequel can maintain the high standards of a first in a series but that is the case with Aliens. Some say that the second is even better than the first. I don't know if I agree but I still think that Aliens is a pretty darn excellent movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron took the original concept and changed it so we wouldn't get yet another sequel that just copied of the first. Ridley Scott's vision was a sci-fi horror picture and it worked beautifully. Cameron's vision is that of a sci-fi action movie that has some of the memorable quotes of all time. Although there are two versions its pretty safe to assume that the one that will be remembered is the director's cut version. It was the version that Cameron intended for us to see and it really is much better than the theatrical version which is too short in my opinion.<br/><br/>As stated previously there are a lot of memorable quotes in the movie like: ""Leave her alone you BITCH"" and ""Hey Hicks. Man, you look just like I feel"" but aside from the excellent quotes the dialog seems a little bit forced but then again Cameron was never really that good at writing dialog. I'm not saying he is as bad as George Lucas but compared to the exceptional dialog of the original Alien film Cameron's just doesn't quite cut it. The dialog is Cameron's best I reckon and it is not really important as it doesn't lessen to quality of the film in any way. He will certainly produce worse dialog in some of his films to come (*cough* Titanic *cough*).<br/><br/>When it comes to the design of the film I can safely say that it looks really, really good. Cameron designed many of the sets by himself and that is something he knows how to do because the sets are brilliant and immensely detailed. Cameron also designed the Alien Queen and she remains to this day his masterpiece when it comes to any form of design. The Queen is both menacing and beautiful and can to a higher degree display ""emotion"" than the regular aliens who have also been altered slightly from the first film. They have become more streamlined and faster. This is probably due to the fact that Aliens is an action movie and therefore we need speed rather than the eerie, smooth motion of the Alien in the first film. In the original Alien you could see the outlines of a human skull underneath the front of the face. Cameron opted not to do this for reasons unknown. I preferred the original design but I still think that the Alien Queen is absolutely brilliant. Kudos to Mr. Cameron.<br/><br/>The story is a good epic one that works fine on many levels. First and foremost we have the revenge motive. Ripley wants to see the aliens dead because of what they did to her crew in the previous film and because she is severely marked by her experiences (e.g. bad dreams and so on). Then off course there is the greedy corporation, Weyland/Yutani, who have their own reasons for sending Ripley and the marines to the planet where the aliens reside. This is the bulk of the story and then there are various sub-plots like Ripley's relationship to Newt and Hicks respectively and the marines' relationships to each other. All in all a good, solid story.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Sigourney Weaver does even better in this film than in the first and she received a well earned Oscar-nomination for her performance as she balances the grief/horror and the hope and optimism of her character extremely well. Michael Biehn does a fine job and there is really nothing more to it. Carrie Henn does an exceptional job for a child actor. She has a fine emotional range and times her dialog pretty well. Only her accent could have been better but then again you can't expect a child to do a proper American accent when she was born and raised in England. The supporting cast is excellent as well and all do fine jobs in bringing their characters to life. Especially Lance Henriksen who is nearly as good an android as Ian Holm was in the original Alien. Pretty much a flawless cast.<br/><br/>All in all Aliens is a worthy sequel and in some ways superior to the first film.<br/><br/>8/10"

Although one or two effects shots with miniatures look a little dated, Aliens (like Alien) stands up to the test of time remarkably well visually.

The military equipment and mode of operations seems realistic as well, though this happens in the future. Everything is believable, though there are many close calls during the action."

","Most of the time...a sequel to a popular movie wouldn't be as good...in this case its not only a better movie than the original but one of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>This movie has all sorts of different character personalities to root for. The wisecracking Hudson, the laid back Hicks, the puzzled Gorman, the bad-ass latina Vazquez, the trigger happy Drake and many more.<br/><br/>Usually in a horror movie you can't wait for the extra's to be killed off to get to the final climax (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc) but in this case the characters were so lovable it was impossible not to go ""aww damn!"" when one of them bought the farm.<br/><br/>The action scenes were intense and the fight at the end was pretty cool in the imagery...two mother figures protecting their young ones.<br/><br/>The only part about the movie I didn't understand was there was a character who has no lines, never seen on camera and that was Wierzbowski...give the guy at least one line or something.<br/><br/>All in all this proved to be an all time classic and with everything one would want in a movie, cept nudity but naked marines doesn;t sound too pleasing.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","James Cameron made his second masterpiece with this, the sequel to Ridley Scott's classic space horror show. Cameron, a director who will always ensure he gets exactly what he wants, extremely talented and ingenious, brought the series in a new direction, keeping much of the tension of the original, but upping the excitement and action.<br/><br/>After Ripley went into hyper-sleep at the end of Alien, hoping that someone would find her floating through space and pick her up, she travelled for over 50 years before being picked up by 'The Company'. She wakes up and tries to come to terms with all that has happened since she was asleep-her daughter grew up and died, 'The Company' has become more interested in the alien she claims to have encountered, and the planet where she found the alien has become a mining colony. During interrogation she tells the suits what happened to her, and expressed the need for someone to investigate the 'alien' planet. They charge her with the destruction of her previous ship. However, when they receive a distress call from the planet, a group of marines is ordered to investigate. Burke, a company Rep persuades Ripley to come along as she is the only one to have encountered an alien, and because her recurring nightmares are stopping her from living her life. We are introduced to each marine, all tough, hardened fighters, seemingly well-equipped for any danger. Arriving on the planet we see that there had been a massive recent battle, and there seem to be no human survivors. When the meet Newt, a lone colonist girl, Ripley becomes attached to her, but an Alien attack wipes out most of the marines. On attempting to flee, their jump ship crashes. The only way out is to bring by remote the 2nd drop-ship and wait, hoping that the aliens will not attack again. They do. And the Queen appears too.<br/><br/>Aliens must surely rank as one of the most exciting movies ever made. At well over 2 hours it is a testament to Cameron, the script-writers and the cast that the pace of the film never slows. Every time the characters think they may have a chance, something happens to make them think otherwise. Everything is giving the most acute detail, from the marines' garb, to the miniature sets and craft designs. The score is militaristic, keeping with the charge and feel of the movie, and the action is very strong and brilliantly edited. The aliens themselves are still terrifying, and The Queen is awesome. The famous power-loader fight scene is excellent, just one of the many highlights. The planet itself is grim and dark, the perfect place for the creatures to be, and the darkness and tight corridors of the colony add to the tension, atmosphere and claustrophobia.<br/><br/>There is a wide range of characters here, each distinct much like the first film. Even if we do not get to see them for very long, we are given a strong impression of their backgrounds because of their own personal dress and dialogue. Every performance is worthy of mention too, and Weaver's performance was definitely worthy of the Oscar. Ripley progresses here, becoming one of the strongest female characters in movie history, learning and adapting with the Marines, but retaining her maternal instincts and disgust for the company. In fact, the fight and chase involving the Queen, Ripley and Newt is almost like custody battle, a fight to see who is the best mother. Burke begins seeming friendly, but of course his interest is in bringing back a specimen. Bishop is a brilliant inclusion remembering Ripley's last encounter with a Droid. Hicks, played by Biehn is an excellent character, strong marine but not an emotionless, stupid grunt. Paxton steals many scenes as Hudson, spitting out some of the film's best dialogue, at times tough and terrified. Henn as Newt is a revelation in her first performance, dealing with the script and content perfectly. Vasquez must go down as one of the best cult action characters, equally as strong as any of the men, even if she has a short fuse. Goldstein is very good in the role. Apone as the 'Sarg' is also good, and Gorman begins as a fool but redeems himself later. The rest of the cast are all good, even if most are only their to be killed. With such a good cast, Aliens becomes even better.<br/><br/>This film cannot be praised enough. Although there are those who feel it is inferior to the first because it has more action and supposedly weaker characterisation, it has to be said that the two films are different entities, the first a horror, the second a sci-fi action. Like The Terminator, Cameron puts in many effective scares so that it transcends the genre, becoming something more. Cameron says he wants to return to Sci-Fi. Please make one as good as this.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

","If, perhaps, you found yourself submerged in an abnormally long hyper-sleep for 57 years having just blasted an extremely hostile life form -and an expensive mining ship- into nothingness, you were picked up by pure chance, experienced terrifying and sweat-laden dreams of chest-burster's and were then told you had to go back out to LV-426, where the alien, the heart of your nightmarish world, first made its appearance in TV everywhere, who else would you want watching your back than a team of aggressive, macho and trigger-happy marines? Well, thats what Sigourney Weaver got. Somehow, however, I believe not all of us would be so lucky to have Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton running around after us, dressed in tight army outfits and wielding some very masculine looking pieces of weaponry, hmm? <br/><br/>The members of the marine core Ellen Ripley joins would be a concept of hilarity if only they were not quite so good at their jobs. I, myself, would not find it wise to laugh in the face of a pulse-rifle wielding egotistical marine, or such a butch character as played by a pumped-up Jenette Goldstein, hmm?<br/><br/>With a variety of weapons, from RPG launchers to 'sharp sticks', you can find yourself submerged in such a detailed and thought-out world that you will forget all else for the time being. Even Alien, the beloved prequel to this adrenaline-rushing film, is pushed from our minds as we find ourselves gazing longingly at Michael Biehn displaying leadership through actually leading rather than constant bellowing, as opposed to Al Matthews 'Sgt. Apone' who, it seems, would have developed lip cancer from smoking cigars if the aliens hadn't promptly ended his life.<br/><br/>Well, James Cameron has broken the rule that all sequels never top the original- Aliens, beating Alien, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection by far, is never long gone from my mind these days as I gaze wistfully out the classroom and dream of days when I can get to the Army Cadets and re-enact a few favourite moments with my comrades. With fire-power, stirring emotional moments from Carrie Henn, who enacts 'Newt', a subtle adoration for Ripley from Corporal Hicks and, as ever, the sleazy 'Company' man Carter Birk (Paul Reiser) who seems to think money is more substantial than over a hundred lives he sacrifices for a percentage and one mean mother of an Alien Queen, it is undoubtedly one of the best films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>This time, its war."

","I did and it scared the bejaysus out of me. It was a defining moment in my life, one which sparked my love affair with the horror / sci fi genre.<br/><br/>Everyone knows the ""plot"". After the events of Alien in which a alien life form wipes out her crew, Ripley returns with a tooled up team of badass marines. ""This time Its War"" is the tagline and it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>I believe this is a superior film to the original. There is hardly any exposition compared the the very slow build up in Alien. The action comes thick and fast interspersed by tension on a par with Ridley Scott classic. A lot of what makes this film so cool is the visual feast it supplies. The setting of the Colony is a science fiction nightmare, the weapons and vehicles are instant classics which have been aped and copied endlessly since. The cast are simply brilliant. A movie I would compare it to in this sense is Predator. The squad of soldiers are so likable that you genuinely don't want them to get picked off by the alien horde. The fact that you know they will be makes it so morbidly absorbing.<br/><br/>As for the aliens themselves. I believe they've never looked better in the series then they do here. Its just something about the lighting, the way its shot. Not too much is shown but enough is glimpsed to make them the most terrifying screen aliens of all time. This film really took the baton provided by Alien and cemented the standards for the genre.<br/><br/>An absolute gem of a film. There isn't a bad scene in it and its a film I could watch a million times and never get tired off. Hopefully I'll have enough time to do just that."

","A scary thrill-ride with a big heart and a lot of funny lines. Unlike a lot of movies of its kind, the characters were worth caring about - even the minor ones who got killed off early. <br/><br/>How scary is it? Well, the friend I saw it with actually jumped out of her seat in one scene, throwing her popcorn all over me in the process. <br/><br/>How funny is it? My brother recently quoted Apone at me (""I don't know, is there anything you can do?"") in the middle of a conversation - and it's been 15 years since he last saw the movie. <br/><br/>How dramatic is it? I could name a hundred scenes that gripped me - not just the scary-alien stuff but Ripley's confrontation with the company's people on the space station, her nightmares, even the mood-setting opening scene in which her ship is opened and the dust is swept off her sleeping pod.<br/><br/>How satisfying is it? It is absolutely the ONLY movie I've ever seen that actually made me cheer while watching it."

","""Aliens"" was the movie my wife and I rented for our first date. It's ""our"" movie. But I don't think that this is only the reason I love it so much.<br/><br/>The FX are absolutely stunning. Virtually flawless and basically CGI-free. The attention to detail set a high bar that few other films have matched.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses are excellent in their roles. Weaver is the most prominent, but you gotta love Paxton's portrayal of the smart-aleck Pvt. Hudson, who ultimately goes down in an almost heroic manner, fighting and defiant until the end. Henriksen is also spot-on in what will probably be his defining role as a supporting character.<br/><br/>The script is a masterpiece. Every time I read the ""Quotations"" in the IMDb entry, I just crack up.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and rent or buy the Special Edition and watch it on the biggest screen you can with true 5.1 audio.

"sarastro7","10","1","2","2 January 2005"," Best action movie ever? Yes, it is.
","I know I'm not alone in believing Aliens to be probably the best (sci-fi/) action movie ever made. It may not be artistic per se, but the entertainment value is through the roof. Off the scale. The story is good, the execution is intelligent, the actors and characters are charismatic, and everything about the structure and pacing of the tale is just impeccable. The aliens are successfully and convincingly used as a kind of extra-terrestrial predator more vicious, threatening and deadly than any we know from the real world.<br/><br/>As for the first Alien movie; while it is a supreme work of art and a great achievement, I think the sequel is better. But they're very different movies; one is sophisticated horror, the other is an unashamed sci-fi romp. Alien The 8th Passenger is realistic to an extent perhaps unequaled in any other SF movies, and its spaceship setting is sublimely perfect. Aliens, however, is heroic and hardboiled yet sensitive space action in the manner that other sci-fi/action movies only dream of. All elements are balanced perfectly, and the viewer can engage their emotions in the action over and over. Aliens is the definitive action movie yet produced.<br/><br/>10 out of 10, easily."

","One of the best action films i've ever seen in my opinion. I think they should really remake this film, the marines were so cool. The designing was awesome as were the weapons. Although the first hour can drag if you aren't a fan of the franchise, once the movie gets going you can't help but enjoy it. <br/><br/>You just feel sheer pity as they all get picked off one by one. Personally I think Sig. Weaver should have won the Oscar for this film for the powerful performance as the unfrozen superhero.<br/><br/>This film, although closely rivalled by the first one, is much better than the other two, and i feel that a mjority of people would join me. The general feel of tenseness and suspense is greatly captured in this film."
"artkozak","10","1","2","10 December 2004"," Best Sequel ever!!
","Now, this is probably one, if not my all time favourite movie. I think that if Alien was good Aliens managed to improve the already excellent film. Sigourney is awesome in this movie, and the cast that accompany her is just the perfect match. The aliens which are the true main characters are flawlessly developed and appear in big quantities but without that feeling of being overdone. And the QUEEN is just so incredible that I think I wasn't able to think about anything else after a month. The movie is gripping and it uses at its best the special effects available at the time, which I think are not one bit out of date. The storyline is solid and the dialogs fits all throughout the film. I think this is the one example of a sequel being better than the actual original film, and as I said I think Alien is already and excellent film. So what you waiting for? get Alien and Aliens, and let yourself have the best time of your life. You must see this movie!!!"
"Antagonisten","10","1","2","20 November 2004"," Stunning
","It's always harder for me to comment on the movies i really love, than the movies i didn't even like. Which makes this VERY hard. Aliens is along with Terminator 2 probably the two action films that for me define the genre. And these two also collaborate in making James Cameron, in my eyes, the still undisputed king of action blockbusters. The one man who can have a huge budget and make an action film where every dollar still feels well spent.<br/><br/>The story here is more or less an excuse to reunite the two factors we want to see reunited after the first Alien-movie made in 1979: Ripley and the Alien. Ripley wakes up in the beginning of ""Aliens"", having drifted through space for nearly 60 years after the first movie. Her reports of the alien creature is met with skepticism from ""The Company"", that she used to work for. But something must have stirred, they sent someone out to check on her story. And things begin to happen, they lose contact with a colony and are forced to take the matter seriously. Soon Ripley and some of earths finest marines are heading out to take control of the situation. And this time it's war.<br/><br/>How do you make the perfect action movie? Well, don't ask me. Ask James Cameron! Because this is a close to perfect as we are ever likely to come. The music, the weapons, the vehicles, the characters, the pulse-raising pace, the aliens and last but not least (the ultimate queen of action) Ripley! Everything work together to make this a crushing experience. It's sadly not often you see something like this, something so exhausting you break sweat just by watching it.<br/><br/>Admittedly some of the effects look rather dated today. Especially the scenes of the landing shuttle and the spaceship. But in all honesty it doesn't bother me at all. For what this movie lacks in modern-day CGI it more than makes up for in pure action. It doesn't matter how many well-made CGI-creatures more recent films throw at you, none of them are as menacing or as frightening as H.R. Gigers Alien-monster. And while there was just one creature in the first movie, there are swarms of them here. All closing in on the small group of humans...<br/><br/>So, watch this and prepare for the ride of a lifetime. In the director's cut (which is the version you want to see if possible) it's 154 minutes of pure adrenalin rush. This is probably the only time i will ever do this, but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do: i rate this 10/10."

","This is such a sweet film Directed by JAMES CAMERON it deserves every bit of success and recognition. It equals with its predeccesor, ALIEN ( directed by Ridley Scott ). Its superb camera work and acting and so on, just make this a perfect film.<br/><br/>For its time, this is a masterpiece of directing and has gone down in history for its brilliance. Siqurney Weaver is such a brilliant and versatile actress that she could do any role, put in front of her at any time, and pull it off to be some of the best work anyone has ever done. James Cameron is the same story, I would count him to be one of the best directors in history. Definitely a film to watch......<br/><br/>Paul"
"rosti_mitev","10","1","2","9 August 2004"," Best Sci-Fi ever?
","Aliens! My favourite of the tetralogy of the extraterrestrial species! And one of the best both sci-fi and horror movies I have ever seen! James Cameron really did this movie the way a sci-fi horror movie should look like. The action, the thrill, the fights, the shooting - everything is top class, but the essential part of the movie is the atmosphere and the aliens themselves. The claustrophobic environment, the camera and the light effects make the atmosphere extremely tense and frightening. There are no secondary love story-lines, so popular in other sci-fi movies (like in Godzilla, Armageddon, Independance day), that most often spoil the atmosphere and prevent the viewer from concentrating upon the real fear and action. (Who cares that Will Smith's Character has a dream to fly in open space and the alien invasion made it possible for him to do it!) The battle is what's important!"
"departed07","10","1","2","1 August 2004"," One of the top 1980's horror film ever made; not to mention a grand sequel
","""Aliens"" is by far a more superior sequel than any other film franchise in history. This time, Sigourney Weaver is back to kick some alien butt in a mean way. After being cryogenic frozen for the past 33 years, Ellen Ripley(Weaver) has been risen back and being investigated after the incident aboard the previously ship she was in, which she describes that her crew died because of a grown parasite. Ripley also discovers the company that built the ship her crew died in has a factory in the colony of LV-426 of which people work and live in that facility. With not much time, the creatures attack the colony killing off everybody but a little girl name Newt (Carrie Henn). <br/><br/>Ripley is sent to a military base in outer space where she is armed with heavy commandos carrying heavy firearms with the latest in technology. The team is lead by Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews) and Corp. Hicks (Michael Biehn) in which they must investigate the incident at LV-426 and see what has happened...that is where the fun begins as the aliens come out of nowhere and attack the marines.<br/><br/>With whatever marines are left, it is up to Ripley and the squad to fight the aliens once and for all before they become extinct from the human race. Directed by James Cameron who directed ""The Terminator"" delivers everything you want in a action movie. This is by far the coolest sequel anybody has seen.<br/><br/>The film also co-stars: Bill Paxton, Paul Reiser, Carrie Henn, Jeanette Goldstein, and Lance Hendrickson."
"filmbuff99","10","1","2","22 July 2004"," One of my all-time favourites
","This film has to be the biggest action, visual & special effect, dramatic, sci-fi film ever! It is a big favourite of mine, simply because it exudes so much energy, passion and is better than any theme park roller coaster.<br/><br/>James Cameron is a genius (and good ole' Canadian boy, eh?) by taking a fairly simple story of the sole survivor of the Nostromo in Ridley Scott's Alien and making her a mother figure for the sole survivor of the LV-426 colony. Mix in a great supporting crew of Marines and a mysterious android, awesome visual effects, a heart-thumping score and you have a perfect blockbuster classic.<br/><br/>In case I haven't made myself clear, this film ROCKS (and I haven't even seen it on the big screen)!<br/><br/>10/10 (was there any doubt?)"
"oshram-3","7","1","2","14 July 2004"," Good, but not as great as everyone says
","Certain genre films manage to strike a resonating chord with their audiences, and achieve not only popular success but a lingering cult that glorifies the movie into neo-scriptural status. 'Blade Runner' is such a film, perhaps the shining example of a genre film that too many people think is better than it really is; but 'Aliens' is another excellent example of a film that people elevate out of proportion to how good it really is.<br/><br/>To be fair, 'Aliens' is a strong film. It has interesting characters, an engaging set-up, and some of the better production design ever seen in a sci-fi film. It's also disturbingly pro-military, which is understandable given its Reagan-era roots, but comes off more than a little hawkish now. And it does achieve what it set out to do, and what most sequels never can; to be as good as or better than the original. Granted, Ridley Scott's 'Alien' was a different type of film, a suspense/horror movie, where this is an action film (and yes, I am aware of parallels to 'Mummy/Mummy Returns').<br/><br/>Watching 'Aliens' now is a different experience than seeing it back then; you have the following two movies in your memory (whether you want them there or not), and it's funny to see Paul Reisler (Carter Burke) doing anything other than watered-down comedy (he's very good here, by the way). The only other really recognizable actor is Sigourney Weaver, whom they unsuccessfully tried to build a franchise around; genre dorks like me can pick out Michael Biehn, whose career essentially peaked with this film, and of course Bill Paxton is in the background crying and bitching.<br/><br/>The film comes off as very eighties when viewed through modern eyes. Burke in particular seems to have gotten stuck in 1985 (though Ripley's civilian garb is also horribly dated). Most of the military production design still holds up, however; ironically it succeeds in that by not being too futuristic. The tanks, dropship, etc, all still look and feel pretty cool.<br/><br/>So why is this film not the be-all end-all that so many proclaim it to be? It's a good film, sure; the build up is particularly tense and effective, and the rough camaraderie between the marines is still enjoyable (though more of them seem to come off as dicks than I remember). The slow approach to the settlers' camp and the way Cameron chooses to unveil the aliens  remember, at that time we didn't all have little plastic dolls of them  is also very inventive, and while this is an action film, Cameron injects a healthy dose of horror into it.<br/><br/>My basic issues with the film (which my recent re-watching did nothing to dispel) really came down to two things: Newt, and Cameron's 'mother' issues. The entire last third of the film, from a plot standpoint, is wholly unnecessary, because of these two items. The characters battle and beat (or at least hold off) the aliens and are well on their way out when, inexplicably, the clever and nimble-fingered Newt falls down an air vent, and we get a long, pointless detour that not only sours this film but mostly poisons the next two and the very concept of the aliens altogether.<br/><br/>Kids are hard to do in genre films. Spielberg did a decent job with Short Round in 'Temple of Doom' and Alex O'Connell in 'Mummy Returns' manages to work well. But most of the other times, including here, kids are just annoying precocious plot devices. Newt doesn't bring anything to this film other than a lot of screaming; she tells us nothing about the aliens we don't learn from other sources, she sheds no light on the colonists, and she isn't even particularly effective comic relief. The only purpose she serves is to introduce the main sub-theme in the movie, Cameron's mother complex. By awakening Ripley's maternal instincts, Newt's presence sets us up for the ridiculous end-duel between Ripley, in a wearable forklift, and the woefully overdone Queen alien, an unnecessary invention that looks silly and cheapens the horror value of the aliens forever.<br/><br/>Viewed with hindsight now, one can see that 'Aliens' could also be called 'T2 version 0.95'. Many similar elements, and even similar shots, are used in both films (compare Vasquez's intro with Sarah Connor's; the misapprehension of the lead character, a non-combatant, upon their first encounter with an android; the role both Newt and John play in re-humanizing their mothers; and so on). There's nothing really wrong with this  and Cameron would hardly be the first director to mine himself for ideas, and, frankly, you could do worse than steal from 'Aliens' for inspiration. But it's interesting to watch Cameron test several ideas out in this movie before fleshing them out in what is arguably his greatest work (come on, you didn't think I was referring to 'Titanic', did you?).<br/><br/>'Aliens' remains an enjoyable and well-done film, if a bit dated, and I know I spent too much time here debunking myth and not enough praising the effective parts of the film, which are numerous. The longer-cut DVD adds nothing that you really missed in the first place (I could have lived without seeing Newt's parents) and imbues the early part of the film with pacing more appropriate for a novel (which probably explains why it was pared down). For sheer genre fun, the first two-thirds of this movie are hard to top, and it's not difficult to see why it has engendered such feverish devotion from genre fans. It's certainly worth a viewing if you haven't seen it recently. By and large the Alien franchise was pretty good ('Alien 3' being the extremely notable exception), and it never gets better than it does here. For most of the picture, anyway."

","What can I say that hasn't already been said by the legion of fans that this movie has? <br/><br/>In short, it all came together for this film. <br/><br/>Do you ever think back to your all-time best film-going experience? This was it for me. I went to see this movie by myself as a matinée in 1986. It was the first R-rated film I ever saw. I remember pretty clearly the feeling I had for the rest of the day (and for a week or so later) after I walked out of the theater. It was a feeling like the rest of life was so... boring and inconsequential... after seeing this movie. Of course, that's how a great action film should make you feel, and I now realize that I had developed a huge crush on Sigourney Weaver too. She definitely deserved to win the Best Actress Oscar for this role.<br/><br/>In a movie with so many great lines, let me share one that I repeat from from time to time, to no one in particular, when a situation is going from bad to worse: ""DRAKE, WE ARE *LEAVING*!"" <br/><br/>Anyway, if you haven't seen the film and are a sci-fi, horror, or action fan, stop reading this and go rent the director's cut.

","For all the rock 'em, sock 'em action that other reviewers heap love on James Cameron's Aliens over the original Ridley Scott version, I still prefer the haunting tension of the original Alien (1979). Aliens is simply really all non-stop action (extremely entertaining nonetheless!); that's what some prefer. The tension and the unknown in Alien gets you really scared.... And I prefer the original. (BTW, don't watch the further sequels, they are simply hollow Hollywood attempts to rake in money on the Alien series name.) Cameron's Aliens is still exciting and worth the roller coaster trip. (Bill Paxton is quite entertainingly over the top as a whining Marine. )<br/><br/>Ridley Scott's Alien plays havoc with your mind. Still giving Aliens a strong 7; Alien gets a 9."

","Well what can I say, James Cameron has truly done an excellent job of turning Ridley Scott's horror classic, Alien, into a high voltage action thriller! This amazing sequel has everything, and I mean everything that a movie fan would want to see in a movie. First of all, there are amazing performances from an all-star cast lead by Sigourney Weaver, who by the way was nominated for best actress for this movie. Second of all, the visual effects are suberb even by today's standards, and lastly this movie is great because it is directed by James Cameron. I mean who's better to direct a science-fiction action movie other than James Cameron (he certainly proved himself in this movie and in the Terminator movies). Just like in The Terminator, James has succeeded in making a wonderful movie! Of course James did have a little help from his friends to make this movie. Stan Winston has done an equally good job of designing the acid-spitting monsters in this movie, the aliens. Above all else, this movie rocks because it has the one, the only Queen Alien in it. The Queen Alien is even more terrorfying than the other alien drones, she is one big egg-laying machine! By the way, this is the one with the awesome fight between Ripley and the Queen Alien! So the bottom line is; go see Aliens and I bet you that you'll be hooked on this epic movie forever!"

","I am Barry G. and for those of you who don't already know, I am a huge , and I mean huge fan of the epic ""Alien"" movies series. So read my review and then see the movie! James Cameron has done an excellent job of turning Ridley Scott's horror classic ,""Alien"", into an edge of your seat thriller! In this sequel, Ripley, who survived her encounter with the alien in the original, is found floating in space by a deep salvage team. Later, Ripley is brought before a court and questioned as to why she destroyed the ship the Nostromo in the first film. Ripley tells her story to the court, however, the court does not believe her story about the acid-spitting alien, and further more decrees her unfit to hold a license as a Warrent Officer. The court does start to believe Ripley's story though, after they lose contact with colonists on the planet where the alien is from. They tell Ripley to go to the planet with marines to see what is wrong on the planet, and in return they promise to give back Ripley her Warrent Officer license. She decides to accompany the marines to the planet and the rest is movie history! This is a great sequel that is better than all of the other ""Alien"" movie sequels.<br/><br/>I, as well as many other movie critics, agree that Aliens is a sequel that is different from, but equal to the original. Once you see this movie you'll be hooked on it as well as all the other ""Alien"" movies in this terrific series. By the way, this is the one where Ripley has a daring fight with the Queen Alien in one of the most famous scenes in movie history!"

","As far as sequels go this is up with the best. The first film in the became known as one of the scariest films ever made and repeating such suspense and horror would be almost impossible. Enter James Cameron. He not only brought back the suspense of the original, but also threw in plenty of explosive action!<br/><br/>The story starts with Ripley being found 57 years after detonating the Nostromo. She has her Officer's License revoked and can only get it back if she helps investigate a human colony with which contact has been mysteriously lost. The kicker is that the colony is located on the planet where the Nostromo's crew found the egg chamber...<br/><br/>The resulting film is equal too, although different from the original with the focus being on loud machine gun battles and explosions rather than slowly creeping terror, but it all works out great. 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R: violence/gore and profanity"

","One of the most intense and outrageously astounding films I have ever seen in my life all in a matter of Sci-fi, horror, action, drama, and the incredible bond between all the characters.  Cameron out-did himself by a long shot in making this movie. He really pulled it off in surpassing it's predecessor.<br/><br/>The aliens were that much more awesome and everyone made an amazing performance.  Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jennifer Goldstein, Carrie Henn, and the BAD-ASS Sigourney Weaver!  An incredible actress and one of the strongest heroines of all time.  A woman who can rip s*** like noone's business and still stay gentle at heart.  Her bond and relationship with Newt is beautiful and emotionally awesome.<br/><br/>Cameron brought a whole new side to Ripley when he wrote in the character of Newt.  Even at the end of the movie when Newt reaches to Ripley she says ""Mommy!""  Ripley really loved her like her own child and would not let her go.  I fell even more in love with Weaver's performance afterward.<br/><br/>Not to mention this movie is loaded with tons of classic lines that I still recite to myself because they're so clever!  ""Guess she don't like the corn bread either.""  ""It doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.""  ""I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.""  ""LET'S ROCK!!!"" ""And you, you little s*** head, you're staying here.""  ""This bulls*** that you think is so important, you can just kiss all that good-bye!""  ""I knew you'd come...""  ""C'MON GOD DAMMIT!!!""  ""Get away from her you BITCH!"" This line is definitely my most favorite of them all and always will be!<br/><br/>As for the music, most inspiring and emotionally powerful.  Especially the song used at the end of the original theatrical trailer.  Awwww!!!  I can't help but give an evil smile and get goosebumps every time I hear that song! Even the opening theme kicked ass.<br/><br/>So there you have it!  Aliens defines the best of the best in sci-fi and the Alien saga all-together.  Aliens will always remain my favorite no matter what anyone says.  And if you haven't seen this yet then you don't know what you're missing.  You will NOT be disappointed!  Even if you don't like sci-fi you'll have a blast.  It's a total blow-away!<br/><br/>SHEER PERFECTION!!! 9/10"
"Manthorpe","10","1","2","12 February 2004"," Hold on to your butts...
","Ripley has been floating in space in hyper sleep for 57 years since her last encounter with the alien, and has been luckily picked up by a deep salvage team. The planet that the aliens inhabit, LV426, is now the site of a large community of terra-formers who have set up an atmosphere processor on the lonely planet to get it ready for colonization. Little do they know who their neighbors are. When ""the company"" loses contact with the colony, they send Ripley in with a team of Colonial Space Marines to investigate. All out hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers:<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is without a doubt one of the best sequels ever made, and action movies period, which achieves it's success by taking the story in a different direction instead of remaking what's already been done before. James Cameron also adds his own additions to the story which make it even better. Cameron has proven over time that he is the only director worthy of being passed the torch of the Alien saga and that he is one of the very best directors for action films, if not the best. For many people including myself, this film is the conclusion of the Alien series, and I don't think I need to explain why.<br/><br/>What we've got here is the same grotesque alien species we had in the first film, except there's a veritable army of the damn things led by an ultimately powerful Queen alien. We get to see how the aliens actually live, which is quite similar to an ant or termite colony, and find out how the facehuggers and eggs come about. Kudos to whoever designed the hive and the Queen. I know they were both inspired by Geiger, but I'm unsure if he was involved directly.<br/><br/>I personally prefer the group of characters in this film as opposed to the previous one, but that may be because I think Michael Biehn's role as Corporal Hicks is such a standout. The guy was born to play a badass and does it with ease. Lance Henrickson as Bishop is also another noteworthy performance in which he portrays the dubious android. Paul Reiser is typically annoying in every sense, but that is his role here so it's not a bad point. Hudson (Paxton) and Vasquez are also enjoyable characters that get a few laughs going. Overall, a terrific cast.<br/><br/>While Scott's ""Alien"" was more of a tension filled terror fest, meant to keep you on the edge of your seat with fear of the unknown and lurking danger, ""Aliens"" creates the same type and level of tension through incredible action sequences. I feel both are equal as far as entertainment goes, although they take entirely different approaches. ""Alien"" probably had more of an impact when it came out because nothing like it had ever been done before. However, I feel that ""Aliens"" does the same thing in the action department, and without being unrealistic like a lot of it's rivals in the same genre. Cameron's perfectionist style and attitude towards his work is all too realized here. The lighting is perfect, camera work is amazingly done, and the general mood and pace of the movie are controlled very well. There were some parts that were filmed in reverse to get a better effect, which is quite impressive in it's own right. He also succeeded in getting that spooky atmosphere just right as well that Scott had so carefully created.<br/><br/>The story itself lets Ripley develop into a shade of a different character with the introduction of Newt, allowing her to develop some maternal instincts which she was devoid of in the first film. She once had a child, but hyper slept through her entire life and now has a second shot at being a mother again. This plays a huge part in her motivation and determination for becoming the badass with two guns, who delves almost fearlessly into the depths of the hive to save Newt. Weaver becomes the epitome of a movie heroine here, and I have yet to see her equal. This scene leads up to the face off of the two mothers and climax of the film. The classic and mother of all showdowns, coincidentally between two mothers. We have the alien mother, the Queen, fighting to save her eggs and brood against Ripley, who is fighting as a mother to save Newt's life. When Ripley torches most of the eggs, the Queen is now out for blood and vengeance. It all comes down to one of the coolest battles in movie history...Ripley in the power loader vs. the Queen alien. It will be hard for any action movie to ever compete with `Aliens', and it will be recognized as a landmark in cinema for some time for it's sheer brilliance, but not just for the action because this movie has more than that. There is only one other `action' movie in my mind that can stand close, which is Terminator 2, also from Cameron. If I had to pick, I'd chose `Aliens'. I can't see how anyone who likes sci-fi or action could not love this film. As good as it is and no matter how much I like it, this movie never would have become what it did had it not been for Ridley Scott's creation to build upon. I consider myself fairly discerning when it comes to action, but honestly I can't say anything bad about this film.<br/><br/>With that said, this is easily in my Top 10 of all time.<br/><br/>`Game over man, Game OVER!'"
"fibreoptic","10","1","2","15 February 2004"," One of the best movies ever.
","This movie simply rocks. I think it was unfair of Cameron to make an Alien movie this great because it's a hard movie to follow up as the next two Alien movies prove. James Cameron knows what makes a great movie, it's like he's a movie fan more than a director because he knows what we want. Instead of having a few Aliens which would have been acceptable (because the first one had only one) we get treated to hundreds of aliens and marines with lots of guns! If i had it my way the guy would be writing and directing every sci-fi movie on the planet! Brilliant! 10/10"
"Triggerhappy-86","10","1","2","2 February 2004"," ""This time it's.....a good sequel!""
","1986 - A great year in my view. I was born! The Transformers had a film released and of course...Aliens. But, what's so special about ""Aliens""? Well, for a start, it's a sequel to one of greatest Sci-Fi films ever created - Alien. When released in 1979, Alien pushed the boundaries for Science-Fiction films to their very limits (well, for 1979 anyway). However, James Cameron would push them further still merely seven years later when he released Aliens.<br/><br/>Being a sequel of course, Aliens had a lot to live up to...and boy did it ever! Once again, Sigourney Weaver returns to reprise her role as the Gung-Ho action heroine - Ellen Ripley. This time Ripley means business, by helping a team of Colonial Marines (led by William Hope's It's-my-first-day! Lt. Gorman) to return to the now-colonised planet of walking nightmares. Weaver again plays the role spot-on, not quite the damsel in distress yet not quite the Kick-Ass ""Take you all on"" heroine. Weaver also plays Ripley's kind, loving side during the scenes with Carrie Henn's Newt, with the kind of warmth you'd expect from somebody who's lost everything and has been classified as ""unstable"". The rest of the cast are spot on too, from Hope's useless Lieutenant to Bill Paxton's superbly well-acted wuss, Hudson. In fact, Hudson is one of the greatest characters created for any film. Macho and invincible whilst on the Sulaco and the Drop ship, Hudson generally provides the film with comedy back-up - Even more apparent when, after a slight hiccup and a few deaths, Hudson turns into a gibbering wreck, the complete opposite from what we seen thirty minutes beforehand! Hudson provides the relief from the full-out shooting that compromises the Marines landing on the planet...let's face it, to have a character shouting ""Game over man, Game over!"" after witnessing his friends get mutilated and devoured in horrible ways is the epitome of sheer genius script-writing. Cameron does a great job of directing this film. The action scene's are spot on, the acting and dialogue is spoken in perfect timing and the camera never fails to be in the wrong place.<br/><br/>Utter bliss rendered in Movie form. If you haven't seen this yet (and why not?) then you should go out and rent/buy the Special Edition DVD right now! (not the Alien: Quadriolgy box-set, because Alien 3 and Resurrection really ruin the first two film's appeal)<br/><br/>In total, amazing acting, great cast, great action, Superb and memorable dialogue, brilliant script, no ewoks, Characters truly well thought up....what more could you want from a Sci-Fi film!<br/><br/>10/10 ""Check it out! i am the ultimate badass!"""

Once again, James Cameron shows what he is capable of. impressive job from the maker of The Terminator and Abyss. The actors are also great; Sigourney Weaver remakes his role as Ellen Ripley, my all time favorite actor Michael Biehn makes a memorable role as corporal Dwayne Hicks, Carrie Henn plays the role of Newt and Lance Henriksen plays the role of synthetic, Bishop. Bill Paxton and Jeannie Goldsmith are also great! Aliens is one of those movies, that never gets me bored and that's because of it's full of fantastic acting and and it has a great plot.

"chromium_tim","10","1","2","1 August 2003"," Cameron RULES
","Possibly the most frightened i have ever been whilst watching a film was when i saw this at the age of 12. I shouldnt really have been watching it but there you go. I remember being absolutely petrified all the way through and the only real piece of gore in the film is where you see a chestburster come out of a crewperson. So that wasnt why i was scared. However i WAS scared because of its unique style in portreying darkness using very moody soundtracks, excellent props and most of all the excellent use of the alien creatures. You dont really get to see the creatures very much as most of the tention built up by them is implied. What Cameron has done here is to coax the viewers great imagination and mould it to the dark visions he and Geiger wanted to represent. It is genius film making due to its faultless plot, great cast and dialogue but most of all because it is a sequel (in my mind better than the first). I have no clue as to what goes on in H R Geigers mind but to create what is essentially the devil (or what it represents - pure evil) i feel is touching the boarder of genius and insanity. The essence of the film found my deepest fears and played with them like a cat does a mouse but instead of it being a nasty experience (as it should have) i felt compelled to watch it even at the age of twelve. I am now the ripe old age of 26 and i have probably seen Aliens more than i have any other - star wars included. At a guess i'd say at least 100 times or more. Call me a nerd but i still do not tire of this fantastic piece of storytelling. I just wish they hadn't ruined what could have been a fantastic ongoing plot featuring an adult Newt, Hicks and Ripley in the third and fourth installments of the genre. Alien 3 was awful and alien 4 was just ghastly. The new 'plot twists' they tried to create were just an insult to the first 2 films. Had they kept it simple and persued the route of the Dark Horse comics (earth is over run by aliens and the story centres on Hicks and Newt) they would have had so much more credibility.<br/><br/>Ultimately i have to say this is my number one favourite film of all time. The darkness, the futility, the pain, the horrifying reality, the disaster and the humanity all added together create the most fantastic visualisation of any horror film i have ever seen. It just cannot be missed. Drink in the darkness people because this is the best (or worst) you will ever see.<br/><br/>A most definite Ten out of Ten"
"EijnarAmadeus","10","1","2","29 July 2003"," One of those situations were the sequel is equally good to the original.
","With Ridley Scott directing ALIEN, who could be a better caretaker for its second, far more action-based outing, than James Cameron? He was the perfect man for the job, and the result is truly, truly magnificent. The movie acts like a full-blown action movie, like a wildcat, every aspect of lurking excitement from the first is here drawn into a slashing blow-'em up setting that's extremely well pulled off. The mixture of horrifying excitement with right-on military marines is a instant feature, and is just as greatly balanced as only Cameron could have achieved. Weaver returns fantastically as the bewildered Ripley as she once again encounters the terrifying creatures from outer space, and although it's a simple fan-question whether you prefer the first or the second, ALIENS has got all of the strengths from the first and puts them effectively into a new, refreshing setting. One of the very finest sequels ever made!"
"roland-sinn","9","1","2","28 July 2003"," Rambo in Space
","I saw Aliens first on the big screen when I was 14. I did like it, yet even as a kid I had a cynical heart. My first reaction after viewing the film was: Aliens is `Rambo in Space'. I also felt strongly that the climactic scene was no different to Alien.<br/><br/>I've matured and mellowed somewhat over the past decade and a half and have grown to appreciate Aliens more and more. It is such a finely turned creation that mixes perfect amounts of action, horror, science fiction, feminism and (dare I say it), anti-capitalism.<br/><br/>I viewed the extended 148 Aliens on DVD yesterday and I love the extra scenes. The shorter length cinema version by comparison is excellent, but in my opinion just a little too frenetically paced. I love the extra information about Ripley and the god-awful future society she's forced to exist in.<br/><br/>It's very rare for a sequel to equal or better it's predecessor, yet Aliens easily equals the brilliant Alien. The central reason Aliens is so successful as a film is that it uses lashings of originality which carries on neatly from where the previous film ended. If only more directors and writers felt the need to create an original story when they're hired to create a sequel.<br/><br/>There are so many strong and plausible barriers for the characters to work against during their adventure. And the characters themselves are all well drawn and quirky which creates great scene dynamics. There are so many times when I felt like slapping Bill Paxton across the face and shouting: Â‘Deal with the situation man!' Fortunately I didn't have to do this because Ripley put the bugger into line.<br/><br/>Even though I've seen Aliens 15 times, I could watch it again tomorrow. 9/10"

"Lt_Coffey_182","10","1","2","8 July 2003"," Action packed and a great plot
","Aliens is my second favourite film so this is going to be a bit of a one sided review. It is by far the best in the Aliens series, with the best cast, direction and story line.<br/><br/>What I love so much about this film is the characters. Ripley is much better in this than in the first, she is much stronger, yet at the same time, more vulnerable (especially in the special edition). In Alien, she is too weak, Alien 3, she over does the tough image, except for the beginning (I am yet to see resurrection). Then there's Hicks, possibly my second favourite hero ever second only to Kyle Reese. It is not simply because I am a Michael Biehn fan, but the way Hicks' character is illustrated. He is the only down to earth marine, and is the only marine caring for Ripley. He has to take on great responsibility from being a 'grunt' to leading the mission for a short spell. Hudson and Vasquez are two really fun, macho characters played by two actors who I like (especially Bill Paxton). They help to give the film a lot more character.<br/><br/>Weaver is regarded as a good actress and this was the performance that really got the roles coming her way. Quite simply, she is brilliant in this film. The way Weaver handles Ripley's development as a character is very creditable and her scenes with 'Newt' (Carrie Henn) are very touching to watch. Michael Biehn plays a similar role to that of Kyle Reese in The Terminator. The main difference is that all the vulnerability and naivety Biehn showed in The Terminator is gone and has been replaced with great confidence. Bill Paxton as Hudson is a great piece of casting, especially beside Biehn as Hicks. The way the characters contrast is very effective and also allows for some more humorous moments which a film of this intensity needs.<br/><br/>James Cameron is my favourite director. Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies are all great films. He really gets the best out of his cast and uses resources to their full extent. His idea of only having five alien suits in this film and using them repeatedly works much better than any CGI favoured by today's film makers. When it comes to using special effects and models/suits, there is no one better. Aliens is a masterpiece of art expressed in film. Stan Winston, yet again, proves his worth in this film as Geiger's alien vision looks at its best in this film. It is a very sleek figure that is simple, yet complex in design.<br/><br/>With some truly stunning action sequences to bulk up the entertainment of the film, Aliens really does have the full package and it can even be said, in my opinion, that the film is flawless. Aliens, like The Terminator, is one of the few films to gain so much respect outside the Sci-Fi genre and it is through Cameron's writing skills and the amazing acting from everyone involved. Hard not to like, Aliens will always live long in cinema history."
"Zoopansick","10","1","2","1 July 2003"," One of the best 5 sci-fi/action movies ever!
","This movie shows what is possible with a good director for a sci-fi movie. Under Cameron's direction this film creates an entirely unique feel from the first one (which comes off as more of a horror suspense film) while remaining creepy.  Aliens is one of the best action movies ever made, and there are several reasons for that.  The first is that it takes time to build up to any action at all, and by the time it does you actually have some feelings for the characters.  I think when the first action scene does come as an audience member you actually feel the desperation of the marines as they get ambushed by the aliens.  The audience actually hates the Paul Reiser character too, and more geniuenly then they do the usual bad guy.  He is slime and people love it when he finally gets what he deserves.  In my opinion most sci-fi films fail because the audience (especially a modern cynical audience) doesn't suspend their beliefs and won't accept spaceships and monsters etc.  But Aliens is one of those rare few that people accept. The characters are developed and human and the aliens themselves look real and believable.  The action is well paced and once it gets going it really moves.  I think this movie is really a blast the first time you see it, because you don't know who is gonna make it out, or what's gonna happen next (though I'm sure many suspected Weaver to survive).  I think the first movie set the stage for that unexpected element, but this one delievers a totally different and in my opinion better experience than the first.  If you like sci-fi or even just action movies this one isn't to be missed.  It's highly influential in both genres and ranks in the top 5 in both, or at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>

"CSe7en","10","1","2","23 June 2003"," The best ever filmed ever made.
","The start of the early 80's, could the sensational Alien ever have a sequel it deserves. Well it didn't look good, who the hell was this kid, James Cameron.<br/><br/>Stop worrying what Cameron went onto to do was nothing less than remarkable, Aliens is a science fiction masterpiece for your average John Doe. The film actually eclipses Alien. If Alien was the monster movie set in the spooky house, Aliens is the movie that captures all the emotions of the not so long ago Vietnam War.<br/><br/>The film, is well over 2 hours but it doesn't feel like it, it was well paced out leading to the sprint at the end. It starts with Ripley suffering a nightmare and in the end will see Ripley, Hicks, Newt and Bishop all happily drift off to sleep.<br/><br/>The characters are all well built up except maybe some sterotypical grunts of the marines. We have Ripley who though she survived the events of Alien is pyschologically suffering. Carter Burke a scrupulous business man from Weyland and Yutani. Hicks is the strong silent type marine. Hudson the cocky marine turned into grovelling boy. We care for all these characters which is something that was o so missing from the next two installments of the franchise.<br/><br/>This is also James Cameron's best film, because the film does not rely on set action pieces it relies on the relationships the characters build up. Even the aliens are not shown as monsters but creatures who have built in maternal instincts and the will to survive.<br/><br/>I really really hope that James Cameron gets to write and produce Alien 5, and even better if Ridley Scott directs. But let's face it with the rich characterisation, emotional context etc, provided by the ever brilliant Cameron, I think that even Ed Wood could churn out an Alien movie which would restore the glory of the first two movies."

After seeing this cool stuff i was almost can't sleep for weeks, I had to leave a light on :D (I was around 15 when i have seen it for the first time) Those aliens were perfectly made, they looked like real things.<br/><br/>The characters of the colonial marines (Apone!), Ripley, Bishop and Burke was almost too good. The bold and agressive soldiers, Ripley with her personal experience behind her with those aliens, Bishop the scientificly thinking team member and Burke, the wrong guy who cares for nothing except money and profit. I liked all of them.<br/><br/>The another aspect for i like this movie is the scifi environment the makers have built up. The abandoned colony, the spacecarfts, the landing ship, the APC, the weapons and so on.<br/><br/>Finally the stormy and rainy weather on the planet just made this whole movie a lot better.<br/><br/>COOL!"
"sundayshouting","10","1","2","22 May 2003"," The perfect action movie
","Alien set a new standard in movie making, and to follow it up was always going to be a near-impossible task (see Alien3 and Alien Resurrection for proof). But rather than try to replicate Alien's creepy intensity and heavy Freudian subtext, James Cameron sensibly opted for an all-out action flick instead.<br/><br/>The result is not only Cameron's finest film, but also one of the greatest action films ever made. The original (as opposed to the director's cut) builds the suspense brilliantly and despite the increased number of creatures, they are not shown in too much detail until the final quarter of the film, which helps preserve their mystery and therefore the fear which they inspire. There are strong performances (notably from Weaver, Biehn and Paxton), and the special effects still look great today. The eminently quotable script is pretty much word perfect, with the exception of some of Newt's scenes with Ripley which at times are a little cheesy.<br/><br/>But this is a minor niggle in an otherwise awe-inspiring film. The wealth of comic books, computer games and toys which it spawned confirm both its cult status and its broader appeal.<br/><br/>Worth noting: the director's cut is strictly one for the fans - the extra scenes are interesting but would ruin the suspense for a first-time viewer."
"ghenrikson-1","10","1","2","6 May 2003"," One of the best action movies ever made
","I think Aliens is one of the top ten action movies of all time.  Its success isn't accidental.  Cameron knew exactly how to make a good action film, and when you analyze this movie you can see what's missing in many lesser films. The opening sequence, with some basic shots and just a few lines of dialog, manages to summarize the entire film.<br/><br/>""Bio-readouts are all in the green, looks like she's alive! There goes our salvage."" <br/><br/>The first sequence establishes so many things which the film fleshes out. We know:<br/><br/>--Ripley survived --Corporations and the pursuit of money are still motivating factors in this universe --On a broader level, this is a universe that does not care about Ripley. There is no safe haven for her.  The salvage crew would have preferred it if she had been dead.  The Company would also prefer it if she had not made waves. --This universe cares more about its physical things than human life.  This is fleshed out in Burke's resistance to the idea of nuking the colony, which has a substantial dollar value.<br/><br/>I also like this sequence because it links the film back to us.  It implies that the ships of the future will still abide by the ancient maritime laws of Earth, which do indeed prevent a claim of salvage or prize money if a living person is found on board.  This link is maintained with the future technology, which includes elements of our own world just as our world includes elements from past generations.<br/><br/>Cameron keeps the pace going from there.  It's a uniquely cold and harsh action movie.  We are not at all certain that the heroes will win or that good will triumph.  Death is ever-present.  And we see that human greed is the real cause of it all.  Added to this is the analogy to Vietnam, where our well-armed soldiers were apparently overcome by low-tech VC.  <br/><br/>
This is a whole lot more than your typical shoot-em-up action movie can offer.  Yet Aliens also manages to include some of the greatest action sequences ever filmed.  It compares favorably with any current fare.  It actually relies on some very old-fashioned special effects ranging from blue screen to people in Alien suits, yet thanks to expert camera work it does not look dated at all.  If anything it looks much better than a CG fest such as ""Starship Troopers."""
"amcdavey","10","1","2","27 April 2003"," Vietnam in Space
","This has been discussed before, I'm sure, but Aliens is Cameron's war movie, albeit set in outer space. Why the Vietnam War? It's perfect because you have a group of Marines that are confident that they'll eradicate any foreign enemy due to massive amounts of firepower. But when they get to their destination, all hell breaks loose and they don't even have a plan nor any idea how to fight the enemy. Maybe it's an extreme take, but to me, my favorite movie of all time is truly an example of the Vietnam War in outer space."
"Angry_Arguer","10","1","2","24 April 2003"," I can't bring myself to hate this movie
","I tried and I tried and I tried.  I found every fault I possibly could with the plot (who's left behind on the Sulaco?), the effects (nice obvious rear-projection work), the characters (well, now we know where the origin of ""Spunkmeyer"" came from), and even the name.  Even so, I couldn't bring myself to hate it simply because ALIENS remains one of the most engaging and intense films ever created.<br/><br/>There is not the suspense and horror of the first movie, but James Cameron knew that there was no way to top it.  So, instead of ruining our expectations of a fright-fest, he delivers one of his typical sci-fi action thrillers.  Honestly, this dude pretty much is responsible for such things as Battlefield Earth and Men in Black with the kinds of things he creates.<br/><br/>There is the much-applauded Special Edition, but, other than providing some detail on Ripley's family and the sentry gun scenes, there isn't anything new to offer.  In fact, the scenes on the colony (pre-infestation) ruin whatever tension there would have been.<br/><br/>Cameron's directing talent is never great (even in Titanic), though here he is able to tell a good story (convoluted as it is), carry our attention through incredible editing and visuals, and still have some interesting dialogue.<br/><br/>The cinematography and production design is far inferior to ALIEN. However, due to the swiftly changing mood of the movie, we are blessed not to have to see them too much.  Some scenes such as the dropship embarking towards the processing plant and the alien battles are interesting to watch.<br/><br/>James Horner is one of the most underappreciated composers of this day and age.  His music here, albeit cannibalized from his prior work, still sets an appropriate mood with more than an accational nod towards Jerry Goldsmith's original score. Kudos.  The remainder of the sound effects are original and ear-catching at best, dull and repetitive at worst.<br/><br/>All in all, a good ball-bustin' actioneer that should stick with you for a while.  4.5 out of 5.

","Aliens is a fantastic classic, certenly Cameron's best and problably the best action movie ever made.

When I first saw Aliens, a year ago, I was so amazed with the movie and I became a fan of the Alien trilogy. Aliens is certainly the best movie of the trilogy, Alien was very good also, suspensefull with a great creepy atmosphere, Alien 3 is not so well done because of the dead of Ripley, it's soo tragic, I just can't watch it.

","The second installment, Aliens, has the best of everything: action, horror, comedy, drama, and a hint of romance. I was blown away when I saw this movie, and the special edition with restored scenes is even better. I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie and it is definitely my favorite. This movie has an amazing cast, with each character being memorable. Perhaps the most memorable character is played but Bill Paxton, who has some of the best lines in the movie next to Sigourney Weaver. I also became a big fan of Michael Biehn after this movie (and of course remembering him in Terminator). It wasn't until Titanic came out and everyone was talking about James Cameron and his past movies that I realized I am a fan of his as well. The Terminator movies, True Lies, the Abyss, and now Titanic are some of my favorites. It therefore does not surprise me that the second of the Alien films is my favorite. The third was dreadful and the fourth had amazing potential but fell short (I will review these also.) If you want to be entertained on all levels, this is the movie for you! Don't rent it, buy it, because I guarantee you will want to see it again and again."
"Mulder-82","10","1","2","12 March 2003"," Lights, camera, ACTION!!!
","In this movie the above standing one line summary has more than this one meaning. (some spoilers thoroughout the rest of this comment!)<br/><br/>This movie is literally action-packed. Although, it has the slow start that ALIEN had, which is good thing for such movies.<br/><br/>The surviving cast of the previous movie is reunited in this one. Well, as good as it can, especially considering that Sigourney Weaver and Jones the cat were the only ones to survive the first encounter with the alien. ;)<br/><br/>But instead we get some new faces. Let me mention a few of them here (Many of which also starred in James Cameron's The Terminator):<br/><br/>Michael Biehn: Two years before Aliens, he played the good guy in another James Cameron film, The Terminator (1984). He played this roll well, although he in most of his films portrays a soldier of some kind. A great point in his charachter, Cpl. Dwight Hicks, is that even though he builds an attraction to Weaver's charachter, there is no sexual stuff involved.<br/><br/>Bill Paxton: After having a very small role in James Cameron's The Terminator (1984), Bill got a part in this James Cameron movie. (NOTE: Bill Paxton actually spent more time in frame with Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator than Michael Biehn did but that's besides the point.) Bill's charachter's name is Private Hudson and has the most significant charachter development if you can call it that. In the beginning, he's this ""Ultimate Bad Ass""-wannabe, and in the 2nd half of the movie, he's, well, a coward. But as in many others of his performances he did a great job.<br/><br/>Lance Henriksen: He also played in The Terminator (1984). In this one, he's Bishop, the droid. Ripley has her suspicions about him from the start, and in one scene even we, the audience, are tempted to think, that he's the bad guy.<br/><br/>Carrie Henn: This is the only movie Carrie Henn has ever been in. And what a magnificent job, she did. A shame, she didn't do more, but it's best to quit at the top, right?<br/><br/>Paul Reiser: I saw both Beverly Hills Cop I & II and the Mad about you-series before I saw Aliens. I was a bit surprised when I saw his name on the opening title sequence. And all things considered he did a great job, even though it's still hard for me to imagine him in such a serious movie.<br/><br/>It's surprising to see, how many people worked in both The Terminator (1984) and Aliens (1986), and Aliens and Titanic (1997). F.ex. G.A.Hurd produced T1 and Aliens, James Horner wrote the music for Aliens and Titanic, James Cameron directed them all and Bill Paxton was seen in all three.<br/><br/>In short, the story of the movie takes place 57 years after Alien. After been found adrift and then returned to Earth, Ripley finds out that the planet in the first movie, LV-426 has been colonized. Later, contact is lost with the planet. At first, Ripley doesn't want to go back, but in the end she goes anyway. There she teams up with remaining cast en route to LV-426 unknowingly what surprises lie ahead.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be excellent. I saw this movie the first time in 2000 or 2001 and I've liked it ever since. Great directing, acting and music. Two thumbs up!"

","Alien was / is one of my all time favourite films.  The totally shocking and scary alien  a stealthy stalking killing machine  disposing the crew of Nostromo  it scared the bejesus out of me (it still does!).<br/><br/>Aliens picks up 57 years (or so) after the first film.  Ripley can't get over her experience with the alien  she decides to join a team of marines, sent over to investigate the disappearance of colonists on LV-426.  Everyone is sceptical of Ripley and her story of the alien.<br/><br/>Surprise surprise  the aliens have taken over the colonists and its up to Ripley and the surviving marines to escape from LV-426 and get rid of the aliens once and for all!  Hoorah!<br/><br/>This film works on so many levels.  It is highly original  tweaking this film into a `Vietnam-style' war film is a brilliant masterstroke by James Cameron  but retaining the sense of dread and menace from the original film<br/><br/>The characterisation is terrific  Ripley shows her softer, motherly side (not shown in the first)  but remains strong and determined  a great feminist character.  It shows her rising to the occasion once again  to face her demons one more time (alas the sequels!)<br/><br/>The marines are excellent  with their tough / cool in battle attitude  from the dyke-ish Vasquesez (she is so cool) to the `fragile' Hudson (I love it how he is so distraught through the movie until he finally gets over it  and you know what happens to him)  ;-).<br/><br/>Even Bourke is great (in a way)  he develops the issues raised in the first movie about who is worse (aliens or humans?).<br/><br/>The special effects are awesome and it was great how the aliens have changed from the original film into more of a fighting machine than being a sleek, silent killer.<br/><br/>Even though this film is `gold'  I still think the original beats it (only just) with its spooky atmosphere  I know heaps of people would argue with this!<br/><br/>My score 10 out of 10 baby!  A word of advice  watch the original cut rather than the special editioneven though some of the extra scenes are kind of cool (the shooting gallery gun thingos)  I find that the film was better without you knowing what happened on LV-426."

"Indecent","10","1","2","20 January 2003"," Greatest action sci-fi movie ever
","In contrast to what the message before me says, i think the movie was great. I saw it in the 80's and i love it even today. This movie has depth, a good plot, good acting, and good direction from a person that rivals spielberg: James Cameron.<br/><br/>But yes there are a few things that i had a problem with. I thought that the marines in general were not too believable because they were really loose and talked back to there superiors. If the marines did that today they would probably in the hospital with a concussion. Also, the whole ending sequence with the alien queen. I mean, does she have the ability to change her size on a moments notice!?!? One minute she's like 30 feet tall and the next she's 12 ft. (and squeezing in that small human only fitting stairwell in the dropship). and last but not least the flamethrower. During the alien ambush scene towards the end of the movie, Gorman tries to rescue vasquez from a group of aliens with a pistol!!!! Is he suicidal or just plain stupid??? They left behind a perfectly funcitioning flame thrower at operations, albeit it was half empty. but if it was me up there give me the flamethrower, hell, give me a sharp stick!!!<br/><br/>Ok, with enough ranting aside, it was genuinely a good movie, with only minor flaws to the production. Alien 3 and Ressurection, those are movies with BIG flaws.<br/><br/>And vasquez was the best, i loved her macho-ness. You have to understand her character to like her. Before joining the corps., Drake and her were both in prison. So there's not really much she would be afraid of.<br/><br/>This will be my favorite movie for a long time. Wait, you never know-theres supposed to be an alien vs. predator. But nonetheless, this has set the bar in which all other sci-fi action movies are graded upon.<br/><br/>Its hard to beleive that James Cameron was a truck driver before being a director."
"ilikeimdb","10","1","2","23 January 2003"," Great movie regardless of your sci-fi orientation
","This is a great sequel though James Cameron chucks the creepy Ridley Scott atmosphere for a more action-oriented format. One of the opening sequences shows an unaccustomed brilliance -- the scene where the face shot of Ripley dissolves/merges into the picture of the planet is of such loveliness, it's jaw-dropping every time I see it. This is much more than a typical ""schlurp and munch"" movie. Great action, great dialog, great plot pick up from the original. Yes, the Marines are rather stereotypical, but at least they're a fun bunch and have some depth and differentiation. Ms. Weaver got the Oscar nod just for her delivery of that classic line ""Bitch!"" line. Too bad she was up against Marlee Matlan for Children of a Lesser G-d. <br/><br/>BTW, I don't like the directors cut. The original actually removed superfluous scenes and there's no way to cleanly skip over them in the directors ""restored"" cut. Sorry; the studio got it right the first time and the movie is better without the extra scenes with just one exception: The scene where you find out about Ripley's daughter (to establish a more reasonable justification for Ripley going back for Newt). Otherwise, the other junk should be jettisoned."

","This my favorite movie of all time, but I won't dwell on the brilliance of the plot.  Let's talk about those marines!<br/><br/>Vasquez: ""Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?"" ""No. Have you?"" Apone: ""You heard the man, and you know the drill!  A**holes and Elbows!"" Frosty: ""Hey man, what are we supposed to use, harsh language?""<br/><br/>The quiet, but cool Hicks. And, of course, Hudson: ""We're on an express elevator to hell, going down!"", ""Game over, man!  Game over!"" If you're going to make a sci-fi flick with a touch of horror, this is the blueprint; clearly, after about 30 minutes the bad guys have to start waxing people left and right, but this movie gets it right.  The Marines are really cool; the aliens are just way cooler.  You think the marines are sweet, which makes the Aliens even sweeter, which makes the whole ""long odds of Ripley surviving"" bit actually work. This is but one of the many reasons this film puts all of the sci-fi children to bed.  Pre-Titanic James, how we loved you..."

is that this movie should have ended about 15 minutes earlier than it did. In my opinion, this movie should have concluded with the destruction of the colony installation.

You can tell that it has been artificially set up from the very beginning of the movie, with those silly exoskeletons.  It's so ridiculous, it pains me.

","James Cameron cemented his reputation as a bravura filmmaker with this, only his third directorial effort (following PIRANHA II and THE TERMINATOR). He and producing partner Gail Anne Hurd took what's usually a crap assignment -- making a sequel to an established hit -- and extrapolated the original's main characters and themes brilliantly.  Despite a tight budget, given the requirements of the action and effects, they delivered what must have been quite a surprise to the studio:  a film that in many ways surpassed its predecessor in sheer entertainment value.<br/><br/>In 1986, as a loyal member of the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films, I attended a 20th Century Fox pre-release slide presentation for ALIENS, at which the publicist summed up his take on their upcoming film thusly:  ""You have no idea!""  And he was right.  All of us sci-fi fans who were there were just hoping for a decent sequel; something that wasn't too stupid and insulting to its transcendent source material.  Little did we know.<br/><br/>Not too many months later, I managed also to be at the Avco Cinema in Westwood for the opening night of ALIENS.  In the same audience with me were none other than Cameron, Hurd, and studio exec Scott Rudin, there presumably to observe the unspooling of their film with a real, not recruited, audience.<br/><br/>I often think back to that evening, probably the best movie debut I've ever experienced.  Because the crowd went nuts, me along with them.  From the opening shot, you could sense that these filmmakers ""got it""; that Cameron really, truly, totally, completely knew what he was doing.  And you should've heard the hollering and whistling when Ripley finally faces the Alien Queen, strapped into her Power Loader suit, snarling her trademark line with perfect fearless rage:  ""Get away from her, you BITCH!""  I'm telling you, it doesn't get any better than that.  And I bet Jim Cameron really felt like King of the World at that precise moment."

","-Spoilers- Aliens is the rarest type of film: A sequel that surpasses the original. Set 57 years after the original, Ripley's escape pod has been found, and she is returned to earth. Once she gets there, however, her story is discounted and The Company fire her for detonating her old ship. A few weeks later Burke, an employee of The Company, asks her to go with a group of marines to LV-426 (the planet where she found the first alien), where contact has been lost with a colony of terraformers... Aliens is a fantastic movie. It is quite different from 1 & 3 in the series, in that there is a huge nest of Aliens instead of one, and Ripley actually has some decent firepower. Yet it doesn't descend into the usual action cliches of firefight after firefight: the few marines left after the initial alien attack are stranded, and try to barricade themselves in, leading to some tense and genuinely frightening moments as the aliens grow ever closer. The characters are also well-developed, which is a change, you really feel something as they die, which adds to the overall effect. The acting is extremely high quality; some characters aren't hugely likeable, but they're still enjoyable to watch. It helps to have seen Alien- it explains all the references to the previous battle with the aliens, and Ripley's antipathy towards Bishop, a synthetic. This is undoubtedly the best film in the series: while it doesn't having the shocking ending of 3, the almost-happy ending rings true, which makes the start of 3 even more tragic (but that's another spoiler). Overall this film is interesting, exciting and genuinely scary: 10/10."

Movies today like the crap Jerry Bruckheimer spews out have made movie audiences forget what a real action film is. This isn't a cliched buddy cop pic or a yawn-inspiring spy movie....this is a testosterone-charged, relentless catapult into the best that sci-fi thrillers have to offer. James Cameron followed up the brilliant ""Terminator"" with this masterpiece, solidifying his claim as one of the stronger directors in Hollywood (yeah, I know he made Titanic, but we all make mistakes).

","In my opinion this is much better than the first movie and is probably the best horror film ever.  The first film despite being regarded as a classic had only one alien-a mistake which is more than rectified in this fantastic sequel."
"v2pointoh","10","1","2","7 July 2002"," Ellen Ripley, one of the first real action heroines
","Aliens is easily one of my Top 5 favorite movies.  The intense mix of claustrophobic action, drama, and science fiction pulls me in and never lets go until the movie ends.  It's a psychologically draining pulse-pounding film, but don't let that stop you from seeing it.  Just don't forget to breathe!  And, yes, it is much better than Ridley Scott's excellent original Alien.<br/><br/>Everyone else has mentioned most of the strong points of this film. However, the one thing that really struck me about it back in 1986 was that for one of the first times ever, we were watching a strong, intelligent action heroINE.  James Cameron wrote a wonderfully strong Ripley.  While we always suspected she could be tough in Alien, we find out just how tough in Aliens.  In fact, I'd argue that Cameron films almost always have very strong female lead characters.  Sarah Conner in Terminator 2 and Rose DeWitt Bukater in Titanic are other examples.  But what he did with Ripley was simply outstanding for the time.  While other action hero women in film have come along since, Cameron's Ripley is still the best.  She is no macho woman without depth, but is written as a very feminine heroine who is simply put in a position where she has to defend her surrogate ""daughter"" and herself against an unspeakable enemy.  <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, you don't know what you're missing. It's an entertaining action thriller that just happens to be a bit of a ground breaker, too.  10/10"
"Ithaqua1987","10","1","2","4 July 2002"," Aliens
","Aliens is one of the best movies ever made and features a superb blending of action, science fiction, violence, and characters. The best movie in the series and quite possibly the best sci-fi movie ever made Aliens is a true epic that stands the test of time in every possible way. The acting is extremely well done and features Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as Ripley. She is joined by a sleazy businessman played by Paul Reiser, and a team of high tech colonial marines played expertly by real life Vietnam vet. Al Matthews, and Cameron regulars Michael Beihn, Bill Paxton, and Jenette Goldstein. Lance Henriksen also stars as a soft spoken company android with good intentions for once. The film also boasts the best music of the series with James Horner at the helm of a rousing orchestral score. Exceptional in every way, the only thing that true fans of the original will miss is the horrifying creepiness and the genuine scares of the first, but if you ask me, the action and characters make up for that in a millisecond. Recommended for anyone who enjoys non stop action, sci-fi, or horror."
"trappjl","10","1","2","19 June 2002"," This is the best movie ever!
","The first time I saw this movie it scared the p*** out of me.  Even though is was scary Aliens is more an action than horror movie.  If you liked the first movie for its subtle horror, you'll love this one for its loud in your face action.  Aliens is the only scfi movie I know( other than Star Wars) that's a war in space and everyone's invited.  If you haven't seen it once than rent it but if you've already seen it rent it again.

","When I first heard there was a sequel to ""Alien"" been made I thought that classic line from Douglas Adams' ""Hitch-Hikers Guide to the Galaxy"": ""Oh no! Not again!""

He managed to give us another side - another view - of the aliens and to help us to understand how tenacious the species is.<br/><br/>As usual with Cameron films, the ""Special Edition"" gives even more depth to the original theatre release. I have both versions. I only ever watch the Special Edition. I have just one reservation about the Special Edition: there is one too many Hudson scenes - the one where he's blabbing on about all the weapons they're carrying on the drop ship; in the APC. It just goes on too long (Paxton improvising?) and for me weakens his character.<br/><br/>Never mind.<br/><br/>10 out of 10.<br/><br/>(A footnote to sequels: a certain J K Rowling has surpassed each and every Harry Potter novel with the next one.

This movie combines action, special effects  that look good even today and an unforgettable atmosphere that has set standards for almost every science fiction flick since.

","This film will always be my favourite by a long way. Everything about it oozes class and ultimate action from the start to the end. I have it on VHS plus i recently purchased the special edition on DVD. Anyway, Aliens; what can i say? Out of all the trilogy Aliens stands out as the most memorable film due to the contribution of one man ""BILL PAXTON"" he makes the film for me. Without him then the film would not be where it is now. I read an article about the film Aliens and its was about Jenette Goldstein (Private J. Vasquez)It said that she saw the advertisement for a film called Aliens and she turned up at the audition with a dress on and she had hair down to her ass and also she had high healed shoes on. She thought that it was a film about Illegal Aliens and if you notice that in the film after she says the line ""where they are"" Bill Paxton(Hudson) says ""yeah she thought it was illegal Aliens and signed up"" James Cameron found this to be really funny that he gave Jenette Goldstein the part, and what a performance she gave us. Michael Biehn(Hicks) adds in a great performance also which seamed to be a great time for the actor with such films as The Abyss, The Terminator but sadly he has fell down the line now. I feel that the other 2 Alien movies after this one were shocking and a disgrace to have anything to do with this one as they were to laughable and just plain sad. I could of wrote a better script for the last one. I hope that Ridley Scott and James Cameron both give us a blockbuster of a movie with Alien 5 if it ever comes to light. It would be good to see the two masters working side by side, we might see a proper Aliens film once again. God Bless Aliens xxxxx"
"HPeep","10","1","2","26 May 2002"," The Scariest Movie Ever
","SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Aliens is by far the scariest movie ever made. It also has a great story, great acting, but sadly out-dated special effects, and numerous technical errors. Don't get me wrong, the visual splendor presented throughout the movie makes up for a few mediocre effects shots. The story is simple but effective: The planet from Alien is colonized but contact is lost and marines are sent. Conflict begins and many marines die.<br/><br/>The most suprising thing (to me) about Aliens is that there are maybe 9 shots with gore in them. This is the least gory in the series (You want gore check out 3.)by far.<br/><br/>I have two versions of the movie: Widescreen Theatrical VHS Tape and Widescreen Special Edition DVD. Both versions are incredible but the Special Edition is better than the Theatrical version (only flaw with SE: those hamsters in the cage would have always come up on the motion trackers, what did they do to them to stop them from moving?). An uber-Special Edition should be made with more gore, enchanced sound/special effects, corrected flaws, and new credits. Theatrical: A-. Special Edition: A+<br/><br/>Rated R for extremely intense sequences, some strong violence/gore, excessive profanity, and suggestive humor."

","Let me just start by saying that this is the best movie ever made! It just is. I've seen lots of movies, and nothing is as gripping as this movie. The first time I saw it was on video in 1987; and somehow, I saw the director's cut. For almost 8 years after that I kept telling my friends about how cool Aliens was - especially the scene with the motion guns. Well, no one knew what I was talking about when I refrenced to the ""motion guns"" so one day I went to the video store to rent the movie and prove it to my friends. Well, to my surprise, the motion guns weren't in the movie! Well, to make a long story short, I spent a couple of years trying to track down the footage that I knew I had ""scene"". Finally, I ran into a guy who had Aliens on Laserdisc and I was able to dub a copy on to VHS. I was in heaven. You can imagine my excitement when the DVD Legacy pack was released just last week. Oh, by the way, a new PC game was just released ALIENS VS. PREDATOR. I highly recommend this. It's even more intense than the movie (well, maybe not more intense, but it's intense, baby!) Go get the game .... you won't regret it. Long live Aliens!!"

The successor to the equally brilliant ""Alien"", this movie is more action-oriented and in-your-face.  The cast is excellent, as is the cinematography, which allows the viewer a grainy, gritty vision of the terror which ensues.  This is one of the few movies which actually benefits greatly from the reabsorption of its deleted scenes -- the Director's Cut laserdisc and DVD are far superior to the theatrical and TV cuts.  James Cameron's work at its finest, ""Aliens"" is not to be missed by any movie buff, no matter what genre one might prefer."

","Aliens is a movie which has captivated me since I was a child seeing it in the theater.  It has the rare (and these days, ever the more rare) ability to envelop you to the point that you forget about yourself and actually enter the movie.  For those two hours plus (see the special edition if you haven't!) it is complete escapism into a survival drama rivaled by no other. The characters are all cast wonderfully, the script is first rate, the direction and editing are tight, and the scenery is engrossing.  My faorite film of the sci-fi/horror genre."
"johnnymonsarrat","10","1","2","13 April 2002"," Jon Monsarrat review: safe if you hate ""horror"", it's really ""action""
","""Aliens"" is not a horror film. I know, I know, the original ""Alien"" was a famous horror film. And there's plenty of scary stuff in Aliens, but there's surprisingly little blood (it all happens off-screen) and the look & feel of the movie is really sci-fi action.<br/><br/>Made by can't-fail director James Cameron (""Terminator 2""), Aliens has not aged a day (I've seen it recently) and is a total trip worth watching over and over. If you liked ""The Matrix"", aliens is just as good and no scarier.<br/><br/>I'm not arty at all -- I lack the refinement to appreciate the<br/><br/>costuming or the score if the movie is terrible. But I do appreciate an intelligent film that doesn't insult my brain. In ""Aliens"", there are real characters who do things that make sense. The plotting is tight, and there's plenty of action. Even the cast of a dozen marines (too many for truly deep characterization) have a surprising amount of individuality. And there's some fine acting.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really have ""something to say that changed my life"" (such as ""Contact"") but there are a ton of interesting, deep issues as well, which is something that characterizes other Cameron films, ""Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2"".<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Action movie buffs: a must-see. What, you haven't already rented this? Go get it now! Might be a touch too scary for your non-action loving spouse but try it anyway.<br/><br/>-- Sci-fi buffs: a must-see, but the film is not for young kids<br/><br/>-- I'm guessing here (not being an arty guy) but drama / arty types might also like it. The cinematography, acting, deep issues are all good.<br/><br/>I'll give ""Aliens"" a well-deserved 10 out of 10."

"kulani_jackson","10","1","2","24 January 2002"," Incredible Direction
","Action is perhaps the genre best suited for film, for where else can you create not only drama but all of the incredible cuts, both audio and visual, that create drama upon drama upon drama?  Ridley Scott is a master of this, and deserved more attention for this masterpiece, which was truly better than the original.  From a popcorn entertainment perspective to a post-feminist deconstructive academic perspective, this film satisfies on every level.  Without Sigourney Weaver, this film would have still been amazing, as opposed to Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection.  Admittedly, the original Alien is also quite good.  But the attention to nuance, to moments, to mini-moments, to asides, to brooding, to mystery, to terror, to human emotions, to anti-emotion, to corporate greed, to labor greed, to child abuse, to psychological trauma, to Giger's incredible artistry, to editing, to storytelling, to entertainment is just incredible.  I have watched this movie more times than any other and am always entertained and always in awe of Mr. Scott."
"DorianWynHowells","9","1","2","18 January 2002"," ""Get away from here you BITCH!!!""
","Well, what can you say that's not been said about this film?!<br/><br/>
This film, along with T2 is the best action blockbuster ever and critically acclaimed as one of the best sequels ever!<br/><br/>With a budget that could have fed a small country, James Cameron invites us to join Ripley as she returns to the desolate planet where her crew were, as an outcome, slaughtered one by one by an Alien. E.T. this is NOT!!<br/><br/>The film opens up pretty well, with Weaver showing her strength immediately, but the film only really begins when Ripley, the Marines, and Burk (dick!) hit the planet! Once we're there, we're in the thick of it.<br/><br/>This is probably the most atmospheric film I have ever seen, The Blair Witch Project comes a close 2nd! Cameron knows how to build suspense and keep us on the edge of our seats, until he's ready to let us relax, and there isn't much relaxation time on the Aliens' planet.<br/><br/>The use of the Mrines' camera's is what really builds tension - we can't really see anything, and we get scared, very scared.<br/><br/>Scripted by Cameron? surely not? Where's the cheese? There's not much here, it's one of his earliest film's so he had to play it cool and deliver the goods, and he does so, oh believe me he does. He has managed to write a very good storyline here which is both horrific and comic. Ah, those were the days eh Cameron?<br/><br/>The SFX are outstanding, looking a little bit dated now, but still amazing anyway. <br/><br/>The Aliens? well, they just scare me witless!! The combination of drool, slime, and ooze, and a little bit of acid, (their blood! not the drug!) makes me shiver!!!<br/><br/>After seeing the 'Aliens Special Edition' which has restored footage, I still prefer the original cut. We are given an insight into Ripley's life back on Earth before the first film - she had a daughter, and she died. This then evokes pure emotional response to her overprotection of little Newt. (and why she feels close to that 'creature' in Resurrection!)<br/><br/>Ripley is a warm and loving woman, but don't dare mess with her, she has a sharp tongue!! witty, intelligent, and god damn sexy, Ripley in this sequel furthered the interest for parts of Heroines in films. Usually the hero of the movie would have huge biceps and big guns, here we have a very slim woman, she doesn't really want to be where she is, with a few guns and explosives, yet she brings the house down! What a woman. Who needs the Spice Girls??!!!<br/><br/>The final climactic battle between the Queen and Ripley is probably the best one-on-one ever in the history of film! It is electrifying. Ripley only ever gets a chance at this due to the fact that she is kitted out in a suit of armour! This machine does it's job, aided by Ripley's precise movements and skill at controlling it, she manages to overcome the Queen.<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on - but I WON'T!!<br/><br/>Just watch this film. Both versions if you like. Watch the cinema cut first though, and then watch the Director's cut/special edition.<br/><br/>Great plot, acting, SFX, direction, cast, explosions.<br/><br/>GREAT FILM!!! <br/><br/>9/10"

I feel the start of Aliens is actually the final scene of Alien and Aliens begins when Ripley is asked to return to the planet with the marines, from then on this movie is full on.  James Cameron was warned not to do this film and I think it's sad that nobody saw his potential. Aliens is sci-fi/action at its best, including fantastic special effects, non-stop action, one of the most memorable character's on film (Bill Paxton/Hudson) and an incredible music score. The special edition of the film includes elements that should never have been cut in the first place and I think this also shows the lack of faith studio executives had in James Cameron.

"jonathandoe_se7en","8","1","2","16 September 2001"," Game over man!
","The best thing about the Alien franchise is that the producers used a different director for each film, it really allows the film it's own individual signature. First up Ridley Scott made the slick and beautiful ghost movie Alien (1979); later David Fincher would deliver the dark and downbeat Alien 3 (1992), followed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet's twisted mutant Alien Resurrection (1997). So where does that leave Aliens (1986), well much like the other films it perfectly represents the director's style and career.<br/><br/>Aliens is a dark, damp, atmospheric action movie, possibly one of the best action movies ever made. The characters are totally believable (even if Bill Paxton's Hudson is unbelievably annoying) and the mother daughter relationship between Ripley (Weaver) and Newt helps crank the tension of the final reel right up to 11. But the reason this IS one of the best sequels ever is because it gives us what a sequel should, the character we love in a new and interesting situation. Cameron's style also helps, along with cinematographer Adrian Biddle; they create a tense and gloomy blue-lit labyrinth full of danger. <br/><br/>Even if it does loose points for the annoyingness of Hudson, and the fact that I don't think the director's cut is all that good (it adds too much making the film seem strained) this is a top notch action thriller and a noble sequel to Ridley Scott's classic.<br/><br/>8/10"

"Howlin Wolf","10","1","2","8 March 2001"," ""Dirty Dozen"" in space, with added spots of sensitivity...
","A different feel to its predecessor, but no less effective.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>   Weaver is again impressive as Ripley, she convincingly portrays a woman who is scarred by her experiences but willing to relive them for the sake of humanity.  The little girl, Newt, represents the hope we have for the human race and I think that's why a lot of purists were outraged at her not returning for pt 3.  Probably my favourite scene in the movie is where Ripley tries to placate Hudson by telling him that Newt managed to survive against the aliens.  His whiny ""So why'nt you put her in charge? and her smart little salute is perfectly played.<br/><br/>   This relationship between Newt and Ripley is where the film gets the sensitivity I mentioned from.  Aside from that, it's pretty much action all the way, but there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  I believe Cameron is the greatest living action director (Yes, Tarantino and Woo included. but I said ACTION remember? I didn't say he was altogether a better director than Quentin) and he has fun with the possibilities the film raises.  The Marines are all likeable, even to the point where you might LIKE to dislike the Hudson character.  Biehn basically does the same role as the earlier ""Terminator"" (You tell me that Hicks and Kyle Reese aren't the same character!)  No time for character development here, we got showdowns to stage!  Macho one-liners are present for the testosterone fueled amongst you, and the females in the audience will probably be there because of their fondness for the original.  <br/><br/>   The most important thing is: hardly anyone will come away disappointed. This is a sequel that doesn't desecrate the original, but instead just wisely does everything on a bigger scale.  A classic that deserves to sit proudly alongside ""Alien""."

","Back in the days when Hollywood movie execs knew that a man in a rubber suit was far more realistic than any CGI graphic, we were given this hot little number. To follow up Ridley Scott's claustrophobic masterpiece was always going to be a tough task but there are very few out there who could seriously argue that Aliens is overshadowed by its big brother. Even if we consider the fact that we are dealing with a film in which the humans and aliens are on a more level playing-field ( well, those guns are awfully big ), Cameron is still able to make the film as tense as its predecessor, with the use of the marines' shoulder-mounted video cameras being a particularly inspired touch. In terms of both look and feel, Aliens revitalized the genre."

","As good as the original is, ""Aliens"" is still the best of the popular series.  James Cameron's in-your-face direction creates edge-of-your-seat chills and thrills that will leave you shaken well after the film's final act.  Sigourney Weaver (Oscar-nominated) does some of the best work of her career.  This is definitely her show as she adds a new dimension to the film.  A group of space marines are assembled to find out what has happened on planet LV-426 (the planet from the original) after Earth loses contact with its inhabitants.  Weaver knows what has happened and warns the group of soldiers.  However, it takes an all-out assault by the title characters to convince the remainder of the crew that they are against an unbeatable foe. The screenplay is just smart enough to work and the supporting characters are great as well.  Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, Michael Biehn, and Bill Paxton stand out the most among the rest of the cast.  Although the film is very different from the original, its style makes it an incredible experience which is unforgettable.  A great addition to the action, sci-fi, and horror genres.  4.5 out of 5 stars."

"Reaper Man","10","1","2","2 October 2000"," James Cameron would be my celebrity dad
","I've skirted around the subject of doing a comment for Aliens for two reasons.  1) Because this film is so darn popular, no one would ever read it, and 2) Nothing I can say will do this film justice.  It's as simple as this: Aliens IS and always will be the finest example of an action film, a sci-fi film or a horror film anyone on this earth (or the next) will EVER see.  At 14 years old (and counting) this cinematic masterpiece is every bit as impressive, scary and mind-blowing as it was when it premiered.  The rich personality of every character is just as important to Cameron as making someone get cut in half look realistic, and THAT's what makes this film so good.  The Colonial Marines come across as gung-ho idiots alright, but we see them get scared, see paranoia creep over them, see real humanity in a survival situation.  And then we see an 8 minute long action-sequence with acid, grenades and copious swearing.  Could any other film claim to blend such rich character development with such rich character dismemberment?  NO. And that's why Aliens is a one-off, a film that cannot be topped and needn't be topped.  From every infinitely quotable line, to every moment that makes you jump, this film does nothing but make the hairs on the back of your neck tingle with excitement.  I watch this film lots, and I never tire of any part of it.  There, I've done it.  I've poured my heart out on to the screen.  God Bless Aliens, and all who watch her."

The acting is okay. Sigourney Weaver does a wonderful job at reprising her role as Ellen Ripley. It's no wonder she received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in this film.

The thought of an army of Aliens chocked the most of us back in 86 after experiencing ''Alien''. At first the feeling is a bit like the original movie. But soon you will find out that that is not the case. This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The special effects are really cool and Cameron really makes it go fast. The tempo is fast just as ''Terminator'' and ''T2''.

","Two things I don't like... Sigourney Weaver and Carrie Henn, but the rest of the movie more than makes up for it.  This movie is what started me on my Paxton obsession, He gives a stunning performance, playing the most profoundly human character in a slew of otherwise unremarkable marines. Michael Beihn gives a moderately good performance, enough to impress, but not astound me.  Lance Henrisken does a startlingly good job of acting without emotion, until you watch anything else he's in and realize that's just how he acts.  I forget at the moment who played Vasquez, but that was a good performance.  And Paul Reiser as a villain??!  HA!  that was GREAT!  I loved it!!  He plays another disturbingly human character(but he pushes the envelope with trying to impregnate Ripley and Newt).  Oh man, though, the screenplay... wow.  The dialog is right on, the story picks up seemlessly from alien, and for once in a sequel doesn't BASH US OVER THE HEAD with the fact that it's a sequel(ala Scream 2? maybe?) And though the idea of marines that deploy from orbital starships was ""borrowed"" from the novel ""starship troopers"", watching ten minutes of this movie and ten minutes of the adapted screenplay for that shows by FAR which is the better movie. Weaver is annoyingly predictable as the ""mothering"" character, and Henn even more so as the squealing little harpy that Ripley adopts.  I would have gladly traded them both for the ressurection of say, maybe Hudson and Vasquez? Can we do that?  But, I suppose it wouldn't be a legacy if the main character didn't survive, would it.  However, there is one thing that Ripley DID teach me.  If I'm ever going into an alien nest, armed only with a machine gun and a flame thrower, I'll bring TWO clips for the gun."

Aliens was alright as a good escapist movie for one viewing but James Cameron's filmmaking style is nothing to get excited about considering that he must payed the Oscar judges large amounts of cash to give his Titanic movie the thumbs up.

"JeffG.","10","1","2","8 October 1999"," Great movie. Especially the Director's Cut.
","""Alies"" is proof that not all sequels have to be bad. I actually kind of prefer it to the original. This movie takes what was introduced in the first movie and expands on it. <br/><br/>One of the admirable things about this movie is that they didn't do a retread of the original. While ""Alien"" was pretty much a horror movie set on a spaceship, ""Aliens"" is more of an action oriented sci-fi movie. The human elements of this movie really add to the film. Ripley decides to confront her fears (brought upon her by the events in the first movie) by going on the mission to the colony and benefits from it by the end of the movie. In the Director's Cut, we learn of Ripley's daughter who died during Ripley's 50-year sleep in the escape pod. This helps in explaining her realtionship with Newt.<br/><br/>The direction is excellent and the special effects are superb. The Director's Cut version of this movie adds 17 minutes of footage, where we learn about Ripley's daughter, see Ripley get stripped of her license by the Company, and see further development in the relationship between Ripley and Newt. This extra footage is not simply filler. This is footage that was important to the film and footage that James Cameron had to cut for time. The extra footage really does enhance the movie.<br/><br/>[WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW]......... Like the first movie, ""Aliens"" ends in a surprisingly peaceful manner following the chaos in the rest of the film. Only this ending is considerably less bittersweet than the end of ""Alien."" Ripley has faced her fears and overcome the nightmares she's been suffering from them. She's also been blessed with a new family in Hicks and Newt. I was really upset that they were both killed at the beginning of the horrible ""Alien 3."" But I try console myself by telling myself that ""Alien 3"" doesn't exist. Hey, if ""Highlander"" fans can deny the existence of the two dreadful sequels, why can't I do the same with the last two ""Alien"" movies?<br/><br/>This is one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the 80's and a true testimony of James Cameron's talents. I feel that this movie and the original ""Terminator"" are Cameron's best work."

","Twelve years ago, James Cameron made the ultimate sci-fi movie ever created. At first, it was thought that either it would be a bomb and ruin his career or be a box office hit and all the credit would go to Ridley Scott (Alien). Both speculations were wrong.  In 1986, Cameron made the most amazing Sci-Fi movie imaginable.  Adding all the aspects of a thick plot, action, suspence, terror, and realism any movie could possibly handle.  The acting was perfect as was the special effect.  At a budget of $18 million, Aliens beats even today's visual masterpieces.  After years of watching Aliens, I was able to watch the special edition and saw the sentry gun scenes as well as the colony scenes, making the movie a whole 2 hours 34 minutes long.

It is true that there are two Aliens-factions out there, one following the original Alien, Alien 3 and Resurrection, whereas the other group is a die-hard Aliens-follower and DESPISES the other movies in this series. I myself am part of the latter, but that is only AFTER I saw the series for myself and hence deduced that Aliens is such a powerful movie, it does not even need a prequel or further sequels!<br/><br/>Agreeing with another reviewer, I found this movie very much lively and very much ""alive"" as it had so much I could personally relate to! The characters are extremely well-developed and well-cast..no, PERFECTLY cast!! Biehn and Paxton give their very best performances, Weaver is just excellent, Rieser is truly evil, and Henriksen is the only person who looks like an android anyhow! The rest of the gang is just too mean and just too bad!<br/><br/>I have to admit, I own not one but TWO Aliens VHS-tapes, just in case something happens to one copy, and am planning to order the Special Edition soon!

But as much as I love the Mission: Impossible directors and although the movies as a whole are superior to the Alien movies, the directing talent of the latter series is ridiculous. In order, you have Ridley Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, all of whom have at least one movie on this list. How Alien: Resurrection turned out to be such a mess is still a mystery to me; yes, a lot can happen and people can be put on and kicked off and productions can be basically a toxic waste zone. But you still have not only the director of Amelie but bloody Joss Whedon on your movie. How do you screw that up? Okay: enough ranting. Time to get onto the review of one of the finest action movies ever made. The core of the film, of course, is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, still the finest female character as far as action is concerned. In the first film, she is not the focal character, as the audience was meant to be surprised when she was the only one that survived. It is a good narrative trick that worked perfectly, but I much prefer to see her front and center.<br/><br/>This movie knows how to walk the balance between pure action and emotional scenes. This lends the movie weight and combined with a sensible plot that is natural sequel escalation at its best as well as some of the finest writing I've seen in the action-sci-fi genre...makes the movie not just a boorish actionfest but a highly calculated yet unrestrained cold-blooded action monster. Your blood pumps and so does your mind; you feel a chill down your spine. The gravitas this movie has makes the action better and more piercing... not less. Take notes, Michael Bay.<br/><br/>There are no badly-written or badly-acted characters in this movie. That is a key version why people love this film so much and why people hate Alien 3, which killed off all the supporting cast. My personal favorite is Newt, a prime example of how to do a kid character right. She has the real kind of childish energy. It's not shallow and all 'gee, golly, mister.' It's raw and deep; optimistic but not euphoric. Say what you want about Cameron's writing ability (though I don't think anyone argues that this script is snappy and spectacular), but he has a talent of getting into the minds of character, particularly emotional. Everything they should be feeling at any given moment, they are feeling.<br/><br/>I love Newt because you feel the vulnerability and despair she's going through, but it does not turn her into a straight 'rescue' character. She does need to be rescued, but you don't mind because by that time, she and Ripley have formed such a bond that you feel like it is justified. You are with Ripley the whole time instead of seeing it as a film going through points, which I appreciate. The two do share a lot of nice little scenes that make the movie more than it would have been otherwise. It is kinda a shame that the child who played Newt decided not to become an actress. It's her choice, yes, but she did a mighty good job here. She expresses a whole range of emotions and comes out being as great of a kid character as Ripley is an adult character.<br/><br/>The themes expressed in this movie are interesting. Critics often accuse Cameron of not having nuance. I personally would argue that, for the most part, it is the critics who don't have the nuance. Even blatant environmental films like Avatar are deeper than they would appear to be, if only slightly.<br/><br/>Films like this are brimming with thoughtful thematic substance. (As a side note, I can't be the only one who laughs when I see 'some thematic elements' as an MPAA rating. I'm like, 'Yes, I would hope a movie I or my (nonexistent) kid watches would have theme. I would like very much if it were not an endless stream of nonsense.') Anyways, think about what happens in the film. An advanced military force is brought into to an unknown planet and is wiped out (except for Ripley, of course). No spoilers there. Why are they wiped out? They have advanced tech? Because they don't know the terrain. they don't know what they're up against. They lack wisdom. Now... if that doesn't sound like a lot of wars, particularly those fought by my country, then you need to get your hearing checked. Cameron himself has explicitly said that he based this film on Vietnam.<br/><br/>If you want to delve into that, go right ahead. If you want to just sit back and breathe in one of the most viscerally-stimulating movies of the decade, go right ahead. You have a choice. As all good action movies give you. And this is more than a good action movie. This is one of the greatest films of the decade. It even got Weaver an acting nom at the Oscars. In action movies, that. Doesn't. Happen. Yes, it was the eighties, but still. From beginning to end, this is a resonant and thrilling film. You will feel different after watching it. You should feel different after watching it. It is an emerald in a sea of rocks. If it were up to me, this would perhaps be THE definitive movie of the decade."

","The joy in watching this sequel from director James Cameron is that not only is there more aliens, but there are also more humans. This airbrushes the staple gloomy, isolated feeling of the original and gives more leadway for lively fun dialogue (see Bill Paxton) and a kind of united human togetherness.<br/><br/>Until, that is, the aliens wipe them out.<br/><br/>But Cameron also gives us an improvement in the series. Sigourney Weaver's Ripley wasn't more than a survivor in the first film, just like Jamie Lee Curtis was in the first HALLOWEEN. Here, though, her character has more depth and growth. She is shattered by the horiffic tragedy taken place in the first film. She still has nightmares of the slimy, carnivorous alien. She is disoriented because she has been in a hyper-sleep for 57 years. Later on in the movie though, she ultimately recovers and becomes one bad mutha to be be reckoned with! The very first strong female character in film history who isn't contradicted with sex appeal. A true-blue butch heroine.<br/><br/>Unfortunately she is in rather comic-bookish company with a rag-tag troop of high-tech marines joing her to fight the beasts that are still in existence on a planet that has been inhabited by human colonists. The marines are all one-dimensional except for Paxton's character who goes from annoying comic relief to panicky weenie throughout the film. There is also Paul Reiser as a backstabbing employee of the evil company which wants to exploit the alien beings and Lance Henriksen, the naturally mechanical actor as Bishop, the well-meaning android, ooh I mean, ""artificial person"". But the rest of the cast is merely decoration for the intergalactic feast the hordes of aliens have later on in the movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences vary from stimulating to boring, especially in these sad Michael Bay overkill times, but Cameron handles this masterpiece with skill and intelligence as well as explosions and gore.<br/><br/>
"" Let go of her, you... !!""  Ummm...heehee... maybe I shouldn't write that."

","As I said about the first, though, a male cannot give birth.

And just like in the first, she ultimately gets rid of her by forcing her out of the ship and into space."

","Next to ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""The Godfather Part II"" the best sequel ever made!<br/><br/>Take the tension from ""Alien"" and add to that some serious kick ass marines, the result is ""Aliens"". And my God, what a fine movie this! In some ways it's even more scary then ""Alien"", the tension is build up perfectly! The action is simply awesome. Letting marines fight the aliens was one of the best ideas in movie history.<br/><br/>The characters are terrific. The marines are very cool characters and are portrayed brilliantly by the actors of course especially by Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton as the hyperactive but entertaining Pvt. Hudson. Sigourney Weaver is a great leading lady, Ripley is truly one of the strongest female characters of all time. I also liked Paul Reiser a lot in this one and let's not forget to mention Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop.<br/><br/>James Horner delivers his masterpiece with the soundtrack. It's too bad it was cut in criminally. The music suits the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The movie is a lot of things at the same time: Scary, action packed, tense, funny and entertaining. The combination of everything is perfect.<br/><br/>It's too bad that some of the visual effects are heavily outdated these days but it doesn't ruin the movie by far. The aliens on the other hand look better then ever, especially the queen is a great piece of work. And so are the costumes and weapons.<br/><br/>There isn't much more I can say about this movie. All I can say is; see this movie now! Or if you have seen it before; watch it again! Is there anything I don't like about this movie?

I just couldnt do it. 2 and a half hours of pure garbage. Aliens barley show up and is nearly and if not just as terrible as the first. Theres nothing to say other than that.

","Director James Cameron (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, True Lies, Titanic) brought the superlative sequel to Sir Ridley Scott's science-fiction action horror thriller seven years later, and in terms of spectacle, this is much more elaborate. Basically, Ellen Ripley (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Sigourney Weaver) is finally picked up by her company, 57 years later, which shocks her, she also has many nightmares of her past experience. Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) asks Ripley to be an adviser (""that's all"") for a team of heavily armed soldiers that are going to the unknown planet (LV-426), where Ripley and the Nostromo team landed, which has over the years has been colonised, installed with a fusion powered facility to make the air breathable. Their mission seems to be to destroy the aliens (or Xenomorph) after contact with the planet is lost, but Ripley is eventually dragged into the action as more and more of the soldiers are being killed. Along the way, they find a survivor, Rebecca 'Newt' Jorden (Carrie Henn), and not long after they are stranded on the planet, with no communication to the company, and no shuttle to escape. They do make sure that the doors are secure so the aliens, and parasites (facehuggers) cannot get in, while android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) tries to get a shuttle to pick them up. They do eventually get close to escaping, but Ripley, looking for captured Newt does get to meet the mother alien, destroy her egg nest and sack, before escaping and the place that is destroyed. There is one final encounter with the alien queen not long after landing to safety, she in the Exosuit ""power-loader"" utters the great line ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" Eventually Ripley gets rid of the alien mother, throwing her into the blast doors and forcing her into outer space (just like the first one). In the end, injured Cpl. Dwayne Hicks (The Terminator's Michael Biehn), ripped-up Bishop, Newt and Ripley are the last survivors, all put into pods for hibernation. Also starring Bill Paxton as Private Hudson, William Hope as Lieutenant Gorman, Jenette Goldstein as Private Vasquez, Al Matthews as Sergeant Apone, Mark Rolston as Private Drake and Wishmaster's Ricco Ross as Private Frost. The special effects are much more impressive, and the action more intense and gripping, a brilliant sequel. I have also seen the extended version, that director Cameron prefers, the extra material does provide some good background to some characters, including where Newt came from, it is just as interesting and essential as the original. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Music for James Horner and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up Artist, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Sigourney Weaver was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Ellen Ripley was number 8 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Outstanding!"

","I feel like every time I review a sequel (or second movie in a franchise, or part 2 or a trilogy) that I am making excuses for how hard it is to follow up a big hit movie, and how writers and directors have a tendency to get too ambitious with follow-up films. But, **** that. There is no excuse for these big budget sequels with 'writing teams' and cutting edge effects that fall so far short of expectations.<br/><br/>If you waited years for this, stood in line for an hour, smoked great weed and saw the first showing in the theater, then you left happy. However, in 2019, I can watch Alien (1979) and watch this film the next week. Not 7 years of waiting, 7 days. So, I have clear memories of how great Alien (1979) is, and the contrast is striking.<br/><br/>James Cameron had a vision. There needed to be a despicable bureaucrat (Paul Riser) and a complete moron (Bill Paxton) and Ripley really needed to have Empty Womb Syndrome, and there needed to be SOOOO MUCH TALKING!!! The constant dialog, often terrible, totally changes the tone from the first movie. Ridley Scott built tension through sounds, accompanied by great direction and non-verbal acting by Sigourney Weaver. I kept yelling, ""JUST SHUT UP!"" at the television during this film. The childcare aspect changes the pace of the film, as well.<br/><br/>The final showdown with Big Mamma Alien is a great fight sequence, but it should have started 40 minutes earlier. This film had bad pacing, too many ideas, was too long, and is a huge letdown from Alien (1979).<br/><br/>RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

It is one of the cheesiest scifi movies I have EVER seen and I refuse to add it with my blu ray collection. The whole time I watched this I was hoping the cat would get eaten by an alien but nope! The acting was so cheesy I thought I was watching a low budget scifi film the whole time. This installment is pure trash and is def on my top 10 horrible films of all time! Save your brain and eyes from absorbing this terrible peice of cinema. I am so glad I didn't catch this in theaters as I would demand a refund.

","After destroying the Nostromo Ripley( Sigourney Weaver)) is discovered by a deep Space Salvage crew. She is taken to a space processing station. While there she is met by Weyland-Yutani employee ,Carter Burke( Paul Riser). While recovering from a deep hyper sleep she finds out 57 years have past. After recovering fully she receives some news about her daughter. She is distraught to hear she has passed with no surviving children. The two then head to her briefing with company executives. There she explains what happened to her crew and why she was forced to destroy the Nostromo. The Weyland Corporation is convinced she acted recklessly and sees her unfit as a flight officer. They pull her flight license, then is shocked to learn that 157 colonists have occupied LV426 for 20 years.<br/><br/>A day later Burke comes asking for Ripley's help. He is accompanied by Lt. Gorman( William Hope) part of a group of Colonial Space Marines. These Marines are trained for anything. Burke tells Ripley they have lost contact with LV426. At first Ripley refuses, but if she goes her flight license would be restored. Burke makes a promise that if it is an alien it would be destroyed; and not returned for further study.<br/><br/>The two are on their way along with these Colonial Space Marines to LV 426. When they wake from a deep hyper sleep they loosen up and have a quick meal. When Ripley finds out that Burke forgot mention Bishop is an android; she freaks . She makes Bishop aware she loath androids due to past experience. Afterwards Ripley briefs them on what they can expect. These marines have no idea what they are facing until Ripley explains that one was able to get aboard the Nostromo; and wipe out her crew in less than 24 hours. This especially gets Vasquez's attention( Janette Goldstein), after her smart remark towards Ripley. Thus, it will take more than fire power to rid a Xenomorph. Among these colonial Marines are Hudson( the Late Bill Paxton), Hicks( Michael Biehn), Bishop( Lance Henriksen).<br/><br/>Once the crew lands on LV426 it looks like a demilitarized zone. The crew checks out the inside of the complex and notice the remains of small arms fire, and destruction from Alien activity( damage from molecular acid). This brings back memories for Ripley. Everywhere they go it is desolate, except for the presence of mice in a lab(Special Addition). The group continues their search, and suddenly their trackers pick up movement coming towards them. They find out it is a little girl named Newt ( Carrie Hien) approximately 8 yrs old. She is the only survivor out of the 157 colonist , her parents and brother are gone. So they take her back to the lab, do a check up on her. Once they walk into the science lab they find three preserved face huggers, two of them are dead and one is still alive. Ripley goes back to check on Newt, which she somewhat adopts. When she returns to the lab, Bishop is examining one of the specimens. Ripley makes it a fact she wants them destroyed; but Bishop explains Burke wants them studied and taken back. This makes Ripley suspicious and she keeps her guard up.<br/><br/>The next step is locating the colonists PDT( Personal Data Transmitters) while they are in the operations lab. They locate what think is all of the colonist over at the processing station. When they are in the area they proceed in and notice, secreted resin, and past alien activity.As they proceed, they are ambushed not bu one alien; but many. They lose half of there platoon, and Lt. Gorman gets hurt. Ripley does what she can, and rescues those remaining from the processing station. After the loss of over half their crew, they decide to nuke the site from orbit. It fails due to an alien aboard the ship, as soon as it takes off it crashes. So the group has to return to operations and devise a new plan.<br/><br/>Once in operations they need to devise a plan to destroy these aliens, but they are running short on ammo. In the meantime, Hicks gets close to Ripley showing her how to use a pulse rifle with grenade launcher. He also gives her a wrist tracker. He is very caring toward Ripley and tells her to get some sleep. So she and Newt get a nap, but when Ripley wakes she notices she is locked in the lab, and 2 face huggers are loose. Burke has double crossed Ripley trying to get an alien back to the company. To do this one would impregnate Ripley or Newt, and he would sabotage Hicks space capsule so no one would know.<br/><br/>Suddenly the remote sentries pick up movement outside the complex, they only last so long. They need to get to the emergency vent which goes off every 4 hrs.. He is the only one that can remote pilot the Suloco, and he volunteers to go out. The remaining Marines Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez, Ripley and Gorman. Have to keep them from breaking their barrier. So each of them take turns making sure nothing breaches their perimeter. As they keep watch, they realize they have found a way in, through the roof and floors. Thus, leaving Ripley, Hicks, Gorman, Vasquez the only ones left.<br/><br/>While they are escaping Newt gets separated from Ripley, and falls into a shaft. She is able to locate her signal, but Ripley accidentally walks into the queens nest. Carefully she watches every move she makes, so she can escape. Then she uses the grenade launcher, plus fire to destroy the eggs and her egg sack. She reaches the landing platform and tells Bishop she is returning 4 Newt, so don't leave. When she goes back in she has so many minutes to locate Newt and get back. She finds her, but she has been cocooned. She still rescues her, and carefully works her way back. To her surprise Bishop isn't there, but suddenly shows. In the end, Ripley, Bishop, and Newt return only to find the Queen Alien is aboard the ship. Bishop is all but destroyed helping Ripley fight it, but in the end it is blown out into outer space.<br/><br/>This movie came out in 1986 and I still have fond memories seeing it as a 15 yr old in Dayton, Ohio .Aliens is just as good as the original, but Alien is still the best. The acting is excellent especially from Sigourney Weaver, and Janette Goldstein as Vasquez. I loved her style and I saw myself in her character, so BAD A$$. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE SPECIAL EDITION, IT HAS OF 17 MINUTES OF RESTORED FOOTAGE; A MAJOR PLUS TO THE MOVIE."

This is because James Cameron had the actors get to know each other a week before filming (more movies should do that).

","Back in 1986 20th Century Fox released the first sequel to its 1979 sci-fi/horror-great Alien directed by Ridley Scott. This time James Cameron scripted and directed after his wonderful success in 1984 with The Terminator. Here Cameron has made a sequel that first does no harm to the original or the 'Alien' name in following that film and essentially leading us directly to this sequel. Secondly, in my opinion it brings the bar that Scott has left so high and brings it up another notch. To me this is something that does not happen very often. Interestingly, Cameron did it again when he made Terminator 2 (which to me was even better than the original). Co-written with Walter Hill (who directed the 48 Hrs. movies) and David Giler.<br/><br/>Ripley (wonderfully played by Sigourney Weaver) is in deep sleep with Jonesy the cat after escaping the clutches of the alien from the original. She is found by a salvage team and woken up. Thing is she has been out for 57 years. The moon that she visited decades ago is now being colonized, but contact with them has dropped. In dealing with her own mental problems from her experiences in the first film she decides to join a group of marines to visit the moon and see what has happened.<br/><br/>Like I did with the first film I watched this with my girlfriend who has never seen this film. In the end I think she loves this film as much as I do. I could tell there were a few scenes where terror took hold, but this is more aimed into the sci-fi/action/adventure genre where as the original was more sci-fi/horror.<br/><br/>Also starring Michael Biehn as Corporal Hicks, Paul Reiser as Burke, Bill Paxton as Private Hudson and a really great performance from Lance Henriksen as Bishop. Weaver also got herself an Oscar nomination for her performance and I think she deserved it. In my opinion this film has the pinnacle of the Ellen Ripley character in her interactions with Newt (played by Carrie Henn), her desire to never give up and her ability to kick ass.<br/><br/>Now, I own the Director's Cut version and would personally suggest viewing it. It does add 17 minutes of material and off the top of my head I can not think of a scene that really shouldn't have been added. Some times when extending the film from its original theatrical length can hinder the film a bit, but here in my mind it helps this film. It really gives you more character story or to me adds more meat on the bone. With the Director's Cut it clocks in at over two and a half hours, which to me is sometimes a breaking point on how long your film should be. But, to me it never begins to push you to a point of wondering when the film will end. Highly recommended."
"audrablum","10","1","3","20 October 2018"," Great story, great director, great experience
","This week I watched Aliens (1986) directed by James Cameron. The movie contained many of Cameron's directorial fingerprints and I saw some choices that carried over into his later film Titanic (1997). I thought the film was very well done. The script was really well written with a definitive story arc, good pacing, and every part of the script further drove the movie forward. I admire Cameron's sense of humanity that he injects into the film. Ripley was a strong female lead who was graceful, but knew how to take care of herself. In this regard, Cameron is one of the more in touch directors who includes positive and likeable female roles in his stories. The story was duly action driven and character motivated, which is really what kept the movie so interesting. I think that many action directors forget that half of the value of the film is the character. Action and special effects are only part of the equation and I think that Cameron proves this in Aliens. There were intense moments, but half of the fear was driven by whether or not the characters were actually going to live through the next moment, because we cared about the characters. This setup made for a great journey and a healthy payoff in the end. This was probably one of the most intense action-adventure-sci-fi films I have ever experienced and I love that it was an older movie. We should learn from those that have gone before us and not dismiss older films. There is value in what the greats knew and how they created these masterpieces and modern filmmakers should take note."

","""Aliens"" (1986) is a Sci-Fi action adventure about Ellen Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, as she goes another round with sinister extraterrestrials. After being saved from a 57-year hyper sleep by a space salvage team, Ripley is enlisted to help a team of highly trained colonial marines search a space colony that has gone dark. This film was extremely creative for its time. I remember effectively being freaked out when I first watched this film as a child because it was a very wide departure from films like ""E.T."" Watching it again now, I am awestruck at some of things they were able to accomplish with a realistic feel.<br/><br/>The production value of this film appears surprisingly beyond its years. When I initially heard the sound design within this film it felt very real, but revisiting it now, some sound effects would serve better if they were updated to match the current technology. However, the film is still successful with the audio it currently uses. The story is strong and the visuals are creepily immaculate. Overall, I really enjoy this film and foresee myself revisiting the entire series. I would highly recommend this film to anyone that likes action adventures with a strong female heroine and doesn't conform to the norm."

"jaredpahl","8","1","3","14 July 2018"," Bigger, Meaner, More Action-Packed. Aliens Is a Crude, but Bitchin' Sequel
","When Aliens hit theaters in 1986, it's predecessor, Ridley Scott's Alien, was already a science-fiction classic, and it's director, James Cameron, was a relative unknown in Hollywood. Coming on the heels of his surprise hit, The Terminator, Cameron blew the doors off what anyone was expecting to see in a sequel to Alien. Aliens was a huge, ambitious sci-fi action spectacular that traded quiet horror for slam bang pyrotechnics. It was a rousing success in 1986, but looking back at it today reveals some cracks. As per usual for a James Cameron film, Aliens is a rock solid story with some totally badass moments, but unlike Cameron's later work, it never quite captures the exquisite craftsmanship and event movie feel of The Abyss through Avatar.<br/><br/>57 years after the destruction of the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley is discovered by a deep salvage team and recruited to join a team of Colonial Marines on a mission to a colonized moon that has been overrun by a horde of xenomorphs. It's a genius story premise by Cameron, taking the seeds planted in Alien, and growing them, naturally, into something bigger and better. This is what sequels always strive for, and rarely achieve. Aliens is a completely different kind of film from Alien, but it extends organically from it. It's also better than Alien. More exciting, more fun, and with a more potent emotional core.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver is far and away the standout of the cast, which is otherwise comprised of the old Cameron standbys, hard-core chicks (Janette Goldstein as Vasquez), military grunts (Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton), and greedy corporate men (Paul Reiser). Weaver is fantastic as a woman traumatized by the events of Alien, who finds purpose in the protection of a stranded young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn). Her Ripley is one hell of a character. Fearful yet warm, determined but motherly, and in the end, a complete badass. Her Oscar nomination was unquestionably deserved.<br/><br/>For a film famous for its action, with the greatest action director of all time at the helm and a story perfectly designed for rip-roaring thrills, it's almost a disappointment that Aliens is merely very good when it comes to the action set-pieces. The big alien ambush at the center of the movie is exciting, the facehugger attack is tense, and the marines' last stand against the xenomorph warriors is a great example of controlled mayhem. These scenes, however, don't have quite the polish I expect from Cameron action. It isn't until the last thirty minutes or so of the film, when Ripley begins her battle with the Alien Queen, that Aliens' action takes off. That final chunk of sustained action is the first taste the world got of just how special a director James Cameron could be. When Ripley steps out of the elevator, a giant gun in hand, the movie surges into overdrive. The Alien Queen is a brilliant concept in and of herself, and Cameron's direction of the entire sequence is superb. He saves his best for last, and introduces himself as a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood.<br/><br/>It may sound blasphemous to some, but I think Aliens is crying out for a George Lucas-style special edition. Don't get me wrong, the alien effects by Stan Winston are great. The warrior xenomorphs are frighteningly designed and mostly free in their movements. The Alien Queen is one of the great large scale puppets in film history, an iconic creature. The effects work. But they aren't perfect. There is a crudeness to many of the effects. The miniatures sometimes look like toys, the xenomorphs sometimes move stiffly, and there are often visible wires and other mechanisms. It hampers what Cameron can do with the action. I think a conservative use of CGI would enhance the film, and liberate it from the constraints of the era and the film's small budget. Aliens was so ambitious, it deserved a bigger budget and more polished effects.<br/><br/>The movie, as is, still rocks. The story is simply a stroke of genius, and the action is bolstered by a powerhouse performance by Sigourney Weaver. Aliens represents the transitional period of James Cameron's career, from enterprising low-budget fare to monumental event movies. There are moments of greatness in Aliens, even if the general unvarnished quality sticks like a pebble in its shoe. The structure of the film and its ""in-your-face"" attitude carry the day, but even so, I find myself imagining how breathtaking the movie might have been if Cameron made it with the resources available to him in the 1990s or 2000s. Despite my few nagging hangups with Aliens, the movie deserves its status as an action classic. Watching it with modern eyes, I can't call it a masterpiece, but I can call it a damn good time at the movies. Aliens is not a state-of-the-art thrill ride, but even a bumpy, slightly dated roller coaster is worth riding.<br/><br/>84/100"

","I have seen a lot of films in my day, and I can say without hesitation that I consider this is the best action film ever made...<br/><br/>""Aliens"" has it all, suspense, horror, solid acting, cool hardware, breathtaking effects....you name it. The quality of this film is most evident in how well it has aged. If watched today, it does not feel like a 30+ year old movie. In fact, I think it comes off BETTER than most modern releases because it is not infused with the CGI cancer that has become the staple of modern film making, but generally comes off lifeless and uninteresting, like watching a bad cartoon.<br/><br/>I won't go into a detailed review of the film, because I imagine everyone who enjoys this sort of genre has already seen it, probably many times.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this film in a theater, it had me on the edge of my seat like no other movie has before or since. It is that good...<br/><br/>Bill Paxton's character ""Hudson"" was a classic, with lines that I continue quoting to this day:<br/><br/>""Game over MAN! Game over!""<br/><br/>If by any chance anyone reads this who has not seen this film, by all means do so. Unfortunately ""Aliens"" is a film, far more than most, that really NEEDS the immersion of being seen on the big screen. While still good at home, something is definitely lost viewing it that way.<br/><br/>I pray this is a film that Hollywood, greedy for money and with few original ideas, never tries to remake. Any attempt to remake this movie today would result in another CGI atrocity that would suck.<br/><br/>Enough praise. Simply a great film."

When Hudson is moaning about being short, you could tell all the military in the audience by their understanding moans in return. It starts out slowly and then explodes with action and violence.

"daryahorenko","10","1","3","26 May 2018"," Aliens > Alien > Other Movies
","Aliens > Alien
I don't wanna make Alien sound bad, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. EVER. And it just gets better on rewatching. Alien was directed by Ridley Scott, one of my favorite directors. Aliens was written and directed my James Cameron, also one of my favorite directors. Both are suspenseful beyond your imagination. While Alien is a little better than Aliens in regards to story and originality, these are just some of the reasons Aliens is superior to Alien:
1) It introduces my favorite Alien character, Rebecca ""Newt"" Jorden. It's the only Alien movie she appears in and she has a LOT of screentime in Aliens. Carrie Henn was an amazing casting choice for her character. She gives one of the best, if not the best child performance I've ever seen in a movie (and yes, I've seen The Shining and I know that Danny Lloyd is amazing in it. You can feel her emotions through every ounce of her facial expressions, voice and actions. It's so so sad that she didn't pursue an acting career.
2) They got Ripley even better than in Alien. I love how James Cameron always puts very strong women in his movies and she is such a badass in Aliens.
3) Alien doesn't have a twist like Alien does. The twist that there's a xenomorph queen is awesome. I thought that xenomorphs are the coolest-looking creatures in all of science fiction, but this thing looks even better!
4) Alien has a great finale, but the finale of Aliens is the absolute best and I couldn't take my eyes away both times I saw it.
5) Aliens contains my favorite line from the entire saga: ""Get away from her, you bitch!""
6) Despite not having something like a big theme, the score of Aliens is even better than the score of Alien.<br/><br/>Aliens is the best movie of all time in my opinion.
And now that I've seen both the theatrical version and the director's cut I can say that the theatrical version is better. I like the director's cut's addition that Ripley has a daughter who died while she was in hypersleep, but I like that Rebecca's first scene is not in the theatrical version. It slows the movie down a little bit."

"Dutch90","9","1","3","2 April 2018"," James Cameron's Action Packed Follow-Up To Alien
","What makes each Alien film interesting to watch is the series' tradition of going in a completely different direction with each installment. Aliens, arguably, is of greater influence to the series than the original Alien. Whereas Alien provided the foundations - the Alien design and biology, the greedy Weyland-Yutani corporation trying to exploit it - Aliens does a lot of world building and greatly expands the series' lore. Looking at the vast swath of expanded universe comics, books and video games, most are more closely based on Aliens than Alien, featuring Alien Hives, Colonial Marines and of course the vicious Queen, arguably James Cameron's most important contribution to the Alien universe. <br/><br/>In some ways, Aliens's approach as a sequel is somewhat simplistic. Think one Alien is bad? Here's a whole nest of them, along with a bigger, badder leader to sweeten the deal. But as with the original, the brilliance lies not in the concept itself, but in the execution. Where Ridley Scott turned B-list material into an A-list classic, James Cameron turned Aliens from what could have been a run-of-the-mill 80s sci-fi/action romp into an epic action adventure that definitely deserves to be listed as one of the cinematic highlights of the decade. <br/><br/>Having survived Alien, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is now the relentless Alien slayer she has become known as, although Cameron and Weaver never forget to remind us that she is still human, vulnerable both physically and psychologically as she deals with her trauma from the first film, as well as the loss of her daughter, who passed away while she drifted through space for 57 years. Being 'marooned in time', torn away from her familiar surroundings and essentially an outsider in a hostile new world, would - despite the revolving cast of writers and directors as the series progressed - become a recurring theme in the series. Cameron takes a great risk in introducing a child - Newt - into the fray. Generally, putting a child in danger in an adult story is a cheap way to raise the stakes, liable to bog down the seriousness of the drama. It's also become a bit of a cliche ('Jurassic Park Syndrome'). Fortunately, Weaver's connection with Carrie Henn - who never acted before or after this film, and has since become a schoolteacher, making her one-off performance here all the more impressive - helps raise the Ripley-Newt relationship to something meaningful. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast are fairly one-note, although the cast play that particular note very well. Highlights are the creepy, ambiguous android Bishop (played to perfection by Lance Henriksen, who has become somewhat of a fixture in the Alien expanded universe), the cowardly Hudson (played by the late Bill Paxton), everyman grunt Hicks (played by Cameron mainstay Michael Biehn) and of course the feisty Vasquez (who, in what would be quite controversial now, is played by white actress Jenette Goldstein in makeup). The everyman approach from Alien works less well with soldiers, although this may be by European bias as the military is not as much a part of everyday life here as it is in America (as in, you're far less likely to know someone in the military here). <br/><br/>Being more effects-heavy than the original film, Aliens looks more dated and is firmly entrenched in 80s culture and design. The Aliens themselves look a little less impressive this time around, mainly because a lot more of them had to be created for this film. I'm also not a fan of the 'ribbed' head design, created when Cameron removed the smooth skull dome because it kept cracking. The Queen more than makes up for this however, with a fearsome design that takes the best of the original creature and expands and builds on it to create a truly menacing beast. The final confrontation with Ripley goes down as one of the most memorable showdowns in cinematic history. <br/><br/>Aliens wouldn't be a mainstream 80s action film without that era's distinct militarism. However, unlike jingoistic one-man-army features of the time, often starring Schwarzenegger or Stallone (e.g. Commando, Rocky IV, etc), Aliens has a more critical tone when one reads between the lines. For all the military porn filling the screen in early scenes, these overconfident battle-hardened marines - 'ultimate bad-asses', as Hudson says) - get thoroughly wrecked by what are, for all intents and purposes, mere animals armed not with guns and missiles, but simply claws and teeth (and acid blood). Which serves as a fitting allegory to Vietnam, where Americans - considered, especially by themselves, to be the ultimate military force in the world - were humbled by an enemy considered far beneath them in every way. Which also goes to say that all the military power in the world doesn't hold a candle to Mother Nature."

","Although, Aliens is an exceptional movie, its puzzling to notice the abundance of fans that think its surpasses the original. That said, James Cameron remained remarkably faithful to Scott's masterpiece with its dark, violent tone. The characters although more memorable than other films, seemed to be a bit too dramatic and colorful, which takes the viewer out of the doom and gloom atmosphere. While the writing was down in that aspect, the story-line was really tense and flowed really nicely. What Cameron is best known for though is his visual effects made for the big screen in theaters. The action sequences, space scenes and scenes with the queen bee were incredible and still hold up today. Aliens is highly enjoyable but from a film standpoint, and fits great in the Alien universe, it just can match the girt Scott's film had."

It's a story about a rescue mission with a lot of gunfire, people die, and more aliens that you could ever dreamed of. It's also have more intense moments, more character development as you hate or love some of the character along the way. But if you think this is less scarier than Alien, well it's not. Aliens contains the same horror Alien gave us. It never gets old of seeing a baby Xenomorph jump to people face or people's chest bursting Aliens.

","You've gotta hand it to Cameron and his zest for strong female characters. Even in a movie full of hardcore marines (especially Jeanette Goldstein), it's Sigourney Weaver who gets the real crowd- pleasing moments. Ripley doesn't have the muscles or the training, but she's got baggage and maternal instincts. Her taping together of the flamethrower and pulse rifle is one of my all-time favorite gear-up scenes. It's short, but emotionally driven. She even gets the best line of the movie: ""Get away from her, you B----!"" Seriously, you take her young and you've got a bloodthirsty ursine on your hands. <br/><br/>But that's just the sweet spot. ALIENS has pretty much everything going for it. It's a brilliant mix of action sci-fi and war movie, and an excellent bit of escapism. It's amazingly paced and the action is unrelentingly tense. Reiser is sleaze of the highest order (to go along with the slimy Weyland-Yutani Corporation), and the whole cast in this thing just feels perfectly chosen. But the really cool thing about the movie is that, even though I've seen this movie many many times and know all the beats, it doesn't fail to entertain and keep the pulse pounding.

After being rescued following the events of 'Alien', Ripley is asked by Burke to guy back to the planet with a team of marines to find out what happened to a communication signal on the planet.<br/><br/>The story keeps itself simple much like the original 'Alien'.

The characters in the movie had far more dialogue and awesome moments that in the end, when they were killed, we missed them more Apart from turning 'Aliens' into an action movie, James Cameron masters one other thing about this movie and that is making Ripley a more developed character. I tend to look at the Ripley from 'Alien' to the Ripley in 'Aliens' as the difference between a prokaryotic cell and a eukaryotic cell. The eukaryotic cell is a more defined and developed structure and this is exactly what Ripley is in this movie. In the first one, she was just a girl. Here, we figure out she was a mother and that she lost the last thing worth living for in her life- her daughter.<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie is how Cameron turned into a great action movie. We now know that the aliens actually work like a hive; that they have a queen alien that ""runs the whole show"". The whole film is really filled with so many intense moments. The first ten minutes are worth the entry fee if they were to re-release this movie in theatres. Unlike 'Alien', which bores you in the first 10 minutes, this film is quick, scary and brilliant. The queen alien at the end of the movie is just one frightening thing. The designs behind it were great and the final result of it is just brilliant. The special effects for the whole movie are amazing and this seriously is one of the best movies of the '80's.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie would literally be the whole movie but the last 20 minutes or so of the movie are so character-defining moments of the movie such as Bishop and Ripley. That final showdown between the queen alien and Ripley was absolutely awesome but one thing that would've made the scene even better, to make it have a deeper tone to it, would be to have included some score. The frustrating thing about it is that after the alien falls down the hole to its presumed death, they then add some intense music whilst Ripley is trying to close down the hole. That music to the final battle would've been pretty cool but its nothing too big to ruin it.<br/><br/>'Aliens' is a must see for any movie as it contains superb acting, superb characters, great writing and special effects, awesome action sequences and great mix between light hearted tone to a more serious tone. I order any who have not seen this movie to see it, at least for the final showdown between Ripley and the queen Alien....Do it, you won't regret it!"
"alviansendy","10","1","3","27 November 2012"," good movie
","i vote 10 for this movie because it was amazing movie in 1986. i couldn't imagine the director could make that movie in that era because the technology looked very good and amazing. i watched two movie others made by James Cameron like Titanic and avatar, but they made in 1997 and 2009. The acting is good especially from Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser(as Carter Burke) and Lance Henriksen (as the robot). Sigourney's Ripley is such a strong woman, that even put shame to men (somehow I feel this is quite unbelievable, because she has got so much energy, especially the scene where she gets back to the Alien's Queen hatch to save Newt and fought the Alien's Queen alone with the machine. The sound and set earned them two well-deserved Oscars. the special effect was very good too. Overall this movie is very good."

","Is it that good? Yeah it is.<br/><br/>I remember the first time I watched it on TV back in the nineties. I dropped in on the movie the minute the Aliens make their first attack on the marines. Wow. Never did a movie had such an impact on me. Since that day I have probably seen it 30 times and bought it on every format (you're welcome FOX) I love the fact that a Canadian filmmaker makes a film which is basically a protest to warfare and the comparison to mainly the Vietnam war. The kind of warfare that we still can relate to these days (sadly).<br/><br/>But the film also approaches themes like ""facing your fears"" (Ripley) and ""corporate bastards"" (Burke).<br/><br/>The other day someone asked me: ""What makes a movie a classic?"".<br/><br/>I answered: ""It should stand the test of time, it has to be innovative in it's filming and in it's storytelling and to me personally I think it is Aliens!""."
"Red-Barracuda","8","1","3","22 July 2012"," James Cameron skilfully adds action to the Alien formula
","One of the things that makes Aliens a successful sequel to Alien is that it isn't a mere copy of the original. In much the same way that Sam Raimi kept his 'Evil Dead' series alive and interesting through every instalment by simply adding a new genre type to the mix, this film adds action to the basic sci-fi horror template. But it isn't done in a silly gimmicky way. The action angle is entirely justifiable within the context of the story where we have a Special Forces group return to the infamous planet in order to make war with the aliens. In fact, much like the original Predator, Aliens is a perfect amalgamation of the action, science fiction and horror genres.<br/><br/>This was the first time that director James Cameron had been given serious money to make a movie. His previous film The Terminator had been very successful but was much lower budget. With Aliens he was able to indulge in the special effects heavy style that would go on to typify his career. Additionally, this one also displays Cameron's distinctive feminist leanings that almost all his other movies have, where we have a strong independent woman at the heart of an action movie. With these two angles of feminism and action, Cameron has been able to appeal to a very wide demographic of people, which partly explains his movies enormous financial successes. I would have to say that Aliens is probably the best Cameron ever got. Because while it displays all the above characteristics, it also contains an awful lot of brilliant and sinister ideas that form a part of the 'Alien' franchise. It's here where we first see the creatures attacking en mass, we also see the horrific human 'nests' for the first time (although the director's cut of Alien did include this later) and we also encounter the queen alien. All the ideas are brilliantly brought to the screen with excellent special effects. While the story itself, while lacking the intrigue of the original, is well paced and more than serviceable. It has the usual angle of the evil of the big business corporation having underhand goals that are completely at odds with the welfare of the crew, while it also brings in a new theme of motherhood where Ripley protects Newt against the Queen and her nasty brood.<br/><br/>All-in-all, superior stuff. As high-octane action movies go this is about as good as you get. For my money it's an excellent companion piece to the original film. It complements Alien, while staying true to it."
"shreyankmankani20","10","1","3","30 June 2012"," I loved it and its and Awesome movie
","Very Good movie...Nothing more to say about it...Its just AWESOME!!! It's complete package of best: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul.I rate Aliens a perfect 10. This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you."
"Sharkey360","10","1","3","16 June 2012"," Aliens is a classic!
","I watched once again Aliens and even though the film is over 25-years- old, it still is a GREAT film to watch all thanks to James Cameron and his team. The film is not just a sequel to the 1979 film by Ridley Scott but also a reflective story as well. <br/><br/>Think about it. Cameron stated that the Vietnam War was an influence on Aliens not just with the presence of soldiers but also with Ripley agreeing to go back to the world where her crew (who died one by one) visited and discovered a place of many alien eggs. Ripley's role as an observer parallels the acts of some real life Vietnam War veterans who, despite their nightmarish experiences during the war, returned to Vietnam in a totally different manner.<br/><br/>As for why Aliens stands out nicely among other action films of the 1980s...it is SUBVERSIVE of the cinematic trends of the decade.<br/><br/>Think about it. In Aliens, there were these highly trained and brave soldiers who easily symbolized the Gung-Ho militarism culture of 1980s action cinema. Like Rambo, these soldiers were macho and had deadly firepower with them. Yet in the film, you see that they were helpless when they encountered the aliens. <br/><br/>Behind it all, Cameron inserted a strong mother-and-daughter relationship between Ripley and the young girl Newt. While she was lost in space, Ripley lost her daughter to old age. Newt lost her parents to aliens. Of course, none of Ripley's scenes would have happened without the incredible dramatic performances from Sigourney Weaver who truly deserved her Oscar nomination in this film. From a survivor to a mother and a fighter, Sigourney Weaver is excellent.<br/><br/>Finally, the film's aliens (xenomorphs) are very well done even though a different creative team worked on it. It's great to see how James Cameron and his team came up with clever ways to present the aliens as numerous despite their limited resources. A lot of research was done and special attention to detail was made too. <br/><br/>Overall, Aliens is a classic!"
"Ponzi_Baby_Xx","10","1","3","13 June 2012"," One of The Best Sci-Fi Movies Ever
","Aliens is a masterpiece in it's category. All elements of this movies line up to make the perfect sci-fi movie and Sigourney Weaver tops it all off! She's so engaged in this movie (and all of the Alien movies) that I often found myself rooting for her and Newt and actually being frightened whenever they were in danger. This is a sensation I don't experience in many new movies, sci-fi, action, comedy or otherwise. This movie lets you form emotional connections to the characters and this is what makes a movie magnificent in my opinion. I'm only 17 years old and I know I haven't had the chance to watch all of the sci-fi classics out there but this has got to go on the top of the list. Some people believe that this was to different from Alien, and that they didn't like it because it was too adrenaline fueled. To me this was a perfect shift. In this movies predecessor, the element of horror came from not knowing where the Alien was located or being able to understand it. In Aliens however the terror comes from an all together different source, so the filmed adapted accordingly and it was just as brilliant as the quiet almost-psycho-thriller that Alien was, because the human psyche and reaction to fear and the unknown played a major part in Alien. The human desire to persevere, dominate and to survive conquered in Aliens and it came off brilliantly. All-in-all Aliens is riveting and compelling while at the same time not trying too hard."
"rebecca-ry","10","1","3","8 June 2012"," How a sequel should be made
","'Aliens' is the sequel to 'Alien', made seven years later it is still known for being a great example for how a sequel should be made.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Sigourney Weaver returns and really makes the character her own. Simply because her character now has more lines and more screen time in general. In 'Alien' she was the main character but did not have as many scenes, in this she is the definite main character and performs well. New characters like that of Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton are brilliant. Paxton in particular is probably the best in the film and provides a lot of comic effect in the film. <br/><br/>The script is quite different from its prequel. 'Alien' was considered as a sci-fi horror film, this is more of a sci-fi action. James Cameron has made this sequel very well and leaves but a few questions we had from 'Alien' unanswered. The script is a lot more fast-moving and exciting, there are a few scenes where the dialogue is quite cliché' but most of the dialogue is fine. <br/><br/>Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film. If you have not seen 'Alien' you should watch it before watching this it is supposed to follow straight on from the events of the previous film. A classic film and is just as popular today as it was in 1986."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","1","3","7 June 2012"," A Gasoline-Drenched, Chain-Smoking Semi-Spiritual Successor
","Suspenseful and terrifying like the original, but in completely different ways. Where Ridley Scott's first film was loaded up with atmosphere, exploration and an overwhelming sense of terrified wonder at the habits of an unfamiliar life form, James Cameron's sequel is faced with the task of expanding upon a theme that's already been fairly thoroughly prodded. Dropping the intellectual angles and dramatic pauses in favor of unbridled, run-and-gun chaos, it still manages to feel akin to its predecessor via more than a monster suit and lead actress. While Aliens doesn't take as much time to appreciate the sights, they're still around, and they remain excellent examples of on-screen world building. The power of the aliens themselves seems very diminished - they're little more than waves of cannon fodder by the second act - but Cameron compensates with a bold determination to examine them as a versatile breed of fauna. Although its dalliances into action tripes can be distracting, and a few lines of dialog are eyeball-spinningly cheeseball, the film is still a success. How much of that is due to its young director's touch, rather than the power of the galaxy that had been established in the original, is open for debate."
"PhillipMichaelH","10","1","3","4 June 2012"," A very worthy follow up to a horror classic and also one of the best action movies of the 80s.
","There have been many debates over the years about which is the better film, Ridley Scott's 1979 original or James Cameron's 1986 sequel. In this review, I will state something that I'm sure has been said before but wanted to share my voice.<br/><br/>Released in the summer of 1986, at a time when film goers were wanting more action in their movies, along comes James Cameron who after a big disappointment with his first feature, B movie sequel Piranah 2: The Spawning (1981), Cameron went off and wrote a screenplay that would become his big breaking point in the business. The Terminator (1984) was a very ambitious project for such a low budget film. The film was a well made and groundbreaking feature in what was expected to be just another exploitation film. There were big action sequences, a challenging story and also, strong character development that surprised everyone and became a huge hit.<br/><br/>After the success of The Terminator, Cameron made his third feature film with Aliens. Cameron was a big admirer of Scott's original that he always wanted to make a follow up, his dream had now come true. Cameron wrote the screenplay and also directed. He knew from the get go that he was making a sequel and never denied that but the challenge in making a sequel is how do you make one that stands on its own but doesn't completely stay too far away from what made the original so effective.<br/><br/>Cameron not only gives us a new and different visionary look into the story by making it less claustrophobic and more out in the open, an action film more or less, but also takes the character of Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) to new heights and goes deeper into the character. I chose to not give too much away in reviews for fear that I would be giving too many details to those who haven't seen the film but Aliens is an amazing sequel to what already was an amazing first film.<br/><br/>There is so much strong metaphor in this film about how to fight the evils of the world. That not only being strong but also having faith and trust in one another is the best way to triumph at the end of the day. There are some repeats of plot devices in the film (again, Cameron realizing that he is making a sequel) but it doesn't completely remake a scene from the first film. He provides humor, adventure and action but there is always a purpose, to move the story forward. Not one scene feels out of place or doesn't belong.<br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver received an Oscar nomination for her work here and I will say, deserved it very much. I always thought she was a talented actress, I knew it right away from watching the first Alien but I would argue that she has more to work with this time around and give us a look deeper into one of the smartest and bravest characters in any science fiction movie.<br/><br/>James Cameron has gone onto bigger things and by the way, I really loved Titanic (1997), but The Terminator and Aliens were a perfect example of a good screenwriter and ambitious director. While Cameron may be demanding and somewhat of a perfectionist and it's something that I don't relate to and in fact, something that I have been critical of, but every director is different and I guess if you were working in the filming conditions that he does, I guess you and I would be to. Aliens is great entertainment but never for the sake of great entertainment. Highly recommended. Well, I can say that it's better then Predator (1987)."
"BeatleFloydZeppelin","9","1","3","11 April 2012"," More action than horror, but still great!
","This movie is more of a action movie than a horror film like the first alien movie, however this is not necessarily a bad thing. While Alien was one of the most frightening movies ever made, Aliens is one of the most entertaining film ever made! Rarely is there a sequel so different but so satisfying as this one. <br/><br/>ACTING: 9/10<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is better than Alien. The space marines are all unique and have wonderful chemistry with each other. Highlights include Bill Paxton as the hilarious Pvt. Hudson and Sigourney Weaver who plays a more likable Ripley. Carrie Henn plays my favorite character Newt to perfection. It is a shame that she quit acting after Aliens, which remains her only role in a movie.<br/><br/>WRITING: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Most action movies are cheep cash ins with little value other than one time entertainment. Thankfully, this movie has a plot behind it and well written characters. Some have complained that this movie has too many clichés without realizing that many of these clichés come from directly copying plot points in this movie. Great writing, however I must take a half point off though for the predictable ending. <br/><br/>DESIGN: 10/10<br/><br/>Although H. R. Giger wasn't directly involved with this movie, he was definitely in mind. His aliens and sets return, as do some new designs such as the queen alien done by James Cameron himself. The planet station and space ships are also well done, and are unique to the one in the first film.<br/><br/>EFFECTS: 9/10<br/><br/>Similar to Alien, most of the effects in this movie are done before the camera and look realistic. The first time I face hugger scene I was amazed with how realistic it moved, which was achieved by pulling the creature backwards and reversing the shot. A simple and excellent effect that worked very well. The film does suffer slightly from the lack of alien costumes. In fact, there were only 6 suits created for the film, and most of them were meant only for long shots. This is usually well hidden, however there are a few scenes where the amount of aliens on screen is a bit underwhelming.<br/><br/>MUSIC: 8.5/10<br/><br/>The soundtrack is slightly louder than alien, to fit the action a bit more. The only problem with this is when the music swells a bit too much, it becomes too in your face. However, when the music is slow and in the background, it adds greatly to the film.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest action movies ever created. Not quite as good as the very different Alien film, but still wonderful and exciting to watch. I give it a 9.2/10"

","How often is a sequel better than the previous part?<br/><br/>Happening after Ellen Ripley woke up after 57 years in Hyper Sleep, Aliens a sequel to Alien (1979 directed by Ridley Scott) and was directed by James Cameron, who had just finished working on The Terminator at the time and was interested in doing a sequel to the Alien. He wrote a 45 page story and presented it to Fox and he was giving a deadline and minimal budget of 18 million to meet a release date of 1986.<br/><br/>After ten months of production, Cameron finally did it and met the production date after having to deal with issues with filming methods in England where the movie was filmed.<br/><br/>Also the issue that Fox wanted to go ahead and do the movie without Sigourney Weaver, who wanted to be paid $ 1 million dollars for the role, in which she played 7 years before for 30 times less. After a lot of dispute Fox caved and paid her the sum, and Cameron adjusted to filming in England, the movie Alien II was made and was a commercial success and a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>The difference between Alien and Aliens (Alien II) is the genre, while the former was more of horror with some action; Cameron opted for a more action movie (taking cue from The Terminator which was a success). The actions in the movie kicks off from the get go, after some introductions and setup towards the flight back to LV-426, the planet where Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and her crew first encountered the Alien eggs from the moment they land things started to happen.<br/><br/>Ripley was called on as a consultant, to escort a crew of marines to LV-426 which was now home to a terraforming colony, a colony that has not been heard from for a while.<br/><br/>As usual the same way Alien by Ridley Scott went so did this one, there was mayhem, there were killings, there was betrayal and of cause there was action far more action than the predecessor.<br/><br/>Aliens is a film I recommend, and it is going to keep you glued to your sit. A lot more improvement was done to the graphics and the Aliens were given close range shots and we get to see them move, unlike the previous version where the Alien were being done using mainly camera work and lighting.<br/><br/>This film had great cinematography done by Adrian Biddle, who did the cinematography for V for Vendetta (2006) and was also involved in the camera work in Alien.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a movie to see."

I have to say that it is one of my all time favorite sequels, it's every bit as good as the first one, the characters and storyline are engaging, and leave you at the edge of your seat. I put it up there with Terminator 2, and the Borne movies as an excellent sequel, they just don't make them like this anymore! Would love to see a sequel to a movie today that has the same thought and creativity put into it as the older sequels did. I think around 1991 they just stopped trying."

Soon after this she learns, that the communications are off, so she must go to a rescue mission with some gun-ho marines.<br/><br/>After some pretty boring character introduction scenes the action gears hit in and the latter half of the story is edge seating action with very little resemblance on the gripping horror of the first story.<br/><br/>The special effects are great and the aliens have been multiplying in the numbers, though it seems, that this time they aren't half as mean and lean killing machines than the sole monster was in the original film. Out of the new aliens the queen is very nicely designed and executed little monster, though the portrayal of aliens as an ant community kind of group feels a bit cheap shot.<br/><br/>All in all, Aliens delivers in action what it lacks from the story and characters. Ripley is tougher and more clearly a hero than she was in the first film and the rest of the crew is more in the part of clichéd statistics to be killed off in some part of a film. James Cameron again shows, that he knows how to direct."
"devin_holden","10","1","3","23 June 2007"," Reinventions of Sorts
","Movies of the mid 80's and on before this age were always very good but aways seemed to lack one thing which never quite made them truly memorable (to me anyways), a climax of gripping proportions with tension that prevents your eyes from blinking even for a second. A feeling that sticks with you long after you've left the theatre or your couch. This feeling can be unsettling, uneasy, shocked, shaken or inspirational but the one thing that counts is that it's unlocked something in you that only it can do. For me Aliens was the first movie of it's kind to do this effectively even the space opera of star wars never amounted to this kind of humanity and character depth.<br/><br/>One line that really does this for me and i think many people forget or don't notice to the extend it is intend is after the Queen is blown out of the colonial marine ship newt turns to Ripley pludging herself into her arms and calls her mother. If you had not seen this movie at first you would find this abit weird because Ripley isn't her mother? Yet it works for one reason the character development that you witness through out the movie between these characters and the hardships both of them have survived. They are two lone survivors of horrifying world and it is through this bond that they are brought together.<br/><br/>This though is only a taste of the depth you can find in viewing aliens and for anyone who looks only for the action or scares should not be watching these events unfold for without these conflicts of heart pounding aw this movie would just be another ""action"" movie to toss aside.<br/><br/>What James Cameron has invented here is a complete reinvention of what action is and needs to be.<br/><br/>10/10 a solid near perfect vision of human conflict"

","Debates may rage on as to whether Aliens is actually a better film than Alien, and I'm of two minds myself on it myself, but regardless of the conclusion, one thing is clear -- they are both exemplary works of science fiction cinema. Ultimately, where you stand will probably have more to do with what kinds of movies you have a preference for. If you like intelligent, absorbing sci-fi and atmospheric horror, Alien is the choice. If you like adrenaline-charged action and mind-blowing special effects, Aliens gets the nod. Or if you're anything like me, and love both styles of movies, you'll be in for a treat, as both films are near the tops of the list no matter which way you try to slice it.<br/><br/>Aliens is the right way to do a sequel. It carries the storyline where the first film leaves off, and rather than regurgitate the formula, it takes the story into a new direction, and does so without ever losing momentum in the process. There is also a maturation in the characters, all of whom change as the film drives forward, rather than stay stuck in shallow stereotypes. Ripley (Weaver, Ghostbusters) started off Alien as your average woman who is thrust into bravery out of necessity, and this trend continues, seeing her go the distance in becoming a full-fledged soldier in doing what's right (from a humanistic point of view). Even the supporting characters change on a smaller scale, with the diminutive Newt learning that she can trust someone again, while the big-talking' Hudson (Paxton, Apollo 13) eats a bit of humble pie once he gets a taste of how dominating the menace truly is. This isn't just great action, it's terrific character development, and while the technical aspects do leave a lasting impression, it's really the quality screen writing by Cameron that allows the film to pay off in a large way as the film heads toward its explosive conclusion."

Bill Paxton has never been better, as the bad ass-marine, who gets a nervous breakdown and gets all paranoid, when he faces the enemy. The only thing lacking in ALIENS, is the creepiness which made ALIEN scary as hell.

","A worthy sequel to the original and a large part of James Cameron's resume, but I found the original Alien much better. Perhaps it's because I prefer horror to action, but I just found that film much more effective; but still, this is a great flick, with superb action and a great story to boot. The interaction between the characters makes this film work, for instance, much better than a typical action flick. The marines all act like marines, Ripley's gradual development works, and the mother/daughter relationship feels genuine. And then, of course, there's the aliens - one of them was scary in the original, so hundreds of them is downright terrifying. The end fight with the queen is a bit melodramatic, but it's a fitting conclusion to the film. Add in some great performances by Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biehn, and Bill Paxton, and you've got a terrific flick."

What's more, make it a whole slew of aliens when she knows better than anyone what just one can do. And while you're at it, remind her there are families involved so she will spend every waking moment and every breathless nightmare picturing what they are enduring. Paint her into a corner so she really has no choice, and send her with a bunch of cocky marines who have no clue what they have signed on for. Oh, but Ripley knows. Ripley knows all too well.

I have seen it several times but every time I see it is like the first time and still makes me jump at some parts. Either rent or buy this movie. Don't pass it up because it is a classic and passing it up would be an awful mistake. It is overall great and has extraordinary actors. This is sci fi at its best. It still ranks in my personal top ten favorite movies."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","1","3","18 September 2005"," Nowhere near as good as the original
","James Cameron's militaristic sequel to Alien lacks all of the qualities that made the original so special. This movie is all about gunfights and splattering the sets with alien guts. There are no subplots or interesting characters just a bunch of macho military lug heads with foul mouths and big guns. There is no science as there was in the original. This is just a war movie with aliens. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver returns and straps on a big one. Paul Reiser is completely miscast and doesn't transfer from TV to film. Aliens is an overblown and highly overrated film from an overblown and highly overrated director."

","(This is concerning Aliens: Alien 2, Special Edition version from the Alien Quadrilogy Collector Set)<br/><br/>Some 57 years later, Ripley is discovered on a deep salvage expedition. She is in stasis, but is alive, rescued, and brought back to Earth to face an inquiry as to what happened to her $42.5M M-class freighter and cargo, her crew, and her mission.<br/><br/>James Cameron was one brave soul to attempt a follow up to Scott's horror classic. There were so many ways he could have screwed this up, and been loathed by literally millions of fans. <br/><br/>It's been said that it's easy to take someone else's good idea and improve upon it, but were that the case, there would be loads of superior sequels out there, and very few of the quality we actually do have.<br/><br/>What Cameron's done with Scott's vision is to expand upon it in such a way that the original is surpassed in almost every way. Understanding all too well that action is his best venue (Escape from New York, Rambo 2, The Terminator, etc), he chose in sheer wisdom, to stick with his forte rather than attempt to copy Scott's. Very shrewd of Mr. Cameron. So while the first chapter of the Alien saga is very much a science-fiction/horror, this second installment is just as much a science-fiction/action which expounds on Scott's story and ideas in such a way as to render this attempt superior to its forbearer. A rarity in cinematic attempts.<br/><br/>The story is rich in detail and depth. Written by Cameron, it flows rather fluidly from the end of Alien, right on into the Aliens plot line with only a small seam (Ripley's inquest and subsequent time on Earth) interrupting the two separate pages of encounter. Once the action begins, it is not non-stop, but it is fluent in its execution. The non-action sequences are rich in character development and deepening the base story and sub-plots.<br/><br/>The camaraderie of the military characters was beautifully realistic, giving us a sense of knowing them, caring about what happens to them, and having empathy for their plight. <br/><br/>The ~only~ element in the entire endeavor I had any problem with whatsoever was the addition of the character Rebecca ""Newt"" Jorden, brilliantly portrayed by Carrie Henn. While she was a delight, and a very capable actress at this age, she also felt like a token; a wild card character through which they hoped to endear a younger audience. But with an ""R"" rating, that ploy did not necessarily fulfill their goal, and had the adverse effect of making some parents wonder how anyone could allow a child of that age to take part in a movie so gruesome. This is, after all, the stuff of nightmares. I, however, was not one of those people. I loved Newt and found her presence in this work necessary and desirable. Henn was nothing but professional in her portrayal, giving us an open and honest portrayal of real terror.<br/><br/>This chapter of the Alien story gives you more Aliens, more gore, more action, more characters, more story, and more enjoyment. It is the best of the Quad, and that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"cheapdate","Null","1","3","14 October 2003"," No sir, I don't like it
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>BEGIN RANT.<br/><br/>I'm one of those dissenters who loathes ALIENS, and pretty much everything else James Cameron has directed. Judging from his body of work, Cameron believes that if something is loud and showy and sentimental enough, then it's good. I disagree.<br/><br/>One of my bigger complaint about ALIENS is the characters. While the characters of the original ALIEN were flawed, they weren't unlikeable people, and their constant bickering worked for the movie, setting up tension long before the alien makes its debut. I believed in them, I cared about them, and I was sorry to see them die.<br/><br/>I admit to caring for Ripley and Newt in ALIENS--but that's because Ripley is already established from the first film, and Newt is A LITTLE GIRL, for cripe's sake. Too easy! The remaining characters, the Space Marines, are by contrast incredibly obnoxious and unprofessional in the extreme. (Here's hoping that the real US military is nothing like the way they are portrayed here.)<br/><br/>Their machismo dialogue is so dreadful, it's funny. Take for instance this line delivered to an hispanic Marine: ""Somebody said 'alien'; and she thought they said 'illegal alien' and signed up."" It took three people to write that?! Good grief. Little wonder that I root for the Space Marines to die. Anything to get them to shut up.<br/><br/>But my real beef with ALIENS is its utter lack of suspense. Ridley Scott's ALIEN was an elegant, Lovecraftian ghost story of a horror movie. ALIENS, of course, is an action movie instead, but that only makes it unscary and predictable. It's nothing but guns and ammo, and you know right off the bat who will live and who will die. Would it surprise anyone who hasn't seen it yet to hear that the protagonist, the adorable little girl, the hunky love interest, and the humble mechanoid are the only ones who make it out alive? Yeah, well, they are. (But here's some good news: they all die in ALIEN^3!)<br/><br/>Some other issues with the movie: the pacing that is too fast; THE LOUD NONSTOP ONLY-IN-HOLLYWOOD MUSIC THAT WILL MAKE YOUR EARS BLEED (compare to Jerry Goldsmith's spookily understated score for ALIEN); the lazy secondary special effects (my boyfriend points out that there is no way the dropship (?) would work, given that one of its wings unfolds before the other!!); and of course Paul Reiser.<br/><br/>Okay, if there is anything I do like, wholeheartedly, about ALIENS it is the aliens themselves. Giving them an insect-hive-like social structure was a masterstroke, and, although too gooey, the aliens--particularly their queen--are downright gorgeous to look at. (No surprise, with the brilliant Stan Winston adapting the designs from the brilliant H.R. Giger's original.)<br/><br/>Trouble is, there is so much of them TO look at! Cameron shows so much of the aliens that they are, ultimately, not scary. As every fan of the genre knows, the best monster is the monster that largely goes unseen.<br/><br/>And now there is ALIEN VS. PREDATOR, with Paul S. Anderson directing... Darn it.<br/><br/>END RANT."
"nickthegun","8","1","3","20 February 2003"," My personal fave of the Alien films
","Once a word that conjured up cinematic awe, it has now lost the sense of grandness it once had, through so-so sequels, merchandise, face offs against every super hero ever (even the green lantern).<br/><br/> So. Here goes my review for the last great entry into the Alien Universe.<br/><br/> Alien and Aliens. Two very different films by two very different directors. And all the better for it. Whereas the Tim Burton 'Batmans' were great, the total change in directorial style for the sequels killed the franchise dead and made it a laughing stock. Not so Aliens. Ridley Scotts and James Camerons entries into the Alien series couldn't be more different. But the one common factor is that they are both utterly superb (whereas Batman was brilliant and Batman forever sucked ass).<br/><br/> As a personal preference I prefer Aliens. Its my kind of film. Thats not to say I don't like Alien. I love it. And I can fully appreciate the view of people who think that it is the best film in the series. But I just love the balls out action of Camerons creation.<br/><br/> The film kicks off with Ripley coming out of hypersleep to discover shes spent 50 odd years in stasis. She is recovered and throughly grilled by 'the company' as to why she blew up a billion dollar spaceship. When she cant convince them that she did it to try and kill a crazy ass acid blooded alien they remove her flight license and have her shunting crates about. Then the call comes in that they have lost contact with a terraforming colony on the planet Ripley first encountered the Alien. She decides to go back to excorcise her ghosts. With a load of 'bad ass' marines.<br/><br/> The action in Aliens is, while retaining some of the suspense of the first one, superb. Its amazing to learn that there were only a grand total of 6 Alien suits used throughout the whole film!<br/><br/> The performances are uniformly good and the characters are all interesting, which is a testament to this not being a mindless action film.<br/><br/> The DVD version comes with a pretty flawless transfer and a fabulous 5.1 soundtrack. The extras are a little thin on the ground, but hey. Whatcha gonna do?"
"shawndevin","9","1","3","10 May 2001"," A sequel that is better than the original.
","The first Alien film was designed to be Sci-Fi, Gothic, Horror (the first of that genre).  James Cameron designed this film to be a Sci-Fi, War film with a little bit of horror thrown in on the side.  You never see one of our heroes or heroines die on-screen.  There is only one person who dies on-screen, and that person was only introduced to the film 2 minutes before they die.  Despite that, this is one seriously suspenseful film (particularly if you have seen Alien).  The special effects are outstanding in spite of having a lower budget than the original Alien.  I dislike horror films as a general rule, but this is one of my favorite films of all time."

","One of the very few times a sequel is better than the original film, but Aliens succeeds in being a action filled sci-fi story with a brain. Sigourney Weaver provides a tough female hero in her strong performance as Ripley.  Her difficulty dealing with the events of Alien and her determination to destroy these aliens make her enjoyable to watch.  The film is a must see for anyone who likes sci-fi or action, and will be at least enjoyable to those not familiar with sci-fi as well."

"a-11737","10","1","4","22 September 2019"," Aliens: One of my favorite sci-fi action films of all time
","Aliens came out in 1986 and was directed by James Cameron. I first watched it on Halloween of last year (at the time of me writing this), and after rewatching it on Blu-Ray, it has since become one of my favorite 80's science fiction action films, along with The Terminator and RoboCop.<br/><br/>I loved Alien (1979) when I first watched it, but Aliens is in it's own league. I love the action and the characters. My personal favorite character in Aliens is probably Vasquez, mostly because she's just so tough as nails, and is a great fighter. I also love the character of Ripley, and her relationship with Newt, who is a young girl the marines found in the colony. Their relationship feels so much like a mother-daughter relationship. it just feels so legitimate. You can tell Ripley would do anything to protect her.<br/><br/>The marines for the most part were pretty forgettable in my opinion. The only ones I actually remember are Apone, Vasquez, Hudson, and Hicks. And you can tell that Lieutenant Corman (who lead the marines at first) hadn't seen much combat. But aside from that, the action, the effects, the story, the direction, and the cinematography are outstanding in all regards. It's a very well written film. As for the action, its incredible. It's so much fun to watch these marines just blast the living heck out of the aliens, and the cinematography just makes it even better. While it's predecessor, Alien, was definitely a good horror film, Aliens is an action film. And it does a fantastic job at that.<br/><br/>That was my review of Aliens (1986). If you haven't seen it yet, definitely check it out."
"azathothpwiggins","10","1","4","27 August 2019"," ""It Won't Make Any Difference!""...
","ALIENS is one of the few sequels that actually matches or surpasses the film that spawned it. Where Ridley Scott's ALIEN was more of a suspenseful monster movie, Director, James Cameron wisely chose to make his follow-up into a fast-paced, action film w/ the titular creatures causing even more mayhem. The story picks up several years after the incidents in the original, w/ a rescued Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) going along, as a team of space marines returns to the planet where the first troubles began. It seems that something has caused a communication breakdown w/ a group of colonists there. Upon their arrival, a nearly non-stop firestorm ensues. Cameron takes what he did in THE TERMINATOR two years earlier, and ups the ante, creating an explosive masterpiece of sci-fi / horror in the process! Ripley transforms from her resourceful character in the first movie, into a warrior, bent on protecting the sole survivor of this latest holocaust. As the title suggests, there are multiple ""Xenomorphs"" to deal with, as well as a secretive, even more dangerous beast, that must be stopped at all cost. as w/ ALIEN, when this film debuted, there was nothing else like it, making it a seminal movie on its own merit, as well as a huge hit. A classic that still holds up after all these years..."

Sigourney's ""Ripley"" is better than before; Portrayed in a better way.<br/><br/>To be honest, the reason I came close to watching this movie was the MKX video game in which you can play ""Alien"" as a fighting character.

","'Titanic' 1997 is my most favourite Hollywood film, add to that 'Avatar' 2009 and ' Terminator 2: Judgment Day' 1991, it is an easy guess to make what I think of film- maker James Cameron. However, I am someone who is a bit reluctant to watch old films, however critically acclaimed they may be, just because I feel that sometimes a film may be great for the era it is made and we, the people from our generation for example, may find flaws after flaws. Although some of my all-time favourite films are from years ago but still, very few.<br/><br/>Despite this, I decided to give 'Alien' 1979 a go and it was good. I gave it eight out of 10 and admired it for the era it was made in, but this one transcends everything. This is a great film for any age and I am still not able to fully recover from it, merely thinking that this is 29 years old film. It is a tremendous and mind-blowing film! I would give it 20 out of 10. <br/><br/>Full of brilliant action, great from the technological aspect as well (particularly that device telling them how far away an alien is) and the last 30 minutes or so are gripping, thrilling in the best form and move from scene to scene with great pace.<br/><br/>The best scene from the film for me has to be that suicide hand grenade attack on that alien. Hair raising stuff and an out of the world scene!<br/><br/>Here's a salute to James Cameron!

","Simply put, Aliens after 26 years keeps standing out as THE sci-fi film, THE action film with a nice portion of horror. Instead of simply getting a sequel to the astonishing first film, Aliens goes from slow-paced horror to a slow build up to war. Sigourney Weaver is the perfect heroine, and does not become stereotypical. The supporting characters fit in, are unique, original (for its time), believable and overall very enjoyable. CGI movies of later years still have nothing on Aliens. Carefully planned details are everywhere. It's a must see for anyone enjoying movies, even if the genre isn't usually your cup of tea.

"dave-appleton-242-121346","10","1","4","22 March 2012"," Incredible emotional journey!!!
","This movie is one of the greatest sequels of all time, a masterpiece of movie making and the perfect antidote to the haunting and equally masterful Alien.<br/><br/>Firstly this movie cranks the pace up 10 fold from the suspenseful slower pace of Alien, but it is still filled with suspense and tension. The acting in the movie is top notch and Sigorney Weaver is fantastic as Ripley. The action sequences are incredible and the even in 2012 this movie has hardly dated since 1986 and could stand up against the movies today.<br/><br/>Aliens is essentially a Vietnam War movies in space, the analogy is the same and I heard somewhere that this was intentional by James Cameron. The high tech and over confident soldiers with weapons and equipment are outwitted by their perceived inferior opponents (the aliens) by their resourcefulness.<br/><br/>Despite the movies name 'Aliens', I personally believe the creatures are the focal point for the audience only on a conscious level. On a subconscious level this movie is all about Ripley's emotional journey where she is propelled into a leading role to face her nightmares brought on by her first terrifying encounter in the original movie. <br/><br/>Aliens is a story of empowerment, whereas the original Alien was a helpless struggle against an invincible enemy.<br/><br/>This empowerment is amplified by Ripley eventually facing a bigger and more fearsome version of the creature, the Alien Queen and defeating her in a wrestling match using a hydraulic power loader and eventually blowing her out of an airlock, much like the first movie.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie is Ripley's acting as a mother role to the character Newt which is relevant to the start of the movie when Ripley finds out her daughter had died at the age of 66 after she had spent 57 years in hyper sleep. This also heightens the emotional journey and when both are seen in hyper sleep at the end of the movie it resembles an up lifting union as if Ripley is back with her daughter and peacefully sleeping by her without her nightmares. Very symbolic.<br/><br/>This is why I believe it works so well as a sequel and at many levels it is as sophisticated as the original movie which is regarded by many as the most artistic of the two.<br/><br/>Aliens is a rip roaring, hardcore action/sci fi/horror, with great acting, score and pace that only James Cameron could achieve but most importantly this is a fantastic emotional story and because of this it a massive success with depth and gives the audience a sense justice!"

","After having seen Alien, I wanted to know in what way Aliens would follow up. Not surprisingly, it goes by what sequels go for- it's bigger and louder. This isn't to say it's a negative thing at all. The film started with the standard formula for action films. As it is, I wasn't feeling it in its first half very much. It definitely sounded like a James Cameron film. We have some uninteresting characters, one specifically who is the clichéd ""masculine"" female. Cameron is a much better director than writer, which is the reason why he makes up for its flaws in its second half. The action pieces here are outstanding! I don't remember such a film with as beautifully set-up set designs and visual effects as here in a long time. The action here is, excuse me for it, but out-of-this-world. You can definitely see all of the amazing work put into building this world and then having that final climax take place. <br/><br/>Overall, I was ready to say that this film is easily inferior to the first, but by the end I can only say it's a little inferior. Sure, it has a lot of the usual mediocre dialogue and characterization and a lot of the ""formulaic"" plot turns, but hey, it's so hard to really hold that against it because as it is, this is a great film. Now, is Alien 3 worth it?"
"The-Sarkologist","9","1","4","23 September 2011"," A sequel that simply does not seem to stop for a breath.
","This is the sequel to the Ridley Scott movie Alien. James Cameron has taken the original movie, kept the dark and dirty setting and added his own touches which makes James Cameron the film maker that he is. The main difference is that where the original was one alien against a crew of a freighter, this movie is thousands of aliens against a unit of US marines. Cameron does his characters quite well. Hudson (Bill Paxton) is memorable and seems to represent the general mentality of the marines. At the start he is a loud mouthed big head who thinks he is invincible because he is a marine. After the aliens attack, he becomes a scared, helpless human being who cannot handle what he us up against. Most of the marines put their faith in themselves and this collapses, especially with Hudson, when they realise that they are not as mighty as they once were. The evil of the corporation comes out in this movie as I am told it does in the original. It deals with their greed as they are interested more in capturing an Alien rather that destroying them as they are a threat. They see the aliens as a resource that could be exploited and used if controlled. Burke (Paul Reiser) is corporate representative. His character is willing to kill all of the marines and Riply, yet is against destroying the facility as it is worth a lot of money. To him a human life is worth far less than a new product for the corporation. Even though Burke is quite ruthless in his actions, we are shown that the aliens do not care who people are, they are willing to kill Burke as much as a marine. He attempts to flee, leaving the marines to their fate, only to be torn apart by an alien only minutes later. His act of cowardice was finally his downfall. Aliens also shows us that we are not in control of our world. Even though we may think that a team of crack marines can solve anything, the reality is far from it. They are trained to the point where the people in power believe that they can handle anything, but all of their training means nothing in the field. One of the marines is asked how many drops he has been on; the reply is that he has been on about thirty drops but all but two were simulated, and the current one is his second. Even though they are going out to face danger, the marines are very blasé about the whole event. When they get out of their sleeping capsules, they are more interested in joking about slippers, complaining about food, and rescuing colony girls from their virginity. When they are first told about the alien threat, Hudson's response is ""How do I get out of this chicken ... outfit"". Nobody takes the threat seriously. This reflects us. We live our lives in a very blasé way. We don't realise that death may come any minute. When we hear of the truth of Christ, our response is like Hudson's, that is get lost. We don't want to hear about the judgement Christ is going to bring to the world and are surprise when things such as earthquakes and death happen. We curse God and turn our back on him and when everything falls apart, we are ready to put a gun to our head and kill ourselves. This is clearly seen in the 1929 stockmarket crash, people throwing themselves out of windows because of the belief that all their money, the thing they based their entire life around, is gone. God is by far different. By following him does not mean that we won't suffer or die, but death does not have to be fearsome. We understand the world and realise that even though we suffer here, we will not suffer when we meet God after our death. All of the things of this world become meaningless; just because we loose all of our money does not mean we loose out. God is always there; he can never be taken away from us. What do we do, we don't take a Hudson attitude and write him off, but rather take a Riply attitude, by understanding the true nature of the threat and preparing yourself when it comes."
"elshikh4","Null","1","4","17 December 2009"," Aliens Simply = The First Alien × James Cameron !
","The title said it all. It's not one Alien this round. It's many of them. And the reason is clear; a 32-year-old man at the moment by the name of James Cameron.<br/><br/>I must admit that I respect the guy. Since his start, he added his fingerprint so visibly on the action movie-making in Hollywood. Cameron loves, just loves, the titanic look for the action. And he's so smart at making that as well. His first movies as a writer are the best when it comes to define that historically. (The Terminator - 1984) was a mix between sci-fi and straight big and loud action (Apparently after Star Wars, sci-fi became not that artistic anymore and transformed into popular mainstream hits). Then (Rambo: First Blood Part II - 1985) was the right way for how to explode a B-movie to the max, but in a good way. So they brought him to do what he already did with (First Blood), by doubling it into 10 times its action, however with a classic hit named (Alien). And he simply did it.<br/><br/>Despite the smart elements that (Cameron) put, it's the first movie's formula anew. He came just to add: Some marines; so crazy and violent; unlike the rational and scientific team of the first which externally looks boring in comparison, and so many; to be killed one by one later. A kid into the action. A daughter-mother relationship. Surprisingly a good robot this time, while keeping the conspirator member also, but after turning him into human. And, of course, dear aliens, with more scenes to see their ugliness appropriately.<br/><br/>I can't say that the Slasher movie was working finely under the surface, because to tell you the truth, there was no substance in the first place, so the slasher thing was all over it with nothing more! However, the non-stop action, the hot thrill and the solid horror, with - not to forget - the many dazzling explosions--it managed to keep things going on interestingly enough on the screen as a perfect Hollywood fare. Or the Hollywood fare thereafter. Because (Aliens) sat a new redefinition for the sci-fi action that countless next movies would follow.<br/><br/>The outrageous financial success consolidated that, since it grossed nearly quintuple its original budget: the $18,500,000. I read that just grossing double the budget is considered a lovely thing for the producers, so how about 5 times more (and that's just domestically speaking too!). Let alone the appreciation of the Academy that honored it with an Oscar for the best sound effects editing, and another for the best visual effects, with being nominated for 5 more Oscars; best original score, sound, editing, set decoration, and actress. However, despite all of that, the first is still better on all the levels.<br/><br/>The intellectual substance is so out this round. It's the exploitive sequel after all. The swearing, the violence, and the nudity (even if slightly shown) are disturbing factors for me. Plus there are holes that kill me; for instance, if the lead stayed for 57 years out of earth, then why she wasn't worried about any relative that she got or whatsoever?! It came to my knowledge lately that there was a scene about her daughter, then it got deleted. I believe for things like these, Sigourney Weaver threatened to not do any more ""Alien"" movies after seeing the movie's final cut; so as a compromise, the 1987 Special Edition was released on Laser-Disc. Over and above, the scene of forgiving (Ripley) for destroying a millions dollars facility was utterly laughable. So how about destroying new, huger, ones this time too?! But hey, that's for the fun of it anyway!<br/><br/>For me, it doesn't hit the degree of the first's top amusement. Hence, I just get sick when I read that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. It maybe contributed to define how the greatest pure action would be made. It was voted the 42nd greatest film of all time by Entertainment Weekly. Fairly they describe it as the ""greatest pure action movie ever."" It's pure indeed. After more than a decade, (Titanic) would be chosen as the 6th best big blockbuster of all time by Total Film magazine. Well, neither is sci-fi's evolution, or romantic epic. But surely they're fine action ones. And there where their noble metal exists.<br/><br/>In brief, the first had the surface and the depths. This one has a surface only; the same one of the first too. But apparently it was more refulgent. Or should I say more explosive!"
"long-ford","Null","1","4","19 February 2009"," Impressive sequel to Alien, Last hour is unbearably intense
","James Cameron goes in an entirely new direction with this sequel . Rather than make a horror movie, 'Aliens' is an all out action movie. The film starts slowly and takes it's time to set things up. However, once the action begins there is no let up, with the final hour almost unbearably intense. Sigourney Weaver makes a great female action hero. The film lacks the slow horror of the first film and the characterizations aren't as well depicted. The Special Effects are very impressive and the production design and look of the aliens is worthy of praise. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10"

Not the first movie wasn't good, I love all the alien movies, some more then others and for various reasons. But if I had to pick a favorite and say this is the best of the series, I would have to say this movie. James Cameron starts in full speed and don't stop until a great explosive climax that is worthy of me. The story is great, now for the bad news.

"martax9","5","2","13","13 September 2017"," I don't understand what all the fuss is about!
","First of all, I should start by saying I loved Prometheus and Alien: Covenant but not so much Alien and Aliens. Of course since Prometheus is a more recent film it has better special effects, sound, and even casting (for some people) I could relate to it more but that's not all. <br/><br/>I find that there are a lot of inaccuracies and plot holes that this film would be considered a B-movie if it wasn't for its originality back in the day. The girl lived and wasn't killed by the alien, only to be taken to the room containing all the eggs to supposedly become a host (?), yet everyone else was killed by the aliens. The crew members that were attacked just died and the aliens didn't multiply...and definitely didn't take them to the room with the eggs and mother...Riiiiight. Also, how did Ripley's leg manage to stay attached to her body when the mother alien was clinging to her with the air being sucked out of the ship? How did the girl who is the less able human out of all 157 colonists manage to survive there on her own while everyone else just died? What did she eat? Didn't the crew and Ripley arrive some years later? That's why they slept didn't they? I guess time on earth and time on another colony are very different but the girl probably wasn't there alone for one day only..And if she managed to hide, she would have stayed hidden for days. There were so many questions I can't count them all.<br/><br/>I think this film is so popular and well-rated because it was different from all the other films released back then, it was a breakthrough for that time, something original, scary, gripping so everyone went crazy over it and it became an instant classic. It has happened to me too so I know they psychology behind it, but I can look past that and judge films Objectively now. For example, when I was 11 I loved Charlie's angels with Barrymore, Liu and Diaz and would swear it's the best film ever, and I still like it but now I see I was just taken aback by the film's action and bad ass female casting..and that it's not so great after all. <br/><br/>I do not understand why this film has such high rating, why it's considered one of the 250 best films ever (ffs), I found it rather boring to say the least.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"

","The timeline, rules of engagement, character dynamics, and the end resolution are all fairly unsteady and vague. In the sequel to Alien, this film watches Ripley as she returns to the infested planet and attempts to correct the mistakes made by the colonists and prevent the spread of the parasites. She finds a lost girl, Newt (Rebecca) and saves her in the representation of humanity, at the expense of her shipmates and potential business opportunities for the sponsor of the trip. There plot and concept holes that gape as wide as the holes the creatures leave in the host humans chest, and the characters are not compelling beyond basic human decency. Visually the themes are strong and clean in the alien den. Overall, the movie was not a complete failure, as it does hold the attention, for the most part, excusing the issues and setting aside logical disbelief for the sake of the film."
"wisemantonofski","10","1","5","4 February 2019"," The Perfect Sequel
","This '80s sci-fi action thriller took the Xenomorphs in a new direction, upping the stakes with the simple application of an 's' in the title. The Ridley Scott original showcased the terror and chaos that can be caused by a single Alien getting loose on a ship, but the James Cameron sequel takes things to the next level. The cast, and audience, are hurled into the middle of an entire colony overrun by the terrifying creatures and it introduces the towering menace of the Alien Queen. It does everything a sequel should do, with great characters in the Marines and the returning Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), great action, suspense and intrigue surrounding the new synthetic character Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and a climax that will have you on the edge of your seat."

Aliens is everything you can want in an action film, badass characters, badass villains, edge of your seat suspense followed by sensory pounding action sequences. Theres humor, wit, great chemistry from the leads, and the special effects hold up 100% today when the movie was made in the 80s, not many films can say that. It's just a masterfully made film by james cameron who (in my opinion) hit it out of the park on everything he attempted to do with this film.

","Easily one of the best genre movies ever made, James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is the rare sequel that manages to expand all the elements that made the original film so special and build a mythology around them that feels both organic and necessary. Cameron crafts a masterpiece that combines likable characters, crowd-pleasing one-liners and an impressive array of special effects, along with top-notch visual and audio work, and delivers an exciting, genre-switching sequel that matches the original in its intensity. Sigourney Weaver's performance is powerful and charismatic, and she's well-matched by an impressive assembly of character actors guided to perfection by Cameron's deft touch with dialogue. Not to be missed by genre fans."

"delnegro-IMDb","5","1","5","5 May 2015"," A terrible plot made into a very entertaining movie
","If ever a film summed up its director, this one is it. James Cameron is a shrewd producer, an excellent director... and a terrible writer.<br/><br/>I won't include any spoilers, but a quick internet search (or even just a visit to the IMDb ""goofs"" section) will return a list of plot holes and factual errors that takes nearly as long to read as the film takes to watch (and most of them are so obvious that you WILL notice them even when watching the film for the first time).<br/><br/>And yet, despite all those internal contradictions, despite the nonsensical science and moronic military tactics, and despite the almost cartoon-like characters (or perhaps partly because of them), it's still worth watching.<br/><br/>The action sequences are fast and exciting but still easy to follow, there are several memorable one-liners, and the final confrontation is as iconic as it gets. If only it didn't take itself so seriously, maybe its flaws would come across more as a self-parody (like in Verhoeven's ""Starship Troopers"") and less as Cameron's lack of writing skills.<br/><br/>It would be unfair to give it a very high score, but if you're willing to overlook the bad plot and implausible characters, you'll probably find ""Aliens"" a very entertaining action-horror hybrid."

","I will start off my review like everyone else who thinks they are special because they are familiar with the works of a particular director. You know the types, those that like to mention the director just because they are famous. Those who badmouth them because they are well known. ""James Cameron is a good friend of mine cuz I saw four of his movies, so I have so much important insight that I must share with you. I saw Aliens before most of you people ever did, I saw it back in 1990. That was before James Carmeron was famous so I'm kind of a long-time fan of his I guess, because you know, I really liked Aliens way back in 1990 before he or the movie was popular. He's not as good a director as he used to be sez me the world's biggest J. Cameron fan. That's right, I call him J. Cameron cuz we're close friends and all. Now onto my review which is really important for you to read because I'm an American from America. Burke is evil, he is upsettingly evil. End Spoiler. I will continue this review by pretending that I am writing this while being trapped in a 24 foot deep well in my backyard. This is the last message I will ever have for my family and friends as I have been trapped in this well for three days now and am surprisingly dying of dehydration because this well was empty, oh just my luck to fall into a dry well. Anyways, from what I can remember of the James Cameron film Aliens, I remember enjoying it greatly, oh so thirsty. I hope this package of skittles can tide me over until help arrives. Aliens is truly a Cameron tour de force, oooh I like the lime ones, delicious, back in 1990 when I saw this film I thought this Cameron character is really going places, who the hell has a well in their backyard now a days, I mean come on. The suspense of this movie puts my senses in maximum overdrive, which reminds me of the movie Roadhouse which I am not familiar with. Don't wells usually contain mushrooms, bats, or roaches, there's nothing in this well but pea gravel, this sucks. And that's why the ending to Aliens was so surprising. Lance Henriksen steals the show. feel dizzy, power loader battle sequence felt tacked on...., mouth ,so dry, James Cameron save me.......tell my family about Lance henriksen.ek,.qegu;////////////"
"Krishna Manohar","Null","1","5","5 September 1999"," The most stupidest movie saga of all time.
","I never really liked the Alien saga.  The first one was a slow boring piece of celluloid.  The second film Aliens was a stupid 80's action corporate movie built to cater the dumb tastes of stupid moviegoers.  The third movie, Alien 3, however, was a stylistic and dark film.  I was finally relieved when the protagonist killed herself at the end of the film, because I was getting sick of seeing her or her pathetic acting attempts.  Alien:Resurrection was just so bad that it made the first three films seem good.  Why don't you people just drop the alien films and get a life?  Hey, why doesn't hollywood just resign and stop making films?!"

"DVR_Brale","10","1","6","3 September 2016"," Aliens has the greatest atmosphere which stays with you for a very long time
","Whenever I think of Aliens I immediately recollect and go back to the early 2000s when I first saw it. I was maybe seven or eight years old at the time. The atmosphere of Aliens captured me so much that it doesn't let me go to this very day. For a kid I myself was back then, Aliens was just another movie I had seen on TV. I didn't have any standards for what makes a great movie - I only liked it very, very much. Little did I know I would years later discover that Aliens won two Oscars and is one of the highest rated movies ever, being at great 65-th place on IMDb.<br/><br/>Aliens is may all time favorite movie. No other movie did I and do I enjoy watching so much. James Cameron was able to create such a captivating atmosphere! Who would've thought back then that James Cameron would go on to make Terminator 2: The Judgment Day, Titanic and Avatar all of which immerse you in with its story and world? Is seems that James Cameron is an all time master when it comes to creating a milieu which blends all movie elements together and hence drags you in making you forget about time and problems.<br/><br/>Aliens was made in 1986., so it's special effects (which won him Oscar, both for visual and audio effects which means they were amazing thirty years ago) can't measure up to nowadays standards; but that doesn't even matter! They did their job very well and provided finishing touch in Aliens space-ship world and aliens themselves. Anything more would've ruined what's far more important than SE since SE usually highlight only themselves and can drag you away from the rest of the movie. What more can you ask for when you've got the coolest guns (Private Vasquez anyone?) and the coolest aliens ever!? Not to mention the coolest female protagonist to this day to hit the screens, Ripley.<br/><br/>Aliens is more action oriented than its predecessor which centers more on being suspense. If somebody would've told me today that movie I like went more action packed I would immediately postulate that it then must loose something to its atmosphere. I would've been so wrong if I made that statement about Aliens. Here, action is so well distributed throughout the movie that it not even once occupies a substantial amount of time or takes away from suspense. Although there's a lot of action, Aliens is still not an action movie; like IMDb suggests it's a sci-fi horror adventure with shootings as a flavor.<br/><br/>Let me now briefly turn my attention to protagonists. Sigourney Weaver played Ripley in every Alien movie and was accompanied with beautiful Winona Ryder in Alien: Resurrection. Sigourney delivered very strong performance of a very tough Ripley in each and every movie in Alien series. That's how female protagonist should look like: reasonable, courageous and cooperative. Unfortunately, thirty years later all main female stars look like Rey from Star Wars VII: arrogant, non-cooperative, too powerful etc. Blame feminist movement for not having another Ripley! Everything I have to say about Ripley can be stated with: the greatest female movie hero ever. When it comes to other crew members I remember private Hudson played by always easily recognizable Bill Paxton whom I've recently seen starring in Frailty. He's on Terminator 1 and Titanic as well. After Ripley, however, pvt. Vasquez (Janette Goldstein) is my favorite crew member. Just look at her red rag and woodland cameo pants together with tank-top! And oh men, just look at the weapon she's carrying! Goldstein is a blast and plays minor roles in Terminator 2 and Titanic as well. Alien queen can be seen as a standalone character as well. Just wait till you see her. Newt (Carrie Henn), a child stuck on board, just makes you feel warm around your heart. I'm so glad Cameron decided to make a child as a crew member as well since she by her own presence forces all other crew members to show their easy and gentle side. Henn was ten at the time. Now she forty, married with children. Time flies...<br/><br/>Aliens has it all: a beautiful, real women protagonist with great crew members and chemistry among them. Even today very good SE, both visual and sound. Tense atmosphere with perfectly distributed action. Horror elements which blend with sci-fi environment. Story which keeps the movie rolling. The coolest aliens ever. Everything is very finely mixed thus summoning milieu which may just stay with you for a very long time."

","Sent along on a rescue mission to determine the source of lost contact with a space station, a woman and a group of Marines find themselves under attack by the same alien threat she encountered before.<br/><br/>This is an almost-flawless film, with tons of stuff to really love and very little to dislike. In fact, the only parts not to like here result from the film's near gargantuan running time, which is tempered by the continuous action but still has a lot of extras in it that are wholly unnecessary and don't really serve much purpose beyond character development, which is quite extended in the later half with the surrogate-mother storyline being the main culprit that really hampers the action. In fact, that alone is really the film's main shining quality, it's stupendous and utterly thrilling action scenes which are some of the best filmed in the genre, and among the top in many other genres altogether. From the initial swarming shot in the colony to the encounters in the medic bay and the numerous shoot-outs with them, its pace is nearly frenetic and nonstop, giving off so many impressive scenes that there's a real sense of thrills to come from them. That also includes the aliens themselves getting more screen-time, and the extra exposure does them good as they come across, in all their stages, as a really imposing and fantastic life-form, and the extra knowledge acquired about them doesn't hurt either. The gore is ratcheted up with some more bodies to get ripped apart, the locations much more suspenseful and the film as a whole doesn't have a lot wrong with it, leaving this as a fantastic sequel that is far better than the original.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children in danger"

It didn't establish a mood, all it did was make me wonder why they are wasting my time like this. I also thought the introduction of Newt was a pretty lame attempt to get me to care about the story. I'm glad she died in the third movie after seeing this. ""They mostly come out at night... mostly..."" What a joke.<br/><br/>Now, after about the hour and a half mark things actually start to get interesting, and from there on out it's a pretty cool movie. Even though the whole ending battle was forced and shouldn't have happened at all if Ripley didn't take pot-shots at the queens eggs (even thought they would have died anyway), It was still a pretty good ending.<br/><br/>BTW, I saw the 168 minute directors cut, which may be why I think it drags for so long at the beginning."

","Both Lt. Ellen Ripley and Dr. Elizabeth Shaw were written as protagonists and heroes by their writers, but they both actually tripped genocides.<br/><br/>Female heroes wronged by their writers...<br/><br/>Ripley was celebrated by movie fans for going toe-to-toe with company man Carter Burke, who wanted to sneak two Alien embryos past quarantine by smuggling them in Ripley's and another character's body while they were in hibernation. Burke was then going to kill the rest of the crew by sabotaging their hibernation units on the trip home. Ripley swore to him she was going to tell the company everything he tried to do, and make sure that they nailed him, ""right to the wall!""<br/><br/>The reality is, Carter Burke is actually the hero of the story who would have prevented a genocide. He is the one who sent the family (Newt's) out to investigate, and they are the ones that found the spaceship. The spaceship that was filled with hundreds, if not thousands of eggs, and if this hadn't happened this way (as seen in the movie, with the unfortunate number of a few hundred people), the station/colony would have continued to grow in size, with hundreds or thousands more of the human colonists...<br/><br/>And, eventually, one day, someone would have found that spaceship, and those eggs, and those hundreds (or thousands) of humans would all be killed by the Aliens. That would have been the genocide, but Carter's greedy actions prevented this eventuality. Carter is the hero. Ripley, our supposed hero, is shouting-down the actual hero, threatening to nail him, ""Right to the wall!"" for his illegal actions which hadn't even happened yet (so far, he is an innocent man).<br/><br/>Once the company that was trying to terraform the planet found out about the Aliens and how they had killed a few hundred of their colonists, and that there's an Alien ship there with thousands more eggs, the company would have quarantined the whole planet and moved on.<br/><br/>(Although, why the original explorers BEFORE the terraformers didn't find the spaceship is beyond me. It's apparently really close to base. But, I have to let it go...)<br/><br/><ul><li>- -</li></ul><br/><br/>As for, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw, she is quite the hero of the story in movie ""Prometheus"". Sole survivor, except for an android, like Ripley. Tough, like Ripley. And, she tripped a genocide, just as Ripley had.<br/><br/>In a case of profound misjudgment, she chose to actually believe that the homicidal android she needed to fly her off the planet, would get her safely to her next destination.<br/><br/>She did this out of selfishness, ""I want to know where they came from.""<br/><br/>She should have stayed, and died, on the planet.<br/><br/>Not only was she stunningly unable to correct her errors but she probably wasn't even aware that the smiling David android we see in the next movie, ""Alien: Covenant"", flushed the gorgeous green planet below with death and doom causing genocide to its humanoids or, as the name we've come know them as, the Engineers. But it wasn't just the Engineers, David killed every single animal on the entire planet; untold ecological billions died and left landmines to kill any living thing that might visit the beautiful planet in the future.<br/><br/>And, he killed Shaw.<br/><br/>For such a smart protagonist, the writers sure made her bafflingly stupid. At the end of the movie, David has commandeered another spaceship filled with thousands of hibernating colonists, A VERY SMART FEMALE CAPTAIN, a new identity, fresh Alien eggs, and he's still wildly homicidal. That's still Dr. Shaw's fault. She, literally, put his head back on his body, got into an Alien ship with him and took off, when she should have just stayed and died on that planet.<br/><br/>Or, had better writers.<br/><br/>THESE FEMALE HEROES WERE WRONGED BY THEIR WRITERS!<br/><br/>Am I the only one who sees this?"

","Don't get me wrong, this film is great, but one thing I didn't like is how scaled-down the aliens' strength is. It might just be because I played Alien Isolation, and watched the first movie, but one thing that was important in both was how strong each alien is. In Alien Isolation (which is canon), an entire space station gets run down by a drone that couldn't have been much more than a week old. In the first movie, the entire crew of the Nostromo is slaughtered by a drone that was only a few days old, and yet in this movie, the fully grown Xenomorphs get mowed down en masse just because the protagonists have bigger guns? No, I don't think it works like that, not to mention the Xenomorphs were fighting head-on when it's already been established that they are at their best when hunting stealthily. Now again, this isn't a bad film. The cinematography is fantastic, as are the special effects (The Queen is just gorgeous). The acting was great for the most part, as always I loved Sigourney's performance (Although the little girl's line delivery was questionable). While I don't like it as an Alien movie, as a movie on its own it's still an absolute masterpiece, and definitely deserves a watch."

","What a scary movie! ! James Cameron is really a great commercial director! To say he is a ""commercial"" director does not mean to disparage him, because commercial films can have as much meaning as so-called art-house films. Just in theory, it gives us more sensory stimulation and more grand endings.
Let's start with the business, maybe because Ridley Scott didn't have a lot of technology when he shot the first episode, maybe because Ridley Scott preferred to create a scary atmosphere rather than specific scary scenes. Anyway, James Cameron did make the second episode a lot scarier than the first. For example, when the female pilot turns around and suddenly finds the alien sitting behind him, for example, the alien victim who suddenly opens her eyes, for example, when the little girl says in a childish voice, ""can't go now, right? ""Like the giant"" alien ""that appears at the end of the movie... I'm scared to death.
Speaking of connotations, I was surprised to find that the movie has a strong feminist flavor. We saw that all the male soldiers who appeared in the movie did not survive, whether they were brave, cowardly, intelligent or stupid. Of course, two female fighters also died, which is a sign that they were too masculine, too strong, too lacking in feminine tenderness and motherhood. Our main character, Ripley, is both masculine and feminine, tender and maternal. (that little girl, Newt, is in part a reflection of Ripley's maternal nature.) After all, she's the only one who survived the alien attacks on the interstellar aliens, and she's the one who found Ripley and his gang an escape route.
Bishop, the robot who always fought bravely and ended up dying, is obviously very important to JamesCameron personally. If the robot in the first episode is the origin of all the tragedies, thus expressing that Ridley Scott, the director of the first episode, is trying to express a certain fear of modern technology, then James Cameron clearly believes that modern technology can bring people more happiness than tragedy. James Cameron has always believed this, and his film career has always been a big step along the way
He liked the ending: the survivors were returning to earth, and Ridley told Newt that he could now sleep well and not worry about nightmares. At this point, the once full of horror atmosphere is no longer exist, leaving us only a calm and peaceful atmosphere, and of course, a sense of security"

","James Cameron famously wrote the script for this film and Rambo at the same time. It doesn't sound so hard considering he basically wrote the same film twice. PTSD suffering hero is dropped back into the location that birthed all their trauma and manages to rescue a lone survivor - a failed rescue leaves them stranded and forced to fight their way out while various 80s yuppie scumbags get in their way. Both films are sequels to very different origin movies and both films up the guns and ammo quotient to great effect and much success. The main diffrerence being that Ripley is given something to live for while Rambo ends up isolated and alone."

","Sequel to the much beloved Ridley Scott film Alien, Aliens substitutes creepy atmosphere for pure balls out action, and boy does it succeed. This movie, along with The Terminator showcased the world the genius of James Cameron. Perhaps the best single word to describe James Cameron's Aliens is relentless. Tautly paced and expertly directed, this roller coaster ride of a motion picture offers a little bit of everything, all wrapped up in a tidy science fiction/action package. From the point when the opening half-hour of exposition ends, and the real movie begins, Cameron barely gives viewers a chance to catch their breaths or ease their grips on their armrests as he plunges his characters from one dire situation to the next. This is one of those rare motion pictures that involves the audience so completely in the story that we're as worn out at the end as our on-screen counterparts. For fans of the Alien series, Aliens represented an unqualified triumph, exceeding the expectations of the most optimistic faithful. When it comes to the logical marriage of action, adventure, and science fiction, few films are as effective or accomplished as Aliens."
"big_dick_boatmaster_69","8","0","1","21 July 2019"," Note: I have only seen the uncut version. The one preferred by Cameron
","The beginning of the movie is rather odd in its pacing, it seems to jump from scene to scene with no consideration for what happened before the current scene. The acting seems much worse than it actually is in the beginning because the characters aren't as grounded as they are on LV-426. The fact that the pilots aboard the drop-ship didn't lift the ramp-thingy, thus allowing an alien aboard, seems like a major plot-hole but I'm no colonial marine so I'm not exactly fit to comment on it. The romantic relationship between Hicks and Ripley was forced and it could've been removed and it wouldn't of been any worse; it's only in like 3 scenes anyways. Newt saying ""mommy"" towards the end was kind of weird and forced but plausible given the context. Ripley calling the queen a b*tch was also more funny and tonally inconsistent than anything else and broke some of my immersion.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie is a masterpiece."
"Sankari_Suomi","9","0","6","16 March 2019"," James H. Cameron's Aliens: Special Edition
","It is rare for a sequel to eclipse the original, but that's what happened when Aliens hit theatres in 1986. Six years later, Cameron released James H. Cameron's Aliens: Special Edition, which he introduced as follows:<br/><br/>'What you're about to watch is the special edition of Aliens. I actually prefer this version to the released version, because, as it's been best described by one of my friends, it's 40 miles of bad road. I think it's a longer, more intense and more suspenseful version of the film. The conventional wisdom then was: don't make the film too long. But at two hours and 37 minutes, this is the ride that we intended you to take. So, enjoy it.'<br/><br/>The Special Edition of Aliens holds the unique distinction of being the only alternate edition in the Alien franchise considered canonical by 20th Century Fox. It also contains all the smoking scenes, where we discover that everyone is still using regular 20th century tobacco products in the year 2179.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>* Ellen Ripley (cigarettes)
* Carter J. Burke (cigarettes)
* Members of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation review board (cigarettes)
* Gunnery Sergeant Al Apone (cigar)<br/><br/>There is also a suggestion that Ripley's cat (Smokey Black) chews tobacco leaves; this is audible during one of the early scenes after Ripley leaves the Holodeck.<br/><br/>While Cameron had very little creative control over Alien, the sequel was a very different matter. Here he was responsible not just for direction, but also the screenplay and story. Cameron's Xenomorph design remained true to the original Geiger-inspired vision from which later sequels would radically depart. For visual effects, he hired the brilliant Skotak brothers.<br/><br/>Aliens was produced at the height of the so-called 'homosexual panic' of the 1980s, when it was feared that gay people would flood North America with their deviant ways, and eventually reduce heterosexuals to a persecuted minority. Cameron took note of this, and shaped his subtext accordingly.<br/><br/>The Xenomorphs are predominantly male, and aggressively phallic. They represent an ideological and existential threat to the explicitly heterosexual colonists of Acheron LV-426. Their means of reproduction (oral rape) reflects a longstanding myth that homosexuality is contagious.<br/><br/>The Acheron Queen is a symbol of the feminised masculinity that was widely believed to comprise an essential aspect of the homosexual psyche. It does not represent lesbianism, as many commentators have suggested.<br/><br/>Ripley, Hicks, and Noot represent the traditional, all-American nuclear family, offering the best defence against homosexual invasion and conquest. By contrast, single males (e.g. Hudson) and masculinised females (e.g. Vasquez) are quickly overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Despite being a Hispanic character, Vasquez was played by Jenette Goldstein, a freckled, pale-skinned Jew with blonde hair and blue eyes. This required Goldstein to perform in 'Latintoface' (brown contact lenses, and full face/body makeup) which was acceptable in the 80s, but considered 'problematic' today.<br/><br/>It is noteworthy that most Hispanic and Latino people praise Goldstein's portrayal of Vasquez, while those who are outraged by it tend to be middle class whites of a certain ideological persuasion. At any rate, Goldstein received a Saturn award for Best Supporting Actress Pretending to be a Hispanic Person, and Vasquez is still one of the most popular characters of the entire Alien franchise. I personally rate her as equal with Ripley for sheer awesomeness.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie is superb: gritty, sparse, and intense. The one-liners and comebacks are some of the best you'll ever seen in the popular and well established sci-fi/action/family adventure/thriller/socio-political/post-capitalist/drama genre. The tension and action ebb and flow in exactly the right way. The colour pallette is flatter than you'd expect, but this works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>The visuals are highly evocative, and deliberately so. The M41A Pulse Rifle was inspired by elements of the M1A1 Thompson, Remington Model 870, and Franchi SPAS-12. The UD-4L Cheyenne Dropship was inspired by the the Apache AH-64 attack helicopter. The Kushan Assault Frigate of Homeworld and Homeworld Cataclysm was subsequently inspired by the U.S.S. Sulaco.<br/><br/>I rate James H. Cameron's Aliens: Special Edition at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a cracking 9/10 on IMDB."
"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","0","3","8 March 2019"," A different and action-packed take on the original Alien film.
","While I'm sure a Ridley Scott sequel to his smash-hit, Alien (1979), would be fantastic by any stretch of the imagination, the choice to go with similarly-successful James Cameron in the director's seat helped to keep the franchise from becoming too stale. Of course, with a sequel appearing seven years after the original, Alien had plenty of time to rest on its laurels before the follow-on film came along. Watching Aliens (1986) with the knowledge of James Cameron's other work, it soon becomes apparent that this movie is all his own. After all, if I told you there's a James Cameron film about space marines invading an alien world to eliminate an alien threat, many of you would think I'm referring to Avatar (2009) and not Aliens (1986).<br/><br/>In the original Alien, much of the focus of the film is on survival, let alone how to defeat such an unstoppable creature. For Aliens, the tables have turned, and man is now on the offensive, even if they don't take the threat as seriously as they should. Aliens has its moments of terror and horror, but they aren't nearly as jarring as they are in the original. Instead, the strength of Aliens lies in its action as much as it is in its memorable one-liners. From Bill Paxton's freak out, ""Game over, man! Game over!"" to Sigourney Weaver's defiant challenge in the final battle, Aliens is more in line with a summer blockbuster than its predecessor ever was.<br/><br/>Even though both of these films in the Alien franchise are exemplary in their own right, one can't help but notice that they're almost the same script, even down to the final vanquishing of the titular alien. Sure, both have a different approach to it (of which I almost prefer the robot-suit ending of the sequel), but it ends up being a tad disappointing to basically watch the same events occur again without much deviation from the formula that worked once before.<br/><br/>A different and action-packed take on the original Alien film, I give Aliens 4.0 stars out of 5."

","All hail James Cameron.<br/><br/>Much like Alien, my experience with its 1986 sequel, Aliens is limited to non-existent as I never watched it growing up mostly because I was far too young to even see it even if I had wanted to. However, as I got older and began to hear other people comment on how excellent the film was, I felt compelled to give Aliens a watch and lo and behold, I absolutely loved it. From its solid direction and writing to it's wonderfully executed action and top-notch performances, Aliens is a movie that stands head and toes above its predecessor in every possible way.<br/><br/>The film opens with Eileen Ripley drifting in space while in stasis for 57 years but is rescued by a deep-space salvage team and taken to a space station above Earth. While recovering, she learns that her daughter has passed away. Later on, she is questioned by her employers of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as to why she destroyed The Nostromo. Ripley tries to explain what happened but the company don't believe her and revoke her pilot license. Meanwhile, on the planet LV-426, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation has established a terraforming colony but when contact with the settlement is lost, a representative named Carter Bruke asks Ripley for help. Ellen is reluctant is take part in the operation due to her previous encounter with the beasts but after Burke reassures her that the mission is to wipe the creatures out, she agrees. On board the USS Sulaco, Ripley meets the Colonial Marines along with the android Bishop who Ripley is at first hostile to due to her previous experience with Ash. The team soon descends down to the planet's surface and enter the compound where they find signs of a struggle but no bodies apart from a devastated young girl named Newt. The group then processes to the center of the compound where they find the settlers cocooned. After the marines kill a chestburster, the rest of the aliens emerge and attack the squad, killing several. When the inept Lieutenant Gorman panics, Ripley drives the transport into the hive to save the remaining marines. Now, the survivors must find a way to get off the planet before it's too late.<br/><br/>In the world of moviemaking, creating the perfect sequel that is able to match the first one is never an easy task to pull off and every guideline that dictates such actions always has a number of exemptions to this rule. Empire Strikes Back had a different director working on the movie and it turned out fantastic, Evil Dead II was just the first movie with a bigger budget and more comedy while Terminator 2 was a much larger film with bigger action and a more human story then what the first Terminator was. Aliens go against all of those rules mostly with the rule of not amping up the action in an effort to have a majority draw. Having shown in The Terminator that he could handle both captivating sci-fi themes as well as nerve-racking tension, James Cameron was the right guy to carry the story set by Ridley Scott's 1979 classic upon his shoulders onwards and adjust it for the 1980s action crowd and while the movie is not as frightening nor as satisfying as Alien, it nevertheless endures as an appealing and smart action film that doesn't insult or talk down to its audience unlike action movies like Transformers: Age of Extinction or Robocop 3.<br/><br/>Out of all of Cameron's films, there are several that are always battling each other for the top stop and while I will say that Terminator 2 is easily Cameron's best movie in terms of story and themes, Aliens is easily more accessible and easier to watch than other sci-fi movies like Avatar or Passengers. Disregarding the movie's place within a quintessential film series, Aliens serves as a practical handbook on how to adequately build a movie, from the screenplay to directing the action and everything else in between. It's difficult to see Aliens as anything less than a total cinematic achievement, no matter what standpoint you see the movie from. Cameron's choice to take the Alien series from horror to action seems a bit bewildering to those who haven't watched the first film. Nowadays, action movies like Skyscraper, A Good Day To Die Hard and the Fast and the Furious movies have become identified with idiotic and cheesy dialog, cardboard characters, redundant storytelling and horribly shot action scenes that it's now easy for audiences to forget the brilliance and improvements directors like Cameron, Spielberg, and McTiernan brought to the genre. As Dan O'Bannon said, taking the story Alien established and turning it into an action film was the best route to take the series. Had that not happened, the series would have become the next Halloween, creating more of the same unoriginal and unfrightening horror films lacking any of the passion or creativity that made the first film work so well.<br/><br/>It's often be argued whether Alien or Aliens is the better film. In my personal opinion, I gravitate more towards Aliens due to its more accessible story and more fleshed-out characters but it's never an easy decision as both are perfect examples of two very different kinds of filmmaking as well as both films being notable enough to stand on their own as fairly stand-alone movies. While Alien and Aliens may share a lot of the same story points, visuals, and the same lead character, they are both entirely different movies from one another as Ridley Scott's Alien is a haunted house in space while James Cameron's Aliens is a futuristic war movie with elements of horror added in. While there are obvious spheres of overlapping from both films, there are also key contrasts too as both Scott and Cameron use horror differently. Ridley's version of Ellen Ripley is able to survive due to her rejecting the conformity of the womanlike trope of being the scream queen or the victim while Cameron's version of Ripley is able to destroy the alien queen by grasping her stand-in family with Newt being her daughter, Hicks being her husband and Bishop being the loving uncle.<br/><br/>However, regardless of how fantastic the story is, it's also how Aliens is built up in terms of its pacing that make it so great. It would be fairly bad if one assumed that the attention given to the events unfolding as well as the mainstream appeal would mean that the world of Aliens and Ellen Ripley would be lacking any kind of development, but much like what Nolan did on Batman Begins or what Joss Whedon did on The Avengers, it takes almost an hour until the main action even gets going and yet, the viewer is never left feeling bored. Like Alien before it, Aliens takes its time setting up its surroundings as well as its characters. It doesn't rely on hitting the viewer over the head with explaining Ripley's backstory to us as the movie does a wonderful job showing us all the events that have taken place since the first film. Unlike a director like Roland Emmerich, James Cameron actually takes the time to build up and develop the cast of characters. Sure, the Marines may come across to some as generic but at the very least they feel like actual characters with a part to play in the movie rather just be irritating comic relief or just there to be used as cannon fodder for the plot's convenience unlike a movie such as The Patriot. The amount of detail and thought that went into creating the characters as well as building the world of the film is nothing short of astonishing and pays off handsomely by the time the final action set-piece rears its head. That is a testament to the airtight screenplay that Cameron wrote himself as well as throughout the film, Cameron arranges the scenarios that the characters find themselves in and the outcomes of those situations so beautifully, bringing in ideas like the damaged nuclear reactor and the motion trackers in intelligent ways long before they can give the viewer any sort of exciting finale.<br/><br/>All this may feel like a standard storytelling approach that could apply to any movie, but I personally believe very few directors can pull this off as well as James Cameron can. Hell, it's one of the main reason why even casual moviegoers are able to be engrossed by Cameron's films so easily even more so than a Spielberg or a J.J. Abrams movie. It's his gift for incredible storytelling and quality filmmaking that have made films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day and True Lies connect with audiences and critics as well as earn high amounts of money. It's also because much like the Indiana Jones and Star Wars films, all of Cameron's films are completely approachable to a vast majority of people and demographics which again shows how gifted James Cameron is in all of those departments even if some of his films don't always have the amount of quality and passion behind them. In my personal opinion, Aliens is everything Avatar tried to be but failed at being. One of the best things about the film series is that each of the movies has it's own definite visual style while having a different director working on each movie. While Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection aren't held in high standards when it comes to the franchise, one can't disagree that all four movies have a quintessential visual style that compliments the director behind the camera even if the final film isn't up to par with what the first two movies are. Much like the beasts themselves, the films are flexible and sensible as well as being able to superbly imitating Fincher's or Scott's styles behind and in front of the camera.<br/><br/>In the case of themes and messages, Aliens delivers a surprisingly complex moral on commercial greed and corruption, something Cameron would explore again in Avatar even though I personally feel that Aliens has a better handle on its messages more so than Cameron's later film does and doesn't rely on the standard ""white guy falls in love with a women from another culture and becomes part of that culture all while his fellow men wage war on the tribe."" troupe that both Avatar and Dances with Wolves"

This one here copies everything and does not add anything new. Army troops are overly standardized and unrealistic. The characters seem to be drawn from classic post WWII movies with no knowledges to be involved in a high tech environment . Although we have some good characters like our synthetic man Bishop, but Burke is weak in all respect and without much logic.

It's entertaining and suspensful as hell.<br/><br/>And ... that's about all I can say about it. »Aliens« doesn't give me much to think about, although it has so much more plot than the original. This movie is the definition of a blockbuster: well made and engaging, but ultimatively empty and calculated. What escpecially bugs me is the new character Newt. This sweet little girls serves one purpose and one purpose only: Making Ellen Ripley into a mother. Throughout the whole movie Cameron tries to give Ripley a new family. That's interesting enough (altough it may rise some feministic concerns), but it's handled in a painfully heavy-handed way.<br/><br/>Gone is the artful agitation of »Alien«, gone its originality and openness. It's clear that a lot of effort went into »Aliens«, but its emotional core is lacking. It's a worthwhile watch anyway, I'd be a fool to deny the raw power this movie has.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","19 May 2016"," A classic sequel that's almost as good as the original
","Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is, without a doubt, one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time. With that in mind, writer/director James Cameron wisely chose to approach the subject matter from a different angle for the sequel. Placing the emphasis more on hi-octane action than on claustrophobic horror, Cameron crafted one of the best sequels ever and a classic in its own right.<br/><br/>The story picks up more than five decades after the original film. The planet has now been colonized but contact with the colonists has mysteriously been lost. Ripley, having been recently awakened from suspended animation, is tasked with serving as an adviser to a squad of space marines sent to investigate the situation. What they find proves to be more than equal to their high-tech firepower.<br/><br/>Being set decades in the future, the cast is all new except for Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. In my opinion, she's even more impressive here than in the first movie. Academy voters must have agreed since she ended up with an Oscar nomination for her performance. The rest of the cast, while memorable, arguably isn't as strong as the first movie's matchless ensemble. That being said, for an action movie, the acting is undoubtedly more than satisfactory in bringing to life these varied characters.<br/><br/>Visually, I think that Ripley Scott has the edge but Cameron certainly holds his own. This movie made more extensive use of special effects and I find most of them quite convincing. In fact, the visual effects were the source of one of the film's two Oscar wins (the other was for sound editing). Meanwhile, James Horner's score recalls Jerry Goldsmith's memorable score for ""Alien"" at times while being more action-oriented when necessary.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what makes the movie stand out beyond the production values & acting is the compelling story. Ellen Ripley becomes a fully realized character in a script that deftly mixes strong characterization, thrilling action, imaginative settings/creatures & captivating human drama. Certainly worthy of following in the footsteps of ""Alien"", it too ranks as one of the best science fiction movies ever made.<br/><br/>(Note: Both the original theatrical cut and the director's cut are equally worth watching.)"
"nmholland","10","0","1","27 April 2016"," One More Sequel Equivalant to That of the First
","Aliens is directed by James Cameron and is a continuation of 1979's Alien. In this movie, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the soul survivor from the alien attack from the first film, was found floating in space after 57 years in hypersleep. When she awakes, she learns that her daughter and everyone else she knew is dead, and that a colony has since formed on LV-426, the alien planet. Once the station she's on loses signal from the colony, Ripley, along with a crew of marines, must go to LV-426, and see if there are any survivors.<br/><br/>Rarely is a sequel as good as the first film in a franchise. This has only been present in a few film franchises, such as the Terminator franchise, the Mad Max franchise, and the Star Wars franchise. Other than those, no other films come to mind. Except for Aliens. When James Cameron decided to direct a sequel to Alien (1979), he decided to go a different route. Rather than making a horror film, he made an action movie. That was a great move on Cameron's part, and it helped him make a great film, one equal to that of the original.<br/><br/>The hands down best thing about Aliens is the perfect mix between action and suspense. Cameron directed an action movie, not a horror, yet Aliens is surprisingly suspenseful. The suspense is especially a large factor in a specific scene, no spoilers, in which Ripley is locked in a room with a couple of facehuggers; that was white knuckled terror. Even in the action scenes when the marines are fighting the xenomorphs, suspense is present.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the action in Aliens is abundant. In almost every scene, there's action going on somewhere. Although the first act, which involved Ripley getting back to LV-426, doesn't have too much action, the viewer is preparing themselves for it, thanks to the ingenious buildup by the script and actors. Once Ripley reaches the planet, and war breaks out between the aliens and the marines, it's non stop. Although there are breather scenes, or scenes for the viewer to catch their breath, the action almost never lets up, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.<br/><br/>Another great thing surrounding Aliens is the acting. Of course, Sigourney Weaver owns the role of Ellen Ripley, but she doesn't exactly steal the show. While Ripley is the main character, and the most interesting, all of the other characters are written and portrayed well. Michael Biehn as Hicks was amazing, Bill Paxton was great as Hudson, and Lance Henriksen was fantastic as Bishop. However, Carrie Henn as Newt was absolutely astounding. Without spoiling anything about her character, this was easily one of the best child performances of all time, especially in an action movie.<br/><br/>The last element that Aliens deserves praise for is the basis for the storyline. After the end to the first Alien (1979), continuing the story seemed difficult, but it was pulled off wonderfully in Aliens. Not only did the script have to get Ripley back on screen, but it had to get her back to LV-426 willingly. The way that the script purposes to get Ripley back to the alien planet is perfectly convincing, but isn't brushed over either. The proposal isn't cheap, or quick, it's flawless.<br/><br/>In the end, Aliens is equal to that of Alien (1979), critically. Personally, I prefer Alien (1979) slightly more, but they are both amazing. Anyone who likes action, space operas, or the first film in the franchise will love Aliens."

"sharky_55","9","0","1","18 April 2016"," It won't make a difference.
","Aliens is in many a carbon copy of the action thriller that was Alien - in which the lone feminist Ripley goes beyond her means to beat down the enemies and go through a personal growth. There is the same time limit which blares through the action to remind us of the impending doom. The same company interfering moral boundaries for their own financial gain. And there is the second chance for the Alien to strike back - they are never truly safe on these spaceships. Interestingly enough although Cameron builds much on the world that Scott created with a larger wealth of secondary characters and regulations and jurisdictions, but is wise enough to remain in the gritty, mysterious final frontier. No doubt Earth by now is either a desolate wasteland or glittering utopia - but the story does not need the contrast. There is a peculiar shot that sums it all up - the despondent Ripley waiting for any news about the current timeline, sitting on a bench within some trees, and then the camera swings around and reveals the background as a phony, two dimensional projection. <br/><br/>But apart from a similar plot structure Cameron has improved on the predecessor in many ways. Technically, the difference is obvious. The practical puppetry involved with the gigantic alien queen and the exosuit cargo loaders is brilliant; they move seamlessly and with a life of their own. The corrupted industrial setting is perfect for the battle for territory - Biddle's job is made easy with the pitch darkness only split by the glaring flood lights of the marines. A really great decision to use that singular natural light source to ramp up the anxiety of each shadowy corner and archway; elsewhere there are little touches like a giant fan to chop up the flickering lights. The smoke and dust is atmospheric whilst also masking the budgetary and limitations; we never know what's around the corner (or up above). And who can forget that dripping, slimy translucent tunnel feeding the queen? A secondary effect of the technical improvement is to clearly show how outclassed the humans still are after 57 years. The marines are predictable enough, and verging on cliché. The Vietnam parallels are clear; go in with a lot of firepower and not much sense, and be overwhelmed and out of their element. Paxton is the only one who really oversells it - overconfident initially and then a hammy, hokey coward. But can you blame him? The crew in Aliens had at least spacesuits (which were nevertheless violated). These soldiers have thin vests and some not even gloves. <br/><br/>Here we have a clear, well defined arc for Ripley. There is noticeably more maternal subtext than previously; the appearance of Newt drives her development from traumatised to level-headed and intelligent, and the protective motherly instinct mirrored by the nest queen itself seeing its eggs set on fire. A scene from the director's cut actually gives it even more meaning, where we find out the fate of Ripley's young daughter, having passed away in her middle age only 2 years before. So through her redemption she gains a second chance with Newt. The story comes full circle."
"luke-a-mcgowan","9","0","1","12 April 2016"," An outstanding action film with hints of the first Alien aplenty
","1. You can definitely feel the different direction taken by James Cameron as opposed to Ridley Scott. Whilst it fits snugly beside Ridley Scott's masterpiece in lore and continuity, Aliens is a different creature altogether, with a heavier emphasis on action and a much leveller playing field between the humans and the aliens. <br/><br/>2. That is not to say that the humans aren't in constant peril. In 1997, James Cameron would create Titanic and make us feel like we were on that sinking ship with a feeling of perpetual dread and helplessness. He does the same thing here, with a small group of humans trapped on a hostile planet without a dropship to get off. Cameron knows just when to use the acid blood to spray back on the humans and remind us of the high stakes, or to cut power or drop something horrifying in our midst. Credit should also go to the highly intense music of James Horner and the cinematography of Adrian Bibble (The Mummy). <br/><br/>3. Sigourney Weaver does just as good a work here as in Alien. We get a much better sense of her character, such as her maternal instincts and natural leadership. Her chemistry with Newt (Carrie Henn) is what sells the movie, especially after her grief-stricken reaction to having missed her own daughter's death in her absence.<br/><br/>4. The character of Gorman, played by William Hope, is a bit of a pimple. He's important to show Ripley's natural leadership and to rack up the intensity of the civilian cocoon scene, but after that the screenwriters seemingly run out of things to do with him. He gets a knock on the head, then completely concedes to Ripley and Hicks taking his leadership. Then he dies in a way completely out of character for him. That bump on the head must have awoken another personality.<br/><br/>5. I always appreciated Michael Biehn's performance in Terminator, but here he shows what range he has because Hicks is more rugged and down-to-earth than the slightly wild Kyle Reese. I also really enjoyed the performances of Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and the brief appearance by Al Matthews. Carrie Henn surpasses the ""screaming child"" phase that so tanked Dakota Fanning in the 2000s. Lance Henrikson is great as Bishop, with his gentle and lined face and the way he politely gives a proffered gun back. <br/><br/>6. The moment those doors slide open and we see the acid-ravaged colony's interior I became unsettled. The outstanding production design and dark lighting really make the mood grim and carry over those hints of horror that Ridley Scott built into Alien.<br/><br/>7. Did anyone really not see Burke's betrayal coming? They tried to distract us by having Ripley suspicious of Bishop, and by having Burke help her out throughout the movie, but come on. Everyone knows the slippery corporate type is the bad guy.<br/><br/>8. The editing is great for the most part, making a two and a half hour film breeze by. However, there is one glaringly clunky edit where Hicks and the others appear to rescue Ripley and Newt from the facehuggers and we don't even see them enter the room, they're just all of a sudden pressed up against the glass. It is hard to explain but you'll notice it. I also didn't find the aliens aren't as scary this time, partly because we don't see them (i.e. miniguns shooting at darkness) or we see them coming too far in advance (when they are in the ceiling). Finally, I found that whole ""Ripley is crazy we don't believe you"" subplot for the first half an hour necessary but ultimately redundant. It was very awkward getting to the planet and having everyone (especially Burke) believe her after those scenes of disbelief on the trip there.<br/><br/>9. Ripley's rescue of Newt is fantastic. Courtesy of Weaver's slightly desperate anguish, we can see that Ripley knows she could very well die or find Newt dead, but we also see, thanks to the way they've bonded throughout the movie, that Ripley has no other choice. The decision to make the final fifteen minutes actually fifteen minutes was inspired, and the tension as she descends single-handedly into the Alien hive is fantastic.<br/><br/>10. The Alien Queen does in fact make for a phenomenal adversary to Ripley, even with quite limited screen time. The look on Ripley's face as she burns the Alien Queen's eggs says so much - she gets closure on her guilt of missing her daughter's death by extracting revenge on the creatures that caused it. The absolutely sensational line ""get away from her you BITCH"" is the single most badass thing a female character has ever said, and seeing Ripley throw down that Alien Queen is impressive. That being said, however, the fight on the ship was not wholly necessary. I had closure from their escape from the planet and the look Ripley gave the Queen who thought she had caught up to them. I didn't need it to copy Alien and have the fight through the airlock all over again, even if it did mean we got that awesome lifter moment. <br/><br/>Count the things that inspire Halo, I dare you. If you've read the extended universe novels, you'll find even more."

","Well, actually it was the first Alien movie that set the bar very high. But this is a sequel you can be proud of too. After 57 years (movie timeline that is) Siguorney (Ripley) is back at it, this time having been 'rescued' from the Nostromos lifeboat only to find that her report falls on deaf ""company"" ears.After being doubted to the point of ridicule, she finds a job on starship loading docks, her starship 'license' having been revoked as senior officer. After a few weeks she is contacted by a company rep that wants her to accompany a rescue mission with some tough (hombres') space marines. She finally agrees, and off we go on an exciting journey that is both exciting and scary at points throughout the movie...it was fun to watch and we get reintroduced to Michael Biehns well done acting...a very good movie!"

","It was hard to beat ""Alien"". It was an outstanding movie and I didn't expect this to be as good or better than it. It wasn't better, but it was still amazing. The movie has a huge buildup. It introduces the characters and the setting. When the team makes it into the shuttle, it is highly tense knowing that any one of them could be killed any second. The movie does a great job setting it up by making a dark and atmospheric environment. When they arrive at the planet, they encounter a little girl who's the only survivor and they rescue her. When the aliens show up, they kill several of the crew members and leave them stranded there. The second half of the film is an intense ride of action and death. Several of the characters in the movie have interesting personalities. The fight scenes are very tense and well done. Many other military movies use this movie as a guide to learn off of. I didn't feel the same amount of tension as I did with the first one, but it was still very good. The sequels that follow just try to cash in on the name and rarely bring anything new to the series. However, this sequel is, in my opinion, one of the best movie sequels out there."

","Aliens (1986): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, Michael Biehn, Carrie Henn: Every bit as effective as Alien only this time the genre is action. It voices the reality of a problem gotten bigger. Sigourney Weaver returns as the survivor of the first film and awakens in the presence of military. They plan to destroy the aliens but the sleazy Burke has other plans. Upon reaching their destination Weaver discovers a little girl whose family was killed by the creatures. When the aliens surface, a fight for survival begins. Well plotted sequel with blazing action that never distracts from the narrative. It is James Cameron's remarkable twist in genres creating a great followup to The Terminator. Weaver delivers a knockout performance as Ripley who awakens to a whole new nightmare but the young girl gives her reason to live. Paul Reiser plays the scheming Burke who will receive his just desserts when his plan backfires. Lance Henriksen plays android Bishop whom Ripley first is hostile too after Ash from the first film but he gradually builds trust and ultimately sacrifice. Michael Biehn as a soldier takes charge and benefits. Carrie Henn plays the little girl whom Weaver rescues and determined to keep safe. While the original was horror, this one caters to action with nightmarish creatures underlining the threat that closed lids will not erase from the mind. Score: 9 / 10"
"robsta23","8","0","4","1 April 2015"," More Exciting than the First
","I appreciated Alien for its good mix of the sci-fi and horror genres. While Alien made me sick to my stomach, Aliens entertained me more than it scared or shocked me. More goofy characters and more aliens makes for more fun in my book.<br/><br/>I really like how we don't have a firm grasp on what is reality or a dream in the first few scenes of the film since Ellen jolts awake a few times. Some of the content in the dream, however, is grounded in reality however since it is said she has slept for 57 years both in the dream and reality.<br/><br/>Once again, however, the entire film could have been avoided if people just listened to Ripley. There would have been no alien on the ship in the first if the crew would have agreed with Ripley's logic following protocol, and here her warning is not heeded since people now live on the planet where she encountered the alien.<br/><br/>What is interesting is that while the film has similar elements to the first, they are still different in little ways. For example, this film has a villain who prioritizes capturing an alien to study, but he is human in this one as opposed to the cyborg Ash in the first.<br/><br/>While the first film is meant to humanize Ripley, this one humanizes here even more with her effort to protect the young girl Newt. It gets to us when Newt calls Ripley ""momma"" at the conclusion, showing this girl acts as a surrogate child after Ripley's actual daughter died when she was in hyper sleep.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, not too many complaints. The suspense and action is great, Bill Paxton is great as a cowardly hot-head in one of his early roles, and the magnitude of the film is so much higher than the first - they practically fight an army of aliens instead of just one, and I love a good action film that ups the stakes."
"RossRivero99","10","0","1","17 February 2015"," Cameron's best science fiction masterpiece since Avatar
","James Cameron's Aliens (1986) is nonetheless one of the best science fiction movies ever made along with Avatar (2009) , Inception (2010), Gravity (2013), 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968), E.T. (1982), Alien (1979), Minority Report (2002) and so much more, the movie picks up it's story from the last scene where the 1979 movie left off but instead it's 57 years later and Lt. Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver in an Oscar nominated performance) doesn't even know where she is and while being found she knows that the Aliens that she encountered before are about to strike again and everyone thinks she's crazy and then a few minutes later two men come into Ripley's apartment and ask her if she wants to assist a group of Marines on a mission to destroy the Aliens once and for all and things don't come out to be as intended to happen. Director James Cameron was a worthy successor as the second director of the Alien franchise and he proved it to me while I was watching this movie, if I were to choose which one of the two Alien movies to better than the other it would be a difficult decision for me to make because Scott's 1979 film has more suspenseful plot elements and has better storytelling, and this 1986 version is a lot more entertaining, ambitious, and still has great storytelling. The movie also has a great supporting cast to it including Michael Biehn, a young Bill Paxton in a very convincing performance as a soldier who is the most terrified of the aliens out of all his fellow Marines, and so many more. This movie is not only a great film it is also one of the best movies of 1986 period."

","In a college level FILM 249 course Fall 2014, we studied the film Aliens. What I suggest a viewer watch for during the film is the power of women. The propose or reasoning behind the director's inclusion of the power of women in this film may be to showcase through the main character Ellen Ripley and Rebecca ""Newt"" Jordan. Through Ripley the director is showing the strength that women have mentally and physically by how she is able to operate the machinery and how she is able to help the soldiers despite her fear of becoming a host for the aliens. It can also be shown through Newt too by how out of all of the people she is the only one to survive, how she leads them through the complex and how she keeps fighting through the end. Although Cpl.

","I watched this shortly after watching Alien. I was surprised by how different it was. Whereas Alien is a dramatic, suspenseful horror, Aliens is an all-out gung-ho action thriller.<br/><br/>Overall I preferred Alien, but Aliens does have a lot going for it. Sigourney Weaver is just as good as she was in the first movie - a believable gutsy action heroine with a soul. There is the sense of a relentless war of attrition, as the squad of marines steadily gets whittled down. And the non-stop action is thrilling - in fact it gets better and better as the movie goes on, culminating in an incredible battle between Weaver and the alien queen that is extremely well directed.<br/><br/>Saying all that, there are enough all-out action movies in the world and while this is one of the better ones, it is not as unique and original as Alien was. I also didn't think the aliens themselves were as frightening in this. They seem to get blasted away in large numbers with relative ease (bar the queen), like it's an exercise in pest control rather a battle with superhuman monsters.<br/><br/>But anyhow, this is an enjoyable and thrilling action movie that overall I would recommend."

","""Game over, man! Game over!""<br/><br/>I think that Aliens is a great sequel. It adds more action, sure, but it certainly keeps the horror elements. I do, however, think this movie sometimes falls into the same clichés that the first film suffers from.<br/><br/>The movie starts off really strong. The way they continue from where we left off in Alien really works. We also get a bigger sense of the universe that these films exist in that we didn't quite get in the first. It also really builds up exactly what were going to be in for. However, there are times during the movie where it kind of feels like a cheesy action movie, which certainly hurts the film. As I mentioned before, it also follows a few of the same clichés that the first movie does. An example of that would be the whole ""we blew up the monster and we're safe!"" kind of cliché. It can sometimes feel like what Alien would have been if it had instead been more of an action film than an atmospheric horror film. <br/><br/>Sigourney Weaver once again is great in this. She gives it her best once again which is great to see. When it comes to the other performances, they can be mixed. Michael Biehn gives a sometimes good, sometimes cheesy kind of performance. And Bill Paxton gives a love it or hate it performance. I think he is fun, but I can see why he could be hated. A lot of these Marines are nothing more than cheesy action movie clichés, such as the character Vasquez, who if this film was made today would be played by Michelle Rodriguez.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this film really works as a sequel, but still suffers from some of the issues that the first movie suffers from, which brings it down. If you've seen Alien, i'd recommend watching this too."
"NeonGoth","8","0","2","28 July 2014"," A Landmark Sci-fi Thriller
","Aliens, a film directed by James Cameron, is one of those cases where the sequel is better than its previous film. Everything about Ridley Scott's Alien is improved in this film. Even the title of this one sounds better... ""Aliens"". I like this movie.<br/><br/>First, let's start with the genre. Unlike Alien, this film does not belong in the horror section. While it does have more suspenseful and thrilling scenes, they are presented with an action-packed tone. One of the things I didn't like about the first film was the mostly slow and sometimes dull build-up. In this film, Cameron shows off his skills as an action director. With a faster pace, I felt more engaged to the story.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with the last film was that Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) was the only character I cared about. Nearly the rest of the cast were simply forgettable. Here, I felt closer to the rest of the cast. There was far more development and much more fun dialogue. I can honestly say my favorites were Vasquez, Hudson, Burke, Bishop, and especially the little girl, Newt. And, of course, as we learn more about Ripley, she was simply becoming a better character. I think it's fair to say the whole cast was pretty bad-a**.<br/><br/>And we can't have a classic sci-fi/action flick without some awesome special effects. What can I say that hasn't already been said? They were incredible then, and they are still incredible now.<br/><br/>Despite this being the better film, I feel I should bring up a few complaints. The pacing, in my opinion, does seem to slow a bit. I think it could be because sometimes, it seemed to follow the same formula as the previous film. Some scenes just seemed to drag on a little too long. It's probably just me. <br/><br/>In any case, I still like it. The film improves the previous one with visuals, narrative and characters. Ignoring a couple of complaints, this classic still makes a fun space thriller."

","The second installment of the ""Alien"" franchise comes in the form of ""Aliens"" by director James Cameron. Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Ellen Ripley and does a fantastic job as a realistic heroin. The film is way before its time in the sense of how mature it is written. It has everything, fantastic cinematography, intense characters and of course, action. Cameron manages to make the Alien just as menacing as before, even tho it is seen much more frequently. the introduction of a child character, Newt (Carrie Henn) who is the only survivor on the terraforming installation adds a sinister vibe to the film, that causes a sense of fear of the unknowing to the viewer. It is a classic Sci-Fi thriller that all Xenomorph lovers will enjoy."

","The film starts with a title sequence similar to the first as the letters slowly spell out ""Aliens"". Ripley has been rescued, along with Jones, but it's been almost 6 decades and her only surviving daughter is dead. What's worse, the company professes to not believing her, and she is stripped of her license. She's forced to take a crap job. Some time later, the planet that contains the aliens has been colonized, but one of the colonists awakens the hive, and contact is severed. Ripley is recruited to join a group of marines on a rescue mission. They arrive but find only 1 of the 158 inhabitants alive and are soon assaulted by the aliens. Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), a member of the company, is all the while trying to bring back one of the aliens. One by one the rescue party is killed. Eventually only Ripley, the surviving girl ""Newt"", and a badly hurt Bishop are able to make it to safety. The aliens appear to have been defeated, for now.<br/><br/>This movie has all the heavy hitting action that one would expect from a James Cameron flick. It stays true to the original in terms of plot, but it really is still a different movie. The first one was quiet where this is loud. There is a lot of gunshots and fighting and death. I liked seeing the devastation of the colony and, especially, the filth that Newt had to survive in. I liked that it created a separate world, albeit short lived, on the colony. We see the workers running around doing this and that.<br/><br/>Paul Reiser did a really good job as the sleazy representative (or whatever his job title was). He keeps this slight smirk on his face that makes you not trust him, although you aren't really given a reason until towards the end. <br/><br/>It's also great that a movie can have such good special effects 20 years after its debut (and before CGI). This movie is an achievement, although it works more like an action movie than a thriller. And I will say that I prefer the latter.<br/><br/>It's a big recommend."

","'Aliens' came out in 1986, so the quality of it won't be as good as a movie coming out today. I'm not giving this movie any special treatment for that. I'm reviewing and rating it just like I would rate and review a movie that would come out now. Anyway, there are two types of people in the world: people who think 'Alien' is better than 'Aliens', and people who think 'Aliens' is better than 'Alien'. I don't think either of them is better than another. I watched the 1990 special addition of the movie, so it's two and a half hours long.<br/><br/>'Aliens' had a very slow first hour of the movie. It worked for only about twenty minutes. The movie then started dragging on for the other forty minutes. In the first twenty minutes, it was alright because the slowness hadn't gotten boring yet, it was just used to introduce new characters and go over the situation at hand. This part of the first hour was enjoyable. As it went on, though, we had already known all of the characters and there was just nothing going on. There was quite a bit of CGI used near the end of the first hour, which I think they could gone without using, because it was two-dimensional CGI. There were also green screens used, which also brought it down. That was part of the reason the forty minute boring part was bad. The other part of the reason is that it was simply unexciting.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie had a few problems, too. A few of the actors didn't seem to give it their all. Luckily, the main actors and actresses (Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, and Michael Biehn) did well. I believed those three actors and actresses were their characters. The supposed cast weren't all very good, though.<br/><br/>In several scenes of this movie, the characters would have to be quiet to get through places, and there was no music in these parts. This made suspense build up to set up for action sequences. They executed this well in the film. It made trauma for the audience and even some intensity. That worked in the movie. They also didn't just have mindless acting in the movie. Every sequence had a reason for it's happening, which just made it more enjoyable. That brings up the quality of the acting sequences. The acting sequences were great. They had alright music for the situations and had very thrilling humans vs. aliens battle scenes. There were used of guns which brought more explosions that just made it more thrilling. Also, the humans didn't just win every time. There was an equal balance of aliens winning, too. This made the movie more thrilling and intense. It wouldn't have been good if the humans won every time. The technology used in that time period wasn't too far- fetched, either.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was really good. That's what my 8/10 rating means. I very much recommend 'Alien' and 'Aliens' to anyone who is thinking about watching it. I own the movie on Blu-Ray."

","There are several films where the second part is the best. Termonator 2 is one great example, Aliens is the second. Here, every little thing is a real work of art. This is such a great, timeless suspense movie that every time you watch it, you see some new details, some new events, some new revelations. This is a real treat and fest to eyes. Sigourney Weeaver, Lance Henriksen, Michael Biehn and others did such a marvelous job here. Ripley was never better, more convincing, decent and reckless than here. And then, there are those horrible, ghoulish shrieking aliens, so terrible and so menacing that they make you blood chill and freeze all 2 hours. This film was made in 1986 but still is watched like a very modern, up-to-date, fast, wild and unmitigated audacious attempt. Really good, really great.

"worth-palmer44","8","0","3","21 July 2013"," A Great Sequel Indeed!
","Suspenseful and terrifying like the original, but in completely different ways. Where Ridley Scott's first film was loaded up with atmosphere, exploration and an overwhelming sense of terrified wonder at the habits of an unfamiliar life form, James Cameron's sequel is faced with the task of expanding upon a theme that's already been fairly thoroughly prodded. Dropping the intellectual angles and dramatic pauses in favor of unbridled, run-and-gun chaos, it still manages to feel akin to its predecessor via more than a monster suit and lead actress. While Aliens doesn't take as much time to appreciate the sights, they're still around, and they remain excellent examples of on-screen world building. The power of the aliens themselves seems very diminished - they're little more than waves of cannon fodder by the second act - but Cameron compensates with a bold determination to examine them as a versatile breed of fauna. Although its dalliances into action tripes can be distracting, and a few lines of dialog are eyeball-spinningly cheeseball, the film is still a success. How much of that is due to its young director's touch, rather than the power of the galaxy that had been established in the original, is open for debate."
"k-schwertl92","9","0","1","9 July 2013"," Action at it's best
","Damn this film rocks. Don't trust me, watch it. This is THE most perfect form of a blockbuster. This film is aware of itself, it knows what it is. Back when James Cameron knew how to make awesome movies, he made unforgettable classics like this. The animatronic and practical effects are just amazing, and by far better than most of todays crappy cgi effects.<br/><br/>It's a film that will always be on top of the food chain. Even if the coolest characters are female (Ripley and Vasquez) this film is pure Testosteron. The only way this film would have turned out to be more manly would have been if Arnold Schwarzenegger would have joined the cast.<br/><br/>Actually thats the only minus to this film. It would have been great to see Arnold killing some Aliens with his manlyness."
"Blueghost","Null","0","1","27 June 2013"," Let's rock!!!!
","I don't have too much to say about this film, other than it helped confirm the flavor for many an extracurricular activity I engaged in with friends. Whether it was playing games, going to a football game, going to see an entirely different movie, or grabbing a pizza, it was always ""Let's rock!""<br/><br/>""Let's rock!"" is derived from gunners in fire teams expressing their ability to lay down support fire in a fire fight. The gunner in the past was armed with an M-60 machine-gun based on the old German 88 design. ""Let's rock!"" means to cut loose with heavy sustained fire, or to return fire when engaging an enemy that's firing upon you. So it is that Vasquez, one of the support gunners in the platoon return's fire when the movies bad guys make themselves known.<br/><br/>I don't have too many criticisms of the film other than some of the miniatures don't hold up when translated to the small screen. That's a problem that's as old as Godzilla films when the Japanese monsters lost their size and weight when broadcast to homes. The majesty of the size of seeing something on the big screen adds visual weight to miniature, and when shrunken down, not everything in the shot translates. That happens here, but not always.<br/><br/>The characters and their presentation border on Hollywood's cliché Central Casting, but get their point across with a strong solid story. Weaver returns as Ripley, she meets up with a combination of military and company heads to discover what has happened to a colony.<br/><br/>If I had a criticism about this film, and I don't have many, it's firstly that Bruce Cmaeron films tend to be over the top in dramatic content. Just when you think things are settled there's another challenge to be met. Just when you think the last of the aliens has been dealt with, there's something else lurking around the corner. That works to heighten the action, but it does get predictable and wearisome after a while. Notably the same kind of film making reared its head in ""Avatar"", the 3D CGI ho-hum Pocahontas in space that Cameron brought to the screen a couple of years back.<br/><br/>The other critique that I have is more to do with Hollywood itself. Being an instrument of social mental health, Hollywood has decided that the only warfare in space that is to take place is against dumb aggressive ""evil"" predators like the aliens in this film, or space- Nazis. The reason that's important is because from Avatar to Star Wars to Star Trek to name-your-sci-fi franchise, we'll never see a sequel where said same colonial (US) marines will take on a group of soldiers from another space faring state, because in Hollywood social-mental- health speak, that's a taboo concept that is actively repressed. Ergo the bad guys will always be aliens or clone storm troopers from the Star Wars (and like) films. Why is that important? Well, if all mankind has to face are aliens, dangerous animals, so to speak, then why have soldiers at all in the first place?<br/><br/>But never mind. You're not supposed to think about that.<br/><br/>The film is filled with lots of raw energy and lots of solid performances for leads and support thespians. No one misses a mark. And Bruce Cameron competently helms this sci-fi space-actioner to bring us a bit of horror mixed in with some military gun fights to settled score.<br/><br/>Over the top in the story and action department, but tempered with likable and unlikable characters, this film will definitely entertain (it's the kind of film I want to see more of, but they don't make anymore).<br/><br/>Highly recommended. See it again and again.<br/><br/>Get your girlfriend to watch it with you...make her watch it with you and your hardcore military buddies.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

What a shame Carrie Hern never made another film (apparently she became a teacher?)as she's the best child actor in history, her performance is just great, especially in the Special Edition where she's given a lot more to do. <br/><br/>Great action sequences, we actually all cheered at the ""Get away from her you BITCH!"" scene and I would have loved to have seen it in the cinema where apparently audiences did the same en masse. Fantastic writing and characterisation, not just in the action scenes and dialogues but in terms of the motivation and actions, there isn't a single character who does anything where you think 'Oh come on!', everybody acts totally logically. The clever thing about Paul Reiser's character is you expect him to be evil but for a long time he's not. Fantastic music too, really adds to it in terms of excitement and mood.<br/><br/>So what does the studio do? Give the sequel to David Fincher who could not have done more to ruin the series if he had been TRYING to! But my boy Joss rescues it in Resurrection (hence the title) and you note that in the last scene Newt asks Ripley can she dream and Ripley replies 'We both can' so I figure Alien 3 and 4 are just their dreams whilst in hypersleep on the way home."

","It would have been so easy to simply churn out another retread, as certain other horror franchises were doing at the time. Alien itself had spawned numerous rip-offs and imitators. It would take someone with a lot of guts and damn-them-all attitude to make something altogether different. Enter James Cameron, hot off his success from instant cult classic The Terminator. Fortuitously, some of his ideas for a sequel to Alien were not far off ideas producers Walter Hill and David Giler had. Hill and Giler after producing Alien, had also worked together in criminally underseen 1981 film Southern Comfort, which is similar in many ways to Aliens. Essentially, Aliens brings a Vietnam War vibe into the future, and ties it in with the Alien universe, and it makes for a perfect companionship.<br/><br/>Ripley is discovered by a salvage team. Upon revival, she learns she has been drifting in space for 57 years. When interviewed, her story is treated with scorn, and she learns there's more to it than simple disbelief - in the time she has been in space, the planetoid LV-426, which the Nostromo set down on, has been colonised, and 20-30 families now live there.<br/><br/>Her life at a low ebb, able only to get a job working in cargo docks, and suffering from post-traumatic stress, she is visited by slimy company rep Burke and Colonial Marine Corps Lieutenant Gorman, and informed contact has been lost with the colony on LV-426, and in order to take precautions, a team of Marines are being sent there, and they need Ripley onboard as adviser in case what she has been telling everyone turns out to be true. On the flight aboard the mean-looking USS Sulaco, we meet the Marines. The quiet Hicks, the loudmouthed Hudson, tough-as-nails chick Vasquez, battle-scarred Drake who the film implies has a close relationship with Vasquez, our regular hardass Sergeant Apone, the whining Ferro, Frost who doesn't care if what he's having sex with is male or female so long as it's Octurian, Spunkmeyer who no doubt was bullied a lot in school, medic Dietrich, plus two no-one notices until they die - Crowe and Wierzbowski. Then of course there's android Bishop that Ripley is naturally distrustful of. Burke comes along for the ride as company rep. Gorman is in command, but it becomes obvious that he's inexperienced, and like Alien, we see even in the future class issues - this officer is 'too good to eat with the rest of us Marines'.<br/><br/>While some may find all this preamble slow, those who are a little more patient will find the closer the Sulaco gets to the planet, the more a feeling of dread starts to seep in. As Ripley and the Marines are flown by dropship to the main colony complex, it's all too quiet down there, with no sign of life whatsoever. As the Marines explore inside, it becomes clear Ripley's story wasn't bogus - there are clear signs everywhere the colonists have been in conflict with lifeforms that bleed acid judging from scorched metal and melted spots. Confirmation is provided by the discovery of facehugging parasites seen stored in one compartment. Amazingly, they come across just one survivor, a young girl who calls herself Newt. When Hudson is able to detect personal data transmitters - beacons surgically implanted in every colonist to keep track of - they are seen to be grouped together in the deep levels of the atmospheric processor which makes the planet's air breathable for humans. When the Marines go in, we soon discover the fate of the colonists, and the titular creatures finally enter the fray...<br/><br/>...From that point on, the film becomes an intense battle for survival as the Marines find themselves on the losing side when the aliens prove far more formidable an opponent than they were expecting. Ripley, with the help of Hicks, tries to figure a way to get off the planet when an alien gets on board their dropship, causing it to crash, and do it fast as they face death at the hands of HUNDREDS of the critters, as well as annihilation when damage to the atmospheric processor causes a chain reaction that gives them four hours before the whole thing goes up in 40 megaton fireball.<br/><br/>While not perhaps as visually resonant as it's predecessor, it's a far better sequel than anyone could have hoped for - and indeed better than some give it credit for. This pays great respect to Alien, while going off in a different direction, combining claustrophobic horror with intense action scenes, so intense that some cinema-goers upon its 1986 release complained of feeling physically ill. James Horner's score, although a tad reminiscent of his score for Star Trek II - and with a whiff of 2001 - helps pump the adrenaline. The film's lengthy running time almost feels too short - this is a film that you never want to end. It goes further when other action films would have called it quits. The final 40-plus minutes especially never lets up, culminating in a showdown between Ripley, and a very different kind of alien which helped solve the question of what was laying all those eggs."

No matter what decade you were born in you should watch and enjoy this movie! It transitions smoothly from being a suspense flick to an action flick and back and forth and back and forth. Rarely do we get movies like this one even today. James Cameron takes the eerie creature that stalks the crew of the first movie and turns them into a powerful parasite that stalks an entire platoon. Despite the third film taking a slight step backward (I completely omit the 4th from every being made and don't even mention AvP) the Xenomorph will always be the most terrifying and intimidating creature Hollywood has ever created."

","Review of the Director's cut:<br/><br/>Aliens it was the perfect follow up to Alien (1979), because it used the same elements of the previous story (the xenomorphs, Ripley, the dark corridors) without looking like the previous one at all. The introduction of the colonial space marines contribute to make this movie, a great space action film. Fortunately the way they are portrayed does not make them look silly (differently from Starship Troopers for example), and you get the feeling you get to know the few members of Sulaco's crew.<br/><br/>The director's cut version adds a lot to the movies: - It shows you the life in LV-426 before all of them got infected, and therefore when they show the colony completely abandoned after the arrival of the marines, the impact is even bigger. - It shows you the moment when they tell Ripley that her daughter just passed away because she has been in stasis for 57 years!<br/><br/>Unfortunately in my opinion the last 30 minutes of the movie were just not interesting enough (it kind of dragged a bit). Starting by the moment when Ripley decided to go to the basement to kill the queen. I understand that they had to show the queen, they could have fit her in some other moment of the movie. The last half hour is just a bunch of explosions and cliché phrases.<br/><br/>I still love Aliens though. Probably not as much as the 1st one.<br/><br/>Score (8)"

","Aliens is a phenomenal sequel that surpasses the original. The roller coaster suspense is perfectly paced and the environments that are explored are all classic sets that give the film a wonderful down-to-earth feel. The special effects hold up surprisingly well after all these years, and the Aliens in the film look awesome and their design is wonderfully grotesque. The performances here are all extremely strong, from child actor Carrie Henn to android Lance Henriksen, all the way to Sigourney Weaver's intense performance. Bravo! The rest of the elements that make Aliens great are almost all there. <br/><br/>The music is decidedly more generic and more intense to capture the greater emphasis of the ""action movie"" tones, but the lighting and atmospherics are all in full effect. The classic introduction that was so gleefully eerie in the first film makes a decidedly shorter appearance, but it still captures that classic Alien feel. In fact, the whole film nearly captures the classic Alien style, just in different ways. The action is stronger, the threats are bigger, and the intensity is incredibly augmented by a time limit on the whole expedition. For fans, this is that perfect sequel; the unicorn of the movie universe, and an incredible feat. <br/><br/>5 Stars - A film classic"

","Aliens (directed by James Cameron:Terminator,Titanic,avatar)is one of my favourite movies of all time. While Alien was mostly a horror film in space, Aliens takes the series in a different direction, but does it perfectly. Sigourney Weaver (my favourite actress) returns as Ripley and does an even better performance than last time, and this movie gives Ripley much more plot development and depth. Even though this movie is mostly action,but it still has very good scary moments in too. The action scenes are some of the best for its time,as are the special effects. The rest of the characters in the movie are also very well developed characters, I especially like Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and Hudson (Bill Paxton). The scene at the end with the queen alien is one of the best final scenes in any movie.

"kevinxirau","10","0","1","9 March 2013"," Magnificent, isn't it?
","James Cameron, you really outdid yourself! I remember watching this when I was a kid many times and being frightened to death and back because of this movie. The movie ""Alien"" established the groundwork for the story and gave us one of the most iconic and terrifying monsters in cinematic history. At the time, the Xenomorph seemed like an unstoppable killer, much like classic slasher villains like Jason Vorhees and Freddy Kruegar, but now not only do we multiple aliens but we also see them in actual combat with space marines. In space, no one can hear you scream...or get blown up.<br/><br/>Ellen Ripley has been in cryogenic sleep in space for fifty-seven years, but the amount of time and distance traveled can not make her forget the horror of the creature that killed her crew. Just as she was deemed psychologically unfit to carry on her job thanks to the evil Weyland-Yutani Corp, contact was lost to the colony established on LV-426. Brought as a consultant, Ellen returns to the desolate planet with a group of tough-as-nails marines. Soon after a little girl named Newt is found as the only survivor, Ellen and the marines discover a horrifying truth: the Xenomorphs have returned and they are faster, stronger, and smarter than previously thought. Realizing that time is not on their side, our heroes must band together if they hope to escape this horror and wipe out the aliens once and for all. Otherwise, it's game over, man! <br/><br/>First off, we have an iconic cast of characters from the leading lady Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, Michael Beihn as the level-headed Hicks, Bill Paxton as the hilarious Hudson (most of the famous lines of the movie come from him), Jennete Goldstein as the no-nonsense Vasguez, and Carrie Henn as the heartwarming Newt. Even Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop is a great character. All these guys are a delight to watch, just the way they play off each other is done very well, especially the developing bond between Ripley and Newt.<br/><br/>The design of the Xenomorphs is done by the late Stan Winston, responsible for creature effects of films such as Terminator and Jurassic Park. Definitely the coolest look for these parasitic creatures. I also love the further exploration of the creature's biology and life style, the most iconic moment that demonstrates this is the introduction of the Alien Queen, a masterpiece of special effects at the time. The action scenes are also worth noting. They're awesome to watch, full of twists and turns, and the weapons the marines use sure put up a fantastic light show. The music is great, very memorable and sometimes very unnerving. Finally, the film utilizes suspense to its fullest, keeping you on your tones for something bad to happen and even then you may feel yourself unprepared for what pops up.<br/><br/>I may have tiny nitpicks, but they don't spoil the fun. This is undoubtedly one of the best sequels in film history, surpassing the first film by a mile. Even to this day, many fans consider this to be the best of the franchise, to which I have to agree. It's a shame ""Alein 3"" kinda ruined some things that made this one excellent. Aliens is a movie that truly stands on it's own and I doubt any crappy remake can steal the show from this sci-fi experience. Like the Xenomorphs themselves, this movie is a perfect organism."

","One of those rare moments when a sequel is as good as its predecessor. It starts off from where the first one left off (so watch the first one). Here we have Ripley going back to face her demons but this time she is accompanied by a group of marines. In the first installment it was cat and mouse but here it's all out action. James Cameron delivers a fast paced full throttle action packed monster of a movie doing what he does best. A cast full of zest and testosterone but once again coming up against an enemy which is not only powerful but smart. The pace is fast the cast full of memorable characters and again Ripley is left to save the day. This time round we get to see a little more of the aliens and they are just as terrifying in groups as they are alone. Guns flame throwers grenades tanks rockets space ships are really no match for the aliens. But they do try. It's fun and thrilling all the way to the breathtaking climax scene well worth the wait. Thoroughly enjoyable and probably one of the best action sci-fi films ever made."

","James Cameron has made something of a name for himself -- winner of three Academy Awards and director of not only the highest-grossing film of all time, but also the SECOND highest-grossing film as well. I would argue, however, that he made his best film before all that success and fame in Aliens, sequel to Ridley Scott masterly classic Alien.<br/><br/>Aliens expands from Alien's framework, adding a larger setting, a larger cast, larger-than-life emotions and, of course, large military equipment and a macho attitude. Aliens still features H. R. Giger's horrifying creature design and uses it to great effect, but pits that terror against the hardened elite troops of humans. This time we are fighting back.<br/><br/>While Aliens is a horror film, it resembles a war film as well, with all the shooting, running and military jargon. Fans of the original may dislike this, but I feel it would've been a waste to just try to repeat Alien. The enemy is stronger and has multiplied, and the stakes are higher -- this time we are not only fighting for survival, we are defending the weak.<br/><br/>The acting is good and the dialogue has some unforgettable gems."

","An overlooked classic. <br/><br/>Many people may disagree but the general thoughts that spring to mind over this immensely popular franchise - as far as success is concerned - is Ridley Scott's original 1979 sci-fi horror 'Alien.'

","After watching this back in the 80's , I was thinking this is a great sequel and a nice wrap up to the story. I wasn't even thinking about any more sequels. Unfortunately, they went in a different direction and really killed the series with Aliens3 - I did not pay to see it because of all the negative publicity and just the fact that it really wasted the characters that were saved from the previous movie. I watched it later on and it was lousy and the whole story line disappointing . Alien resurrection was another bad attempt to revive the series and really you ask why? . I cant put all the Alien crossover stuff in the same category like Alien/Predator and all the comic book ones with Batman and Superman etc because they are all cash ins off Alien and not original ideas .I mean anyone can take something and toss it in the mix - like say Cowboys Vs Aliens where you start making stuff up and throwing it together. Like all the Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ideas because people start doing weird things - It can make for a fun movie but when you start milking the original idea too much and diluting it - it is just tired and needs to be left alone.

","Tell me one sequel that has the power to succeed with taking away the thing that made the first a classic.. That's right. You either have nothing or this film right here, Aliens. Aliens is another entry to the trilogy, this time James Cameron taking the job. But what he does could be considered irrational. He completely dismembers the horror aspect of the series, dismembers the atmosphere the first contained, and then finally dismembered the one thing that the first had to make it a classic. With all this removed, what could we even possibly have? The outcome could either be bad or even worse. But no, James Cameron knew what he was doing. His brain functioned all this stuff to still make a sequel happen, even facing the fact that had a chance happening: ruining Scott's vision. But no. Nothing above happened. He made an action film. <br/><br/>Now I hate saying Aliens is just purely an action film. It's not even close to what your thinking. And if you're expecting non-stop action, again, you're out of luck. Aliens first has a slow-burn beginning that continues the Ripley story arc. Well, when I first heard the term ""slow- burn"" I would expect something boring, or just unnecessary. But the film has time to develop it's characters, begin it's narrative, and introduce what kind of film we are getting into. And it was fantastic. Then the film goes into it's action territory, which all I could expect is a pure clichéd mess. Wrong. The film twists and turns every minute of the ride. Some scenes my heartbeat beat simultaneously with the character's in the film, others the tension had me at the edge of my seat. It was nothing as I would expect, because the film keeps doing this trick one after another. It was surely an intense experience. And, yes, Cameron may of completely destroyed Scott's envision for his series, but he implanted something no one would expect: an action-film, but there's more. The film contains some heart, and then some soul. It knows it's territory, and it knows it's not going to go where others have. Aliens was a treat for the ones who found Alien boring, and although the original is still better, Aliens is probably the closest a sequel can get to it's source material...<br/><br/>I would recommend this to fans of Alien, and also the non-fans. The film embarks you on this intense journey that keeps twisting and turning until the credits begin to roll. And hearing the term ""action"" might put you off, but it contained so much more. Aliens proves that sequels can become masterpieces, just as where they originated from. Aliens proves that sequels can be good, and also come closer to what they were originated off of.<br/><br/>10/10."
"Robin_clarke41","10","0","3","26 April 2012"," Best film ever made period and it's a sequel!
","I loved this film from the spooky opening scene all the way through to the adrenaline filled epic battle scenes later on. Cameron has created without doubt the most realistic and believable fictional world and characters ever seen. The space marines are tough and speak like real military personnel. I believe this was achieved by sending the actors to military style boot camps where actors were in character (I.e a commander was to be obeyed). I also read that actors whose characters had not met were kept separate for a more realistic interaction when filming started. They act like real people not badly written robotic characters that show no fear/emotion. When these guys are scared they look terrified and with good reason. Introducing the first scary aliens ever presented in a movie. HR Gigers creature design plays on the psyche with its flawless but deadly physiology. The aliens move in a silky, graceful motion and are believable as silent deadly predators. I read that this was achieved by using ballet dancers to achieve the poise and grace required for such a perfect killer.<br/><br/>I have never seen a film so well structured as Aliens. Every scene has vital part to play in the movie. When I finally saw the extra scenes in the directors cut I was even more impressed. These were fantastic scenes but were removed to give perfect balance.<br/><br/>Every actor/actress in this movie deserves an Oscar. It is a master class in the portrayal of a wide variety of emotions. Sigourney Weaver's Ripley feels so real you could almost reach into the screen and touch her. She obviously understood exactly what Cameron wanted from the role. Other special mentions go to Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn who play very convincing soldiers.<br/><br/>In short this is the final word in sci-fi movies. All sci-fi to date has taken something from Aliens and it's easy to see why. It's not only a triumph in the sci-fi genre though, this is a template for how great any movie can be. If you haven't seen it yet I am VERY jealous. I wish I could erase it from my memory and see it again for the first time. It is in my opinion the best movie ever made by some way. Do not think I am some sci-fi fanatic and am just obsessed with this movie, it just really is that good! If you haven't seen it yet you're I'm for a real treat!"

This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you. By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times). The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson). The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digital manipulation. I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also. The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release. Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit. Aliens is an outstanding show!"

However, when communication is lost with a colony on the planet where the alien ship was originally found, Ripley is sent out with a group of Space Marines to check it out.<br/><br/>The film is buoyed by several great performances. Sigourney Weaver once again does well as Ripley, lending the character strength that makes her survival convincing. She also establishes the bonding with Newt, Bill Paxton also gives a memorable performance as the loudmouthed Hudson. However, the real stand out of the cast is Lance Henriksen as the android Bishop. Initially set up as a villain similar to Ash from the first movie, he turns out to be a well rounded character. <br/><br/>As stated earlier, the film is more about action than horror. At times, the film succumbs to some of the problems of the action genre. At the end, Ripley's rampage through the Queen's nest, although it is cathartic for the audience, seems like a profoundly stupid move. Rather than escape largely unnoticed from the hive, Ripley chooses to enrage the largest, most dangerous alien, nearly getting herself and Newt killed. This is out of character, and seems to exist only to create a more thrilling climax.<br/><br/>Still, Aliens is a great film, and definitely worth buying."
"Kubris","8","0","3","23 November 2011"," So far the only sequel I liked better than the original.
","IMDb Top 250: 60<br/><br/>I had some interesting bias going into Aliens. I thought Alien was a good movie (8.2) but I didn't like it too much, but I won't explain why here (I reviewed it). Also, James Cameron directs this film. I hate, HATE Avatar, was underwhelmed by T2, but did enjoy The Terminator. <br/><br/>I really liked Aliens.<br/><br/>Aliens makes its predecessor seem like an appetizer. Everything in that film existed for the more fleshed-out world of this one. The Alien's brilliant design is actually seen and used here, there's action while keeping tension, and there's a sense of plot development that didn't exist in Alien. This adds up to the best sequel ever in my opinion, and one of the best sci-fi's ever made.<br/><br/>57 years after Alien, Ripley is found and learns the planet has been colonized, but contact has been lost. It's strange to think that the other characters look around the same age as her, but could be her grandchildren. However once we get past that, the plot sails. Ripley, with a cast of marines, returns to discover what happened. The drop-off and discovery of the base clearly influenced one of the best levels in Halo. As said before, the film is tense, even with big guns. Once on the planet, it always feels like something is happening. No sitting around.<br/><br/>The acting is fitting. Weaver is her strong, female lead character, and gets some great lines. (""Then bill me!"") The marines vary from charming to stupid, but have personality, unlike the cast of Alien. There are clichés, like the nervous first time boss, the black, cigar chewing sergeant, the tough Spanish girl, the dopey, big-gun carrying brute, and the smart leader played by Kyle Reese. I mean Michael Biehn. But you aren't watching Aliens as a character study.<br/><br/>The second the little girl was found, I thought: ""Oh great a kid."" I hate kids in movies like this. They're baggage. The Walking Dead, Terminator 2, and River's Edge have kids that have to be dragged around or should be punched in the face. But Aliens' girl is different, mixing adorable, innocent, and knowledgeable. One of the best uses of children in mature film.<br/><br/>I can think of several series that expanded in sequels- Halo and Riddick, to keep inside the genre. Halo succeeded, Riddick did not. Aliens definitely did, and did it first. Where Halo exponentially expanded lore, and Riddick... went a ridiculous direction, Aliens gives a tight, focused expansion. We see more locations, tech and creatures, and it's interesting and cool.<br/><br/>There are some good effects, too. Aliens has aged much better than Alien or The Terminator, even if it is a few years younger. We finally see Aliens for more than a split second, and I think the acid blood was awesomely used. In zombie movies, you ask yourself why the characters aren't infected even when covered in zombie blood. Don't worry about that in Aliens. The facehuggers moving about and the end creature are awesome looking.<br/><br/>Aliens has it all. Effects, creatures, action, and a plot. An essential action and sci-fi film. 8.5/10"

","For fans of the genre, this is the ultimate movie. Non-stop action and, yes, creepiness. For one, although this is a sequel to a classic movie, this is (considered by me) also a classic. And it's easy to pick up on if you haven't seen the first movie, although seeing the first one is recommended. Besides that, there's countless jump scenes, shooting sprees, and suspense to go around. And heads-up! This movie does have a lot of gore in it. Be warned. The end is a bit predictable - it's easy to tell that the Alien Queen snuck aboard the escape ship. And unlike the first Alien movie, there's more than one survivor. But stuff like that can be expected from almost any film. Sci-Fi and horror fans - I recommend this for you! It's a must-see in the genre!"

","After the raising terror of 1979's Alien came out, it shocked audiences in movie cinemas. Now, this time it's war. Aliens is a excellent, well-made, action-packed film. Aliens stars Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, reprising the role as the human sole survivor of the Nostromo cargo ship.

When the team arrives on the planet where mysterious disappearances of colonists on LV-426, they investigates and find out that they are not the only ones on the strange planet. This movie has a lot of action, better than the first Alien. Director James Cameron has a lot of good and neat special effects to bring in this action flick. The thrills? Well, they just keep coming closer and closer to the victims. Aliens has some good action sequences and all though the first Alien was about suspense in space, this one deals with action more than the horror. Still, Aliens is a good sequel to the 1979 shocker and a thrilling ride from start to finish. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars ."

"Timeee","8","0","1","1 April 2010"," They mostly come at night ... Mostly ...
","The debate is usually between Alien being more subtle & darkish while Aliens more full of action. I personally liked this one better, but think that the first part is the better movie- it is more balanced, obviously more original and, if the term has any sense in this genre, more realistic.<br/><br/>All in all Aliens had the atmosphere, the feeling & the courage it takes. I think the story was great, the characters each added something to the plot & the relations between them were well built-up and believable. Since I enjoyed the movie very much I won't go on listing all the individual elements I did like, instead I'll just note a few I didn't.<br/><br/>1. The movie should have ended when they get off the planet. The climax was consumed by that time: Newt had been saved through a daring incursion to the alien-nest and the surviving characters just narrowly escaped the big explosion. This is the natural ending of the story; everything that comes afterward feels like a bonus action-scene, so that viewers are satisfied for their money. Not necessary.<br/><br/>2. The marines should have been given some better lines. At some points they were becoming pretty ridiculous & stereotypical. And by the way, how on Earth can soldiers act with so little discipline? I mean you f**k around with your mates- OK; during instruction- still no problem; while being given direct orders by your superior- come on?!?, and even while in action- I mean these guys were professionals and yet were sometimes acting like children.<br/><br/>3. This is just a small observation: what happened to the girl interpreting Newt? Why didn't she continue acting? She was appreciated, awarded, probably would have had a great career...she's a schoolteacher now...what a waste."

","This has got to be one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen. It's rare to come across a superior sequel and this movie by far surpasses the original. First of all, you get to see more of the aliens, and see them go about attacking and killing humans, while the humans think of different survival tactics, which is a lot of fun to watch them go about doing. second, although the characters in the first movie were dull, in this movie they are interesting and you actually care if some of them lives or dies or at least live long enough to know them a bit more or watch them in action some more, especially the character Bill Paxton plays. The special effects are also way ahead of it's time, and made good use of it. The dialogue in the movie which is a bit corny at times, is still fun to listen to especially some of the wisecracks some of the characters dish out. This movie by far the best in the quadrilogy so far...maybe ""Alien 5"" might change that which is currently in the process of being made by Ridley Scott.

"sheslovinit","8","0","3","4 September 2009"," One of the best sequels of all time.
","This movie ranks up there as one of the best movie sequels of all time for many reasons. For once, they didn't just remake the same movie, which is a common problem with most sequels, but they took it into a completely different -genre-. Whereas the first movie was an artfully realized cross between a haunted house movie and a monster tale, ""Aliens"" is a balls-to-the-wall science fiction action flick. This decision to take the story of the previous movie and transfer it into a completely new realm is what makes the story work as brilliantly as it does. There's also the satisfying feeling you get knowing that the people behind this picture genuinely cared about crafting a good movie, and not just making money (a common problem with most sequels).<br/><br/>The story picks up half a decade after the events of the first movie, when a deep salvage team stumbles across Lt. Ripley floating out in space, still in a deep hyper-sleep (which apparently keeps the subject from aging, it seems). She is rescued only to tell her story to a group of disbelieving suits that represent the company she once worked for, who promptly dismiss her claims that there are dangerous aliens roaming around on planet LV-426. They're soon proved wrong, however, when the company loses contact with a colony of civilians now living on the planet to help stabilize the atmosphere. The same company that screwed her over now asks Ripley to join a group of military grunts setting out to investigate the mysterious events, hoping her previous encounter with the species can prove useful. But once they set foot on LV-426, all hell breaks loose...<br/><br/>Director James Cameron could teach Michael Bay a thing or two about action films. This film starts off as a slow burn, taking time to introduce us to the colorful crew of the military ship Sulaco, and also setting the stage for an action-packed second half. Few modern directors would have taken the time to set everything up before cutting straight to the explosions--this absence of new millennium MTV-style editing is a welcome change of pace for those accustomed to modern action flicks that seem catered to ADD-riddled kids. We get to know these characters, so that when they do bite the dust, they're not just alien fodder. Cameron peppers the movie with an assortment of memorable characters that keep us interested even when there's not anything being shot at or blown up (how often can you say that for modern action films?).<br/><br/>The performances are worth mentioning in that they're all excellent. Sigourney Weaver is the standout here, obviously, taking her role of Ripley far beyond what we could imagine from the first movie. She is truly a fantastic heroine and one of the greatest female action characters of all time, as this movie proves so well.<br/><br/>This movie needs to be shown to certain big budget ""directors"" as evidence that plot, characterization, and good action can all be melded together into a fine piece of work. Thank you, ""Aliens"", for 2 1/2 hours of good, solid entertainment."

"freemantle_uk","10","0","3","12 August 2009"," James Cameron is a genius
","You got to love James Cameron, writer and director of two classic films, Terminator 1 and 2. The man has a cult following and fanboys the world over exploding with exciting before the release of Avatar. Aliens is his other great film, a sequel to the excellent Ridley Scott film Alien.<br/><br/>Set 57 years after the events of Alien, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is found in floating space still in a deep space. She expected to found in six weeks. Many people within the company disbelieve her story about the Alien and unhappy that she destroyed an expensive ship. Ridley learns that her daughter had died at the age of 66. Her pilot's license is revoked and she can only work as a warehouse loader. What she finds out that's more distressing is the LV-426 has been colonised by humans for 20 years and engineers were terraforming it for future generations. The colonialists hasn't had any contact with the aliens. However, during her time on the company spaceship Ripley is told that the company had lost contact with the colony. She is asked by the company representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), to go with him and Colonial Marines to investigate what happens. When the Marines arrive they discover that the whole base is deserted with no signs of live. That is until a young girl, Newt (Carrie Henn), the only survivor who had been hiding. She quickly develops a bond with Ripley. When the Marines discover a nest of the aliens they find out they are in the fight that seems impossible against an almight enemy.<br/><br/>Within the Marines is a tough team of experienced soldiers, but are led by a weak, inexperience lieutenant (William Hope), an tough sergeant (Al Matthews), Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), joker Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), stereotypical tough Latino Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and android and Science Officer Bishop (Lance Henriksen). All these characters have their own personalities and you get to care about them as individuals.<br/><br/>One of the reasons James Cameron is such a great writer/director is because his focus has always been on story and character. This is what happened in his Terminator films. In Aliens he expands on the Ripley character, showing she is suffering from psychological stress and suffers tragedy, but also becomes a tougher leader and has a surrogate mother/daughter relationship with Newt (one of the key points of the film). Paul Reiser was able to show the duality of his character, making him seem to be a nice guy, an ally to Ripley but quickly shows his true colours when the mission starts. Hicks forms a close friendship to Ripley and show his leadership skills. Even minor characters like Apone, Vasquez and Hudson are interesting and grow on you. I personally see the character of Lieutenant Gorman as a criticism of young career officers in the army who haven't proved themselves and get run missions they are not ready for. Newt is a great character, a sweet young girl who suffers a lot but still gets to act like a child. A great little moment is when she tries on a soldier's helmet.<br/><br/>Alien is film that seemed it didn't need a sequel, having Ripley survive the alien and killing it. But James Cameron thought he could do a sequel, and he did it very well. He was able to expand on the characters and the world she lives in. Humans are expanding in the universe and colonisation is done by private companies, like the East India Company in the 18th Century. It is also a criticism of multi-national corporations who only think about profits regardless of human life and a general criticism of the weapons industry. James Cameron personally see the film as a metaphor for the Vietnam War, with American soldiers seeming the stronger with better weapons, but are fighting an unseen enemy in a foreign environment. He also sees it as innocent soldiers going off to fight for business interests. James Cameron also sets up a excellent sci-fi world, with great set-design and special-effects. James Cameron shows what he is best at, sci-fi and action, with great battle scenes. But he also has some great motions of horror for horror-fans. With the writing of the film, there is a strong simple plot, excellent dialogue, which is well-delivered by the cast, important character development and some classic one-liners.<br/><br/>There is a good cast, Sigourney Weaver grows even more into her role. Michael Biehn is excellent under James Cameron, and many of the supporting roles are filled by fine actors. Carrie Henn was an excellent child actress. James Cameron likes to have strong female characters in his film, which is always good to see. Cameron also brought in his other major theme, nuclear war. It always plays a part in his films.<br/><br/>Aliens also has an excellent score by James Horner, which adds to the atmosphere of the film and easily his best work.<br/><br/>Aliens is my favourite of the series. A must see for action, sci-fi, horror and James Cameron fans."

I said that I had never seen it before but I would like to. He then got it from his car. Fifthteen minutes into the movie I was hooked. The way the Colonial Marines acted was really cool. It looked like James Cameron really put some research into how Army manuevers are done. The aliens were really scary but so cool. There was good character development as well.

"mrspasm","10","0","3","10 June 2009"," Not as good as first, incredibly dark.
","Riply Scott's prequel to this film was a tale of intergalactic terror. Seven friends and their Bumbling Side-kick Jones were travelling home after a long vacation when they encountered a monster. Hearing it's distress call, they let it board their ship, but rather than show its gratitude, it decided to kill off the friends one by one in a terrifying game of cat and monster. The survivors from that film appear again here, namely Captain Ridley and of course Jonesy our heroic side kick. Ridley wants revenge for the death of her friends and recruits a team of super tough marines (that's soldiers to the lay person) to go to their home planet and wipe out the monsters once and for all. This darker tone is in stark contrast to Riply Scott's original, and it continues throughout. This leads to a series of let downs- Jones disappears without explanation early in the film, without explanation so much of the comedy from the first film is lost. Add to this the lack of Cyborg Ash, whose little dance was a hilarious highlight of the first and there are few laughs to be found here. Bill Pullman's marine Ernie 'Dry Heat' Hudson attempts some improvised one liners 'Hey Vasquez- you look like a man!' and tries some banter with his Sergeant 'Can I wear your slippers, Sir?' he asks 'LOOK AT MY EYES!' Capone riplyies. I didn't really understand this comeback, but I assume The Searg was in no mood for fun and games. This is obviously because the film was under the fierce stranglehold of famous control freak Jim Cameroon, known for a lack of humour in all his films. Cameroon reluctantly casts Paxman in all his films as they're cousins and there is a definite tension between the comic genius of the actor, and the ultra serious 'I'm The Daddy' mentality of the Director.<br/><br/>Ridley and crew fly down to the planet to hunt down the monsters but are shocked to find a survivor- a little boy called Newt. This is a deliberate attempt to soften the almost unrelenting darkness of the film, and possibly bring in a wider female audience who may enjoy the mother/son relationship which develops between Ridley and Nuke. The child doesn't talk much which in fact adds to the bleak tone, and the fact that he carries around a decapitated doll's head is rather disturbing. I mean, everyone knows boys don't play with dolls. Newt mumbles things like (in response to Ridley asking if he's hungry) 'I'm mostly scared. Mostly' and the bizarre 'Hi, Firmative!'. Presumably Firmative is some imaginary friend, or possibly futuristic slang. Through into the mix the fact that among the marines is a geeky science geek who wants to steal one of the monster eggs to bring home and experiment on or sell or something. Indeed, he hatches a plan to impregnate one of the gang with the egg so that no-one suspects anything. I think if I woke up with an 8 foot monster mounting me in an attempt to give me its seed, I might suspect something was not right. But back to the film. The gang underestimates the sheer number of the monsters (at least 25) and the fact that their King is on the island too, and soon it is the humans that are on the run. Cameroon is clearly adding a subtext here about man's destruction of nature and of other species, and that eventually it will turn around and we will be on the receiving end. I have studied film studies for at least a year, and have over a year's experience in social anthropology, so I know what I'm talking about. The last half of the film is really a series of chase scenes- in the alien base with tanks etc, in a bedroom with spider monsters, through the living quarters, and then into the sewers until The King wakes up. That's not to mention the super robot fight at the end which was a precursor to Cameroon's next film Terminator 2. So yes, there is much action and excitement, and lots of mistrust between characters which lends another level of tension.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are killed off, but all fight well and you really feel like you got to know them. Ridley is a true mother- fighting for her family and friends, strapping on a grenade launcher to take on the bullies, Hudson is a comedian but also a bit of a moaner, Capone, Hicks, and Vasquez are all super tough and ultra cool. There is also Bishop, a cyborg who doesn't dance but preaches the Gospel and does magic tricks with knives. Perhaps if Riply had directed this he would have let some more comedy in, and it would have been a stronger film. At times I wanted to jump into the TV, grab a gun and help out my chums, pumping bullets into skulls. 'Come on, man! Shoot them! Here they come, quick, let's blow them away and get out of here! ARRGH!' I would have been shouting like that. Because the film is so dark and depressing though, I didn't have the energy to jump in and help. So all I could do was sit back and watch each of my friends get eaten, killed, or worse. Overall this is an excitement film, but Cameroon needs to relax and let some light in. I mean what's the point in having all these characters only for the planet to blow up at the end and kill them all? Best Scene: When the soldiers are walking through the alien corridors, and all the bleeps are getting closer, but no-one knows where they're coming from. It was quite scary, but would have been better if Hudson had jumped out with his underpants on his head and shouted 'ONLY ME!!!'"

","After losing her flying licence Ripley (Weaver) joins a group of soldiers to investigate the mysterious incidents on the alien inhabited planet.<br/><br/>James Cameron (The Terminator) takes over directional duties for this sequel to the widely popular Ridley Scott picture Alien. In the past it is fair to say many Sci-Fi sequels do nothing for the originals. The two Matrix sequels destroyed the question of reality from the first, Terminator 3 ruined the intensity and imagination of the future where the 3 prequels of Star Wars made viewers think it was a different set of adventures all together.<br/><br/>Cameron therefore must be praised for taking the risk to direct a film that had so much pressure and not only did he excite and entertain he took the concept and put a higher intensity and intrigue onto the narrative to make one of the finest Sci-Fi sequels ever.<br/><br/>After many contract negotiations Sigourney Weaver (Working Girl) reprised the role of Ellen Ripley and did a fine job of capturing that hard opinionated soul and putting her back right in the middle of a high octane adventure. Weaver earned an Oscar nomination for her trouble and there is no question that some recognition was deserved.<br/><br/>Being the only person from the original in the sequel she is allocated more screen time and her presence of the film what makes for riveting viewing, especially that look in her eye when confronting her enemy.<br/><br/>The narrative, whilst political and outdrawn to begin with opens up into an adrenaline soaked intellectual thriller once the team arrive on the planet. Scary and always for every second tense, Aliens conforms to its Sci-Fi and thriller genres with its depiction of mysterious creatures and investigations.<br/><br/>The settings are once again magnificent as Cameron builds on Scott's representation by making everything darker and more electrifying. Not only is the Alien base horrifying we see an equally horrifying moment when Ripley crawls into a space to see where Newt has been hiding alone, what must be one of the saddest moment in Sci-Fi.<br/><br/>But this moment isn't repeated as the film is all about the action and Cameron with his fast interchanging style reflects the passion of a perplexing narrative that continues to surprise and the tension, once on the planet, never lets up and in a personal opinion, I found this more entertaining and intriguing than its predecessor."
"HelloTexas11","8","0","1","6 January 2009"," exciting follow-up to a classic
","I once made the observation that 'Aliens' deserves an award for panache for trying to outdo 'Alien.' It would be more accurate to say it takes the story of Ripley and those slimy, malevolent lifeforms in a direction that the first movie didn't even try to; specifically, into the realm of action/adventure/combat flicks. To its credit, it keeps much of the original's look and feel, in art direction and sound. But the volume (so to speak) is cranked WAY up, as is the violence quotient, and the last 45 minutes or so feel like a roller-coaster ride through hell. Opinions differ whether or not this is an improvement; my own feeling is that 'Alien' is the superior film, hands down. But 'Aliens' certainly won the box office battle and has always been more generally popular. The plot has Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) going back to the deadly planet with a squad of 'colonial marines.' It is 57 years later (she slept that long in suspended animation before being discovered) and the planet is now inhabited by humans in a small, desolate community. The aliens (and there are a bunch of them now) never bothered the colonists until recently and when contact with Earth ceases, the marines are sent in and Ripley goes with them as a reluctant 'advisor.' The marines themselves are a colorful group of stereotypes, straight out of an old WW2 war flick- the tough-as-nails sergeant, the quiet loner, the two bad-ass machine gunners, the whiner, etc. They are led by an ineffective lieutenant who we soon discover isn't up to the challenge. Also along for the ride is the 'company man,' Burke (Paul Reiser, in a nice turn as a complete slimeball). After an early encounter with the aliens cuts their number in half, Ripley more or less assumes command by sheer force of personality. (And Weaver out-acts the pants off whoever she shares the screen with.) There are plenty of slam-bang shoot-'em-up sequences, all very well staged and very intense. But somewhere along the way, 'Aliens' diminishes the essential creepiness of the creatures just slightly by making them so often exploding targets. And the audience realizes long before the marines that it doesn't matter how many of them you kill, there are always more. A single colony survivor, a young girl named Newt, is adopted by Ripley and the others and proves more savvy than any of them. There is a funny, scary moment early on shortly after Newt is found; Ripley asks her if she wouldn't feel safer staying with Ripley and the others. The little girl just shakes her head no. Ripley goes on to say these are soldiers, and Newt responds, ""It won't make any difference."" After chases, explosions, more gunplay and one false climax, we get the final showdown between Ripley, in one of the spaceship's loaders, and the alien queen. (Trying to distract the queen from pursuing Newt, Weaver spits out her famous line, ""Get away from her, you bitch!"") The fight itself is fairly brief, and the queen is finally dispatched off out into space, much like the alien in the first film was. Director James Cameron certainly deserves credit for not making a boring sequel; 'Aliens' is anything but. It would probably be hoping for too much to expect a second film to be as wondrously terrifying as Ridley Scott's original; like capturing lightning twice, almost impossible. So Cameron wisely shifts gears and takes us on a different adventure altogether, and it's a very exciting one."
"notevenwordshere","8","0","3","20 September 2008"," The film that forever ruined human-alien relations
","What to make of a film whose only memorable contribution to cinema was the line ""Get away from her, you bitch!"" Spoken at a particularly joyous and tense climax by Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), it was just the line needed to turn a cheesy alien encounter into a cult classic.<br/><br/>Let's make one thing clear up front: Aliens is not better than Alien. James Cameron, fresh off the surprise success of The Terminator, is too euphoric in his direction to match the dark moods and creepy cinematography of Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece. But his ecstasy is both good and bad: good in that it saves this formulaic picture from mediocrity; and bad in that it robs it of the clarity of horror that possessed the first film. It's to Cameron's credit that he did not attempt to hide this shift in tone: the tagline was ""This time it's war,"" which seems a boast compared to the stark ""In space no one can hear you scream"" tag of Alien.<br/><br/>Aliens begins essentially where its predecessor left off: Ripley floating in space, sealed in a hypersleep chamber where she has been for the last 57 years. Upon waking, she tells her story and is later told that LV-426 -- the planet where her crew found the titular alien -- cannot be reached. Along with a group of Marines, Ripley goes to the planet to see what remains and to kill the aliens once and for all.<br/><br/>There are plenty of flaws to be found in this film. For one, the acting is less than stellar (except from Weaver and Michael Biehn); also the dialogue is horrible; and finally the supporting cast couldn't have been more one-dimensional. But the strengths outweigh these: the special effects are terrific; the action sequences are thrilling; and the film's emotional center -- the relationship between Ripley and Newt (Carrie Henn) -- is superbly handled.<br/><br/>Add to all this that there are plenty of willing viewers who liked the original movie and will sit through this one, and you have a strong sequel."
"AndreiPavlov","7","0","3","17 June 2008"," Mr Lance Henriksen pulls it to a more decent level
","The second installation, though miles better than the follow-ups, is nowhere near the original movie. I got the DVD for my collection only because of Mr Lance Henriksen. This actor is terrific in the role of Bishop. Everybody else in this movie is so-so. Hollywood makes a simple shoot-'em-all action out of a freaking sci-fi concept. We have too little left to our imagination. The aliens are not so frightening any more. I'm sure it is a solemn result of Mr Giger's absence and the absence of Mr Ridley Scott. These two guys should have done it in a much more depressing manner. ""Aliens"" should have been depressing and shocking to the core.<br/><br/>How would I improve the production? I would: 1. diminish chat-chat jokes of the marines considerably (come on, it's no ""Renegade Justice""); 2. not include aliens ""crowd scenes"" (many creatures don't necessarily mean more fear); 3. by no means show the scene with the queen laying eggs and a hundred of aliens running about (the viewer has been robbed and treated as a low-grade loser who has no imagination); 4. keep a few shouts away from the final product (cf. the one in the beginning when the astronaut is shown with a face-hugger attached to him and the kids start to yell); 5. make a more complex script with fewer real people and more androids to face aliens (sending a bunch of flesh-and-blood marines to fight the unknown beasts looks a bit lame and scientifically not justified).<br/><br/>Bishop saves the production. Otherwise it would have turned into a cheap popcorn flick. Well, yes, it's damn near that category but Mr Lance Henriksen pulls it to a more decent level. You are the Man.<br/><br/>7 out of 10.

","Like most of the sequels, Aliens can't compete with its renowned predecessor (certainly in field of tension). The characters are extremely superficial (practically caricatures), the acting is average, the dialogues are mindless and the storyline is rather poor. Yet in its genre, Aliens really is one of the most enjoyable and action-packed sci-fi flicks of all time. The second part of the movie in particular feels like a satisfying shoot'em up video game passing in front of your eyes. What makes the action a little different is the threatening atmosphere and the gloomy buildings in which the battle takes place. The deserted buildings, the barricades, the daily objects and food still lying where they were left, ... It all points to terrifying preceding events that we can only try to imagine. The fact that we didn't see what actually went on makes it so intriguing, a feature that also made the resident-evil games great. Furthermore, the small group of protagonists,the traitor/villain, the enemies that go down by the bunch and the final battle with the ""big boss"" all add to the video game sensation. So if you want to calm your nerves after a long day of work by playing some violent video game, but don't have the courage to pick up your controller, or if you just want some mindless action, go and give this movie a try."

","I loved this movie, along with Alien 1 and 3. But it's really hard not to see the holes in it. I don't mind the stupid dialogs, or the fact that the story is not very original. There are other disturbing facts in this movie. And here is one:<br/><br/>I really tried, but I simply can't go past the fact, that the marines have almost a SUICIDAL tactic. I mean, come on, COME ON!!!, it's a matter of common sense. They go into the lair, then find out they cannot use their main firepower, but still decide to investigate! Hostile territory, no room to maneuver, no idea on what the opposition is, not a clue on how the aliens react or move, no adequate ammo, and the list can go on... If I'm not wrong, they DON'T even know what the aliens look like. But still the marines push further into the ""lion's den"". Ripley should have been some sort of a consultant, but she was NOT!<br/><br/>The fight, itself, is full of stupid scenes, like the one where 2 marines just look on how the ammo is burning and of course die when it exploded... I also, really HATE scenes like: 1 marine, before dying, puts out of action, with the flamethrower, another marine (Frost i think) and so on... By the way, how did they end up in being cut off, as Ripley said, when they had Drake and Vasquez to clear the way with all that firepower??? <br/><br/>After the main battle, the movie takes a down fall. With only 4 marines left: 2 worthy ones, Gorman and a weeping Hudson(by the way, Bill has a really stupid role, how can a *bad-ass* marine be like that???), the movie is very, very predictable!!!<br/><br/>But, I still must rate it with 8 stars because I grew up with movies like this and I still enjoy seeing them."

For the first full hour, literally nothing happens, not that it's bad or anything. I was just bored. On the upside, the effects are much better and the make up effects were also very good.

I have seen every Alien film except the first one and I honestly think that so far, Aliens is a true classic (no offence Alien fans, I'm not trying to be prejudice).<br/><br/>As many of you know, Ripley, having spent 57 years in Hypersleep is found and awoken, but is disgusted to find that no-one believes her story! However, when the planet that she visited in Alien (now colonised by man) once again becomes hunting territory for the big drooling monsters (who subsequently munch on all the residents, save one), Ripley discovers that the only way to conquer her fear is to go back to the planet and confront it head on. With a bunch of foul-mouthed, ""badass"" marines, who blast everything in site to bits, and the ultra cool android Bishop, Ripley goes back to the planet, loaded with weapons (and later on, maternal passion). Surely all will go to plan...<br/><br/>James Cameron gave many people a chance to show different sides to their reputations if they were veteran actors, or show what they were made of if they were new, and many of the actors featured here (or in Terminator) became some of Cameron's favourites (step forward Michael Biehn {Terminator and Terminator 2 Judgement Day (Special Edition)}, Lance Henrikson {Terminator}, Bill Paxton {Terminator, Titanic} and Jenette Goldstein {Terminator 2 Judgement Day, Titanic}). Some were buffed up {Weaver, Goldstein}, some were slimy (Reiser), some were mellow (Henrikson, Biehn) and some were scene stealer's (Paxton). All in all, brilliant acting, great special effects (for 1986, especially the fight with the Queen) and an Action/Sci-Fi masterpiece. There is only one problem; not scary enough for a horror sequel (I know I haven't seen the first one but I know the plot inside out). Certainly it is tense in some places, but the ""horror"" is a bit predictable. 9/10 (one mark off for lack of decent horror)."

Don't get me wrong, Aliens is also a Sci-Fi Horror film in some way, but the action smothers the science fiction and the horror. However though, it's a good action movie with a plot which a liked a lot. Plus it doesn't try to rush any scenes whatsoever.

","57 years have passed since the attack on the Nostromo by a single Alien warrior, an attack which left only crew member Ellen Ripley alive. Suspended in cryogenic hypersleep, Ripley has been drifting in space all this time and is revived, only to learn that everything she knew is gone. Also during that time, the alien planet on which the deadly eggs were first discovered has been colonized. Now called LV426, the planet has been made habitable by atmosphere processors, but contact with the colony has been lost. A rescue mission of intergalactic Marines is sent in, and Ripley is brought along as a reluctant adviser. Ripley's fears are soon confirmed: the colony has been obliterated by the aliens and the survivors used as incubators for their embryos. Only one little girl has survived the destruction, a shell shocked second grader called Newt whom Ripley takes under her wing. As the Marines too fall prey to the aliens, Ripley and a small band of survivors find themselves stranded on LV426 with little hope of escape. With their equipment damaged and the planet's damaged reactors threatening to blow the entire world into a nuclear ruin within hours, the small group plans a dangerous escape mission. It becomes a race against time as the aliens close in, and when Newt is kidnapped by an alien warrior, Ripley comes face to face with the source of the alien colony - a huge and fiercely protective Queen Alien who is determined to take personal revenge on Ripley.<br/><br/>Where the first Alien film was a Gothic horror tale, Aliens is an action movie through and through, but still a damn good movie. The aliens are everywhere in this tense and exhausting sequel. There are gory chest bursters, sprays of acidic blood and, most impressive of all, the Alien Queen Herself, a gigantic and deadly mother with absolute authority. I love the standoff scene between her and Ripley, in which the Queen dismisses her bodyguards and the two mothers face off, each determined to protect her young. <br/><br/>The cast is top notch as well. Weaver makes a triumphant return as the battle scarred Ripley, who is NOT a fearless, ass kicking warrior woman, but a deeply frightened yet determined person with a truly heroic streak. Carrie Henn (who amazingly never made another film, either before or after Aliens) is perfect as Newt, the bright and solemn little girl with a pair of lungs like a car alarm. One of my favorite underrated actors Michael Biehn is here as well, playing Marine Corporal Hicks, a possible love interest for Ripley and father figure for Newt. Bill Paxton has entered into film icon territory with his portrayal of the cocky, but ultimately blubbering Pvt. Hudson, whose wails of ""It's a bug hunt, man! a bug hunt!"" have become a part of cinematic history. Cult film favorite Lance Henrickson is here too, playing the slightly suspicious but ultimately likable Bishop, an android who could have made Nexus proud with his More Human Than Human personality.<br/><br/>This is a really great sequel to the original masterpiece film Alien. It doesn't try to mimic or reproduce but instead veers off into a whole new direction, filled with fast paced action and a good, strong, intelligent storyline. It's fun, it's tense and it's scary, but it's also smart. The swarms of aliens in this one are really freaky, and no more so than when they find a way into the locked down base through a ceiling panel. This film never lets up for one minute and includes a great ""just when you thought it was over"" ending that will have you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>An awesome film!"
"barnabyrudge","9","0","1","4 January 2006"," Slam-bang sequel to ""Alien"" which is possibly even better than its predecessor.
","""Aliens"" is a terrific sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 sci-fi shocker ""Alien"". This time around the director is James Cameron and unsurprisingly the emphasis has been shifted onto hardware, with a narrative that features a bunch of marines blasting aliens away with some awesome weaponry (whereas, in the earlier film, the emphasis was on jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments). In my opinion, ""Aliens"" is actually slightly better than its predecessor because it is more visceral and urgent, and encourages more repeat viewings. Sigourney Weaver's character has evolved very appealingly too. In ""Alien"" she acted like a victim and her quest was merely to escape from the whole ordeal in one piece; in ""Aliens"" she is physically and mentally stronger and is quite prepared to take on the aliens, comforted with the knowledge that she has beaten them once before.<br/><br/>57 years have elapsed since the events narrated in ""Alien"" (1979). The one survivor of that ordeal - Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) - has spent the intervening years in deep space hibernation aboard an escape pod from her old craft the Nostromo. She is found floating in space by a team of astronauts and awakened from her lengthy slumber. Ripley is distressed to discover that the planet LV 426 - where she and her crew-mates originally found the alien species - has been colonised while she has slept. However, communications have recently been lost with the people at the colony and there are mounting fears that they may have been attacked by another alien or aliens. A team of crack marines are readied to travel out to the colony to find out what has happened. Ripley warns them that they don't know what they're getting into, nor do they appreciate the deadliness of the foe they are going up against. Still plagued by nightmares of her previous encounter with the alien, Ripley decides that the only way to exorcise her demons is to go with the marines on this new expedition and confront the monster once again. The team have barely been on the planet five minutes before the full horror of what has taken place hits home.... only this time, rather than one alien, there are hundreds of them. Many of the marines are killed in the initial skirmish, leaving Ripley and the token survivors - plus a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), who lived on the colony before the aliens struck, and has somehow survived the annihilation - to defend themselves against near insurmountable odds.<br/><br/>""Aliens"" is an exciting and frequently frightening ride and the film that, after ""The Terminator"", cemented Cameron's reputation as a film-maker of exciting ideas and technical chutzpah. The pace is superbly judged, with a long but worthwhile opening stretch that sets up the story and sketches in the characters, followed by about 90 minutes of non-stop suspense and drama. The actors have a ball with their macho heroics and quotable dialogue, especially Jenette Goldstein as a female marine named Vasquez who is arguably the toughest member of her unit. Cameron has always valued strong female characters in his movies, and the trio of Weaver, Henn and Goldstein really steal the show - and the action - from their male counterparts. The special effects hold up well even 20 years after the film's initial release, with convincingly scary and scaly aliens and bloody death scenes. The film builds to a now-legendary final showdown between Weaver and the mother-alien (the scene with the classic line: ""Get away from her, you bitch!"") and is a thrilling experience virtually every step of the way."

"Corky1984","Null","0","1","14 June 2005"," Outstanding sequel that replicates the glory of the first film
","Whereas Alien focused more on suspense, in Aliens the emphasis is on all out action and firepower. It doesn't disappoint! James Cameron directed the film, just two years after the success of Terminator and he was still clearly on top form back in 1986, long before the days of Titanic tarnished his legacy. The basic plot concerns the shady dealings of a big corporation which seeks to exploit the Aliens for financial reward, their value being high to the military. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley to advise on how to deal with the monsters, but quickly becomes indispensable to the army that is sent in to deal with the creatures. Large amounts of firepower are released, but casualties are high and the mission quickly becomes an escape attempt. Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen, two of the most underrated action stars around, add a good deal to the film along the way. There are massive numbers of aliens in this sequel, in contrast to the single deadly killer of film one. A longer film than Alien, it nevertheless doesn't waste a second and the Director's Cut has some nice added scenes as well. The conclusion is brilliant, Sigourney going all guns blazing to rescue the kid from the clutches of the queen alien! Cue loads of machine gun action!

","You have to know about me that I'm a big movie buff, but that I'm not a fan of most Sci-Fi movies. It's just not my kind of movie. Most of the time they just aren't good enough and aren't able to make me believe the story. But the Alien-movies are something different. Somehow they are able to get my attention and to keep me focused from the beginning until the end.<br/><br/>Aliens is the second movie in the series and the story starts half a century later. Ripley, the only survivor from the previous movie, has been found by a salvage ship, adrift in the shuttle she used to escape, in a deep sleep. She's taken back to Earth, where she hears that a colony was established on the planet where the Alien once was found. But since a while, all contact with the planet has been lost and a rescue mission, coordinated by the Space Marines, will be sent to see what has happened. Ripley is asked to join them as their 'advisor' and so she will meet her biggest fear ... again.<br/><br/>Even though it is still my opinion that sequels should be forbidden, since most of them are only intended to get even more money out of the pockets of the fans, I'll have to review my opinion for once. This movie certainly isn't as bad as most sequels are. It's still full of action, the acting is good and let's be honest, a Sci-Fi movie that doesn't look dated after 20 years time is something special. That's why I give this one a 7/10. Certainly worth a watch"

","I have only seen the first two of the ""Alien"" series, so my comments on both films are within this context. Despite being a sequel with a time gap that cannot be considered wide (1979 to 1986), I found the two films quite different in both style and essence: Whereas Ridley Scott in ""Alien"" made a typical thriller, James Cameron came up with a movie in which the focus was much more on the action and less on suspense.<br/><br/>In ""Alien"", we saw one by one the crew members of Nostromo getting killed by the mysterious and cryptic alien in a slow and painful pace (until the last scenes at least, where the tempo goes up). In ""Aliens"", the theme is completely different: Ripley (Weaver) is persuaded to return to the planet, which has been colonized by humans who are unaware of the lethal danger, and who have now faced the wrath and terrorizing of the aliens who inhabit there. The Company also sends a team of Space Marines with heavy fire power (with Ripley acting as their adviser), in order to clean up the place. As soon as the squad lands onto the unfriendly territory, the action begins: The aliens are tough nuts, and a devastating war between the two species takes place.<br/><br/>Contrary to the first film, ""Aliens"" is full of overwhelming sci-fi action, putting the film in the same category as say, the Star Wars saga (although the scenes in ""Aliens"" are much more brutal and horrific). Moreover, although ""Alien"" was a much more genuine and pioneer film, in ""Aliens"" I didn't get this feeling (although the fact that it was a sequel is in part responsible for this).<br/><br/>This does not mean that ""Aliens"" is not good. On the contrary, it provides us with vivid action, solid performances, stunning effects (for the 80's standards), and a very good direction. Yet, I can't help but give it a slightly lower grade than the superb ""Alien"". Overall mark 7/10."

"ed_metal_head","7","0","1","20 January 2005"," A Good Action Packed Sequel.
","James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is the sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 film ""Alien"". In that film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the sole survivor of her spaceship's crew that was decimated by an alien. This film focuses on Ripley and her return to the planet from ""Alien"" where the alien eggs are located.<br/><br/>After finally being found by The Company after floating aimlessly in space for many years, Ripley is horrified to discover that the planet from ""Alien"" has been colonised by humans (who have no clue that they share the planet with alien eggs). When The Company loses contact with the planet, they send a representative (Paul Reiser), a team of marines and Ripley to investigate. Upon their arrival, they find a terrified girl called ""Newt"" (Carrie Henn) who tells them what happened to the rest of the colony (see the title of the film).<br/><br/>While not quite as good as the first film, ""Aliens"" still has a very satisfying plot. Whereas ""Alien"" focused on suspense, ""Aliens"" is an action movie. Moreover, as far as action movies go, this film will surely be rated highly among them if the audience buys the story. Here lies the problem with the plot: that it may not be entirely believable to all viewers. For instance, Ripley and Newt develop a sort of mother-daughter relationship that explains a critical decision taken towards the film's end. Those who do not believe the bonding was strong enough (myself included) will think the decision is ridiculous. Further, the plot does not properly explain why Ripley would ever want to go back to the alien planet. We know that the alien's image still haunts her dreams and for her to be rid of it she must see them eliminated, but is this really a sufficient reason? With those exceptions, the plot is still good and action-filled. Thankfully, as in the first film, there is a long period to build the story and characters before anything takes place.<br/><br/>If one finds the Ripley/Newt relationship believable then Sigourney Weaver's performance is good, otherwise, it is ordinary, noted only for her strong female role. Paul Reiser and Michael Biehn can be enjoyable at times, but they do not have the skills to demonstrate the few complexities of their characters. Ms. Henn seems quite an annoying child actor whose job is to get into trouble. The most enjoyable performance comes from the foul-mouthed tough-guy, Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) who quickly turns into a frightened wimp after an alien encounter. Lance Henriksen also does a solid job as the android, Bishop.<br/><br/>James Cameron's direction is this film's highlight. Cameron obviously seems to have a knack for the science-fiction/action genre as he demonstrated in The Terminator (also starring Biehn). If there is one flaw, it is his overuse of hordes of aliens, which takes away the mystique the alien had in the first film and makes the creatures seem more vulnerable.<br/><br/>Visually the film looks decent. There are still tight claustrophobic sets and dark lighting that add to the feel of the film. The models used are not as convincing however, so that the first film that was released seven years earlier actually looks better.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Aliens"" is a good action movie and a good sequel that can actually be enjoyed without seeing the original film. Actually, viewers who have not yet seen the brilliant ""Alien"" may enjoy this film more if they see it first."
"pwoods1","9","0","1","8 December 2004"," A Better Sequel
","Alien was amazing. The ambiance was incredible. The sets, the atmosphere (pun intended) created a perceived situation wherein Ripley became a disposable asset - and, of course, a means to an end. The notion that any person/worker/drone/android? can be used and abused by a multinational corporation is, of course, central to the Alien sequence. <br/><br/>So. ""Aliens"". The humanity which was lacking in the first film comes to prominence in the second. Ripley has developed into a character clearly in need of a personal relationship - one outside her cat and/or the destructive and impersonal contingency imposed by the Corporation and its cynical and destructive use of all its employees and androids. She finds it, of course, in her fierce protection of an orphaned child. In the denouement, Supermom attacks the Bitch Queen, the rapacious hive/brood mother for whom all other living creatures are repositories for her young and ultimately (possibly) food. But, at the same time, Ripley becomes a trope for humanity's OWN unstoppable maternal/protective instinct and thus survival. The roles of Ripley and the Alien Queen become 'two sides of the same coin': different and yet part of the same whole; the same drive toward survival of species. <br/><br/>Isn't it wonderful to write in hindsight? Ripley's own humanity becomes questionable in later episodes, particularly in number four (I'm not over-happy with 3, but 4, as lame as it is sometimes, has some wonderful sub-plots and conceits). However, that is for another review! Suffice to say that ""Aliens"" is one of those rare creatures: a sequel which improves on the original and adds to it, at the least, on a plot and audience-satisfaction level. A deserved rating of CLASSIC!"
"Aztec_Camera1","9","0","2","5 November 2004"," Is the 1st one REALLY better?
","This movie is one of those that stands out even today. Not because of a couple of memorable taglines, but because Cameron shows us here that he can even make material that may have been skewered by a different director, seem raw and adventurous. With stand-out performances by an excellent cast, and production values off the scale, this film, in my opinion easily outshines the 1st. Alien had an amazing level of intensity, with almost a noirish feel to it. And lets not forget that Alien will always be ""the 1st one, and it's a title well deserved. But for sheer thrills and some incredible movie making this one goes down as an all-time Top 10 pick for me. I can watch this one just about any time and be treated to something that feels like the 1st time, every time."

","Aliens is as good if not better than Alien. It is the rare type of movie than can be viewed multiple times. Between its release in 1986 and now, I must have seen it 20 times. Unlike the recent AVP film, James Cameron gives us developed characters that we care about instead of just alien fodder. Even the soundtrack stands the test of time as it doesn't sound dated because of heavy synthesizers use like other films from this time period. The makers of this film pretty much got everything right. If I were going to point out a negative it would be with the DVD releases and not the movie its self since there is a good amount of grain visible in darker scene although on the commentary track James Cameron states that problem was caused inherently by the film stock he opted to use since I believe he said at the time 35 was not viable All in all a great film that has me awaiting James Cameron's next Sci-Fi endeavor."

","Aliens, James Cameron's 1986 sequel to Alien;is one of the few sequels in film history which improves upon its predecessor.Whereas the 1979 original focused on a tense suspense driven approach to horror, Aliens is structured as a war film in space. Still providing horror but now mixed with action; Aliens would be the ideal young, testosterone driven, macho male film if not for its leading character being Ripley (the sole human survivor of the original), a woman who learns to hold her own amongst all the bravado of the colonial marines. I remember renting this film frequently from my local video shop in the late eighties, it really stands well to repeat viewing given the amount of quotable lines it features. It's such a shame that the two sequels never once revisited the quality of either this or the afore-mentioned Alien."

","James Cameron took the bear bones of the original Alien (claustraphobia, fear, corporate greed and that legendary creature) and injected the entire package with amphetamines in order to create 'Aliens'.<br/><br/>The film takes a similar structure to the original, with the entire first act being made up almost entirely of 'build-up', apart from a few gory nightmares to please the horror fans. In the special edition the tension is heightened by revisiting the planet from the original and seeing it colonized by naive humans.<br/><br/>When the touch paper is lit, however, 'ALiens' really comes into its own. THe action is frenetic and violent, the creatures savagery unmatched, and the situation dire, to say the least. These humans get basically butt raped by the xenomorphs and are forced into a game of survival.<br/><br/>The grunts vs. corporation power vs. unseen enemy gives the whole film an air similar to Vietnam movies, the special creature effects are stunning and the special effects have stood up to the test of time well. Stylisitically it could all be set in the same cinematic world as CAmeron's 'The Terminator' such is the director's consistency.<br/><br/>The Alien Queen is, to put it bluntly Sh*t Hot! This is by far and away what everyone wanted to see from a sequel; bigger, badder and better. <br/><br/>Don't forget thought that it is a re-invention of the franchise and a totally different type of film; but if we're all being honest then Aliens takes the original by the head and punches an extendable jaw right through its face!"

The film takes a bit of time to develop the story, with Ellen Ripley going back to the planet from the first film to help save colonists and battle the Aliens, but this time accompanied by some real firepower and a small army of Marines. The development shouldn't be viewed as boring or slow, and besides introducing an interesting scenario, it's the calm before the storm, and what a storm!

","My Rating: **** out of ****. <br/><br/>If I was asked to say which is the better director: James Cameron or Ridley Scott, I would have to think about that. If I had to say which was the better movies: Scott's Alien or Cameron's Aliens, the answer would be Aliens. This film represents the ultimate high point in Cameron's career. It ranks as one of the best, if not the best sci/fi-action film. As good as Camerons other films are: Terminator, Terminator 2, and True Lies, Aliens is better. <br/><br/>Alien was mainly a horror film set in space, a very good and effetive one at that. Aliens has some scenes that are horror-like but it mostly uses suspenseful action in its place. There are so many suspenseful action sequences that its almost impossible to name them all. The film is set at a very effective pace so the viewer may never become bored.<br/><br/>
The cast is very well chosen. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ripley and I believe she is better here than in Alien. Shes much more tougher and is one of the best action heroes in a film. The supporting cast gives solid support. Bill Paxton is excellent as Hudson, he has some excellent one-liners. Michael Biehn (who was in The Terminator) gives a solid performance as Hicks. Jeanette Goldstein is also solid as Vasquez. Paul Reiser is very detestable as Burke. The rest of the cast is also noteworthy too. <br/><br/>One of Alien's weakness's was our ability, or atleast mine, to care for some of the characters. This weakness is not present in Aliens. The characters are not complex but they are very likable here (except for one). The dialogue is very well written and the story is well constructed.<br/><br/>
Aliens mostly still looks great in the technical categories. The visual effects hold up well. The sets are excellent. The creatures are absolutely terrifying, especially the Queen Alien. Like Alien, Aliens also has atmosphere throughout. <br/><br/>Cameron has created a sequel that is better than the original but this is not the first time he has done this. Terminator 2 was significantly better than the first. As memorable as Alien was, Aliens is better and ranks higher on my personal favorites list. Cameron may still have other good films in him, but I dont think he will beat this."

","""Aliens"" is the second of four alien films starring Sigourney Weaver as Ripley. James Cameron takes over from Ridley Scott as the director for this installment.<br/><br/> The story picks up where the original left off when Ripley's shuttle craft is found by a salvage ship. When she comes around she discovers that it is now 57 years later and of course no one believes her story. She also finds out from ""Company"" man Burke (Paul Reiser) that the planet upon which the first alien was discovered, is now inhabited. Then it is discovered that all communications has ceased from that planet.<br/><br/> So Burke convinces Ripley to accompany him and a platoon of crack marines, as a consultant to go back to the planet to see what has happened. The marines are led by a green lieutenant (William Hope) and include a tough sergeant (Al Mathews), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), a tough female, Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) and a nervous Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton). An android called Bishop (Lance Hendricksen) is also along. <br/><br/> They arrive at the station on the planet and find the it is deserted...except for a frightened little girl called ""Newt"" (Carrie Henn). Ripley manages to gain the girl's confidence and becomes her protector. She also discovers that Burke has his own agenda.<br/><br/> The marines find the alien nest while on a reconnaissance mission. The aliens attack and several marines are killed. The survivors retreat back into the station and prepare for the ultimate invasion.<br/><br/> James Cameron wisely decided not to duplicate the first film which was essentially a claustrophobic horror film. This film has more gadgets, more action and more bodies. The special effects are quite convincing and the battles with the monsters are very exciting. <br/><br/> The character of Ripley if you can believe it goes from a frightened civilian to a female Arnold Schwarzeneggar virtually overnight and acquires an instant expertise in the weaponry as well. While that's a little hard to believe, the action sequences are quite well done especially the final battles.<br/><br/> Not quite up to the level of the first film but an exciting action film nonetheless."
"Cephyran","9","0","2","6 September 2003"," Superior sequel...
","There was a time when scary movies were actually scary, and you weren't just jumping at a music sting. There was a time when special effects were believable because they were real, tangibly there. There was a time when scripts still had shreds of originality in them. The late 70's and early 80's were that time, and quite fortunately, out of this era came James Cameron's top-notch works. <br/><br/>Aliens has a timelessness to it, and it's a composite of so many different elements. This was a generation of filmmakers who didn't have the luxury of a computer in the next room that could spit out 3D renderings of anything they could think up. People had to imagine, sculptors had to physically build, and engineers had to make machines that actually worked. This is the first reason Aliens is far superior to any modern films of the genre. The weapons aren't just props with digital gunfire added in - they're working machines spitting bright white flares of blank powder. The power loaders are fully operational hardware that had to be built. And the aliens themselves were real - costumes, puppets, they were real. Believability doesn't just reach between the viewer and the characters on-screen; it has to fall between the on-screen characters as well. When a stunt man in an alien costume leaps at the lead actor, that actor knows how to react, how to grasp or flail and can actually ACT the reaction. We lose this with all the modern movies so over-saturated with special effects that we wonder why the film wasn't done all CG to begin with. <br/><br/>Ellen Ripley - Sigourney Weaver - was one of the first female action heroes the people of my generation would recognize. In a genre dominated by Schwarzenegger and Stallone, we suddenly had this strong brazen woman, and frankly a damn good actor, taking the lead. And Aliens characterizes her leadership in a very effective way. The marines think they're invincible. Once they've learned they hard way that they're dealing with a dangerous force, only then does Ripley's opinion really become respected. <br/><br/>The music. One of my core theories is that a science fiction movie's effectiveness is driven half by the music. In Aliens we have James Horner creating this intricate and unparalleled spectrum of sound. And while he admits to scavenging his own score from a Star Trek score, he still does amazing things with it, specifically in a minimalist way. James Horner knew that music can sway the emotion of a scene, and he knew exactly how to use it to evoke the terror aspect of the aliens. A long delicate ambiance is suddenly torn by a sting from the string section, a dissonance of notes that is has such simple perfection it could only forever be recognizable as his 'Woah!' sound. <br/><br/>And special effects. The Aliens were real, be they costumes or puppets or just a head on a hydraulic for the second jaw to spring out. Visually, the Giger-inspired creatures are truly unique and forever etched in pop culture's mind as one of the most effectively scary monsters. In the 80's, James Cameron knew exactly how to use his special effects to maximum effectiveness, and it shows in all his films from that decade. Were he try to make the same film today, the effect simply would not be the same. We've become so desensitized to special effects that while the older cinema-geeks like myself would relish the idea of costumes and props for monsters, the younger generation would immediately point and laugh at how 'fake looking' the monsters are. Incidentally, CG isn't immune to this either, and the assorted sequels and crossover films have only served to punctuate that. <br/><br/>In summary: Aliens is one of the best science fiction films of all time, I am comfortable with saying. If you have not seen it - the full director's cut - you owe it to yourself to go and do so."

"alainenglish","Null","0","2","27 May 2003"," Excellent sequel surpasses original (spoilers)
","""Aliens"" is an excellent sequel to ""Alien"", surpassing it both in action and characterisation.  Director James Cameron has oomphed up the ante in thrills, scares and action but has not forgotten to create a cast of likeable (and not so likeable) individuals to whom the audience can relate.<br/><br/>It is nearly 57 years after Ripley (again played by Sigourney Weaver) destroyed the creature (along with her ship) in the first film.  She's found floating in her escape ship, along with Jones the cat.  To her horror she discovers the planet where her ill-fated crew found the alien has been colonised.  When contact with the colony is mysteriously lost, she's talked into going back with a squad of trigger happy marines to investigate.  They find one survivor, a frightened ten-year old child Newt (Carrie Henn), and not one alien creature but a whole nest of them....<br/><br/>The plot and pacing of the film is easily the best of the series.  The buildup, while not as relaxed as that of ""Alien"", is done very well and Cameron does well to increase the horror before unleashing the aliens full-tilt.  The plot further successfully expands on the themes of the original, with the aliens creating their hive within the colony complex and using the inhabitants as hosts for future spawn (something hinted at in deleted scenes in the first film).  The story has an interesting Vietnam War parallel (affirmed by Cameron in an interview) with the indigenous aliens (the Vietcong) utterly confounding the technology and weaponry of the Marines (US military).  More relevant today is the suggestion (through the character of Paul Reiser's Burke) of the extreme moral corruption and exploitation that can occur whenever big business intertwines with politics.<br/><br/>
The script is also much better this time around, giving us a gallery of distinctive but plausible characters who learn and develop throughout the course of the film.  This is enhanced by some very accomplished acting.  It is fascinating to watch Bill Paxton's initially gung-ho, macho Hudson descend into crazed hysteria when confronted with the invincibility of his foe. Michael Biehn successfully repeats his romantic lead from ""The Terminator"", even if the chemistry between him and Weaver isn't quite as potent as it could be.  Carrie Henn is gentle but intelligent as Newt, and Lance Henrikson is quietly convincing as sympathetic android Bishop.<br/><br/>The standout though is Weaver's Ripley.  Fully developed from the mere cypher she was in the first film, she comes through here as being the only one able to intelligently and assertively assess the gravitas of her situation.  She also forms a empathic motherly bond with the like-minded Newt.  Weaver excels in conveying all of these emotions, and the final rescue and fight for her surrogate daughter is all the better because of it.<br/><br/>Cameron's work on the technical side of film is always superlative and this movie is no exception.  There are some well-edited fight sequences between the marines and the aliens, packed with impressive special effects.  The concluding showdown between Ripley and the Alien Queen is a winner.<br/><br/>""Aliens"", in the wake of its success, would give way to a strong but deeply flawed third movie and a decidedly unmemorable fourth movie.  But this first sequel was and remains the definitive entry in the series."

","Sequels are rarely as successful as originals. Exceptions: Star Wars, Indiana Jones or Alien. Alien was a terrific movie, it marked a new way of making sci-fi movies. It mixed horror and science fiction perfectly well. The sequel to Alien, Aliens, directed by James Cameron, is a great achievement too. Aliens is one of the top action films ever made. It shows how brilliant director James Cameron is, a long time before Titanic. The original Alien was particularly suspenseful. I believe the sequel has other qualities. It is terrific also. But Aliens is above all a wonderfully well-made movie, with great rhythm and non-stop action that is really impressive. Along with spectacular scenes is Sigourney Weaver, really wonderful in the part that made her famous. James Cameron wrote a beautiful part for her, and she finally gave a memorable performance, proving that women can play tough parts. In Aliens, I also liked the performance by Lance Henriksen, a good actor who has often had supporting roles. Here, he acts the android Bishop perfectly well. Aliens, the second installment in the Alien saga, is my favourite and I strongly recommend it to everyone who want to have more than two hours of great entertainment."

I recall clearly opening night, the entire theater rose as one at the conclusion to the pic and clapped, stamped and whistled. Warren Beatty can only dream of such a reaction!<br/><br/>Part of its success I feel, comes from the inspired multi-floor   postering at the time (at least in Australia), showing Ripley armed to the teeth, looking skywards with the catch line ""There are some places in the Universe you don't go!"" ""Exciting"" doesn't adequately describe this unremittingly supercharged sequel. It delivered!<br/><br/>A key common to most engrossing films are interesting characterizations and this flick has them in abundunce.  Ripley - at the top of her tree, Corporal Hicks, Vasquez, Hudson and even Newt, a winner all the way. The aliens themselves were realistic to the point of disbelief, both in appearance and movement. Even in ALIEN the concluding shot of the beast being blown out of the airlock looked suspiciously like a man in a suit which the remainder of the film had avoided. In ALIENS there is no trace of human involvement.<br/><br/>
Packed with smart-ass repartee and memorable one-liners, ""Well why don't you put HER in charge?"" asks Hudson (Paxton) referring to young Newt the only survivor of the colony, after Ripley praises her survival techniques. Predictably, the most famous line of all is left to Ripley, ""Get away from her..you BITCH!"" as she prepares to do battle with the Queen alien at the climax of the movie.<br/><br/>Adrenalin charged action from the opening scene, it'll be a while until anyone sees this again!<br/><br/>The special effects were in a class of their own - one has only to watch ALIEN RESURRECTION to realise how true this is.

"fliper78617","10","0","2","23 April 2003"," The best out of the saga
","Sometimes in movies sequels are made they end up being the same, the worst or the best. Aliens fits in the better than 1st one category. It's sometimes rare that a sequel surpasses the original mainly because of different writers, directors or lack of creativity. However Director and writer James Cameron knew firsthand of what to do and delivered what the audience wanted a fierce action film but with fear and darkness along with it that made it a truely aspiring film. Cameron earlier directed The Terminator a well done film in 1984 that promoted him as an excellent director and now he directs a film that is proberly his 2nd best. The story (Also written by Cameron) takes place 57 years later when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is picked up by a salvage team and lets her know what has happened during her long hypersleep. As the film progresses there have been terraforming factories on the planet that Ripley explored many years earlier that are trying to establish a colony but in reality are working for the company to try and get mysterious aliens. Later on Earth has lost contact with the colonists and decide to send marines in to found out why. A company associate by the name of Burke (Paul Reiser) try's to convince Ripley of going with the Marines to advise them of what these creatures are capable of. After all the bad dreams Ripley has been having she finally agrees to join them. The film progresses on meeting many tough marines introducing them like the respectful Hicks (Michael Biehn), the tough Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein) and my personal favorite the complaining showoff Hudson (Bill Paxton. As they land they discover weird, unusual and mysterious things. However a little girl by the name of Newt (Carrie Henn) is the only survivor and already knows what's happened to the colonists and to her family. As they enter the main complex they discover they have to fight the aliens as well before they become hosts to make more aliens. Once again its up to Ripley to help the marines and later to battle the Queen Alien from laying more eggs again. The performances are the best, Sigourney Weaver gives is what proberly her best performance of her life and is much convincing in this role of Ripley than she was in Alien. I especially like it when she establishes the relationship with Newt since they're both alone and are full of emotion it generally makes you care about them a lot. Michael Biehn gives a great performance as Corporal Hicks, Bill Paxton is a hoot to watch a great one liner ""This ain't happening man"", ""This ain't happening"". Other performances are great including Reiser's performance as Burke, Goldstein as (Vasquez) and a great one to watch Lance Henriksen as Bishop as a synthetic android who's highly intelligent. The Special Effects are still the best and convincing done by Stan Winston who always creates the best Special Effects in makeup especially the slime, Alien warriors, The Face huggers (They diffentely make me jump still to this day and i meant to say just plain face hugger in Alien, but they're still born of a queen). Anyway everything about this film is spectacular Directing, Writing, Production, Music by James Horner is creepy at times and one of his best (Also i should have said Jerry Goldsmith delivered a fine score too) and the acting as well. Only made for 18.5 million dollars proves to me that James Cameron could make any kind of spectacular film out of money and he did. Also get the Special Edition that runs 154mins it makes the film a little bit easier to understand and its more emotional.<br/><br/>Regular Scale- 5/5: 1-10 Scale- 10/10"

","So here we have the adrenalized version of Alien: it's a high-paced war-movie.  The cautious civillian characters are simply replaced by macho soldiers.<br/><br/>  One of the best sequels ever, yet not surpassing Alien in many ways. First the cast is not brilliant: it's made great by the cinematography, the editing and mainly the directing, which has become something of a trademark of Cameron.  Secondly, some key elements of the first film are copied (except the intellect), e.g. the entrepreneurial dilemma.  That does not mean that the rest of the plot isn't fantastic: the story builds up gradually and explodes even further than Alien (including plot-twists). Third, the aesthetics are gone.  All the subtle details from Alien are replaced by funky eye-catchers.  But then again that doesn't diminish the reality of what's going on.  It does explain why Aliens has more votes than Alien though.<br/><br/>  Finally, Aliens keeps up with the times and is definitely one of the 10 best SF-movies ever made.  As far as I'm concerned this still surpasses every Star Wars episode there is: this is not just greasy kid-stuff!  Did you know that the aliens are actually crossbreedings of the Terminator and E.T., as is Johnny Five (Short Circuit, 1986) ?

","James Cameron took the continuing story of Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in a different direction than the first installment.

Ripley, along with a troop of Colonial marines, are not faced with a single alien(which almost killed everyone in the first film), but a hive of them.    The two films marry together quite nicely.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","0","3","22 April 2001"," One of the best sci-fi films ever.
","When a sequel is so many times better than the original, it's hard to believe that the first was so exciting and pioneering. James Cameron, fresh from his groundbreaking Terminator, proves he was no one-hit wonder by maintaining the perfect balance of action, suspense and sub-text.<br/><br/>Fifty seven years after a lone Xenomorph killed everyone on the Nostromo, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) awakes in a space station orbiting earth. Happy news does not greet her. Her only child has died an old lady and she has no life left to get back to. Plus, she is having disturbing nightmares and is facing charges of willful destruction of private property, which seems ludicrous when you consider that she destroyed the Nostromo before any of the ""suits"" were born.<br/><br/>Back on LV426, a family has stumbled upon the same mysterious spacecraft that John Hurt ventured into in Alien. And sure as sugar, the dad doesn't leave until a face-hugger is, well...hugging his face. Before you know it, the Company - actually called Weyland-Yutani - has lost contact with the entire colony on LV426 and Ripley is enrolled to help a bunch of Marines deal with the problem.<br/><br/>Many Vietnam subtexts are played out as well as a more gentle subplot, in which Ripley becomes a surrogate mother to Newt (Carrie Henn), an orphaned child, who has more guts and initiative than the entire platoon put together. Bill Paxton plays Hudson, the wimpiest but most likable Marine ever in movies. Lance Henriksen is Bishop, an android who tries to convince Ripley that he is not like the deceitful and perverted Ian Holm from the original. Michael Biehn is Hicks the reluctant corporal who takes charge of the futile mission after the first, scarifying attack by the Xenomorph.<br/><br/>Cameron assaults us with so many shocks and stingers and keeps us on the edge of our seats for well over two hours. At one point Hudson says, ""They're comin' outta the goddamn walls""- you better believe it! We never know where, or when, another alien will strike from the damp darkness and drag away a hapless Marine. And you can't shoot these monsters close-up because they'll spray acid blood all over you.<br/><br/>Backing up the claustrophobic, nerve-wracking mayhem is James Horner's Academy Award nominated score, which is haunting and cold and thundering and bombastic. This is definitely not a film for the nervous, or those with a pacemaker. Rapid fire editing, tense close-ups and an extremely oppressive atmosphere, reeking of death, take over the movie.<br/><br/>The final showdown with the massive, no-nonsense - but still quite feminine - Alien Queen is one of the best ever filmed. To think that Ridley Scott provoked so much tension and dread from just one is strange. When they are all over you, it makes for a superior sequel.<br/><br/>The Director's Cut of Aliens is now considered the official one and is the only version you will find out there.<br/><br/>If the movie doesn't scare you, Weaver's Afro will."

","The BEST movie I have ever seen, and the best sequel to any movie. Usually sequels become truly awful, dare I mention Speed 2: Cruise Control, but Cameron really knows how to make them clinch, T2 fx. In spite of the original ALIEN movie, ALIENS is an action and sci-fi adventure movie. Not that i mind at all...I think that ALIEN becomes boring at some points, very exiting at other, well ALIEN is also a great movie. But ALIENS certainly does not become boring, because this movie simply is the best. Just yesterday I discovered two new things, that I hadn´t seen before, it´s the small details that makes this movie good, and all the other stuff also, of course.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10, and I must say that it´s very rare that I give 10 stars, but this one deserves it."
"Chill-27","9","0","2","22 November 2000"," Clearly the best of the series
","What could one expect after Ridley Scott's wonderful original film? Well, at least I got exactly what I wished for in the sequel by James Cameron. Aliens is a different film than its predecessor : the original was a stylish, groundbreaking horror film, and Aliens is more of a slam-bang spectacle - delivering thrills, chills and more.<br/><br/>Cameron builds the tension excellently, using all the necessary elements from the prequel. He gives Ripley's character more depth, particularly in the special edition of this film. Cameron introduces us to the marines who are sent to a colonized planet - the same one from which the alien in the original film came. These badass soldiers seem to think of themselves as an invincible force... but they're up against something they could never prepare for.<br/><br/>All the actors' performances are fine. Sigorney Weaver is exceptionally believable as Lt.Ellen Ripley. Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, Michael Biehn and especially Bill Paxton do an excellent job in the supporting cast. Cameron's visual style and sense of pace fit perfectly in this world, and the story (written by Cameron) is exciting and surprising.<br/><br/>A definite improvement from the first film, and still the best sequel in this genre. Without this film the Alien-series could have gone in a totally wrong direction from the first sequel. We're lucky it was James Cameron who realised it.<br/><br/>My rating : 9 out of 10"
"NoLegs","10","0","2","1 November 2000"," Simply the best of the series.........
","This movie holds one of the saddest moments in movie history.  Although I have watched it over and over and over again, there is only one real reason that this movie is an all time great, and that my friends is ""The Pax"". That's right, Bill Paxton made this movie and when he dies, it isn't even worth watching anymore, I usually turn it off right when he dies, but sometimes I wait to watch Paul Reiser die, because he is the devil.  Long Live Bill Paxton Sarcasm!"
"Aidan McGuinness","10","0","1","21 August 2000"," Excellent in every regard - a superior sequel
","Aliens ranks as my favourite science fiction movie, and perhaps my favourite movie, of all time. It manages to get all the correct elements as far as I'm concerned, and still enthralls me after the umpteenth viewing due to success in many areas :<br/><br/>Characters - All of the characters stand out and are memorable. I have no problem distinguishing my Vasquez from my Gorman. Too many formulaic Hollywood movies today create forgettable cardboard people to populate their worlds - and science fiction is often one of the worst genre offenders. Ripley herself is now almost the archetype for the Female Action Hero, and is drawn well. The cast around her - Newt, Hicks, Bishop, Hudson et. al. are drawn just the correct amount for the movie to make you care about them.<br/><br/>Action - No-one can fault the movie on action. It's got your fix of blazing guns and explosions, as well as the final fight with the protagonist in the closing reels, interspersed with a decent amount of quiescent scenes to calm us down.<br/><br/>Atmosphere - Is where the film starts to take real credit. Taking Ridley Scott's vision of the future, it works with and creates the dank, went, dirty feel. This helps compound the tension caused by the aliens as they skulk around - I know of no other science fiction movie that creates as much tensive mood as this piece.<br/><br/>There are an equal other number of areas the film scores in - music, story, etc. It's ability to do each so well marks it far above the heads of nearly every other science fiction movie with only a few movies able to even remotely compete in it's league (namely, in my opinion, The Terminator, 12 Monkeys and The Matrix).<br/><br/>If you have somehow missed this seminal gem of the science fiction genre, than I urge you to rent it out as soon as possible."

","I think that ALIENS is the best in the series, followed but the 1st & 4th in close 2nd. The cast does a great job. I just wanted 2 smack P. Reiser 4 what he does in this movie. I never liked him after I saw this movie. The alien effects r again excellent. This is Cameron's 2nd best movie only behind T2:Judgement Day, which is his best. Don't mess with Ripley, she can kick your alien a$$. This is a must have, especially on DVD."
"Rampaging Hulk","10","0","1","9 March 2000"," My favorite film of all time
","I remember first seeing this masterpiece when I was about 9. 10 years later it remains the best movie I've ever seen. In true James Cameron style, it is an action movie with much, much more than action. The characters are all well defined, and in the first 15 minutes there have already been many internal conflicts established. It is not just marines vs aliens. H.R. Geiger's aliens are absolutely excellent, and despite the revolution in CGI SFX, they still don't look dated at all. This dark movie has a malevolent and brooding atmosphere which is maintained throughout the film, by brilliant direction on the part of Jim Cameron, and excellent acting by all involved, especially Bill Paxton as Hudson, who remains my favorite screen character of all time. It is such a pity that the next two films in the saga were so bad, and that they don't make action movies like this anymore."
"dr.gonzo-4","Null","0","1","1 March 2000"," ..one of the most forgotten and under-rated sequels of all time
","This film happens to be one of the most forgotten and under-rated sequels of all time. For one simple reason: it totally diverges from the original. ALIEN was a sci-fi/horror film and ALIENS is a sci-fi/action film. In the first outing, you have a serial-killer type of alien that plucks off the crew members one by one and it is up to the feminist heroine Ripley to save herself and a stupid cat. Very predictable. In ALIENS, you have a whole mess of these aliens and they are thirsty for human blood, but who are their victims? Not some pathetic spaceship crew, the marines! They are here for one reason, to kick ass and take names. Their philosophy is simple: we may die, but if we do we are gonna take out as many of these creatures as we can. Where the original succeeded in its basic horror elements, the second one succeeds through taking these elements and adding to them nonstop battle and action sequences. What would you rather use to battle an alien? Your wits or a flame thrower duck taped to a machine gun/grenade launcher? Hmm, tough choice. Also I might add that throughout the film I had no idea who was going to die and who would survive till the end. In the future, Ridley Scott should stick to hardcore drama pieces like WHITE SQUALL and GI JANE. His sci-fi technique is just too slow and drawn out. With that, I think James Cameron should definitely make more films like this one and THE ABYSS, THE TERMINATOR 2, etc. He happens to be the only director that is responsible for two of the greatest sequels of all time! But of course let's not forget, we should give some credit to THE GODFATHER PT2 and THE ROAD WARRIOR."
"cmacdonald","10","0","2","25 February 2000"," Everything we loved about the original, multiplied by 1,000!!!
","An adrenaline rush from start to finish!  More xenomorphs, more firepower, more Ripley, more chest-bursting-flamethrowing-heartpounding-action, why oh why couldn't the following two films have done the same?  The many sub-plots and relationships between characters, Ripley & Burke, Ripley & Hicks, Ripley & Bishop, the colonists, Gorman and Vasquez etc.. were all interwoven perfectly and dissolved at the right moments when surviving the terror became of paramount importance!  Scary, exciting, funny, superb plot, guns, violence, human drama, and it expands on the original without taking too much away - everything you want from a sci-fi sequel!!!"
"Indy-52","9","0","2","23 February 2000"," Aliens (1986) D: James Cameron Rating:**1/2
","Action-packed sequel to the 1979 hit ""Älien"" concentrates more on the action than the pure terror in the first one. The story is well thought, picking up right where its predecessor left off. Ripley has been floating around in space for the last 57 years and is now found by one of those guys from the Company. He tells her that the planet where the alien was found has been colonised and that contact was lost. She accepts to go to the planet to be an advisor to the classical bunch of macho marines as how to kill them. It has suspence and thrills going for it, but that sense of fear just isn't there anymore and the action becomes mechanical after a while."
"Corp Hix","10","0","1","24 September 1998"," The best film ever made - a masterpiece
","James Cameron has always been by favourite director, he is a true master of film making.  Aliens was the first Cameron film I saw.  It is a perfect example of how all films should be made.  The direction (Cameron), Music (by James Horner), Special effects (Stan Winston) and acting are all supurb. Every time I watch it my heart gets pumping and the adrenaline takes effect. I will never get bored of this film.  I'm desperately waiting for it to be released on region 1 DVD.  This film is one of the main reasons why I got my DVD player modified to play region 1."
"Koop-4","10","0","2","6 September 1999"," The BEST one in the series!
","Alien whose a great movie. Alien3 was a terrible movie. Alien Resurrection was a fantastic movie. Yet Aliens is still the best of them all. It may have destroyed most of the suspense from the first movie, but it doesn't need it, it's an Action film. The movie is a fabulous feast of music, effects, excitement and even some drama! The scenes with the Queen are fantastic! This movie is a must see for lovers of Sci-Fi and Action films alike. Don't miss this movie!"
"Mike-363","10","0","2","1 September 1999"," A Sequel As Good or Better than the Original
","Aliens is a worthy follow-on to Alien.  I think I enjoyed this one even more.  Being a ex-military type I was impressed with the military gear and weaponry, all of which seemed to be logical improvements over current gear and weapons.  Except the pistols, which looked the same.  Michael Biehn really added to this movie.  The entire cast contributed to this movie. If you liked Alien, you'll like this one.  See it, you won't be sorry."
"The_Man-2","Null","0","1","10 July 1999"," One of the best sci fi films ever...
","Not many sequels can out-do their predecessor. James Cameron excels where so many have fallen short. He did it for Terminator, and now he has done it for Alien. He's provided us with an action packed sequal that will knock you on your ass. The action scenes in this movie are nauseouslly intense. The acting is flawless. Full of big names, who back then were barely heard of. Weaver is back - bringing a great sense action-heroism to Ripely, who in the first film, was a back seat character till the ending. now she is the center of every scene and holds her own with many talented actors. But when i think of Aliens - the first name to come to mind is Bill Paxton. Wow. This guy is a POWERFUL actor. I've never seen someone, who was so barely known at the time, bring so much presence to a movie. Paxton is the emotional driving force of this movie as the cocky marine who goes hysterical after the first attack. and has the best death seen EVER. watch for it. it's the best part of the movie. Michael Behin also turns in a good performance as the cool headed, and laid back Corporal Hicks. The character, other than ripley - you'll be rooting for to survive this film. after terminator this movie should have brought him to super star status. (note paxton and behin have been in a few other films together - navy seals, tombstone, terminator) the story is solid as long as you dont dissect it scene for scene and just take it as it is. all in all 10/10. if you love scary movies with intense action scenes and great acting - go for it."
"brijess-2","9","0","1","7 July 1999"," Thrilling!
","Aliens is one of the most thrilling movies ever made. While it is scarier than other thrill films (Indiana Jones, The Mummy, etc) it balances well with the humor and dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>The actual aliens were a little different looking than in the original movie, but they were still a frightening sight!<br/><br/>The drama was intense and the special effects were excellent. And holding this all together is Sigourney Weaver, who, in my opinion, was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar that year. 'Nuff said!<br/><br/>While I enjoy watching the other 2 sequels that followed, I couldn't help but feel disappointed in them, because this movie had a more ""human"" quality to it, rather than set an alien or aliens loose and watch them escape! I don't think they will be able to top this one.<br/><br/>I give this film an A."
"Rob Paul","Null","0","1","2 July 1999"," Cameron's finest hour
","There must have been a huge amount of pressure on Cameron's shoulders to produce a follow-up movie that could approach the masterpiece that was the Terminator. However, Cameron surpasses this film with what I still consider his finest work. He is one of the few director's who really knows how to build up tension, and with Aliens, even on repeated viewings, he cranks the tension up so high that it is truly a frightening movie.<br/><br/>How Sigourney didn't win an Oscar I'll never know. As for Hudson (Bill Paxton) this is probably Paxton's greatest role, just shading his performance in True Lies.<br/><br/>10/10"
"mantrid","10","0","2","29 June 1999"," The best of the Alien Trilogy!
","Out of all of the alien trilogy this film is perhaps the best. It combines the suspense of the original version with some great effects (although not up to the standards in Alien Resurrection).<br/><br/>The plot is actually fairly interesting and has been copied extensively by many newer films- making Aliens seem rather routine.<br/><br/>The characters are fairly good, but do lack background.  The best characters being Cpl. Hicks and Pte. Hudson, played by Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton respectively.  But I didn't like the typical 'child' and 'mad villain' characters, as they were fairly one-dimensional.<br/><br/>The best scenes, in my opinion, include Drake's demise and the landing craft crashing.<br/><br/>It is often argued that Aliens didn't reflect the 'horror' and suspense of the original, but I personally want to see the aliens and lots of carnage, just imagine want kind of film Cameron would have made if he'd had access to todays modern CGI techniques, I know for a fact it would have been great!!!!"
