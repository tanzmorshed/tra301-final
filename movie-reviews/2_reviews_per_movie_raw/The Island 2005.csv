"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","189","248","30 January 2006"," Why were the critics so harsh on the film?
","I thought ""The Island"" was fantastic and just was a movie worth watching. Ewan and Scarlett were just great together in this on the seat thriller, the story was just very exciting. Especially since cloning is such a huge debate right now, I know that it is going to get more intense in the future. That's the story's main plot, cloning and wither it's right or wrong of playing God.<br/><br/>The story itself just keeps you guessing and thinking with some very great effects. I would without a doubt recommend ""The Island"" for your viewing pleasure. It's a lot of fun, it's got excitement, romance, action, and a plot that actually worked coming from Michael Bay. :D My only complaint is the ending, which I choose not to give away, but it leaves some room for questioning. Other than that, enjoy! <br/><br/>9/10"
"qball_82","7","325","449","3 August 2005"," Underrated!
","I found The Island to be highly enjoyable - a great Summer blockbuster that isn't quite mindless. It raises a number of very interesting questions...<br/><br/>Plenty of eye candy in every form, the two leads, the scenery, explosions, action sequences, the cinematography, everything you would expect from Michael Bay and Co. <br/><br/>The pacing to begin with is somewhat slow as the premise is set up (though disappointingly the trailers give it all away), but once it launches into the first action sequence it doesn't let up for some time. Yes the story has a number of plot holes but you can easily overlook them and get swept away in the fun. I've never seen Johansson on film until now and WOW, now I know what all the fuss is about. Her and McGregor display enough chemistry to make their relationship believable but only just. I'm sure this will only propel them onto bigger and better things.<br/><br/>My one and only gripe was with the ending scene complete with cheesy choral accompaniment - blech! Maybe Bay just couldn't help himself. I suppose no film is perfect..<br/><br/>7 out of 10, solid, fun entertainment, what more can you ask for?"

","In 2019, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) are best friends in a repressive and intriguing society, where everybody expects to win the lottery. The prize is to move to a paradisiacal island outside the domes that protect the dwellers against the contaminated environment. Jordan wins the lottery, and Lincoln accidentally finds the scary truth behind the utopist award.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is an original, intriguing and scary view of science, ethic and society in a near future. Using elements of ""Logan's Run"", ""Matrix"", ""Gattaca"" and ""The Thirteenth Floor"", among other sci-fi movies, and non-stop action, it is a surprisingly great film. I liked very much the amoral behavior of Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), with a total lack of ethic, and the possibility of replacement parts raised in the story. Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor shows a good chemistry, and watching this sci-fi / action movie is worthwhile, even to think how cloning process shall be discussed by the society and controlled through well-studied laws. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Ilha"" (""The Island"")"
"MovieManMenzel","7","323","454","24 July 2005"," The Popcorn Action Sci-Fi Thriller for summer 2005
","I worked at Eworks when I first saw the trailer for ""The Island."" I wasn't blown away by the trailer and neither was anyone I worked with, mainly because we couldn't figure out what the hell the movie was about. Several trailers and TV spots later, I still felt the same way about it. The only thing about the film that interested me was the cast. I really like Scarlett Johansson, Ewan McGregor, and Steve Buscemi. So considering that there was nothing else out this weekend I decided to give ""The Island"" a chance.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is basically about the end of the human race or so we think. The movie's basic storyline for the film is this: the human race gets contaminated and there is this compound that rescues people and decontaminates them. So all of the world's survivors live in this compound with the ultimate goal of going to the Island, where everyone can live a safe and happy life. However, Lincoln (Ewan McGregor) finds that this compound doesn't make much sense and begins to question the whole idea of the island. It isn't long before Lincoln finds out the truth behind the island but just when he does his best friend Jordan (Scarlett Johansson) gets selected to go to the island. It is now up to Lincoln to save Jordan and the rest of the people in the compound from going to the island and ultimately finding out the truth of their existence. An intense and action packed film ensues <br/><br/>Like I said earlier this film never really interested me but since this summer is really lacking in films, I gave it a chance and I am glad I did. This movie may actually be Michael Bay's move from all action to action and story. While there are still some plot holes in the film and the script could use a little fixing up, the majority of the film was well done especially for someone like Michael Bay. The story was very interesting and seemed pretty realistic. Sure it had a few far-fetched action scenes but what's a summer action movie without them? But on the whole it was action packed, entertaining, interesting, and thought provoking film(wow who would believe that one day I could say that about a Michael Bay movie).<br/><br/>I also never thought I would see Scarlett Johansson play in a Hollywood action/thriller and from her scenes in the trailer it looked like I never wanted to either. However I was pleasantly surprised by how she pulled it off. She seemed to fit the role and was very good at it. But if you ask me would I rather see her in big budget popcorn flicks or independent films, I would still pick the independent films. Ewan McGregor was actually good as well, and again I never thought I would see him pull off a role like this but I guess that proves that both McGregor and Johansson are good actors. It's was also fun to have Ewan and Scarlett giving the film a few chuckles here and there. Steve Buscemi is our comedic relief guy as well as the guy who basically explains the whole island thing to us. He was good but I felt was cut out of the film awfully fast.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of ""The Island."" It was a lot better then ""War of the Worlds"" which basically had all action and no story. This film doesn't have a perfect story, but it still has one and has an interesting concept at that. This film isn't going to win best picture any time soon but it's a good summer blockbuster. The basic premise of the film to me seems very believable in the near future. I just suggest buying the biggest popcorn and soda at the theater and enjoy! MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Island"" is a 7/10"
"BigHardcoreRed","Null","134","204","4 August 2005"," The Island Is A Mighty Fine Movie.
","The Island is about the possibility, in the not too distant future, of a clone farm, for lack of a better term. When dealing with clones, especially in the movies, problems usually arise due to the lack of knowledge in the area. In this particular movie, it does not give away that they are clones too soon (unless you saw the preview). We are eased into their predicament slowly, although something is quite different and not right. At the beginning, I got sort of a Truman Show kind of feel to the movie, as they are always being watched, either by computers or cameras, and their lives are controlled in just about every detail.<br/><br/>The clones are told that the outer world is contaminated and that the only safe place left is ""the island"". The only way to get to the island is through random lotteries where the lucky winner is whisked away to their new paradise.<br/><br/>Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is the first of the ""harvested beings"", as they put it, to start asking questions and even has distinct memories that were not embedded by the corporation. While wandering around, he soon discovers they have all been lied to. Meanwhile, one of his closest friends, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), has just won the lottery! Just as she is getting ready to leave, Lincoln grabs her away and starts running.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is pretty much a chase scene. One scene in particular closely resembles the one from Bad Boys II. That is not a bad thing, as it was still unique and fun watching the mass destruction.<br/><br/>Both Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson did a fine job in their roles. Somehow, I do not remember Scarlett being as hot as she was in this film but maybe that is just the movie magic. Either way, she has a new fan. Also, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean did fine jobs with their roles. Duncan's role was pretty small but his performance was very strong and relevant to the story.<br/><br/>I was reminded of many movies while watching this one. One scene, while showing the harvesting, was closely resembling The Matrix. Also, one of the reasons I liked this movie so much was the ingenuity involved with inventions of the future. From innovated trains to literal desktop computers (that was awesome) to cars and even to an X-Box, those little things sprinkled all through the movie kept my eyes on the screen. Similar to I, Robot.<br/><br/>Although I would not have considered myself a fan of Michael Bay, after seeing this movie and realizing what other movies he is also responsible for (minus Pearl Harbor), I can say that I like his work and am looking forward to his upcoming Transformers project. 8.5/10"
"kmahaffey","10","155","241","2 December 2006"," Excellent
","I, and also my whole family, found this movie extremely enjoyable and very underrated. I have to admit that I had't even heard of this movie and almost passed it by, as soon as it started, I was glad that I didn't. <br/><br/>Because of the content of a lot of movies (ie. graphic sex and/or violence) it can sometimes be hard to find a movie that the whole family can enjoy without feeling uncomfortable (or falling asleep). I found that ""The Island"" has everything I want in a movie, action, adventure, comedy, and an extremely well written plot line, without an overabundance of sex or violence.<br/><br/>I feel that this movie is well worth watching and highly recommend it."
"mstomaso","7","30","42","20 March 2007"," Just a little better than pretty good, but also just a little unoriginal
","Michael Bay has had his directoral ups and downs, but here in the big budget action realm, the director of the excellent The Rock seems right at home. This time, Bay welds the action to a solid, if somewhat unoriginal sci fi plot - which blends elements of Logan's Run, THX-1138 and Gattaca.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanson are an attractive couple living in a completely medically regulated community designed to repopulate a world decimated by a mass extinction. Ethan Phillips, Djimon Hounsou and Sean Beam all provide excellent support. Beam is miraculously transformed into his clever, arrogant and suspect character. Phillips is also particularly memorable as their slightly unhinged pal.<br/><br/>Life in an enclosed, sterile environment, with all of their needs taken careof - including neatly arranged and identical uniforms, jobs, and three square can be a great bore, so - once a week or so - the sponsoring corporation gives away a one way ticket to the only place in the outside world which isn't lethal - The Island.<br/><br/>McGregor's Licoln Six Echo and a number of his cohorts are becoming increasingly agitated and curious about their home. All the while, his platonic relationship with Jordan Two Delta (Johanson) grows. But then, she wins her ticket to the island.<br/><br/>I have described the basic set up, and sci-fi fans will probably understand that this film actually sits among Logan's Run, gattaca, THX-1138 and other intelligent dystopian sci films. What may be a little harder to visualize is how stylistically indebted to Gattaca and THX-1138 this film is. Ewan McGregor doesn't really look like Ethan Hawke, and Scarlett Johanson is certainly not easily mistaken for Uma Thurmond, but between the cinematography, the themes, and the overall prettiness of the cast, the homage is obvious. The camera work is excellent, and the pace is spot-on, though it does become a little breathless toward the end.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, The Island stands on its own as a nice example of big budget sci fi which does not insult its audience's intelligence and uses its budget to tell an interesting story - not just to show off a lot of special effects and highly improbable action (though there is quite a lot of both here anyway). Recommended for serious and semi-serious sci fi fans."
"tararau","10","174","281","31 July 2005"," loved it
","The Island is the first Michael Bay movie I have seen and I really enjoyed it. Far more entertaining than War Of The Worlds for example, which I found quite boring. <br/><br/>The story is pretty standard issue Sci Fi. Fine by me (I wasn't expecting Bladerunner). It's a story of cloning and bad scientists up to no good. It's a quest movie and a chase movie. It looks fabulous, some nice toys to enjoy. The chase scenes maybe improbable but who cares? It's not Hotel Ruanda (great by the way - love Don Cheedle!!).<br/><br/>You know, I actually found it quite touching and was definitely invested in the well being of the main characters<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is excellent, he is really fun to watch, he takes the movie seriously and it works. He's a really good actor, why haven't I noticed that before? Easy one the eye too which is always good. <br/><br/>Scarlet Johanson is also good, she is lovely to behold and she also turns in a good performance (though never with out lip gloss no matter what) darned makeup people!. <br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou doesn't have as much to do as the above (they are on screen pretty much the whole movie), however,he holds our attention when he is on screen, another fine actor.<br/><br/>If you want some fun, nothing too deep, that looks good and acting that is entirely entertaining. If you enjoy the adrenalin rush of a good chase and some epic destruction (like I do) this is your movie. Go. 10/10 for FUN."

","I have every movies of Michael Bay, and I got to say  this is probably his best. Though the story is nothing new and it has a lots (loads) of resemblances of his previous work; I really enjoy watching it. But it actually the actors (Ewan and Scarlett) who made this movie so interesting.<br/><br/>Without this two actors I don't think I could enjoy it this much. They are perfect with each other (though they're like 10 yrs apart). The story is very believable and it also got great flows; though many parts are just too brief and too many actions scene. I have to warn you  the movie has a lots of gruesome scenes.<br/><br/>Anyway, I like the movie. And I highly recommended for you to watch. Don't trust the US Box Office. As far as I concern it have done really well around the world. This might not be the best sci-fi movie, but it surely keep the audience ask for more pop-corn.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Michael Have Done It Right This Time.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-) Please Rate My Review (Yes or No) After Reading It  Thanks"
"pekjr4","7","146","247","23 July 2005"," A fun ride....
","I liked ""The Island"" quite a bit due for two reasons: a depiction of the future which wasn't too ""over the top"", which was refreshing, coming from Bay, and that the leads were very effective at portraying their characters. McGregor, from his acting, and Johansson, from her open, fresh expression. There could have been a little more exploration of the cloning question, and I felt the action was, while visually beautiful, mundane. The score was outstanding, the theme beautifully matching the opening to the film. Pity there wasn't more of it. Sean Bean, to those used to his villainous work in ""Patriot Games"", and ""Goldeneye"", was a little weak, but due to writing, not his thespian skills. And what's a Micheal Bay or Cohen Brothers movie without Steve Buscemi? His character was relatively weak, with no real motivation behind his actions in the film. Djimon Hounsou has a pretty good part. Nice to see him carry a substantial role. One good reason to see the film: great visuals, good looking people with consistent positive ideals. Pretty to watch."
"DarDarDetroit","7","112","191","19 July 2005"," Good Action Thriller
","I saw the movie at the Detroit red carpet premiere on Monday, July 18. In attendance were Michael Clarke Duncan and Djimon Hounsou.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me very much of Total Recall and The Matrix, not only with the plot line, but with its intensity. This was a very good summer action thriller. It was a little slow at first but once Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson's characters discovered that they were clones, the action picked up immensely.<br/><br/>I was a little surprise about the lack of time Duncan was in the movie. Hounsou did a fabulous job as the hired gun. I am not a Ewan McGregor fan but I think he did a great job as Lincoln Six Echo and Tom Lincoln, especially when both Six Echo and Lincoln were in the same scenes together. Johansson looked good on the screen but her dialogue was limited.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi did an funny job in his supporting role as McCord, the human buddy of Lincoln Six Echo. The scene when Johansson's character, Jordan Two Delta, and McCord go through McCord's closet to find some normal clothes for Johansson is a riot.<br/><br/>As parts of the movie was shot in Detroit (See when Ewan and Scarlett arrive in L.A.), I was looking for shots of the Motor City. In this sense, the movie did an excellent job making Detroit and ""L.A."" look really snazzy. However, in two shots of downtown ""L.A."", you will see on the side of one of the buildings, a giant mural of Stevie Yzerman in his Red and White Red Wings jersey. I don't know if this was a goof, but it was interesting to think of why Yzerman would be on the side of a building in L.A. forty years hence.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a seven. If you are a giant action and science fiction fan, you should not miss The Island."
"terminator690","5","40","65","22 August 2005"," Mediocrity - A lost opportunity
","In Summary: <br/><br/>Appallingly overt product placements. More of a commercial than a movie.<br/><br/>Brilliant premise - but let down by lack of any character or plot development.<br/><br/>The plot is treated purely as a device for standard action scenes - a bit like the plot in a seventies porn movie<br/><br/>Wasted the talents of a fine cast.

"topdogwoof69","1","134","246","26 July 2005"," Too Stupid To Believe
","You think the box office flop here had anything to do with the plot of The Island being too stupid to believe? <br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS........................................<br/><br/>How do they expect you to believe that this clone base and their illegal behavior wouldn't have been exposed in seven years? Congress passed legislation and specific laws yet no one ever enforces these laws? No one ever checks on the status of these clones in their ""vegetative state?"" None of these four thousand employees would suffer a crisis of conscience (killing mothers directly after giving birth?) and leak anything to the media? Employees like Steve Bucheme wouldn't talk or be an informant for cash? <br/><br/>Did we need the obligatory car crashes on the freeway scene? Can you say Matrix or Bad Boys 2? You would think that the truck driver would've noticed that he was losing most of his load after the first dozen giant metal dumbbells fell off his truck but no, he kept on driving.<br/><br/>It was nice to see that killer mercenary have a change of heart and help Scarlett at the end of the movie. Who cares that he was guiding his crew to kill as many cops as possible just a few scenes earlier on the streets of LA. Very believable plot turn there. Why did Scarlett assume that they would just capture her on the swingset? They've been firing bullets at her all day long and trying to kill her on site yet, they arrest her and don't even check to see if she's armed? Next, she's being prepped for surgery yet no one notices the gun? Unless she had the piece wedged clear up her huha, what's the deal with that? The ending is too stupid for words. He pulls one lever and everything blows up. Thus saving the day and making it possible to finish the movie with Michael Bay's patented wide angle swoop slow motion shots. (Not to mention the ""guy kissing girl swoop slo-mo shot-I thought I saw Ben Affleck kissing Liv Tyler in the background) <br/><br/>I could go on pointing out the stupidity of this movie but I've already wasted too much of my time on this trash. Some flops are just pure justice."
"agwon79","7","14","20","29 July 2005"," Great intro, crap ending
","Michael Bay... I really thought you were onto something different from your smash-em-up, shaky cam, action flick. The first hour of this film was excellent, but why did it have to become an action film with the moral fiber of Commando? In the beginning, we get the message that life, any life, is precious, then all the bad guys (even the not-so-bad guys) just start dropping like bricks, and we're supposed to feel happy when THAT happens. The initial chase scenes were great, but as time went by, they started to drag and then just became pointless.<br/><br/>The final ""showdown,"" as it were, was not necessary at all. Whatever happened to the ""going to the media"" plan? He could have still got Johanson with him and made a pretty good case, considering her famous host was dying at the hospital at same that time. Then he would have had enough evidence to get people to actually listen to him, and enough support to return to that place of doom with a small army at the very least.<br/><br/>But no, this is an action movie, so they must do this on their own, with a plan that required at least 95% dumb luck. And another thing, though we have improved on how we deal with the bad guy's demise in films since the 80's, many of us still think that the only way to deal with the bad guy is to kill him in a gruesome fashion, but really, wouldn't public exposure and shame have been better? Sean Bean had no time to even realize he had lost. Trust me, all he was thinking was ""I'm in a lot of pain."" The Shawshank Redemption, though a different kind of film, dealt with its villain in a way that I think could have worked very well for this film too.<br/><br/>As for the last scene (okay, second to last scene excluding the two of them on that stupid boat), ""Yay, they've all escaped!"" Now what? They're in the middle of the desert, and nothing has been explained to them, so they're all completely confused. Great finish, Michael Bay. At the very least, let us see that the government allowed them all to live the rest of their days out on a real island. Sappy ending, I know, but much more rewarding than what we got. That wasn't even a finish to the right movie! It was the ending from the bloody Lion King! I hear you all on some of the plot holes, and most of them I could overlook and still enjoy the movie. But this ending killed it for me."

","Ouch. I knew this movie would never live up to the hype as soon as I saw the trailer and recognized the plot as a direct steal from ""Parts:The Clonus Horror"" a movie a gleefully laughed at on Mystery Science Theater 3000 some years ago. Although this remake has been jazzed up and given spiffy special effects and a huge budget for blowing things up the story is just as badly thought out. The plot leaks like a sieve,life for the clones is un-fulfilling and is causing psychological problems for some (meds anyone?), the huge number of people working behind the scenes to keep things secret (that many people can't keep a secret, lowly wage slaves least of all), holographs to display the ""contaminated"" world (they are UNDERGROUND, just tell them that), and of course the fact that at least 50 or more people were killed in the chase scenes, no one would ever notices that in LA. Sigh but worst was the ending, it was so ripped from ""Logan's Run"" I expected to see Peter Ustinov waving at the clones.

"demonracer999","8","95","176","9 July 2005"," It is Michael Bays Best Ever! and most of it makes sense!
","The island is a futuristic action thriller. Set in the year 2019, residents the the last human city live sheltered lives after a disease has contaminated most of the globe. They know the ocean, grass, insects, and all of the worlds wonders only from pictures and looking outside the window. None of them have ever smelled fresh air. The only drive in their lives is that some day they could move to the last habitable island in the world. <br/><br/>The Island is pretty solid as an all around movie. Michael Bays visual sense actually completely fits the movie. The movie is down and gritty, which is why Bay was tapped to direct in the first place one would assume. As Far as the cast goes, Ewan McGregor did a great job. He performed above his usual standard. Especially in his scenes with himself (although during one of the car chases his Scottish character was played a bit BIG, but i think that was intended). Scarlett Johansson shows a new side in this film. She performs action, drama, and suspense perfectly. Michael Clarke Duncan gives the performance of the movie, although its a short one. Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean are also great, but take a back seat in the story. While Djimon Hounsou is under used and given a character arc most wont care about.<br/><br/>As far as the action cheese goes. Nothing was THAT cheesy. Although the part when two people fall off a skyscraper with a helicopter exploding like 3 feet away from them and they survive with tiny scratches will bother some. The joke that follows it makes it forgivable.<br/><br/>Over all it is a unusually solid movie, with more plot and character development than all of Bays other movies put together (minus pearl harbor). <br/><br/>So Watch And Enjoy This Surprising Summer Delight!"
"seaview1","7","63","114","15 July 2005"," The Island is a fun, summer flick
","Michael Bay has directed some big budget action adventures that have an over-the-top feel (like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon). He tones it down a bit and, despite borrowing from a myriad of past films, his latest effort, The Island, is an intelligent, entertaining adventure with science fiction as its source material.<br/><br/>In the not too distant future, there is a segregated world of men and women who function with a limited view and knowledge of their antiseptic world. Their only way of life is that they must work, follow the rules and dream of being selected in the lottery to go to The Island, the ultimate destination of happiness and fulfillment. One of the populace is a male, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), who begins to question his existence and role in the world even as he develops a friendship with a female, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson). He also experiences nightmares about an outside world and expresses doubts about the validity of his surroundings including the lottery. He relates these concerns to a friendly doctor, Merrick (Sean Bean) and later to an outsider, McCord (Steve Buscemi), a computer geek. As he explores the floors above him, he stumbles onto another level where he discovers a terrible truth and lie. Realizing that their world is only part of something much more, Lincoln and Jordan make a break to the outside with McCord's help and find themselves pursued by bounty hunters led by Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou). It seems that Merrick works for a cloning corporation dependent on enormous outside funds, and it is involved in secretly cloning humans for individual sponsors. The problem is that the corporation has gone too far in its experiments with tragic consequences. Searching for answers, Lincoln and Jordan eventually find themselves face to face with Lincoln's sponsor whereupon they decide to stop Merrick's evil plans and expose his horrifying activities to the world even as Laurent closes in. <br/><br/>This film is engaging from the very start with its interesting premise, and it does a good job of maintaining a steadily building mystery until the startling revelation which spins our protagonists in another direction. And if it seems the storyline is derivative of a multitude of other film plot lines, it's because concepts such as duplicate humans, memory loss, corporate societies, and the pursuit of individual freedom and identity in a futuristic setting have been visited before. There are strong echoes of Coma, Logan's Run, Minority Report, Total Recall, and especially George Lucas' early THX 1138 and John Frankenheimer's Seconds. And savvy viewers may recall an older made-for-television movie along the same lines called The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler. Yet by liberally borrowing from these stories, The Island reinterprets familiar themes into a reasonably entertaining story unto its own with a nod to science fiction author Philip Dick. <br/><br/>Adapted from his own story by Caspian Tredwell-Owen and Alias alums Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, the narrative takes a deliberate path, and its exciting action scenes, particularly the numerous chases on foot and by car, are in service of the plot. Michael Bay has been notorious for filming elaborate, 'shoot 'em up' and 'blow 'em up' set pieces that resemble a massive video game. Here, he holds back a little and concentrates more on staying true to his storyline. 'The play's the thing' and events move so rapidly, you don't notice the credibility gaps that strain logic at times. <br/><br/>Sean Bean (who is making himself quite the first choice in movie villainy as in Goldeneye) is quite good as the sinister Merrick, and Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator) registers in a role that could have been one dimensional and without heart. Ethan Phillips (late of Star Trek: Voyager) lends able support as a resident of the clone world. And let us not forget the wonderful Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs) who gets some of the best lines and exits much too soon. The leads, McGregor (Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith) and Johansson (Lost in Translation) are quite photogenic and work together quite well. One wishes they have future screen pairings. <br/><br/>The special effects are effective and especially impressive when Lincoln meets his dead on double. Those scenes are so good, they are seamless. The world of the near future is realistic in its depiction in much the way Blade Runner integrated futuristic vehicles and technology with older, existing buildings and settings. The pace is well edited, and the film never feels slow and boring.<br/><br/>Again, there are a couple of scenes which really strain credulity, but they come and go so quickly that you are on to the next scene. One obvious complaint is the product placement that becomes a bit self conscious and annoying after the third or fourth product logo is conspicuously shown. You'll see what I mean. It's also hard not to have a slight feeling that the film's main theme has controversial, political implications with the debate over cloning, stem cell research and the abortion fight in recent headlines.<br/><br/>Although it is ironically a clone of other film plots, The Island delivers legitimate action and thrills without sacrificing its linear storytelling. Let yourself go and don't pay too much attention to the occasional plot lapses, and you'll find this a reasonably diverting adventure."
"anhedonia","1","68","124","5 December 2005"," A good example of what's wrong with Hollywood
","Hollywood studio execs bemoaned the loss of revenue this summer. Every weekend, they kept coming up with new excuses, new reasons, new explanations as to why box-office receipts were low. They blamed the weather, proliferation of home theaters, DVD sales, rude movie patrons. Very few, if any, were willing to admit that the main reason fewer people went to movies this summer was because the most of the films stunk! ""The Island"" is a great example.<br/><br/>Here's a film with an intriguing idea and two very attractive and talented stars. In fact, the first 15, 20 minutes of this film were exciting and refreshingly good for a Michael Bay film.<br/><br/>There's was something awfully Kubrickian about the whole set up. The clinical atmosphere of the place, the entirely aloof attitude among the people. Knowing this was a Bay picture, I was pleasantly surprised. This story actually had some substance, something to say. The characters were interesting, their situations and dilemmas intrigued me.<br/><br/>Then the whole film went completely berserk. Michael Bay took over. And the likes of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson are relegated to saying dumb things you normally expect to see in a bad Will Smith movie as they're thrust into one inane action sequence after another. All those action scenes could've been jumbled and thrown back into the film and the plot would not have suffered one iota.<br/><br/>It's almost as if there are two films in one here. The first half creates an exciting world, raises probing ethical questions and seems intelligent. The second half is loud, obnoxious, unoriginal and a total waste of the early build up.<br/><br/>In the end, it's all bluster and thoroughly unsatisfying.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is yet another example of the dumbing down of America. You can't tell me there are no good original stories floating around Hollywood. It's just that execs are gutless, without vision and keep insisting on churning out the same garbage.<br/><br/>Of course, this time they were helped by loads of product placement. There are times when ""The Island"" seems like nothing more than a commercial, albeit an expensive one, for some product or another. The number of product-placement shots in this film is beyond vulgar, it's downright obscene.<br/><br/>I suppose the one reassuring thing about ""The Island"" is knowing that in the mid 21st century, Amtrak still will be running."

This movie is very unique while at the same time reminds you of Logun's Run. The score is well-paced and really sets the tone for the movie. The chase sequences are absolutely incredible and will have you on the edge of your seat. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are perfect in their roles and make the movie movie seem very real.

","Advertising master Michael Bay releases another product to grace our screens, more popcorn aimed at young teenage boys. His previous moneymakers include: Bad boys 1&2, Pearl Harbor, The Rock and Armageddon.<br/><br/>Its post-apocalyptic days 15 years into the future, the few survivors happily reside in a seemingly Utopians facility. They are all waiting for their chance to go to the last uncontaminated spot on Earth- The Island.<br/><br/>Despite what others view as the perfect lifestyle, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is perplexed by the controlled paradise. He asks the big questions: ""Why can't I have bacon and what is tofu anyway?"" The catalyst for his suspicions is a surreal dream where weird bald men drag him under water followed by Lincoln falling backwards into bed, featuring cinematography similar to Michel Gondry's.<br/><br/>After an hour long set up and two inmates dying the Island becomes less enticing and Lincoln escapes with Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson). It is later revealed by friend McCord (Steven Buscemi) ""you are clones of people out in the real world"". From here onwards the rest of the film can be described in two words: Chase Movie. The Actors make sure to remind you by repeatedly shouting 'run'.<br/><br/>Despite some impressive action sequences this movie is progressively boring. Although you cannot expect a lot from Bay this is his worst movie to date. The script is fruitless when conveying any drama or suspense and there are also those irritating comic cameos courtesy of Bay's strange jocosity. This is where he uses black actors to strike you with a witty one liner to give the bone crushing action that humorous spin. However praise is due for managing to utilize product placement to contribute to the storyline; Johansson's Calvin Klein ad helps the flustered character confirm that she is a clone.<br/><br/>The issue of human cloning is barely toyed with and as though biting back at the Americana he loves an extreme view is taken and the finger is pointed at the new American Dream: to remain forever young. However this is a change from Bay's usual films where America triumphs over adversity and prevents a cataclysmic disaster- again.<br/><br/>His infamous policy of 'style over substance' is already trivial; the film just feels like a 2-hour advertisement. Where the token slow motion effect, heavily edited shots and metal tracks cover for the absence of a story. No amount of loud sound effects and distorted guitar is going to badger anyone into mindlessly enjoying this. Even Bay admits that this film might be his first flop as it fails to attract the box office millions he is used to."

"Vulcan91","3","88","174","20 July 2005"," Just Make Sure You Don't Think While You Are Watching It
","Ewan McGregor has worked with the likes of Tim Burton and Ridley Scott. Scarlett Johansson has been directed by the daughter of one of the greatest directors of all time in an Oscar-nominated movie. Steve Buscemi has frequently been on the set with perhaps the godfathers of independent film-making, and Sean Bean has experience with just about everyone in Hollywood. So I have to wonder what went through the minds of these performers as they headed from their trailer to the set each day to find out the latest use Michael Bay had for his $100 million budget. ""I should have read this script a little closer""? ""My agent is so fired for this""? ""At least I'm making a ton of money""? ""I wonder what we get to blow up today""? <br/><br/>For that matter, I would be curious to witness what Michael Bay is like on the set. Surprisingly, ""The Island"" does not open to explosions and carnage, but actually begins with drama. In fact, Bay makes it through the first act before going buck wild. You can feel the tension mounting as the film progresses. You can picture Bay offscreen, gripping the arms of his chair, repeatedly glancing at his wristwatch. And then, he can wait no longer, and he leaps to his feet, flailing his arms wildly and screaming ""ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE LET'S BLOW SOME **** UP!"" And with that, all logic is abandoned. Things explode. Automobiles spiral wildly through the air. People scream. Guns blaze. And boy does this excite the filmmakers. The editor is having the time of his life, making a cut once every tenth of a second, and the cameraman is jerking the camera around as if he has completely lost his mind. Whoever is composing the score is sitting back and drinking coffee, having already taken the five minutes necessary to copy and paste an annoying jungle techno loop to run for two hours. Around the time railroad axles began falling off of the back of a truck demolishing cars (having just learned that in this futuristic world trains do not even use wheels, but levitate above the ground), I started laughing. I laughed without stopping until the credits rolled, and then I laughed my way out of the theater. In fact, ""The Island"" was unintentionally one of the funniest movies I have seen in years. The incredibly over the top action and the abrupt transitions between story and mindless chaos are so absurd that you cannot help but smile at how delightfully terrible this movie is.<br/><br/>""The Island"" does in fact have a plot, and at first it actually is a decent one. Sure, quite a few of the scenes seem to be ripped straight out of ""Logan's Run"" (Logan 5=Lincoln 6?), but heck, maybe it was just an admiring nod to the 70's cult classic. Before it degenerated into madness, I was quite optimistic about where the film was heading. The dialogue, as you would expect, is incredibly cliché at times, and a somewhat experienced movie-goer should be able to finish a lot of the actors' lines for them. One particular line near the end of the film certainly falls into my list of the cheesiest lines ever.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is mindless and has things exploding, which means it should attract the masses. It also makes summer blockbusters like ""I, Robot"" (which I did enjoy) look like a best picture nominee. There are a few things this movie will teach you, though: Cadillac, MSN, X-Box, Aquafina, Johnny Rockets, and Puma shoes are all excellent products, and stem cell research and cloning are evil Nazi practices.<br/><br/>May the box office slump continue...<br/><br/>1 star (out of 4)"

"naberry44","9","44","83","21 July 2005"," ""The Island"" is a great must see flick
","""The Island""<br/><br/>It is baffling why the movie industry is off the mark this season in regard to sales. There are a lot of really great movies out there this year. The latest summer blockbuster is Michael Bay's ""The Island."" Having created his reputation with such excellent efforts as ""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock,"" Bay is a perfect fit for this movie. His darkly rich while at the same time crude and seamy settings in tandem with his excellence in the ""everything blows up"" action sequence create a perfect match for this movie. If one is looking for a non-stop action thriller, this is the movie for them. In combination with decent writing, great cinematography, and some very fine performances, Michael Bay's talents are well utilized in a frenzied ""locomotive-out-of-control"" ride through the not so far in the future world of ""The Island.""<br/><br/>There is a compelling aspect to this movie from the very beginning. Ewan McGregor is Lincoln-Six-Echo one of the postage stamp residents of this brave new world. Indeed, one cannot help but remember ""Brave New World"", ""Logan's Run,"" and even Woody Allan's ""Sleeper"" when visiting this post Armageddon existence in 2019. It is an antiseptic world where all the residents dress the same, act the same, and live their lives in the same ""perfect"" existence. There, every activity is controlled by some unseen computerized ""god"". What they eat, where they work, when they rest, and even when and where they play are controlled. The reason, according to the ex positional narrative, is that the earth has been destroyed and they are the last remnants of an otherwise decimated population. The only inhabitable place left on earth is ""The Island"" and their lives revolve around waiting to be picked in a lottery to go live on the island. All would be fine in this ""flawless"" existence were it not for the presence of some persistent inquisitiveness that exists in the mind of Lincoln-Six-Echo. We soon find out that all is not as it seems. With the appearance of a butterfly in the catacombs where Lincoln visits his computer geek friend, McCord (Steve Buscemi), Lincoln is convinced that there is an outside world and he is destined to discover where it is. This is where the movie takes off. We follow the Lincoln character through a series of discoveries that eventually lead him to the truth. So as not to spoil the film, those ""truths"" will not be discussed here. Suffice it to say that the journey is grand. Taking recent lottery winner Jordan-Two-Delta (Scarlet Johansson) with him, we frenetically experience one cataclysmic event after another so that we are literally worn out in the end. Some of the crash and action sequences in this film will go down in filmdom as the greatest ever filmed. Throughout it all we receive glimpses of the truth and the ending is enjoyable, mind boggling, grandly cinematic, and entirely satisfying. <br/><br/>There is something about McGregor's puppy dog look and his devil-may-care bad boy demeanor that are incredibly endearing. From the very beginning he has the ability to make the moviegoer become part of his existence, his inquisitiveness, and his ultimate adventure to find the truth. He is an actor who brings deeply etched characters to the screen; the type of characters that make us want to be a part of their lives. This is a crucial quality in the success of a film that could easily rely on action sequences to make its mark. Having an actor who has the talent and capacity to ""pull"" the audience along is a tremendous benefit. Because his character is the quasi narrator of the film, it falls on McGregor's shoulders to bear this burden. He does so brilliantly. Not to be outdone, Scarlet Johansson holds her own in her characterization. Because of the nature of their characters, they have to maintain an childlike innocence that is done very well. Except for a portion of McGregor's performance (no spoilers here) both actors are able to portray a realistic naiveté that is vitally important to the success of this film. There are other fine performances as well. As Merrick, the ""psychologist"" running the show, Sean Bean is deliciously evil through and through. Michael Clarke Duncan turns in a short but entirely satisfying performance as a lottery winner  quite possibly a ""show stealer."" Steve Buscemi is, as always, down and dirty but lovable all at the same time in his turn as McCord, a worker from the outside world who helps the two escapees on their quest. Lastly, one must not overlook another solid performance by Djimon Hounsou as a futuristic bounty hunter. He makes the most out of a small part by instilling heart and soul into his portrayal. <br/><br/>Bottom line is, this is a great flick. If you like blow-em-up action, you will love this film. If you like man-against-the machine, you will love this film. If you like happy endings, and a little romance, you will love this film. Go see it, you won't regret it."

The last half of the film is them on the run, trying to tell someone what the truth is all about with this project and all the while escaping an army of pursuers.<br/><br/>I was expecting more of a lower-key, intelligent story but this turned out to be an Arnold Schwarzenegger-type action movie, which isn't all bad because Arnold's films were at least entertaining. This has the same stuff: outrageous scenes in which incredible things happen to the heroes....like assassins shooting at them from 30 feet away and never hitting them or falling from tall buildings....and never getting hurt! These two leads have nothing on Superman. They are indestructible, apparently. It's lunacy....but it certainly has it's fun moments with some tremendous stunt work.<br/><br/>To me, the best aspect of this film was the stylish camera-work.

","This movie starts off well. The plot in particular is very intriguing as is the question of whether it is ethical to clone people for their organs. And this question of ethics is what is used to draw the viewer in. So i was surprised that about 30 mins of the movie was dedicated to developing this theme and the rest was just a string of action sequences. Yes, for what it was this movie was an entertaining action flick. But it really could've been much more than that, in the hands of a decent director. Seriously, why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies? All the cast were excellent in their roles, but you could tell they were crying out for a better script. The movie seemed shallow and bereft of depth although it had a good plot and theme. If you're after action then this movie will keep you entertained for 2 hours, yet if you thought this was going to be a sci-fi, makes you question humanity sort-of-movies, then you'll be disappointed by The Island."

","I caught THE ISLAND on a movie channel and boy what a vivid sense of deja vu I had.The whole thing is just a mish mash of a dozen movies combined unconvincingly and the end product is a pretty hollow cinematic experience. LOGAN'S RUN, BLADE RUNNER, THX 1138 are just some of the movies this Michael Bay epic freely rips off from. There's a scene in THE ISLAND that's virtually identical to a scene in BLADE RUNNER. I was shocked when I saw it. No one sued? <br/><br/>What's truly shocking about this film (or I should call ""product"") is not the obvious borrowing of ideas from other famous and not so famous films (such as PARTS: THE CLONUS HORROR, for example) but the mechanical way the entire thing is made. Michael Bay wouldn't know how to create an authentic moment if his life depended on it. The whole thing is so depressing. The many ideas and concepts, which could have been profound and meaningful, were absurdly glossed over for simplistic action plot points. The clichés were free flowing: scenes like the ""I'm the real Tom Lincoln"" part were cringe worthy. We've seen this happen a million times. In fact, I recently saw GOLIATH VS THE VAMPIRES and there's an identical ""who is the bad/good character"" moment in that film made in the early 1960s. Nice to see that things haven't changed much in the last 45 years. <br/><br/>There's absolutely nothing fresh in THE ISLAND. It's just a very elaborate and pointless excuse for stupid and overdone action scenes. The moment when the two characters hang to dear life on that logo outside a skyscraper (which, btw, is almost identical to the one in TOMORROW NEVER DIES) is so unrealistic and cartoonish that I thought I was watching a movie directed by McG (the director of the CHARLIE'S ANGELS movies). After that scene, the film never really recovered from total schlocky absurdity.<br/><br/>The actors are totally wasted. Djimon Hounsou's entire screen appearance is in slow motion. Probably a first in cinematic history for a major actor!<br/><br/>THE ISLAND is just one of the many patently bad movies made and released from Hollywood these days which is basically heralding the death of cinema."
"whiteshaft","3","24","45","24 July 2005"," Come on people... this movie SUCKS
","It's amazing how the comment sections have been co-opted by studio flacks masquerading as fans. This movie is already tanking (opened at No. 4) and you can just smell the desperation. When you're reading a positive review that sounds more like a press release than a casual remark, you're probably reading the work of a publicist. Just FY to the I people.<br/><br/>You can't rate Michael Bay movies against other films, as they fall into their own category that almost defies criticism; you can only compare one Bay film to another. If you're of the opinion that ""Armageddon"" is somewhere near ""Lawrence of Arabia"" in quality then sorry, you're beyond help. His films are loud, bombastic, misogynistic exercises in excess. If you go into ""The Island"" expecting that then you'll find it. Just don't call it a ""good"" film.<br/><br/>As to the comments about how great the story is this time out, let me just say there isn't ONE moment in this film that is not derivative of another scifi film. It lifts liberally and shamelessly from ""The Matrix"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Coma"", ""THX-1138"" and a cult film called ""The Clonus Horror"". In fact there are so many similarities between ""Island"" and ""Clonus"" -- plot, circumstances, costumes, human-sized Ziplocs -- that I think the creators of the old film could sue. If you think it's okay to support this kind of 'throw it in a blender' approach to screen writing then don't complain when the studios keep churning out these Franken-films made from parts of other (better) films you've already seen.<br/><br/>The most disturbing part of the film is not the depiction of human cloning, but the depiction of women and minorities. The future that Bay paints is practically lilly-white, despite what you see now when you step outside. I think I saw a few token minorities sprinkled amongst the clones but most of them are white. The handful of black characters in the film (with the barest of exception of Hounsou's) only further the usual stereotypes; there's the big sassy woman with attitude, the guy who's friends with Jesus, and the athlete. And women in general don't come off any better, represented as perfume models, strippers, baby factories or your basic dumb whore.

","Michael Bay could be one of the worst, big-budget directors in the history of film, although he showed promise in his early years with some of his television work. never what i would consider a ""deep"" guy, and ignoring history quite a bit, i was somewhat surprised by The Island. yes, it was over-blown, unsubtle, and a mixed genre. but this time, Mr. Bay has something important to say. he's clearly made up his mind about this subject matter, but this is still a departure for a guy who always seems to manage to get investors for his crappy films. and an audience too. let's see, what does Mr Bay see in this bleaker (i didn't think it was possible), sadder theme of Brave New World , Blade Runner, and 1984? 1)clones have souls. 2)the populace can be and are easily brain-scrubbed 3)the medical establishment will do anything for money 4)Sean Bean is used to being killed in his movie roles. Steven Buscemi too; always a joy to watch him. 5)the strength of the ""human"" spirit shouldn't be underestimated. 6)we don't really know what life is, how life is defined 7)Scarlett Johansson has a strong grip and is no wimp 8)Mr Bay doesn't go anywhere without his hammer 9)the question of bio-ethics could be the biggest oxymoron there is<br/><br/>this is a bleak, nightmarish vision of the future gone horribly wrong. it is a picture of extremes with those who have and those who have not, and that we can make people believe ANYTHING with enough money, media, and brain-washing (doesnt really sound so sci-fi, does it...). but it is also an action film that people can watch without having to do too much thinking. it is one of Mr Bay's better films, which really isn't saying much. there are many, many plot holes. it's about reaching THE ISLAND, the grand prize, the lottery win, heaven, freedom. like that old adage, be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it."

","Based solely on the fact that the premise of the movie was mildly compelling I will refrain from dubbing it the worst movie I have ever seen. That said, I am considering suing Michael Bay for the pain and suffering he caused myself and my family. I cannot think of a single aspect of this movie, save the premise, that did not completely blow. The entire thing, all 136 minutes was an assault on my senses, my time and most importantly my intelligence. The action scenes were completely unbelievable, choppy and poorly executed. The dialog was at best lame and contrived. The acting was atrocious - disappointing considering I like, McGregor, Johanson, Buscemi and Hounsou (my god what were they thinking). But without doubt the worst thing this pile of garbage had to offer was the continuous, relentless and painfully obvious commercials for everything from Puma to X-Box to Aquafina. If you value your time and money do not under any circumstances even consider seeing this movie and if any of your friends try to convince you otherwise be careful...they are not your real friends."

","As a self proclaimed most hated man amongst critics in Hollywood, Michael Bay has done nothing over the years to deflect his growing reputation. His filmography reads like a loud speaker of summer trash including Bad Boys I and II, The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. Each of these films was panned by critics like Alaskan gold in 1896. Their success at the box office however is teetering on a money in the bank title as his last four ventures have all made over $100 million and if we include the foreign and DVD market intake, Bay has become the youngest and quickest director to ever become a Billion Dollar Man.<br/><br/>The reason his films are so reviled by the print and entertainment media is due to the large scale productions brought to the screen with scripts as flimsy as a wet noodle and dialogue that leaves audiences groaning like Lurch when the doorbell rings. For explosions, car chases and pyrotechnics aside, you can only stand for so many ""Every night I watch the sunset and soak up every last ray of its warmth, and send it from my heart to yours"" lines before your popcorn receptacle is turned into a barf bag.<br/><br/>Well, Michael Bay is back on the summer bandwagon with his latest entry, The Island  his first film without the Jerry Bruckheimer producing credit behind his name. This extravaganza stars Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson (Obi-Wan Kenobi and The Girl with the Pearl Earring for those of you at home who don't readily recognize the names), as two humans who have been harvested as clones for potential organ usage. They live in a community that separates them from the rest of the world. They have the intellectual level of a fifteen year old and seem (in their minds) to exist with only the hope of winning a rigged lottery that would send them to an open air island, the only uncontaminated location in the outside world.<br/><br/>But their suspicions and subsequent investigations reveal more then they imagined and they soon find themselves outside of the lab and on the run from the officials of the facility. Unfamiliar with their new surroundings, the two dodge various authorities while on the search for their sponsor (the owner of their organs) in an attempt to tell them the truth and hopefully reveal to the world the fact that they are more than brain dead embryos.<br/><br/>The Island has two different and distinct parts. Part One stays with the science fiction elements of the harvesting human community. It is part 1984, part Logan's Run and is very successful in creating a world that is fascinating and futuristic but also alarming with the questions about human cloning that are ripped from today's headlines.<br/><br/>But when the two escaped 'spare parts' find themselves in the big city, Michael Bay gets to take off the first hour shackles and do what he does best. Blow things up. In the last hour of the film, we definitely get what a summer film promises with explosions, helicopter chases, destruction on an unfathomable level and a spectacular car chase scene that is one of the best metal meets larger metal destruction scenes in many a summer.<br/><br/>The result of the two parts being put together is Michael Bay's best film to date. That is not to say that I am running out to see the 127 minute film yet again, but unlike say Pearl Harbor or Armageddon, I didn't find myself shifting in my seat or looking at my watch wondering if I can endure the films final chapters. It is insightful  well, the first half  and incredibly entertaining  well, the second half. Not unlike Spielberg's Minority Report, The Island delivers an intelligent story surrounded by loud noises that will shake the foundation of my basement through a subwoofer when the DVD is released around Christmas time.<br/><br/>So, I have to give Michael Bay a get out of jail free card for this 21st century fantasy. It was a wild ride that continues what I have felt to be a rather impressive summer of releases that above the mediocrity we are accustomed to from May until August. I do feel that the world is close to coming to an end since I appreciated a Michael Bay effort, but hey, if I can get the value out of the price of a ticket admission now a days, I am a happy camper.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","Why do you insist of making films where everything has to blow up? Is it really necessary to have stunts that no person in real life could ever achieve in every film? Why? This movie could have been great. I had very low expectations going in and thought it was going to be nothing more than a rip of Logan's Run. Surprisingly the first half of the film was really good. The premise was interesting and well thought out. I was intrigued to find out what was going to happen. The escape scene into the desert was great. and then it happened... The M. Bay took the cuckoo out of the clock. The second half of the film is drenched with over the top special effects and ridiculous feats of human prowess. (Surviving a fall off a building comes to mind.) The film turns from being a cerebral sci-flick into a trailer for bad boys 3. I am going to refer to this movie from here on out as the movie that could have been. This is a really disappointing film."

","Paul Verhoeven makes movies that pollute the eye. If you are serious about movies, you cannot avoid bad ones. In fact, if you love movies, you love bad ones as well.<br/><br/>But that's not the same as tolerating crassness, as deliberately allowing a vulgar non- appreciation of films by filmmakers into your soul. This isn't a dialog, building an imagination. You don't have to have ""both sides,"" the artful and the sidewalk dust. <br/><br/>So on the list goes Michael Bay. He just doesn't seem to have anything useful to offer. Sure, there is a lot of movement of the kind you can get by huffing gas, but there isn't the same color that you can get from someone who can actually speak, like say Tony Scott or his brother.<br/><br/>There used to be a genre, a science fiction summer movie genre. You'd start with some clever setup. Most old science fiction was engineered to exploit some societal foible or devise a means to encounter self, sometimes both. We have that setup here, though borrowed from all over with no attention to annealing the seams.<br/><br/>Then you'd add some tension and action and naturally some love. But it all worked because the container was big and solid. The science fiction cover allowed the contents to be brash. Thing even about ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" or even the Matrix things and my ""Constantine."" They worked as what they were because the container was solid.<br/><br/>There's effectively no container here, nothing but the noise.<br/><br/>Its all so hard to grasp. Evan McGregor knows how to do the folded acting thing. He's already been in two of the most accomplished films of the last ten years: ""Pillow Book"" and ""Moulin Rouge,"" plus some tolerable ones. Miss Scarlett knows how to pose to imply intelligence, usually adding something. <br/><br/>Oh well. Sometimes I say a film isn't worth watching. This time I say watching this can do you harm.

","This movie is a direct rip-off of the 1979 film The Clonus Horror. Here is the IMDb plot summary of that movie.<br/><br/>""Plot Summary for The Clonus Horror (1979) A young man escapes from a government run project called Clonus only to find out that Peter Graves (Jeff Knight) a candidate for Presidency is a conspirator to keep Clonus a secret. Top government officials are aware of it and support the super secret project, because they are cloning themselves to live longer and better lives, at the expense of their clone counter-part, who is no more than a ""slave"" as far as human rights are concerned. The ethical and moral values are explored as the escapee (Tim Donnelly) known as Richard returns full circle back to Clonus, only to find his girlfriend lobotomized for government security purposes.""<br/><br/>It is surprising the creators of The Clonus Horror have not filed a lawsuit. The Island also rips off heavily from The Matrix and Logan's Run, both of which are much superior films. <br/><br/>Directed by Michael Bay, The Island stars Scarlett Johansson (LOST IN TRANSLATION) and Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS) as Lincoln Six Echo/Tom Lincoln and Jordan Two Delta/Sarah Jordan. <br/><br/>Unlike the Clonus Horror, this movie has product placements for the following products, and they are VERY OBVIOUS: Aquafina, Puma shoes, Cadillac, MSN, X-Box, Johnny Rockets. Much of the movie has the philosophical depth of a commercial.<br/><br/>You may remember the joke in This Is Spinal Tap about the amplifier with a volume knob that goes to 11. The volume on this movie is 49. <br/><br/>There are the obligatory car chases and the two stars are wasted in this bombastic mess."

It's all there: the isolated compound, the diets and exercise, the indoctrination, and the clones bred to be simple and compliant and not to question authority. The biggest difference is the budget and the scale.<br/><br/>In this version, Ewan McGregor is the lone voice who starts to question his existence and yearn for something more than the regimented life in a world that looks like a cross between an antiseptic prison and a socialist compound overseen by a seemingly benign Big Brother, who manages everything from clothing to diet to the lottery that sends the lucky winners to ""the Island.""<br/><br/>The final third is pure Michael Bay, however: a half-baked plan that stretches credulity and maximizes on screen destruction.<br/><br/>Fiveson should sue."

","Despite being familiar with Michael Bay's previous work, going into this movie I really wanted to like it. The initial preview was intriguing; the actors were an interesting mix and the visual style (of the preview) was alluring. Once the movie began I was not disappointed, the acting was great throughout the whole movie (with the exception of Hounsou's flat entrance as the stock ex-navy seal turned mercenary) and the style was very reminiscent of the better of the late 70's/early 80's sci-fi movies (e.g. Blade Runner, Logans Run). The story itself, at it's bare bones, is interesting and could have been developed beautifully, the problem is it wasn't. About 45 minutes to one hour into the movie it turned into a surfeit of action that lasted the rest of the movie leaving no room for any further development of plot or characters, but left plenty of room for cheesy one-liners I've come to grudgingly expect from big budget Hollywood movies. The action itself was fairly typical and bland in this era of super-stylized movies (i.e. Kill Bill, House of Flying Daggers, and Sin City) but unlike these movies it isn't anything beautiful to watch and left me fighting off dire boredom. The bottom line: this movie ends up being a typical Hollywood action flick if you like Bay's previous films you will LOVE this movie. If not there is some appeal to this movie and the beginning coruscates quite brightly, but ultimately disappoints."
"Jimstev1","8","32","69","9 July 2005"," Michael Bay's best film to watch for the audience
","I'm not a Michael Bay fan, but I love a lot of his shots and style sometimes but he can tend to get cheesy. In his latest film "" The Island"" he has finally put together an entertaining, intense film that will put the audience with great satisfaction of action and some storytelling. Most of his films are just about the action. Bad Boys 2 was just nonstop action with some humor that made the film last too long but still a very well put together summer film. Although, The Island had a slow start but finally adapted to getting you into the story and got a bit suspenseful. From there on your hooked into the film and like the characters more and adds some humor mixed in with the action. I recommend seeing The Island with a group of friends because it's not a film to just sit by yourself and have no one to turn to and say ""thats so cool"". I had the pleasure of saying that with my group of friends when we attended the sneak preview screening this Saturday night. It's a wild ride of good suspense, action and some funny humor. Michael Bay has made something that's worth the time to sit through this two hour film. Two thumbs up!"

","I saw this movie last night in a sneak preview in Los Angeles. I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, it looked like it would be a visual feast, like other Bay films are, but I wasn't sure what it was about. And to be honest, for the first 45 minutes or so I still wasn't sure what it was about. I was more in shock than anything and I was wondering if it was going to start making more sense. But it comes together really well and you totally understand it but appreciate the fact that it stretches your mind. And it has a good dose of comedy, but not just from Steve Buscemi, (who steals every scene he is in) but it offers simplistic and entertaining humor all around. Yes, there are certain ""plot holes"" and I am sure that the story wasn't as strong as it could be but Ewan and Scarlett have such good chemistry and the movie is just so much fun that you don't notice the mistakes or the weaknesses. <br/><br/>In short, it entertains as it works. <br/><br/>I think the people that will be the biggest critics of this movie are the ones that can't get past the realistic factor. But I guess you could say it is unrealistic in the same way Minority Report was, you have to be able to get into the different world they are creating for you. And it is a bit long at parts, but you don't mind cause it's enjoyable. <br/><br/>I really liked it, and if you are looking for a visual feast and that fun summer action film, skip Fantastic Four and check out The Island."

","People's average rating of this movie as around 7 out of 10 is proof that Hollywood's brain-dead action formula works. It puts asses in seats, and thrills them. No matter how devoid of any proper contents it is.<br/><br/>The Island was a huge disappointment to me. The sci-fi story wasn't taken seriously at all; it was simply an excuse for a meaningless, standard action movie. Sure, there were some cool scenes (which is the only reasons I'm rating this movie a 3 out of 10 after all), but there were far more laughable ones. Take the story. It had no depth, no discernible kind of symbolism, made no statement of any note, and was founded on gaping plot holes. Yeah, it's very popular to say that a story has plot holes, but it's less common to actually list them. So that's what I'll do:<br/><br/>1. The movie could not have been made without the clones having conscious lives. How did they explain the need for this? By saying that if they didn't have some semblance of proper lives, their organs would atrophy. This is bull. People can be kept alive indefinitely without a conscious life. Even brain-dead people can be kept alive.<br/><br/>2. The movie could not have been made without the rebellion of Echo and his generation, which was caused by their suddenly developing the memories of their original human hosts! How??? Never explained. Because it can't be explained.<br/><br/>3. The suppression of sexual urges. How was this done? Not explained. How was that suppression circumvented so the two mains could discover sex? Not explained.<br/><br/>4. The subplot with Jordan's human host being dying was never developed. A lot could have been done with that, but it was basically just completely ignored.<br/><br/>Those were the worst plot holes (and don't call them ""artistic license"" - they were purely commercial license). But there were more. There was a cool scene of Lincoln and Jordan fighting each other in some kind of video game. Why O Why didn't they use any of these fight skills when they were pursued by the bad guys??? Why smack a pursuer with a wrench when Jordan could have scissor-kicked his head off???? Of all the wasted opportunities... And also, since Jordan's human host was a celebrity out in the real world, appearing in a big public commercial and having been in at least three men's magazines, how come nobody on the street recognized her?<br/><br/>Much of the extremely protracted action in this movie was the usual baaad kind of movie action that's been done to death - oooh, the bad guy conveniently slips on some pellets! Oooh, the heroes fall off a skyscraper but miraculously land in some conveniently placed net! Cripes, that bleedin' sucks! I can't believe I'm even giving this movie 3 stars. It was the worst kind of popular tripe Hollywood has turned out since... well, since the last crappy action movie. Gah."

","A ""Primrose Utopia""! That is what the inhabitants of the Compound think awaits them at The Island. The Compound is where the remainder of the human race lives, after the world has been completely contaminated, and the Island is on the only place left on Earth that is not contaminated. At least, this is what we, and the characters, are led to believe in this futuristic film. The reality, which Echo must discover, is far from this.<br/><br/>Watching this film I can't help but think about B.F. Skinner, and his famous and controversial book on Utopian societies called Walden Two. Of course, in Walden Two the Utopian society wasn't a preposterous scheme dreamed up by the controllers of the world. Yes, this would be more like an anti-Utopian society. Regardless, this is a really good movie worth watching, and makes one wonder if Ethan and Echo are simply clones."

That said, the story is updated, the pace and excitement have gone up a few levels and Lincoln goes places Logan never did. America of the future looks great CGI wise and I found the action set pieces to be very exciting. The main car chase is the best I've seen in a long time.

","Others have mentioned ""Logan's Run"", ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"" as possible inspirations for the movie, but those do far more justice to the totalitarian/faux-utopian story genre. I just found it so terribly bad, like this was the low carb, diet coke version of a much superior film. And it's not because it was visually bad (though the scene where Ewan McGregor's character pees out metal pellets will forever burn an imprint into the pain sector of my brain), this shallow film seemed to miss the point entirely.<br/><br/>The blatant product placement, the smug and rather unlikable main characters take away from the basic premise and tired plot, which drags on for 2 hours too long. I think that was the Achilles' heel of the film. People have to be able to empathize with McGregor's or Johansson's plight, or at least like them a little, but I don't even feel sorry for them on any emotional level because they don't have humanistic flaws. It was not unlike watching a spoiled socialite use a rotary dial phone or an anorexic supermodel talking about starving children in third world countries . The clones are not like you and I. They are immaculate carbon copies with elementary school level educations, coyly unaware of their budding sexuality. They were raised on perfect body farms and tanning booths (probably), so who actually cares if they get scrapped for parts? It's a formulaic, Hollywood engineered effects-spectacular: have male and female leads that the 17-32 demographic finds attractive + a lot of special effects + tried (and tried and tried) and true plot = box office success, right?.<br/><br/>Except that the people who wrote this movie (it's not a film because it lacks expository depth, don't strain yourself reaching for the dictionary to tell me the definition) greatly underestimated the average movie-goer's intelligence. Yes, people including myself enjoy wasting money on dumb funny films if it makes them laugh, but only if it's on purpose (a la ""Snakes on a Plane""). The cameos by Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve Buscemi had me wondering if Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck were going to show up, then Bruce Willis could crash through a window 'yippee ki yay' style after rising from his extraterrestrial grave and do ""Armageddon 2: Asteroid's Revenge"". The superficiality is kind of insulting by movie's end. Audiences enjoyed somewhat similar films like ""The Matrix"", ""Blade Runner"",(sigh) ""V for Vendetta"", and of course the previously mentioned classic novels/films ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", and ""Brave New World"" because they were well written, despite astronomically lower budgets and outdated special effects.<br/><br/>But if you enjoy predictability, massive explosions, and artificial sweeteners, you just might enjoy this movie and all other saccharin Michael Bay movies.

That is, to everyone except Lincoln and Jordan, who manage to escape the confines of their claustrophobic environment, only to be met by an unfamiliar external reality.<br/><br/>With absolutely no knowledge of their surroundings, they must become a part of civilization in their attempt to uncover a conspiracy, while also attempting to survive and outrun their pursuers.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is, in many respects, two films in one. It begins as a futuristic sci-fi exploration which gleams with cold, sterile surfaces and meticulous organization, but soon, it descends onto a more pedestrian platform and transforms itself into Mr. Bay's signature showcase of fiery chaos. Nevertheless, both parts seamlessly compliment each other to offer the viewer, if not a tropical adventure, then at least, a cinematic one."
"brendonm","7","10","19","21 July 2005"," put LOGAN'S RUN, THX-1138 and FORTRESS in a blender and you get THE ISLAND
","I'll just come out and say it: I'm NOT a Michael Bay fan. Of his films, only THE ROCK would I consider a great popcorn movie. But this is an entertaining, well-made and (for a genre pic) well-acted movie. There's still the typical over-the-top action sequences (at one point I felt like I was in the Halo video game) and the shaky-cam does get tiring at times. And let it be said the story is highly derivative of LOGAN'S RUN, THX-1138 and FORTRESS. But given the recent news coverage of stem-cell research and cloning, the story resonates. I swear, this is the first Michael Bay movie that made me think -- is this a sign of the apocalypse?! ;-)<br/><br/>If you like sci-fi with some action throw in, you'll probably enjoy this."
"mjdr007","2","18","39","24 July 2005"," Worst movie you could possibly see this summer!
","I would give this movie 1 star, but the first half hour of the film was decent. As for the rest of it--well... please, Mr. Michael Bay, stop making movies that insult viewer's intelligence. The film starts as with a nice pace and tone, similar to Blade Runner and THX 1138. Then it takes an odd turn--a turn that feels almost like Michael Bay had a big bag of pre-set action scenes that had to be put into the movie. Mr. Bay reaches into the bag and randomly takes out each of these action scenes and scatters them into the thinning plot, detaching the viewer from the characters and removing any hint of passion that the film's opening act was ready to unfold.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Michael Bay used to handle action scenes quite well. But even the action in The Island cannot justify my ticket price. The action was so over the top it became nonsensical and funny--almost as funny as the nearly insulting use of product placement (of which only one product made me say ""ooooh coooooool""; and that was a pretty sweet looking Caddy).<br/><br/>I do have to give the film some credit, Ewan McGregor does a fine acting job as do Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean. And I think Scarlett Johansson is good actor, but hardly saw the point of her character. <br/><br/>To make a long, annoyed review short, if you have any interest in this type of sci-fi movie, please look at Blade Runner, Thx 1138, AI, Alien3 (The director's cut)."

Good fun, visually impressive but ""suspend your disbelief"" if you want to enjoy it fully. <br/><br/>Although the some of you might see the similarities between this and the classic Logan's Run (Carosel begins.....Lottery begins....)

"eline-hoskens","10","5","8","5 August 2013"," Great movie, great soundtrack!
","I rated this movie as excellent because it's one of my all-time favourite action sci-fi movies. Although there are a number of goofs to be noticed and there are some gaps in the plot, it's really enjoyable! I never get tired of watching it again. <br/><br/>This movie is probably so underrated because it is a Michael Bay movie. Once you get the reputation as a director that you'll always settle for cheap testosterone driven, mindless, superficial plot lines centered around big explosions and chases, it seems like you can never make up for that again. <br/><br/>Still, the Island has a great script, an awesome soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky, a lot of humour and intelligent themes. <br/><br/>It's scary but this story is not that far-fetched. It makes you think about what would actually happen if scientists were able to make exact copies of people. In a world where people want an abortion just because delivering a baby will ruin their figure, it's scarily credible. The Island is a very well told story about love, hope and friendship. People risking their lives for each other always warms your heart in a time where cynicism and naturalism are quite popular. Movies like the Island remind you that people can be really harsh and selfish but that at least they don't all have to be like that. <br/><br/>Scarlet Johannson and Ewan McGregor are very talented actors, perfect for these parts. They portray a childlike innocence and curiosity with utmost integrity in a very touching way. You really feel for the main characters and not just the main characters, all characters. <br/><br/>This movie also has great visuals. They way Lincoln's dream turns into reality in the opening scene, the way the camera pans over these prenatal agnates to reveal 'where the tubes go', ... <br/><br/>I really love this movie, despite the items I added to the goofs page. ;-)"
"Lemos","7","5","8","7 January 2006"," Michael Bay surprise!
","I have enjoyed most of Michael Bay's films, not because they are clear-cut works of art, but mostly because they have always been high on the adrenalin, male-driven testorene action levels. I was never under any illusions that most of his body of work would ultimately test the grey matter. However, not withstanding the above statement, The Island is a notable exception - contains all the ingredients that have made him notable, plus a great thought-provoking storyline including star performances from most of the actors. If closely scrutinised the plot contains some glaring incongruencies, but overall it is mostly smart and intelligent and is expertly filmed and interpreted. If you enjoyed Blade Runner, Gattaca, Minority Report, Articial Intelligence, then check this movie out - you will not be disappointed."
"mihai_s","7","5","8","21 December 2005"," Very enjoyable futuristic chase movie
","Pros: Beautiful and interesting sets: they look futuristic and are truly beautiful and interesting in themselves, but are also very convincing - they look very much like ""not so distant future"". Also, I liked a great deal the many car prototypes that show up in the movie (although some shots included cars we see today on the roads and it does not make sense they would still be around quite a few decades from now). As for the Matrix references, I did not see it as shameless copying, but a nod to the granddaddy of all utopias-that-are-actually-cover-ups-for-something-horrifying. Gorgeus music score: nothing extraordinary, but it did ad to some intense scenes. Beautiful lead actress: Scarlett Johansson was beautiful before, but here she looks ravishing - and plays a child-like innocence very well at times. The movie also includes some pretty good special effects, editing and camera work. As for acting, it's not great, but overall the movie manages to get you involved - some of the action scenes are very intense, and a couple of gruesome scenes really get to you. Cons: the usual that come with an action-packed, blockbuster-wannabe Hollywood movie: some plot holes here and there, lead characters that go through bone-crushing events and come out with just a scrape, as well as the usual logical holes of movies on cloning. Bottom line: definitely an enjoyable action movies with a futuristic theme, and a few things that make it stand out of the action-movie pack and whose theme and images might stick around in your memory for a while."

","When I saw The Island was directed by Michael Bay, I was skeptical. He makes a lot of exciting action movies but when something is not blowing up, his movies get stale. Bad Boys II was particularly annoying and did anybody really care who got the girl in Pearl Harbor. Well, The Island pleasantly surprised me. In the future, Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanson live in a state of the art city where everybody awaits a chance to go to the island. I don't think I am giving anything away (since it is given away in the previews) that they are in fact clones of real people who just use the clones to increase their lifespan. After the two discover the truth, they escape. There are a lot of well made car chases and a great action sequence on top of a building. Yes the story is a mix of THX-1138, The 6th Day, Logan's Run, and Michael Bay action movies, but I went around for the ride. It may not be a great movie (it borrows too much from what came before) but it is a fun movie to watch. It is also better scifi than Steven Spielberg's overrated War of The Worlds remake."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","5","8","15","13 July 2006"," A cut-rate Dystopian film
","While Michael Bay is not exactly known for his subtlety or artistic merit in Hollywood, one would think that he could at least handle a brainless sci-fi action film like The Island. But he fails, and this is a waste of time. This film does not have an ounce of originality to save itself or a standout performance to keep your attention. The closest it comes to this is rentable bad guy Sean Bean and an occasionally funny Steve Buscemi is a quirky supporting role.<br/><br/>Another redeeming aspect to The Island is the emphasis placed on technology in society. This whole theme is borrowed from Brave New World so it is hardly innovative, but it definitely fits in today's world and the premise of The Island. It is refreshing to see that the big budget of the production was not spent on late night taco-runs, but on realistic props and CGI effects. In that sense, The Island is quite fun to watch.<br/><br/>In the bigger sense, it is uninvolving to watch because you cannot compensate hammy acting (Scarlett, this was your worst performance ever), plot holes en masse, an unoriginal story, uninvolving action sequences and contrived 'emotional' character development with just nice visual effects. 5/10"
"beeryusa","1","8","15","18 December 2005"," Plot holes you could drive that Mack truck through
","Honestly, this movie is absolutely HORRIBLE. They use quick cuts to disguise the fact that virtually nothing in this film makes any sense at all. They keep clones conscious - why? They bring Scarlett Johannsen's character back to the base and leave her armed with a pistol - why? These are just two major plot flaws in a movie so packed with them that the editors had to resort to a blazing fast pace and blatant cutting tricks just to cover them. Oh, this movie was foul. Everyone involved should be embarrassed about this train wreck of a film. Towards the end it got so bad that I was pleading for it to just end, but it just kept on going and going."

","""Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor)"" and ""Jordan Two Delta"" (Scarlett Johansson) are living in a huge city complex. They know each other as friends but nothing more. Everything is monitored and nobody cares about the fundamental and existential questions in life. Nobody except Lincoln Six Echo. He starts to sense that something is wrong and when his friend Jordan Two Delta is suddenly in danger, a larger conspiracy is unraveled.<br/><br/>Nothing in the plot or the story is original and there are no plot-twists to surprise you along the way. However, even though the story is far out, it's well told and works as solid foundation for the other parts of the movie. The themes of the story have all been told before, but this is not a movie you see because you want to broaden your horizon. You see this movie to get some action.<br/><br/>In their quest to reveal the truth McGregor and Johansson have to escape a lot of nasty people, and they usually do it in quite a spectacular manner. The action scenes are both good and bad. On the plus side is their sheer intensity and scale. Tonnes of hardware and people are destroyed or molested in the most fantastic ways. On the down side is the confusion of the action scenes. The camera is literally thrown around in the air, making it impossible to see what's going on. Maybee I'm just old, but sometimes it's nice with a static camera that leaves room for the well-choreographed action scene. To sum it all up however, the action scenes are decent and worth the money.<br/><br/>The style of the movie is very polished and full of candy for all the senses. Michael Bay has a way of combining beautifully shot scenes (some slow motion) with voluptuous sound and music, in an almost vulgar fashion. It's the Michael Bay trait and people who have seen The Rock or Armageddon will recognize it. It's his style and if you don't like it, don't see this movie. Personally I loved it! When you see the movie, also take notice of all the good looking women. There isn't a single ugly woman in this movie. Scarlett Johansson is no exception. She is a Goddess. Everything in this movie is meant to look good.<br/><br/>To sum it all up: The Island isn't original in any way, and the story won't challenge you intellectually. The level of suspense is enough to keep you interested. The action is good. There is some humor. Last but not least it has the classic Michael Bay look and feel. It's slightly above average. It's worth the ticket, and you'll enjoy it as long as it lasts, but when you wake up the next morning, you'll have forgotten all about it."

","Normally, I'd provide a synopsis of the movie. However, I'm not willing to devote that much time to this flick. I expected an interesting spin on the debate over cloning with some cool action scenes thrown in for good measure. At least that's what the preview of the movie led me to believe. However, I left the theater extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>Part of what makes a movie intriguing for me is the air of plausibility in the midst of a fictional plot. The writers of the Island obviously don't share that view point. Among the wackiness we are supposed to buy into:<br/><br/>The clones are educated and mentally developed to the level of a teenager. However, they are taught nothing of sex so they have no sexual desire. Perhaps this is a subtle plug for abstinence crusaders. Uh maybe it is just me, but I could have sworn the teenage years were right around the time when hormones began their active period.<br/><br/>Men and women among the clones are prevented from getting too close one another to prevent any physical attractions,desires for sex to kick in. I guess the writers never saw an attractive person from across the room and became aroused.<br/><br/>People would pay millions to buy a clone of themselves but never actually see the clone.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the stupidity of this plot. However, that is more attention than this dud of a movie deserves. Skip it at the theater, avoid it in the bargain DVD bin, and by all means turn the channel when it hits cable TV."

Lincoln Six Zero is one of the workers in the facility and he is infatuated with Jordan Two Delta. His life is fairly uneventful and mundane until Jordan Two Delta gets selected to go to The Island. Then Lincoln starts to discover the truth about the facility and The Island.<br/><br/>Despite being a Michael Bay movie, this film looked promising. It was never that original - Logan's Run sprang immediately to mind just from the summary and the first few scenes - but had potential to at least go somewhere different.<br/><br/>However, very quickly the wheels fell off. While still having more substance than Bay's average movie, the plot was still lacking. Despite the 2 ¼ hour running time of the movie, the plot is fairly basic, just with a few hidden details to make it more interesting. Much of the film is filled with chase and action scenes, so Bay playing to his strengths. A bit less explosions than normal though, which is a plus, I guess.<br/><br/>So ultimately your average action-thriller."

","The Island is a story about an installation that houses clones. Clones that are purchased by (and bred for) society's rich and powerful. These clones are kept, in the installation, for insurance purposes. Insurance purposes you ask? It seems that the clones are being kept in the installation in case their ""sponsor"" needs a new heart, a new kidney, or just to breed a child for the sponsor. The clones are led to believe that they are rescued people from a world that has been ""contaminated"" and destroyed. This belief keeps the clones within the walls of the society and keeps them under control.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays Lincoln. Lincoln begins to start having nightmares and questioning his surroundings and the world. This starts the journey of discovery for Lincoln. Without revealing too much of the story, Lincoln finds out that the world is not what it seems. Lincoln escapes with his best friend (Scarlett Johannson) into the real world.<br/><br/>Sean Bean, who is just good at everything he does, plays the manager of the clone installation. Once Lincoln escapes, he sets a mercenary unit on the loose to recapture the clones.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I thought each of the three main stars were adequate. Bean was very good (as usual), McGregor is in fine form, and Johannson fits the bill as the female love interest. While the movie was entertaining, there is a flaw (of course) that may cause some people to lose interest: the mercs flying all over LA blowing everything up to recapture two escape clones. I found that a bit over the top. All these ex-SEALs running around (in broad daylight) blowing up vehicles, buildings, other people just to capture two lost clones. But while that was a bit ridiculous, the movie works. The movie promised to be a summer popcorn flick and it delivers.<br/><br/>Remember that most movies are ridiculous. But a good product can overshadow the over the top antics and still produce quality entertainment. If I had to rate this picture (scale of 10), I would have to say 7.5.<br/><br/>Besides Batman, this is the only worthwhile film thus far. In a summer of movies like Bewitched, The Island is a nice break in the idiotic and the stupid."

Yes, in the near future we may be able to clone our own individual body parts in a lab, which may do away with donors all together, but to grow a complete duplicate for harvesting is just plain ludicrous (especially in adult form in record time). <br/><br/>Besides the over-the-top cloning scenario, I love how the ""big brother"" administration failed with the ability to monitor their subjects once they entered the ""contamination zone.""

At least Logan's Run had some flesh showing and a bit of gratuitous nudity!!<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER:<br/><br/>The scene where Ewan McGregor ultimately destroys the city by basically pulling a lever that says 'Don't pull this lever' is reminiscent of an Austin Powers movie.<br/><br/>The possibilities of a thoughtful story about cloning are all but lost in the way it's treated.

You never really care about the characters. The script is amateurish. The special effects are recycled dregs from past action movies and were stagnant and old five years ago. This movie actually had potential but the director ruined it. The film was produced for eight year olds with attention deficit disorder. The plot barely sets up before the car crashes and chases begin. Go see something worthwhile. Pass this one by. Not worth your time or money.

It is a big Chrysler commercial."
"jhclues","9","12","27","23 July 2005"," Science Fiction At It's Best
","This movie, because it's a ""Summer, Sci-Fi/Action"" flick, will probably do extremely well at the box office, if for no other reason than the fact that Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are in the cast. Regrettably, however, even after it's been out for awhile it will probably never reach as wide and diverse an audience as it deserves until it's release on DVD, when-- hopefully-- positive word of mouth recommendations will lead those who usually avoid this particular genre to it. Because ""The Island,"" directed by Michael Bay, is a cautionary, thought-provoking tale set in the not-so-distant future that holds a mirror up to our current society and poses some serious questions about moral judgement and how unmitigated secrecy on the part of institutions and those we ""should"" be able to trust affects us all on a daily basis that is especially relevant in today's world.<br/><br/>The story concerns the survivors of a ""contamination"" who must dwell within a seemingly sterile, self-contained city where their happiness is paramount to those in charge, while at the same time their only hope for the future is to be the next lottery winner, which would afford them a one-way ticket to the last uncontaminated place on earth, The Island. And to tell it, director Bay, no stranger to action films with such offerings as ""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon"" and ""Bad Boys I&II"" under his belt, has drawn upon myriad other classics of the genre and used the collective threads to successfully weave his own story and imprint it with the kind of metaphor that elevates it beyond the next action sequence or explosion. A comparison to ""Logan's Run"" goes without question, along with an obvious nod to ""Blade Runner,"" a smattering of ""The Matrix"" and even a pinch of ""Star Wars."" Which is not to say this is a ""copy"" of any of those; it definitely is not. Bay has merely-- and wisely-- drawn upon some of the more successful elements of those films, and in most instances expanded upon them, to deliver a memorable film that far surpasses the genre's usual board of fare.<br/><br/>Arguably, this is Michael Bay's best overall film to date. Though he has demonstrated in the past that he knows how to do action, he has outdone even himself with this one. There is one heart-stopping scene, for example, involving a number of vehicles and helicopters that eclipses even the highly touted freeway sequence of the second ""Matrix"" film. The F/X are top notch, and once the action begins in earnest, he sets a pace that builds the excitement without allowing it to lay or lapse even for a second, right up to the very end. Add to that the fact that this film really has something to say, and it will make you appreciate what Bay and his company of actors and technicians have accomplished here even more.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is perfectly cast as Lincoln Six Echo, using his boyish charm, good looks and manner to lend the necessary credibility of innocence to his character. The charismatic Scarlett Johansson finds just the right note, as well, to bring her character, Jordan Two Delta, to life. Bay gives each of his actors, in turn, a moment in which to define their respective characters and underscore the plausibility of the film, and when that time comes they each succeed in a way that sustains the interest in the story beyond the action and the F/X. Excellent performances by both McGregor and Johansson.<br/><br/>In a supporting role, Steve Buscemi adds color to the proceedings as McCord, the man with the answers to a number of questions Lincoln Six has been asking about their environment and way of life; questions to which others in positions of authority respond with guarded circumspection, among them Merrick, one of the apparent caretakers of the city. Played by Sean Bean, Merrick is one of the pivotal characters of the film, and while Bean's performance is decent, it lacks the nuance that could have taken it to a much higher level. As it is, while effective to an extent, it is a fairly lackluster and generic portrayal.<br/><br/>The excellent supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Starkweather); Ethan Phillips (Jones Three Echo); Brian Stepanek (Gandu Three Echo); Noa Tishby (Community Announcer); and Siobhan Flynn (Lima One Alpha). For most, ""The Island"" will be an exciting summertime diversion; but for those who pay attention to the underlying social and political significance of the story, the rewards will most likely exceed any and all expectations. And that's the magic of the movies."

","About ten minutes into The Island, I realized what a mistake I had made. I should have never accepted the invitation to go to a free screening. It would have been time more well spent, if had come home from work and gotten some laundry done.<br/><br/>The film reminded me of the conceptual films of a bygone era, a la Soylent Green or A Clock Orange, although not really so well done. There were about one hundred too many car crashes and overly done attempts at representing the future with flying cycles and 2005 model-year cars. The word ""rediculous"" comes to mind.<br/><br/>Overall, this viewer was bored from wire to wire. I can't really hold the acting responsible. It was a poorly written script. When I think of all the talent going unpublished, it irks me that such bad writing can go so far."

","Did anyone see the movie, The Island? I know it was directed by Michael Bay who in the past has made action movie for Producer Jerry Bruckheimer but this movie was made away from MR Bruckheimer and it was some of the best work I've ever seen from Michael Bay. He really put thought into this movie and though it still has action it has a great story and characters. It is ten times better than that mess Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>Here is my problem...This movie was a box office failure in the states. Yet it is a hit overseas. Why!?! It should be a hit in the U.S. as well.<br/><br/>This was the best movie I've seen this year. It was exciting and different even though it had a lot of references to George Orwell's 1984, THX-1138 and Logans Run.<br/><br/>I really think people missed the big picture when they saw commercials for this film. It deserved a better chance at a wide release. It was only in a few theaters and I truly believe that studio heads did not give this one a chance.<br/><br/>It angers me when a good movies is overlooked. I hope DVD will give this movie new life.<br/><br/>A four star Movie"

A main character who questions his environment. 3. The video game fight scene. ( if I'm not mistaken the female won in both films) 4. They find a way outside and explore the real world while being pursued by adversary's who are assigned to terminate them or bring them back. 5.

"Victor Field","6","7","14","26 July 2005"," Maybe they should have just called it ""Lincoln's Run.""
","There's a moment in ""The Island"" when newly liberated clone Scarlett Johansson sees the original woman she's cloned from in a department store display, complete with a commercial starring her on TV. When she sees herself, it's supposed to be a poignant moment of recognition (well, according to the unsubtle Steve Jablonsky music playing), but since the display is for Calvin Klein - which the gorgeous Scarlett has shilled for in real life (and indeed it's her actual TV ad we see) - it falls short of impact, just coming across as a cheap gag. Plus the client's name is Sara Jordan.<br/><br/>Sara Jordan... Scarlett Johansson... get the idea?<br/><br/>This is, sadly, pretty typical of Michael Bay's first baby steps as a director outside of the Bruckheimerverse; the movie really wants to be a clever science-fiction exercise and a cracking action thriller, but while it's not really a disaster it still falls far short of the ""Total Recall""/""Minority Report"" league. Maybe it should have had a Philip K. Dick source rather than one by a man whose last major credit was the direct-to-video-in-the-UK Angelina Jolie movie ""Beyond Borders""; it's kind of like an inexperienced student trying to tackle a subject far beyond his reach - the movie tries but just doesn't have what it takes.<br/><br/>The script by Caspian Tredwell-Owen and the team of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci is derivative, for sure (especially ""Logan's Run"" - for Logan read Lincoln, for Jessica read Jordan, for Carousel read The Island, for the Elders read Sean Bean and the other staff, for Francis read the guy played by Djimon Hounsou, and so on), but what makes ""The Island"" really a letdown is that from time to time you get glimpses of what this could have been like. Every time Steve Buscemi is on screen it gets some life (until he's killed off, alas), and one wishes he could have been the star rather than Ewan McGregor; the movie also has some interesting ideas in its core when it's not flinging rapidly edited chases at you, and if it had managed to look at all the repercussions of clones it would have hit its high aspirations of being a popcorn movie with ideas.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the shallow characterisation makes that impossible, and ""The Island"" also sidesteps any potentially plot-crippling moral problems of humans and clones by making Young Obi-Wan's original a jerk (although since he himself admits he's not willing to die any more than the clone is, how does our hero have the moral high ground?) and having the pouting one's source material be in a coma (and be the mother of a young boy, and have her subplot more or less swept under the carpet in a sentence or two near the end). So that's all right then. (Incidentally, one female clone is killed after giving birth to the baby that the original client couldn't have; so artificial insemination doesn't exist at this time? And what about a less expensive form of surrogate motherhood? And if the original can't have children, what makes them think a clone would be any different?) <br/><br/>Always watchable but never exciting or compelling, ""The Island"" is ultimately not an improvement on Kurtzman & Orci's work on ""Alias"" and ""Xena: Warrior Princess,"" or even the ""Logan's Run"" TV series; it doesn't have even Scarlett Johansson in a minidress without a bra. (Dammit.) Michael Bay has yet to be the Robert Zemeckis to Jerry Bruckheimer's Steven Spielberg."

","The Island is a gripping movie and as much as you think about it you can't imagine how it could possibly end but when it does it is beautiful. Both Ewan McGregor and Scarlette Johansson play very believable roles as adult humans with the brain power of a 15 year old. But a few scenes are a little hard to watch as they involve human pain and show people being shot, stabbed or being forced to move their body's in an unnatural way but the movie is very touching. The plot is total genius i couldn't believe it as i was watching it. Michael Bay has really outdone himself with this one.

I would love to read the original. I would love to see what the writer intended, because the writer that wrote the first half of this flick did not write the second half.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is always filling scripts with action and deleting the story elements that make you think. During the car chase I was thinking, ""god do I have to laundry, when will I actually get to do it."" A good flick will not let your mind drift. It will present questions for the viewer and stick with you through the next day. After the this flick we reviewed it at subway, getting dinner and soon dismissed it. The potential this film had was great, and lost it in the Hollywood suffle. Ewan and Johansan are wonderful and so is the rest of the cast.

The movie is full of lady's legs. The technology of the future is a little screwed up in the movie as well. There are flying motorcycles but people are still driving magnums, vibes and nissans.

"Cazziewaffle","Null","4","7","16 August 2005"," Not your average action movie!
","Michael Bay's ""The Island"" seemed to be everything you'd expect from your average, typical, Hollywood type summer blockbuster the attractive actors, in this case, Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor; a hell of a lot of over-the-top action and a seemingly incoherent plot Definitely your typical cheesy-type popcorn blockbuster! But, is that really all there is to this movie? <br/><br/>Set in the not-so-far future, the year 2019, the world, as we know it, has apparently been contaminated and all the survivors are kept in a carefully controlled, contamination-free environment. The only thing keeping any of them going is the idea that they maybe chosen to be sent to ""The Island"", the last contamination free zone on the planet. Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) questions his existence, and rightly so, as he discovers that they're all actually human clones, and he escapes taking his best friend Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson) with him, and they run for their lives as they are pursued by the scientists behind their existence.<br/><br/>Compared to other not-so-great Michael Bay movies such as ""Armageddon"" (you can't get a more typical Hollywood summer blockbuster!) and ""Pearl Harbor"" (ok, I wouldn't really call that your typical action movie, but it's definitely typically Hollywood!), ""The Island"" is actually quite good.<br/><br/>For one, they seemed to put more effort into the story. Yes it is set in the future, but only 14 years ahead so they could have some futuristic elements (some awesome looking trains and your expected advanced technology) but it was nicely mixed with the present day, so it wasn't too far detached from the world as we know it, which made the whole prospect seem a lot more real and actually quite unsettling. And they threw some interesting thoughts of morality in them, which helps edge the film towards being thought provoking! <br/><br/>The cast do well in their parts. Better than expected, as I never really expect anything from actors in action movies. But it does help that you have a cast that have proved to actually be able to act slightly better than your average actor. McGregor and Johansson had the chemistry needed, and they definitely could hold the film. But the supporting cast definitely stood out too. Steve Buscemi was great at giving the comic relief needed; Sean Bean was extremely convincing as the sinister scientist behind it all, and Djimon Hounsou brings some unexpected depth to his character, the guy hunting the clones. In fact, all the cast bring some depth to their characters, which I found unexpected and refreshing to see in an action movie.<br/><br/>The action was your usual over-the-top action; car chases, explosions, and stunts you can't believe anyone survives. It's nothing you haven't seen before, and these were the parts in which the movie dragged and definitely helped make it your average action movie.<br/><br/>So, for once, it was the story and the cast that made the movie more interesting and not a complete waste of your time! I'd say see it if you're a big fan of the action, and if you like sci-fi.. or if you'd just like to see an above average action movie!"
"dragon_x","9","4","7","24 July 2005"," The Island is a sea of islands ...
","Is this the last inhabitable island? A paradise for the lucky few lottery winners?<br/><br/>While one may think this is a rip off on some sub part 70's B flick, I get the feeling this is a segway from Logan's Run, THX 1138 and others. The cast is good, the script is good ... along with the story (important) though some action scenes will stretch (and maybe break?) your belief, these transgressions are minor. All action movies have 'reality' issues.<br/><br/>I suppose it is fashionable to bash Micheal Bay. I never really paid attention - but I guess, because of the Pearl Harbor disaster (the film with Ben Afleck, not the actual events from December 7th), people have a deep seated hatred for the director. This hatred is seemingly enhanced by the number of explosions that Bay uses in some of his movies.<br/><br/>I think The Island (TI) got a bad rap for product placement. I think this is mostly undeserved. I did think the XBox (live people fighting) was badly placed... it just seemed silly, but other 'placements' seemed very natural - or even funny in a good way. And this leads to the car chase (or one of them). It was much better than the Matrix 2 car chase where all cars seemed to be of a new GM origin and the only cool car was the Camaro (also of GM origin, but at least it had SOME originality). Of course the ads in the movie theater can get annoying ... but that's nothing to do with the movie.<br/><br/>I think Bay & Co did a very good job of setting the scene and showing us the human qualities of Jordan and Lincoln. In many ways they seemed more human than the others. Many big questions are raised by this movie and I think many statements are made about the human condition and what people will do to stay alive. How did Lincoln Six Echo develop memories from another person? What kind of influence did the tech/ McCord (played by Steve Buscemi) have on Lincoln. Merrick (Sean Bean) brings up this point, but I think his lack of a real answer makes a bigger statement than anything else.<br/><br/>What is real and what is human? What is the nobility of the human spirit ... While these questions are different for everyone I think they are important and should have answers. This movie gives many answers and leaves the right questions.<br/><br/>The dialog in TI is good, the actors are good, Scarlet is hot and did well with her role ... I've seen this once and I give it a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>I would go into this movie with as little knowledge about TI, as possible. I would ignore jaded reviewers (professionals who get PAID to review!) who get fussy at the oddest things. I would also ignore the 15 year old retards (is that redundant?) who fail understand that all these ideas are in the public domain and DIRECTORS do not plagiarize (unless they are writers!). I doubt any real 15 year old would get off the Island alive! Maybe the only smart ones are Lincoln & Jordan...<br/><br/>MB did a good job. It has a nice build up and then the action is well paced with enough of the old to make the differences stand on their own."
"MisterAverageGuy","5","4","7","24 July 2005"," THX 1138 meets Coma '78
","Didn't George Lucas do this one back in his college days? It didn't entertain much then, doesn't do much better in this re-do. A real let down considering Michael Bay's history. Maybe the studio was trying to squeeze a few extra bucks out of the Armageddon and Rock guy. Could have been cut 30 minutes and wouldn't have noticed. Starts off well but fades, tempo jumps too much starting about halfway through. Went from rotating long shots of our heroes after escaping the facility to jerky ""action"" shots (for that simulator feel) then half-speed to milk the car flips and explosions, a couple of which were original. I'm going to assume Bruckhiemer may have suggested getting them out of the box earlier, with a few friends in tow, to spend more time learning what the ""real"" world and people are like. This would have given it less of a THX 1138 feel and seemed more plausible later at the end of the film. Michael Clark Duncan was used way too sparingly as the token black guy. Sorry, but the message seems to be if you're black in the future you're still only rich if you're a pro-sports guy. Seeing Neelix (Ethan Phillips) without the Mohawk and makeup was interesting, he's a pretty good actor when he has good dialog. Steve Buscemi would have been good to have around a while longer too. The ""mail-order"" clothing gag could have been milked a little more. How about Scarlett and Ewan with a' la Family Guy Lois and Peter (i.e.; ""the safety word is ""). Let's not forget the product placement; you know the pseudo- subliminal advertising in movies. Hey it's the bleeding ""Mid-21st Century"" why are Microsoft, Johnny Rockets, Puma, MSN, Cadillac, Calvin Klein, etc., etc. still using the same old Logos? Have advertisers in the future run out of new ideas too? Microqsuish seems to have a new one every few years? Over all the cast did a great job keeping their characters believable but the action at times was borderline laughable. The high point being a 60 story fall holding onto a giant letter R (Reebok must have pulled out late in production) which happens to fall on top of the helicopter that's suppose to be shooting DOWN at them. Then the logo smashes through scaffolding before hanging up in a safety net designed to hold people not several thousand pounds of steel. Oh and then the obligatory ""love"" scene near the end of the movie just in case you missed the affections Ewan and Scarlett made clear earlier with their acting. Look for the ""R-rated"" scenes most certainly to show- up on the second ""Directors Cut"" DVD (more corporate dribble). The only redeeming message seems to be that somewhere in the future that open borders thing in California seemed to get fixed. Either that or the now rich Hispanics go back to Mexico and South America and overthrow their corrupt governments and find a way restore their economies. One final note, the flying jet bikes were kewl."
"FlickerDreams","2","7","15","27 July 2005"," The shameless product placement ruins the movie!
","I actually like the idea of this story a great deal. But in true Michael Bay style it was destroyed. There are many reasons why this movie didn't work overall but the worst of it is the ridiculous product placement. When are the people that make these decisions going to realize that we the audience want to get lost in a story? When will they understand that these stupid shots that are stuck in to promote a product we all know about anyway just pull us right out of the moment and reminds us we are watching a movie, and a bad one at that? At least if we could lose ourselves the movie may have stood a chance. I've never seen product placement this bad before. I wish Bay would stick to making commercials."

I have rarely seen a big Hollywood movie flaunt it's conservative agenda so blatantly (other than the Passion of Christ). Bay takes these issues to exaggerated conclusions that I am sure conservative America will just eat up. I guess everyone has a right to make whatever movies they want and people can also exercise their right to not see a particular movie (thankfully I had a pass and did not pay to see this) We already know the twisted way conservative America thinks, if you don't want to pay to see it on screen, I recommend you skip it."

","This ""film"" is full of non-stop product placements. The ""action"" scenes consist of a close up shot of, who knows what, with the camera shaking relentlessly. <br/><br/>I must give Bay credit however, because it is obvious that he basically made up the whole movie himself as he went along. His visual style is incredible, if only he would stop cutting every millisecond. The cinematography, especially of Scarlett Johannsen is unbelievable. She looks candy-colored. The contrast of the film every time she is shown is amazing, and the natural lighting is a breath of fresh air. We can see shadows on their faces!<br/><br/>There is no chance in hell there was ever a full script for this version of the movie. It seems as if Steve Buschemi's lines were the only ones that they bothered to write down on paper and the rest they made up. The pacing of the film is atrocious. Compare this to even the mediocre film ""Minority Report."" At least that film got the viewer into the story with a great opening sequence. The only decent thing about this film is the pro-life and nature vs. nurture messages it forces you to think about in between boring scenes. Also, the white suits shot from above remind me of sperm, and many of the clones are shown in embryo like sacks, violently being cut upon. Much like abortion. The character ""motivations"" are absolutely laughable. <br/><br/>Michael Bay should be ashamed at the way he uses black people in this film. In the extremely unfunny first act, black women and men are used to make ""funny"" sassy sarcastic jokes. After having a black villain, played by Djimon Hundsou chase down the two leads with black helicopters, fire at them with machine guns relentlessly, and lead groups of men in the process of destroying the city of los angeles, he suddenly becomes a ""good"" guy. He turns against his employers and decides to help liberate the clones.<br/><br/>There is a character who seems to be an overacting Canadian actor hamming it up. He seems to be comic relief, but we all sat through his scenes stone faced. There is one scene where he enters a gas chamber, and panics. Needless to say, it was the best part of the movie. This character IS the movie. When you see him, you understand the tone and the mental age of the script. I remember being 10 years old. This movie was made for eight year olds.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a perfect example of how Hollywood can throw in a bunch of computer graphics and a horrible script and still wonder why they are losing money."

"gus120970","3","5","10","12 April 2007"," Marooned on a sea of superficiality
","The Island reinforces just how bad a film director Michael Bay can be. The previous low water mark was his ability to turn the most traumatic and emotive event in American history (the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbour) into a three hour snoozefest.<br/><br/>The Island is not anywhere near as soporific, but is deeply banal. Somewhere deep in its core there is an interesting sci-fi idea and perhaps even an ethical dilemma to be addressed. But its smothered under endless pop-video stylings, an insipid screenplay, interminable and overblown action sequences and actors struggling to offer performances and create characters in the director's entirely two-dimensional universe.<br/><br/>Bay is the apotheosis of the bad director, the prime role in the malign ecosystem of American cinema with bad films being created to feed the appetite of audiences conditioned to bad, but expensive movies. The tradition of the blockbuster began in the 1970s, when the movies retained some measure of substance and the director's were somewhat talented and idealistic. 'Product' like The Island can only be the product of cynical, tired and unchallenged minds. Having said all that, the film had as bad a run at the American box office as everywhere else, so perhaps audiences retain a modicum of good taste.<br/><br/>The product placement begins almost before the initial credits have rolled as Lincoln Six Echo rummages around for his missing Puma tennis shoe. We see he appears to be living in the near future in a post-apocalyptic refuge which appears to be a hybrid of a David Lloyd health Club and a city centre shopping mall.<br/><br/>Inmates are subject to dietary, exercise and strict no touching rules, ostensibly for their own health but, as eventually revealed, because they are nothing more than organ donors to be harvested for rich clients as required.<br/><br/>That's the interesting bit over with. Inevitably, they are able to escape about half way through the movie (the envy) to find they are actually living in a bunker somewhere in the desert and a short maglev train ride to L.A. Why maglev trains stop at one-horse desert towns is not made clear. Whatever the explanation, it's more plausible than the idea that an industrial holocaust on this scale could go undetected whilst apparently staffed casually by locals.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is a series of very long, headache- inducing action sequences which, predictably, the pair survive. Ewan McGregor also has a narcissistic episode when meeting his clone double - an opportunity the film can't be bothered to make more of. I have no issues with action movies, but can I have a bun with my burger? The ending requires, of course, that the whole dystopian edifice is torn down, providing another FX extravaganza. Personally, I thought the whole model-based sequence for Logan's Run in 1976 was more interesting to look at.<br/><br/>The Island steals heavily from Logan's Run, and THX 1138 and is in many ways as much a pastiche of movie dystopian features as it is a rehash of the style used by Bay in previous movies.<br/><br/>And there is no Island. It's just an illusion."

"kgprophet","4","5","10","25 July 2005"," Nothing New
","Michael Bay is a great TV commercial director. He keeps the camera moving, putting lovely models in front of glitzy backdrops. I wouldn't quite go as far as saying Michael Bay is a good action movie director. Action movies get energy from quick cuts and a moving camera, but there needs to be a coherency to all the mayhem. This film feels like retread all the way. ""The Island"" is a remake of ""Logan's Run"" in the Blade Runner-esquire Los Angeles (but now with sunny skies!). I like Ewan McGregor sure, but he's not given enough depth to create any attachment. Ditto for Johansson the Airhead, For some of the machinations of the plot to succeed, not only did the logic of the story get dumbed down, but so did our main characters. Once again, great for a 30 second spot to sell a car, but not workable in a 2 hour timeframe. <br/><br/>So it's going through the motions of the discovery that we can easily guess. There are a couple nice set pieces when we see the whole cloning technology, and implanting memories. My hopes were on something slick and well staged when all the whizzing cars and explosions took over in the third act, but it was so bad as to be goofy. Ladies and Gentlemen, you are reduced to big loud signs planted on nearby Holograph Generators, with dozens of Danger and Hazardous signs. And just in case you STILL don't get the big explosion coming up, you have a ""Do Not Press This Button - Generator Will Be Destroyed"" sign plastered right on the machine. This deflated the whole works to the level of the old Batman TV Shows. But Bay had to tame his vision to under 120 million, and you see the difference when compared to the meta-blockbusters of ""Armageddon"" (200M) and ""Pearl Harbor"" (140+M). You get a ridiculous 'action' scene where our heroes slide down alongside a stairway, made all exciting by simply shaking the camera back and forth. I think the shaky cam is way overdone these days, (see my review of ""Bourne Supremacy""). This is ultimately what kills the movie, all the action scenes are pure hokum. The CGI air cycles you couldn't buy for a second. The car chase scenes had no direction, it was just aimless cars flipping and exploding ad nauseam. Once again, I am willing to credit Michael Bay's previous films, putting some huge action pieces on the screen. I will still pull out my cable copy of ""Pearl Harbor"" once in a while and fast forward to the attack scenes. <br/><br/>So that's it, a medium budget sci-fi retread with no A-list actors and nothing really new to offer. You can only hold our attention so long with flashing lights and spastic camera-work, until the thin plot makes you groan. More groans abound as you see commercial logos parade in front of the camera every ten minutes or so. My guess is that Bay was going after the quintessential ""Blade Runner"" future world Christopher Nolan was also going after in ""Batman Begins"". But there was no striking vision in this future world, and instead he created a mish-mosh of today, near future, and manufactured future that fails to excite. These is no resonance of a deeper philosophy, which comes belated and through the most unbelievable bad-guy-turns-good moment. Truthfully, ""Revenge of the Sith"" stands as the most spectacular CGI effect film of all time, and nothing released this summer will measure up in that respect (although McGregor is allowed to expand his acting talents a bit)."
"MadWatch","4","5","10","25 July 2005"," Decent movie spoiled by glaring nitpicks
","NOTE: Spoilers galore in this post.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed with this movie. I was expecting a decent science fiction movie, instead I got a hacked up attempt at a sci-fi action/romance combination, with too many large nitpicks that it spoiled the experience.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straight forward. A group of people live in isolation after being told that they are the survivors of some global catastrophe. They a mundane, but secure and physically fit life with promises that they will one day go to The Island, the last Utopian location on the planet. The main character, Lincoln-6-Echo, discovers the horrible truth; the people are in some kind of prison and everything they've been told is a lie. Eventually he escapes with Jordan-2-Delta and they discover that they are really clones of people in the ""real world"" that use the clones for body parts. They escape are on the run, then eventually return to free the other clones.<br/><br/>The movie overall was good, it just had too many plot problem that just nagged on me enough to spoil the movie in general:<br/><br/>1) The 2 fugitives escape from the compound with relative ease. Where is the security? How come they are able to walk down a long access bridge to freedom with NO ONE spotting them? They already fought security guards; no one is able to keep tabs on their position? 2) The main characters supposedly have the education of 15 year olds and they supposedly have almost NO knowledge of the ""real world"". Yet once they get to a train station and then to Los Angeles, they don't seem to have any problems getting around. I mean, they act stupid and don't know phrases like ""the can"", ""taking a dump"", ""dude"" and act incredulous around this. Yet they don't seem to have a problem navigating around a metropolis, which to them would be an alien environment. 3) The main characters get by with 5 movies worth of luck. They dodge trained military personnel. Survive drops from a skyscraper hundreds of feet in the air and manage to take out a helicopter while doing so. They are in a car when it gets totaled (cut in half!!) after getting side-swiped by an armored truck and walk away, not even dazed. I found it hard to empathize with the characters when they were in ""danger"" because they seemed to be invulnerable! 4) Clones with memories. This is a pet peeve of mine. Memories are NOT a part of a creatures DNA structure. A clone is simply a copy of a creatures physical make up. It cannot have the experience and memories of its donor, because the clone itself hasn't had those experiences or memories. Yet movies frequently portray a clone as not only having the same physical properties as a donor, but the same memories as well. Although, in this movie, the memories were mostly ""subconscious"". 5) When Jordan was brought back to the institution towards the end, NO ONE thought to search her for a weapon?!! 6) During some of the big action scenes (fighting with the guards while escaping and the big highway chase scene with the flying attack bikes) the camera kept shaking and it was hard to see what the heck was going on. Whats the point of seeing a movie, when the movie *itself* makes it difficult to see what is on the screen?!<br/><br/>As the movie went on, these issues just keep accumulating until by the end, I just wanted to see the end.<br/><br/>As a side note, I noticed that this movie was almost identical to merging together two other movies: Logans Run and Freejack. The movie has a man and a woman on the run, leaving an isolated society and encountering the world outside, only to return and ""free"" the people from the society (Logans Run). Meanwhile, they are on the run and hunted down by mercenaries, because their bodies are actually owned by some rich person (Freejack).<br/><br/>Overall, I give the movie a 4 out of 10. I would give the movie a 7 out of 10 for just the story, but this is reduced for the annoying issues I mentioned previously."

","this movie took me by surprise, i got tickets to the premiere, and went for the reason it was free, also i like Ewan. anyhow, the story reminded me a little of the brave new world. the whole futuristic theme. it was very interesting, and the whole scientific aspect was very much appealing. then they took the whole concept of cloning and whether it is ethical, and what would happen if we actually had clones. scarlet Johansen was very pretty and she acted pretty well. Ewan did an awesome double role. the movie was entertaining, educating, made one think of what could happen and what is happening in the world today; also it was thrilling and action packed. although i think they held off on a lot of the possible blood shed. the bar scene was hilarious, and so was the peeing scene in the beginning. something i found quite astounding was the fact that Jordan and Lincoln fell down from the top of a building and they weren't hurt at all, they had a lot of close calls, but nothing ever happened. why? Hollywood i guess. the concept was fun, reminds one of lab rats. except these were clones of human beings living in a perfect bubble. if we were maintained like them wow, we would be so fit and perfect. something out of the x-files, but still thoroughly entertaining, a little slow at first. and really shows, that nature always breaks through!"

","Having just watched ""The Island"" for the first time, I have to say it is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. I found the plot to be very similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""The 6th Day,"" although ""Island"" far surpasses its mediocre twin. <br/><br/>A cloning company that sells ""insurance policies"" to rich people (the Sponsors) to add 70 years onto their life has human clones believing there was a worldwide contamination that rendered the world uninhabitable, and their only hope of happiness is winning the ""Lottery"" and leaving the containment area to go live in peace on the Island, which doesn't actually exist, in reality, they are taken to be killed, and their organs removed to be used when their Sponsors need surgery.<br/><br/>This movie captured my attention instantly and didn't let go until the end credits rolled. Unlike many movies of its kind, the plot was not terribly complicated, and I followed it easily. Great action sequences, particularly the chase scene where Lincoln rolls the giant iron reels off the semi and takes out the entire force chasing them.

"tburke85","7","3","5","11 June 2009"," The Island A Decent Sc-Fi Film But Overlong
","The Island is a decent sci-film but overlong from director Michael Bay who seems to have a hate/love relationship with critics and audiences. I think he's a talented filmmaker some of his past films may not have been the greatest but he does show a lot skill in all of them none the less including this one. The cast for the most part are admirable in their roles including Ewan McGregor, Scarlet Johannson, Dijmin Honsou, and Sean Bean. McGregor and Johannson are effective as the leads bringing credibility to the characters and their situation. Honsou and Bean make for solid bad guys. They may lack development and screen time but both of them make the best of their roles as the villains. Steve Buscemi shows up for a brief role and does add some comic relief to the film but his part is cut rather short. The same can go for Michael Clarke Duncan makes a cameo appearance and then disappears for the rest of the film but he still does an okay job with his small part. The rest of the cast are good in their limited screen time but aren't really developed. The action sequences are well executed and intense most of them happening toward the second half but some aren't very realistic while others are missing that WOW factor that you get occasionally when watching these kind of films. Besides the cool special effects the movie does have plenty of humor that balances well between the action, drama, and suspense. The film was a little slow especially in the beginning before the action really starts to kick in and it felt a bit overlong but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Despite it's few problems The Island is still an entertaining sci-fi adventure that may be a bit long but it keeps your attention because of the intense action, suspense, and equally impressive performances by most of the cast who make the movie worth watching at least once."
"dwmurphy85","10","3","5","2 January 2007"," best futuristic movie ever made
","Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen, perhaps the best!! The story is great, it starts with a very weird setting where you understand absolutely nothing of where it takes place and what's going on and then everything comes clear and the adventure begins. All the mechanisms invented in this movie are outstanding, exactly as it could be if this future would ever come true and it under lights a very dark aspect of human nature, in this sense it's very realistic. The action is great, absolutely the best I've ever seen, the picture, video and audio are perfect, it's I think the best production ever made, perfect in everything!! The performances of the actors are high class indeed, I don't know how Ewan Mcgregor being from Scotland can imitate so well the American accent, Scarlett Johansson very good looking and definitely up to the role she's been assigned, Sean Bean always great as the bad guy and Djimon Hounsou came quite well as the cool guy(definitely his part!!). Not a film to miss, if you never saw it I highly advise you to watch it, even if you wouldn't like it that much it has a moral that in my opinion has to be transmitted to everyone. Of course it is very exaggerated and a series of events like these would never happen in real life, but like I always say, if you don't see things like these in movies, where else would you!!??"
"Quinoa1984","5","3","5","26 August 2006"," at best it's sort of watchable as a preposterous sci-fi movie, at worst, well, Michael Bay IS the director...
","The Island is at least a partial remake of any given number of science fiction movies (among those referenced have been Logan's Run, Clonus, THX, and even the Truman Show), and it owes something to the preposterous science fiction movies of the 1950s where characters are one-dimensional, the storyline is fairly easily readable if you're into the genre, and it's got a lot of turn-off-your-mind action. So being in the 21st century and in a HUGE production mounted by Armageddon/Pearl Harbor gunner Michael Bay, what the Island is and what its content holds and how its done is not lost on me. In fact, it's not even really a 'bad' movie, though at one point about 90 minutes in I had to say to myself ""this is one stupid movie"". Because The Island tries for the thought provoking measures of say THX 1138 and The Truman Show, by taking the clone side of the picture in the stem-cell debate (is it ethical to create life to save others only to destroy the 'spare parts') in the future. But even in the first half and a bit in the second half of the movie, as it tires to dig into the subject matter and be smarter than just a humongous summer action movie that can possibly leave you a few IQ points lower, there's an empty quality to it too. What can be said except it's Michael Bay doing what he does.<br/><br/>So, it's really just a big B-movie that's masqueraded with 100 million+, two really good-looking stars (McGregor and Johannsen), and even a couple of excellent actors either underused (Buscemi, in maybe five minutes of the movie) or one-sided to the point of inertia (Sean Bean as the 'God' of the Echoes and Jordans and so on). McGregor's character starts off having weird dreams, investigates around the area, and finds out his fellow 'people' are just shells used for spare parts. He gets Johannsen out with him into the real world, chased my a mercenary (Djimon Hounsu, not given much else to do but look stoic and give out orders in yelling form). It leads to, naturally a scene between TWO McGregors on camera, and the kind of scene where the two of them, at gunpoint, have to tell the hunters ""I'M LINCOLN!"" ""NO, I'M LINCOLN!"" Which is around where I said the 'stupid' line.<br/><br/>At the end of the Island, I knew it was the kind of movie, as well, that I could recommend to some and not to others. If you're looking for something to which Michael Bay has a kind of near auteur-like knack of doing- big chases, explosions, car crashes, large, sweeping camera shots across terrains, and editing fast enough and photography quick and shiny enough to leave your eyes dizzy, this is just the ticket. That it has inklings of satire about the current state of science, albeit rather simplistic and not as probing like with THX or Truman Show, might strike the fans fancy. But if you're more of a serious science fiction movie fan, not really up for Bay's brand of cinematic whiplash action f***-off movie-making, it might be a slightly arduous experience. From one who's seen Bay movies that are decent (The Rock) and wretched (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor), it's possibly somewhere in the middle. Sometimes pretentious, sometimes fun, a kind of polished, glistening throwback to other movies and books. Overall, it's hit and miss."
"vertigo_14","5","3","5","31 March 2006"," Like an unofficial remake of Logan's Run. (spoilers)
","This movie was a huge financial undertaking that was really panned by critics and viewers when it was released in 2005. Part of the criticisms, I remember, being about Scarlett Johannsen going Hollywood (and looking so strange here, she so closely resembles Danielle Fischelle or a blonde Yasmine Bleeth), the blatant (and numerous) product placements, and, at least my criticism--making a movie that pieces together, in almost identical visual, thematic, or narrative form, great science fiction films of the past.<br/><br/>The Island is a story most fondly reminiscent of the great 1970s science fiction tale, Logan's Run (also on the Hollywood radar for a remake, although this takes care of it). It is the story of a hybrid colony of clones (the setting is more like an upscale gym) who are not aware of their existence. As is the key to most science fiction oddity, they are being bred for a corporate experiment designed to, at least initially, allow wealthy people live much longer. When their health fails in any way, the ailing part can be replaced with, of course, their clone.<br/><br/>Like the replicants in Blade Runner (another science fiction great from which the Island is largely derivative of), the clones are unaware of their existence as anything other than normally functioning humans. They have memories of a past prior to life in the colony which they forced onto after the ""contamination"" occurred. At first, it sounds like radiation contamination from post-nuclear warfare, but it isn't. Like the false promise of life renewal in Logan's Run, those in the colony participate in a lottery to travel to the ""Island."" One of the clones, unsure about certain conditions of which he is living, begins to investigate things around the colony and soon enough, it takes both he and another clone outside of the colony where he sees a world he had never even known existed. Meanwhile, with the escape the corporation is scrambling to retrieve the clones, hiring of course, the slickest hit-man who's skills may well help keep a lid on all the of laws being broken in the colony.<br/><br/>Despite being derivative (especially visually) of so many notable action films like Mad Max 3, Terminator 2, A.I., the Matrix 2, the Fifth Element, Gattaca, and even the Truman Show, this film does offer some interesting elements of its own. Although, the narrative is almost taken for routine, with very little elements changing beyond the films already mentioned. It is nearly as predictable from beginning to end. But, it does offer, at least, a somewhat entertaining almost-two hour glimpse into this sci-fi adventure, doing so with many great action sequences and, thanks to some good writing here and there, a bit of sly humor from time to time (especially from co-star Steve Buscemi). I'm sure the draw of the film, more than anything else, will be the cast, who have gotten dolled up just a little more than usual for the occasion."

","I saw this movie despite a respected critic panning it. What I found was a wonderful but somewhat frightening world presented, remarkably like our own real-world existence. Where liars & cheats have often taken up the highest positions of power & prestige, yet seem to often have their power & prestige by deception of those around them. They mislead & deprive the broader populace with remarkable success thanks to their treachery & the trust of others loyal or indifferent, that they exploit. They are aided in their quest by the apathy of the broader world's peoples, individually indifferent to the plight or suffering of others, as long as they are not personally suffering.<br/><br/>Yet as this thoughtful movie production presents, the world at large is, time & again unexpectedly the victim of its own misplaced trust. Mostly with no time or opportunity to complain or correct or communicate their suffering, without tragedy or death that may be nothing to do with the victims themselves. As such, it is a reminder of holocaust type worlds in history, of wars fought in the name of unjust causes & propaganda nothing to do with the reality of situations they claim to speak of with such words as ""freedom"".<br/><br/>The Island, as presented in the movie is indeed a Utopian concept, but one that is merely an illusion to defraud, both the clones in their netherworld & those who think they have bought their freedom to extended life in their material world of the rich & privileged. As such, it typified too the modern world of science in mindless experiments, at suffering to victims that they are apathetic of. Yet too, the governments & churches of this world, Christian or otherwise, each often have their own agendas far from the good of the broader populace they claim to represent or fight for.<br/><br/>As such, the police can be an enemy of a multinational-type corporation who claim to represent its clients, yet this company considers itself free to spy on or exterminate even clients, paying lip service to truth & justice along the way, merely giving its victims a false but temporary sense of security. They have tools to make themselves look like police with interchangeable labels & highly coordinated operations benefiting no one but themselves. They have uniforms & powers to control or operate to kill by such hierarchy of authority, while they exploit & abuse the trust of those that obey them. By contrast, they betray & kill without conscience. Their view of the ultimate evil in a human victim is to ""question"". So finally, by a worldly voice who dares to help the protagonists, the simple but sad reality of his message is ""Trust no one!"" While at times, this movie is a little far-fetched in some of its action sequences, it has so much going for it in its modern day 'David & Goliath' style battle for justice & truth & integrity against all odds! Look past its minor flaws & dare to look into a bleak world that is sadly very close to reality of today, then go back to the world around you with your eyes open, to its dangers on the one hand, to love & trust & friendship & justice on the other."

","""The Island"" was not always on my ""must-see"" list, but rather on my ""get away from it"" list. After seeing it, I was very happy I did. The acting is good, with a good and original storyline for an action movie, and it is directed by a veteran of the business in Michael Bay. First off, the action scenes are downright awesome. From a gigantic letter on a building crashing to the streets, to a futuristic motorcycle chase, to some pretty crazy gunfight scenes, ""The Island"" is a thriller that will surely entertain you.<br/><br/>Golden Globe Nominee Ewan McGregor (Star Wars: Episodes I, II, and III) and Golden Globe Nominee Scarlett Johansson (In Good Company) star as the hero and heroine of the story, with some funny supporting help from Steve Buscemi (Monsters, Inc.; Billy Madison), and some assistance at the end from Oscar Nominee Djimon Housou (Constantine; Amistad). The opposing character is played by Sean Bean (Flightplan, National Treasure), who is great as always. McGregor's only fault is that he doesn't hide his Scottish accent too well, and it sort of downplays the comedy of the scene where he encounters himself, but with an accent. Johansson's only job in the movie is to look good and say cool one liners, but she does that first one great. Buscemi is funny, and Hounsou is a real bad a**, if you know what I mean. The film is directed by Michael Bay, who proves that he can definitely take on a project like this. Viewers beware, if you get lost in plots of movies easily, you should stay away, because it can be very confusing. That's why I'm not going to bother to explain the plot, because it would take too long. In a nutshell, this is it: Two people (McGregor & Johansson) find out that they are clones of real people out in the real world, which they don't know exists, for their director (Sean Bean) keeps them in a military bunker underground. Their purpose is to serve as a sort of...insurance policy, as we're told many times throughout. McGregor's real world counterpart is an architect, while Johansson's is an actress/model (the real world counterparts are played by the same actors).<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Island"" is a great ride that you'll enjoy from start to finish, which is a long time. This movie is on the long side, but it needs to be for the plot.

","I watched both Mr and Mrs Smith and The Island this weekend and checked on Rotten tomatoes and found that smith got a whooping 60% and this movie 40%!!!!! THAT shows you how much critics know! IT REALLY needs to be the other way around! <br/><br/>The main actors did an excellent job and great acting from both the leads. The plot and script was laid out to keep you interested and the mix of action and plot was just about right.<br/><br/>I liked that the main actors are not BIG Hollywood names. I am SOOOooo SICk of seeing the SAME lame actors over and over again! So it was really refreshing to see a few 'newer' faces.<br/><br/>The plot was interesting, nothing super mind blowing but good.<br/><br/>I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good action film!"
"NeuroticMovieLover","9","3","5","30 December 2005"," The Only Michael Bay Film I Enjoyed
","Warning!! Spoilers!!! This movie was simply one of the most entertaining action films I've seen since Matrix first appeared. The whole cloning aspect playing off the recent controversy with stem-cell research gives this excellent movie some depth, which most action films lack. Ewan and Scarlett were amazing as usual and quite underrated as usual. The only major errors in this film are its title and lack of good advertising. Its a bad idea to name a movie after something that doesn't exist no matter how philosophically or romantically sophisticated it sounds. And the fact that you fed the audience the entire plot in the trailers was not a good move either: people who think their in utopia find out they're in a dystopian cloning facility and escape and run around in some metropolis that looks like downtown L.A., creating havoc everywhere they go. I loved the highway scene with the falling train wheels, but the whole scenario seemed a bit too matrix-esquire. Nevertheless, this was a great film by an, otherwise, action-addicted director."
"darketernal","8","3","5","29 December 2005"," A full-on action movie
","Coming into this movie, one has to realize that this is not going to be a huge psychological film, playing on characters' emotions to further the story, and it's not a big story driven thing. It's a Michael Bay production. Yeah, it's got massive explosions. It's got car chase sequences. It's an action movie. It's not going to teach anyone anything from it, but it is going to thoroughly impress after it's over.<br/><br/>Usually, the thing missing from most action movies is a plot. One thing that I was impressed by was how much story this movie had and how well all the action fit into the story, making a somewhat cohesive film out of it. I assume that some of that is simply playing to my love of science-fiction, but I still remembered the story after I left the movie theatre. There are some very big holes in it, sure, and these glaring omissions are a huge detriment, but nothing that I couldn't overlook in favor of the huge explosions covering them up.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very entertained by this movie. Not on a highly intellectual level, mind you, but still very entertained. The escape scene was one of the best action scenes of all, in my opinion. An amazing action movie. BOOM! Awesome."
"Robert_duder","9","3","5","28 December 2005"," A blast of an action movie!!
","The Island looked great right from square one...to me anyways. And then I started hearing all the negative reviews and even the cast was shunning the movie and the makers of the movie were blaming the cast for the poor turn out...I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm glad I gave it a chance because The Island turned out to be a great action, sci-fi film in the same vein as Total Recall or other great futuristic action films. Michael Bay is no stranger to the action genre. He has created some of the biggest and best action thrillers. As far as I am concerned The Island continues his tradition of greatness.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor stars as Lincoln Six Echo who appears to be trapped in a fortified underground city that protects survivors from a deadly breakout that wiped out humanity. As it turns out none of this is true and instead Dr. Merrick has created thousands of clones for the rich in order to save them when they need medical help. McGregor plays naive very well and although I'm not usually a fan of his, he does a decent job. He makes a great hero and he's easy to root for and his performance is well done. The heroine of the story is played by Scarlett Johansson who also I am not usually a fan of but for the first time really enjoyed her performance as fellow clone Jordan Two Delta. McGregor and Johansson's chemistry is quite good together and they make a great action team on top of that. The rest of the cast is also well placed including veteran screen bad guy Sean Bean as Dr. Merrick. Steve Buscemi also has a small role as the guy who helps the clones escape. Djimon Hounsou plays the bounty hunter of sorts who is set on the job of bringing the clones back to the fortress or destroy them before anyone learns of their existence and he becomes quite the anti hero but he performs a great role. Everyone plays their role in the storyline which really covers a lot of ground and always explains everything. It's an intriguing sci-fi film with a rather scary look at the future. And if you think you've seen car chases...NOTHING compares to the intense highway battles that are done in The Island. They are brilliantly choreographed and filmed (highly recommend watching the special features on the DVD) and are just brazenly terrific.<br/><br/>The film incorporates some of my favorite aspects of a sci-fi film. The naivety of these underground clones getting used to the ""real world."" (something along the lines of Demolition Man), a very realistic look at what the world could become and an intriguing epic storyline. As with any action movie it also heavily requires you to leave reality at the door. There are the typical heavily laden action film plot holes, and things that are truly just unbelievable or too vast for reality but that's what makes action fun!! So if you can leave that sense of....oh yeah right, come on....and just enjoy the film then you will find The Island to be a great sci-fi action flick and I can't believe it didn't do much better and I don't understand the negative feedback I heard it getting. I do however don't quite understand the title. This film has such little to do with ""The Island"" that it throws people off. There is never really even an Island in it. So call this movie...Clone Wars...oh wait McGregor already did that...well you won't be disappointed in this one if you like all those things that it is!! 9/10"

","When 4 people at the rental store recommended this movie, I thought, they have to be kidding, but I watched it and WOW, there are a few scenes that don't seem to work, but even the worst of the ""oh yeah, like that is going to happen"" scenes has some plausibility in the script (The key lies in what they eventually say is going on in Lincoln's brain) the first half of the story is the better thinking person's movie and as Roger Ebert has said, the second part is an action movie. I don't particularly like action movies but this one was pretty good as it goes.<br/><br/>All in all the credit for this goes not to the stars but to the director and to the glue that makes it work, Steve Buscemi who is just brilliant in every scene."

","Well, I thought The Island was a good idea that progressively soured over the duration of the film. The end of the movie is abrupt, unsatisfying, and generally the type I hate. I almost stopped the movie before it actually ended, because I knew that the narrative was already over. Imagine five minutes of conclusion that you could foresee just as easily as background video during the credits.<br/><br/>Some aspects of this film were so strangely inconsistent with what futurists predicted for other elements. Giant holographic screens, biometric scanners everywhere, medical sensors that use nanotechnology, fifteen layers of public transport throughout the city skyline, and ""black wasp"" hover jet bikes with heads up weapon targeting displays. But wait.<br/><br/>The old school 23-inch Apple Cinema displays are still popular 45 years later. And so are the Dodge Magnum station wagons with sporty Hemi engines. And the Chevrolet SSR Heffalump? Fit for the intersection of IT nerd and white trash who Steve Buscemi plays.<br/><br/>Instead of hiring a team of futurists to do the job well, as Steven Spielberg did, Michael Bay decided he could pick out some likely scenarios, of what the world will be like after his death. Like the Johnny Rockets empire that will succeed Michael Bay's film legacy. Johnny Rockets is ever present in the Los Angeles of the future. Much more so that the Taco Bell of Demolition Man's future. We all know that Johnny Rockets has what it takes to survive the brutal restaurant industry of the future. But what about bacon? Could Bay have selected a more unlikely delicacy for the future? And hepatitis? Humans can be cloned and brainwashed into full adulthood within a year (and no stretch marks!) but there is still no cure for Hepatitis B in sight?"
"johnmbale","7","3","5","21 August 2005"," Fast chase in Alien Country
","Derivative of 1984, Brazil, and The Matrix, this sci-fi feature is better than average. It is really a long chase movie, albeit in strange territory, and chases have been the stuff that made Cinema great. Effective sets, and special effects help move the show along at a good pace. Big Brother in this case, watches over a secret factory that produces human clones, an insurance for body parts for the wealthy members of the human race, who can afford to have a clone made to order. When two of the clones think they are human and manage to escape, all Hell breaks loose, literally. Of course the chase sequences stretch one's credibility to the limit, but its all good fun, and most fans won't object. Competent performances by the leads, Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, and the excellent Steve Buscemi, combined with snappy direction make the film worth a look."

","It's a load of rubbish really but is a bit of fun. Pure, silly entertainment value. Steve Buscemi is genuinely funny in it - cracks all the jokes and looks like he's taking the whole role tongue in cheek whereas some of the others are almost embarrassingly serious. For dumb clones, these people learn fast! Way over the top destruction and car chases. I like the way under all that space age scenery where the clones live are lots of wheezing pipes and rust! And the outside world is as grubby as ever though the desert looks superb. Mind you there's a good story and film in the underlying idea - cloning people and using those clones for ""spare parts"" as your original parts deteriorate. It could be taken to some nasty conclusions....but that's for someone else to make. As I said, this film is 100% fun."

","It was perfectly good eye candy. It truly was. If one was willing to put one's brain on hold and ignore the plot holes big enough to hold a motor vehicle chase in (Which, oddly enough, was what Bay used every half-hour or so to distract us from the plot holes), one could have fun watching this film. Because, it was fun. Largely forgettable fun, but fun nonetheless. The action set-pieces were pretty well-crafted. The technology, although out of reach today, seemed internally consistent.The mirror ""The Island"" holds up to the self-obsession so prevalent in our culture, as well as that culture's weakness for the hope of that ""one-in-a-million chance"" that could change our lives forever, is both clear and uncompromising. Of course, my opinion could be biased by the fact that the sight of Scarlett Johansson makes my brain skip its track for a moment..."

","For me this was like watching two different movies. I actually found the first part, the ""Logan's Run"" section as I like to think of it, rather uninteresting and the movie didn't really take off until the chase section (the middle). Somewhat paradoxically, I feel that the cloning stuff (which I didn't like) might have been made more interesting if it wasn't used simply as a springboard for the chase scenes (which I did like).<br/><br/>I thought that flying motorcycle was really cool; I caught myself smiling when I saw that.<br/><br/>I didn't understand why that technician at the installation just hands Ewan the keys to gain access to the boiler room area.

"durrettd","8","3","5","24 July 2005"," Unexpected Surprise
","This is a surprisingly good movie. I could best describe it as Logan's Run meets Soylent Green. Initially, you might expect this to be your typical science-fiction film with some neat effects but uninspiring plot with bland acting and dialogue. Well, not with this film. Both the leads play their characters incredibly well forcing you to sympathize with them. The depiction of a potential future is really incredible. However, the most memorable part of the film besides the beautiful Scarlett Johansson are the wonderful special effects sequences that really bring the audience into the film. I'd go so far to say that they are better than The Matrix sequences.<br/><br/>Now, it's not all fun and games. Some situations are painfully unrealistic giving the feeling of a dues ex machina in some instances. Additionally, the movie drags in some points and feels surprisingly long for only 2 hours. This is mainly because the beginning details life in this futuristic world so thoroughly.<br/><br/>All in all, surprisingly good acting, nice dialogue, excellent effects, and very, very entertaining."

","This brilliant movie that is definitely worth your time. It's thrilling throughout while displaying a cyberpunk future in which advanced technology is driven by money and humans' most basic instincts. If you know of ""Brave New Wold"" (the popular dystopian roman by Aldous Huxley) this movie is for you. Michael Bay delivers stunning special effects and Cinematography. The movie is issuing human nature from various aspects such as psychology (in terms of control), behaviour, genocide, and overall: evolution.<br/><br/>The story of striving to become god gets told in an exciting new way that warns us of certain real dangers we face in the future and that even non-scifi fans are going to love."
"tonori","2","4","8","16 April 2006"," Shame on you, Michael Bay
","This movie gives me an impression of Michael Bay on some absurd pro-life crusade. I'm not aware of Mr. Bay's political stands, but the notion of memories as a genetic element to me seems like a - more or less conscious - criticism towards genetic research and technology. It seems slightly absurd from a scientific view, but also the over-all theme of the sanctity of life and the apparent meaninglessness in the lack of (or lack of gratitude towards) God adds stone to the burden. There is even a scene to underline the ""thou shalt not play God"" theme, where the mercenary, with his ethic and moral authority and conviction, nails the bad guy to the cross, no pun intended.<br/><br/>But that aside, there is more that signifies this movie being best left at the shelf at your local video store. There is little new to see here. The totalitarian total-controlled society of this utopian society has been depicted with greater success earlier. The futuristic elements of the movie aren't all that exciting. Visually, the idea of uniformity, in every way, is depicted with what seems to be slightly uninspired half-hearted imagination. Product placement is painstakingly obvious, they have Puma sneakers and xbox video games (Michael Bay and Bill Gates, that's for sure an unholy alliance worthy of a trilogy). The colours are fluorescent. The visual aspect is taken to far greater heights in, say, Equilibrium or Gattaca, as is the foundation of society. Unlike in ""Brave New World"", where sexual promiscuity is a civic duty, in the world of the products of ""The Island"", it is supposedly suppressed as the products are grown. There are ""rules of proximity"", among other things which leave the script with increasingly gaping holes. All in all, there aren't a lot of things in this film that you couldn't have seen before.<br/><br/>Among other things perhaps worth mentioning are the not-so-exiting attempts at depicting a society 20 years from now. There are hover trains out of Back to the Future and video phones, made by Nokia, as well as information directories presented to you by MSN Search. Of course, since this is a Michael Bay film, it needs a spectacular chase scene. In this movie there are quite a few chase scenes, and not all of them are all bad. You're still left with the feeling that the main characters escape simply because they are the main characters. When it comes to dealing with elementary physics, the movie fails again, but pleasantly there is a rather conservative number of exploding cars.<br/><br/>You would think the ever enchanting Scarlett Johansson would save this flick from being a total and utter failure, and that actually isn't far from the truth. Where McGregors character collapses as a result of his resolve and seemingly God-given ability to deal with any situation in manners that even James Bond would take pride in, Johansson depicts her character with the proper and balanced naivety. The movie doesn't float on her outofthisworldly appearance, although her blonde hair and clear eyes are at almost any time present in frame. But then, sadly, there is a sex scene. It seems misplaced and close to absurd. My first thought was that the producers said ""Ok, Michael, you do know that we have Scarlett Johansson casted, there NEEDS to be a sex scene!"". And then Michael replied ""that's OK, I'll present it in a way that states that sex is a gift from God"". There is very little that builds up tension between the characters to be released in this manner. There aren't a lot of deep glances stolen at the back of a scene, no, Mr. Bay, the innuendo-hating storyteller short on time (even as the movie clocks in at 130 minutes) gives us images of them holding each others hands and such. There's no time for magic, not even for the infatuation of mentally-aged 15-year-olds - but when they finally do get together, they do so without as much as a hint of awkwardness.<br/><br/>The movie is (too?) fast-paced to build up any proper momentum. There are directions in the story that could have been given a greater deal of attention, or have been cut altogether. The prime example being when Johanssons character asks herself if her survival means that the mother of the child she just spoke to over the msn/nokia video phone thingy (a child that refers to her as his mother) will die, but this is not at all elaborated. Another example is Buscemi's character simply being killed off and that's the end of that. The movie definitely has its moments, but too often loses itself in futuristic un-funniness and snappy lines. There's plenty of fighting and/or fleeing to go twice around, and as noted, there's Scarlett Johansson. What's most notable to me, though, is the feeling that this movie could have presented an amusing twist to a well-used near-future story formula of totalitarity and unprecedented cruelty. Sadly, it doesn't."

"bob the moo","Null","4","8","21 November 2005"," No brain or logic to any of it and the noisy action isn't enough to cover the problems
","Lincoln Six Echo is one of many people who survived the contamination of the outside world and now live in an enclosed complex where everything from their diet down to their daily clothing to managed for them. They live and peaceful but controlled life with their only ambition being to win the regular lottery and be taken away to the Island  the last place on earth that is outside and free of contamination. However Lincoln begins to question the logic of the whole thing when he finds a bug that has ""survived"". His suspicions lead to discoveries about the truth behind the complex and his very existence and sees him and Jordan Two Delta fleeing the complex with a small army on their trail.<br/><br/>The issue of cloning and such is a timely focus for The Island given the debate over stem cell research etc at the moment, so this film would have benefited from producing food for thought as a side-order to lots of action. However when you have Michael Bay as your director it is unlikely that he is going to be able to pull that off and indeed this film pretty much fails to do anything with the cloning issue of any value other than using it to remake Logan's Run and make lots of stuff go bang and fall down. This means that the majority of the film is just used to set up the next chase scene and we are not allowed to think (or indeed given any encouragement to do so) while the script ignores any moral complexity in the issue and just makes this about two people running away from a well-funded conspiracy  the reasons don't really matter after a while. This is a real shame because it could have been so much more interesting and so much more challenging but instead it just treads the genre line and soon the narrative has lost all impact and you find yourself wishing the next thing would just hurry up and explode. Bay may not have written the film but he is just as much to blame for this as the writers; you do get the feeling that he thinks everything by be solving by having a helicopter shot sweep around his characters on a mountain top.<br/><br/>Which is not a bad thing in itself because the film does produce one or two enjoyable action sequences but you do have to ask yourself if it is worth 130 minutes for ""one or two"" impressive special effects? I would say no because, although they do look impressive, they do lack genuine tension, mainly because we have no real concern or interest in the characters or their story. So yeah, things fall down in very expensive ways and if that is all you want then welcome aboard but personally I just got tired of the hollow noise I was watching. The cast don't do anything to help either, nor could they be expected to without any material to work with. McGregor appears to have forgotten how to act after three Star Wars movies spent in front of a blue screen  he is boring here and about as far from being an action star as he is from being the impressive young Scottish actor he was when I first saw him. Johansson is sexy and currently hot property but this will not allow her to produce many more films like this where she just sleep walks her way through a performance that could have been delivered by any blonde starlet. Bean is a good baddie but I'm sure he could have done more had the material been there to use his character as a source of moral complexity, but we'll never know. Likewise Hounsou is OK but the material is just not there to make him interesting or a threat. Buscemi is always a welcome addition but you do have to wonder why Duncan bothered.<br/><br/>Overall a noisy hollow action movie whose one or two thrills might be enough to satisfy some genre fans but not the majority. The script could have been an enjoyable mix of action thrills and moral complexity but it feels like it was generated by a computer and it fails to engage on any level  even failing to inject tension and pace into the action or the narrative. Could have been more but is really just a ho-hum action movie that has nothing really to recommend it for or make it stand out in a sea of much better action blockbusters."
"logarhythms","4","4","8","28 July 2005"," The Island - Not Bay's best
","Where do I start? I'm surprised that people can call this Michael Bay's best film. I've read several reviews the last few days and I'm amazing how many people are giving this movie an A. It just seems that he's continually headed backwards. Bad Boys is his best film to date. It's not too flashy, or too corny, or too unbelievable. It's just on the limit of what I consider a balanced, fun action movie. The Rock is slightly over the limit, and the rest, well, they just keep getting more out of control. I'll admit that The Island is fun in parts, but it's edited with a hacksaw. You can almost see where whole scenes are dropped. Not to mention all of the exposition that dropped with it. Derivative, yes. Does that particularly bother me? No. It's so hard not to be derivative these days, but there is some shameless lifting of scenes from the 6th Day (which I thought was a decent movie. Some of you will stop reading right here.) The setup for the Island is good, as well as the initial escape from their ""prison"". You can accept the lax security and ignore some rather obvious problems. Just take for instance the whole Djimon Hounsou character. I don't buy for a minute that CEO Merrick (Sean Bean) of a $120 billion dollar company is going to let him in on the big secret. He's just some expendable mercenary hired to kill a few people. His character is merely a tool to represent the ""audience"" and he's imparted with the entire story needed to make sure you know why we're blowing all this stuff up later. It would have been a better story for this mercenary, who loses all of his friends in the process of hunting down two clones (which happens in the movie and he's not even upset), to find out the truth on his own, side with the clones, and then come back to get his revenge on the CEO for treating him and his friends as expendable. Instead he sides with the clones by relating to them through a death mark he received from African genocide. Why is Hounsou always relegated to play the slave role, even in the future? It's cliché, insulting, and boring. It reminds me a quote from Bowfinger (another good, ignored movie) by Eddie Murphy's character where he's talking with his agent: <br/><br/>KIT: White boys always get the Oscar. It's a known fact. Did I ever get a nomination? No! You know why? Cause I hadn't played any of them slave roles, and get my ass whipped. That's how you get the nomination. A black dude who plays a slave that gets his ass whipped gets the nomination, a white guy who plays an idiot gets the Oscar. That's what I need, I need to play a retarded slave, then I'll get the Oscar. Go find me that script. Buck the wonder slave!"

"MovieManiacX","10","5","11","29 December 2005"," You've Got To Hand It To Michael Bay...
","The man knows how to make entertaining movies. Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, and now The Island. The Island is one of the most satisfying sci-fi action movies of the year.<br/><br/>The acting by everyone is excellent. Ewan McGregor is great as Lincoln, playing the role with curiosity and bravery. Scarlett Johansson, looking very hot, plays Jordan just fine, giving the character a sweet and tender touch. The two have great chemistry together and both discover the new 'outside world' in some very amusing ways. Sean Bean nails the role of Dr. Merrick superbly, downplaying it with a hint of madness. Djimon Hounsou and Steve Buscemi are great in their supporting roles, making the most of them. I also enjoyed the 'practically-a-cameo' appearance by Michael Clarke Duncan.<br/><br/>The ideas thrown out there by the movie are handled fairly well. The thought of whether or not cloning should be used for something like it is in the film is looked at almost like abortion. Though I think they could have delved deeper into all the ideas and problems, they didn't need to here. This is a Michael Bay movie! Let's blow some stuff up! <br/><br/>The action sequences and special effects are eye-poppingly spectacular. My favorite action sequence, probably of the entire year, was the amazing 'train wheel chase', which has our two heroes rolling gigantic metal train wheels off the back of a speeding truck, onto the freeway where enemy cars are tailing them. Even though it lasts less than two minutes, watching these vehicles flip over, roll end over end, and get torn to shreds was incredible! One other note-worthy scene is where a huge building logo falls off the building and crashes into a helicopter. Great stuff! The other special effects are generally well done, not relying on CGI too much.<br/><br/>Michael Bay knows how to polish things up damn good. The cinematography is excellent, with teal blues and golden ambers permeating the screen. Bay manages to give the film a sleek and shiny look, really giving the movie a futuristic feel to it. The chases are all shot with a kinetic intensity that fits the lightning pace of the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The music is also excellent, complimenting the movie perfectly. Steve Jablonsky did a great job. Keep up the good work Steve! <br/><br/>The Bottom Line: <br/><br/>An excellent sci-fi actioner from the Bay-man with some awesome chase scenes, great acting, and a little something for you to think about."
"taichi69","1","5","11","25 December 2005"," Rip off
","I have seen this movie and it is a blatant rip off of the book ""The Experiment"" by John Darnton. I called the company who made the movie and asked them why John wasn't credited for the script. They claim the movie isn't an adaptation of Darnton's book and that they bought an original script. Anyone who has read the book and seen the movie will immediately recognise that it is the same thing with some very minor changes. Whoever sold this script to Warner Brothers and to DreamWorks pictures has obviously read Darnton's book and should be ashamed of themselves. This is the worst rip off since Milli Vanilli. I think John should be paid for turning his book into a movie. I hope he sues them. I bet if Ewan McGregor had known he wouldn't have agreed to do the movie. It is a shame because the book was excellent and the movie would have been better if Darnton had had input into the process of making his book into a movie"

","You don't normally hear the words Micheal Bay and Box-Office Bomb in the same sentence, but it's true. This movie did not do very well at the box office, and it's a shame. The Island is Bay's best movie, at least from what I've seen (haven't seen the Rock), and definitely deserved to be a hit.<br/><br/>OK, first the bad stuff, there are plot holes, quite a few plot holes to be exact. Normally I don't mind plot holes in an action blockbuster, but this plot needed to be smoothed over. Also the intelligence of the character's always changes. They said they are as smart as 15 year olds, but at times they talk like 4 year olds, and even sometimes like 30 year olds. And there is way too much shaky cam during the fight scenes.<br/><br/>The main thing I like about this movie is...well...the plot. I know, it's almost like a rule that the plot has to suck in a Micheal Bay film. You can like the action and special effects, but the plot must suck. But it doesn't, I really like this idea, and it brings up some good questions. Would you kill someone if it meant that you could live longer. Some scenes get pretty hard to watch at times because you don't want to see the people killed. That doesn't mean the action and effects are bad. While the action is a too shaky, it's still entertaining. And I love the look of the future. It isn't too far fetched that a future would look like this. The cars don't hover, but they look different. They don't have super advanced technology that you would expect an alien to have. And the acting isn't half bad.<br/><br/>The Island is an entertaining blockbuster that actually has a very interesting plot. It brings up questions without easy answers, and has some good action, effects and humor to boot. I have heard it ripped off like three other movies, but I didn't see those movies, so for me this was very original."

It is complete with science, a lot of action, drama, and romance. During the whole movie i was mesmerized, dying to know what would happen next. The plot in this movie twists and takes unexpected turns. The special effects were amazing.It is a story that may well be possible in the future. It makes us question our ethics, how far will we go in the pursuit of science and will it be worth it. Is it morally right to create clones of ourselves. This movie was one of my favorites. It brought up emotions and feelings and you truly felt as if you were in the movie yourself."

","I don't know how many have seen Parts: The Clonus Horror, and I'll try to be vague, so that nothing is spoiled for anyone who has only watched one or the other. Hasn't this concept been treated in a short story? Anyway, obviously Bay makes a prettier and more epic movie, which is quite impressive, considering that it's ""hit you over the head with a stark red billboard""-obvious that he is working from a palette with only the colors of black and white(heck, *literally*, in some cases, here) in putting this together. He's so busy making it clear to the viewers who the bad guys are that he wastes just short of all potential to actually be making any important, interesting and memorable points and arguments in this charged debate. I'd say he thinks he does better than he really does, as far as making his case. But hey, mainstream audiences are a sensitive mass of people, easily spooked. And who knows, maybe people will wind up thinking about the issue based on this. Oh, look at that. Pigs flying. Anyway, yes, it's got excellent effects. It's never boring, and generally well-paced. There is genuine tension, and this is entertaining and riveting. The acting is great, and the action is cool. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. The comic relief can be cringe-inducing, as can at least a couple of the clichés. Overall, the writing isn't bad, and when they aren't sacrificing common sense for the sake of foreboding and/or stereotyping, this does a nice enough job. The explanations work out, for the most part. Characters are credible and reasonably developed. The dialog varies. There is a little sexuality, strong language and violence. This doesn't feel terribly toned down. The DVD has a fifteen minute long ""making of"" featurette, with interviews and behind the scenes footage, and it's worth a look. I recommend this to fans of Michael, and to a somewhat lesser extent, anyone else involved in making it. 7/10"

","I watched The Island last night for the second time. It was fun, it had great moments, and it had Scarlett Johansen. Excuse me if I sound tritely male, but she is about as sexy as any actress to have come down the film pike in many, many years. I could watch her breath and be satisfied. The premise of the film is intriguing, and the over-all acting is very, very good. Sean Bean, who seems to have fallen into type casting as a villain, lives up to his type casting. Ewen McGregor is not disappointing, but he fails to carry the film No, it is Scarlett that carries this film. What a future this young woman has. What I really liked about The Island is the connection I saw between it and Logan's Run. The idea that people could be confined within a ""bubble"" and contained is very alluring. What this film does that is different than Logan's Run is introduce the idea of mass cloning. Mass cloning brings with it an entire breath of thought of which mere futurism falls short. I highly recommend this film to those who enjoy science fiction, high theatrics, action, and beauty."
"Galina_movie_fan","6","2","3","2 April 2007"," The fast and furious attack of the clones
","""The Island"", the combination of Action / Sci-Fi/ Thriller and more is quite enjoyable (it is always fun to see not just one but two Ewan Mcgregors on the screen; Scarlett has become a real beauty, and Steve Buscemi makes any film watchable) but easily forgettable summer blockbuster. ""The Island"" takes place in the near future and tells the story of a world where the cloning have became a reality and the wealthy citizens can and do order the clones in order to successfully treat their present or future health problems. The clones are living human beings with the feelings and dreams that have no idea about their destination which is to become the source for matching body parts, blood, and organs of the ones who paid for them. The movie raises very interesting, serious, and important ethical questions but does not have time to stop and to contemplate on them - it is too busy with the non-stoppable fast and furious action sequences. It had the potentials of ""The Matrix"" (first one) or ""Minority Report"" - it just did not happen."
"magicpen44","9","2","3","27 June 2006"," Summary of the Island
","If I had to pick a single work to describe this movie it's bizarre! Bizarre because of the controversy plot, exciting action, and the weird, yet looming knowladge that this could really happen one day. And what about the actors? Wow they are amazing! Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson were at their best with acting and the feeling that they put into this movie. If you have a light stomach, I highly recommend that you do NOT view this fantastic, yet sickening movie. I give it a 9/10 for the lack of explanation in some parts. The Island had absolutely incredible computer generated graphics and was filmed in such a way that you really were pulled into the action and suspense. This is definitely a movie which you should watch during the bright bright day."
"BA_Harrison","7","2","3","26 March 2006"," Where are the clones? Send in the clones....
","It is ironic, perhaps, that a film dealing with the central theme of cloning feels somewhat like a clone itself. The first 30 minutes or so of The Island (and the ending) is more a less a direct crib from 70s classics 'Logan's Run'(in which the main protagonists must escape their enclosed environment to escape execution at the hands of those in control) and the lesser known 'The Clonus Horror'.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen play clones who discover the terrible truth behind their existence - that they exist only as spare parts for the rich - and decide to hot foot it to sanctuary - in this case, Los Angeles. They are pursued by a professional tracker and his gang and at this point the film becomes a hi-tech actioner of the kind to be expected from director Michael Bay, the man behind OTT mega-budget blockbusters Armageddon, Bad Boys and Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>Bay takes proceedings very seriously, obviously believing he is making a profound piece of work that questions the ethics of cloning; what the viewer actually gets is a big budget sci-fi epic that is preposterous, yet very entertaining.<br/><br/>The film looks great – cinematography and special effects are well above par – and Bay's usual annoying habit of over-editing sequences is kept to a minimum. The action is loud, fast and spectacular, although some scenes are so far fetched that they will have you sniggering in disbelief. McGregor and Johannsen are pretty good as far as eye-candy leads go, and they deliver some ridiculous lines with admirably straight faces.<br/><br/>And when the film had finished, I actually found myself in two minds about the ethics of cloning. Part of me felt that cloning was perhaps wrong – that playing God is a dangerous thing to do. The other part of me wants to know where I can get me a Scarlett Johannsen clone for a little experimentation of my own!"
"Teebs2","6","2","3","25 January 2006"," The latest in crash bang!
","The Island, the latest from crash bang maestro Michael Bay, is proof that the Hollywood blockbuster strategy, something for everyone designed to appeal to a mass global audience, can backfire. In this case the broad appeal strategy results in a strangely timid and diluted film, which just isn't quite strong enough in any area to appeal enthusiastically to anyone - a point made clear by it's surprisingly low box office performance: a domestic gross of $36m compared to it's $122m budget.<br/><br/>Although the film offers some interesting ideas with regards to cloning, corporate business and free will presented with at least a hint of intelligence, none of the moral implications or ethical arguments are explored to the degree of depth needed to involve the viewer on an intellectual level. None of the ideas are hugely original, being familiar from a multitude of sci-fi films over the years. Even visually, the film still can't beat the dystopia's of the sci-fi films of the 70s such as THX 1138 or Logan's Run. Ideas pass by, raise just about enough interest and meaning needed for the plot and are then forgotten in favour of Mr Bay's usual fetishistic worship of explosions, shiny inanimate objects and all things crash-bang-whizz.<br/><br/>However, even here we've seen it all before in recent years, so even aficionados of no-brainer action aren't likely to be satisfied. A freeway chase also featured in Bay's own Bad Boys II and was far more exhilarating in the otherwise dire Matrix Reloaded. Shoot-outs, fight scenes, heck even sex, is all diluted down to a flat, inoffensive censor friendly aesthetic by slick, evasive editing.<br/><br/>Performance wise, at first it seems refreshing to have such lesser stars as McGregor and Johansson take the leads until you realise they're not actually that great. McGregor's awful American accent seems to suck his usual strong character from him, and his ""real-life"" double thankfully retains his natural Scottish accent. Johansson is a surprising casting choice, obviously designed to target the Elisha Cuthbert-alike worshipping teen market, as much as the ""Lost in Translation"" crowd. The script really gives her little to do, but she's feisty enough and gorgeous, of course, although that airbrush effect on her skin is hideously fake, though I guess that fits with the plot. Unfortunately it is partly the script lets them down, but McGregor just doesn't quite have the charisma of Will Smith, Bruce Willis or even Tom Cruise in this kind of leading role. Buscemi pops up for his obligatory sleazy but helpful role, and gosh that tech job must pay well for him to afford THAT wife and her mail order outfits! Sean Bean yet again pulls out his stock baddie template as does Djimonn Hounsou.<br/><br/>So just that little short of satisfying on both ideas and action front, a largely humourless script and unconventional casting. The film lumbers along powered by Steve Jablonsky's relentless, bombastic score, glossy visuals and nauseatingly quick editing.<br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>Something about the film just about keeps it on the right side of entertaining. Love or loathe Michael Bay, he has a flair for this kind of thing. Unlike some consistently awful directors, his only major flop ""Pearl Harbor"" was down to a major misjudgement in subject matter and an awful script. Given a half-decent narrative, and good cast his crash-bang aesthetic can power a film along. While The Island doesn't quite power along on all cylinders, give me this over ""Pearl Harbour"" or the combined works of Steven Sommers, Paul W S Anderson or McG."

Well, the action part did not disappoint. It was pretty intense and mostly realistic. Still, the catching point was the plot. The story is very scary in the sense that it really can happen in the near future. It truly made me wonder about where future of humanity is headed. Very dark and disturbing. Not a perfect movie, and it shows that they compromised some scenes to get a PG-13 rating. That was a little disappointing, but I guess you can't blame them for wanting to make more money.

","All the ideas of this film are taken from other places.<br/><br/>The whole one story which we think is right and actually turns out to be the total opposite is taken from The Running Man. The whole being chased, once again The Running Man & Blade Runner, also Logan's Run.<br/><br/>Establishing that there has been some sort of pollution and people can't go outside apart from one place on Earth known as The Island is the first 20 minutes or so of the film. We learn about their lifestyle and characters, learn a little about The Island. You get there by winning the lottery. Everyone dressing the same and looking the same and not knowing anything about sex? Directly lifted from George Lucas' THX 1138.<br/><br/>The main character has weird dreams of drowning, being chased and killed or hurt. You totally know most of these things are going to happen or come close to happening which they do.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregors character is lost in a sea of people who want to all live the same life and strive for the same dream. He wants to explore, learn new things and ask the difficult questions that he can't seem to get answers to. Very Blade Runner.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansonn is pretty and nice to look at but her acting is utter garbage. I had no fun trying to watch her, she gave no assistance to the story at all. Her part could have been played by anybody.<br/><br/>Steve Buscimi plays himself pretty much, but I felt his character could have been used far better. Killing him was pointless, especially after he'd just told the clones not to trust anyone. The whole point there could have set him up to finally be the person to betray them.<br/><br/>Sean Bean's character really seemed to me NOT to be the kind of person to get his hands dirty, so his fight scene near the end seemed pointless and tacked on. The last 20 minutes of the film were pretty pointless, these clones seemed intelligent. They escaped, they were free. Why they thought their sponsors would help them puzzled me.<br/><br/>Why they went back also seemed very tacked on at the last minute, the script writer thought perhaps he didn't have enough material. The ""sex"" scene was totally pointless, it was not needed.<br/><br/>On the whole the ideas behind this film were good, visuals were excellent and the plot ran fairly well except for a few strange ideas. The whole missing a shoe thing could have been resolved. Most people will enjoy this film, I personally felt it could have been a whole lot better and was left wanting more."

It relies heavily on special effects (which are spectacular if not believable) and a story line stolen from Logans run, but the acting talents of Mr McGregor and Ms Johansen pull it together. If it wasn't for these two actors, i think the whole thing would have fallen apart very quickly. Support from Sean bean is good as always. I only hope that if Logan's Run ever gets a re-make, The audience will return to the cinema and not compare it the same way fantastic Four has been compared to The Incredibles (note to marvel:-Disney should be sued big time for a total rip off)"
"superscal23","5","2","3","19 August 2005"," Could have been a lot worse, but also could have been a lot better.
","The Island is not a bad movie; it's just another in a long line of frustrating Hollywood thrillers that have a good movie living inside of them desperately trying to get out. There's so much that's good here, that the bad brings down the entire experience. The underlying problem with this movie is Michael Bay. He has missed the mark yet again. The Island starts out as an engaging, entertaining Sci-Fi film. Then, about halfway through, it gets Bayified. Guns, explosions, chases, and actors yelling ""run"" over and over again.<br/><br/>The movie starts out in a futuristic world where everybody dresses alike, lives in a contained environment, and believe that their only salvation is the prospect of getting to 'The Island', the only place in the world where life still flourishes. Well, as we all should know by now, ""life finds a way"". Lincoln, played by Ewan McGregor, starts to get curious about who he is and why he lives the way he does. Why can't he have bacon? Why is Tuesday always tofu night? Why does he always have to wear white, even after Labor Day (I wish that joke was actually in the movie). He has a ""friendship"" with Jordan, played by Scarlett Johannson.<br/><br/>This could have been a movie in itself as these characters begin to understand who they are, or what they are, and why they live the way they do. Instead, about 30 minutes into the film, Lincoln discovers the big secret, grabs Jordan, yells ""run!!"", and the Michael Bay film begins.<br/><br/>The big secret is that these people are clones. They have been created by a doctor, played by Sean Bean in an stunningly innovative casting choice, as a way to help their ""sponsors"" live longer. They are essentially used as replacement parts.<br/><br/>The next 90 minutes of the film include a freeway chase, a helicopter chase, a car chase, Lincoln yelling ""run"" at least 24 times, a car chase, a fall from a skyscraper, a car chase, numerous dead cops, and even a speeder bike chase. Eventually, the good guys win and the bad guys lose.<br/><br/>So, what's good in this movie? First, McGregor is good as both Tom Lincolns. You can tell them apart by the blond highlights in the clone's hair, by the way. I liked the fact that they realized that 2019 isn't that far away, so L.A. looks different, but not that different. There are familiar buildings, cars, brand names, etc. Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan and Djimon Honsou are all solid, not surprisingly. The movie has some funny moments, such as Lincoln getting worried when he's told his friend is ""in the can"". I know film-making technology has really come along way, but the scenes involving both Lincoln characters are so well done that you forget there's only one actor on the screen.<br/><br/>What's bad? First and foremost, Scarlett Johannson is completely wasted in this movie. It is by no means her fault. There is no character for her to play. The movie literally could have existed without the character of Jordan. She's only there to look good. We never find out what happens to the real Sarah Jordan. We're told she's likely to die even with replacement parts, so even though the movie is all about saving lives, I guess it wasn't in the script to save her. I liked Honsou as the tough, no nonsense operative out to retrieve the missing clones, but of course there ends up being more to his character. Otherwise, Honsou never would have been in this movie. And of course, there's the Bay factor. There are only so many times that characters can survive car wrecks, and falls from great heights, and bullets just missing them. It just gets old, and the box office reflects that."
"TheDude2004","5","2","3","19 August 2005"," And it started great...
","This film started as a non-Michael Bay film. It started slowly, the dialog had some sort of importance, and there were some very good new ideas. The atmosphere was almost frightening. These clones appeared non-human, with the exception of McGregor's character, who sounds like a small boy stuck on the ""why?"" and ""where?"" questions. An indeed very interesting beginning, with Lincoln Six-Echo's trip ""outside"" adding some suspense.<br/><br/>Suspense? in a Michael Bay film? that's new, original, and refreshing. And that suspense is actually effective...<br/><br/>But then, good old Bay wakes up, notices he has a lot of toys, and screws everything up. From the escape of Jordan and Lincoln (a really over-long chase)to the end, it becomes a classical action flick. Running, driving, flying, it's just a succession of uninteresting chases, action scenes that were added not by the script writer (who did a great job with the story, BTW), but by the production. Should I had that the scenes are useless? <br/><br/>In the chaos of fast-paced action, loud sounds, and 1 second frames, the actors do a fine job. The most interesting being Sean Bean's character, a guy who isn't entirely evil nor good...<br/><br/>As a story, the themes, issues and all are very relevant and actual. That's not the point here. The point is that out of a very interesting script, Michael Bay gave us a film we have already seen again and again. Michael, next time, do as you did with the beginning of this film, but do it on the whole movie. And doesn't it feels good sometimes to have a few more-than-2-seconds frames??"

The beginning of the movie makes you think you are in for a treat, as the plot of the movie begins to reveal itself, leaving you to fill out the blanks.And everything looks well made, from the surroundings to the equipment people use, as the story belongs to the future. The movie takes a wrong turn (i call it ""the Hollywood turn"") when it starts to act like an action movie, with really incredible stunts and a lot of computer-animated scenes.Don't get me wrong, it all looks very nice, but since i am a very realistic person it just seemed too incredible to me.<br/><br/>The idea of the movie is good, and you can really relate to it (well at least i can), the thing that bothered me most was, it could have been better...<br/><br/>The actors were solid, nothing special but also nothing wrong, the director has it own style, it is really hard to describe, but the actions scenes are not complete, meaning you might see two guys on the ground at one point and then in the next scene they are both standing up and fighting, and in the following scene they are doing something else, so it looks a bit different from what i am used to, but it doesn't make the movie look bad (or worse). <br/><br/>All in all, a solid entertaining movie, developing a very modern and soon-to-be-problematic topic."

","Regardless of the Producer's comments concerning Ms. Johanssen's and Mr. McGregor's connection with the audience, it is clear in the film that the actors are reflecting the stunted emotional depth of their characters. This aspect of the performances may get lost in the explosions and car chases, because it is one of the more nuanced and subtle aspects of the film. While I respect Mr. Bay's craft as a filmmaker, I'm not part of the demographic he is targeting usually. So, I just can't ""get into"" Mr. Bay's films, even though they look great. I'm missing something from practically every one of them. Except this one. The Island has that thing I'm looking for, but midway through, the film just morphs into a tired (yes, it's tired...) action-movie string of set-piece ""stunt-gredients"". The basis for the film, the reason The Island exists... that has weight and gravity and a sense of urgency, but it is exhausted(!) in the first ""Act"". It's clear that Mr. Bay is really only interested in having 17 to 22 year-old's buy tickets for his films, because he seems to be ignoring the intellectual and emotional demands of audiences over 30 yrs old. I don't want that to sound like a criticism, designed to nullify Mr. Bay's effectiveness as a filmmaker. What I hope is that Mr. Bay listens to this comment as an invitation from a great, vast audience of people hungry for some compelling cinema. Are you up to the challenge, Mr. Bay? We anxiously await your answer, with millions of dollars of ticket money that we will not part with until we're given better reasons to go to the cinemas on the opening weekend."

So I was kind of hesitant to go and see this movie simply because of Bays involvement. But what the heck I usually give directors a second....or third chance just in case they've learned a thing or two from their past mistakes. And I must say that Bay has learned a few things since his Armageddon days.<br/><br/>First off we get an interesting premise, that keeps you asking questions. You feel kind of lost, but in a good way because everything is sort of like a mystery. You know nothing of this environment in which the characters are at, so that keeps you reeled in. You don't know everything but you want to find out and that kept me going for a while. About half way thorough you will have figured out what the film is about and then well thats when the real fun starts. Some of the science fiction concepts and ideas presented on this film were really interesting. The whole cloning thing and its possible out comes are interesting as hell! I do think that they could have gone slightly deeper into the whole theme of cloning but this is an action film and its Michael Bay behind the camera so we get enough info just to get things going.<br/><br/>From a character development point of view, Id say this movie did very well. Well anyway, good enough for a Michael Bay summer blockbuster. We get to know these characters and their environments well before the action gets going.<br/><br/>Once the action gets going its a non stop chase through a futuristic city landscape. The action set pieces are simply amazing. Ill give Bay that. The guy can orchestrate cool as hell action sequences. There's a sequence on a bridge that involves a truck and some flying motorcycles thats simply amazing and fun to watch. The special effects were top notch all through out.<br/><br/>The art direction, the sets and the wardrobe give the film a distinct futuristic look. Lots of greys, lots of whites. I kind of got flashbacks to Lucas's THX-1138 and Stanley Kubricks A Clockwork Orange in look.<br/><br/>The story walks on familiar ground, that whole idea about everything being a lie and big brother is watching you and all that. There's hints of Welles 1984 and Huxlesy A Brave New World all through out this movie. You know question everything, go against the system and all that. Familiar ground for those familiar with those literary masterpieces. But the movie is done with such energy and spark that it pulls you in.<br/><br/>Of course there's one or two major whoppers on this film that I just couldn't digest in a credible way. I know its a science fiction film and all, but there's certain things that you just cant buy. For example there's a sequence where the characters are hanging from a buildings exterior logo and they fall from something like 100 stories or something...and we are supposed to believe that they were going to survive through that. Anyway I know its just a movie, but come on. That one had me rolling my eyes.<br/><br/>But then again, how can this film go wrong when it has Scarlett Johansen in tights for 90% of the film? Shes a bombshell and if you had any doubts they will be clarified here.<br/><br/>All in all a very well made action/sci fi flick that has its strengths in its visual flare. This one actually made me forgive Bay for his previous crap fests. Heres hoping the guy will keep it up for his next flick the movie adaptation of the popular 80s cartoon show: The Transformers.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 out of 5"

","The Island is the latest in a long line of sci-fi films like I, Robot, that have a good core idea and do not fully explore it. This film is full of good ideas but I get the nagging feeling that like many studio films the script got severely dumbed down to accommodate...Michael Bay? The Summer season? Why? Why not let a story stand on its own? This film is like a Jeckyll and Hyde patchwork of good ideas and tacked on stupidity. I can honestly say that the scenes inside the clone sanctuary were engaging, interesting, and far more see-worthy than all those chase scenes that completely took me out of the movie. If you are going to have action...why not make it a part of the real story? And better yet what is the point of action if there are so many quick cuts and the camera shakes so much I cannot even see what is going on...only get the impression that SOMETHING happened. Basically this was a letdown, there are good points such as the early scenes in the sanctuary involving the other clones and most of the revelation scenes were handled nicely, but I honestly believe that this film DID NOT need action, it didn't even need that ""let's go rescue the clones"" third act. This is a film that needed to be a character piece...but no, we need things blowing up. I kept wishing that this film would tread into bolder territory...let's say that there was no action climax or speeder-bike chase, or any of that nonsense, what if the picture ended with Lincoln and Jordan leaving together for a life of their own and forgetting about everyone else, and on the open sea Lincoln realizes the gravity of what he has allowed to happen as cuts of the defective clones being killed go on between his sad close-up...I had a similar problem with the 6th day, but at least that movie was consistent in tone. The island is yet another movie with all the potential in the world but has the complete inability to take it's story into uncharted territory. The score sounded like regurgitated Hans Zimmer (bad enough he rips himself off so much these days...Batman Begins's main theme sounded a lot like MI2 didn't it?) The one liner at the end where Sean Bean says ""I brought you into this world...(insert me thinking ""Don't say it"")...and I can take you out!"" (insert me thinking ""He said it"") My advice to the film makers (unless you'd prefer to hire me) is to take more chances with your stories and not have them devolve into action clichés with a couple good ideas sprinkled over hoping they give you credibility when in fact all you have is a film that could have been a lot better that no one will remember a month from now."

","WOW!! I saw this movie at a sneak preview screening. This movie is very intense with realistic, jaw-dropping action and chase scenes, and surprise after surprise! The acting is excellent and the storyline is taught, with a very satisfying ending! The less you know about the storyline before seeing the movie the first time, the better, because you get to discover what's happening at the same time that the main character (Ewan McGregor) does. Similar to The Matrix as an ""alternate reality"" film, and possibly better! This movie should create an EARTHQUAKE at the box office when it comes out.

","A movie which has one of the most interesting and on the same level disturbing plot in Science-Fiction. Cloning is an interesting topic and how they created here a world of adult children living the innocent live before killed behind closed doors for their organs is just an amazing idea and terrifying also. I know this movie seems to be a rip-off but it's way better designed. Unfortunately the interesting parts are after 45 min over and we get to see a lot of action, which at some point is just over the top Michael Bay stuff. I think it's ok to do it like this, because you feel better for our two heros, but they could have given the story a bit more. They put so much money in the product design of all the levels inside this bungalow in the desert and then they give it not a lot screen time. The ending suggests that it's very positive that they live now a free life, but in fact they will not be happy in that world because they have no family, no education, no home. In fact only the two hero's can live the live of their real counterparts because their counterparts have died. All the others will have a life which is not easy, but it's a life!"

"tabuno","7","1","1","23 January 2019"," A Solid Science Fiction, Action, Thriller
","22 January 2006. Warning: Spoilers. Michael Bay has made an action thriller based on a science fiction theme that is qualitatively impression. His ability to combine action and substantive drama with science fiction is improving the genre. The atmospherics, the set design, the collision between the supposed future and the present culture is fascinating. The director has incorporated more substance but not to the distraction of the action/thrills. The special effects are superior to ""War of the Worlds,"" the highly touted science fiction special effects movie of the year (though admittedly the subject matter and sequences are different) and more effective in their realism and impact. The performances are sound and the later events are dramatically viewed. The humor of Steve Buscemi was classic and added a very nice layered density to the movie.<br/><br/>Still there is room for improvement particularly with the storyline and character development, especially with Scarlett Johansson's role.<br/><br/>Scarlett plays two roles as does Ewan McGregor and Scarlett's counterpart or authentic, original identity is not given any screen time as compared to Ewan's and we are left hanging as to what becomes of her and her son. Considering the time constraints and everything, this omission is understandable, but still the opportunity for a more intimate dramatic sequence was possible and left out.<br/><br/>The ending is reasonable but not completely satisfying in its ultimate, convenient explosive climax, though it was thrilling and overall the whole sequence was entertaining and exciting.<br/><br/>The mix of drama and science fiction as with ""Aeon Flux"" is becoming more established of this genre and the improvement in such movies is continuing to raise the bar. Both movies show great promise for future directions of science fiction films. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","The Island (2005): Dir: Michael Bay / Cast: Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, Djimon Hounsou, Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi: A big improvement for Michael Bay whose two previous films, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor are absolute garbage. This is a much more create Bay with a theme regarding isolation as clones played by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson realize that a promised island paradise is a hoax and that their organs are up for grabs. Not a bad setup but from there McGregor and Johansson must escape the isolated facility and flee. This is very much similar to the George Lucas classic THX 1138. Fine production highlighting a lot of white. Superb performances from McGregor and Johansson who realize what is going on and attempt an escape only to return again to finish the operation. Djimon Hounsou plays a bounty hunter hired to bring them in but he will have a change of heart once he realizes what is happening to the clones. Sean Bean plays the facility head who suspects McGregor once questions are asked. He is the villain who issues the pursuit on the two escapees, but will eventually suffer defeat. Steve Buscemi has a small yet effective role as a maintenance worker who assists McGregor. This is the best film Bay has made, which is a surprise. Strong message regarding life and our greed for immortality when altogether isolating ourselves from hard facts. Score: 10 / 10"

","""The Island"" is part sci-fi thriller and part chase action flick. I found this combination to be a little rough on the edge but overall enjoyable.<br/><br/>Giving a synopsis of the plot is tricky because there are quite a few ""shocking"" developments throughout so I'll be brief. Basically the Earth has been decimated and only a few people are left alive. All of humanity lives within an isolated compound and you stay there until you are selected randomly to live in the last paradise on Earth, ""The Island"". Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) discover that something is not quite as it seems and attempt to escape.<br/><br/>It might not be the first time you've seen this scenario play out, but I don't necessarily count that as a flaw if the film brings in some original material. How many romantic comedies, or horror movies, when you really think about it have a plot that revolutionary? I feel like the premises is legitimately interesting and thankfully the revelation about the titular island is pretty quick so you won't be waiting for the characters to catch up to the audience for too long. At first you get some decent thriller elements with our protagonist trying to figure out what's going on and finding a way to escape while showing off some of the darker elements of this world. Then we get some big action set pieces that are a lot of fun and use some pretty impressive special effects. A criticism that I have for ""The Island"" is that the action climax is towards the middle of the film, not the end. Then another misstep; it breaks up the rhythm of the movie when during the conclusion it chooses to go back to the action stuff instead of going back to logical tone, which would be the paranoid, dystopian future thriller story. The movie concludes with a typical action mano-y-mano fight that is pretty ridiculous and not that exciting either.<br/><br/>Thankfully the movie doesn't have some of the incredibly bad comedic bits found in most of Michael Bay's other films and the naive protagonists have enough wits about them to stay mostly out the typical comedic ""Fish out of Water"" scenarios. It isn't a great movie but it's entertaining and there's more stuff that works than not. (On DVD, May 18th, 2012)."
"Wuchakk","7","1","1","22 March 2015"," Worthwhile sci-fi/action film with McGregor and Johansson
","Released in 2005, Michael Bay's ""The Island"" is a sci-fi/action flick starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as survivors in a post-apocalyptic society in 2019. Survivors of some sort of great ""contamination"" regularly pour into the huge facility where the people are strictly monitored by the staff and winners of a lottery are promised to go to a paradisal island. McGregor's character starts to suspect that all is not as it appears and tries to escape with his girlfriend (Johansson).<br/><br/>Bay has a bad reputation for making snazzy blockbuster dreck, like the ""Transformers"" series. While I'm not a fan of those movies—simply because they don't interest me -- I AM a fan of 2001's ""Pearl Harbor,"" which is ridiculously and undeservedly panned, and – less so – 1998's ""Armageddon."" So what about ""The Island""? It showcases state-of-the-art filmmaking with similarities to the great ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" albeit not as good. The first act is very intriguing as the viewer tries to figure out the nature of the enclosed society and the second act kicks into overdrive with some outstanding action sequences. Unfortunately, the third act isn't able to keep up the dynamic momentum despite a string of intense action sequences. Still, this is definitely a worthwhile sci-fi/action movie.<br/><br/>The film runs 136 minutes and was shot in Nevada, California and Detroit.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"
"LeonLouisRicci","9","1","1","11 February 2015"," Maybe Michael Bay's Best Movie
","Critics Favorite Whipping Boy, Director Michael Bay, has Made a Movie that Begs for Reconsideration. At Least for the Moment. The Always Overblown Style is Here Combined with a Good, if Derivative Story. The Timeless Trope of Dystopia, Deception, and Big Brother Sins that Have Become a Fertile Film Farm for Animals on the Hack.<br/><br/>Sure, Some of Bay's Sins are Here and to be Kind let's call them Auteur Flourishes. Blowing Stuff Up in a Really Cool Way, Hyper-Active and Fun Chase Scenes, Product Placement, and a Sophomoric Screenplay. <br/><br/>This is One of the Director's Best Movies. Maybe The Best. It is Completely Watchable and Virtually Cringe-Free.

He Places All that Beauty in Front of Some Horrific and Modern Concerns About Cloning, and Even Manages to Ask Some Good Questions.<br/><br/>Do these Manufactured Products, Insurance Policies for the Ultra-Rich, have Souls, for Example. Not New or Deep Questions but Relevant Questions Nonetheless. So this is Michael Bay at His Most Philosophical and Michael Bay at His Most Contemplative. That May be Like Seeing a Drive Through Shrink or a Mail Order Preacher but At Least its Better than No Counsel at All. <br/><br/>The Irony is that when the Director Finally Decides to Make a Movie that is Deeper than Usual and Thinks Just a Little Bit...Surprise...It's a Big Flop. So there You Go. His Mindless, Cringe-Fests Make Oodles of Money and the One Where He Borrows from Some Deep Thinkers and When He Tries the Least Little Bit to have Some Substance, No One Cares.<br/><br/>That's a Shame Really, Because this is a Highly Entertaining Movie and is Some Food for Thought for the ""Fun With Dick and Jane"" Crowd."

","I really liked this sci-fi action thriller about a society of clones who try to escape their faux Utopian world when they learn that they are actually harvestable beings, being kept as a source of replacement parts for the wealthy. I loved the intricate look we get into the intriguing, clone world, very cool.<br/><br/>There are definite elements of 'Logans Run' and 'BladeRunner' here, and some of the action scenes upon their escape are breathtaking thanks to Michael Bay. It does reach a point though where I found it to be action just for the sake of action. Ewan McGregor is a bonus (and pulls double duty here) although honestly there's not much chemistry between him and Scarlett Johansson, that's just a weird pairing.

"brchthethird","8","1","1","14 November 2014"," Michael Bay's last good movie
","Outside of THE ROCK, this is probably the best film that Michael Bay has done to date. Is it a great movie? Not especially, but it's about the best you can ask for when all of the typical Michael Bay elements are mixed together with a concept and story that, while borrowing heavily from previous sci-fi films, is still somewhat intelligent and thought-provoking. The story is about a man (Ewan McGregor) who lives inside a utopian facility when, one day, he figures out that he and the other inhabitants are just being used to harvest organs. He also escapes with a woman (Scarlett Johansson) who is about to be sent to ""The Island."" <br/><br/>The whole movie is basically set up to be a series of chase sequences, but it works because the concept is interesting enough and you care enough to want to find out what is going on, and why. For the most part, Michael Bay was on his best behavior here when it came to his sense of ""humor."" There were some stereotyped characters here and there, but nothing as pervasive as what would follow in his Transformers series. By now, his visual style was well-established, but it still wasn't so chaotic that you couldn't tell what was going on in any given frame. The performances were decent, and nobody stuck out as being really bad. I thought Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson did good work as the two leads, and Sean Bean made for a nice villain. Djimon Hounsou also did a good job as a bounty hunter on the trail of the two lead characters, and who also has a nice character arc. Returning back to the visuals, there was more CGI than in past Michael Bay films, but nothing too over-the-top or excessive. There was also a fair amount of practical effects work and plenty of well-done explosions (for those are into that sort of thing). Granted, these type of movies often push the bounds of suspension of disbelief when it comes to the relationship with physical reality, but it was still entertaining on a visceral level. The score by Steve Jablonsky and Hans Zimmer was also pretty good, and accentuated the visuals and action quite nicely. <br/><br/>However, one thing that became much more clear to me while watching this is that Michael Bay is basically an assembly-line director. There are certain elements which always be in movies that he makes. Some of them, like his chaotic camera-work and penchant for explosions are fine in moderation while others, like his voyeuristic obsession with the female form and juvenile sense of humor, would be better if left out entirely. Thankfully, there's not too much here in terms of the latter two. Also, like a lot of summer blockbusters, there's an obligatory romantic subplot. Yes, I lament that nearly all action movies have to shoehorn this element in, but I thought it was handled tastefully here, and not just there for the sake of being there. <br/><br/>Overall, this is most fun I've had watching a Michael Bay movie, outside of THE ROCK. In fact, I'd say that those two are tied for my favorite. The story is engaging, even if derivative, and the action keeps things moving along at a good clip such that I didn't feel the 135 minute run time as much. There's something here, even for people who don't quite take to Michael Bay's style, and it's a pretty good sci-fi/action movie to boot."

"motorfocus82","8","1","1","5 August 2014"," Bay's Best Movie
","I've come to the conclusion that the reason Michael Bay's movies are so brainless today - see the Transformers series and the new TMNT - is because of this film. It's actually thoughtful and coherent, not nearly AS MANY plot holes as we're used to out of him.<br/><br/>And it wasn't very successful. What's a poor director to do when he's expected to make films which cost over $100 million? You know the answer: dumb it down, kimosabe.<br/><br/>It's not a masterpiece. The concept is about 60% developed and the script is occasionally wonky. But it's not BAD in those areas, maybe a touch better than average for high concept in Hollywood. I'd say this is actually slightly more intelligent and involved than Arnie's 6th Day, which in itself wasn't a bad flick. Plus, since you're talking Michael Bay, he has some really good camera work sprinkled in there and a great highway chase scene. Djimon Hounsou is excellent as usual, the standout of the cast.<br/><br/>I don't know Bay's entire catalog, so I can't be absolutely sure. But this is his best film I'm aware of. If you like action with a science-fictiony feel, give it a shot."

The corporation also offers a Nazi-type ""final solution"" by pretending to send the clones to the ""Island"". This relocation center turns out to be an Auschwitz-like gas chamber. Now Hollywood can't be showing pro-abortionists as Nazis can they?

The action scenes, Brilliant, the scenery and photography/cinematography like most of his movies, absolutely stunning, the dialog,intense and realistic, the plot, actually made sense to some extent. If you just be open minded, you will enjoy this brilliant action packed adventure. The film opens up in this beautiful picturesque landscape in New Zealand in the crispy blue ocean and the sunlight focuses on Scarlett's face. That's what Michael Bay is good at, fast paced story telling, using bright lights to capture the expression on actor's faces, and intense slow motion camera, like bullet time mixed in with adrenaline pumping zooming camera chase scenes and the background heart pounding music to top it all off. Sure many people criticize him.<br/><br/>But the fact is he makes good action sequences that are fun to watch for a change from your regular movies. His movies are like a music video, there's always something you can pick out of them. The ending was magnificent also with the imagery but I will not spoil that for you. Basically clones find out they aren't real, and they aren't on an ""Island"" so they escape, find out who they really are, go out to find their real selves in the world, fall in love, get into action mayhem, and that's that.

By far one of the best Sci Fi action thriller suspense drama movies ever.<br/><br/>This movie is 2005 and I watched it on blu-ray on a 40inch 1080ptv with a Yamaha 5.1 system. It was my first time seeing this movie and I'm glad I saw it this way instead of on a SDTV with television 4watt sound and 10 minute long commercials. The experience was awesome, and I'm only seeing it now in 2010.<br/><br/>Every actor in this movie was excellent especially ""McGregor"". You really feel involved with the characters as the first part really focuses on the main characters, character development. I do not want to say too much because I could ruin it for people. Watch it, not knowing what kind of movie it is, because it's got everything.<br/><br/>The action scenes are mind blowing, just as good as Transformers movies, I guess I should expect that from Micheal Bay. The cinematography is beautiful, picture perfect panoramic scenes. Some of the scenes I would just want to pause capture and put it as a wallpaper on my computer have it made into a poster, you just know that some of the shots are done purposely a certain way to make you say wow! If you are going to watch this movie please watch it in high definition to fully appreciate it. I don't know if I would like this movie as much if I didn't see it this way. Oh, the only reason I gave it a 9 is because I thought a part of an action scene was ridiculously unbelievable for them to survive, but after all it's a movie right!? By the way, the only reason I am talking more about the action and cinematography is because I don't want to give away any pieces of the story because it is that good. Thanks for listening..."

","ITV2 showed this tonight. I'd never heard of it and from what I've read.. some thought it a flop. WHY? Damned good action movie.. OK, it borrowed from a countless number of films.. and seems one niggled accuser of copying got an out of court settlement. I'm amazed not more of that goes on.. BUT.. lets face it yet again.. WHAT film is totally original? Not now.. after all these years of cinema. I could have written this story.. and it Wasn't Pamela Anderson.. so thats Scarlett Johanson(sp).. gorgeous. Yes, shades of all sorts in this and I came into it before the escape chases started. HAD to be Michael Bay.. yes, lots of it over the top, too fast to see so almost a waste of stunts BUT.. damned good? Well worth watching and do I wait for the repeat or buy the DVD... Wide is preferable. If there's a making of... has anyone noticed lately many recent dvds haven't GOT a decent making of? Thats annoying. Still.. clones,I didn't hear the mention of a pollution scare, but thats current/topical. I like Ewan, was annoyed with his English accent in Star Wars.. didn't suit. It amuses me people find fault, and things that are missed in editing? Maybe thats because its against the clock. I think it had the lot.. a good all rounder. YES.. I must see it from the start next time."
"joecoolbrad","8","1","1","8 August 2009"," A popcorn flick, and a good one.
","Good: Powerful action, raises moral and philosophical questions usually not seen with Michael Bay, cool set.<br/><br/>Bad: All of the questions and themes have been done before and done better in Blade Runner and The Matrix. Why do there have to be soo many shameless product plugs.<br/><br/>Michael bay is famous for making sci-fi movies focused on action, and horror movies based on gore. In some ways this is good, it centers around the focal points of each genre, but this approach tends to be hit or miss.<br/><br/>The Island is a hit, and it surpasses the mindless action flick in the first half. Before watching this film, I could not foresee that Michael Bay would make (not-too-subtle) allusions to Brave New World, and The Republic. This elevated the film somewhat over the genre flick. However, I found myself finding the value of life aspect to be borrowing from Blade Runner, and the reality-versus-illusion aspect to be borrowed from The Matrix. The film even pays an obvious homage to the subway station scene in the Matrix in the climax ""MY NAME IS LINCOLN!"" But ultimately all this is a means to an end and that end is some very awesome sights and sounds. The setting goes above and beyond the call of duty here. I actually found myself willing to believe that this could really be the future. There was one problem, and that was the excessive product plugs, which became distracting. I though at first I could ignore them, but I soon found myself counting them. I ended with around 13 or 14.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: For people looking to have a good time, and may be satisfactorily thoughtful for those who hate all of Michael Bay's other films. Watch the film with a good sound system, and you'll be in for a ride."
"thefinisher_23","8","1","1","16 July 2009"," Better than it has any right to be
","I will not lie. I enjoyed pretty much all of this film because of its' gorgeous look, thrilling action, endearing characters and involving plot. That being said, its not Citizen Kane. It is just a very good film. The tale to me seemed sort of unique. The whole business of cloning being a means of self-preservation has be touched on just not in a mainstream movie.<br/><br/>The cast makes this film run. McGregor and Johannsson are both endearing and innocent as two clones out in a world far grander than they had been told. Hounson is one the best actors working and here he plays a thoughtful man good at what he does but not removed from his past or its' lessons. Sean Bean's character is one I could only imagine being played by him. He is cold, intelligent, and motivated perhaps by a moral few others see. His dialogue with Hounson leaves one to wonder if he has an inflated self-image or a legitimate cause(Hounson's answer is one of my favorite lines from 2005).<br/><br/>The action does get a bit ludicrous but as with Bay when doesn't it. Still the when stuff goes boom in his movies my jaw drops a little. This get a bit repetitive after awhile, especially when considered the movies first act seemed a tad devoid of Bay-ness. That's OK because while buildings explode and trucks are smashed we are following our two leads (who's token love story is tolerable). We care about them and their buddies back at the cloning mecca because (as the film illustrates soundly) they are REAL. The action is means to discover their fate and like so many good actions film we are only wowed because we have been made to care. Well done Michael Bay. You are now forgiven for Pearl Harbor."

","This is not a perfect or near perfect movie, nor does it have the besting acting in it.<br/><br/>However it has an intriguing story line and definitely one of the better movie plots that I've seen in a good while. The visuals are stellar and deserve five stars in themselves.<br/><br/>This has since it came out been one of my top ten favorite movies. However it deserves no more than 7-71/2 stars. Being that it lacks acting and strong writing, I can't give it many more points. <br/><br/>However it is definitely 110% worth your while to see this movie. I guarantee you'll have a blast."
"therussianbride","6","1","1","8 October 2007"," ""The Island"" is surrounded by shallow water
","The film started out very promising but ended like an average action flick. The actors were great, the pictures were breathtaking, the idea was excellent but nevertheless it ended like an average action flick. Don't misunderstand me, I like average action flicks. But I wouldn't rate them high. And granted, ""The Island"" is on the edge between being average and special, but unfortunately it jumps not further than 6 out of 10. Most of the happenings were predictable and though the topic it dealt with was interesting the movie waded most of the time through shallow water. Yes, I would watch it again but rather because of Scarlett Johansson's voice and Ewan McGregor's accent than because of the film itself. Which is nevertheless solid entertainment and worth of watching - once. I'm sorry, it could have been much better though."
"alcator","7","1","1","25 June 2007"," Don't look for 1984 and you won't be disappointed.
","I read a lot of negative criticism on this one and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. True, now that I search intensely for any hidden flaws, I might find some, but they are definitely not visible while watching the movie, and for a summer blockbuster, this movie works well.<br/><br/>Scarlet is really sweet and - as we learn later - true to her ""Delta"" origins; McGregor is like a teenager who's starting to question authorities but does not always know the right way to do it.<br/><br/>Other actors are showing their better skills as well, without over-acting.<br/><br/>The highway chase is one of the most spectacular that I've seen without being obviously ""designed"" that way - where other movies need way too improbable constellations of cars, trucks, helicopters and other stuff, here, Bay succeeds with one special truck (the rest is just ordinary cars with no special parameters) to create a memorable chase that will surely be quoted many times.<br/><br/>The finale is also nice and thrilling, the witty ""shite"" dialog is just pure fun and although you do expect the movie to end in this way, the path that leads to that end is quite surprising."
"whitelighter575","9","1","1","28 November 2006"," Ewan saves this movie
","I hate Michael Bay's movie as a rule. I gave this one a chance because of Ewan though and I'm glad I did. The action scenes were typically over-the-top and the story is decent but far-fetched.<br/><br/>So, I hare you all saying 'You keep dissing this movie, why the 7 stars?' Well, I'll tell you why. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. They were adorable together, people often missed the point that it's meant to be a bit awkward. Their acting is really good. the protagonists kill at least 30 people with little remorse, which was a bit odd. Overall, the movie it awesome because of the acting, decent producer away from being one of the best movies of all time."
"dylanbud","6","1","1","20 November 2006"," OK but some parts are disturbing
","OK so I was on on demand when I saw this movie was free on HBO so I put it on. Let me just say I almost puked at a couple parts. OK so it caught me off guard when I found out about the clones part but OK. I thought it was a cool little society. But when they stuck the tube thing into the body and all the blood came out I could of died I had to fast forward through it. Some parts of the movie were also totally irrelevant to the movie. But this movie was packed with action and adventure.It was future set, and the special effects were great. Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlettt Johannson were decent actors. Overall this movie is not too great its just an average sci fi movie"
"pascalveh45","5","1","1","30 October 2006"," Good start, bad overall.
","This Michael Bay movie starts quite well. Interesting idea's about the (near) future are shown and they are quite acceptable. The movie contains some ideas that also are in the novel Brave New World, such as learning while sleeping, although in this movie the clones get manipulated while sleeping but the essence is the same. The movie starts off as a convincing sci-fi thriller, but a soon as the 2 main characters (Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson) get out of the cloning facility the action starts. And that is what ruins the whole movie, the action is filmed nice with a lot of explosions, special effects and chases. But it's so unreal. The clones are meant to know nothing about the human world, things like car driving, firing guns etc. But suddenly they can, they explain it with a lame excuse which is that the clones suddenly started to learn and get memories. Its all nonsense to create action. The ideas from the beginning of the movie are all thrown away and what becomes is a action movie that offers nothing more than no-brain action. Personally i found Ewan McGregor quite bad in this movie, same for Scarlett Johansson (i liked her in lost in translation way better)."
"nctashiro","8","1","1","18 October 2006"," Remake or adaptation?
","I agree this movie has elements of the Matrix and especially of Logan's Run, but I vaguely recall a movie from the late 70s called The Clonus Horror or Factor. The only reason why I remember it is because the final scene shows a Lotus Europa. As a gear head, rare cars like that stand out. In Clonus, clones are harvested for their organs and two people find out the truth. I did a search of this movie, but descriptions were lacking.<br/><br/>In any event, The Island is a pretty good movie, with lots of SFX. Ewan McGregor is a very diverse actor. One can't help but wonder if he was thinking, ""didn't I do this in Star Wars?"" as he ran across catwalks. Scarlett Johansson is also a fine actress, not to mention so attractive, too! I loved her in Lost in Translation, a brilliant and under-appreciated movie, since not too many people are Japanese bi-lingual. I suppose one needs to be to ""get it."""
"Franco-LA","Null","1","1","15 October 2006"," Technically proficient but the story lacks:
","Conceptually, the movie has some interesting ideas, similar to much Sci Fi. As it takes place in the near future, it's not particularly science fiction as it is more fantastical. However, ultimately, it is an action thriller with many chase scenes, and not much else. Technically, it's exceedingly proficient. The performances are, generally good, although some of the talent is clearly underused. Ewan McGregor does an excellent job, especially when he meets the gentlemen who took out the insurance policy which underpins his role. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story just has far too many holes, not the least of which is the number of people involved at The Institute who would be aware of what was going on. If they had spent as much energy on the story and writing as they did on the sets and action sequences, they could have come up with a far better movie.<br/><br/>Generally, worth a quick look see if it's on TV or you wanted to rent something mindless, but if I had paid for a movie ticket, I would have been highly disappointed."
"ClartoGlogenwap","6","1","1","17 August 2006"," Never in my life have I been so certain that a different director could have done better.SPOILERS-
","***Possible spoilers!!!***<br/><br/>With such a fantastic story, a good director could have done wonders. However, a director who lets his/her vision get in the way of telling the story could make a chaotic and dragging piece that leaves one hating the producers for having chosen him/her. Guess which type of director we have here? The story is wonderful- A young man starts to wonder about his life in his subterranean hive-like society and whether everything is as it seems. The earth is said to have undergone horrible contamination and the people below its surface are the only survivors. The garish lottery in which people win trips to ""The Island"" (the one uncontaminated piece of land left) is the highlight of everyone's day. After some tense scenes that were done very very well, we find out that he is, indeed, not a young man. He is the clone of someone who lives on the surface. He is, euphemistically said, that person's ""insurance policy."" When one wins The Lottery, one is sent off with great fanfare but, in actuality, it's organ (or baby) harvesting time. The love interest then wins The Lottery. Of course a long chase ensues. Long. Very very long. It lasts roughly fifty minutes. Yes, 50 minutes. In a movie that is paced tightly, that would not have been a problem. This movie is not that. Only a better director could have managed that. This story would have been done supreme justice by Ridley Scott, for example. In fact, were I the screenwriter, I would never allow the producers to use my work again."
"dfranzen70","7","1","1","24 June 2006"," Loud, but fun
","The Island is a loud, superfluous cacophony of explosions and gunplay interrupted by quick bouts of sci-fi plotting. I half expected Tom Cruise to be the lead Action Dude, because forces conspire against Lincoln Six Echo, and his world is not as he thought it was. Shades of Minority Report! (One of the cars from MR even makes an appearance here.) And just about any other Tom Cruise vehicle.<br/><br/>But no, we get Ewan McGregor as Lincoln, and I think that's for the best. Lincoln Six Echo is one of thousands of people who live in an idyllic community underground. They've been told that the outside world was contaminated somehow, and they are the last survivors. And every evening, the community holds a lottery to determine which of the inhabitants gets to go to The Island, the last safe aboveground paradise.<br/><br/>Lincoln's been having some odd dreams, though, and he decides to Investigate, as hero types are wont to do, and he quickly discovers life ain't really all that idyllic, as he and the other inhabitants are clones for people in the outside world, clones that are being kept for spare parts or for out-and-out replacements, should the originals actually die. Now, if you were good ol' Lincoln Six Echo, what would you do? You probably wouldn't run to the head of the community, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), because he's obviously a bad guy. No, you'd grab your gal pal Jordan Two Delta (Scarlet Johannson), who's just won the nightly lottery, and amscray. And naturally, then all hell breaks loose as the fugitives are chased hither and yon.<br/><br/>Say what you will about most Michael Bay movies, that they're loud, incomprehensible babble masquerading as a seamless plot, but the movies can be quite entertaining if viewed with the right perspective. Bay uses his trademark pulsating soundtrack that coincides neatly with the on screen explosions to great effect, interspersing plenty of well-done chase scenes around such plot movers as the Helpful Friend (played here by Steve Buscemi, who's very well cast) and the Mercenary with a Conscience (played here by Dijimon Hounsou, from Amistad).<br/><br/>It's sort of like watching an amalgam of The Sixth Day, Minority Report, and Payback, with a dollop of Armaggedon tossed in as a dessert topping. McGregor is far better than Schwarzenegger, Cruise, or Affleck could hope to be, and Johansson does very well in a love-interest role, certainly doing more for the film than the film does for her. Also appearing is Ethan Phillips, who once played Peter on the long-ago TV series Benson, and Michael Clarke Duncan, another winner of the lottery.<br/><br/>So aside from the loudness and the sometimes poor writing, The Island really isn't all that bad, owing in no small part to the appealing, symbiotic performances by McGregor and Johannson.<br/><br/>The Island: ***"
"kybo25","9","1","1","14 April 2006"," a real surprise
","I thought this was a great movie. When i was looking at it on icontrol i wasn't really expecting much but boy did it change my mind. The movie is about these clones that people use for ""spare parts"" when two of the characters learn that they are not clones the action really kicks in. This was a relieving break from sci-fi movies like lord of the rings and star wars(both of which I'm not fans of) The Island reminds me of the book the giver and matrix and kind of Steven Spielberg's A.i. another one of my favorites. Overall i think anyone that enjoys a movie that really makes you think and isn't just a bunch of killing and stuff should see this movie. i give it a 9/10"
"eternalsea","7","1","1","28 March 2006"," One of 2005's most exciting movies.
","2005 has been a very good year for blockbusters. King Kong was superb in nearly every sense and War of the Worlds was also excellent. However The Island was another great blockbuster 2005 had to offer, but unlike the other two was overlooked and did poorly at the world wide box office. The story tells of two clones who are well played by Ewan Mc Gregor and Scarlett Johansson. They escape the facility in which they live and discover the real world. However Sean Bean who owns the cloning facility wants them back and sets out a batch of bounty hunters to bring them back. Like all Michael Bay films the films main attraction is large scale action sequences and here they can be found in abundance. It also should be mentioned that this is Bays best movie to date, and maybe his most exciting as well. The acting is very good by blockbuster standards and the dialouge isn't to bad either.The films big weakness is the lack of intelligence the story displays. Certain scenes make this so obvious that you yourself will feel stupid after watching them. To conclude the Island may not be the smartest flick of the year but its certainly a contender for most exciting."
"Daenelle","5","1","1","23 March 2006"," Amusing action sci fi adventure, but nothing special.
","There's nothing wrong with The Island, and I enjoyed the well-paced action scenes and special effects. But there's little tension and the plot is very old fashioned. There's only one twist and it comes early on in the film, so all you can do is wait for the inevitable happy ending with lots of cool explosions. Ewan McGregor gets all the good lines, but they are pretty few and far between, and poor old Scarlett is left largely in the bimbo sidekick role. They do their best with a lukewarm script, but it's not a gem. That said, the movie is hugely enjoyable after a few beers, and no one will complain they weren't entertained. But plotwise, it felt dated and I'd hoped for something a bit more engaging."
"Billoz","8","1","1","21 March 2006"," Excellent action movie with real issues at core.
","Cloning, harvesting, what makes for humanity, corporate greed, government involvement, slavery, brave new world, personal choices, welcome to the Island. If these issues need to be packaged in the most awesome sets, action sequences and technical wizardry to be explored then here it is. Very tight, unbelievably good score with sensational use of all 5.1 channels - you can feel the helicopters circle, the menace gather....Blackhawke Down, Gladiator, Mad Max, its all here. Some say the ending was cheesy.....yes, a bit, but also good. A ripper of a movie and hopefully one which will gather considerable status over time...."
"airgunner03","8","1","1","9 March 2006"," Extreme similarities to LOGAN'S RUN
","I truly found this film a work of art as far as cinematography goes and the FX were quite well done. The lighting and tones/colours, the ingenious use of contrasts served to enhance the overall sense of the film. I wonder how many people, other than myself, found this movie VERY similar to Logan's Run (1976/SF.) Take for example the names of the characters: Lincoln3E/Logan 5, Jordan2D/Jessica 6; the whole idea of living inside a controlled environment with NO knowledge of the outside world and the intense belief that ""outside"" was dangerously contaminated! Add to it escaping that situation and eventually returning to let the truth be known and set everyone free! To me the similarities were more than just pure coincidence- even the chase scenes in BOTH films with over head pipes, dripping water and confined spaces and a myriad of doors/directions to chose from. Was this the tumored remake of Logan's Run, sans name?"
"ApolloBoy109","9","1","1","28 February 2006"," Superb Action Sci-Fi Twister with great moments!
","From the first frame onward I loved this movie. Though others have said it was a well worn path we'd seen before in these kinds of films, I didn't care, mind or for that matter agree with them. This is a Saturday afternoon at the movies film with all the trimmings. Got it on Netflix and 24 hours later I bought it. It's one of those films you can have on in the background while you're messing around the house on the weekend -- clued into when the next cool scene will unfold, you take a break and watch it. I couldn't wait for the bad guy to get his. I was thrilled at the character development of the Security Officer. The action (or chase) sequences were top-notch. Perhaps I'm just a big boy and that's why I loved it. It did mix my favorite things together, there were twists and state-of-the-art bang-bang and I love that. As for acting--why were the critics so down on Ewan and Scarlett? They were believable and good enough to sustain themselves. So Mr. Bay you keep on trucking. Well written big ole dumb movie where you know the bad guys gonna get his!!"
"Anyanwu","8","1","1","14 February 2006"," Much better than what everyone was saying
","I don't know why this was so bad mouthed. Chase seen was what the chase seen in the Matrix should have been. Great music and sound design was superior. Often times action sequences are fortified by metal music. In this case the sound was great. For sci-fi it looked great. Not far out crazy but a realistic future. This is a great movie. For the most part each scene moved the story along. I am not a fan of Michael Bay fan at all, but this was solid film.This movie got shafted by the bad press. Unfortunately I did not get to see this on the big screen. If you get a chance see it their. The effects will obviously take greater hold add that with the sound the experience has to great.

"teng2315","5","1","1","18 January 2006"," like one long commercial
","This was one of Michael Bay's weaker efforts. I won't go into details about the plot but suffice it to say that it was very formulaic. The premise of The Island is a rehashing of several staples of the sci-fi genre. Yet, it could still have been an intriguing and thought provoking film but it was ""dumbed down"" by Mr. Bay into a pure action movie. By the way, there were so many blatant product placements that it felt like one long commercial. I would even dare to venture that some commercials have more substance than The Island.<br/><br/>Even his style is getting tiresome. How many times can he have a rotating, sweeping panoramic shot of the lead actors before we all get bored of it. Personally, I got a little dizzy at one point from all the up-close camera movement.<br/><br/>I'm glad I waited for this to come out on DVD instead of catching it in the theaters. To date, I still consider The Rock as Mr. Bay's best movie. Go catch that again instead of watching this."
"cariart","8","1","1","6 January 2006"," Derivative, Yes, But Served Up By First-Rate Cast...
","No one will ever accuse director Michael Bay of making cutting-edge films, but he certainly knows how to put on a show, and when you add a cast of first-rate actors, the end result can be great fun. ""The Island"", a 'concept' film that borrows liberally from ""THX 1138"", ""Westworld"", ""The 6th Day"", ""Coma"", ""Capricorn One"", and especially ""Logan's Run"", is basically lightweight fluff, the kind of entertainment where you bring out the popcorn and leave logic at the door. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; his 1998 SF epic, ""Armageddon"", is one of the most entertaining 'dumb' movies of the past decade. With this film, however, Bay has set the bar to a whole new level! <br/><br/>The concept, nearly a reworking of ""Logan's Run"", is intriguing, if shaky. A vast underground laboratory of clones created to supply replacement parts for rich clients is run by smoothly evil Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean, who seems to have a corner on villainous roles, these days). Juiced up with steroid mixtures to bring them to adulthood quickly (a system that is, besides being impossible, downright risky for anybody planning to USE the parts!), false memories are implanted, and the clones, at the mental level of teens, live happy, if limited lives, believing themselves survivors of an ecological disaster, and dreaming of winning the lottery (in ""Logan's Run"", it was 'Carousel') that will whisk them off to the only untouched haven on earth, 'The Island'. In truth, winning the lottery means you are about to be harvested for parts, but this is, of course, kept from them.<br/><br/>But Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), has nagging questions, fueled by sympathetic staffer McCord (the always entertaining Steve Buscemi), and when his best friend, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson, looking far too beautiful for a program where sexual desire is 'eliminated') 'wins' the lottery, he discovers what her fate is REALLY to be...and the pair escape into the 'real' world, pursued by an army of hit men commanded by Djimon Hounsou.<br/><br/>The chase is when the story really takes off, and it is as spectacular a series of stunts as has ever been staged for an action film. You may ask yourself how Lincoln is so proficient in driving skills (he can know these, instinctively, yet he DOESN'T comprehend SEX???), but if you don't allow logic to interfere with entertainment, you'll be in for a helluva ride! While the finale is another 'lift' (of the final scene of ""Logan's Run""), the characters are so likable, and the resolution is so satisfying that only the most cynical of viewers will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has done it, again!"
"vampirepirate","5","1","1","29 November 2005"," Unbelievable and farcical clichÃ©
","The Island is a fun action romp with an interesting subject and some fine talent behind it. Unfortunately, it's completely unbelievable and incredibly predictable. The sci-fi hocus-pocus behind the main premise is riddled with inconsistencies and has practically no basis in fact; the action sequences inflicted on the main characters put them through situations they could not possibly be expected to survive yet has them emerging with a few minor cuts and scratches; the evil scientist is a cut and paste megalomaniac lifted directly from a thousand other films; plot anvils thump into your lap with all the subtlety of a Schwarzenegger script. It's worth watching, but don't expect to be enlightened or educated."

","Sure, you can listen to the hype and believe 'The Island' was whack. Or you can go with your gut, as I did, see the flick and be damn glad you did so. The plot couldn't be more relevant (legislation occurring now & in the future will determine if the scenario in 'The Island' could actually happen), a good on screen chemistry from Ewan McGregor & Scarlet Johanson, a refreshing cameo appearance from Steve Buschemi, and of course the superb action sequences we've come to expect from director Michael Bay make 'The Island' an enjoyable, worth while rental. Also of note, a creative plot line where Ewan McGregor interacts with himself, and the fact that Scarlet Johanson looks amazing, as usual, makes this film a treat to watch."

","It's eye-catching that the movie comes out at a time where we start questioning the role of God-like geneticists in the stem-cell research field. The movie starts as an interesting sci-fi thriller- where a futuristic colony of people who apparently escaped from an over-contaminated outside world.In this Utopian everything is chosen for them-what they eat,what they wear,what they drink,do play etc.. The movie takes it origin from novels like like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, and Richard Adams's Watership Down. I am not a regular follower of the director so it may not be right to take a critical point against his directive capabilities but to be honest after an interesting start I thought I would see a really interesting movie something better than ""Equilibrium"" but you know after the introduction I saw it just turned like any other crazy action movie a movie which is actually a pastiche ""escape from dystopia"" which at one point turns and takes a downhill course as just with crashes and explosions galore.. I also found the product placement pretty stupid. MSN Search, XBOX, Puma and Nokia are some of the concurrent advertised products in a grossly open way.You may sponsor a film but you don't have to distort its image right?

","""The Island,"" directed by one of Hollywood's most loved/hated action director Michael Bay had all the ingredients for a summer blockbuster: it had a very expensive budget, top not special effects, an above average plot and great television ads and trailers. Unfortunately, it failed by studio and fan standards alike. In a summer where films like ""Mr.& Mrs. Smith"" and ""Batman Begins"" ruled the box office, ""The Island"" was sure to get it's fair share piece of the pie. This all boils down to the question of ""What went wrong with ""The Island?"""" Well for starters this film was a total departure for Bay, who usually gives his fans and the audience a lot of big-budget action extravaganzas every 1-2 years. Secondly, this film lacked credibility in casting two rising A-list(even though I didn't have a problem with it) stars in the lead roles. Maybe it was something on a deeper level. We'll never know why ""The Island"" didn't live up to people's expectations because there are so many theories we can choose from. I myself found it a pretty decent film but not better than most Bay films had been in the past. I admit, I'm a Michael Bay fan but I just couldn't accept the fact that it was not a typical Michael Bay film. You can call me crazy or whatever but I happen to like typical Bay films. In a summer where fans were surprised about how much on-screen chemistry Brad and Angelina had, one thing I will say is that I felt like Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson had better chemistry than Brad and Angelina. In my opinion, this movie wasn't terrible but I feel like this was the weakest Michael Bay film I ever seen to this date."
"D_la","5","1","1","17 August 2005"," No-brainer but mildly entertaining
","This could have been a really interesting film, a proper sci-fi film that raises questions, that asks about society and what we believe in.<br/><br/>Opening with Lincoln Six Echo on a boat, this film looks fantastic. Glossy, bright, cinematic and impressive, but everything that is good about this film is limited to the surface, but what else did I expect from a Michael Bay film? Lincoln Six Echo believes himself to be a survivor from some great contamination, where almost all of humanity was wiped out. The only purpose he and his fellow survivors have is to be chosen in the lottery and go to ""The Island"". But Lincoln is different than the others, he asks questions, he has strange dreams, and eventually he discovers the truth.<br/><br/>He, and all the others in the lottery are clones. Products used to replace their sponsors organs if and when they are needed. Going to the island is really going to get harvested.<br/><br/>I'm presuming you can guess what happens? He and Jordan Two Delta break-out and have a whole bunch of adventures in trying to escape the clutches of the evil Merrick and the mercenary-type team he has sent after them, headed by Laurant. Cue car chases, explosions, death, destruction, mayhem. You get the picture.<br/><br/>A fun, no-brain film that'll entertain you while its on, but you wouldn't really be bothered if you never saw it again. The problem for me is that it had possibility. Merrick, the doctor who created the clones, sees them as product, as soulless, as not human. They live their lives as they are programmed to do, quite happily until their trip to the island. But Lincoln is different, so surely that was an opportunity to make Merrick question what he is doing, to question whether or not the clones are as non-human as he had though. Instead the film simply serves up a stock bad-guy, who's really only in it for the money. And of course his own god-complex.<br/><br/>And lets not get started on the Laurant character who ends up being a good guy! I mean, are we supposed to think that simply because he helps Jordan and kills the baddies in the black tracksuits that that makes up for everything else? Sure he looks cool, but honestly..."
"philipsavory","4","1","1","16 August 2005"," oh not again...
","Dark gritty, sci-fi thriller it began. Daft, no-brain action it inevitably turned out to be. This film is basically a chainsaw disguised as a dictionary. The concept is great, but predictably Michael Bay just couldn't keep his hand out of his trousers and proceeds to blow it all over a series of over-edited action scenes, that are visually nice, but they feel unnecessary and sloppy. Bay done it all before and it shows, this was supposed to be a break from the Bruckheimer mould but ends up as the same thing.<br/><br/>The film begins quite well. Ewan Mcgregor plays Lincoln-Six-Echo a 'product' of Sean Bean's not so evil plan to prolong human life. He's not even a bad guy when you think about it, just a fool with a god complex, which is repeatedly established at needless points. Anyway Lincoln discovers 'The Island' is a fraud and does a runner with Jordan-Two-Delta(Scarlett Johansson). It is at this point that Bay, inexplicably removes the elements of intrigue that could've formed a good thriller. The moral ideals of cloning are never truly explored, nor is the idea of cloning being integrated into society.<br/><br/>The Island's vision of the future is unfocused. By 2019 we have floating trains and bikes, but no cars and buses. we can clone but wear the same design Puma's and drive the same kinds of cars (At one point I spotted a regular Volvo) What about fuel? Global Climate? This film is sloppy, because it took the audience for idiots (which we aren't, mostly) and aimed below the standards it could have achieved, which is what disappointed me the most.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I love action, but it's like Orange Juice, it's much better smooth and pure, than processed and stagnant.<br/><br/>Oh and look out for a dead clone who magically reappears at the end during one of Bay's many panning wide shots."

","From what I've heard, either you love this move, or you hate it. I wouldn't go as far as saying I hated it, but I also couldn't' wait for it to end.<br/><br/>This could have been a very interesting idea to revolve a movie around. That is if the movie wasn't being revolved around action. I really wish they would have dealt with the deepness of the idea of clones discovering they were clones(and all that entails) more. Instead I felt they were writing the movie for the action. The action is quite enjoyable(the car/truck scene on the bridge is very well done), but I enjoy a little more with my movies.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is good, not his finest moment, but that's OK. Scarlett Johansson adds a lot of depth to what could have been very vapid. Michael Clarke Duncan shines in his brief appearance, and Steve Buscemi is good as always. Djimon Hounsou(brilliant in Amistad and Gladiator) has been miscast lately(this and Beauty Shop), it wasn't a poor performance, but I'd like to see better for him. The real stand-out of this movie is Ethan Phillips. He was incredible. I hope to see more of him. Also, it was very nice to see the great Mary Pat Gleason.<br/><br/>Many will enjoy this movie.

Ewan McGregor plays the perfect ""innocent"", too, which is where much of the comedy comes from.<br/><br/>If you like to see things go *boom*, this film will give you the most ""bang for your buck"" that I've ever seen.

","Twenty minutes into The Island I had an epiphany. ""I paid six dollars to see a two and a half hour commercial,"" I thought to myself. While action and special effects can be entertaining, one must eventually be bored with them. Unless one is my boyfriend, of course. I, meanwhile, found a different way to occupy my time. It was a game called ""Count the items advertised in The Island"". I lost track at 23. Product placement minimally is fine, as in Spiderman 2 with Dr. Pepper or 28 Days Later. But when you notice the Puma shoes and the Audis and the Budweiser filling up your screen instead of plot, something has gone horribly wrong. Do yourself a favor and go to the mall if you want to be attacked with advertising of shoes and drinks and cars and clothing companies and colognes. At least this way you'll save some money and not be forced to watch Scarlett Johansenn try her hardest to act. Oh and by the way, blame Michael Bay for going millions over budget and resorting to the dreaded product placement."

Anyone, even considering going to see ""The Island"" in the future, please, do yourself a favor and take the time to go enjoy this wonderful movie. The camera angles used are genius, complimentary to the plot development and one cannot help but become enthralled in the story. Ewan McGregor is adorable as Lincoln 6 Echo, and the innocently beautiful chemistry between himself and Jordon 2 Delta (Scarlet Johansson) is so well portrayed, you can't help but want them to succeed. It was entertaining and engaging from start to finish.

","This Island is definitely a ride. The beginning shots set the tone for a fast paced movie. Since the plot is centered around the two main characters escaping their utopian type society and being hunted down, there are obviously going to be a huge number of chase sequences. The really cool ones are done with different vehicles and result in lots of explosions and destruction of the city.<br/><br/>Humor is also nicely inserted into the movie. Its usually centered around the clones not knowing much about the world, (understandable since they haven't been exposed to most of it) but its low key insertions make them funny.<br/><br/>While the basic premise has been done, The Island is very very good.

This movie is too long, not exciting, not funny, not anything. The script is horrible, the action scenes weren't even done well, and Michael Bay usually knows how to do them. Everything just sucked from the opening credits. It looks nice, but that's about it. Don't even think about buying the DVD, unless you want a $15 drink coaster. Bay should just stick to commercials, especially since this piece of junk is filled with product placement.

Which lets face it, there's just a few greedy people in the world. The action sequences are truly amazing and well worth watching in there own right. Caspien Tredwell-Owen has really excelled with the story and has came up with a very interesting story that consists of well known aspects of life but has used some enjoyable humour along the way. Especially the car scene with Ewen's clone and other character together. Michael Bay has done a superb job of taken Caspiens story and putting it on screen in a such a superb manner.

"Cryogenic","2","4","9","18 August 2005"," Michael Baynality Strikes Again!
","Michael Bay's latest cinematic infestation has, like his previous entries, a moderately interesting raison d'être, and unlike his previous entries, two talented and watchable leads. But don't let this apparent improvement fool you as it did me! Unfortunately, nothing is expressed with anything approaching true artistic conviction; rather, we get the usual subtle-as-an-elephant-standing-on-your-eye and atomic-bomb-exploding-in-your-auditory-canal approach to film-making that is central to Michael Bay's philosophy.<br/><br/>Opening on a boat and quickly segueing to Ewan McGregor's primary character lying on a bed, ""The Island"" hints at something halfway decent. The slightly unconventional feel and jaunty wit continues as McGregor exits his bed and relieves himself which results in a ""rebuke"" of a sort from a computer display (his urine is found to contain too much sodium). Then he scorns that he's missing a left shoe. Unfortunately, this darkly humorous approach quickly evaporates, and once the film has revealed its unoriginal but sly twist, the entire endeavour quickly careens downhill. As the film continues, it becomes clear that Bay is operating in familiar ""leave your brain at the door"" territory: a one-note megalomaniac (played competently but unremarkably by Sean Bean) is into legalised murder and will go to any and all lengths necessary to protect his secret operation.<br/><br/>If you're expecting a deep and profound character study of anyone in this film or a sobering treatment of the issues surrounding cloning and human oppression, then you've come to the wrong place. ""THX 1138"" and ""Blade Runner"" this ain't! Unfortunately, ""The Island"" even fails as a slick piece of Sci-Fi action in the vein of ""Demolition Man"" or last year's ""I, Robot"". A tepid screenplay doesn't convince us of anyone or anything. Take Lincoln's (McGregor's) monologue to Bean's ""Dr Evil"" figure. The monotony of Lincoln's life is communicated in his rant about tofu and white tracksuits but whatever limited humour it does convey is killed dead when Lincoln dryly pronounces he wants ""more than just waiting to go to the Island"". A couple of later scenes do hit the mark  look out for a cataclysmic misappraisal of euphemisms for visiting the toilet in a bar and McGregor's self-deprecating encounter with his ""real"" self - but these are about the only real highlights and enter the picture when it's long past saving. Just as damaging are McGregor and Johansson's screen presences. While they turn in competent portrayals, their characters are virtually devoid of depth or charisma and fail at ever making you care about them as individuals or their plight.<br/><br/>Stinking this film up and pushing it further into the twin realms of incredulity and vapidity are Bay's trademark assaults on the senses and sensibilities of film lovers everywhere. We get the usual flurry of jarring MTV cuts, rapidly spinning panoramic shots (enough to make you hurl), the obligatory black helicopters and more sped-up/slow-mo flourishes than you can shake a stick at. Poorly designed and staged chase sequences, replete with obnoxious quips, finish the equation. Worse still, we're subjected to some blatant and totally incongruous product placement. Considering ""The Island"" is set in the future, who honestly thought that ""X-Box"" and ""MSN"" logos would: a) still be around, and b) remain exactly the same as they appear now? If you're into false melodrama, stale characterisations, crude plotting and garish filmic execution, then ""The Island"" is for you. Everyone else should steer clear. Even red-blooded males and fans of Scarlett Johansson will likely be disappointed (Sofia Coppola's superb ""Lost In Translation"" has more to offer on this issue and countless others). Michael Baynality  go home!"

I remember several times during the movie where I almost started laughing because the dialogue was so awkward. At some points it was necessary to show the characters innocence and lack of knowledge but other times I found myself just wondering ""Why?"". The end was also painfully corny and unrealistic. I was wondering; ""Where are these people going to go? How are the going to get food and money?"" So overall if you want to go and see it and you think can stand listening to these characters in order to see a potentially thought provoking movie go ahead but I would recommend waiting for the DVD release to rent it."

If it gets deleted this time, I'll know something is up. Of course in the time since ""The Island"" the EXACT SAME THING has happened again, with Pixar refusing to admit that ""Cars"" is a remake of ""Doc Hollywood."" The more things change...<br/><br/>I haven't seen The Island, so I'm not going to comment on whether it's any good or not. But my question is this: how can the Screenwriter's Guild have possibly allowed the writers of the screenstory and screenplay of The Clonus Horror (1979) to be omitted from the credits of ""The Island"" (and also, I'm assuming, the $ that goes with that honor)? From the synopsis I've read it is the same story! And in many instances, the exact same story! Now, don't get me wrong--I think a big budget remake of something like Clonus is a good thing. The original had a good idea that the filmmaker's just didn't have the money or time to make into a good film. In fact, I wouldn't mind if Hollywood made more big budget remakes of low-budget flicks (""Race With the Devil"" 2006 anyone?).<br/><br/>No, what bothers me is this wholesale rip-off! The arrogance to not even acknowledge the FACT that your film is a remake in every sense of the word. Would ""based on an original screenplay by..."" credit have killed them? Would the money they'd have to have paid for the rights have taken that big a chunk out of the $120 million budget? I hope Clonus director Robert Fiveson and his screenwriters take this up with the Guild, or sue in court, and get some money and their names added to the credits for the DVD release."

Blaming Ewan and Scarlett for the lack of money it made was just plain stupid. The fact of the matter is it didn't' make money because it was marketed as an action movie. People went to see it to see action, not to think. Hence the reason why its doing good in Europe and overseas. That market likes an intelligent movie more so then the American public. I am not calling the American public dumb but they expect to get what they pay for and nothing else. They expected an action movie and when they didn't get it they ignored the reality of the movie.

"ctdias","1","3","6","31 December 2005"," Unfortunately, what I expected
","I actually heard this film was good. When you search the dictionary for the word or words that best describe over budget, plot less, bloated, shallow, hollow, and pretentious Hollywood movies, Michael Bay takes a full page spread. His films are full of clichéd, ripped off ideas with the editing and camera-work of a ferret on a double espresso. I had the misfortune to see The Rock theatrically and found it well written but a directed mess. I gave him credit for some style in Armageddon but found it the most ludicrous story ever conceived by man (and it cost how much?). I like pure action films as much as the next person, but half the time, I can't even make out what is happening in a Bay film. BUT I heard this one was better. I trusted Ebert's review. I may actually like this one... ...Thankfully my fears were dashed... ...Its bad. First there is a concept that falls apart with even the slightest amount of logical thought. As many reviewers here have pointed out, the concept of the film is so deeply flawed that it jars me out of enjoying the rest of the movie. It simple won't work. But what bothers me the most is the action. This is why we come to a Bay film. Then why is it such a mess? Once again the cuts are too fast and shake too damn much. I can't make out what happens 30% of the time. The stunts are good and some of the crashes are pretty. I didn't spend two hours watching this films for 30 seconds of stunt work. It forces participants in battle to act like morons. <br/><br/>If the Wasp can fly around, why is it skimming the ground and approaches the truck bed from a blind spot? Why doesn't the truck driver notice this mayhem and stop. I assume it's automated. Okay...I'll give you that one. <br/><br/>What is the truck carrying? Train wheels. I'm sorry, didn't we see trains moving WITHOUT wheels 20 minutes earlier? Sure...Maybe ""freight"" trains still have wheels, but we all had a laugh at that one. <br/><br/>And this wasp barrels through a building and bursts out the other side. Given the strength of Earthquake proof outer windows, even if they could crash through the other side, they would not drop ""straight"" down onto the big sign. Then the Helicopter spins around and gets SOOO close that the signs falls on it, destroying the helicopter. And no human being should survive that fall. Convenient net or no convenient net, they are dead. <br/><br/>And how does this action scene begin? With a police car being cut in two by an armored truck. Notice something? Why did the police car stop in the MIDDLE OF THE ROAD! There were no cars in front of it. It wasn't turning. What the hell...its only there for on rea--or here comes the truck. <br/><br/>Hmm...The police cars were all Dodges. The bad guys all drove Magnums. Is that the Cadillac super car? I cannot stand the obvious product placements. When there is an extended shot of an Aquafina bottle, I wonder how much they paid. A Utopian society with Xboxes? Yeah, I'll take it. <br/><br/>And if the subjects need to be alive and conscious to have their organs viable, why don't they clone pigs with human organs? Sound disgusting? Their developing it, folks. <br/><br/>Didn't realize Lincoln could imitate a perfect Scottish accent after hearing it for 20 minutes. And I love Djimon Hounsou but his sudden turn to good at the end is dumb. Its sudden and totally unrealistic given his openness to kill anyone else he saw. Jordan's on a swing set...gets captured instead of killed. Okay...they need her organs. Didn't bother frisking her. That's smart. They are being chased through a door. Lincoln closes the door...Oh, a convenient pipe to wedge the door. I should send that to Ebert. ""The convenient pipe brace."" They hop on the Wasp and Lincoln figures out how to fly it. A 20 second learning curve with someone with the IQ of a fifteen year old. Hop on a bike if you have never ridden a motorcycle. Figure it out in 20 seconds...now make the bike fly. They chase them with armored cars and dodge station wagons. After they are all destroyed, they call in the flying bikes...NOW they call in the flying bikes. Pulling on a single lever destroys the holographic generator. Good to know these people don't make nuclear reactors. And how did any of these guys imitating police get away. I mean... <br/><br/>...I really gave this film a chance, folks. I thought I might actually like it. After 20 minutes...I wasn't getting that vibe yet. Michael Bay needs to understand that more and more people are demanding some intelligence in their movies, even in the action genre. What bothers me here is that The Island could have done that. It had the potential. Some foresight could have made the action more cohesive, more comprehensive. The story could have plugged its holes. The actors...so good...and they will be good again. This film failed at the Box Office...badly. I hope this is a message to Bay and the people that finance him that viewers demand a higher quality from their films. Bay needs to step up, or step aside. Pearl Harbor, Armageddon...they made money, but I don't know a single person who likes them. I know many of you do. Maybe there is an audience for Bay films. I am not part of that group. I am proud not to be. Moving on. <br/><br/>(It should be noted the day I saw Armageddon was the dame day I saw Out of Sight with Clooney and Lopez, directed by Sodderberg. After watching 'Geddon, I realized I wanted to see Out of Sight again. Big budget, a good movie does not make)"

I even like Ewan McGregor in this movie, and he is not one of my favorite actors- i.e., if you have seen the new Star Wars movies, you'll know what I mean. The plot is fluent and understandable, and even the comic relief was well placed and effective. Scarlett Johansson puts in a great performance as a clone on the run, and Sean Bean is awesome as Dr. Merrick. I am a tough grader who has seen just about every sci-fi movie made-see it!"

They are very unsubtle and don't really fit into the film at all - its shameful. Aside from that the story is weak, tired and painfully linear. Having seen Minority Report and I Robot, this film just feels like its repeating the same sort of boring idea - ""what if they could do this in the future? Imagine the moral consequences..."". The car crashes are reasonably entertaining, but again these just seem pointless and repetitive. All in all it has the feel of a standard Hollywood blockbuster, which it is, with nothing original or exciting."
"marciosn22","10","3","6","27 October 2005"," The motion picture of a life time
","Hi, everyone! Just after seeing this motion picture in the theaters, I knew I have experienced the most deep and sensorial movie I've ever seen. From the wide, panoramic scenes that opens the movie, magically coupled with the deepest background music imaginable for a human theme, to the outstanding ending sequence, THE ISLAND is a more-than-rare experience, it's in fact unique. Right from the start, we are introduced to a major starting argument, very touching, very poetic, very deep and very human. People living inside a utopic or not (depending on the point of view) society, without free will or individual condition. And there is this guy, Lincoln 6 Echo, superbly played by Ewan McGregor. Coupled with Johansson's character, they deliver magnificent acting. In much less time that it could be possibly imaginable, we find ourselves involved by this two wonderful characters, by their friendship, child-like (very sweet, very pure) way of going through things, by their dramas. And just before we realize, we find ourselves in a rare situation in a movie: we care about the main characters. Yes, we care. That's the term. We want them to win, to free themselves, to find their way. That's something, my friends, very few movies offer. So, we got amazing, superb, major acting from all main characters, a very strong science fiction theme with a incredibly touching human condition, a theme music that fits so perfect to the movie that will breathe eternity to every single shot, ground-breaking special effects, the strongest storyline I've ever seen, and Michael Bay taking his place side by side to the greatest filmmakers of all times like Spielberg and Cameron. So, after seeing 8 times just in theaters, I could easily say it's the greatest motion picture I've ever seen. No other film has touched me this deep, no other film looked so poetic, human, or strong as THE ISLAND. Thanks Michael Bay, Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor, I just wanted right know to thanks you all for delivering the motion picture of a life time. Thanks a lot, really."
"meger_7","6","3","6","12 August 2005"," This ISLAND is no mirage
","When is comes to sci-fi shows on TV, I usually turn the channel and watch something else, but a sci-fi flick is a totally different ballgame. Where TV can only go so far, movies take it to the extreme, which is why I have adored films like MINORITY REPORT and THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK in recent years. It's these blown-up sci-fi/action flicks that really get the blood pumping, because it's not just an ordinary action flick. There's usually a fairly compelling story to go along with it, which makes for something fun and intriguing to watch on the big screen. That's what gets me into the theater to watch and why films like THE ISLAND are successful in my book. The reality to any sci-fi flick is the fact that it is far-fetched and probably unlikely, even though it is set so many years in the unknown future, but that's exactly the reason why sci-fi films make money and create a fan base. And for that, I always look forward to a new story that will most likely blow my mind, good or bad. So, before you get on the bandwagon of bad reviews and press for this film, take a step back and just watch. Because it's not about the unreal special effects or action sequences, it's about the innovative story that makes you think and wonder ""what if?"" Usually when it comes to most sci-fi flicks, the cast isn't the most important piece to the puzzle. But, after watching THE ISLAND, I have to give the producers and director Michael Bay credit for casting Ewan McGregor. I think if nothing else, this story needed someone that could pull off acting cool under pressure, but still seem distant from the truth that was going on around his character. McGregor (STAR WARS: EPISODE I, II, III, BIG FISH) does that and does it well, showing that Scottish swagger that has made him so popular in films like this. But, McGregor did have some help in Scarlett Johansson, who not only is beautiful to look at, but is also cool under the collar, showing off that innocent yet confident nature that made her Jordan Two Delta character the most fun to watch throughout. And seeing Johansson (LOST IN TRANSLATION, GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING) let loose and kick some butt was neat to see and something I would have liked to see more of in next year's MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 3, which she was slated to be in before pulling out several weeks ago due to production delays. But, I guess for now we'll give her ""props"" for this role and McGregor too for a job well done in a film where acting traditionally takes a back seat.<br/><br/>As expected, the special effects and action sequences in THE ISLAND were pretty insane to watch. In fact, I would go as far as to say they were some of the best I've seen in recent memory, which doesn't by any means belittle WAR OF THE WORLDS or even FANTASTIC FOUR, but the action and special effects in this film were a tad different. The trick with THE ISLAND is coming up with action and special effects that carefully hover over the line of realism, and for the most part director Michael Bay did that. Sure, the principles behind the effects might be a bit far fetched, but the action that unfolded was just as fun and real as the action sequences that made both of Bay's BAD BOYS films so popular. But, the trick to this film was the molding of Bay's action to the story, which I must say, was done quite well when it was all said and done. And yes, believe it or not, there was one scene that pushed the envelope of realism, but that's what makes Michael Bay unique. He manages to throw all the action he can into one scene and still make 90% of it believable, a feat few directors attempt.<br/><br/>THE ISLAND may not reach stardom like it's close predecessor and classic LOGAN'S RUN, but the pure combination of intense action sequences and a story that makes you think works well. Going in, I really didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with a film that was not only fun to watch but also engaging at the same time. So, despite some flaws here and there, overall THE ISLAND is the most detailed work to date for director Michael Bay and a film I would recommend seeing if for nothing else the pure entertainment it oozes of.<br/><br/>B"

"astronic","4","3","6","10 August 2005"," Dull, unimaginative and missing far to many good opportunities
","OK, this one contains spoilers, but if you've seen the trailer, you know the whole movie already anyway.<br/><br/>Much has been said about Michael Bay's talent (and especially the absence of it), and basically ""The Island"" adds nothing substantially new to this discussion. If you really want to see another action flick of the nice-production-values but braindead-screenplay kind of type, or if you're 13 and have never seen any decent sci-fi film, then go ahead and watch this movie.<br/><br/>Otherwise be warned:<br/><br/>1) The movie makes no attempt to actually show us how the society inside the facility works, nor why it has been designed in such a way. You'll only get very short glimpses of everyday's life, which mostly serve to provide some cool scenes and not to bring us to a deeper understanding. ""Logan's Run"", a movie which certainly has its flaws, did a much better job here by just showing us examples of everyday's life and different locations. In Michael Bay's film however, the society merely exists to get the action started and is nowhere near being believable.<br/><br/>2) For what seemed to me like an eternity, there are action scenes, we have seen a thousand times in exactly this way. Maybe some people can't get enough of them, but seeing choreography taken from ""action films 101"" just bores me. Don't get me wrong, I really like action scenes if done properly like in ""Wo hu cang long"", ""The Matrix Reloaded"" or hell maybe even ""Resident Evil"" (bad special effects aside). But having to look at yet another car chase with yet another car explosion and yet another (or two anothers to be precise) hanging on a rope above some abyss sequence is not what I'm willing to pay any money for.<br/><br/>3) The screenplay is flawed, really flawed and this destroys what's left of the illusion of disbelief. Super trained seals just forget to take the gun from somebody they arrest, in the unavoidable who's-the-clone-and-who's-the-original scene they not only shoot the wrong guy needlessly (they could've just distinguished them by asking a simple question like ""what kind of drink do you get from a cow?"" because the clones are really clueless about the real world), no, nobody even bothers to check if the killed person has a signature on his wrist like every clone does. Oh, and you constantly wonder why characters won't use the technology they obviously have and why such a futuristic high-tech facility is designed so poorly, that people can walk around in areas they're not supposed to be without being noticed, while wearing wristlets that makes them locatable anytime and while even small delicts like coming to close to your friend are detectable. I could go on for hours...<br/><br/>4) It's cheesy. Cheesy like ""professional killer suddenly finds his conscience and turns against his employer just 10 minutes before the movie ends"".<br/><br/>5) As you probably know the movie is rated PG-13. I've yet to see a good PG-13 rated action film, but they could've at least tried to make it tough and sexy in a PG-13 compatible way. Unfortunately they didn't, so this is far too tame and (despite Scarlett Johansson) absolutely not sexy.<br/><br/>6) The camera is moving and shaking in over 99% of all shots. Using this technique in action scenes wisely may indeed help to create suspense, but shouldn't be the only means. Using it in nearly every action and non-action shot however, is inducing headaches and makes oneself wonder if the camera operators were on drugs.<br/><br/>7) It hurts to see so many great opportunities wasted. This story done right could really make a great movie, asking questions about the value of cloned life versus non-cloned life, showing us how the lead characters adapt to an alien society (in this film they just do out of thin air) or elaborating on how physically adult persons, who have never even heard of love and sex find out about it. Furthermore this movie is far to linear (there were opportunities for some fine plot twists which Michael Bay obviously just ignored) and it's not even a good action film. The society outside the facility is as boring as it can get in science-fiction (it's basically just like today with a few technical gadgets thrown in), and most of the action scenes could've just been taken from S.W.A.T. or some James Bond movie.<br/><br/>Overall you could say that his movie is just dull, so it is pretty much in line with Michael Bay's former work. Unfortunately."
"brenttraft","4","3","6","31 July 2005"," Anatomy of a Flop
","After 2 weeks of release, The Island looks like it will probably the biggest flop of 2005. Where did they go wrong? <br/><br/>1. The director, Michael Bay, specializes in mindless action films like Bad Boys and The Rock. Letting him make a film that actually has a plot was a big mistake. The directing is sloppy and does not have much thought. While that works for lots of films, it does not go well with science fiction.<br/><br/>2. There were no well known actors in the film. Ewan McGregor is a decent actor, but he does not have the presence to carry a film. Scarlett Johanson has done very well in quirky independent films, but she is terrible in this action film.<br/><br/>3. The script is poor, despite an interesting premise. The dialog was so dull, I cannot remember a single line. The mindless chase scenes got boring and were not credible. <br/><br/>4. There was about 10 minutes in the middle that had a few jokes, but otherwise this film was done with a straight face. It wasn't good enough to be a serious film and it wasn't fun enough to make it as a popcorn flick.<br/><br/>If ""The Island"" keeps it's place as the biggest flop of 2005, it serves the movie studio right for not putting any thought into such a big budget film."

","I really enjoyed this movie. It was beautifully shot. The story is great and the acting/performances were outstanding, especially Ewan McGregor. He did a great job playing the clone and the sponsor, of which both had very different personalities. He looked really good in that white tracksuit. This is definitely one of the best Michael Bay movie. There are of course action parts that are quite unbelievable but they were wildly entertaining. However, in the end, it was intriguing and thought-provoking and brought up many issues surrounding the ethics and morality of human cloning and the effects of greed mixing with science. People complain about product placement but what's the big deal? All of us use most of those products in real life. So what if they wear Puma runners, would people be more happy if they wore unknown runners? I didn't feel that the product placement detracted from the essence of the story and the great performances of the actors. Great movie! I highly recommend it."

In my opinion, you don't really care about the characters at all. It's more about the special effects than anything else. I'm tired of these movies whose main focus is on CGI than story. If you are interested in seeing this movie wait to rent it on DVD. Heed this warning or suffer from absolute boredom and disinterest.<br/><br/>Finally, I believe and I may be wrong the movie takes place in 2019. If that's the case the world is going to make some incredible technological advances with railways in the sky and flying motor bikes. Perhaps I heard the date wrong but this was far from believable. I don't see these types of advances in the next fifteen years."
"puddinstreet","4","3","6","24 July 2005"," 30% The Giver. 18% Brave New World. 2% Ape and Essence. 50% Minority Report ripoff
","When I first saw a preview for this movie a few months ago, I thought it looked great, despite my skepticism of Michael Bay's direction which has led to atrocities in the past. However, I realized that Jerry Bruckheimer was not attached to the project. This led me to think maybe Michael Bay would come out of his shell and prove himself to be a great director with multiple skills... I was wrong. This movie is a rehash of many great stories about future dystopias stuck together to form the basis for yet another Michael Bay action movie. The first part of the movie is intriguing in its implications and opens up a million possibilities for allegory and a very interesting plot that uses the present controversy of cloning and human rights, totalitarianism, etc. and places them into a future environment for an objective and relevant study. Not to mention the characters had a lot of potential for development. I was let down on all these fronts as all the ingenuity of the first few scenes dissolved into a Minority Report inspired chase film, where plot and story development are replaced with car and futuristic flying motorcycle chases, along with a couple neat shootouts with strange grappling hook guns.<br/><br/>Now this film did have some memorable moments. The most effective is Michael Clark Duncan's scene in which he wakes up in the operating room to realize he is not going to the island. His brilliant acting combined with some uncharacteristically effective cinematography made me tremble in fear while bringing me close to tears. Unfortunately this is the high point. What else to say of this film? The action scenes are as solid as one would expect from a Michael Bay film, but for all i'm concerned, he just took clips from his other films and edited them together slightly differently. He has his action formula so tight that it has looked the same since Bad Boys. I do give him credit for being as minimal as possible with CGI as this sort of movie would allow. Impressive set pieces and practical effects give this film a greater look of reality than, say, Pearl Harbor. Other than that, the dream subplot of the film is lame and cliché, as is the end of the film. Steve Buscemi was wasted. Scarlett Johanssen is beautiful and slightly intense. Ewan McGregor is playing his role so effortlessly, using his typical style of acting that he employs in films he obviously does not have any passion for besides his pay check. He could have been switched with Jude Law doing the same thing and no one would be the smarter. When will there be another film the quality of Trainspotting that will allow Ewan to remind us that he is a brilliant actor and has been riding the A-list due to his extraordinary talent, and not just his Russel Crowe-Lite looks? Not in a Bay film, I'll tell you that much."

Bay has finally reached the next level in his directorial career.<br/><br/>This is arguably Bay's best film. Although it does still have his signature brutal action sequences, character based comic relief, and mass vehicle destruction, it seems that he has found and held onto the deeper meaning in the source material here. <br/><br/>Slick direction, beautiful cinematography, and fresh performances by the talented cast make this one of the summer's most underrated and hopefully appreciated screen gems."

And, it proves that Bay doesn't need Bruckheimer in order to make a good film.

I, myself, liked it very much. It adds to the whole concept of clones being created to supply body parts for when the client needs it.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor delivers another amazing performance. He plays Lincoln, the hero of the film. His ""best friend"" is played by the beautiful Scarlett Johansson. While the film delivers in its action sequences and interesting storyline, the flaw is in the romance. The clones are denied sexual contact and when McGregor and Johansson escape they begin to discover their sexual arousals. This portion of the film should have probably been explored more. Nonetheless, the film is a popcorn film and I feel its a good one. If you liked Bad Boys and The Rock you'll dig this film.<br/><br/>RATING: 3 STARS (***)"

Not to give away the story, I can only say these: The concept is good and scary, there are lots of car chase and blow ups. But the actions are kind of redundant and repetitive, and there are just too many plot holes, maybe because the characters were not well built, the actions they took came as unnatural and not fitting their character.<br/><br/>Kind of disappointing."

"DICK STEEL","9","7","20","18 July 2005"," A Nutshell Review: The Island
","This review is brought to you courtesy of a movieXclusive.com preview session, without which I won't be able to write this so soon.<br/><br/>The Island is the latest summer blockbuster offering from director Michael Bay, who brought to you other loud actioners like Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, Con Air and Pearl Harbour. But what's different in The Island is his departure from long time collaborator Jerry Bruckheimer, and an attempt to explore a bit on human morality and ethics.<br/><br/>While I won't say that this exploration is thorough, it does invoke some thought when you're watching the film. As you would've already known, this movie is about clones. What if science and technology allows you to live a little longer, replacing body parts which are failing you, a kidney, a lung, from none other than something which has the exact biological make-up as you. This insurance policy, the product, will definitely be clinically compatible, and at your beck and call anytime. Will you proceed with buying into this product, even though it'll mean the birth and subsequent death of some other ""you""? Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) live in a sterile environment, the Facility, where everything from your outfit to the food you consume are meticulously provided for. Survivors from a contaminated ""outside world"" are brought into the Facility, to live and work in until such time they win the Lottery and get themselves brought to the last paradise on Earth - The Island. Or so they thought. It's fun looking into the Facility, with its minimalistic Zen like decor, and the technology used to monitor and control its inhabitants look straight out out Spielberg's Minority Report.<br/><br/>But when Lincoln learns the truth of the setup, he brings along his best pal Jordan in an escape from bounty hunters and the law (ala The Fugitive), while at the same time trying to look up their owners in an urban futuristic looking landscape, to explain this truth. And here's where director Bay is at his element, with loud action, explosions, and a tad of explicit violence.<br/><br/>At times, the action pieces brought some sense of deja-vu, from Matrix (the building-windows-helicopter-smashing scene), to Star Wars (the jet-bikes), to an amalgam of elements from his own Bad Boys 2 chase scene (where they dump bodies at their pursuers) fusing into mass mayhem similar to Matrix Reloaded's freeway chase. Signature quick-cuts and camera-panning-around-actors-upper-torso-in-slow-mo remind you that this is action done Bay-style. Of course at times, one must suspend your disbelief when loopholes and improbable luck inadvertently play a part in non-stop action.<br/><br/>McGregor seemed to have a lot of fun in his role as Lincoln Six Echo (no worries, the naming convention does get explained). You might have thought that his exhilaration at motorcycles was real (yes, you might also know that he had travelled round the world on his BMW bike), and I felt his using of his native Irish accent and American accent to distinguish between his characters was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is a beauty to behold. Her Jordan Two Delta has tough as nails spunk, as well as a touch of femininity and vulnerability in her character. The development of her love for Lincoln looked right out of Blue Lagoon, given that the clones have an intelligence equivalent of a 15 year old (or so the makers thought).<br/><br/>The supporting characters like Steve Buscemi (another veteran of Bay's movies, given some of the best hilarious lines in the film - listen out for his cow analogy), Djimon Hounsou (who presented a meaner, leaner, younger version of Samuel L Jackson's mo-fo attitude), and main baddie Sean Bean all give commendable performances in an action movie. Don't expect too much character development, but they played their stereotypical role to a T.<br/><br/>Product placement's a fun thing to spot, from Puma, to Microsoft's XBox (I want one of those!), MSN, Calvin Klein (oh when will Johansson star in a real one?) and of course, Nokia (I was wondering when this would appear). Somehow they didn't feel jarring from the scene they're featured in, as some helped facilitate the plot somewhat.<br/><br/>While techonology and science may offer us a chance at the elixir of longer life, we must be careful with it and not attempt to play God, in deciding who lives, and who does not. While one may have noble intent, delivery and execution (pardon the pun) of that intent matters.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Island. Good things do happen."

I have to really be interested and excited about the film to even consider it, the last sneak preview I attended was 'Team America: World Police"". I have got to admit that I was kind of psyched about seeing 'The Island'. It was a cool-looking and intriguingly filmed action-Sci-Fi that was almost kind of a remake of 'Logan's Run' with a cast of solid performers. Usually, when you go see these kind of 'Michael Bay' summer blow-em-up action blockbusters, they star popular and beautiful movie-stars who can't act worth crap, like Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman or Penelope Cruz. But, 'The Island' was superior in a way where the two stars were Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson, two incredible actors who are two of the best of their generation. Walking into the theater screening 'The Island' I was expecting to view a good film, and by the time the end credits started to roll, I realized I had viewed a great film. I guess you could say I was a little impressed.<br/><br/>The story follows a group of people who have codes for names. They live in an enclosed area called 'The Insitute', they wear the same white jump-suits with white sneakers, and the biggest priority of theirs is their health. They are told they are survivors of a major end-of-the-world type contamination and it's important for them to stay fit, and they also have a lottery. If you win the lottery (chosen at random) you get sent of to 'The Island', a lush and beautiful sandy beach area where you'll live in glorious luxury the rest of your days. One of these people, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) starts to have nightmares about being taken to 'The Island' along with a girl he likes, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson). The nightmares consists of them going to the island, but being killed before they reach it. Lincoln Six Echo is haunted by these terrible nightmares night after night and decides to snoop around the institute of which all his fellow machine-like citizens live in. He eventually finds out a terrible truth - THERE IS NO ISLAND! Everyone he knows and sees everyday in the plain white jumpsuits are actually clones of people in the 'real world'. When a person in the real world gets sick, their clone mysteriously wins the lottery, and gets killed and operated on for whatever organ the real sick person needs. Lincoln Six Echo decides to escape their enclosed prison and takes recent lottery winner and love interest, Jordan Two Delta with him. Pursuing them is a team of bounty hunters lead by the quiet and hardened Laurent (Djimin Hounsou - In America, Amistad), hired by ruthless and calculating Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean - National Treasure, Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring), who created the clones. Jordan Two Delta and Lincoln Six Echo are helped by McCord (played by the hilarious and incredibly talented Steve Buscemi), who's maintenance worker at the institute who had befriended Lincoln Six Echo. The movie begins a wildly entertaining cat and mouse game with so many twists, turns and car chases it will leave you breathless.<br/><br/>I have to say I was very impressed with 'The Island' mostly because it was from Michael Bay. For most of his career I thought Michael Bay was to film-making as McDonald's was to hamburgers (that's not a compliment in the slightest). He was the big name who directed all the big blockbusters, but he had no real sense of flair or passion. I felt he was very commercial and unoriginal in his directing until having seen 'The Island'. Bay, for the first time, provides us with intelligent as well as extremely engrossing entertainment (part of which may be due to Hollywood mogul Jerry Bruckheimer not producing the picture). Along with being pleasantly surprised with Bay, I thought McGregor and Johannson were almost perfect in their roles. They provide us with the feeling of their emotion and make us believe they are actually in danger and anxiety (something that untalented Hollywood hacks - who usually get cast in these kinds of flicks (Tom Cruise, Orlando Bloom, Justin Timberlake, etc.) - could never do.) Steve Buscemi provides perfect comedic timing with his role, and recent Academy Award Nominee Djimin Hounsou is very solid in his. Sean Bean was average at best as the diabolical doctor (I still think they could have cast a finer performer in his part), and Michael Clarke Duncan is dreadfully awful in a small role (fortunately for the viewers). For all the good 'The Island' posses (decent acting, decent directing, awesome action sequences that will leave you in awe) it has some faults as most films do. The screenplay is a little dull and flat-out silly at some points, and I strongly disliked the ending (it felt too rushed and it took a path I felt should have been avoided).<br/><br/>In closing, 'The Island' is a very good film, despite it's flaws. I think the reason I liked it so much is because it's so superior to other movies in it's 'big blockbuster action adventure picture' genre. It sets a high standard for the same type of films that will follow it, and I admire that very much. 'The Island' thrills you, makes you laugh, makes you think and entertains you consistently. Really, what more can you ask for in action movie - besides an Oscar worthy plot, not really much else. Grade: B (screened at AMC Desert Ridge 18, Phoenix, Arizona, 7/09/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

","The Island was a very exciting adventure, full of action and wild car chases or more crashes. Ewan Mcgregor gave a fabulous performance and as always Scarlett Johansson looked great and was great. The jokes were funny, some people were laughing in really random parts that's because it was a bit lame sometimes. I think this movie will do well because people have some fascination with clones. This movie points out that it really isn't ethical to clone people. The Visual affects where really good and the fight sequences where loaded with blood. Some of the fighting and car chasing was not possible and you did not believe it but it was exciting non the less. Some parts where corny but if you chose to go along for the ride then you will enjoy it."

","Yep, I caught a preview of Michael Bay's new film The Island over this weekend, and to say I was unimpressed is an understatement. I realize that Michael Bay is an over the top director, but it seems every movie he does is the same.<br/><br/>The Island, is about cloning and focuses on two characters, Lincoln Six Echo, played by Ewan McGregor, and Jordan Two Delta, played by Scarlett Johansson.<br/><br/>The film's premise is that these ""clones"" are working in a utopian society, when they are really part of a harvesting project that creates clones for high paying users.<br/><br/>The films action sequences, such as a freeway highway chase are somewhat exciting, but the storyline is predictable and completely unbelievable. Never once did I find a shred of believability in this film.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor, terrific in the right roles, just doesn't seem right for this film, and Scarlett Johansson isn't quite believable or ready for action films yet, in my opinion, she should stick with independent films, where she completely shines! With many other great films this summer, I would best say wait for The Island on video.<br/><br/>A 3 on a scale of 1-10."

","***Spoilers***This movie is basically a rip off of a movie produced in the late 70's called ""The Clonus Horror"" which starred Peter Graves and a number of well known stars from the seventies era. I thought when this movie came out that it was a remake of this earlier movie. I was surprised to learn on IMDb that ""The Island"" was made with no one looking back to the past to see if something else like it was ever made. Both movies have almost identical plot lines, characters, and themes with ""The Clonus Horror"" at least having the saving grace of nude scenes that are much better than the so called sex scenes that are found in ""The Island"". Makes one wonder how many recent releases that are just veiled remakes of earlier movies."

","The Island is the type of movie you look forward to seeing after paying $10.50 per entry at the cinemas these days. It's action packed, there's romance, there's comedy, and there's the realism to it! Could you possibly ask for more? Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor, play two genetic clones who get way ahead of themselves when they realise their true identities and go on a quest to try and right the wrongs that they and their kindred have been dealt and deluded into believing. The premise of rich people investing in human clones of themselves, being kept in an secret underground lab somewhere safe for the rainy day is not only barbaric and scandalous, it makes an excellent plot for a movie which Michael Bay snatched up and is presenting to you in this film. You can never put anything past the powers that be, especially when it comes to finding the fountain of youth. The Island is a must see for all!"

However, after that it just got worse and worse and on and on. Another movie that should have been shortened by 50 minutes. The action scenes were dull and how dumb is the commando leader who loses most of his troops to a clone and then could care less about it.

The atmosphere is quite amusing and the whole background idea of a world within a world where you create human beings for medicine is just brilliant. For me, Scarlett Johansson plays her role beautifully and charming. Sean Bean never played better and even Ewan McGregor fits wonderful in his role as Lincoln Six Echo. The plot is not predictable and there are a lot of surprises in this movie you wouldn't have thought of when watching the movie. The whole story is very touching and it makes you think about the world you live in and whether you are like Lincol Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta. <br/><br/>I would strongly advise everyone to buy it when it comes out on DVD.

"RimDur","2","3","7","24 August 2005"," No news from Michael Bay
","I cannot grasp how anyone can claim that this movie is ""Michael Bay's first intelligent movie"". There is nothing intelligent in it. The first half hour is promising - but suddenly Michael Bay notices the total absence of explosions. Enter: action, explosions, chases, special effects, fast editing and one-liners. Exit: the script, a believable story and the respect for the viewers intelligence.<br/><br/>This movie is just a horrible waste of money and time. The only thing worth mentioning is the cast. Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansen, Djimon Hounsou, Sean Bean and Steve Buscemi try their best to make their lines work but they are left clueless by bad directing, bad editing and most of all a horrendous script.<br/><br/>I am puzzled how this script got approved - if there ever was a script? The plot holes in the script are of gigantic proportions and I assume that any intelligent person reading a script with those kind of plot holes would spot them instantly. I mean, you can park a dump truck in most of them. Let's look at a couple.<br/><br/>* The clone project cannot be subject to any kind of government control since it has been possible to break the very basis of the clone law - the clones are not kept in a vegetative state. When you consider the controversy of cloning now and probably also in 2019 I find this very hard to believe.<br/><br/>* It is pure bullshit that organs cannot function when people are kept in a vegetative state. It is possible to keep your body alive and thus all organs functioning for decades even though you're braindead. Remember Terry Schiavo?<br/><br/>* The clone project has been kept a secret even though thousands of real people work there. It is fair to assume that when you have that kind of secret and that kind of people knowing it, that it would leak to the press at one point.<br/><br/>* Why on earth would you build an outside staircase that leads directly to a tile in the floor in the very hallway where you murder the clones? No guards, no obstacles. Why would you build such a thing - unless you want the clones to see that you are actually killing them.<br/><br/>* How could no one in a crowded hallway notice that a tile in the floor was misplaced? For crying out loud - there was a big black hole in a white floor.<br/><br/>* With that kind of money invested in the project, it is quite strange that it is so easy to escape for Lincoln and Jordan. I mean, when you have a 200 billion dollar budget, shouldn't you be able to afford a few guards, maybe even a gate and a fence? <br/><br/>* Why did Lincoln have to throw train axles off of the truck? Michael Bay could have chosen any huge metal objects - but instead he went for the one thing it couldn't be: train axles. Minutes before we just learned that trains in 2019 hover using magnetism. Idiot.<br/><br/>* Why didn't the truck driver notice that he was being shot upon and was losing his entire load of train axles? How is that possible that you don't notice that your truck is going from weighing 50-60 tons to just 10 tons? Impossible.<br/><br/>* How was Lincoln able to both drive a car and a wasp (the airborne motorcycle)? He has no experience whatsoever. Oh, you're saying that those experiences originate from the real Tom Lincoln. Bullshit. How come Lincoln the clone didn't know anything about stopping at red light, sex, kissing, etc. - the sorts of thing you as a person stacks up in the experience department? Actually Michael Bay is saying: ""Lincoln Six Echo just got the part of Tom Lincolns experience that I (Bay) thought he should use in the movie"".<br/><br/>* The Djimon Hounsou character suddenly becomes a good guy after he had no second thoughts shooting half of L.A. to shreds. Oh yeah, sounds believable.<br/><br/>I really could go on - I still have a dozen plot holes - but I think you get the picture. In short: this movie stinks.<br/><br/>The two stars it gets from me is one for Scarlett Johansen's stunning looks and one for the first half hour before Michael Bay literally blew everything up - including the movie itself."

I read the rave reviews here and I finally decided to watch this movie.<br/><br/>The exposition is quite long but interesting. Nice production design although clichéd. Good actors like McGregor and Bean. But as soon as the chase begins it's all typical Bay: ultra-fast cuts, long crane and helicopter shots, slow-motion shots of the heroes, Zimmer-like music, ridiculous action scenes like the one on the R logo ... well, in short: BORING ! And as always there are scenes that make me (and not only me) cringe like the kiss scene or the final scene on the hilltop (slomo-on-acid).<br/><br/>It must be me but I never watched a Bay movie that sucked me in story wise. Too much cliché (as the bad black guy that converts instantly from bad to good) that makes me laugh, too obvious camera shots that shall make me think WOW. It's the story, stupid !

"jhs39","5","3","7","23 July 2005"," Dopey action thriller
","Big budget action flick about a young man and woman in a Utopian society whose only purpose is to be as healthy and fit as possible before winning a lottery to go to a paradise called the Island, the last inhabitable place on the planet is for all practical purposes a remake of the low budget thriller Parts: The Clonus Horror, which had an identical premise and many of the same plot twists. Strangely, The Island supposedly isn't a remake of Clonus, which means a lawsuit is likely. I'm generally skeptical of plagiarism suits in Hollywood--everything has already been done and there aren't any truly original stories left to tell, but in the case of The Island the thievery of Clonus is so blatant that the people who claim this is an ""original story"" deserve whatever they get. How is it possible that The Island got approved and filmed and marketed and released without a single involved party noticing that their movie bore a troubling resemblance to another film that was previously released theatrically, shown on television (and ridiculed on MST3000) and even released on DVD? Didn't people who make 120 million dollar Hollywood B movies watch B movies themselves as kids? Well, somebody involved with the story and script for The Island clearly did, because the similarities between The Island and The Clonus Horror are too great to be a coincidence.<br/><br/>Of course, that doesn't address whether The Island is actually any good. Clonus had a clever premise but lacked the budget and talent to pull it off. The Island has all the money and talent anyone could hope for, but as a movie it really isn't any better.<br/><br/>The problem is that while the premise is perfect for a provocative and intelligent thriller, the director is Michael Bay of Armageddon and Bad Boys 2 fame. Bay doesn't make intelligent or provocative thrillers. He makes mindless big-budget crap where stuff gets blown up. Lots and lots of stuff.<br/><br/>The Island starts off great, even if the early scenes feel like they've been largely lifted from the earlier film, but as soon as the action leaves the confines of the facility where the clones live and enters the outside world the action scenes kick in and the movie gets dopier and dopier, leading to a happy ending so cringe inducingly awful you just know Steven Spielberg had to have a hand in this somewhere. Who wants to bet that if Spielberg had produced or directed Armageddon Bruce Willis would have somehow gotten off the asteroid alive? Spielberg could never resist a tearful reunion between Willis and his daughter. The botched endings to Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Minority Report provide all the proof anyone could need. The ending for The Island isn't just bad, it's Spielberg bad, it's the kind of happy ending that ignores all of darker implications of what came before for superficially uplifting images that make little narrative sense and completely insult the intelligence of the audience.<br/><br/>In the case of The Island we have one character who spends the entire film causing mayhem and killing innocent people changing sides (that's going to make me forget all about the civilians and police he and his men killed in pursuit of the clones) while the clones themselves escape to freedom at the top of a mountain. End credits. Hurray. Everyone leaves happy. No wait, the cold-blooded mercenary looks at the clones escaping to freedom and smiles, suppressing a tear in his eye. Now everyone leaves happy. (Unless like me you leave nauseous).<br/><br/>Of course, none of the clones knows anything about the real world and it would be interesting to find out how the world reacts to the news of what was going on in the lab, particularly since the clones are all of people who are rich and influential, including the president. Would there be a scandal? Would the government cover everything up? Would the government hunt down the clones or leave them be? Would the clones try to find their sponsors or take over their sponsors lives since they are identical and have many of the same memories? There are so many interesting directions that The Island could have gone in, the fact that it ultimately turns into a mindless explosion fest is more disappointing than usual. Bad Boys 2 never really had the potential to be anything other than what it was, a mindless big-budget action comedy destined to make money but be forgotten as soon as it left theaters, but The Island could have been a classic. Instead it just feels like another Michael Bay movie."

","REVIEW OF ADVANCED SCREENING OF ""THE ISLAND"" <br/><br/>""The Island"" was one of the most inventive, actionous, creative, entertaining, captivating movies that I've seen in a while. Its most likely going to draw comparisons to ""Minority Report"", and on a shallow basis, it is similar.<br/><br/>But ""The Island"" is one of those movies that astounds you as you watch. Its vision of the not-too-distant future is cool and high-tech without being a little too CG like in ""Minority Report"". It is realistic, detailed, and truly amazing.<br/><br/>I do not want to go into details about the plot or setup. This is the glory of the movie. Even elements of the plots that aren't twists should stay secrets before the film's opening on July 22, simply because of their sheer coolness. The fun of the film was going into knowing nothing, because everything about it is a wonderful surprise, from the plot, to the set, to the acting to the action, to the spectacular set pieces.<br/><br/>And DO NOT let the Michael Bay reputation put you off this film. I don't know what happened, but this is not only his best movie, but one of the best action thrillers I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Go, see ""The Island"", and don't read much about it, watch too many clips or ask people who've seen it about it. While the plot is not distinctly new in terms of Utopian thrillers, the execution of the film, with its mega action AND gentle human relationships and ethical discussion, is something very unique in this summer's stream of mediocre films. I thought ""Batman Begins"" was OK, a step above the rest of the series, and I was thoroughly entertained in ""War of the Worlds"". ""The Island"" however got my pulse pumping, and sucked me into the lives of the characters - it is rare that I CANNOT stop saying to myself ""I can't believe how great this is"" during a movie. The only other movie I did this in was ""Minority Report"", until the last 20 minutes, which, like most Spielberg films of late, fizzled. Comparing both films, ""The Island"" was much more suspenseful utterly and completely gripping and rewarding. It also has its share of laughs and shocks. Although the film is PG-13, you wouldn't notice, even with its lack of blood, because it carries countless scenes that evoked gasps from the audience - good gasps. I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>From this review you know very little about the film - and thats a good thing. Be surprised, and let the film take you in - with sympathetic characters, wonderful writing, some good humor, great action, and even a good finale, ""The Island"" is something I will watch over and over wondering why Michael Bay wasted his time on ""Pearl Harbor"" when he could have made three ""Island""s by now. And no, it doesn't even need a sequel, and the ending doesn't demand one like ""Batman Begins"" or ""Fantastic Four""...but you'll want one anyway, its that good.<br/><br/>An easy 10/10 P.S. - If you didn't already know it, Scarlett Johanssen is freakin hot, and Michael Bay takes full advantage of that fact ;)"
"dbborroughs","3","6","19","3 August 2005"," Uninteresting retread marks Michael Bay's total creative collapse
","Michael Bay's films have been on a decline pretty much since he's started making films. After Bad Boys they've all decreased in quality. Sure Armegeddon is a guilty pleasure but its a dumb movie. Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys 2 exist for the action sequences. The Island however has no reason to exist since even the action is unexciting.<br/><br/>The plot starts out as on odd mix of Logan's Run and Soylent Green before turning into just another twisty chase movie. The problem is that there is nothing we haven't seen before. And while there are a few interesting bumps, they are the exception to a very dull movie.<br/><br/>I blame this on Michael Bay, a director who it seems has a limited palate. His use of filters and quick cuts and very precise action sequences has been done to death by Hollywood and especially by Bay himself. Once our two stars escape and end up in the city I began to feel I had seen it all before. I could sense what the next set up would be and which way the plot would twist. Worse the normally exciting action sequence that Bay puts together fall flat. THere is no sense of rhythm, and the normally quick paced Bay somehow slows everything down to a very dull point, or he seems to. Cars are crashing before me and I want to hit the fast forward. Even here in the action sequences Bay repeats himself. Its awful. Actually its just dull.<br/><br/>This is a lavishly produced film thats just no fun to watch. I can't recommend it. Maybe it will be better on TV or cable but in the theater this was an endurance test I never want to take again."

The head of the facility hires mercenaries to track them down before they can expose his secret to the world.<br/><br/>(Comment) ""The Island"" is an adventure movie filled with high-intensity action scenes of car chases, crashes, and buildings blowing up. The special effects were terrific and exciting, even though they were hard to believe. In one of those scenes, they fall 20 stories off a building and only end up with scratches. The line the construction person says is a funny one. Another thing that was hard to believe is the fact that they were novice runners, yet they were able to outfox professional mercenaries. I thought the movie's storyline was current, especially during this time with the debate over stem cell research. The concept of cloning is thought provoking, and an ethical one for the medical community and the public. You may leave the movie with an answer to a moral question, and see a good movie.

The clones live in a police state that is straight out of 1984. One such clone (Ewan McGreggor) discovers the truth and escapes with his closest friend (Scarlett Johanson). Thus ensues a series of car chases, foot chases, and jetbike chases, any attempt to make the movie mean anything is completely thrown out the window in favor of big explosions, death defying feats, and more chase scenes.<br/><br/>This wouldn't be all bad but the supposedly elite forces tracking down the escaped clones (ex delta force, S.W.A.T., and other special forces operatives) display remarkable amounts of blatant stupidity and incompetence. Time and time again the untrained, uneducated, sheltered clones best the goons sent after them and escape only to be tracked down so they can escape again. The movie has a natural end almost a half hour before the movie actually ends, it would have cut down on the mindlessness of the film and might have actually raised a few interesting moral questions. Instead Bay insists on the big Hollywood happy ending with the giant fight scene between the hero and the villain with all kinds of explosions and gunfire to accentuate the anti-climax. The Island didn't have to suck, but yet it does."

","If you know the premise (well, the movie has been advertised extensively) half of the movie is just plain boring. It takes more than one hour to explain what lies behind 'The Island'.<br/><br/>If you don't know the premise, the first half of the movie is boring all the same. The clean polished Brave New World setting doesn't engage the audience beyond some curiosity and subsequent too-slowly-built suspense.<br/><br/>Lincoln 6-echo and Diana 2-delta have the mind and bland behavior of a 15-year old in some Mormon drama (see Twilight). How is empathy supposed to be building for such uninteresting characters? There's the usual gigantic outbursts of Michael Bay trademark action, but the continuity is anemic.<br/><br/>IMO the movie would have had much more dramatical/suspense potential (and would have cost much less) if the story concentrated on one/two sponsors confronted with the product they ordered. Better characters, better drama, and action unfolding from the very start. Michael Bay thought he had an actioneer with much substance this time, but he barely understands substance against action, thus The Island seems to be drifting away for 2 hours, only following the stream of its very interesting premise."

","Congratulations Michael Bay! I think all critics who panned this ought to be ashamed of themselves. They see Michael Bay's name and think 'oh great another expensive stupid action flick.' This is an unfair judgment and even when i saw a film by Michael bay come up in the opening credits i had my doubts but i kept watching and i was rewarded. It is people like Michael Bay that make these sought of movies that are rewarding in what they are offering which are good effects, occasionally (in this case) an interesting story and also to a lesser extent good acting (McGregor and Johansson were terrific). He gave us Transformers which I thought was fun and he gave us the Island which I thought was even better. Firstly I am shocked that this movie was not nominated for at least best visual effects and best sound mixing and editing would have been appropriate as well. I know the effects don't come close to King Kong which won but they sure beat Narnia and War of the Worlds. And the sound awards were both won by King Kong as well. BIG MISTAKE! I liked King Kong but enhancing the volume of an ape roaring and beating its chest is not Oscar worthy! As well as this the score was so good! Steve Jablonsky is officially the most underrated musical composer ever. He should have won an Oscar by now if the Oscars were not so biased to sci-fi movies because his score was terrific. Should see!"

","What is essentially an otherwise good story of the struggle man endures simply for freedom is tarnished by Bay's insistence of blowing up everything in sight in the process. McGregor, in typically consistence form begins to realise that his Utopian yet oppressive futuristic bubble is merely a front for a big a larger scheme. But his journey is punctuated by mind-numbing action that detracts so much from the actual story that you forget what you were watching in the first place. Scarlett Johansson's character, in a similar position; has very little to do other than scream and have sex with McGregor. Sean Bean, is the vindictive scientist who provides some (and the word 'some' is stressed) reasoning to the film. Whilst it had potential to be good, it merely falls under average as what plot is simply destroyed by Bay's eagerness with a fuse."

","Skittering along at a rapid clip, ""The Island"" is ridiculously enjoyable. It seems rather silly to catalogue the film's inconsistencies--the whole brainless, derivative adventure is designed to be a thrill-ride, and serious film-buffs would be well advised to check their b.s.-detectors at the door. After the world has apparently been contaminated, survivors are rescued and taken to an underground, totalitarian society where men and women are virtually separated, dressed in all-white, and given droning jobs; they are also entered into a lottery which promises to whisk the lucky winners away to an island paradise to live out their lives in splendor. Naturally, one male ""product"", a deep thinker, challenges the rules, asks a lot of questions, and quickly comes to believe the whole set-up is a fraud. High-tech updating of ""Logan's Run"" (with perhaps some overtones of ""Coma"" as well) could be subtitled ""There Is No Sanctuary!"" There's an amusing preamble, but one senses early on that director Michael Bay cannot wait to dispense with the pesky formalities--he just wants the guy and his girl out on the open road with helicopters swirling overhead and bullet-ridden cars piling up on the freeway. The plot is actually worked out rather neatly, but Bay's scenario is crassly junked up with violent action and stunt work--so much so that we lose touch with these characters (this is a movie where it's easy to lose your bearings, as the whiplash editing keeps plowing ahead until not even the surroundings make sense anymore). Strictly as a popcorn fantasy, the film has its pleasures; there are funny bits spread about, and also the occasional wipe-out line (as with Ewan McGregor asking 'himself' if he's still a virgin). Incredible special-effects, an engrossing set-up, fine performances and a satisfying finale make ""The Island"" decent fare, but can anyone really recommend it without smiling out of shame? **1/2 from ****"
"unclejay73","8","2","4","22 August 2007"," Bay's redemption...
","Do not believe any of the critics and do not be misguided because it's a Michael Bay flick, ""The Island"" is a very good movie; action-packed, well crafted and good sci-fi.<br/><br/>It's 2019, the population is very small and it seems to be confined into a large facility controlled by scientist Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean). Apparently, the Earth has been contaminated and those who live in this confined, Utopian society are considered fortunate. Everyone except the doctors and guards wear the same clothing, their diets are controlled, their knowledge is minimal and sexual attraction is prohibited. But there is chance for a fresh start. Twice a day there is a lottery, where a selected person wins a trip to The Island, a contaminated-free paradise where a new start on life can happen, helping to rebuild the environment and restore society.<br/><br/>Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor, just off of ""Star Wars Episode III"") is curious. He wants to know why society is the way it is. Why is everyday planned out for him. Why is he being controlled. He also suspects that something wrong is amidst. He tells all this information to Dr. Merrick who finds this behavior very interesting, and unfortunate. Of course, things get a little deeper when Lincoln's gorgeous best friend, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), has been selected to go to The Island. After some investigation, Lincoln discovers that there is no Island, only certain death. All who have been picked in the lottery, seem to face some sort of medical treatment followed by death. Lincoln locates Jordan and tells her what he's discovered and after a successful escape from the facility, both 'fugitives' find out that there's nothing wrong with the outside world, and find themselves in the middle an Arizona desert. <br/><br/>Merrick then calls Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou), a special enforcement agent, to track down our two heroes. With the help of McCord (Steve Buscemi), an employee of the facility, Lincoln and Jordan realize that they are, as well as the whole society at the facility, clones, created by Dr. Merrick with the intention of adding an additional lifetime to the average human being. When a body part, organ, tissue or such ages or no longer functions on the human body, a replacement is taken from their 'ordered' clone. The clone is then terminated after the operation, but Merrick manipulates the clones to think that they are going to The Island. But the clones are people too, with human feelings and emotion, and Lincoln wants to put an end to Merrick's operation. McCord helps Lincoln and Jordan get to Los Angeles, to search for their sponsors (the original hosts), or any means of help. But Laurent's posse is hot on their tail...and the action commences.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is an action-packed thrill ride. It's no doubt that Michael Bay is a great action- director, but he tried too hard to become the next James Cameron with ""Armageddon"" & ""Pearl Harbor,"" and the ""Bad Boys"" films are just terrible. This is the Michael Bay that gave us ""The Rock,"" this is Bay's redemption. <br/><br/>Reminiscent of ""Logan's Run"" and ""THX-1138,"" mixed with Bay's trademark action and visuals, ""The Island"" is a well-done, solid sci-fi film."

","This movie is consistent with the majority of the action flicks being produced by Hollywood. It is so formulaic that writers can write it in their sleep. I am all for suspending disbelief in a science fiction movie, but I don't think we will have the technology in 20 years to create a full-size adult clone in four years that is educated to a high-school level.<br/><br/>Somehow Ewan McGregor's character knows how to drive a car and a jet-powered flying motorcycle, even though he has never seen one. Somehow, he knows how to use a credit card and cash.<br/><br/>The draw for a movie like this is the special effects. They are spectacular. Absurdly spectacular. Our heroic duo fall 30 stories while helicopters and metal rain down on them. All involved are doomed, except these two.

The whole team must have really concentrated not to use EVERY idea from Logans Run, I bet they would have loved to use the term ""runner"" for example, but you know just one more similarity would have tipped this film over the edge as just another Logans Run remake.<br/><br/>It certainly isn't really an original film, but saying that, it is enjoyable although you can predict virtually every move.

Nevertheless they outwit numerous security guards; the heads of the clonemakers; the LAPD in 2050; and a ""special unit"" composed of ex- ""Delta Force, Navy Seals, CIA, ....""

"KingMFreak","4","2","4","24 May 2006"," Three viewings = disastrous movie
","The first time I saw The Island, I found it to be an interesting movie, with an excellent premise and fun chase scenes. On a second viewing I was bored to tears by it but still recognized it as okay. And now I have viewed this movie in an Essay Fundamentals class as a parallel to the book we're reading, Brave New World. And, viewing it with people who hadn't seen it, I was entertained again, but the movie annoyed me to no end.<br/><br/>I was surprised by the sheer lack of people in my class who had not yet seen or even heard of this movie. Hollywood really needs to step up their advertising campaign, especially since this movie is so ridiculous that it entertains on a low level. Product placement is in no shortage, as we see advertisements for Aquafina, Xbox, and MSN Search, to name a few.<br/><br/>The story, in case you don't know, involves a society of people who are told that they are the lucky survivors of a global contamination and they are awaiting passage to The Island, nature's last remaining paradise. And now I'm going to spoil the rest of the movie. In reality they are clones whose sole purpose is to live, awaiting the island, until their sponsor, or identical person in the real world, needs their assistance with organ transplants or a new heart. The idea is to extend your life for the price of 5 million dollars.<br/><br/>One clone, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), figures out the truth and escapes the complex with his best friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) and spends the rest of the movie running from the baddies.<br/><br/>What really pains me about this movie is that it could've, I repeat, could've been a terrific movie. It could've been a chilling sci-fi parable of our desperation to live longer, and to some degree it achieves this. But the endless chasing of the two characters in the second half is hard to sympathize with, as we see endless innocent bystanders getting mowed down by Lincoln's antics.<br/><br/>The other thing about this movie is that the trailer reveals precisely that McGregor and Johansson are clones, that the Island isn't real. Good job, marketers, now I don't care to see this movie. The only draw is Johansson, who is a beauty to look at, but whose lower set female voice provides with a hoarse scream that doesn't fit the bill of damsel in distress. Especially when she kicks Lincoln's ass at an Xbox game (which in itself is flawed because the clones are supposed to be conditioned to be nonviolent, and don't video games promote violence, especially Kung-Fu fighting ones?), and then cringes in the background as Djimon Hounsou folds his arms and sweats, helicopters flying overhead.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie and read this review and got to this point, then I wouldn't bother seeing the movie. The twist is given away in the trailer (and in IMDb's plot summary), almost like The Truman Show, which my friend saw under the conditions of not knowing what was going on. He loved it. If you skipped to this paragraph and didn't read my review and don't really know anything about the movie, then it is worth a see."

If anybody would ever create such a stupid billion dollar project like this cloning factory it would be more cruel and not as risky as this. But the really scaring point is that this movie is the best example for what it's warning of, the striving for perfection. What we watch is a perfect, absolutely perfect visual entertainment but what we feel is absolute emptiness because of fixing the emotional and superficial impression. i was so scared realizing that i shall be influenced by tools the movie wants to denounce. so thank you mr. director, thank you mr. author/screen writer for an evening of cognition. Now i fear you, not the clones, corporations or the greedy and insatiable millionaires. everybody who is interested in this kind of theme will be disappointed by the way of telling. things are going from bad to worse: this movie makes you to recognize people going happily out of the cinema as deplorable. this makes me sad."

Once you learn the true identity of the film itself, which is imprisonment of clones, so that rich people can harvest internal organs, the movie itself becomes dull and most importantly: SO PREDICTABLE; combat of good versus evil, in which we all know who prevails. I was rather disappointed, knowing that the idea behind the scenes was promising and had a lot of unexplored potential. Comparison could be made to The Matrix, the legend of science fiction movies and the outcome would be somewhat harsh, since one rocks and the other stinks.

""The Island"" suggests cloning is legal and ethical in the year 2019 and some are cloned, born only to provide insurance replacement parts as needed for others. Winning the lottery means their organs are suddenly required to keep someone alive who has earlier paid for their own clone. Winners of the lottery go willingly to their end believing they are to live in the only paradise left on a supposedly contaminated Earth, (Clearly Bora Bora from the pictures of the ultimate prize), but of course are killed for their needed body parts. Enough with the product placements! But I think I gave up on The Island during the Cadillac commercial near the end. 750 horsepower?

You aren't doing too well, under a constant threat of attack, and the higher ups, are living off your misery.<br/><br/>THX-1138; Absolutely a classic and George Lucas first full length film.

This movie is beyond good, it is a GREAT MOVIE - equal to the likes of ""Army of 12 Monkeys"" and ""5th Element"".<br/><br/>The problem with this movie was the cast, which although is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT, but failed to attract an audience. It also lacked the necessary 'spook-level', especially in the commercials, which also caused the audience to be lost. I believe by the very nature of the movie, it would have been extremely easy for director to introduce enough spookiness and that alone could have helped it become a hit movie. It has tons of exhilarating action sequences, yet watching the ads you wouldn't know it was an action-packed movie.<br/><br/>Despite all the sci-fi, the thrilling action sequences, this movie is totally entertaining, with enough comedy to make you laugh as well. However, most importantly, the reason it deserves high praise is that this movie also has HEART. It would move you to tears. It would compel you to think. Someday this movie would be used in debate regarding cloning. Kind of movie where you have to think hard to find flaws and you come up empty.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johanson plays a clone of a Model and that is great because it preserves her beauty forever at her absolute prime. Ewan Mcgregor is great and the movie could not have been cast any better.<br/><br/>When the truth is revealed about the purpose of their existence it is truly shocking and heart-breaking.<br/><br/>I love the two main characters, especially Scarlett Johanson, the ease with which a complicated plot is handled, the suspense, the innocence of characters, the heart that this movie shows, and I totally love the ending, especially the last scene.<br/><br/>This movie will form a Cult following for sure."

One of their number, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) has become curious and started questioning their reason for being. So when Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) 'wins', they spring an escape- only to find the island security hot on their trail. It is on their escape that they learn of the shocking truth for their being and the deadly implications it now has.<br/><br/>I know I've got problems with a movie when it's been on for, what, fifteen minutes and already the plot just hasn't grabbed me- and that was definitely the case with The Island. The plot opens and it's really just a case of how? what? and who?, because it's all opened with the subtlety of a sledge hammer and you're not sure of who anyone is and what they're meant to be doing. All you see is a bunch of people wondering around in white suits like they've lost the top of their costumes and have wondered off the set of a Durex commercial. You really get the impression that Bay didn't care about the plot and just wanted to dream up any old hash to make a movie that would rake in big bucks for the summer. With a story this uninteresting, it's little wonder that the film's length (130 minutes) becomes a little too much and it all feels a bit too long.<br/><br/>At it's most intelligent, the story seems to be having a stab at consumerism and how in the future corporations will be able to sponsor anything- but it came far too late in the plot to make me care about the it any more, there's plausibility issues with it anyway and it seems to be owing to past such films like Blade Runner in some ways.<br/><br/>Performances wise, McGregor does a good American accent, but even his usually charismatic presence can't save this. As his co-star, Scarlett Johansson looks pretty but doesn't make much more of an impression. The supporting players are pretty useless. Steve Buscemi shows up and just does his usual edgy, guy trying to rationalize everything act he's been doing since Reservoir Dogs, as does Sean Bean as the no-nonsense bad guy. Djimon Hounsou is just.....Djimon Hounsou.<br/><br/>With all this wrong with it, you count on the action scenes to save the film, but even they fail to make an impression, shot too closely and with too much of a grey camera shot.

","This is one of the worst films I have seen lately. Its just the usual clichéd rubbish from Hollywood cashing in on the fear that human cloning will cause all sorts of unethical and immoral behaviour in the future. There are three main gripes I have with this film. The first is an absurd piece of escape-artistry on the behalf of the script writer to get himself out of a hole. At one point we discover that the companies investors are told that the clones are only grown as vegetables, and never achieve consciousness. However, for some ""scientific"" reason that they don't understand the clones have to reach consciousness and run around aimlessly for a while or the organs wont survive in their new hosts! What a load of crap, in fairness. Secondly, the use of product placement in this film was nothing short of shameless. I cannot abide having company logos (not even bloody products at times, just logos) emblazoned on my television when I'm supposed to be watching a movie!!! Companies such as Puma, Microsoft (MSN & X-Box), Tag-Heuer, Mack, Cadillac....etc. all had more significant roles in the film than Scarlett Johanssen, who was suppose to be a major character. At one point in the film McGregor and Johanssen are in a phone box talking behind an MSN logo on the glass, totally galling. This has to be the most extreme case of cheap subliminal advertising I have ever seen and I am sure has the opposite effect to that which was intended on most sane people. Thirdly, as a member of the scientific community (and particularly a geneticist) I find the pathetic megalomanic, misguided ""mad-scientist"" in this film quite sickening. How many times have we seen it before? How many times do we need to see it? <br/><br/>Basically I am saying, steer well clear of this movie and steer clear of any of Michael Bay's movies because they probably wont get any better."

Bing bang boom, he takes the female lead--ooh, what is Scarlett Johansen working on, loved her in Coppola's thing--and they escape into the real world. We put in a guns and guards chase scene so people won't ever realize the plot is weak.

The next two hours is basically: big explosions, special effects for their own sake, bad guys die, good guys survive, and everything is explained to death so as to spare you any thinking. And the ending is just dumb.<br/><br/>A huge disappointment."

I guess like some pop songs these days, doing ""remakes"" is acceptable if your audience is so young they don't know that it's a remake.

","This movie looks like a recipe. You take one helping of Logan's run, mix it with a little Equilibrium, rip two measures off the Matrix and borrow some images of the future that look like I, Robot (which in itself looked like something else.) When you mix all these ingredients together, you have the Island, part human, part machine. The first half is the human part.<br/><br/>We see the world through the questioning eyes of Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), inhabitant of a Big Brother style world of forced tranquillity. We feel his annoyance at things like restriction of Alcohol, meat bans due to forced health regimes, even restrictions in clothing. We discover the secrets of the world around him as he does. We know that the sinister Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) knows more than he lets on. In short, we, the audience, are mildly intrigued. Yes, this looks like something I've seen before after the many Philip K Dick adaptations of the post Wachowski era, but we'll give it a chance. Maybe this will go in a different direction, maybe Michael Bay's breakaway from Jerry Bruckheimer was just what he needed.<br/><br/>So, Lincoln Six Echo uncovers the secrets of the world he has been placed in, that there is no ""Island"" where all the inhabitants are promised they will end up by way of winning a lottery, and that each person sent to the Island ends up dead. Six Echo escapes with lady friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlet Johanssen) to the outside world where Dr. Merrick and his cronies give chase. It's here that the film turns to machine. I won't reveal any more plot even though you'll guess it from this point in the film anyway. It's as if writer Caspian Tredwell-Owen (who sounds like a character in the movie) gave up on his original idea halfway through and just said ""Sod it, lets just make it predictable Hollywood fare."" We know what Michael Bay's movies are like. This was marketed as a departure for Bay, new and interesting, but audience members must feel cheated now. This is a by the numbers Bay action movie. The characters are Threadbare, the script is stilted. In the second half there must have been pages and pages of dialogue that simply read ""Hold on!"" ""Look out!"" and ""Aaaaargh!"" The action sequences look like the leftovers from Bad Boys 2 and the excellent freeway chase. The movie is far too glossy for it's gloomy subject matter and would have been better served as the mood piece it was marketed as. It also thinks it's so clever it comes out looking dumb and predictable. I give this movie 3 stars because the first 40 minutes intrigued me and Steve Buscemi provided comic relief in a fun cameo. The rest had me looking at my watch and actually begging for it to finish. I like Michael Bay movies in general, but this one tried to convince me it was something else, and it didn't work even a little bit."

A ssssslow mmmmmotion shot of characters looking at one another very slowly doesn't make me care more (or at all) about them.<br/><br/>At least Michael Bay is consistent.....in producing big screen rubbish.<br/><br/>Regarding the story, it borrows heavily from Logan's Run. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812/<br/><br/>A society underground thinking the outside world is uninhabitable, two young lovers escaping to discover the truth and then ""freeing"" the others who then walk out into the sunshine, bleary eyed and amazed!"

He suggested that seeing as I had liked Armageddon (I hadn't, I far preferred Deep Impact - similar themed film that was released at the same time), I'd love this.<br/><br/>It started so promisingly. The world is contaminated. They're the only survivors. And you get out by winning a lottery to the island, the only non contaminated bit left outside. Except you don't, you're a clone, created to generate bits for someone who is rich and needs them and your number is up when they need or want their transplant.<br/><br/>It's not meant to be intellectual and indeed doesn't attempt to be such. It's a no brainer action film, unashamedly so. McGregor leads the show, in style, Johannson is getting better and better in every film she does, by giving a good show with a pretty poor dialogue allocation, whilst Sean Bean is a good bad guy and Buscemi turns in yet another good geek-that's-critical-to-the-plot performance. Michael Clarke Duncan is criminally underused. The actors and actresses are fine. The plot is thin-ish, but fine. The context is definitely fine, original even.<br/><br/>And then it gets ruined (and I do mean RUINED) by the amount of product placement that is ridiculously blatant. It got to the point where both me and my mate where counting the amount that we saw.<br/><br/>So here goes: We counted McGregor wears Puma Shoes, Aquafina is served at numerous intervals, McGregor's other half drives a tasty looking Cadillac, McGregor and Johannson hitch a lift at one point on a very shiny Mack Truck, X-Box floated in there at one point, there's a big Johnny Rockets logo (you can't miss it), MSN is used to look up Johannson's other half, they use Amtrak to get to LA, Johannson uses AMEX to pay for some ice cream, McGregor's other half uses a Nokia phone to make a video call, plus I've seen Jeremy Clarkson on that nice shiny boat that features a lot as well.<br/><br/>It's blatant, and ruins what is otherwise a good 1.5 hr yarn."
"maddas69","3","2","4","21 August 2005"," Oh, no
","I was really looking forward to this film, as it has cost a small fortune to make, has a good cast and a decent director. I avoided all reviews prior to watching the film, as those usually spoil the experience of the film for me. I went to a great cinema, alone, left the missus at home, and sat down for the experience. Two hours later I left the theater utterly disappointed. So be it that the plot is very thin. I knew it probably would be, as this was an action flick, and that was what I was looking for. I must say that the car chase was very good, with some nice demolition of several cars, but that was about it. All I seem to remember from this film is RUNNING. Running, running and running. There is actually nothing happening! And the fight scenes are awful. I cannot understand why directors these days makes the images fly so fast over the screen that you really can't see what is going on. Is it a way to shorten down the recording of the film? You don't need to teach actors to simulate fighting anymore, as it doesn't matter. Just move the pictures as fast as you can across the screen so nobody really can see what is going on. I just hate that. Give me Kill Bill any day, now that is fight scenes for you. The acting in this movie is pretty good, but you wouldn't expect anything else from Mcgregor and Johansson. The plot is very thin; about 10 minutes into the film I knew exactly what was going to happen next and how the movie would end. There is no strange twists and turns, no surprises at all, and it is actually not thrilling at all. Except for putting a lot of efforts into scenery and action-scenes (except the fight-scenes) this movie has absolutely nothing, and was very boring. Stay away, or buy it cheap at Ebay when it is released on DVD, it is not worth a trip to the theater."
"Ptroinks","4","2","4","17 August 2005"," Michael Bay does ""it"" again!
","I didn't know much about this movie before I saw it (I only saw a short teaser once), not even the cast, but I did know that it was a science fiction movie, and being a sci-fi fan, I really looked forward to it. As I sat in my seat at the local cinema, the smile on my mouth was soon turned into a frown when I noticed the text ""A Michael Bay film"" (or something like that) in the opening credits. That was a big ""uh-oh"" for me because it seems he has a bad habit of trading story for action. Sure, I enjoy a good action movie, but not when the story goes out the window because the director thinks good pyrotechnics and digital effects can satisfy moviegoers just as well as a good story can. I'm not going to spoil anything at all here, so all I'm going to say to those who are considering seeing this film is: This script had the potential for greatness, but a lot of disappointing scenes in ""The Island"" makes me give it a 4 out of 10. Yes, this is a sci-fi movie, and I guess a lot of what I consider to be mistakes can be excused just because of that. But I think a really good sci-fi movie manages to ""teach"" the audience the movie's definition of reality, and that allows us to get more caught-up in the story. ""The Island"" has quite a couple of scenes in it (I won't spoil anything, relax!) where I just shook my head in disbelief. It was just as if watching these scenes abruptly pulled me away from the tension in them and got me stuck in a ""reality mode"". And for a sci-fi fan, the ""reality mode"" is not very much fun... <br/><br/>For those of you who are thinking ""OK, I'm not going to see this film"", not seeing it is probably just as good if you get as disappointed as me when you see a good script getting wasted. But I think a part of me still wants to recommend this film, because despite all its drawbacks, it's still a kind of story you don't see every day, and at times, it can be surprising and really exciting! <br/><br/>What you've just read is just my personal opinion (if anyone was wondering). There are as many movie tastes around as there are people, so for all I know, I might be the only one who got a kind of bad feeling walking out of the cinema as the end credits rolled by."

","I wish that I could have turned off my brain and just enjoyed The Island as a straight-ahead action film. However the film seems to beg to be taken seriously. The premise is potentially interesting: evil doctor runs a city of clones used as replacement parts for rich people. Of course the clones are oblivious to this. Two young and attractive clones discover they are all being duped and escape to semi-futuristic Los Angeles. The film seems to take the moral high ground on such issues as man playing God and the right to life. Unfortunately, things go downhill from there.<br/><br/>The remainder of the film consists of some decent chase scenes and otherwise great actors trying to save a very confusing script. Djimon Hounsou, Sean Bean, and Ewan McGregor (in two roles) all try to salvage a troubled movie. Scarlett Johansson had the hardest task trying to breathe life into the adolescent fantasy character of the naive, loyal, sex object. The film's creators are likely hoping that the audience has not seen or doesn't remember such films as Logan's Run, THX 1138, or Coma because The Island liberally borrows from the better films. Don't worry about my including a spoiler because the two people with whom I saw the movie and I disagreed about what actually happened the last in the final 20 minutes.

What begins as a fascinating sci-fi film ends up an action movie, which essentially ruins it.<br/><br/>While great chunks of The Island are fantastic, and McGregor and Johansson act it well, Bay was the wrong choice as director.<br/><br/>And what THE HELL was with all the product placement?

The movie itself tries to be something it's not: believable.<br/><br/>I liked the overall idea of the Island and what they were trying to say about the morality in growing clones, but why challenge our intellect with such a complex idea, only to turn around and insult our intelligence by doing insanely stupid things to these characters? Like, why would the driver of the MACK truck not realize his load was falling off and keep on....well...truckin', and how could Lincoln and Jordan have practically every gun in America shooting at them, only to fall off a building and come out....running? (And I invite anyone who decides to see this movie to keep a tally on the number of times ""Run!"" is yelled in this one...it'll rival South Park's use of the ""F"" word I'm sure)<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me the most? How could Lincoln and Jordan be off running in the DESERT for at least what, ten or fifteen hours, only to end up sitting on Steve Buscemi's couch with a drink in their hands...and NOT take a sip? They are CLONES not MACHINES!

It went from a brilliant believable futuristic story to a ridiculous car chase beat all odds while dodging hundreds of bullets that happen to miss by an inch every time movie that just wouldn't end, just like this sentence.

"Tony43","Null","2","4","26 July 2005"," Cloned again
","This film takes cloning to a new level. Rather than just being a duplicate of one other clone movie, it borrows its cinematic body parts from a variety of unwilling donors, from ""Coma,"" from ""Logan's Run,"" from Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,"" from ""Blade Runner,"" and apparently from some low budget clone flick that I never even heard of.<br/><br/>But does it make good use of these purloined pieces of plot? The answer is both yes and no. Overall, the story works and Michael Bay turns out a mildly entertaining movie that might satisfy younger viewers who crave a new cinema rush every week, and people like me who will pretty much see anything of a sci-fi nature, but also, pretty much anything Scarlott Johansson appears in.<br/><br/>The big trouble is, this film is such a wasted opportunity and one big reason is that it was made, not as a thinking person's film, but just one more big summer blockbuster that requires that lots of stuff gets blown up. Particularly distressing is the big chase through downtown Los Angeles midway through the film. Forget the incredible lapses of logic in which people eager to keep this cloning scandal a secret do things that would be bound to start major investigations, like blowing up buildings, killing cops, etc. The big question is, why such excess, why all the overkill? One of this film's real strengths is the impressive set design of this slightly futuristic Los Angeles, borrowed heavily as it is from the 1920s vision immortalized in ""Metropolis."" Rather than have the evildoers chase our hero and heroine though this interesting landscape in some suspenseful manner, they instead just resort to car crashes, helicopter crashes, and lots of other tired antics found in every other action movie.<br/><br/>But I guess this is what 14 year old boys crave, and so this is what they get from Hollywood.<br/><br/>My last complaint is simple. Stars Ewan McGregor and Scarlott Johanssen seem to have zero chemistry together and their mandatory mating towards the end of the film seems tacked on, as if somebody suddenly remembered they needed a love scene and they'd better throw one in. The interesting thing is, these two cloned humans are supposed to be educated to the age of 15 year olds, an age when most kids are chomping at the bits for their first romantic experiences. So something could have been made of their sexual awakening. Instead, we get the one obligatory love scene that has about as much passion as a dental exam.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked this movie, but don't like the fact that in targeting Hollywood's standard teenage audience, the filmmakers have missed every opportunity to make a good film."
"mhoney-1","8","2","4","25 July 2005"," Stylized fun/frightening morality play
","What would you do to survive? How much would you be willing to pay for a longer life? These are the issues at hand in Michael Bay's latest film, easily one of his better efforts (and helped by the absence of blockbuster king Jerry Bruckheimer, if only a little). The world Bay has created looks real. The action doesn't always. But he's brought an excellent cast on board to help the movie on its way.<br/><br/>Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) has lived underground for three years. He's something of a rebel in a nearly perfect society, one of two remaining sanctuaries from the contamination that has killed almost everything outside. That other sanctuary is the Island, a ""Garden of Eden"" that everyone hopes to go to, by winning the lottery. Lincoln's best friend is Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johanssen), who is a more obedient member of their society, who likes to show Lincoln up in a virtual fighting game powered by XBOX (the advertising is everywhere). Only Lincoln asks questions, like where does the food go that he and his friend Jones Three-Echo make every day? The only clues he can find come from a white-trash maintenance guy, McCord (Steve Buscemi), who works in the outer, more contaminated area of the society. Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) worries about Lincoln's queries.<br/><br/>When Jordan wins the lottery to go to the Island, Lincoln has another of his bad dreams, only slightly different from before. He gets up in the middle of the night and slips into a restricted area, disguised as a doctor, where he makes a very disturbing discovery. Two of the citizens at Merrick were sent to the island. One, a lottery winner named Starkweather (Michael Clarke Duncan, a happy version of John Coffey), and Lima, a pregnant woman whose water just broke. Lima has been euthanized while her baby was delivered to another woman who looks just like her, and Starkweather is seen running down the hall with a surgical cut down the center of his chest.<br/><br/>Of course, as anyone who knows anything about this movie would know, Lincoln tells Jordan and they make an escape, pursued by a French mercenary (Djimon Hounsou, delectably amoral) and his cold-blooded cohorts. Merrick explains to Hounsou's Albert Laurent the importance of getting Jordan, since model Sarah Jordan is comatose in a New York hospital. The two find Lincoln's old buddy McCord at a biker bar, where they learn they've got a lot to learn about the outside world. Says Lincoln: ""I've gotta go get McCord. He's in a can taking a dump,"" having absolutely no idea what that actually means. McCord sets them straight on who they really are, that they are actually clones of millionaires, and tries to get them on a train to L.A., where Lincoln's ""sponsor"" lives.<br/><br/>L.A., 2019 looks remarkably realistic. It's a believable future because the cars look almost the same, yet elevated trains keep going up and up and up, mercenaries fly around on hoverbikes, and cars have a finger-print identification system. Laurent and his cronies are following the ""stolen"" credit card McCord, now dead, gave to Lincoln. A series of shoot-outs occur between Laurent's guys and police, Laurent's guys and civilians, and especially, Laurent's guys and the two clones. The best scene during this is when our two heroes are riding on the back of a tractor trailer hauling train wheels, and untie them, sending them rolling along and into their pursuers' vehicles. Another scene, that was too hard to believe, was when the clones are hanging on the insignia of an office building, and fall ninety stories to still survive. ""Jesus must REALLY love you,"" says a construction worker and witness to them, upon their miraculous survival.<br/><br/>More fun and excitement follows with the face-to-face confrontation of Lincoln Six-Echo with Tom Lincoln, a Scottish boat designer who is much more fun to watch, even if he's not the good guy the clone is.<br/><br/>McGregor, as both insurance and sponsor, is quite good. His American accent is actually better than the trailer would have me believe, and his sense of wonder is quite believable, as long as Bay remembers it, so too does his egocentric persona as the Scottish bad boy. (Since Lincoln's false memories are actually the memories of his sponsor, he is all the more believable) Johanssen, as the educated-to-fifteen-years Jordan expresses a sense of curiosity at the verge of maturity maintains a borderline childlike point of view at all times (except in bed, something ""Newsweek"" critic David Anson brought up with Bay in an interview). Sean Bean is marvelous as yet another of his many villains, this one being a scientist with a God-complex who never quite grasps the absolute amorality of his work. Hounsou is brutal and intimidating, and a last-minute change of heart is exactly the kind of thing that, for some reason, never seems to work in movies - he's too bad to be good. Buscemi once again helps to round out the movie as a human foil, full of humor and a cynical look at things. Linclon: ""What's God?"" McCord: ""Well, you know when you wish for something? God's the one that ignores you."""
"Gnosys","8","2","4","24 July 2005"," Very good movie
","Whoa! This movie made my Sunday evening, and weekend as a whole. I mean, it's not a magnum opus, maybe a little creepy when you come to think of the concept - but the characterization and acting by the leads was just brilliant! Everything was so well crafted that you will exit from the movie theater with a smile. Unless you're weirder than weird, of course.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, so many questions arose - Why a Scotsman (McGregor) is made to speak with an American accent? Why is he paired with a lady (Johannsen) 10 years younger to him. Guess what - even these silliest of answers get answered in the end! <br/><br/>PROLOGUE: This is not a SPOILER. It's an explanation of how things are before the time-line of the movie begins. <br/><br/>The setting is 2019. People have gotten richer, of course technology has advanced drastically, and the concept of cloning does exist. Noted celebrities, politicians, sports-persons desire to live a longer life and a career no matter what has to be done. Thus, there are clones created in a remote institute in Arizona run by an English scientist ,Merrick. Merrick and his staff basically take a complete scan of the client (called the ""investor"") and a clone of the same investor is created with the same physical and anatomical, yet closer to perfect, features. However, these clones, or ""insurance policies"" as they are called, are bred to only be killed eventually for their spare parts - lungs, heart, you name it, to be taken away and given to the investor to live longer. Until their termination time, they are fed on a very strict diet, and are only educated up to the level of a 15 year old. <br/><br/>The clones are kept content in their inner lives by being told they were brought to the institute because they were ""contaminated"" in the real world and were getting cured from the same. They were also promised a lottery where a winner gets to go to the ""Island"" - where a new world is set to begin, new breeding, no pollution, etc. <br/><br/>This is until a flaw occurs in the habilitation process and one product, Lincoln has questions....<br/><br/>----------------------------- <br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen were absolutely brilliant in their acting and carried the movie from beginning to the end. I was slightly disappointed when I saw the trailer earlier, and it implied that Scarlett was becoming a blonde bimbo of Hollywood - but I was wrong. She not only had a role to play, but played it well. Hope she becomes the next Hollywood superstar as she is a truly good actress, and charming in her own way.<br/><br/>McGregor, on the other hand, carries his post-Star_Wars grace very well, and should be looking for some really dramatic and challenging roles in the near future to get an Oscar or some awards. He is a good actor, and is definitely no James Bond material - too down to earth as an actor (maybe not as a person) to play the cocky British spy. <br/><br/>The supporting cast - Michael Clarke Duncan only had a few lines to spare and was a cry baby, but an OK role done. Djimon Honsou - Hollywood's only ""African"" actor played his role well and gracefully. <br/><br/>Steve Buscemi is what one could call a struggling actor. I respect him for trying something new like playing a confused ex-con on a full season of the SOPRANOS - showed his less-comedy side which he portrays in Adam Sandler movies. In the Island, he did sort of fit the role of a crazy techie, but he needs to find something that will bring his recognition back up.<br/><br/>Sean Bean, the smooth talking, English villain who played a James Bond baddie too early in his career, also carried his vicious role well. Would have been more appropriate to see an American Southerner play the role of the institute's head-honcho as it was set in Arizona. <br/><br/>Overall I gave the movie 8/10. I prefer it to Minority Report, and thank God it was not too hyped!"

Again here he did it all well he is the next Stanley kubrick as well as being a spawn of Stanley Kubrick this film he made reminds of of Kubrick and Michael bay made another awesome masterpiece great job to Michael bay for doing it Stanley Kubrick himself would be proud. Overall and anyhow the biggest thing I can say about this movie is that it's another fantastic sci fi drama directed by Michael bay and it is among being one of the best films of 2005"

","Spoiler alert: in order to give an accurate review of this movie, there will be spoilers. The film starts off with a great idea. It is mysterious and keeps the viewer glued to the screen, wanting to know more. People living in a futuristic environment seem content and completely at peace with each other and their environment. They're all keen on winning the 'lotto' to go to a picturesque island. They are happy to be safe, considering the world has been destroyed and the outside world is a no-go zone. Or so they thought.<br/><br/>It is then revealed the lotto winners are actually harvested for their organs, and the island was simply an excuse for explaining why they never return. Fair enough. Still very interesting so far. Then comes another twist: these people are clones. They are the brainchild of a brilliant doctor who came up with the idea of making clones, so humans can have organs - identical to their own - at their disposal. Like an insurance policy. Still, a very good premise.<br/><br/>Then, however, these clones want a life of their own, and escape. Now, these clones are considered the protagonists, and the brilliant doctors and scientists suddenly become antagonists, as does the humans who invest in their own clones. Ok, now it becomes preposterous. All of a sudden the clones are the heroes and we're supposed to root for them. Why?? They are what they're intended to be, and they're not humans in the true sense of the word!!<br/><br/>The action sequences are incredible, and the film is fast-paced. But that's about as much as I enjoyed here. So, in the end, it's supposed to be a happy ending when the clones break free from their 'captive' environment. Ok, so now what? What are they supposed to do? What is to become of them? And this is the happy ending?? Oh, boy...<br/><br/>Would I watch it again? No."

","It's a movie with a great premise which has a couple of good actors and a very interesting set of events. It has good characters, likeable and credible, which make the time spent with this movie a real joy. It also has an interesting future world, well described through CGI, full of mysteries to be discovered by the protagonists. It manages to maintain suspense throughout its entire length thanks to its general lack of predictability, apart from the last part, keeping you guessing most of the time. It's not linear and it definitely knows how to create and maintain a mysterious but also thrilling atmosphere.<br/><br/>On the downside, the first part has a pretty slow pace, drifting slowly towards boredom, but picks up pace pretty quickly when the intense action sequences come into scene. Unfortunately, those seem much too exaggerated in order to be believable or even enjoyable. I can understand that exaggerations are necessary for such a film, but too much is simply too much, and this one apparently doesn't know when to stop. Another disappointing aspect about this one is the finale, which no matter how you look at is, is very predictable and honestly, not very satisfying.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a movie which impresses through its plot, world and especially premise. Together with a couple of good characters, it is able generate an entertaining and suspenseful watch which deserves your time. Too bad that its downsides drag it down a bit more than I had hoped, keeping it away from being the great movie that it had potential to be."

","See Michael, you can make a film without robots. I am not a big fan of Michael Bay (except for his very first robot film). But I glad to say, like the robots that evolved in this film, Michael Bay has evolved into a better director. He was already a master of action sequences, and special effects, and now he has added mastery of magnificent sets and depth to his characters; features missing from his previous efforts. I give him credit for improving his directorial skills. Most directors never improve; they just keep going back to the same formula some successful film that might have made money for them in the past. The story is a combination of Hunger Games and Logan's Run (an interesting hybrid), plus the current development of realistic robots. Although these humans are really just fresh body parts for the rich, they are just young children emotionally. They are not really robots. The story has a tragic element, too. It is the deception of innocence that the viewer finds the most monstrous about this type of film. There is seldom a more heinous scientific component to a film than the deception of thousands of innocent people. A job well done, Michael."

"~AleXa~","9","0","0","5 September 2015"," Intense, stylistic action ride with a weighty, emotional undercurrent
","Reviewed September 5th, 2015 - 4th viewing (Blu-ray 2D-1st)<br/><br/>Rich and brilliantly shot, you are immediately captivated by the dystopian premise and artistic set pieces. Questions of science, progress, and ethics enthrall the viewer from the start, and the chemistry between the leads, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) is immediately apparent. You embark on a ride with the two of them, equally enamored with the world they live in and the science behind the fiction. I love films that not only allow us to question the established societal norms, but to convey the importance of thinking for ourselves, never allowing ourselves to trust merely for the sake of it. Even authority figures or educated professionals can be wrong, and we must always look to our own intuition and trust our instincts to drive our own lives.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is amazing as well, adding both gravity and levity driving the plot along. My fascination with the potential for automation and medical advances was coupled with the weight of seeing how some of our own basic human rights were deprived, serving to establish a firm attachment to our characters. Scarlett does a superb job transitioning from naïve and helpless to driven and self-reliant, propelled by her trust and faith in her best friend Lincoln, who she comes to realize through the journey they inevitably find themselves on means so much more. I also enjoyed the foresight regarding the fight simulation sequence as to lend more credibility to her character's rapid development. I can't help but think her performance in this film drove Marvel to see her potential as the iconic Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff—I could not be more impressed with her growth.<br/><br/>Normally I cringe at the prospect of the same actor playing two different people, but Ewan's performances were so well done you never gave it a second thought. Between the accent and his affection and protective instincts for Jordan, he sold that scene—truly impressive. The locations lent a certain gravitas and believability to the stark differences between their simulated world and the real one. I thoroughly enjoyed the snake scene, as they would of course be like children in regard to danger with animals and scenarios they've never been exposed to—another feat accomplished by their stellar acting.<br/><br/>The film poses a number of provocative questions about humanity and ethics, and whether or not something created from your own DNA could be classified as property. This is an interesting topic as currently, the law views pets (living creatures) as property, and as such, for example in the event of an untimely death, the owner is only entitled for the purchase price of their beloved pet. At any rate, I find the entire premise an interesting lesson in ethics as we are currently standing on the precipice of progress in that this ""science fiction"" could be on the verge of reality as we speak. As far as the argument that this would never be allowed to come to pass given government regulation, these people do not understand that money drives the world, and for the salary these people are given and the fact that they work in an old military bunker deep underground, there is little motivation or opportunity to speak out if they want to live.<br/><br/>While some of the action sequences are improbable, they are so spectacularly done, it is hard to care. Sure, the truck driver would've pulled over after the first metal dumbbell fell onto an oncoming car, and the highly trained mercenaries probably wouldn't have shot the sign down, but in reality, people do dumb things, so I'm not sure how much weight that argument carries. And I personally found the mercenary Albert's change of heart as he came to know the truth behind the job was another superb representation of choosing humanity above all else, which was in essence the theme of the film. The decision was completely in character based on what his family suffered, and I did not find this predictable in the least.<br/><br/>Other than the intense action scenes, you could hardly tell this was a Michael Bay film—it was so rich and stylized and genuine. Sure, it still contained his trademark explosions and pizazz, but it held a powerful message locked inside a beating heart, and I truly was left feeling satisfied in a way I cannot quite explain. It fires on all cylinders, providing something for all caches, both realized and unrealized: the intelligent thinker, the brooding romantic, the skeptical believer, and the adrenaline junkie. It is his best work by far, and I can only hope this will not be the last of its kind. I'm not sure why others choose to fault Bay for his directorial style and wide-sweeping low angle shots when they serve to convey the emotion behind the sequence. The man is great at what he does, so give credit where credit is due. By the end of the film, I felt as though I had lived through the events with them, and that is nothing short of a marvelous accomplishment in my book. My only real complaint would be product placement, but few action movies are devoid of it, so it hardly seems a noteworthy point.<br/><br/>I was so incredibly stupefied and sated, I was ready to watch it again the very next day, seeking out the thrill ride and emotional weight that left me feeling so elated by the end. That very rarely happens to me with the volume of films I watch and am amazed I have not given it more viewings to date. I cannot recommend this film enough! <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A mind-blowing thrill ride sitting atop a large-scale, stylistic set piece supported by some of the very best acting talent with an intelligence and emotional depth that few films achieve, this movie WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.<br/><br/>9.0 of 10.0"

","so you hear the title ""The Island"" (2005) and what do you think of, Blue lagoon? Pirates ? Sandy beaches? try, ""none of the Above"" Spoiler Alerts ahead. The title is misleading. I know it was done on purpose, but I did not watch this in the theater because of my misconceptions about the titles implications. The movie was Directed by Michael Bay, and hosts seven writers. That in itself should tell you something. Michael Bay has a unique approach to movie making, when things get slow, blow something up. Michael of course hopes things never get dull. Here he takes a decent concept, and over kills it, with pointless chase scenes, unbelievable escapes, and noisy explosions.<br/><br/>Lincoln six, and Sarah Jordan, played by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are living a life of confusion. The first act of the movie introduces us to their strange world. Everyone dresses the same, emotions are forbidden, life is dull, and the only way out is to win a lottery that takes you to an Island of pleasure. Both leads are aware that their lives are being manipulated. This is the movies best part. A unusual discovery leads Lincoln to realize that there is a way out of his world. He takes his lady friend along. The movie reminded me of Logans Run, somewhat updated. When we learn the secret of Lincon and Sarah's existence, the movie takes a change in plotting. The two fugitives are hunted down, in a world of noisy EFX, and CGI battles. buckle your seat belt, because the movie never slows down.<br/><br/>The main issue that the movie brings to light, is the use of clones for replacement body parts. Humans are grown from choice genetic material, for the sole purpose of organ transplants, if that should become necessary. Here the clones are presented as childlike adults, with shared false memories. Again I may be making this sound better than it is. There is some good acting here, and interesting camera shots. The movie runs out of steam in the last act, and really has difficulty trying to find an ending. What we are left with, seems like an afterthought. rather pointless. Seven out of Ten ""keep em moving"" Stars. Show less"
"Lucabrasisleeps","5","0","0","28 February 2015"," Good concept but over the top execution
","I am a little ashamed to say that this is the first Michael Bay movie I have seen. I know that is strange. This movie is not a bad choice to start.<br/><br/>I actually liked the concept. Mostly it reminded me of earlier movies such as Blade runner, Logan's run and others. It has been done countless times but it was still a nice ride. But my problem was that a good concept has been ruined a bit by some ridiculous action sequences. It starts slowly enough with Ewan mcgregor becoming curious about the facility and investigating what is going on. But then suddenly the action starts and it just seems to go on and on. At one point, when I saw the building sign come off and hit the helicopter, I started getting a headache. It is just mind boggling how these two characters can survive with the police and the search party on their heels. And these guys were carrying high caliber weapons and shooting non stop. I understand this is a common complaint in action movies but these guys were no Stallone or Schwarzenegger to pull it off.<br/><br/>One plus point is that I discovered how creepy Ewan Mcgregor looks. He could do some roles like this too. I admit I haven't really seen many movies of his, so maybe I am not aware of his other roles. Scarlett Johansson looks gorgeous. For some reason, her eyes look more alive in this than some other recent movies of hers.<br/><br/>The filmmakers could have taken more time for character development rather than get into the action so fast. A concept like this needs more time. I also thought Sean Bean as the villain was a little cartoonish and plays the same mad scientist role which has become a tired cinema trope now. The change of heart of the agent is also done in an abrupt way which is not highly logical.<br/><br/>I did think it was entertaining though. The two main characters are sympathetic enough for people to root for and the ending is also a nice touch. It could be much better though.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Part of this movie is a cool science-fiction story about a huge, elaborate, high-tech clone colony in the future run by a corporation that harvests these clones for their body parts. The clones believe they are the remnants of the human race, and that they will eventually be relocated to the last habitable spot on earth: a paradise called the ""the island"". This is a rigidly controlled world where the clones are kept happy and dumb. The corporation has a huge secret: no one knows that these clones, by medical necessity, have had to be allowed to develop sentience. This part of the movie was pretty good.<br/><br/>Two of the clones escape, and the director of this project must stop them at all costs from revealing the secret. This part of the movie (almost half?) didn't appeal to me so much because it consisted of chase scenes and shoot-outs, the two staples of every Hollywood movie. Yes, it was fast-paced and competently done, but it was still very tedious to watch.<br/><br/>To buy this part of the movie, you have to believe that the staff at this facility are all fanatics capable of keeping a secret, and that the security guards will do absolutely everything and anything to fulfil their orders, much more than even highly trained soldiers would do: relentlessly pursue their prey, drive recklessly, shoot wildly through populated cities, kill innocent people, destroy buildings, ruin expensive vehicles, and even die for their orders. I'm sorry but at one point I realized it was no longer about the plot and believability, but just about cars and guns and selling seats. Yuck. I try to avoid movies like this and I can only drop my score because of it. I have to drop it a full point for this.<br/><br/>The movie felt noble and principled, but what was the point really. Save the clones? Don't f*ck with mother nature? Treat everyone with dignity? Liberty for all? This aspect is not clear really. I can't stand behind it.<br/><br/>Having said this, I must say it was all entertaining and well done. It's an intelligent, well written movie, but with a good dose of action.

Like Logan's Run, on which it is based, it's a little heavy on the heroics of the hero and heroine -- yes we get it, these guys' resourcefulness exceed expectation, and more importantly, they mean well -- but the twists in the plot keep you interested for most of the 100+ minutes you must watch to get to the explosion-filled arch-villain's just desserts.

Being that Mr. Bay just made a perfect copy of ""Parts: ..."" with better funding, he falls into a category I call Same Movie- More Money (or, S. M. M. M.). I wouldn't have a problem with this if credit was given where credit is due. After I knew there was a problem I guess a few more people figured it out and eventually the director of ""Parts: ..."" sued Michael bay and won siting something like 146 similarities. Bully for him!"

","I am a little perplexed why this film got panned and did so poorly at the box office. Interestingly, it earned a lot more overseas, so perhaps Europeans (mostly) have a different view of things? This story is not really new: in the near future, scientist (Merrick, well played by Sean Bean) figures out a way for rich people to grow clones for spare parts, who are given artificial memories and kept on an island until needed. One (Lincoln Six Echo/Ewan McGregor) becomes aware he and the others are not survivors of some global ecological catastrophe who are being saved to reproduce humanity; through a flaw in the programme that instills memories, he seems to acquire the memories of his biological matrix, a rich and dissolute motorcycle designer (also McGregor, of course) who needs a clone for an eventual liver transplant. Lincoln escapes with his friend Jordan Two Delta/Scarlett Johansson, who doesn't do so much in the movie, but looks great and does what she does best, which is to suggest a latent sexual power. The action is carried by a credible McGregor and his nemesis, a relentless mercenary Albert Laurent/Djimon Hounsou hired to bring back or kill the escaped clones. This movie has some of the best action scenes around, because they are entirely credible: Johansson and McGregor seem as lucky as they are proficient at running away from Hounsou, which keeps things believable. The science behind it also comes out as needed: we don't get the one colossal lecture about how things work (like in the older James Bond movies when Goldfinger or Dr. No reveals his plan for global domination). Sparse science is good in science fiction. The writers thankfully do not include details meant to convince us the science is real, as when a character tells the audience when cloning was invented, by whom, when, etc. Here, it is just taken for granted that trains will fly in the sky; technical achievements are balanced by a social dystopia: rich and poor live in different worlds; human life is obviously cheap (the mercenaries just shoot up anything that gets in their way), etc. Also, the movie has a lot of relatively funny but low-key parts: when McGregor's human friend Steve Buscemi chooses costumes for Johansson to wear instead of the island-issued jump suit, for example, or when McGregor-Evil Designer matrix realises his clone is running around with Johansson but is still a virgin (that sounds wrong, no insult intended to Ms Johansson; I should have said ""running around with Johansson's character""). So, what's wrong with this movie? Well, the inevitable preachy ending, where McGregor/Lincoln returns to the island with Jordon/Johansson and frees the slaves, I mean, clones (Lincoln, get it?) after a showdown with evil genius Merrick, and when the mercenary reveals he ""understands"" oppression and changes sides. Okay, it had to end somehow, but the operatic choral ensemble as they walk off the island in their Rudi Gernreich Space 1999 jumpsuits (remember Barbara Bain?) reminds me of those 1990s British Airways commercials set to The Flower Duet by Delibes. Overall, it's as if they shot sequentially and had already spent most of their special effects budget for the earlier chase scenes. All in all, a gripping film. I especially liked that it avoided excessive preaching about clones and harvesting human beings. It lets its images (the mercenaries' indifference to human life) and its actors (such as a very convincing Bean as an evil idealist who thinks the clone technology will save more lives than it claims – not new, but Bean can pull this kind of fluff off in his sleep) communicate its message, such as it is. I think perhaps Americans expect huge casts and crews in this kind of film, but here it comes down to a dozen actors in chase scenes; strangely, it's a ""talky"" but low-key intellectual film despite the high grade action, so maybe this explains why Europeans seemed to like it more. Worth watching: fast paced, well acted, economic script."

","The Island begins with what appears to be an Orwellian future where people rescued from a global disaster live a strictly regulated and controlled life inside a safe facility. A lottery awards winners with the freedom to go and live on an island, said to be the only safe place in the ravaged world. However, as the protagonists find out, this is all a huge deception.<br/><br/>I love the first half of this film. The intrigue and mystery of the controlled setting and the sinister doctor overseeing it were paced very well and the way the characters discovered the truth behind their situation was very well done. Added to this are some genuinely poignant moments that really make you think, such as the Lima One Alpha scene.<br/><br/>I like the second half of the film somewhat less. After the characters escape, the mood of the film shifts to being more of a frenetic action film with flying vehicles and stuff exploding and people killing each other.

"morlock9","8","0","0","15 February 2010"," Great film, but did Bay just get lucky?
","I was all set to give this movie nine stars and a gushing review, but then I watched the DVD version with the director's commentary and have to rethink my initial impression. Bay made a telling and devastating remark regarding the final scene, where Jordan and Lincoln are seen on the Italian boat from an aerial shot. Bay almost apologized for putting it in, calling it ""cheesy."" Wow. Cheesy? The balloon deflates! That could have been even more of a brilliant scene that it was. Bay missed an opportunity to craft a Bergman-esquire ending, linking the strong and haunting opening sequence with the final scene, and bringing home the dream versus reality aspect to the film. This is very revealing. It tells me that Bay is far more of a corporate-driven technical director than an artist. He can complete a complex movie on time and within a budget (sometimes). Even Bay is proud that he shoots more scenes per day by far than the average director. Were the great parts of the movie created by the assistants and the writers? (One ""great"" part was actually created by Ridley Scott in ""Blade Runner."" You'll know when you see it.) Perhaps the DreamWorks recognized Bay's failing and makes sure that he is surrounded by brilliant people. Spielberg viewed the dailies while this film was being made, and gave many suggestions to Bay. I think the great parts to this film are due to Spielberg's uncredited influence. Other aspects of the movie I was willing to overlook now become more suspect. The Hounsou transition from bad guy to good guy was clumsily handled. The bond that developed between him and Jordan bordered on the ridiculous. Bay admits that having Hounsou wandering outside the destroyed complex with the rest of the ""products"" and smiling back at Jordan was something he threw in on impulse at the last minute. It shows. This also explains the product placement- Dreamworks wanted it for extra revenue. Were the clones called ""product"" as an inside joke referring to this? Still, a good if not great movie. The music was tremendous and incredibly moving when synced with the helicopter pan shots. Ewan and Scarlett were utterly believable as the clones. The Merrick set was spectacular. The action scenes were first-rate, of course, which is what Bay is known for. Unavoidably, the lighting was dark in order to accommodate the CGI. That's to be expected these days. So instead of concluding that ""The Island"" was a flawed but brilliant movie, after hearing the director's commentary I have to conclude that Bay just got lucky in having talented underlings and advisers, and taking their advice."

","Since humanity developed self-consciousness and sense for it's surroundings as part of this universe, it was just a matter of time when someone smart enough (or stupid, depends on point-of-view) would put an equality sign between things (objects) and living creatures. This premise vibes through many modern Sci-Fi/Drama movies in recent years, and 'The Island' is no exception at all.<br/><br/>Industrialisation, capitalism, mass-production, and, particularly for this title, advancement in bio-technology, all added to a general idea that EVERYTHING can be bought or sold. Even human life or part of human's organs. This is the same message we get every day from media like television, internet, or even movies (Hollywood at least). Commercials (Puma, Bentley, MSN Search to name a few relevant in this case) are everywhere. Sell, sell, sell (rings a bell?).<br/><br/>This title plays a tough game with human freedom and choice, greed and arrogance when modern science and technology gives us more power then our spirit and mind can handle properly at first. Our not-to-distant future relatives need to prepare themselves for this kind of moral and ethical decisions and I wouldn't like to be in their skin then...<br/><br/>What I didn't like in this movie was a fact that it had a bit irregular tempo - action was a bit rushed at the end and without proper timing and order as it seems.

","Underneath the explosions and slo-mo camera, underneath the obligatory mugging of the lead couple, underneath the rather cheesy pop culture references, is a movie that has (perhaps accidentally) found something incredibly profound to say about society and the way we live. It got behind my eyes and made me wonder, which is not something you would expect from a Michael Bay movie.<br/><br/>So you all know the plot by now; in the near future, clones are grown in underground facilities as spare parts for their owners, and fed a story about the rest of the world being contaminated. The one thing that keeps them going is the dream of winning the lottery, where the prize is going off to live on The Island - a paradise, the only uncontaminated place left on Earth.<br/><br/>What is this saying about life for the average blue collar Joe? We are, essentially, spare parts for the ruling class. When we break, or become problematic, we get thrown away. The point of our very lives is to be ground up into the machine that services the super-rich. Everybody dreams of becoming rich themselves - winning the lottery of life - and getting to escape forever.<br/><br/>Or you can take the path of the hero, which involves getting smart and finding out the truth of this artificial prison - and the impossibility of winning life's lottery, perma-rigged by the owners.<br/><br/>Four years it has been since I saw this movie, and I still have trouble coming to terms with how true that message is. Will I ever 'win the Lottery' and get to escape from the death chosen for me at birth? The movie also manages to score a few surprisingly not-dumbed-down points about issues like stem cell research and the rights of the unborn. At one point, a character says ""I want to live. And I don't care how."" If living for another fifty years meant killing another man by shooting him yourself, few could bring themselves to do it. But what if the other man only existed because you created him, and he technically owes you his life as well? The film then throws us another curve ball by revealing that one clone's creator is in a coma, and unless the clone dies, the owner will too. Abortion for medical reasons, anybody? Does anyone under any circumstances have the right to decide if another lives or dies, especially if the the other has no voice? The movie then goes on to evolve the life-or-death scenario above with increasingly selfish reasons for killing your clone. Being able to live for another fifty years yourself is one that most people could eventually justify to themselves ... especially if the decision could be made on your deathbed. Using a clone to birth your baby because you are infertile yourself is an interesting one - could you warrant creating one new life by sacrificing another? But what about if you are a football player who needs new legs to save your career? Or a model who needs new younger-looking skin? At what point in the above scenarios do you draw the line? I give the movie additional points for ending with dual nods to the audience. Of course, the clones eventually find out the truth about their world and escape to freedom. But the fact that this scheme was allowed to go ahead in the first place, and that the movie deliberately sets itself very much in the real world, seems to suggest that if such a technology were to become available today ... then yes, people would do it. And they wouldn't care how."

Their portrayals actually make you care about the clones' plight, and Mcgreggor does a great job playing two versions of Lincoln. Steve Buscemi also does a good job with his usual ""dirty-minded man with a heart of gold"" role.<br/><br/>The special effects were excellent (It's Michael Bay), and the film rarely drags.<br/><br/>WEAKNESSES <br/><br/>There are several OBVIOUS ad placements which distracted from the story. Scarlett Johansen is often seen screaming ""Lincoln!"" and adding little to the film. And there is a sex scene which comes out of nowhere and makes you go... WTF?<br/><br/>However, there is much more good with this film than bad, and it deserves some attention. It makes you question the quality of human life and makes you feel for the characters in a desperate situation.<br/><br/>Overall... I consider this to be Bay's best film. It's dark, yet somehow fun.

","The Island might not be most original or authentic sci-fi production so far. Orci and Kurzmann ( I saw them as very bad scriptwriters ) ripped a lot from Clonus Horror. Besides as usual in every Bay movie there is over extensive use of car chases , gun fire and explosions and he filled rest of the movie with them again but first time ever this didn't disturb me much in a Bay movie. Unlike horrible Pearl Harbour or awful Tranmsformers ( worst big budget film I have ever seen in my life after Independece Day ) The Island does not deny what it is : An entertaining summer popcorn flick. Hyper fast chases , fights or explosions are accepted as part of this package deal and here Dreamworks Productions seem to limit Bay's over extensive use of special effects to some degree. A few interesting questions about cloning , its ethics and where it might lead if it was commercialized were aroused but these themes are not followed as far as it could be. There is also lots of commercial brand advertisement but it also gives the audience a more real feeling of close future.<br/><br/>The quality of production especially camera-work and sets of futuristic clone production/containment facility is beautiful. The contrast of newly born and naive clones white garment to black uniforms of clone facility staff are well contrasted. A few moments of look at daily life to clone facility actually gives the feeling of militaristic/medical society ( that scene is at the beginning of the movie ) <br/><br/>As for acting : It is not bad I suppose. Ewan McGregor is doing his best. His innocent behavior before ""rebirth"" of his character and sponsor of his character were well written and displayed. Scarlett Johannson is very easy to look into but he takes a backseat next to McGregor I think. Steve Buscemi is wise comic relief , Djiman Houmatsu is professional mercenary who is tasked to hunt Ewan and Scarlett. And British actor Sean Bean is the villain as the doctor in the charge of clone facility which suits him well.<br/><br/>To summarize The Island gave me the feeling of grand 80'ies or 90'ies sci-fi movies feeling (like Total Recall or Robocop ) even just for a moment. My suggestion give it a try if you like decent sci-fi and video clip like fast action"

This movie connects to the issue of human cloning because this movie seems like what would happen if human cloning would go array and unmonitored.

After stumbling upon something sinister, Lincoln escapes with fellow inmate Jordan Two Delta, and now the consequences for both of them are as dangerous as it is for the rulers of this strange and intriguing place.<br/><br/>If you are entering a movie that is directed by Michael Bay then one can reasonably assume you know what you are going to get, cue explosions, ear splitting sound mix and a host of carnage set pieces. Bay's formula works and mostly his efforts have entertained the popcorn masses. So it's interesting to find that ""The Island"" does have some intellectual nous in amongst the Bayhem that the director is famed for. Working from a tantalising cloning story written by Caspian Tredwell-Owen (though the similarities to Robert Fiveson's ""The Clonus Horror"" resulted in a law suit being filed), ""The Island"" now more than ever is highly engrossing sci-fi in premise, where certainly the ethics of the story's core are worth scrutinising.<br/><br/>One of course can argue that Bay was the wrong director for such interesting material, and yes it's a point to note that the characters and plot arcs are not given any depth or a serious second glance, but really we are here for the bang to go with the buck are we not?. Ewan McGregor (Lincoln) and Scarlett Johansson (Jordan) play it just about right, the bemusement of their situation is coupled with daring do heroics, while suitably tongue in cheek performances come from Sean Bean, Djimon Hounsou and a picture stealing Steve Buscemi. This is not a film that is easy to recommend because it can frustrate as much as it entertains, but entertain it does, and with big screen TVs and glorious home cinema a staple requirement for the movie fanatic, ""The Island"" is something of an essential purchase - check out the highly octane outrageousness of the road pursuit here, it's fabulous through the speakers.<br/><br/>A serious topic is given a nonsense sheen for sure, but hell what a blast it is. 7/10"

I didn't know what exactly to expect, but I was really surprised when I realized how may ethical issues this movie arose. It made me ask myself a couple of truly interesting questions. It also reminded me that some people actually enjoy playing God as one of the characters of the movie does. We should always know exactly what our choices imply and be responsible about it. As for the film itself, I found it exciting to watch, mostly surprising (I hate predictable movies:))) and, as another IMDb user mentioned, I liked the fact that physical violence and sex scenes were limited, which made it easy to watch with all the family. The acting was great and the pace was right. Watch it:)!"

","Before watching the island i did not no what to expect. I had not really seen it advertised at cinemas, so i was going into it a bit blind. However after watching this film, i can safely say this is one of the finest action movies i have ever seen. It would be a bit harsh on the film to just call it an action movie, as it has a far fetched yet believably storyline that works and is compelling to boot. The action scenes are phenomenal, and although it starts off a little slower, then second half of the film is all action.<br/><br/>Credit must go to the actors in this film also. Ewan McGregor plays his lead role really well and i think his acting is improving with age, and Scarlett johannson surprised me as supporting role.<br/><br/>However my favourite performance in the film has to go to Sean bean, i am a huge fan of him and he can play villains so well (as seen in goldeneye), and he plays his in the island as a mad doctor with no feeling for anyone or anything, and u end up hating him by the end of the film<br/><br/>Credit should also go to Michael bay, his films always turn out to be enjoyable, but not necessarily with an in depth story, however the island integrates both.

","Good movie! Good story, even though there may have been a few gaps in the story... Very different story that was thought out in such a way that it seems like it may really happen some day. Sort of along the lines of The Matrix. Only, it mixes in some flavors previously explored by other movies (like Godsend), but others have only scratched the surface, where The Island, goes all the way! I liked that this movie portrayed the ""evil side"" of humans in that we want what we want, just as long as we don't have to face where it comes from. As quoted from the movie: ""Just because people want to eat the burger doesn't mean they want to meet the cow."" -McCord {Steve Buscemi} AND ""All I know is, people will do anything to survive. I want to live and I don't care how."" -Licoln Six-Echo {Ewan McGregor} Good acting. Ewan McGregor is maybe not one of may favorite actors, but I think he did a really good job in this movie, and the scenes where he had to play two parts were totally convincing and there was no hint that it was actually one person playing both roles. Scarlett Johansson did a good job with her role and brought a feminine and quite sexy appeal to the story. I don't really think she's sexy (just my personal opinion as dark hair is more my taste), but there were moments in the movie that made me go: ""Ooooooooo..."" I also think that she mixed well with Ewan to combine a really good co-sharing lead role relationship. I liked the futuristic elements of the movie. The way traffic will work with monorails running on the sides of buildings and flying motorbikes. Works well. It missed something, though... Like that feeling of ""magic."""

","I am really not a fan of Michael Bay's work, but I have to admit that The Island was not that bad of a movie. Sure, it had plenty of action, but you could expect that from a director like Michael Bay. There were explosions everywhere, but a little more subtle than normal. The movie centered around people winning a trip or being chosen to go away to a place called The Island. I was already thinking in my mind that it had to be to good to be true. All items that are ""free"" or ""too good to be true"" had so type of consequence later on down the road. The starring characters found it out too.

","The Island is Set in the not too distant future, it takes us to a time when humanity is on the edge of extinction after an event called The Contamination killed off most, if not all life on the planet. The movie focuses on two survivors of The Contamination named Lincoln Six Echo played by Ewan McGregor and Jordan Two Delta played by Scarlett Johansson who live in a facility that houses survivors of The Contamination until they win the 'lottery' and are taken to the last patch of uncontaminated land on Earth 'The Island'.<br/><br/>The movie has some great action shots with high speed chases, blazing guns and people miraculously surviving 30 story drops without a scratch. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people who like realistic story lines and people blowing up stuff for no necessary reason. But if you like a good action film, this is one for you. Director Michael Bay (who is well known for his big action packed films such as The Rock, Pearl Harbour and Armageddon) really put an effort into the action scenes in this film.<br/><br/>I really don't think that Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson were the best pick as the leads in an action/science-fiction movie, but they did do good for what they were given to work off. We are more use to seeing Scarlett in Romance / drama films with great story lines and no action. And with a history like that I give her thumbs up for the effort. But Ewan is more used to these types of film. For example Star Wars, Stormbreaker and Black Hawk Down so I was quite disappointed with his effort in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall it was entertaining but just another wild-adventure action movie that's okay but nothing super.

","Ewan McGregor is a terribly good actor. Not just because of the range and depth of his characters but because he has a sound professional mind that seeks out compelling, totally different projects. For some reason, he is the only blockbuster actor who seems to be allowed to do this. At first glance, The Island is the same as any other Michael Bay film (that is to say, the same as any summer Hollywood blockbuster). The script is by no means unpredictable (possibly because entire pages are borrowed from much loved classics and sleeper hits alike) and the action by no means a small portion, nor un-violent.<br/><br/>But let's face it, we see Bay's name and expect this. And going in with this expectation you are pleasantly surprised. Yes the storyline is so chunky there could be adverts between set pieces, but this is perfect for pausing to get another beer! Yes Scarlett looks good and says nothing worth hearing, but why else did we buy this DVD? And yes, the action is so manic and ludicrous we are left gormless-ly appreciating big explosions without considering they may have caused innocent deaths of minor characters but hey, it's just a film and, damn, those explosions are big.<br/><br/>Its fun, and yes at the end maybe a part of your brain is considering the work of a very naughty Merrick (captain fabulous Sean Bean) and how we would rather a maniac like that never get a chance to allow life to imitate art. But mostly we are remembering the explosions and motorbikes.<br/><br/>Once you've looked past Scarlett's tight tops and cringed at the frankly HILARIOUS product placement we see some beautiful scenery and very nice production design.<br/><br/>And the actors. Well yes, most phone it in and the characters are very stock but look at the list: Bean, McGregor, Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou. These people are at most peoples best when their work is its worst. You can't help but watch them and be entertained.<br/><br/>You can all watch it, no matter what age or relation. Just sit back, watch, laugh, (cry perhaps?) and think. Though not too much.<br/><br/>If films were a delightful English Buffet, with Schindler's List a beautifully elegant cream scone at one end and the GodFather films a selection of teas at the other, The Island would still be a super-massive explosive inferno sending shards of the Bone China scattering into the faces of the guests. Enjoy!"

Eventually, two of the clones find out about the harvesting, etc. etc.<br/><br/>Am I the only one who thinks it's painfully obvious that ""The Island"" is based on this movie?

","A surprisingly smart thriller from Michael Bay, best known as creator of goofy CG-laden action movies like Armageddon and Pearl Harbour. The setting, story and style borrow liberally from classic sci-fi movies like Blade Runner, THX 1138 and Logan's Run, but its focus on the ethics of cloning and using people custom-made as organ donors is very timely, reflecting the current debate about stem cell research and designer babies.<br/><br/>This being a Michael Bay movie though, it also includes more than its fair share of wild chases and fight scenes, including one of the most impressive freeway chases I've ever seen, and some flinch-inducing shoot-outs in a crowded city with huge chunks of debris raining down all around. A surprising amount of this action was done for real using practical effects and stuntmen instead of falling back on CG, and the results are all the more impressive for it.<br/><br/>The action does threaten to overwhelm the story at times, particularly during the escape from the facility that houses the clones, where for several minutes seemingly every line of dialogue consists of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson shouting 'run!' at each other. But overall it's a good balance of story and spectacle.<br/><br/>Despite the potentially rather grim subject matter and simple black and white morality (quite literally - the people running and guarding the facility all wear black uniforms, while the clones all wear white jumpsuits), the film also avoids being overly preachy and even manages to throw in a bit of humour, mostly thanks to a fun cameo by the always reliable Steve Buscemi as a sleazy maintenance worker in the facility who befriends Ewan's character.<br/><br/>Given Michael Bay's track record I was a little sceptical about this film going into it, but it turned out to be a real winner."

","When i saw 'The Island' it kinda reminded me of the book a brave new world. Its about the creation of a perfect world (an utopia). The people in the perfect world have never known something else then what they live in and usually don't question it. I think its a very good movie with a great story. I like especially the idea, that they gave the clones the hope to go to the island. If u give people hopes and dreams they wil keep going to fulfill those dreams. They could make a sequel that shows what happens when all those clones get in the real world. I could guess allot of strange looking faces u would have. Only thing i thought was strange when Lincon Six Echo and Jordan were sitting on the letter on the high building and they fell down, because they were being shot at, how could they survive such a long fall?"
"findingleeza","6","0","0","1 November 2006"," Original idea or imitation?
","If you watch ""The Island"", without any information before start the movie, you'll be surprised about the story. The whole idea of a contamination and 'a clone for everyone with money' is a bit bizarre.<br/><br/>This movie is located in the future, and it starts in a sort of underground Utopia with a lot of people in silly white costumes. I have to admit that it looks very futuristic, and there are a lot of nice special effects in the movie. My opinion is that they have exaggerated the action scenes, but maybe I just don't like action films very much. The movie would be better with a bit more story in it, in stead of action. The actors did a really good job, nothing to blame them. They look very innocent and they bring the movie on a higher level with their acting performance. <br/><br/>Personally I think that the director of this movie valued the form more than the content. Undoubtedly the makers spent a lot of time with all the futuristic effects and gadgets. What I like in the movie, is that when you start watching it you don't know that all the people in the building, even the head characters. But the good beginning is not progressed in the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the story itself isn't a very new one. I think the basic idea is very similar to the book ""Brave New World"", written by Huxley. There are a lot of comparisons with that book.<br/><br/>First of all, it's the setting. The head building of the movie is located in a sort of tremendous factory. But if I read the descriptions of the centre in ""Brave New World"", I get a picture in my head that is quite equal to this building. Thereafter is the mean character of ""The Island"" almost based on one of the characters in the book: Bernard Marx. He failed in the new world because of his inferior mental level. And I think Lincoln Six Echo is like Bernard Marx. He is smarter than the rest, he is constantly asking a lot of things that he's not allowed to, and he is doubting if the contamination is true. At third, there is the sleep-teaching, called hypnopaedia. In the book the 'children' (they are not born, but made like a product in a factory) get moral lessons in their sleep. In the movie the clones (are not born either!) are taught in their sleep too, they have to collect some general memories. And all the clones get moral lessons during the day, like ""a healthy person is a happy person"". The idea of dividing the clones into different groups (their work for example) isn't very original either. In ""Brave New World"" the citizens are also divided into a couple of groups: the alphas, betas, gammas, deltas and epsilons. And after work, the clones in ""The Island"" even go to a sort of recreation room, like 'the feelies' in the book. <br/><br/>So what I wanted to say with this review, is that the movie looks like a good idea and a well-done futuristic creation on the one hand, but on the other hand it's more a sort of stolen idea of an old book."
"ruudbosch","7","0","0","1 November 2006"," Mixed feelings about this high potential movie.
","When I was finished watching 'The Island' I got left with mixed feelings. I think the story and main ideas have a lot of potential. The idea of clones that are isolated and unaware of the 'real world' is, in my opinion, extremely fascinating. Unfortunately the movie can't manage to fulfill these expectations and swiftly shifts into just another action blockbuster.<br/><br/>The movie starts of rather mysterious and it is immediately made clear that it takes place in the future. You'll see lots of high tech equipment and the entire environment is white (white is often associated with the future as it has a very professional and modern feeling to it). One thing that I think is so good about this movie is that from the second you press the 'play' button on your remote you'll be sucked into this movie.<br/><br/>In the beginning this movie relies heavily on its plot. It's about a company that clones a person, if he or she is willing to pay dearly for this. From then on whenever this person needs an organ donor or other body transplant these 'parts' will be taken from the clone product (said to be a brainless body, but in fact these clones are sophisticated human beings). The existence of this company depends on the world not knowing that these clones are able to think and have emotions. In my opinion this is a brilliant plot, and that's why I was all the more disappointed with the main progression of the story.<br/><br/>About halfway the movie the setting changes from the cloning facility to the 'real world'. And though it is still a very nice action movie it doesn't meet the high standards it sets in the beginning. I also found the end to be highly unsatisfying. What I really wanted to see is how the world reacted to the existence of the cloning facility, but in the movie only Lincoln Six Echo's sponsor is confronted with the fact his 'product' is a living and breathing human being. And even then this is hardly worked out in a decent way. Tim Lincoln is hardly surprised seeing his clone in real life, nor does he find it shocking that his 'product' can talk.<br/><br/>In the movie the director does make a good point about eduction though. The way the Agnates (official name of the cloning products) are raised is really interesting and immediately made me think of the novel 'Brave New World'. In both this book and the film humans are brought up with sleep teaching and taught to behave according to an environmental pattern. The director also tries to make a point on the subject of environmental influences on education. Tom Licoln and his clone are both exact the same person, but their characters are completely different. Lincoln Six Echo feels responsible for other people, and tries everything in his power to save his fellow 'victims' (Merrick to Lincoln Six Echo at the end of the movie: ""You could've taken over his life, but you chose to come back here instead, you are unique, Six-Echo.""). In a contrast to this there is Tom Lincoln who doesn't seem to care about anybody but himself.<br/><br/>All in all I found 'The Island' to be a highly entertaining movie, that has not reached up to it's potential. The bar it sets in the beginning isn't nearly met later on as the story progresses. I'd recommend this movie to anyone that just wants a normal Hollywood blockbuster, because that's what it is. Just don't expect to much of the story."

","Let's start off with stating that this is good, entertaining film if you like an action movie. Although the film commences quite gentle, you'll soon be finding yourself riding rough, action packed, terrain.<br/><br/>But action isn't all that this movie has to offer. The story is set in the nearby future and brings up an interesting matter; the ethics of cloning, which is becoming a very hot topic in our own current society. Especially in the first part we learn more about the controlled society of the clones, which are referred to as ''agnates''. The way they are 'grown' and brought up shows quite a few similarities with the people in the book Brave New World (i.e. indoctrinating/learning in one's sleep)although in The Island cloning doesn't affect the whole society, like in Brave New World.<br/><br/>The story revolves around two characters, i.e. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), although Scarlett Johansson doesn't have that many lines. Also the fact that we don't get to meet Jordan Two Delta's 'sponsor' (the cloned person) made me think more of Scarlett as 'the sidekick'. The 'sponsor' of Lincoln Six Echo, who we do get to meet, isn't like the 'agnate' at all, which I find not that plausible. On top of that, the encounter between one another, or shall we say, the showdown, is a bit corny (''I am Tom Lincoln! - No I am!'').<br/><br/>Another issue where the movie lacks in plausibility, is the merge of technology in the nearby future and the basic skills of the agnates. An example; we see a train system which allows trains to float above the ground (so no wheels), where the most spectacular scene in the movie involves train wheels?! The agnates also seem to be super intelligent where they figure out the mechanism of a gun and how to fool another human being in just a few minutes whereas, in the controlled society they are not taught to be violent or deceitful. The part about violence isn't exactly true; it is said in the movie that they don't know violence but they are allowed to play a sort of fighting game (another flaw in the movie?) played on a next generation X-box. <br/><br/>This brings me to my final point of criticism; product placement. Some don't find it annoying, well... I do.<br/><br/>Althoug you may find this review a bit negative, I find it a great film, which leaves only a few question marks behind for the critical viewer. It's simply a good movie with some ethics and scepticism on cloning, a lot of action, and a (although a bit quiet) beautiful female protagonist. I highly recommend it and therefore I awarded The Island with an 8."
"marjoleinketels","8","0","0","31 October 2006"," ""The Island"" at some points compared to ""Brave New World""
","The film ""The Island"" is all about clones, who do not know they are clones. The people they are clones from, think the clones live like plants. They do not feel, nor can they think. The opposite is true. The clones are like normal human beings, except the fact that they know less. For example they have never seen a car and they do not know anything about sex. The clones think the world has been contaminated and that they are all survivors. Their reward is a lottery, in which clones are chosen to go to The Island: the only place left in the world that has not been contaminated. But in fact, there is no island and the clones are, after they have won the lottery, used for donating organs to their 'originals' in the real world. After that, they are killed The clones Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta realize at some point in the film, that there is something not right. They escape from the clone-world and have to deal with several problems in the real world.<br/><br/>The film ""The Island"" has some similarities with the book ""Brave New World"" by Aldous Huxley. In both works are people copied and the clones are taught in their sleep. This is called hypnopaedia. There are a few versions of the memory implants the clones are getting in the film, but they are all more or less the same. For example, everyone was living at a farm before the 'contamination' and everyone had a nice bike. As well in ""Brave New World"" as in ""The Island"" people are not supposed to have feelings. The difference is that in ""The Island"" the clones do have feelings, where the 'original' ones think they do not. Another similarity is that in both works regularity in the behavior of the clones is very important. When there is no regularity and order, the 'products' will be too developed and they will be curious about certain things, for example about the question why they keep finding new survivors. Human curiosity is unwanted in the clone-world, because it can lead to difficult questions and disobedience of the clones. This would be very dangerous because Merrick, the leader of the clone project, can not possibly let it happen that there is some outbreak of clones into the real world and that normal people, suddenly see their 'insurance policy' standing right in front of them. The last thing I want to say about the similarities, is that in both works it all is about a person who is different from the others. That one person starts to think and with that he gets a lot of trouble<br/><br/>Finally I want to say that I think ""The Island"" is a good film, although sometimes the story is a little predictable. For example at the end when the real person and his clone are fighting: you just immediately know that the 'police' are not going to be able to make a difference in who is who. Last but not least: imagine what would happen if this film represented the truth. Imagine that you would have your own insurance policy, walking around somewhere hidden below the ground and fully able to think and to feel.."

But, copied or not, it don't matter because what matters the most is how they delivered it to us audiences. And, fortunately, this flick did one hell of a job. Great visuals, the sound is well-timed and man, the car chase scenes is off the hook. Especially, when Lincoln and Jordan rides the ubercool Jetbike of some sort all over the city. One scene that was obviously given the most effort is the car chase scene between a truck that carries railroad wheels with Lincoln and Jordan in it and Laurent's mercenaries. And when Lincoln starts dropping all those tonfuls of railroad wheels, my oh my, PURE DESTRUCTION DERBY I tell you. Cars defies gravity and goes flying everywhere. Especially the armored truck that did a perfect flip when a thousand tonne railroad wheel hit the bumper. God. Breath-taking. This is definitely one of Michael Bay's best films of all time. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson gives off yet another good performance. You can't go wrong with Ewan's Scottish accent, its pretty catchy. And to all the others, Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi, Djimon Hounsou and Michael Clarke Duncan are great too.<br/><br/>I should've given this film a perfect 10 but they killed off Steve Buscemi so that's a -2. LOL."

","After the ghastliness of ""Pearl Harbour - It Was The Japs What Done It"" and ""Bad Boys II - Electric Boogaloo"", Michael Bay gets his mojo back with ""The Island"".<br/><br/>The plot borrows a lot from other science fiction films but it is chock-full of kinetic energy. The sheer enthusiasm of the cast and director are what carry this film past all the genre clichés and make it - dare I say? - fun to watch. Michael Bay makes his stars look fabulous and he pitches them into the action with all the recklessness of a glory-hunting general. Reducing the tragedy of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour to the level of a popcorn action movie didn't work at all, but Bay's enthusiastic pop-video approach is perfect for ""The Island"".<br/><br/>He is not let down by his cast. Sean Bean simmers perfectly as the villain, Steve Buscemi reliably laconic as the Comedy Fallguy, Scarlett Johansson is effortlessly sexy as the Token Girly and Ewan MacGregor powers through the whole mad farrago at Charm Factor 9.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is perfect popcorn fare, with very little thinking time between all the action and sheer spectacle. Don't analyse this movie or compare it to more ""Worthy"" science fiction because that's not what it's there for. ""The Island"" is made to entertain you, not broaden your horizons.<br/><br/>Strap yourself in and enjoy the ride..."
"ionelx","6","0","0","15 October 2006"," Decent Sci-Fi Pic
","'The Island' is a decent sci-fi pic that I would place in the same genre as ""AI"", ""I, Robot"" and ""Gattica"". In fact, it's not really so much either of these (generally better) movies as it is a patchwork of themes that are common to them (and for that matter, most anti-utopian novels concerning the not-too-distant future). 'The Island' deals with one of the most controversial topics of our modern era- genetic engineering- and revisits some of the same old eugenicist fears that were depicted in 'Gattica'. Like both 'AI' and 'I, Robot', it also treads old ground as far as how society deals with an increasingly close yet disturbing fusion of technology and society, and its implications for the ways we view ourselves as human beings.<br/><br/>I felt that 'The Island' tended to drag on at certain points, and it certainly could have been cut down to size, from it's theatrical length of 2 1/2 hours to 2 or even 1 1/2 hours. I would have preferred to see a richer development of the main characters, especially since the entire theme revolved around the struggles of the two protagonists against a corrupt institution. I would have preferred to understand more about how that society came about in the first place, and why its existence was so well hidden.<br/><br/>The action sequences especially tended to divert attention away from some of the serious themes of the movie, appearing more like Spielberg summer schtick than Kubrick sci-fi (which is one reason why I felt that had Mr. Kubrick had a chance to finish ""AI"" we might have truly seen his final great classic as it was meant to be). But I digress here..<br/><br/>""The Island"" is worth checking out."

A few minor plot holes are forgivable but a bit annoying. The acting is above average.

","The Island is a movie that takes a somewhat familiar plot approach -- lots of story, closely followed by lots of action. It is a very interesting topic, however, and one whose naïveté is portrayed in a mixed bag of emotions, with serious as well as comedic scenes.<br/><br/>I tend to pick out things to criticize while watching movies, so I do have my comments about the scientific possibilities presented. Things such as unbelievable memory growth, hovering super-strong motorbikes that can defy physics, or nanobots that can fit under your eyelids and exit through your penile tract! There are many more moments like these where you will find yourself laughing.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I am granting the movie a pretty high score, because the plot is in many ways horrific; I'd say a rough mix of Equilibrium, some ideas from The Matrix, and a few aspects of Hostel. Truly a movie of extremes, The Island proves to be quite an entertaining thriller."

","Okay...here's the thing...<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes or so in ""The Island"" were great. They were well-made, fantastic, and just wonderful. If the first 45 minutes were one movie, i would watch it over and over again.<br/><br/>The Island is about two people living in a facility-like-place. They live among many people in there, and are told that the reason they are there is because the rest of the world is dead from a virus, and that they are the only survivors and being in the facility is the only way to survive. However, every day, one person is chosen by a lottery to go to ""The Island"", which is the last outside-place the humans can go, and they are told that this island is of heavenly perfection.<br/><br/>The two leads are Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, who i will refer to as Ewan and Scarlett for the rest of the review.<br/><br/>Anyway, Ewan then finds out the horrible truth: that he is actually a clone in this facility living among many other clones. Not only that, but there is no island. The person who is chosen to go to the island is actually the clone they need to harvest organs from to save the original. So, if the original needs a new kidney, they tell the clone that he or she is going to the island, take the clone through a hallway, knock him/her out, and take out the kidney, and then kill the clone. <br/><br/>Ewan and Scarlett escape, and this is the very point the movie went downhill from here. I don't know if it was whether these new sets were not as pretty as the facility, or if I was in a bad mood, but it was probably because Acts 2 and 3 weren't as good as the amazing first Act. Acts 2 and 3 felt rushed. Too rushed. The action was bad. This was one of those rare movies where the action was actually boring to me. I wasn't excited at all. It was too rushed. The action didn't look nice either, except for the car chase, which was good. It didn't thrill me, but it looked good.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, if the whole movie was made as well as the first act, it could have been an amazing movie. However, I just didn't like acts 2 and 3...they weren't as well-directed, exciting, or good as the first act. <br/><br/>The movie should also have been shorter. If it were no more than 1 hour 50 minutes, it would have been much smoother and better paced...so, say the movie stays the same but some more scenes were cut...the movie would have been good. If the last two acts were better-made, the movie would have been good. If the last two acts were better-made, and if it was only 1 hour 50 minutes, the movie would have been amazing. <br/><br/>The action should have been better. The whole movie should have been as good as act 1. The only part I liked at least a little in either acts two or three was the car chase, and even that wasn't that great. <br/><br/>I just didn't care for anything that happened. Nothing in acts 2 or 3 was fun or amazing, like act 1.<br/><br/>Act 1 gets a 10 Act 2 and 3 gets a 2 The average is 6<br/><br/>so, therefore...<br/><br/>I give this one a 6 out of 10."

However, the source book, The Experiment by John Darnton, was much better - or shall I say different. Not many people know that the movie was based on this book, except those who read it.<br/><br/>The typical Hollywood mix has been added to the movie to give it an adventure value, where is the book is more of a psychological thriller.

","I don't know why the industry keeps letting Bay make movies filled with car chases, loud noises, and explosions. Those things are not required to make an entertaining film. A good script is what is important. And this movie does have a good setup. We are introduced to people who are told that the whole earth was contaminated and they are the survivors. They are sequestered and have ""guards"" but are allowed to work, exercise, party. The one thing they have to look forward to is winning the lottery and going to the island. It doesn't take long to figure out something sinister is going on. Two ""clones"" learn the truth and escape only to be relatively lost in the real world. They search for their counterpart and eventually decide to save everyone like them.<br/><br/>I thought the story made sense. But it was filled with ridiculous car and motorcycle chases. Plenty of loud noises and explosions. All which don't add to the film. They just make it more unoriginal. There is even the silly love scene between Lincoln and Jordan. What did Jordan watch some porn while waiting for Lincoln and that's how they knew what to do? <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. I thought it was entertaining even if silly in parts."

","The Island is a film about the not so distant future when a corporate minded entrepreneur finds a way to keep you alive longer than you should be. This was a great idea, and the film started out pretty well.<br/><br/>I really liked the first 45 minutes or so of this film. It had you curious, showed excitement...the story seemed to be going somewhere. So where did it loose it for me? When the two escaped from the situation they were in. It stopped being interesting and started becoming patchy. I had a lot of questions about how ""quickly"" the two escapees adapted.<br/><br/>Then there were the excessive action scenes that Michael Bay, the director, is famous for but seemed misplaced in several areas. This could have been quite the cool sci-fi film more than going for the big budget blow up film. All of the elements were there. It just seemed to go overboard once the two subjects left the facility.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johanson and Ewan McGreggor are the two subjects of this film and they were cast fine. Actually, I had no problem with ANY of the casting, everyone fit. Sean Bean was wonderful as well. The problem was with how the story unfolded, where the action was and when and a few plot holes that could have been easily taken care of.<br/><br/>Is this film awful? No. Is it bad? Not ... really. It's just one of those films that has so much potential and didn't grow where it should have grown -- and that is in the sci-fi realm.<br/><br/>What a great concept this film has. Loved the first 45 minutes of production designing. It could have been along the lines of sci-fi society films like THX 1138 or 2001 in which you were presented a future society that the human race wished to expand and the means of which human and in some cases technology played a part. The Island poses another theory that is very plausible as well.<br/><br/>Maybe they didn't want to make a ""thinking man's"" film and wanted to go for a ""popcorn"" film instead. A ""thinking man's"" film elements are there...but so was the ""popcorn"" - and that's too bad."

Ewan Mecgreger, Sean Bean, Michael Clark Duncan, and Djimon Hounso are all just as horrible. Steve Buscemi gives the only decent performance, it was a horrible moment for the film when he died. The plot is fairly complex and good for the first half of the film, and then it goes all blow em up on us and the only real dialogue is ""Run"" or other things that mean about the same thing. Both parts of the film are good, just uneven. All in all a decent thriller/action film, very entertaining with little substance, and including some of the best fight sequences ever put on film."

There was no mystery to it beyond what we saw in the previews and when it's all said and done, all we're left with is a slick looking action flick, as expected from Michael Bay - with chase scene after chase scene, explosion after explosion and while fun to some, it's been done before and it's been overdone by Michael Bay.<br/><br/>I expected better.

Surprisingly, popcorn blockbuster director Michael Bay is at the helm of what seems like a film with an involving story. And for Bay it is, his best storyline since ""The Rock."" However, by reasons that are beyond me, and you for that matter, unless you were responsible for this film's marketing campaign, the trailer ruins everything. That's right. Everything. Any of the pretty interesting story turns are inanely ruined in the trailer.

The difference between this film and 2003s dreadfully bad ""Bad Boys II"" is that this film isn't as profanely vulgar and the characters actually have believable motives. The action scenes are also top-notch, most notably the ""train wheel mayhem"" scene, however, by the end, Bay starts to push the action to insanely destructive limits and also drags the story into a typical cheesy ending a la ""Pearl Harbor.""

","Michael Bay is the wunderkind protégé of super producer Jerry Bruckheimer. His credits include films that amount to their pitch, dressed up in bombastic scores, pretty actors, explosions, melodrama, epileptic editing and enjoyable but undeniable silliness. For him to do a ""thinking film"" (on paper) begs two questions: ""why?"" and ""how?"".<br/><br/>Why? Because Mr Bay is entitled to explore other things (or at least to want to). How? By a mix of sometimes obvious, sometimes original ideas. The story focuses on Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson), clones living in a secluded environment until they discover things are seriously wrong. The escape (I doubt anyone can consider this as a spoiler) and many chases occur, with an underlying theme of ethics and what it means to be human.<br/><br/>The subject matter of cloning is addressed with its plethora of moral dilemmas, even though the condition of clones is never as degrading as it should be (if the clones' environment is Bay's version of hell, he must live a very protected life). It is also shrugged of pretty quickly to focus on a love story between pretty people (admittedly very pretty in this case). The choice of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson for a blockbuster is welcome as they are each thoroughly enjoyable and watchable actors (and Bay enjoys making them look even better without crushing their acting). One part of McGregor's performance (a scene with his alter-ego) even evokes subtlety (I know this is a Michael Bay film but you read correctly). The action scenes are predictably quite good if occasionally grotesque (believing in our heroes' survival from a certain building fall demands serious suspension of disbelief) and one car chase is particularly grizzly.<br/><br/>The problem is blatantly exposed in one DVD extra where Michael Bay says that he told the screenwriters to not dwell on the action scenes. He'd fill it in. Well it often feels that the whole film received this treatment. There is a lot of glossy Michael Bay and little serious thought on what are very contemporary issues. so the film disappoints for promising more than it is. It remains entertaining nonetheless for giving us its' two leads ruining from bullets and motorcycles, and for several nice little elements, such as Djimon Hounsou, a nice main theme in the music (typical of Michael Bay, let us admit) and that car chase...<br/><br/>This good fun, but certainly not a ""thinking"" film or message film. The only message to be found is this: let Michael Bay be Michael Bay."

It's better to see action scenes than to actually care about the plot.<br/><br/>The way Michael Bay reveals that the community is fake is interesting. We see one question being answered after another until we reach the big finale. The ending is satisfying but it's not great. This is a long movie but you won't care because this is such a good movie, you won't even care about the plot holes in this movie. I don't care about anything but just wanting the characters to reach their main goal. This is another great McGregor film, including his Star War films.<br/><br/>Just watch this film if you want to see a mindless action film and you'll be fine. Come to this movie with a brain and you won't like it as much. Get ready for a full throttle thriller!"

","When i first saw this movie i didn't wanna see it. Me and my friend were gonna sneak in to see ""Wedding Crashers"" so we bought a ticket to ""TheIsland"" and we couldn't get in because of security so we went in ""TheIsland."" And when it started i loved it a lot! I don't know why! Then everything was suspenseful and terrific. I'm good at predicting movies but this one i couldn't! This is good and I recommend you seeing it,but its a lot better on surround sound! The characters were good and funny at points. When the black guy (no offense) died, I cried. It was a solid performance and makes you feel very sorry for him and the other clones. I wish the special features were better and cooler but then again it didn't make a lot of money. Everything was good and it never got boring. I can still watch it till this day. This is ""Michael Bay At His Best!!"""

","Overall a very watchable film. I liked the deeper levels of identity that this film also touched upon. At what point does a 'manufactured' copy become so close to the original that the two are undifferentiatable...? At what point does someone cease to be what they were and become what they are as a whole human being? These issues include much that is of wider importance - take transsexualism and how society deals with this, are all part of this debate as well.<br/><br/>Fundamental to all of this is human dignity and the respect we need to afford all life irrespective of our own definition or sense of 'Humanity'. I hope the film gives you food for thought!"

But overall the movie keeps you interested in what happens next as the movie unfolds. There is a but of b.s. shoveled your way though for example: Caution: Spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>1. The cars: Sure, you see SOME futuristic cars in this movie (one, maybe two). But for the most part the cars circulating through L.A. traffic in the year 2019 are the cars that are circulation through traffic NOW. Such as the Chrystler 300C, the dodge magnum, the Chevy SSR, HUMMER H2...I even saw a Honda Element in this movie. Some of these cars were driven by supposed ""Elite ex Delta Force and SEAL operatives.... Sure, there are a few cars from the early 90's still running around today, but folks those cars are ANYTHING but mint condition. The cars previously mentioned in this movie look brand NEW!!! By that time they are 15 year old cars!!!!!!!! 2. If you look at some of the other technology in this movie believe me, I don't think it's stuff we can accomplish in the next 13 years. They are inconsistent with the overall technology and then the cars.<br/><br/>But overall, the movie is action pact and OK to watch....once."
"philiptutton","6","0","0","2 March 2006"," passes the time, but seriously flawed
","'The Island' could have been great, but it turned out to be simply good; not even very good.<br/><br/>The film starts off very, very well, in what appears to be a '1984'-type totalitarian state, but once Lincoln Six Echo discovers the truth, or even from the moment he starts to suspect that something is afoot, the film just goes from bad to worse. The action is far too OTT, and completely unrealistic. If you're after good car chase sequences then watch either of the 'Bourne' films, or better still, 'Ronin.' The island provided plenty of thrills, but only the type that satisfy the most shallow of action film junkies. I personally love action films, (such as 'Die Hard' or 'Aliens.' They're both action classics and i adore them) but they have to have some substance as well as eye-popping visuals in order to be a good film overall.<br/><br/>There are other parts of the film that appealed; when Lincoln and Jordan are in the 'real' Tom Lincoln's house, and the bit in the biker bar, just after they've broken out. Suddenly the character based dialogue is back, and Ewan, (both of them!) and Scarlett show that they can act. It's a shame the film doesn't contain more scenes like this, as the two leads are very good. As it turns out, Michael Bay suffocates nearly all of their talent, reducing the film to a ridiculous special FX bonanza, which is mildly boring and unrealistic.<br/><br/>This film isn't all bad. It's really gutting to have a movie that started off so well, and then had nearly all the potential sucked out of it by a complete moron of a director. As well as the more intimate scenes between Scarlett and Ewan, the music is really good, and Sean Bean puts in his usual top-draw performance; if Sean was in it more he might have made this a 4* star film. Alas, his talent is a bit wasted.<br/><br/>If you want a modern sci-fi action/chase film, then watch 'Minority Report' which is brilliant. If you have to watch a Michael Bay film, then watch 'Armageddon' which has just as much action, etc. as 'The Island' and it's a decent film to boot."

","This is a highly entertaining movie which contains some fine performances and gives a clue to some of the moral dilemmas that we are going to have to face as a result of continuing technological advances.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are good as the lead characters who come to realise that their entire perception of the world is a lie. They believe that they are the survivors of a tragic event which has contaminated the Earth. They are kept in a state of the art facility with other'survivors'. All their hopes and dreams rest on the lottery which determines who may live in the only part of the world which is not contaminated (The Island). However, the Island although a Utopian dream is nothing short of a nightmare.<br/><br/>Sean Bean is the sinister villain who keeps the 'survivors' in a state of disillusionment at their expense and his own considerable gain. He seems to have taken Gary Oldman's position as the villain of choice for Hollywood producers. He is charismatic and on cue as usual. Steve Buscemi is fantastic in his self styled zany manor even though he only has a small role.<br/><br/>This film tackles an important issue of the future. To what extent can a person be considered a 'product' if they are the clone of another person? Is the clone the 'product' of the person that made him/her? The person who has been cloned? Or is the clone a person in their own right if they are able to think and feel? These moral questions of the future are lightly touched upon for the audience to ponder at their own leisure.<br/><br/>If the above issues seem heavy issues there is also plenty of fun to be found in this movie. There are plenty of chase scenes, explosions and some amusing moments. This was something of a financial disaster at the box office but do not let that put you off. What is Hollywood's loss is definitely our gain."

","I thought this the best science fiction movie I'd seen since Terminator 3. Yes, it has a lot of similarities to Logan's Run, but I thought it was a much better movie and the plot development and resolution went far beyond Logans Run. This movie was attacked universally by the critics in the United States, but so far it's pulled in between $250 and 300 million in Europe. I think the problem was that critics generally don't like science fiction, plus the pace of the movie confused them. The first half of the movie is quiet and dream-like but the last half has a lot of action mixed with romance and even some humor. I think the U.S. critics would have been happier with some kind of a one-dimensional movie. When I saw it in the theater, people actually applauded during the closing credits, which to me, means more than any critics opinion. I saw the War of the Worlds a couple nights later and I thought The Island was clearly the better of the two movies."

So how comes that movie was such a loss at the box-office (for sure the relatiely most unsuccessful in 2005)?

"Vomitron_G","7","0","0","12 February 2006"," Attack of the clones
","Of all the Michael Bay-movies I've seen, there's only one I liked and that's THE ROCK. But with THE ISLAND I can add a second one to the list. It's a rather good sci-fi/action-movie of the same size as, for instance, I, ROBOT. Only, THE ISLAND is a bit more believable and realistic. It actually is thought-provoking and raises some ethical issues about the whole cloning theme (and others too).<br/><br/>I won't give a synopsis, 'cause the less you know about the plot, the better. Even seeing the trailer first spoils some things. The first fifteen minutes or so of the movie had me thinking ""Nice, but I'm not buying it"". But very soon (even sooner than Ewan McGregor does) you'll figure out that things aren't what they seem. McGregor and Johansson are attractive as the lead characters and deliver a solid performance. Even though Johansson hasn't got much to do in her roll as Jordan Two Delta, you can still she that she has grown as an actress since, for example, GHOST WORLD. Steve Buscemi is always good, no matter what the man does. The cinematography and special effects are nothing less than excellent, as to be expected with a Michael Bay-movie. There was a perfect mix between present day and futuristic technology, which was all in all believable. But maybe they should have made the time-setting the year 2050 instead of 2019. The spectacular car-chase (with the truck and all) was certainly one of the high-lights of the movie. And it got even better when they switched vehicles, taking the action literally to new heights. What bugged me a little bit, however, was: How could Lincoln Six Echo, with his lack of experience, possibly be a better pilot than those professionals? Because he clearly was, since he managed to shake them off. Oh well, you shouldn't mind and just enjoy the ride, I suppose.<br/><br/>Michael Bay clearly is an American 'pur sang'. And that's one of the things I'd like to hold against him. That characteristic of him very much shows itself in the redundant last half hour of THE ISLAND when Bay shoves us all sorts of politically correctness down our throat. Me giving examples would spoil too much, so judge it for yourself. I'll only say that the final 'freedom'-shot (even though quite impressive) made me go 'Oh, please, noooo"". THE ISLAND actually should have ended with Lincoln and Jordan accepting their new identity, having the viewer decide what happens next. Granted, it would not be a spectacular ending as the one Bay came up with, but still Again, you shouldn't mind too much though, 'cause this is Michael Bay's THE ISLAND and not Michael Winterbottom's CODE 46.<br/><br/>Also, that last half hour contains the most unbelievable plot-elements of all (the hidden gun, too easily triggered explosions, no burn-marks when exposed to fire,...). So once again it's action over logic, but that's always the case with big-budget-popcorn-flicks, isn't it?<br/><br/>Finally, I might add that at one point or another THE ISLAND reminded me of Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD, LOGAN'S RUN, THE MATRIX, MINORITY REPORT and the afore-mentioned I, ROBOT. I must stress out the fact that THE ISLAND isn't a copy of any of those movies, but it just borrows some ideas & elements from them and simply reminds you of them. So if you liked those stories and movies, than THE ISLAND is right up your alley. And that goes the other way round too"
"hsvfxeditorial","9","0","0","12 February 2006"," Bay's best play...
","The Island marks Bay's first non Bruckheimer affiliated feature film, instead it was Steven Spielberg who called him up, sent him the script and ultimately signed him to do it. Good for him. Renowned for his fantastic visuals and heart pumping action this is Bay's first effort where he successfully combines these considerable talents with good storytelling.<br/><br/>Lincoln Echo six (McGregor) and Jordan Delta Two (Johansson) are two clones living a sterile, uneventful life among a whole population of clones in a tucked away super hi tech cloning facility. They are close friends, sometimes too close for the comfort of the many guards who monitor every aspect of their lives. Lincoln senses that something's amiss and questions his boring life, seeking release from the boring job and his daily toil. Once Jordan wins a trip to a mysterious island - the last uncontaminated place on Earth - Lincoln probes a little deeper and makes a gruesome discovery. Together with Jordan he escapes the facility and discovers what he has feared all along: his life was nothing but a big lie and the reason he exists is for spare parts. In a desperate efforts to keep his doings under wraps lead doctor Merrick (Sean Bean) spares no effort in recapturing his ""escaped products"".<br/><br/>This was truly one of the best films in a while, as always Michael Bay delivers excellent camera work, fast editing and suspense. He skillfully narrates what could have been a dull clone story in his unique style. Aside from the cool shots and sophisticated lighting/ production design McGregor and Johansson bring a lot to the film through their performances as do Steve Buscemi and the always great Sean Bean."
"Mr_PCM","7","0","0","2 February 2006"," Slightly different but still the same
","Michael Bay's latest offering of summer blockbuster action is 'The Island', a tale of clones being bred and used as insurance policies; they will be harvested if their 'sponsor' should need replacement organs. To ensure the clones are kept in tip-top condition, their lives are carefully managed and almost pre-programmed to believe that they will one day win the lottery and be chosen to go to paradise – the eponymous island. In fact all they 'win' is a trip to the operating theatre. When Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) discover the truth they escape and go on the run to start a new life, and find their 'sponsors'.<br/><br/>The Island is most definitely, to paraphrase a popular cliché, a film of two halves. Michael Bay, in his first major picture without the guiding hand of Jerry Bruckheimer, appears to be suffering from an identity crisis. To combat this he attempts to develop his own new identity, and thus the first half of the film seems to be almost a theological essay on the ethics of cloning. However, Bay inevitably cannot rein in his natural instinct to blow things up, and thus the second half of the film the whole inconvenient ethics dilemma falls by the wayside as the police and special forces pursue the two escaped clones across the country in a variety of chase scenes.<br/><br/>The main problem for 'The Island' is that it cannot make up its' mind what it wants to be. Does Michael Bay want to make a serious film to debate the issues of cloning or does he want to stick to what he knows best? As a result of this indecisiveness, the film flows like two halves clumsily meshed together.<br/><br/>However, if you can just sit back and try to get past the rather radical change in gear (and almost direction) then there is some fun to be had in the second half of the film. Few people do chase sequences like Michael Bay, and his first outing without Bruckheimer shows that he has just as much talent as his former collaborator. The highway chase involving flying motorbikes and 18-wheelers is real adrenaline-fuelled excitement. There are also numerous fish out of water gags as Lincoln and Jordan emerge from their sheltered lives into the real world, and find everything completely unfathomable (although they do pick things up very quickly!).<br/><br/>McGregor works hard here playing a dual role of clone Lincoln Six-Echo and his sponsor Tom Lincoln – the latter allowing him to use his natural Scottish accent. Johansson however does little more than play the textbook cute and smart blonde with no real depth to her character performance. Sean Bean, in another interesting change of pace, does not ham it up as the evil doctor, and instead gives a restrained, ambiguous performance – indicating that Bay is not prepared to comment too strongly on the ethics dilemma portrayed here. Steve Buscemi however is totally miscast as Lincoln's friend who helps them escape – even playing a nice guy he comes across as creepy, with a slight weasel-like quality. But then, he does that so well that his attempt at a change is admirable. Ethan Phillips provides a semblance of 'comic relief' while Djimon Hounsou plays the standard muscle-for-hire from the textbook.<br/><br/>Overall, as summer blockbusters go, this serves as reasonable entertainment – for the second hour at least. The first hour remains a light essay that doesn't want to get its hands dirty by digging too deep into the ethical dilemma of cloning. But perhaps this is just as well, as Bay's typical target audience don't want to think too much. It seems that he is caught between two directions – dumb down too much, or not quite dumbed down enough. But if you can disengage the brain, 'The Island' will prove reasonably diverting for a couple of hours, but will be forgotten not long after."

","The Island<br/><br/>From the director of The Rock, Bad Boys, Pearl Harbor. Michael Bay likes to make action movies. And he is quiet good in it. The Island is in comparison with most of his other movies more a quiet starter, building up to an action climax at the end. All together not a really fantastic film but it still touches a few warm topics of today, like cloning. Lincoln Six Echo(Ewan Mc Gregor) is living in a city along with other people, it's all inside because they are been told there is some kind of pollution outside and the ones in the complex are the lucky ones, the survivors of a world disaster. In fact are all of these people insurance policies from rich people outside who can use this clones to repair their own body. All of the clones are made in a few years to be an equal of the other living counterpart. They brainwash the clones so they cannot think of other things than mentioned in the brainwash, sex is something they don't know. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is a product that has difficulties, what means he starts to raise questions, to many questions. He is actually a production error. He meats a girl, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) and together they try to find out the truth of the lottery. The lottery is made to let the people of the complex dream of a future on a one-solitary island where they can go and which is not polluted. In reality they are used at that moment to fix the original buyer of the clones. Quiet an original film with an easy start building up to a full blow action movie at the end, what not really fits in this type of movie. Another chance blown for Michael Bay to make a really good movie, above average."

","I wanted to see this movie because it looked like an eerie remake of an old concept, where things aren't always as they seem and citizens in this utopian society discover a shocking secret.<br/><br/>I loved the feel the first part of the story had. Everything seemed very placid though you could tell things weren't quite right. The plot was already known by watching the trailers, but the actors did a good job of being fairly oblivious to the going ons of the story. It did look a little absurd to have Puma, Aquafina, Xbox and any other brand names in the habitat, but it was funny how the habitants didn't think anything of it.<br/><br/>As far as the leads, I thought they evolved well throughout the film. Scarlett Johansson plays Jordan 2 Delta and Ewan Mcgregor plays Lincoln 6 Echo. They are both extremely photogenic and they work well on the screen. I loved Ewan Mcgregor's improvisation with his clone, and there is a real contrast between his two roles. It could be said that the clones have very little character development, especially if you're an advocate of the nurture theory, so Lincoln 6, while having little personality, is a genuine character with the innocence of a child. His counterpart is a real ass and gets what's coming to him. I always love Steve Buscemi's sort of tell-it-as-it-is/realist attitude in his pictures and he does his job well in this picture as well.<br/><br/>Back to the plot. Lincoln six, being curious in nature, eventually finds out what the ""island"" actually is. A one way ticket to the operating room where you will be killed by lethal injection immediately after your body parts/baby. The scene with Michael Clarke Duncan is scary and is enough to give you the picture of what these peoples' business is.<br/><br/>After lincoln finds out, he rushes to prevent jordan from suffering the same fate. After that, Scarlett's line in the play sum up the next 45 min or so: ""Ruuuun!!!!"". It deteriorates into a chase film. The scenes are entertaining for sure, but logically it is a complete miracle they escape. The two scenes that they should have eliminated were the Mac truck scene and the ""R"" scene, where they fall off a huge logo. That's why I say this turned into a jaaf: Just another action flick.<br/><br/>There are many plot holes and logically, the whole part about innate knowledge of riding a hover cycle was frustrating. Being a nice person, I give it a seven."

"coppertop630","8","0","0","8 January 2006"," The Island: A tantalizing Contradiction
","I will be the first to say I loved the movie to death but to give it a fair review I won't use that fact as my sole momentum.<br/><br/>First, we'll take a look at the cast. Wonderfully chosen, I believe Ewan McGregor (though his accent is a bit shaky) is the perfect lead for this movie for three reasons. A) Hollywood does love beautiful people B) Let's face it, the wide range of skills he possesses is perfect for what they were asking of him, and C) I don't think anyone as well known can portray such a wide range of emotions and changes so well without overacting. As for Scarlett, I must say I get tired of that annoying, sexy, confused look on her face and I get tired and a bit dazed watching her eyes which are constantly moving every which way. It always looks like she's in a room with flashes of light that her eyes must follow. As for Sean Bean... what a well-chosen villain. Not only does Sean Bean play the doctor with a god complex very well, but his the deliverance of his final line in the movie... brilliantly executed. Let's not forget the comic relief Steve Buscemi who plays a character we like from the beginning. I don't think it's ever been so fun to love a bad guy.<br/><br/>Now, Let's get into the plot. Though I admit the plot has massive potential I think it is somewhat stunted and overshadowed by Michael Bay's NEED to destroy everything in sight. I just don't see how the whole building sequence added to the film at all besides giving me a reason to jump off a building and see if I land in a net. Let's face it, that was impossible and they emerged mark-less... But I'm off topic so I'll continue. Characters: Lincoln Six echo was very fun to watch and I think the writers did wonderfully at making him seem like a child and the gradual introduction of his doubts about his world was superbly done. Jordan Two Delta:... Hmmm... where to start. All I can say is that I love her character to pieces in that she's-so-dumb-but-gee-she's-cute-way. I think they left her character a little bit in the dust and wham! at the end, she's suddenly this smart, heroic, and violent woman? That kind of stuff doesn't happen over night and they waited too long to make her like that. Next is Laurent... I love how they switched his character like that. It's not sudden and we actually see him change and why. I think that that kind of character development is perfect and should really be used more often.<br/><br/>Now for the part that ISN'T fun. Special Effects were amazing... if you like shoot 'em ups and I don't for one reason and one reason alone. I think that if you have to sacrifice the sincerity and heart of a plot for buildings being blown up, cars being rolled down a highway, a giant logo falling off a building, and a flying motor bike flying through a building its not worth it. I think Michael Bay sacrificed what could have been the perfect plot for money and a chance at being a summer blockbuster hit and it sucked. Also, there are many elements missing because he wanted this movie to be viewable for a wider audience, thus he sacrificed an R-rating for... well, you guessed it, more money. And as for the love scene... I have to say I am disappointed, not because it wasn't explicit, don't get me wrong, but the way it played out. The script went a little down hill here.<br/><br/>There were also a number of errors in the film that cannot be explained. There is a little mess-up with the generations, there is no order to the system, and there are countless errors with characters. Let's look at Gandu three echo for instance who is of echo generation, which makes him three right? but he's been there seven years. Upon closer inspection you can easily see that the sequence on his sleeve is G3A, which means, you guessed it, they changed his character's name. Why? so we could see Merrick commit cold hearted murder. I admit, the scene added a new element to the movie which could only be described as Merrick's ruthless nature but Merrick doesn't strike me as hasty and the decision was hasty and desperate and there is no feasible way of explaining it to the rest of the population. and besides that, Gandu can be seen at the end, a free clone... strange...<br/><br/>Over all, I enjoyed the movie immensely and the soundtrack is wonderful but there are things I don't like about Michael Bay's ""style"". It's brutish and self-serving and didn't do a lot of good for the movie in the long run. Also, the DVD is lacking in features which no doubt means we will all have to spend an extra few bucks in the near future if we wish to see anything worth our time that wasn't in the movie."
"edbobed","Null","0","0","26 December 2005"," where was the advertising on this FILM???
","This movie rated higher in action and entertainment value than Mr.&Mrs.Smith, yet I only got to see it on Video. Asked around , and nobody I've talked to remembers it being sold on the tube. Not quite as action packed as Matrix, but the action wasn't as CG enhanced either, making it a bit more believable. Micheal Bay(director) starts off with his two heroes doing some kickass fight scene, Very cool. But then tapers off??? my question exactly. I'm thinking Scarlet(heroine) is gonna do some kickass fighting like Angelina Jolie, but Nooooo, Run scarlet run, see scarlet run. Casting was a little dubvious?? these guys and gals are sposed ta be clones for spare parts, so why are they looking like 50 yr old parts in some cases??? used parts?? Big Fan of back to the future, so where are all the futuristic cars?? think they'll still have gas in 50 years?? I don't think sooooooo. Imagination lacking(or maybe budget) aside, the story has really good pacing of action, just the ending being a wee bit anticlimactic. The story has a slow beginning, thinking maybe something like Star wars had introducing the gist of the movie a little quicker in script, or something, so the audience was wondering what the hell is this island, Island of Dr. Moreaux,King Kong Island, What???(ambiguity to say the least), or may change the name of the movie??( I CLONE), okay sounds too much like ""I ROBOT"". Gotta admit though , it was entertaining, and thats what matters, believing the action and storyline are happening for real. Nominate this movie for something would ya!! An Oscar maybe??"

","I keep hearing about these movies that tank and this was one of them. I think people are setting their standards too high. We have been spoiled by unprecedented spending and film quality over the last 15 years, and not everything that hits the theaters screams to us: we MUST pay $10 to see it.<br/><br/>With home entertainment options today, movies like this are on people's must see for when it's released on DVD. But, my value does not translate to $10 at the theater.<br/><br/>Movies like this, with a great plot and interesting characters with moderate twists are high in quality, but do not have star appeal.<br/><br/>Hollywood may try to tell people who the stars are, but the consumer catches on quickly.<br/><br/>I give this movie an 8 because it was pretty captivating. I just think that this is something I'd like to be pleasantly surprised while renting but don't want to be disappointed while paying $10 for it.<br/><br/>In that, we are finding the value of movie tickets. A movie is worth only what people want to pay for it. Hollywood is complaining of a ""down"" year. Dude, gas prices are $2.59 a gallon and Jude Law makes $20 million a film or whatever? Maybe I'll watch it on DVD.<br/><br/>Therefore, I'd be VERY happy with a $4.25 rental cost but disappointed with a $10 movie ticket. I'd say it's worth $7.50. And that, my friends, is Hollywood's problem. Not worse movies, but the prices have gone up so much in the last few years that people would rather pay $4.25 and watch it on their 46"" TV with a DVD player.<br/><br/>Why would I pay $10 for two seats, $6 for each popcorn, $5 for each soda, and $4 for each candy when I can do that total for $8 at my house? $50 to see the Island and be mad, or $8 and be happy? Hmmm....<br/><br/>Maybe I am making some sense.<br/><br/>Loved the movie. But it wasn't Deniro or Pacino in a classic."

The action they got; the moral dilemma and the scientific speculation fall short in several areas.<br/><br/>If you have to struggle at all with the right-or-wrongness of the idea that cloned humans have no rights and can be chopped up for spare body parts at the will of their ""sponsors,"" then you have to be considered beyond this discussion. Go ahead and enjoy the movie; it will look to you like a futuristic ""Die Hard."" The bad guy does his best to present the devil's case here  that cloned humans are cattle because they wouldn't exist otherwise. But the arguments are so weak even his hired guns don't buy it. What should have been explored was the moral culpability of the huge number of people who were in on it, but without time in the screenplay it is boiled down to the single line ""humans will do anything to survive."" The creamy Scarlett Johansson is heartbreakingly attractive, only slightly less pretty than her leading man Ewan McGregor. Although their characters they look like adults they are actually 4 and 3 years old, respectively, and educated to ""the level of a 15 year old."" As a mere footnote to the story, somehow Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor's character) not only starts behaving beyond his environmental programming, but somehow acquiring the memories of the man he was cloned from. This could be built into a profound theological and legal question, but instead it is merely used to help Lincoln Six Echo operate in the outside world.<br/><br/>What is left is still quite elaborate and interesting; just don't expect too much."

The clones think they're real. There is a lottery in the compound where they will be taken to an island paradise should they win, which is actually a cover for something more sinister. Two of the clones discover the truth and escape, trying to find their counterparts. I think this was a good film on the science fiction and action level. It was also laced with a little humor, as the scenes with Steve Buscemi's character and on the outside in the ""real world"" as they tried to adjust and were exposed to new things were actually pretty funny. There were a couple gratuitous chase scenes (which seem to be mandatory in films like this) which strained credibility and I feel like the film could have done with out or at least could have toned down a little bit.

"toast-15","9","0","0","29 December 2005"," A very brave movie to make considering the hostile climate for debate
","I just saw this movie and thought it was very good. It has a futuristic sci-fi setting, a science based debate, i.e., the moral or ethical value of cloning, plenty of action scenes, and lots of suspense. I saw this with a room full of people and we all thought it was great. I'm left puzzled by the poor critical reception it received and the bad marketing campaign. Maybe the critics were just upset that this movie dealt with the question of whether cloning creates another human life and they don't want people to think in those terms. Or, as some people like to say, it's not a life if it's in a petri dish. Even SCNT (somatic cell nuclear transfer) creates an embryo. When is it human? Are adult stem cells really inferior to embryonic stem cells? Or is it just more profitable to make a ""product"" (creating new organs or even new life with ESC derived from SCNT) rather than use existing adult stem cells to repair damaged organs. I don't believe you can patent adult stem cells, perhaps that's really why ESC are more ""valuable"" to some people. The movie makes mention more than once of the profit motive behind the clones.<br/><br/>The biggest advancement in ESC has been proved to be a fraud (see current headlines regarding S. Korean cloner.) I give the following link as a mere sample: http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20051227-041316-5554r but there are plenty more stories with more information.<br/><br/>By contrast, every time there is an advancement with adult stem cells, they mysteriously drop the ""adult"" to give the impression that the (adult) stem therapy has something to do with ESC when it doesn't. The reality is that stem cell breakthroughs touted in actual medical therapy have been achieved with adult stem cells, not ESC; yet ESC research gets more attention and more money.

The movie even had a great concept. They could really have done something with this list of ingredients. Sadly they didn't really make the best use of resources. The movie was good, but not great. Just above average, which is why I rated it a 6 (though I'd probably give it a 6.5 if IMDb supported half points, which it should IMO). But I rate tough too. I've never given a 10 and probably won't. After all, 10 is perfect.<br/><br/>This movie reminds me of the sad trend towards mediocrity in Hollywood in the last 10-15 years. A good example of this are the Phillip K.

","A Michael Bay film is never a quiet cerebral experience. One is not talking intellectual cinema, but Hollywood movie, big budget, corporate slick, and mass audience marketing. Thus, The Island can only be viewed from the position of what pleases the status quo. Although an intriguing premise opens the film -- an ocean setting, a ravishing beautiful couple (Scarlet Johanson and Ewan McGregor), and a big, faster than fast yacht in a turquoise pristine sea -- it is not a dream, it's a nightmare of Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor), a troubled young man with a vivid memory that haunts him. What is his world, purpose, and reality in an over regulated existence where adults are worker bees in an institutional setting, and where white, high key lighting bathes everyone in a literal aura. The daily routine is only broken by the chance of the lottery and dream to win a trip to ""the island -- nature's last pathogen-free zone."" <br/><br/>Lincoln has an interest in Jordan Two Delta (Johanson) but they can not touch nor would they seem likely to go further than a mere graze of the arm as all adults have a child like reasoning deficiency, including Lincoln. Proximity avoided, he begins to overtly question his situation, dream, lack of food and clothing choices, and what exists beyond the confines of the institutional prison where he is monitored, tested, and continually watched. Curiosity and skills seem to be developing in Lincoln that will lead to his violating the parameters of the agnate world and taking Jordan Two Delta along with him.<br/><br/>The Island digresses to a car chase bang-bang, bad guy versus good guy extended romp through Los Angeles freeways, high-rise buildings, and the desert. The intriguing premise is quickly rushed to the too obvious ending, and a superior cast of McGregor, Johanson, Sean Bean D'Jarmon Hinsou, and Steve Buccemi are wasted by the SFX, CGI, and over the top explosions. Blame director Michael Bays who makes a film for profit and profit only. Too bad it bombed, and what a disappointment for audiences who spent money to obtain the DVD which has only minimal added features and an all but monosyllabic narrative by the director. He has only himself to blame."

The first 45 min of this story involves some interesting ideas and is intriguing to say the least with contamination, proximities, a strange lottery and a built in sort of camp society similar to the Logans. However after the setup, the ideas sort of halt for a bunch of heavy duty action sequences reminiscent of Judge Dread. The lead actors are fun to follow although I would have liked to have seen more of the Buschemi character. That part of the storyline was underdeveloped and it seemed to have strength. Also I didn't care much for the last cut-away either. But, overall the movie didn't disappoint and actually overcame my expectations which I set kind of low to begin with.

","I enjoyed The Island very much and I must say that very early in I kept thinking about the late '70's film Logan's Run. Logan's Run was considered a very campy fun Science fiction film of it's day which subsequently had a spin-off TV show, which made no sense to me, but the film which I remember seeing as a preteen had so many similarities to The Island that I just had to believe that the writers and producers of it had to be thinking of Logan's Run during Pre-production! Even parts of the set were reminiscent. However, if this is what film recycling is bringing to the future then keep it coming. The Island took the best of Logan's Run and made it current, special effects, lighting, sound,chase sequences and fight scenes were a kin to the Matrix in some respects! The music was a little too much in the beginning act but the acting and direction made up for that little flaw. The current events plot and science/medicine vs soul/spirit themes are timeless. I considered it a top ten movie of the year although I would appreciate hearing anyone else's opinions on the Logan's Run similarities and I would have liked the producers admitting the recycling."

Since I like trains, I especially liked the train related stunts. Current medical ethics dilemmas are raised in this story about ""don't ask and I won't tell"" taken to the extreme. The future is portrayed as offering a lifestyle that is relatively comfortable for many and where the extremely wealthy can live much longer due to advances in medicine coupled with a certain moral flexibility to borrow a quote from another movie.

Clones DO NOT have the same fingerprints. A clone is not a copy of a person... it's a person with the exact same DNA. They'll have their own fingerprints and their own mind and conscience. In The Island, clones magically had the same fingerprints and some kind of memory imprint from their original counterpart. This concept is totally ludicrous in the field of genetics and cloning and unfortunately this movie only perpetuates false beliefs of an otherwise very promising field of study.<br/><br/>What was interesting is that the movie addressed other fact-based aspects of cloning which I won't get into here to avoid spoilers.

Anyone with any claim to know anything about the movies should have heard of McGregor and Johansson. Come on, who have missed Star Wars, Trainspotting, Lost in Translation, Girl with the Pearl Earring, Moulin Rouge and so forth? And with a supporting cast like Bean, Buscemi and Hounsou.

By and large, there are eye-candy CGI, exciting chasing sequences, and amazing story. Steve Jablonsky did a good job for composing music for this movie, and Ewan McGregor is excellent in acting.

","I don't think this movie deserves all the bad reviews it's gotten. Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but it is fun and exciting, and makes you think about some very relevant social issues. The movie is definitely science fiction and action, and will probably appeal most to fans of these kinds of movies.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is set a mere 15 years in the future, and it addresses a currently hot social (or is it political?) issue. (Spoiler alert). The main characters in the movie, (played with exquisite sexiness by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson) are clones, created for one purpose: to provide replacement body parts for their originals. (End spoiler).<br/><br/>The male, known as Lincoln Six Echo, is the focus of the movie. It is his mind that opens the movie, and forces the rest of the plot. Lincoln is dissatisfied with his life in a sterile underground institution. He and his fellows are told that they are lucky to be alive; that they are the sole survivors of a cataclysmic event that has poisoned the outside world, forcing them all to live in this underground facility. The goal in life of all good inhabitants of the facility is to win ""the Lottery."" Winning the Lottery means that the person gets to travel to ""The island,"" the last remaining toxin-free paradise on upper earth.<br/><br/>About the time that his good friend Jordan Two Delta (Johannson) wins the Lottery, Lincoln discovers that the real world and their place in it is disastrously different than they have been led to believe. Science fiction meets action when Lincoln begins to take control of his own life, and to help Jordan do likewise.<br/><br/>Lincoln and Jordan are fascinating and unique characters because they are incredibly naïve. Avoiding more spoilers, take my word for it that they have good reason to be naïve. This is interesting because it allows the characters to face simpler issues without dumbing down the movie. For instance, Lincoln is not allowed to have bacon for breakfast, and can't understand why. The audience knows why and can identify with his very real confusion, but they don't have to get all serious and deal with complex emotional issues.<br/><br/>It's easy to find things to criticize about ""The Island."" There are numerous plot holes, rampant product placement, and so much more the movie could have done. Yet it is still a good movie. It's fun to discuss the plot holes and could-have-beens with your friends, especially for those of us who are interested in how movies are produced. Whether or not you mind the product placement is, I guess, a matter of taste. Personally, I've never been bothered by product placement; I usually don't even notice it.<br/><br/>For the intellectual among us, ""The Island"" offers lots of fodder for discussion.

","The concept of this movie is one of the best, most original ideas I've seen in a film in ages, and reminded me of Gattaca in the sense that with the way science is going, it may be a very good preview of our future. Unfortunately, they gave the idea away during the making-of/trailer I saw a few nights before the movie came out. That was the first mistake - it would've been better had this come as a surprise. The second mistake was adding in half an hour of unnecessary running around mission-impossible style, which made the film less believable because they just seemed to survive one impossible situation after the next.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie has a hot cast with some great acting, and a lot of research and creativity clearly went into the making of this film. Highly recommended providing you go to the toilet just before the film. 9/10"

","After I've seen the film, I felt pretty much the same after watching the Minority report. But I think MR was better. I like those SF ideas of future, but the directors nowadays don't even give the idea a chance, they start something, you realize it in a half an hour, and then suddenly you get to see 2h of all the police vans, cars and helicopters that can fit the screen...chasing two persons that don't know how to even drink a coffee in a real world...and can't get them! I don't know, it's silly to me. I get bored after half an hour of that. Every woman in the world will agree that it's impossible to climb on the building commercial, while wearing 10cm heals :) Ewan is good actor, Scarlet too, and they did a good job here (plus, they're nice couple).

","The Island ***+<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is one of my definitely favourite actors, and Scarlet Johansen made a nice impact on me in Lost in Translation. They were the biggest reasons for me to see The Island. As a whole The Island is not a bad movie and actually Ewan and Scarlet make quite a nice couple in the movie.<br/><br/>The story of people in white, kept locked in an institution without knowledge of the outside world has been told pretty many times. That is why The Island did not bring anything really new to the movie business. The overall feeling when watching the movie was ""this is OK action"". There were some scenes that I really liked, like for example the agnates (clones) learning to live in the real world: Jordan 2-Delta (Scarlet) ordering a drink in a bar and Lincoln 6-Echo (Ewan) asking the bartender where Mac (Steve Buscemi) was and for example Jordan and Lincoln learning how to kiss.<br/><br/>I really like action films, but I also like to have at least something new in the storytelling. That is why the chase scenes and cars exploding were not that interesting, and made me wish to press the fast forward button in my remote (but I was in a movie theatre so I could not). The chase scenes were far too extended (could have been cut at least half) and too much of the action rested on big explosions and crashing cars. Nothing new about that, we've all seen that many times.<br/><br/>What I liked were the actors' performances: Ewan and Scarlet made a good job, Steve Buscemi as an alcoholic tech guy was brilliant, and I even liked Sean Bean as the money-and-power-hungry leader of the cloning facility. Even the story was good in its own way. Just that there was too much effort to make the movie look ""cool"" with big explosions and extended chases - that was something that make me lose interest at times. But if you want to relax your brain for a couple of hours, this is good entertainment. A good ""day after"" movie when you're too tired to think :)<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER<br/><br/>This movie raised a moral question though: should the clones have been allowed to continue their lives in the real world?

","The Island directed by Michael Bay is a spine chilling action movie with enough stuff to keep you glued to your seat till the credits roll on the screen. What happens when your Insurance policy is sitting in your living room in front of you ? Well don't get puzzled ! The Island is the answer to it.

"stu9003","5","0","0","24 September 2005"," Starts off strong then goes downhill once things start to blow up
","The Island is almost like two separate movies. It starts off as a very interesting sci-fi flick with a really interesting premise: there's a futuristic society, a global plague, an island paradise, and a sense that something isn't right. The director painstakingly builds the tension and the sense of unease until Ewan MacGregor's character finally discovers the truth.<br/><br/>Shortly after that, all those sci-fi ideas are abandoned and the film degenerates into an all-out action flick where the story is largely irrelevant. There's nothing wrong with action, but this is truly dumbed-down, outlandish stuff. In one scene, our two main characters fall forty stories or so out of a tall building and then get up and walk away. Then there's another completely ludicrous scene in which the man sent to hunt our heroes is faced with two identical Ewan MacGregors and he must decide which one to kill. I'm still not sure what he based his decision on.<br/><br/>This movie could have been a lot better if they hadn't dumbed it down so much in the second half. There were some great possibilities and some really interesting ideas that were abandoned. One example I'm thinking of is the notion that clones will eventually begin to obtain the memories of the people they were cloned from. They throw this idea out there as an important plot point and then never mention it again."

","The beginning starts off really well, it's abit like the beginning of HalfLife 2. Big screens everywhere, everyone walking in white clothes, etc. It gets kinda funny when you realize that everything in the first hour of the movie seems to resemble Macintosh. White is the only color (just like with the IPods), and near to the end of the movie the PR guy asks a visitor if he wants 'an apple' (the fruit). The truck in the chase-sequence of the movie is branded 'I Mack'. I have to admit it's funny, if it was intended that way. Explicit advertising for MSN Search and XboX however, proves different. The facility as a Macintosh-like structure which houses evil experiments and huge limitations to the human mind (altho the persons were grown in a few months while indoctrinated, and the main characters are only for years of age, they have the knowledge of a fifteen year old kid and that's all it's ever gonna be) can be regarded as Macintish-bashing (God knows I looked at it that way). Once the 'products' are in LA (the Free World) everything looks like one big Microsoft commercial (and yes, Salty Dog and Puma also invested in this movie). While chattering about the value of human existence they throw Microsoft-like high tech stuff in the mix like 'hey guys, we're empowering your freedom'. Here comes the biggest spoiler: once the main character destroys the facility, all inhabitants see the light and happily escape to explore the Free World. By that time I was looking to the movie like I was watching Nazi propaganda during history class.<br/><br/>Now here comes a quick review: it is a decent action flick with nice camera work and good fx. Reminded me abit of Universal Soldier, but all MS propaganda aside (and if it wasn't too obvious) there's plenty of fun to be had. Big plus: Steve Buscemi as the main character's Partner in Crime. He is one of the few actors who isn't over-acting as if it was a clean and kid-friendly version of Total Recall.<br/><br/>Sorry for Windows-bashing in this review, but I use Linux and this website's probably hosted on an Apache-server (just like most sites out here)."

","I saw The Island quite recently and expected, from what I had read from other critics, to be watching a mindless summer blockbuster action movie. The critics, I am glad to say, were wrong. This is a well put together movie with something to please just about anyone looking for something more than action.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor reveals a fair amount of un Hollywood humour in this movie as well as a brief glimpse into his Scottish Generation X persona. This is shown up quite well when his 'clone' or 'insurance policy' as McGregor's Tom Lincoln calls him, turns up at Tom Lincoln's posh house. Pity we never get to meet Scarlet's human being although we glimpse her too from one of the adverts that Johanssen made for a perfume company (!). Other players are good as well. Steve Buscemi is as he always is but Sean Bean is, in my opinion, a little bit too understated although he has a nice hard edge about him as the mad doctor of the piece.<br/><br/>The action scenes are very well realised, although I am not a big fan of hand held camera action and fast paced blink and you'll miss it filming which doesn't allow the eye to linger too much over what's going on. And my other grumble, which is typical of a lot of film makers today is the scenic helicopter swinging around on the main couple shot which has been done to death. Enough of that.<br/><br/>All in all, not bad at all. And McGregor looks so much happier doing this than any of the Star Wars films he was involved in."

","First let me say that cloning Ewan MacGregor has to be one of the most brilliant ideas ever! Now with that out of the way... I enjoyed watching The Island. The idea appealed to me, and so did the wonderful soundtrack. It's the kind of music that stays with you even though you can't replay it in your mind. I'm a sucker for these ""victory of the human spirit"" type movies. That being said, although this movie had all the makings of a good product, it pretty much sold its soul. We have tons of product placement (Puma and Nokia for example), Hollywood clichés and huge plot holes. I love Ewan Macgreggor, but his character was so bland and unidimensional that virtually ANYBODY could've played him. Same goes for Scarlett Johanson and Sean Bean. Djimon Honsou was OK, but I could tell from the get-go he's gonna turn by the end of the movie, and Buscemi was simply there as a plot device. I still love to see these actors on screen, all of them. This movie has a higher concentration of actors I love then any other in previous history. And yet I feel it had a lot of potential, potential to really teach us a lesson about what our future holds if we're not careful. But who cares the future when you got a box office in the present to worry about."

","I liked the island, i don't think it is completely original, because we have seen many of those scenes and ideas before, in movies like Minority report, I robot, Blade runner, Antz, and many others, but in general it is entertaining. I think that the director should have taken more care of the small details, for example i suppose your clone would be you 'in the original way' in the sense that it would be what you look like without make up, haircut, hair color, etc. so i don't understand why scarlet Johanson's character has blond hair when you can clearly see the roots of her hair are very dark, so her original color is dark, that's the color of hair the clone should have, i suppose. she also wears make up and nail polish, and a haircut, i don't know why. this may sound stupid to some, but it is a detail. if they removed the sex bribe, why does she jump at him in the end? Michael Clark Duncan was very good, short part but intense. The movie has good lines also, and it is an interesting story to be told. even more with all the crap there is in theaters nowadays. The end is a little silly, what are all these clones going to do in the outside world, without money, homes, etc? In general, it was fun to watch."

","I didn't have high hopes for The Island as I heard it had not done very well in America, despite starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. However, I was pleasantly surprised as I found it watchable and exciting, despite some cheesy dialogue and implausible action.<br/><br/>It's the year 2019 and the population lives in 'the Institute' as the outside world is contaminated. Every so often, someone wins the 'Lottery' and can go and live on 'the Island'; the last uncontaminated area in the world. Everyone wants to win the Lottery! However, we (the audience) know that there is something else going on here! Lincoln 6 Echo (McGregor) accidentally stumbles across the real reason why people get sent to the Island - everyone at the Institute is a clone paid for by someone in the outside world to harvest if they need an organ transplant or to have a baby without going through pregnancy for example. He manages to escape with Jordan 2 Delta (Johannson).<br/><br/>The film then changes pace as Lincoln and Jordan are on the run from a group of mercenaries hired by Dr Merrick (Sean Bean), the head of the Institute, to recapture the 'products'. A high-octane (and highly improbable) chase sequence ends with Lincoln and Jordan tracking down Tom Lincoln (the sponsor of his Lincoln 6 Echo). There follows some amusing (perhaps not intentionally funny) scenes with two Ewan McGregors on screen with 6 Echo trying to get Lincoln to help him expose the Institute.<br/><br/>The Island seems to be caught between being a futuristic sci-fi film (with its elements of outside contamination, an unobtainable Utopia, cloning) and being an action, shoot 'em up type of film and ends up being neither one or the other. Don't go and see it if you expect to see an intelligent examination of the ethics about cloning, but if you want to go and see a good thriller which is a bit different to other action films out at the moment, then you can't go too far wrong!"

In this case clones, in supposed vegetative states, are made of exact copies of people who can afford them in case they need a new kidney or something like that. But these clones are actually alive and live in an underground facility not knowing about the real world above them.

"Antagonisten","6","0","0","3 September 2005"," Not the mess i feared it would be
","Living in backwoods Sweden it's always custom to hear a lot of things about movies before the finally reach us out here. And this movie was more or less written down before it even arrived. Attendancy was poor, the studio blamed the actors for being.. well terrible actors! The actors blamed the studio for poor marketing. It all seemed like a piece of crap that nobody really wanted to take responsibility for. After actually seeing the movie i sort of wonder why.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is one of the most awful directors active today. He completely lacks all sensitivities vital to a successful director. He has no sense of pace, no sense of mood and absolutely no sense at all when it comes to temperance. Bay is more or less just about one thing: spend as much money as possible and make as much noise as you can while doing it. Considering his previous works i guess they must have had him restrained during the first half-hour of the movie because it's actually quite calm and controlled.<br/><br/>The actors are the main upside to the movie i would have to say. Glorious computer effects and action scenes with dozens of cars being smashed, helicopters exploding and people flying left and right are commonplace today. So that's not really an incentive for me to see a movie. Good acting on the other hand, now that is something i'm willing to pay for. And i think i get my money's worth here. Scarlett Johansson is decent enough as the female protagonist and Ewan McGregor makes his usual solid performance, although in my opinion Sean Bean outshines them both. They show once again what ""The Bourne Identity"" taught Hollywood, that even in action movies decent actors go a long way.<br/><br/>So what's the backside? Well i would have to say Michael Bay. Because after a while it seems he managed to escape from his restraints and from then on it's full speed ahead and ""insert earplugs"". Bay goes ahead and does what he always does, let's a couple of dozen million dollars explode with loud bangs. All accompanied by shaking cameras, epilepsy-inducing editing and loud music. So while i would probably call this the best movie Michael Bay has managed to make to this day, it's not thanks to his directing, rather despite it.<br/><br/>Beside his major flaws as a director the other cons of the movie sort of fade away. Oh, i noticed them (like extremely obvious and silly product placement, a plot with more than a couple of holes etc.) but i didn't mind them much. In the end this is an entertaining ride, entertainment for as long as it lasts. And simple mindless fun is not something to despise, just as long as you realize what it is you're watching. ""The Island"" is far from the mess i feared it would be, and it's a lot better than most crap i've seen in theaters this summer. I rate it 6/10."

","The Island is a movie that showed a lot of potential in its first hour, but unfortunately, it fell apart after that when it turned into another popcorn summer action flick.<br/><br/>The story of The Island happens in the near future. The entire earth has been contaminated. The people who survived the contamination now live in a Utopian facility. Their only goal in life is to win the lottery, because the winner gets the chance to live the rest of his life in the island, the only place on earth that was not contaminated. <br/><br/>The 2 halves of The Island are like 2 separate movies. The first half is a thought provoking sci-fi. It raises a lot of intriguing questions like ""How clones should be treated, as products or as human beings?"" & ""Is there a paradise (an island) for the believers (the ones who win the lottery)?"" Unfortunately, the second half was your typical Michael Bay movie, so you know what to expect: big explosions, car chases, quick cuts, and loud music. That half wasn't bad by any means, but the problem is that the first half was so much better that the second half felt worse than it really is. Also, there was little originality in that half, unlike the first one. <br/><br/>The Island had a big cast, but the majority of the actors had almost nothing to do. Michael Clarke Duncan & Steve Buscemi were on-screen for about 15 minutes, and Djimon Hounson did nothing but shout phrases like ""You can't let them get away, You have to catch them, Etc"". Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean gave good performances, but I was let down by the performance of Scarlett Johansson. Considering her talents and her past work, I expected much more from her.<br/><br/>I have to say that Michael Bay did a good job in directing The Island. The sets were great, the pacing was generally good, and for the first time in his career, he directed a movie that will make the viewers think during and after watching it. Anyway, I think the special effects looked fake in the aerial pursuit scene, and I think the car chase scene was worse than the one Bay has made in Bad Boys 2. <br/><br/>So I'd recommend watching The Island.

","Any film directed by Michael Bay (think ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", ""Pearl Harbor"") is going to be loud, brash and even over-the-top and ""The Island"" is no exception. This is his first venture though into science fiction (the movie is set in the USA of 2019) and he has fun with some antiseptic habitats, medical laboratories, towering city structures, and futuristic forms of travel, ensuring that sooner or later everything is blown apart with the maximum noise and bits. You might be reassured to know that companies such as Microsoft and Nokia are still thriving in 2019, although it could just be product placement.<br/><br/>The plot - such as it is - features Ewan McGregor as Lincoln Six-Echo and Scarlett Johnsson as Jordan Two-Delta who look human enough, but soon find that their world, the island and, everything they thought they knew is not what is seems. Appealing support roles come in the form of Sean Bean (why is the bad guy usually a Brit?), Steve Buscemi (always wonderfully quirky), Djimon Hounsou (a few more lines than in ""Gladiator""), and Michael Clarke Duncan (""The Green Mile"").<br/><br/>We've seen all the elements before: replicants on the lose (""Blade Runner""), implanted memories (""Total Recall""), adults in child-like sexual discovery ""Demolition Man""), a man meeting his clone (""The 6th Day""), and several scenes (especially the final escape) are taken straight out of ""Logan's Run"".

"kskezz","6","0","0","25 August 2005"," Fun but flawed
","This movie was entertaining, though slightly disappointing. I foolishly expected to see a film in which clones run for their lives on an actual island, but there was no island. That was my first disappointment.<br/><br/>The other disappointments mainly came from the abundance of plot holes and unanswered questions. The idea for this film has great potential but sadly this is not reached. Some of the questions I found myself asking include: 1) Merrick (Sean Bean) said that creating vegetated clones did not work, as the transplants failed if they had not experienced conscious life and emotion. But why? There is no conceivable reason why livers or kidneys need to experience consciousness in order to function properly. 2) Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) miraculously grew his original's memories. How? This is never explained. 3) How did the company manage to get away with the massive public scenes they caused as 'cops'? 4) The clones do act childlike and innocent, but not nearly as childlike or undeveloped as their actual age, which is mostly between 6 months and 3 years. The clones are sculpted and educated carefully by the company, but surely it is not possible to get a 2 year old human to the intellectual level of a 15 year old through a careful selection of TV shows? 5) And more to the point, why did they go to so much trouble to educate the clones to 15 year old level anyway? Their entire purpose, after all, is to provide spare parts for their originals.<br/><br/>I could go on but I think I have made my point. <br/><br/>Despite all of this, the movie was not without its perks. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson play their roles well and manage to give the film some comical moments. Steve Buscemi is his usual quirky and lovable self, and the rest of the acting isn't too bad either. Also the action scenes are exciting, well done and a little bit OTT  just the way I like them. <br/><br/>Another thing I liked was the idea of two fully grown adults discovering sex together having never known anything of it before. And also, of course, the nice dig at the president.<br/><br/>This movie, although flawed, is worth seeing. Overall I would give it 6/10."

Also they are just clones in the end so i can't really feel sorry for them...the whole point of them being born in the first place is so they can be used for parts or whatever so i don't see the point of them wanting freedom when really they are just like robots!

","I thought the film started slowly and took a bit of time to get going, but once the pace sped up things began to get good Not being a great admirer of sci-fi stories, with worries that it was going to be another equilibrium type film i found it very enjoyable and would watch again They seem to depict an odd futurist world, a society that can clone people but still can't stop credit card fraud. It seemed to be stuck between the modern day and future image that I, Robot did so much better.<br/><br/>The cast is good, mainly British which is nice to see. Ewan and Scarlett play the characters well along with Sean Bean, although it would be nice to see him in a Hollywood film where he isn't the bad guy.<br/><br/>There are lots of parts where the story gets thin but take it on face value and just enjoy the ride"

","I really did enjoy myself at this movie. The first half, especially, was intriguing. I already knew the premise of the film, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the plot as it unrolled bit by bit. I have to admire Ewan MacGregor's wise decision to affect an American accent for the scenes where he played ""the clone"" (Lincoln 6 Echo)...and later, when his ""sponsor"" (Tom Lincoln) is introduced, he uses his own Scottish accent. The CGI was used well in the scenes where MacGregor acted with himself. The plot was well written so that it was hard to predict where it was going, especially during the first 3/4 of the movie. The last half of the film turned into an action film, and for my taste, there was a bit TOO much action. I know that I am in the minority on this, but I don't like it when there are so many explosions one after the other; after a while I just get numb to it, and it gets to be monotonous. But that's really a minor complaint. The movie was entertaining from beginning to end, and the acting by MacGregor and Scarlett Johanson was excellent."

","We start out in a THX 1138 style facility. We ask what is going on, who are these people. Why are they here? The conversation is interesting, the acting is decent. Interesting questions about a moral issue come to our minds. We see this nice place yet we feel something is fundamentally wrong with the situation. As one of the individuals questions things going on around him, the horrible truth is revealed.<br/><br/>After this, what we see degenerates into standard Hollywood/Michael Bay action fare with dire dialogue (consisting of the words ""go!"", ""move out!"" etc. etc.). The action is good, but lacks soul and appears as mere eye candy. Let's face it, the two leads were hardly stretching their acting abilities.<br/><br/>The ending part of the experience revives a little of the intrigue of the first part, but it has taken so long to get here that we really don't care. Did we really expect it to end any other way? Throughout the movie we are constantly subjected to multiple product placement opportunities, some so glaringly obvious that you almost feel the need to scream. We paid to see a movie, not be advertised at. It is also very much oriented at males - action/women etc., and even if you were a lady I wouldn't even recommend this movie just for another chance of seeing McGregor in action. Cool music though.

Micheal Bay did a good job directing this flick. The camera angles and all that were awesome. It had a good balance of romance, suspense, action and drama. Wonderful jobs by all the actors, highlighting Scarlett Johanson and Sean Bean. Merrick says that the clones were childlike and Johanson pulled off that childlike feeling to her character. While McGregor, though seeming very childlike at times, seemed some of the time just to be stupid. Sean Bean as the evil doctor Merrick was a weird and twisted character. He believes he's doing good and that the clones he ""makes"" are nothing more than tools to be used. Sean Bean pulled off a wonderfully heartless and somewhat disturbing Merrick.

"klesker","5","0","0","18 August 2005"," Typical Michael Bay
","I feel somewhat disappointed in the circumstances in which i saw this film. There were two choices as i stood in the Que of my local cinema, one being Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and one being the new Michael Bay movie. Alas i was overruled by my fellow friends and i am still yet to see the new Delight from the unquestionable Depp/Burton collaborative team.<br/><br/>That's not to say i didn't want to see this. For all his flaws, Mr. Bay can produce some entertaining popcorn fodder. Both Bad Boys and The Rock had their moments and Armageddon is still watchable (albeit only on the odd, rare occasion). I'd rather not mention Pearl Harbour (notice the ""U"" is intact) or Bad Boys II although they, too, had some pretty impressive moments.<br/><br/>The Island, on the outset, looks like a break from the regular Bay/Bruckheimer mold (The fact that old Jerry ain't involved in this one is a huge step in the right direction). It deals with some very interesting themes (Cloning. Should we/Shouldn't we?) and features what i call ""guenuine"" actors rather than the next pretty face to appear on MTV.<br/><br/>And it works...well almost.<br/><br/>For all it's promises, this is, at the end of the day, a Michael Bay Movie, and however high my hopes were, they all came crashing down on that basis. What is it with this guy and cutting every 30 seconds? I may not be in the business Michael but i know that cutting on this magnitude is only a hindrance. There is no need for it so, in future DON'T DO IT! It is also apparent that he feels more at home when the carnage starts. The first act of the film feels..not rushed but haphazard. The only truly engaging scene, i felt, was McGreggor's 1st encounter with bad-guy of the year Sean Bean. His constant questioning of the environment around him provides a brief glimpse of the turmoil that's about to unfold. But this is not enough i'm afraid (the scene happens some 10minutes into the film). Until things start going tits up, the film buckles on it's own premise, unsure of how to achieve what it set out to do.<br/><br/>Once the pace picks up however, Bay is in his element. In a bizarre twist, the major saving grace of this film is Bay's precise knowledge of how to blow sh*t up. An boy does he put this knowledge to good use. Explosions, car chases, more explosions, more car chases. Once our Protagonists are on the run it seems that nothing is safe from bay and his pyrotechnic team. And although you can't help but titter and the extreme amount of collateral damage caused, you can't help but stare in awe at the raw intensity of the middle act.<br/><br/>And one can't accuse Bay of lacking in style. This film is full of it. Even when the film lags or feels uncomfortable (and with the excessive cutting you bound to feel uneasy) it is still stunning to look at. The noir drenched look of the real world as a dark, dinjy, dirty place. The calm, paradise-esquire feel of the cloning facility. All these aspect enhance the emotions of our characters, and many a camera technique shows this too.<br/><br/>It is the third and final act however that causes the audience to crave something more. The man on a mission side of things seems tired and used, as McGreggor sets out to save his fellow clones. The clichés are as transparent as they are obvious and, in all honesty, a bore to watch. By the time the final cringe-worthy moments arrive i had had enough.<br/><br/>It is as if it is 3 films as opposed to 1 as it comes off as a Sci-Fi-cum-fugitive-on-the-run-cum-man-on-a-mission mish-mash. You can't blame Bay for trying, but what he has here is something that could've been so much more. Not a complete failure, but still a disappointment. A truly promising concept has been turned into your generic action yarn.<br/><br/>3/5"

Whilst this one reminds you at times (mainly by the images, rather than the plot itself) to ""Minority report"" or ""The matrix"", you can still see its own scenario and the actors help you see past the script and straight into an amazing story. Special effects feel a bit excessive at times, but the brilliant soundtrack makes your head deal nicely with the amount of explosions and chases there are. This film has also got the exact amount of simple jokes that will make you laugh from time to time without thinking they are trying too hard.

","From the director of Bad Boys and Armageddon comes this futuristic thriller that explores the notion of human cloning. McGregor plays a man who lives in a controlled environment where human contact is prohibited, true emotions don't exist, and everyone dreams of winning a vacation to a mysterious island with no questions asked. When he finally does question his seemingly futile existence and the work of its shady doctor (Bean), he finds out more then he ever imagined endangering his own life and also that of his closest friend (Johansson). Has a bit more substance than previous Bay efforts, and a plot that actually holds your interest, but relies predominantly on action scenes for effect and lacks a really solid finale.

Cue all manner of mayhem from train wheels to big rocket bikes. The acting is fine as there's not really a whole lot needed. Steve Buscemi makes a welcome appearance but alas not for too long. There's not much time to take a breath here and it all rolls along predictably enough to the inevitable climax and over-the-top final scene, where something more subtle would have worked better (but that's not a word that's in this director's vocabulary).

","'The Island' is a typical summertime movie - lots of action, very well filmed by the way, based on a science-fiction idea. The problem is that the premises are very good, so the limitation that director Michael Bay placed on himself really make you feel sorry that he did not aim higher. The first half hour looks very much in staging and idea to the early Lucas film THX-1138, all at bigger scale, of course. So that when this anti-orwellian theme is transformed in yet another car races and urban landscape destroying feast, you start feeling that this film could have been better, maybe getting close to 'Matrix' or 'Blade Runner'.

","All right, I might as well go ahead and prepare to take some heat from all you Bay haters (Michael Bay, that is) out there. You ready? *ahem* *stretches neck* ... I liked The Island! There. I said it. And let me make it easy for you...<br/><br/>""Hey Johnny, how much is the studio payin' you?"" ""What up, shill? Must be nice being a studio plant."" Cut and paste the one you like the best into an email and send it along. I haven't started a Cafe Press page selling ""Michael Bay - World's Greatest Director"" t-shirts or anything, but come on, the man knows how to deliver the action goods. The Rock is only one of the best action films of the 90s. Nicholas Cage was rockin' the Casbah in those days, and you know it. Even though I don't think there are Casbahs in North America.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Island is destined to be one of those movies that pleases most moviegoers, yet irritates the elitist critics. You've heard their complaints before: It's too loud! There are too many car chases! Bay's so in love with explosions that he might as well propose to them! This is just pretty people involved in action sequences! There are too many plot holes! I'm not sure why so many critics were willing to ignore some of those same issues with War of the Worlds but are so outspoken about them in regard to The Island. Still hopin' for that Spielberg interview I guess. But you know what? I like explosions! I like really cool car chase scenes! And doggone it; I thoroughly enjoyed watching Ms. Johansson run away from trouble in those tight little white jumpsuit pants of hers. Granted, the outfits are goofy. I'm pretty sure my entire family (with the exception of me) had some almost like that during the late 90s when swishy jumpsuits were all the rage. But Scarlett wears it well.<br/><br/>The story behind The Island might not be overly original (yes, it combines elements of Logan's Run, THX 1138, Blade Runner, The Clonus Horror, etc.), but it's fairly interesting nonetheless. And it's not a subject that is too far-fetched. You've got a company that, through a $120 billion investment, has started to clone humans. People who can afford it can have themselves cloned in case they need an organ transplant in the future. After all, it's the American dream to live forever (how else do you explain Joan Rivers' 24 face lifts?), so there are plenty of investors willing to try to expand their lifespan by 60-70 years. Have you seen what people do these days in the name of preserving their beauty? I have no doubt there are people today with enough money (and little ethical concerns regarding cloning) who'd be up for this.<br/><br/>However, the investors are told that the clones will be kept in a vegetative state, so when it's discovered that the organs fail without life or consciousness the hijinks begin. Sean Bean, in what has to be his 47th role as a bad guy, runs the facility and views the clones as nothing more than tools and instruments. The trick is the clones view themselves as humans. We all know that heads will eventually butt and shenanigans can't help but ensue.<br/><br/>The Island is a movie that has a thought-tickling message it wants to touch on, but its main goal is to give moviegoers a lot of cool things going boom in a somewhat believable and futuristic fashion. It definitely succeeds on that level, and for that reason I was able to ignore the plot holes and minor squabbles. What's harder to ignore is the blatant product placement.<br/><br/>Sheeeeeesh, got a few sponsors to make happy? I guess one thing Bay can't be accused of is being subtle. Prepare to be bombarded with close-ups of Xbox, MSN Search, Aquafina, Nokia, Ben & Jerry's, etc. Much like DJ Qualls' nose, it does stick out quite obviously, but if you can ignore it or laugh it off then you'll be just fine."

Yes there was some good action, and the base concept of the move was quite good. And then there was that Laurent guy, who in my opinion did the best acting in the movie, maybe except for Ewan MacGregors double role. I never expected Ewan to be able to be such an complete asshole. so yes that was good acting. Sean Bean was an utter disappointment. He is usually much better in playing more or less psychotic persons. but this wasn't what stopped the movie of going from decent to good. I don' know what it was. All the things needed to make it a really good sci-fi was there. It just...flopped. I never really was caught by this movie. I wasn't pulled in. I kept sitting there in the movie theater, thinking; something is missing. Maybe it was that neither Scarlet nor Ewan seemed to be really interested in doing their best. They just went through the motions of making a movie. A few times it actually seemed as if they wished they were somewhere else, especially Scarlet. But to be fair, I can understand it if she was a bit uninterested, since she never really had to do anything in the movie. I got the feeling the director just wanted a pretty female co-player to Ewan.I believe Scarlet could have done considerably better if the script just allowed her to. Inside the complex in the beginning, she didn't seem so bad. but as soon as they were on the run, she just stumbled after Ewan and wasn't any help at all.<br/><br/>Okay, enough complaining here.

However you begin to notice some of the movies drawbacks early. There is a shameful amount of product placement in this movie that made it difficult to really appreciate the story when there are giant brooding billboards behind the characters and the logos to their cars and clothes are easily visible. I found it hard to believe that the corporation would buy Aquafina water and Puma shoes for their clones. About an hour into the movie the movie changes pace from a clever thriller to a typical loud Michael Bay film. Once they escape the barracks in which they are kept they spend the next hour and a half of the movie running away through a city. Not only does this get boring but you begin to wonder, why are there 20 2005 Chryslers on the same street in 2020?.

I need it more like Ewan McGregor needs a different look, he looked just like Christian, the CLB from Smackdown. And now, all I can think about is seeing this movie again!

Their one goal in life is to win the lottery where the prize is a transfer to ""the Island"", the only uncontaminated spot left on earth. But there is no island! One clone figures out something is wrong and he and his friend escape. What follows is a pretty decent action film, complete with miraculous feats of survival. Not only do they survive getting shot at multiple times, they survive being in a car that gets hit by a truck AND a fall from a 70 storey building. The end raised a couple of questions - why did they all rush outside at the end when they though it was contaminated for one. Scarlett Johansson plays Jordan 2 Delta. Apart from a pretty face and some wanabee-Angelina lips what's the big deal about her? She doesn't seem to be anymore talented than any other actress. So she was in Lost in Translation? Who cares? What a boring load of yawn that was. It's good to see us British are still being considered for a variety of roles in Hollywood, playing the villain for a change in this one. (Ok, technically Ewan McGregor is British but note his American accent in the film. When he has his Scottish accent you will not fail to notice he is playing a ""baddie"").

All of his other movies i have found quite disappointing, never really reaching the top of the pack; which i feel has always been because of the story line, as the action sequences always take over.<br/><br/>At the beginning Micheal creates a very interesting world. The whole cloning concept and people living in a an environment where everything is controlled is quite interesting. But then everything that was set up in the beginning didn't matter any more after the first chase scene out of the complex. Though Micheal Bay does have an eye for action sequences; they were very well done.<br/><br/>But i felt that the major flaw of the movie was that it took parts of other movies and spliced them together. The whole cloning for body parts was a spin on the sixth day. the car chase with the truck was a rehash of Bay's Bad Boys II chase of the car transporter. The hover-bike had star wars - return of the jedi all over it, the sound effect was even the same.<br/><br/>though it does take a lot from other movies, this still actually stands by itself. the acting, though not great, is still solid and believable.

If you like his other films, you'll like this one too; and if you don't, sorry to disappoint you again. There are plenty of loopholes in the story, yet they managed to sustain the viewers' attention even when the film became a cat-and-mouse chase story after only forty minutes. Bay actually does a fine job to change the scenario from time to time to prevent this thing from becoming obviously boring. Still, he had to include some sequences that are indeed silly as the harsh critics keep telling.<br/><br/>Well, I'm not going to point out the plot holes or what could have been done because that will ruin the very purpose of this film. This is a film to watch in good theaters, to look at the screen wide-eyed, to mutter a few praises for the marvel of modern CGI and to have a good take on popcorn. This is not a film to think about too much. Bay ensured that. He mixed calculated amounts of everything -- sci-fi, action, comedy, sex, morals. The comedy portions need to be mentioned as they are smartly written and performed well by Steve Buscemi. The dialogues are not as cheesy as I feared. For the acting, Ewan McGregor does a nice job, especially as the creepy Tom Lincoln. Scarlett Johansson gets an easy take here after the films she's done recently.<br/><br/>That sums up everything. As a whole this movie fails to stand up as something exceptional. But a lover of Bay's style would definitely love it. I still think of ""The Rock"" as Bay's best, but this comes close. It is not a movie to throw all the bad criticism for not being something it's not supposed to be."
"Sfpsycho415","7","0","0","30 July 2005"," An entertaining sci-fi actioner, but could have been really great---7/10
","I don't care what people think of Micheal Bay. When it comes to action movies, he has made some of the very best including the Rock and Bad Boys. Sure Pearl Harbor was weak (except for the actual Pearl Harbor scene, which takes only 30% of the movie), but nobody's perfect. With the Island, i was expecting something along the lines of Minority Report meets the Rock. A movie that would blow me away with jaw-dropping action, amazing special effects and a cool story. Well, it didn't turn out just like that. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the movie, but not as much as i would have liked.<br/><br/>For one, the story didn't do much for me. It seems like the story was merely an excuse for special effects and action, instead of being part of the movie. Now, i love action, and the high speed chase in the movie was pretty damn good. But for me to really get into the action, i have to be drawn in by a good story. Also, the quick camera cuts weren't very pretty, and i am actually getting sick of every movie using them. Whatever happened to still camera?<br/><br/>Now that i got the cons out of the way, i can tell you what i liked about the movie. The underground facility at the beginning was cool, and a great intro for the movie. The whole lottery spin idea was also cool, but would have been more exciting if commercials hadn't ruined the outcome for us. Damn marketers! The performances by Ewan McGregor (quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. Go Obi!) and Scarlett Johansson (mmm...Scarlett Johansson) were very good, throwing in some class and humanity in a sort of movie where there is usually neither. And did i mention the chase scene? One of the better action scenes of the year, very intense and imaginative.<br/><br/>While this is no Matrix, the Island is a pretty entertaining summer blockbuster that has enough action, pretty faces, and eye-candy to fill your sci-fi needs until they make Equilibrium 2.---7/10"

","Of course I knew what I was getting into when I was willing to pay 10 dollars for the latest big budget Michael Bay flick; I figure there would lots of unnecessary explosions, unrealistic chase scenes and a lot of overacting.

But before I write this movie totally off I did give it a 6 for a reason, the movie had some redeeming qualities the acting wasn't that bad, Scarlett Johansson look gorgeous as usual and Her and Ewan McGregor on screen chemistry was quite enjoyable there struggle to stay alive is what kept me from walking out of the theater, and before I get to far ahead of myself I hate to say this but the story wasn't complete sh*t either Michael Bay actually attached himself to an enjoyable movie."

","Michael Bay is the big-budget Hollywood action director film critics love to hate, and although I have enjoyed most of his movies in the past, I am left here with little case to 'defend' him this time around.<br/><br/>Although, the beginning of the movie peeked my curiosity with subtle sci-fi that seemed to lead somewhere, the remainder of the movie was melodramatic, cliché and rather unoriginal. A lot of fault obviously reside with the screenplay that starts to weave a story that it is not ready to tell properly. The novelty, intrigue, subtly and humour are soon thrown out the window (like the characters).<br/><br/>Bay's fault is two-fold as he gives us little good drama or believable romance and some rather average action sequences as compared to his other much more riveting scenes in his prior movies. A car sequence is in fact a mere variation on the same theme of Bad Boy 2 - minus the healthy humour. It is true that Bay has been more apt at action than drama, but it seems here that he might have been better off picking one or the other if he was to do either correctly.<br/><br/>On the good side, the story and concept are quite interesting and the situations lead to some reflections and even a few good laughs before the halfway mark of the movie. Also, the two lead actors do a fine job and bring the viewer in with character presence and quirky idiosyncrasies. They feel real, although the 'romance' doesn't. Steve Buscemi is also his usual good support character and delivers his lines dexterously.<br/><br/>The ultimate pitfall of the movie is that the dialog and story are too black & white and try to leave you with a moral high ground acceptance with little actual effort or conviction. The story shows a gross caricature of good, evil and innocence that is certain to insult the audience on some level. It doesn't help also that the action and drama can be overly unbelievable at times and inconsistent.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Good in theory, Average in practice."

","The movie was alright. The action was about what you would expect from a Bay flick. The acting was pretty good though. Almost seemed like there wasn't enough in the budget to give the movie an authentic futuristic look and feel. For instance: The LA scenes had a few concept vehicles, and then a bunch of current and old cars mixed in. it didn't really look like it was that far in the future. Definitely not comparable to the Minority Report as far as SciFi goes, but no one said it had to be either. Ironically, they did use the Lexus from the Minority Report but it was painted blue this time.<br/><br/>Also disappointing: Bay used almost the same car chase scene from Bad Boys II, although it was much more realistic this time. It had less repetitive shots and CGI, and more realistic collisions.<br/><br/>Pacing was pretty good, and the suspense was kept up pretty well. <br/><br/>Johanssen did a great job, and she looked awesome as usual<br/><br/>McGregor also turns in a believable performance, while playing a character and a clone of a character.

","No serious spoilers here, but I do talk about the ""flow"" of the movie, which could be a spoiler if you have no idea what this movie is about.<br/><br/>We went to the ""sneak preview"" of The Island this evening. It started out as a very technically well put together version of ""Logan's Run"" (sorry; I haven't seen ""Clonus"" which is what some people say bears the strongest resemblance). It then evolved/devolved into a Schwarznegger-style blow up everything in the way/take no prisoners action flick (with a very passing resemblance to Blade Runner), and wound up a James Bond - ""How do we stop the madman ?"" -- movie. (Indeed, Sean Bean, the man who runs the evil company at the core of The Island is also the bad guy from Goldeneye.) In many ways, its a movie that couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be, and went on a bit too long.<br/><br/>All of this would have been fine, if parts 2 and 3 were vaguely believable. Incredibly, Arnold's movies are a good deal MORE believable than this, and that's saying something. After a while, you just start ""suspending your disbelief"", but you have to go SO far, that it's hard to take it at all seriously. And, I'm not talking about the SciFi concepts here, which are okay. I'm talking about the action scenes, which take on a comic-book unbelievability that's closer to a cartoon.<br/><br/>The special effects are fun to watch, and the loud soundtrack works well in a movie theater. There's a lot of closeups when people are fighting. Sometimes its hard to tell just what is going on; other times, they capture someone getting hit with a wrench, etc., so well that you wince.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, the actors -- McGregor is fine, but nothing special, Johansson is positively wooden, Buscemi is good as always, and finally, there's he treat of trying to remember who Ethan Phillips is. (a hint -- he played an alien on a very well known TV franchise). The script is all over the place, but there are some clever lines.<br/><br/>Sadly, The Island kept declining in stars as it went on -- probably 3 stars for the ""setup"" of the community in which McGregor lives, but it then rapidly fell, probably to 2 stars by the time your through wondering if it could have possibly happened like this."
"EijnarAmadeus","3","4","12","3 August 2005"," Full of energy but nothing more
","THE ISLAND is this summer's action blockbuster, at least it's supposed to be. And if there's one predictable director surfing in Hollywood it's Michael Bay. It's gonna be loud, lots of shiny and glossy features and collateral damage that makes the budget fly like a butterfly, but does it sting like a bee? Well, sometimes it does - but not always. Michael Bay often simply packs his movies with action and explosions and nothing more, making them very uninteresting, boring and seem like a Trojan horse but not with the soldiers inside. And with the huge failure of BAD BOYS 2 he simply purified this image and personality of movie making, the more cars we smash and shots that are fired, the better the movie is! And here he goes a bit psychological, not without succeeding too big, he introduces us to another kind of world where former Obi-Wan Kenobi and Lost In Translation star Scarlett lives without knowing that they're not ""real"" humans.<br/><br/>So without the big things happening in the start, we're simply introduced to a world that seems very optimistic with the health etc. Where people eat vegetables and cereal and drink water, they were white clothes and are kept in no contact of the males and females. Sean Bean stars as the boss above it all, though it seems he's got a bit too much humanity into this system - it blows up when Lincoln (McGregor) takes Jordan (Johansson) away to escape from the ""place"". So they discover the real world, were they understand that their former lives was all a lie...<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi is a actor working on both sides; on one level he's a brilliant actor that matches brilliantly into weird atmospheres and on as in Fargo and The Big Lebowski, but then again he can show up in stupid characters. As here, as in Armageddon - and here he plays a working Joe that's leaking too much information to McGregor. Out in the real world he starts helping them escape, and by a weird reason - he really doesn't fit into anything here.<br/><br/>So, Bay shooting action and excitement into THE ISLAND, it's a movie offering you the aspects of summer entertainment. Good-looking actors into a good looking movie, shining with everything from the typical in - between comedic situations and the romance. It's by no mean a triumph for nobody involved though, Michael Bay simply keeps on his wave of action movies - Ewan McGregor does a pretty okay job, but is nothing as we've seen in TRANSPOTTING and the Star Wars movies in fact, and Scarlett Johansson doesn't do much of a performance actually. It's pretty amusing to see Sean Bean again, a actor that's very underrated - Michael Clarke Duncan stars in a tiny role and Buscemi doesn't belong here. Not much fancy footwork going on in this movie, but it sure is entertainment for the money.<br/><br/>And off course; a Michael Bay movie? Hey, what can we expect? It's action and gigs blowing up."

But this film works on all levels. The performances are great, it has great dialogue, very talented cast plus the usual Michael Bay action and driving score and special effects. This movie had me on the edge of my seat just salivating at what I might see next. It starts slow, but still interesting and gripping, the middle segment is action packed and the end is well played out. There was just a little bit of having to suspend disbelief (but hell its futuristic sci/fi and cloning what do you expect). I'm no Ewan McGregor fan really either, or anyone in the cast really except for Steve Buscemi whose part is relatively small. But all of the cast were superb. Scarlett was amazing - better than in Lost in Translation even. Yes it had elements of the Matrix, but not ripping it off in any way. I'm rambling, but suffice it to say, its really really good."

Scarlett Johannsen is very good as well. The chase scenes become a bit tiresome in places but overall, this is a solid film worth seeing. There are also a few fun places with some comic relief in addition to the action and tense drama. In addition the visual effects and cinematography are spectacular! They do a wonderful job of creating a future world that is credible and quite believable. If you like Orwellian or Brave New World type themes, this one is for you!

"mr_mcculley-1","9","8","35","10 July 2005"," I hate Michael Bay, BUT LOVE THIS MOVIE
","INFO: SPOILER LEVEL 1 (first 10 minutes of film discussed) SAW IT AT: Saturday Preview Screening at Jersey Gardens, NJ<br/><br/>""The Island"" is entertaining, thought-provoking, and thrilling. It also made me do something I never thought possible--put ""Michael Bay"" and ""intelligent film-making"" in the same sentence. My previous experience with director Michael Bay has been that his films are either dumb fun (The Rock) or so dumb they cause suffering (Pearl Harbor, Armageddon). But it's amazing how good a film can be when you plug Mr. Bay's talent for staging action together with a thoughtful script. The result is one of the best sci-fi action movies of all time and likely the best of this decade.<br/><br/>Michael Bay did not make this transformation into intelligent action director by himself. He traded his usual producer, Jerry Bruckheimer (whose last name in German means ""lowest common denominator""), to some guy named Spielberg. He traded cheese ball Nicholas Cage for serious thespians Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johannsen. And lastly, the script comes from the new Dreamworks dynamic duo of screenwriters Alex Kurtzman & Roberto Orci.<br/><br/>All of these trades are for the better. The script starts slowly as watch the daily routines of a strange Utopian facility that prepares citizens for their trip to the mystical ""ISLAND"". When they are chosen to go to THE ISLAND, they will get the chance to create a new society like Adam & Eve starting over. All looks happy and bright but citizen Ewan MacGregor is feeling restless and shares his concerns with his best friend Scarlett Johannsen. Facility administrator Sean Bean seems deeply puzzled by MacGregor's misgivings. From this quiet start, the screenplay takes some dramatic turns all leading to some serious white-knuckle action scenes.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic across the board. The production design is flawless, presenting a near future that mixes just the right amount of present-day with non-existing technologies to feel both familiar and enchanting. The action is some of the best that Michael Bay has directed and has the added benefit of true emotional resonance. When a bad guy smacks into something or our heroes reach victory, the audience was cheering, laughing, and I heard ""Holy ****"" exclaimed several times all around me. To top it all of, it's exceptionally funny. The laughs come naturally within the events of the movie (usually from Steve Buscemi), not with silly wisecracks or tacked on punchlines (again, HOORAY FOR NO NICHOLAS CAGE!).<br/><br/>The past few summers have also had future action films (I, Robot, Minority Report), but none have hit on all cylinders like The Island. I, Robot had decent action with undercooked characters (grumpy Will Smith and a screen saver). Conversely, Minority Report had solid acting but was utterly pointless (Steve's brilliant moral--Kids, do not base law enforcement around psychics). The Island actually has something compelling and relevant to say about today's top medical controversy.<br/><br/>In summation, go see it! This deserves to be the biggest hit of the summer (and I like Batman Begins an awful lot). It is the most fun I have had in the theaters since the original Matrix. The only reason it does not get a 10 is because it contains some overzealous product placement. Don't buy the products, but buy your Island tickets if you want an explosive double does of adrenaline and brains."
"tieman64","Null","3","9","27 November 2012"," masterpiece cinema but also the explosions not as good as Michael play explosions in masterpiece like bad boys and transfarmers
","Michael Bay is number one top guy and I love him very much but I get nervous before seeing The Island because man in Swedish newspaper say it not very good film. Luckily Michael Bay never disappoint and me and friend Sven rewarded for faith. You see, The Island is more masterpiece cinema from king of masterpiece action cinema Michael Bay. Don't get me wrong. The Island is not as good as Michael Bay masterpiece auteur cinema epics like Bad Boys and Transfarmers, but it is still gold standard action cinema from the maestro delivered with one two KO knockout punch.<br/><br/>Now while The Island is certain movie to hit ball out of park, there are some negative aspects which make it not so masterpieceful as Michael Bay masterpiece classics like Transfarmers and Bad Boys. Some people like my friend Sven say The Rock was masterpiece classic cinema too, well that is true slice of fact Sven, but I don't mention it with Transfarmers and Bad Boys in classic list above to save space.<br/><br/>So anyway, what about The Island? Well, sad to say, it has some problems stopping it from being top level classic action masterpiece cinema auteur knockout like Transformers and Bad Boys, which as you know is number one top dog films in Swedish industry via landslide. First of all Michael Bay chose an actor who is not American and is from foreign. No big deal? Well, compare to other Michael Bay actor classic heroes and blacks, it is somewhat wrong error in judgement call selection choice. Also the movie star actress Bay chose is sexy mammal but lets be honest you cannot bang her because she is not real, so why put her in action cinema scenes and not focus instead on classic stunts and movie magic and true blockbuster glory? <br/><br/>But don't worry. If there is one thing master Bay knows how to do when delivering gold standard classic one two knockout punch auteur cinema masterpieces, it is how to construct believable action knockout moments with deep and good feelings that stand the test of time. That is why I firmly believe The Island will go down in history as moment in time when we finally woke up to true calling of Michael Bay. And that is to deliver masterpiece classics which rock our world and blow our minds with true auteur style and moments, like when The Island has scenes with helicopters and well, I don't want to spoil it for you. Just remember to leave your brain at the door, but then bring it back inside, because as my friend Sven say, this action cinema is only true classic masterpieces from the maestro unless you bring your brain in and understand the true journey plot. <br/><br/>And that is why Michael Bay will always be the best. He knows what judgement calls and selections to make with storyboards and film grammar and when he edits he is making statements. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying Michael play is the best, even though he is probably the best on many critic lists about true action classic cinema auteur genius constructors, but I am saying if you really want to rock your world then Bay is your number one man to deliver the goods time and time again with A plus results. And when I say ""man"", lol, I don't mean that for literal. Because Michael Bay is a god. A god of true action classic auteur one two knockout punch cinema movie pictures.<br/><br/>10/10 - Masterpiece classic action cinema auteur top ten list."

Though the film greatly touches on the negative aspects of cloning, it also somehow almost justifies it.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson pull off their roles as clones perfectly. Their roles, which require them to act almost like innocent children, yet behave like adults, create an unfathomable connection with the audience. When watching this movie, I cannot help but think back to the days of my childhood, back when my mind was simple and curious, and not corrupted by society like I shamefully admit today.<br/><br/>Scarlet Johansson's character Jordan is the perfect woman in my eye. I would also assume that many women today would consider Ewan McGregor's character Lincoln the perfect man. For you religious nuts out there, these two can be compared to Adam and Eve, as they both are innocent, beautiful, and very curious.<br/><br/>Though I assume most of you already know the basic plot, as the previews show quite a bit, I will still cut myself short, as I do not want to give anything away. Let's just say that few movies have ever given me as much joy as this one. I actually caught myself grinning during a few of the scenes, not from amusement, but from amazement."
"Colville_Kitz","8","3","9","15 July 2005"," A Change of Pace for Bay (sort of...)
","I will readily admit that I rarely leave Micheal Bay movies thinking, ""huh..."" so it was with a mix of apprehension and excitement that I left ""The Island"" with just that thought. The movie follows the lives of Lincoln (remember the name) Six Echo and Jordon Two Delta, played with a startling innocence and focus by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson respectively. The two live with thousands of other survivors in a post-apocalyptic world after the earth was ""contaminated"". Or so they think. What transpires is that Lincoln Six Echo, always the feisty one, discovers the terrible secret behind their existence. There was no mass extinction! The Island is just a way to pacify the masses whose true purpose is to act as organ donors for their wealthy owners. And so the two (whose sexual tension has come to a boil by this point) escape. Needless to say this poses a notable problem for the company's creator Merrick, played by the always sinister Sean Bean, who is already breaking a number of laws by allowing his clones to gain consciousness. So French mercenaries (French only to cover up Djimon Hounsou's accent) are brought in to kill our sexy duo. Cue massive explosions and the same old Bay car chase in which people drive very quickly down a busy highway while huge objects are dumped off the back of a big rig (if you're curious what it looks like, just go to the scene in ""Bad Boys II""). Of course the action in ""The Island"" is cleaner and frankly more exciting because you don't feel like you're getting dumber as every second ticks by, a feeling I can seem to shake while watching Martin Lawrence scream as he hurtles down a Miami interstate. But what makes The Island truly a pleasant surprise is that's it's actually a smart movie. Not Adaptation smart, but let's be honest, in a time when the bar for clone movies is already pretty low (see the laughable Godsend as evidence) The Island does an excellent job of looking at the various angles to the quagmire of human cloning. Merrick, while obviously ""evil"" still has some good points. When Johansson escapes we are reminded that while we should root for her to gain her freedom, her freedom will come at the price of a mother's life. There are obviously some serious upsides to cloning and I tip my hat to Bay for exploring this. But what's most interesting about the film is the analogy to the slave trade. These clones are treated as property and constantly referred to as ""product"". They are given new names and pipe dream hopes in order to pacify them (The Island, read: the Motherland/freedom...) So it doesn't take an American History buff to see how clever a Lincoln character (actually named Lincoln) is to free these clones. It is the very virtue of these levels which makes The Island such a summer winner. It's not exactly a seamless mix of heady morality and blowing stuff up, but it's close. As close as you should expect to see in a Micheal Bay movie. So if you can go in thinking ""Armageddon"" and you might well come out thinking, ""huh..."""

","I saw this movie at a sneak preview expecting another throwaway action flick from Michael Bay, with more attention to giant explosions than to characters or plot.. I can gladly say that I was dead wrong! This movie is genuinely entertaining, with comedic moments that are truly funny (not the usual cheesy one-liners) and the movie is beautifully shot. A lot of time is devoted to the story (which happens to be very interesting) and the action scenes revolve around the plot for once (not the other way around). The futuristic aspects of the movie are beautiful and look awesome, while still being believable.<br/><br/>Also, the cast is one of the best I've seen in a while. Ewan Mcgregor is fascinating to watch as he plays dual roles. He captures the innocent child-like curiosity of Lincoln and the ruthlessness of rich bastard Tom with equal believability and his comedic timing is perfect. Scarlett Johansson is also great and kicks ass while looking gorgeous and she and Ewan have wonderful on-screen chemistry. The supporting cast is also fabulous with Steve Buscemi as an ally and Sean Bean as a perfect villain. Djimon Hounsou brings a lot of weight to his character and Michael Clarke Duncan is brilliant in a small but important role.<br/><br/>The movie also has a great score which fits perfectly, and the action scenes are great without being over the top.<br/><br/>In all, it's a great movie and I can't wait until July 22nd for it to come out so I can see it again!"

The clones are used for harvesting their organs, you don't need them running around in their own little world. No explanation why Echo is getting his originals thoughts. If Johannsen's character is a world recognized model, why does no why recognize her (the clone) ?? This is just the tip of the iceberg of plot holes."

Bay's Armageddon produced cringes, I'm sure.<br/><br/>This at least attempts to compose the references to other genre movies.<br/><br/>But it's all junk food, all the bacon stripped of the protein and nutrients, leaving us with the fatty bits.<br/><br/>Just take chunks of THX1138, Matrix Reloaded, Freejack, the 6th Day, etc., add some Jungian musings, mix it into the writing pot, roll cameras and cross the fingers. Stopping at the first false ending might have saved it.<br/><br/>Most annoying is the moralizing...the evil doctor explains away his modus operandi, the hunter explains his change of heart...Bay cannot conceive of visual storytelling, there's no vocabulary here but the most infantile of burbles.<br/><br/>The only bits of (minor) cinematic interest are the pans of the future LA skyline."

It's almost time for me to give up totally on Michael Bay, who used to be reliable in this particular sub-genre of cheese.<br/><br/>He even managed to mangle a love scene between Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johansson, two actors who are nothing if not sexy. And yet- when push came to shove- it was acted and shot with all the uptight teasing angles of an old episode of ""Love, American Style"". What a waste.<br/><br/>There were a few bright spots. Steve Buschemi, of course, stole every scene he was in.<br/><br/>My advice- if it's on TV, watch the first ten minutes or so, then go do your laundry.

However,in the case of The Island,the story comes first(yes,there is some great action on the way,but the subject happens to be more intriguing).<br/><br/>The movie is set in 2019(same year as Blade Runner),in a utopian facility where thousands of people,who have survived the ""great contamination"",wait to win the lottery so they can go to the Island,the last remaining paradise on the planet. That is,until Lincoln Six Echo(Ewan Mcgregor)and Jordan Two Delta(Scarlett Johansson)escape after discovering the awful truth: they're all clones and when they win the lottery,it means their ""sponsors"" need new organs or something. This is where the fun begins,as Dr.Merrick(Sean Bean)hires Albert Laurent(Djimon Honsou)and his team to catch the two fugitives.<br/><br/>Michael Bay tackles the subject (cloning: should we or shouldn't we?)so that the film's never boring,while inserting his trademark action sequences to prove he still can do what Jerry Bruckheimer made him famous for.<br/><br/>Not as great as other sci-fi flicks,but still enjoyable.<br/><br/>As for the actors,Sean Bean does his usual job well,while Scarlett Johansson has done better.Mcgregor is quite good actually,particularly in the hilarious scenes between Lincoln and his Scottish ""sponsor"".

Of course, I saw the movie. Did anyone notice that it has some similarities to 'The Sixth day'. Anyway, the story goes something like this. People have new insurance policies in future. Clones.

You get the baby.<br/><br/>Phew...I was laughing like hell, in the theater. SO were my friends. THIS MOVIE IS SO RIDICULOUS....I even despised Scarlett in this movie. And I heard she wanted to do a topless scene. That 'would' have been the only think that I would have liked. Ewan McGregor!! Renton was the only character he played that I liked.<br/><br/>AND WHAT THE HECK IS Djimon Hounsou doing in this movie. Is he a bad guy or a good guy??!!!

I came out the cinema a few hours later, shell shocked and in love with another movie.<br/><br/>The storyline is complex yet simple and believable, especially the year it's set in...it's the future without it being too futuristic. I'm not normally a fan of sci-fi but there was something about this, some innate humanity and raw emotion that drew me in. The acting is star, the effects are stunning and the plot is very exciting. I love how you didn't really know what was going on for a lot of the film, that sense of mystery just keeps you going, wanting more, and when you find out what really is going on, it's not what you expected. McGregor, Johanssen, Bean and Buscemi (to name a few of the fantastic actors in this) are all astounding, I admire their skills.<br/><br/>Go and see this film just because.

The plot is excellent and the action was seat gripping. The entire movie did not have one boring moment it was complete entertainment beginning to end, The high speed chases and the characters journey to discover who they are and where they came from was very exciting. The fact that the government was involved was interesting because it seems like something that would really happen and our government trying to hide the fact of what really goes on. The futuristic scenes were perfect, it really gave a clue as to what the real future looks like, not flying cars and robots but the ""real"" future. The ending was perfect, an awesome resolution to the uncivilized way the people were being treated."

","This movie had me and my wife from the beginning. First I must say that some of these people giving this movie a poor review are the ones that gave war of the worlds a great review. War of the worlds was a slow paced, jumbled mess that made no sense, but that didn't stop it from making 175 million dollars. How is that possible? The Island on the other hand had brilliant sets amazing actions scenes and every bit of it was believable. This movie is entertaining and paced excellently. The action scenes as well as the ""emotional scenes"" are done well and hold your attention and spark your emotions.(my wife cried at parts and I found my self at tense moments griping the arm rest) And for those who have said there are holes, they were not paying attention or they are just not smart enough! Every thing is explained in the movie. After watching this movie you will see it is in fact original. Sure there have been other movies about cloning and people being on the run, but there have been many movies about Aliens invading from space and people on the run, come to think of it Tom Cruse was on the run the entire war of the War of the Worlds but no one seemed to be bothered by that. People are not being fair here. Go see this movie and judge for your self. I for one will be adding this to my DVD collection as this is one of the best SCI Fi movies in years. It has every right to be a summer block buster."

","Ever wonder what it would be like to be a clone? Not an easy get. There's really nothing similar in everyday life. The possibility is explored in such a skillful way in this wonderful movie that Michael Bay, the director, is now up there with Ridley Scott and James Cameron in my book, though that sketch is just one of many achievements here. True, there are a few misses, but you will forgive them unless you're even tighter with your praise than you are with your money. There are just too many chances taken successfully to not be thoroughly impressed. The overwhelming effect is one of real mastery and vision.<br/><br/>All the leads are in top form. As a guy you're almost swept away by Scarlett Johansson who can command our attention at will it seems. And though the plot is a little over the top, it's expressed with such flair and energy that it doesn't really matter. No, I'm really sorry I didn't see this movie the minute it came out, and it's clearly a good move to see it on the big screen. (It puzzles me why women liked it better than men in the rating demographics. There's a lot of extremely well done action in this movie.)"

","This movie was incredible! The story was compelling, the action was riveting, and the sci-fi was done very well. The action immersed you in the movie, making you cringe when things went wrong, and excited when the incredible happened. You felt like part of that world. There are many scenes (which I will not discuss) where you hold your breath and you have to remind yourself to breathe. It was well done. But for how well the action was, it did not detract from the storyline. It complimented it. You can walk away from this movie and have an intelligent conversation about the dilemmas the film presented. That is the beauty of sci-fi; it provides a forum for current issues without offending anyone. I *highly* recommend this film. You will not be disappointed. In fact I think I'm ready to see it again."
"nscoppo","10","2","5","25 July 2005"," More People Need to see This
","I don't truly understand why the fans of action movies are not filling the theaters to see The Island. It stars two of the better actors/actresses of our time in Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlette Johanssen and gives us an amount of action that can make most fans smile. At the same time the story line is actively involving yet not complicated in any sense of the imagination. Michael Bay finally came through in his greatest movie to date yet this movie only pulled in 12 million dollars on it's opening weekend. It is a disgrace to see such movies as Wedding Crashers outperform the Island this past weekend. That tells me that people are more interested in watching two horny full grown men invade a wedding to get some over a movie where there is a great story with depth involved. <br/><br/>I would talk about the movie and some of the amazing sequences but to do that would ruin the movie for many viewers. Just know that the movie is set in the future and the technological advancements the movie shows us are outstanding. The special effects are top of the line as most Michael Bay movies seem to be. It seems to me that The Island is either going to completely bomb at the box office (which it shouldn't) or will become a hit because of word of mouth. <br/><br/>What will surprise most people if they take the time to see this movie is it does not completely revolve around gigantic explosions or sex. Instead this movie focuses on the life of two people and their fight for survival in a world that we would not even be able to comprehend if we had to experience it ourselves. All I am saying is look at the bulk of the reviews for this movie. Most people have given it a rating of seven or higher meaning it is a very good movie to say the very least. If you spend eighteen dollars to see this movie with your significant other you will not feel like you were cheated out of your money. Instead when you leave you will wonder what it would be like to live in a world that these two people have to experience."
"blackorient","8","2","5","25 July 2005"," This movie is more than an island of questions.
","For once, I was glad that I randomly picked a movie at the spur of the moment.<br/><br/>I was at the cinema with one of my best friends and three other Chinese friends. The task of picking a movie was assigned to me. But seeing that I haven't been catching up with movies listing for nearly 6 weeks, I found it a tough job. Summer really was deprived of attention-grabbing movie titles. My Chinese friends were turned off by the title of this flick itself, The Island. I mean, seriously, who would want to watch a movie called 'The Island', especially when they have no idea what is it all about in the first place? If it wasn't for the brief printed summary at the counter, I would not have given this movie a second glance. Like War of The Worlds, its poster was not self-explanatory. Plus, I did not watch the trailer prior to my trip to the cinema.<br/><br/>BUT, unlike War of The Worlds (or any other movies before this), for once I did not question the logic of the flow of the storyline. The storyline was good enough for me to not stop focusing and start being a cynic. At the very least, questions that the average viewer might ask about the plot are answered. It was 100% NOT boring and the plot holes in this movie was subtle because of the relatively fast pace of the story growth. In fact, though I had only watched it once, I don't remember any noticeable loop holes in the storyline. Or questionable action scenes for that matter. I didn't cared if there were futuristic technologies in the movie. After all, the whole thing took place in the future. It was nice that it blended in with the contemporary definitions of the current world, all so that everything seemed viably realistic.<br/><br/>Now, there is humor here and there, blended in nicely with action and drama. Noticeable humor genres are satire, sarcasm and banter. The director, Micheal Bay, cleverly played with ""human"" innocence in the movie. The whole innocence thing somehow reminded me of how complex our minds have made today to be. How open the minds of those ""humans"" are to different ideas, compared to many of us in reality. Lincoln Six Echo questioned, and that was what made the difference. That manner reminded me of Dead Poets Society, another good movie.<br/><br/>Needless to say, Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson complemented each other well. This is the first time I watched Johansson in action, and I must say, her character development as Jordan Two Delta was good. It was more noticeable than McGregor's part. Lincoln Six Echo was depicted as a skeptic to start with, whereas Jordan Two Delta was very innocent. On the other hand, I was quite surprised that McGregor took up this role as I was quite brainwashed with his role as Obi Wan Kenobi in Star Wars and Catcher Block in Down With Love. After all, Lincoln Six Echo is more of a character of innocence, curiosity, and mischief, just like a confused child. Nevertheless, it was a refreshing brilliant performance of McGregor.<br/><br/>If I were to complain about anything at all, it would be that I didn't manage to buy popcorn because of the long line at the food counter. I don't think people who are just looking for entertainment with depth would complain about this movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I definitely want to watch this again."
"GreenwheelFan2002","9","2","5","24 July 2005"," Not just about action, but about survival...
","Once again the critics prove themselves as morons! This movie was definitely the best I've seen this summer and deserves a lot more recognition than it is getting. People see the name Michael Bay and instantly think of a sappy action movie not worth the time, but trust me, this one is definitely worth your time and money.<br/><br/>I won't comment on specifics of the story because I don't want to spoil it, but as a whole it is very impressive, and tackles many issues that we face in today's society.<br/><br/>The acting is great, and Ewan McGregor pulled off his character perfectly. The innocence and wonder that he expresses as Lincoln 6 Echo was the best I've seen from him.<br/><br/>I'll admit that the first half of the movie is better than the 2nd half, and the many chase scenes can get frustrating, but the action adds a lot to the movie, and the directing is wonderful.<br/><br/>But the one point that this movie tackled which makes it noteworthy is the characterization. I really cared for the two lead characters and wanted to see them succeed in their goal, which is rare in most action films. I even enjoyed seeing the minor characters through the movie, so much that I cared about their outcomes. Not to mention that they are believable. The main character in this film isn't some invulnerable super action hero, he is frail and inexperienced when it comes to fighting. There weren't any moments that I thought he was going out of his capabilities. The characters are confused and weak, and they are depicted wonderfully.<br/><br/>Come on people, stop obsessing over the frat comedies, crappy comic-book adaptations, and dumb horror movies, and treat yourself to a good film. Don't pass this one up. GO AND SEE IT NOW!"

","The Island marks Michael Bay's sixth foray into studio cinema, and in my humble opinion, his most successful yet. Let's take a look into the Bay catalog, his name is synonomous with big budget eye candy, fast cuts, and sugar candy stories. Bad Boys, all right, nothing spectacular, The Rock, a great action flick, Armageddon blah (a guilty pleasure I admit), Pearl Harbor I didn't hate as much as the rest of the world but again it was lacking heart.<br/><br/>Now, to The Island. Imagine if you've got a lot of money, and would like to live forever. The solution is as simple as a few million dollars. A clone of yourself, at your age is created, and installed into a controlled facility, where they are under complete control, educated to the age of about a fifteen year old. The clones are told that there was a contamination on the earth, and that the island is the only pure, uncontaminated spot on the Earth. So they wait in this special facility till they win the ""lottery,"" and are transported to the island. Back in the real world, your liver starts to kick the bed? Your clone then wins the lottery, where in reality, your organ is harvested, the clone killed.<br/><br/>Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) stumbles upon the truth, and along with Jordan Two-Delta, are on the run, pursued by Laurent (Djimon Hounsou). Bay has the right ingredients here, great actors, a great premise, all mixed in with his flashy eye candy.<br/><br/>The only cons? Wall to wall product placement, but once your past that, it's a great ride."

","This is not a deep movie. It doesn't have knife-edge dialog, it doesn't make you think, it doesn't require lining up more than three brain cells at a time. It is, instead, a pretty and fast-paced action flick.<br/><br/>First, let's do looks. It is pretty. There is good use of color (or lack thereof), there are a few very eye-catching shots (some chase scenes at the beginning and a track following a pipeline, for example). I liked how they portrayed the future: incredible technology does exist, but it's not everywhere - there are run-down bars and trashy cars among all the chrome and gigabytes, just like in real life.<br/><br/>The story itself is very simple. Clones escape from their institution and try to reveal their story to the world. Insert hour-long chase scenes and disposable bad guys. For some reason, SEALS are a dime a dozen and can easily be killed by clones who are supposed to have a fifteen-year-old's mentality. And you know what? We don't care. We're just here for the explosions.<br/><br/>There are a few memorable scenes, and some that reminded me of other movies - the Matrix and Minority Report are the best two examples, bringing on strong senses of Deja Vu. Also, it was nice to see Boromir and Obi-Wan again.<br/><br/>It's not supposed to be brilliant, and it's not.

It totally ROCKED! Very fun, very exciting, smart, funny, thrilling...it did everything it set out to. Sure, the lighting was odd here and there, and there were lots of shaky camera/fast-cut scenes (and other sub-par trademark qualities of a typical Michael Bay film), but damn...this was just fine. Ewan McGregor, whom I've always liked, acted better than ever, and Scarlett Johansen was just wonderful (but of course!). Djimon Hounsou once again proves to be one of the leading most underrated actors - he's simply amazing. Sean Bean was great, too, but he really needs to have a starring role sometime.

","The Island is the newest action movie from director Michael Bay, the guy who made Pearl Harbour and The Rock. This time he tackles a utopian community where one by one people are sent to ""The Island"" a place where free from contamination, which seems to have engulfed the world. Lincoln Six Echo however begins to question life in the colony and soon discovers that there is more to the Island than it seems.<br/><br/>Well generally films by Bay are high on action but does poorly in terms of the screenplay. Well for this one there was still a lot of action especially in the second half of the film. However the screenplay has improved for this one. The screenplay on this one is actually pretty smart even if the concept was unoriginal given the track record of Bay.<br/><br/>I thought the acting of the main characters was sufficient enough. Ewan McGregor did a good enough of a job. He did a good job in some of the lighter moments of the film. Scarlett Johansson who was great in Lost in Translation does not shine in this one as basically her role takes a back seat to McGregor's character. Sean Bean as usual performed well as the bad guy.<br/><br/>One thing I was rather disturbed about was the rather blatant ""product placement"" in the film. It was like they were shoving the brands down your throat instead of it placing it more subtly in the background.<br/><br/>Also some of the other actors who were given top billing I thought were under utilized in this movie.

Don't look for a new twist on the old stories though because you won't find it...the level of ""homage"" being payed here is pretty extreme. The action sequences are some of the best I've seen in recent films, though they are chocker-block full of Bay's trademarks. This film is definitely made for mass consumption, but,if Michael Bay's packaging of the older ideas will bring them to a general public who would not otherwise experience them...well...then I guess that's alright.

Genrated by a company they discover their clones and the purpose of their existence after winning the supposedly random lottery to go to the last remaining paradise the Island. But they soon discover there is no island and the reason for living is because they're being sponsored by rich people so that after their body parts have outlived their usefulness they can replace them with theirs. Slightly disturbing I know. They soon end up on the run and thats when the Michael Bay kicks in. With one exciting action set piece after another. Filling the film witch subtle and seemingly realistic special effects the film keeps you grounded in emotion and hanging on to the edge of your seat. Besides the films undeniable contents it sports memorable performances from its cast, Michael Bays best direction, a spectacular score and colorful cinematographic.

It was AMAZING - I knew it would be good but i didn't know it would be THAT good. The ending was a little cheesy, just the whole scene with everyone walking and looking around in the desert (it was in the previews!). It is a very very original plot, and there's a lot more to it than just the basic plot that they tell you in the previews. It is a super-duper action packed movie, including a highway scene that made the matrix's highway scene look like child's play. I can't wait to see it again - I gotta wait 'till the 22nd! The theater was packed where we went, and we had to sit in the second to front row. You could tell everyone loved it, and when we came out of the theater we felt like we could run for miles just because of the energy we had.

I wish to say the same about Micheal Bay's latest action flick, The Island, but it was more of a disappointment. <br/><br/>The action was as usual brilliantly coordinated, especially the fast car chase and the crashes. Even though it lasted for only 15 minutes, it is totally worth the $10. Apart from that, the movie was moving at a slow, very slow pace.

"rlf_sunflower66","9","2","6","25 July 2005"," ""The Island"" is this summer's must-see sci-fi action movie
","Once I saw the online previews, I knew I had to see ""The Island"". Like other must-see sci favorites such as ""Minority Report"" and the ""Matrix"" movies, ""The Island"" contains several essential elements: 1) a controversial theme that provokes viewers to think and to ask questions; 2) actors and actresses who carry their roles so well that you almost forget who they are aside from the movie; 3) directing that takes you through the story and characters' perspectives from start to finish; 4) action sequences and high-speed chases; 5) some romance and subtle humor; and 6) an icy villain.<br/><br/>The selection and performances of the cast make it difficult to choose just one or two actors to talk about (everyone is exceptional in this movie!), but I'll focus on Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean. McGregor's dual-role performance as Lincoln Six-Echo and Tom Lincoln provides ""stay-in-your-seat"" moments, and Bean doesn't spare the ice as Dr. Merrick (now on my ""favorite villain"" list along with Agent Smith of ""Matrix"" fame).<br/><br/>Everything else--the story, the high-speed action, the unanswered questions, the subtle (and not-so-subtle) humor and irony, and the romantic subplot--make ""The Island"" this summer's must-see sci-fi action movie. Both ""The Island"" and ""Minority Report"" contain the deus-ex-machina device in several scenes, and ""The Island"" has lots of surprise elements (must see to believe!) Director Michael Bay has done it again with a movie that people will be talking about even after it is available on VHS/DVD."
"SILENCEikillyou","10","2","6","25 July 2005"," Great acting, great direction, great story
","I really liked this film. First a comment on the acting: Ewen McGregor - SO nice to see he won't get type-cast, since he does many different films. He's a great actor and shows at least 2 sides of his wide spectrum of character. He didn't seem to have one awkward acting moment in this movie. He helped make it great.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansen - She has really blossomed and bloomed (or whatever) into a beautiful and talented and enjoyable actress with more depth than you might, at first, imagine. She was able to aptly harness the traits of someone who's both naive and savvy at the same time. Plus she's gorgeous and her facial expressions say it all.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi - Yet another fine performance, Steve! You never disappoint.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou - Stepping out of his 'normal' roles nicely. First began to see it in Constantine and it's nice to see him in a role that doesn't necessarily HAVE to call for an African. He's a great talented actor and well deserves this role variation. He's more than paid his dues to Hollywood. Not that he shouldn't do roles that call for a strong 'guide'-type role in Africa, as well.<br/><br/>Sean Bean - Did a great job in this film too. Like Hounsou, he seems to do a fine job in every movie he's in. It'd be nice to see him do a different type of character. Nonetheless, was perfect for the role he played in this movie.<br/><br/>Direction: The scenes and camera angles shot for a particular emotion was covered very professionally. The acting talent was expertly enhanced by really good direction in this film. I have scenes that I didn't like in this film (albeit some were very unbelievable, but in an enjoyable way).<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!! The scene falling from that building, riding a large sign (letter 'R') was very far-fetched by very thrilling. However, the ""Jesus really loves you!"" comment was extremely hilarious.<br/><br/>I also loved the scene where Scarlett Johansen was watching her 'sponsor' on that commercial for Calvin Klein and watching 'herself' kissing someone, having never experienced that for herself. Then the way she touched her own lips. It was a very special moment in that film."
"candy_flesh","10","2","6","24 July 2005"," Best action/sci fi movie I've seen in two years
","Despite the critical bashing it's received from reviewers and friend, I figured we'd give it a fair shake anyhow, since the IMDb rated it above our other option for the afternoon, the remake of Bad News Bears. <br/><br/>Oh. My. <br/><br/>When we came out of it, my husband & I pretty much looked at each other and said ""What the h*ll is everyone complaining about? That movie rocked!""<br/><br/>We seriously loved it. Both of us agree that it's the best action movie we've seen all year. Maybe in two years. It was fantastic! The story was actually based on a premise we find plausible, the acting was good, the stars are gorgeous. Steve Buscemi was great, of course. There were funny moments without overplaying the jokes. There were some silly action sequences, but you know what? If I am having a good time, I am willing to believe that someone could fall 70 stories holding on to a piece of scaffolding, and somehow get caught in a net and not be injured. There was never a point where there were so many bullets flying around it was ridiculous that they hadn't been shot. No one flew through the air in slow motion. Sure, there was cheesy dialogue, but I don't go to a movie like this for the script, that's what Cameron Crowe movies are for. <br/><br/>Also, the female lead was not a) too tough to be believed or b) all bimboed up with mass cleavage and tiny skirts. She was modestly dressed the whole time, and was competent without being over the top action hero girl. There was one sex scene, it fit with the plot, and was tastefully filmed. <br/><br/>Seriously, I wish I understood why people don't like it. I thought it was bloody terrific. I've been in a good mood all day just because I had such a great time at the movies!<br/><br/>I give it two paws up."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The comparisons to ""Logan's Run"" are inevitable and there are many familiarities with ""Minority Report"", ""Coma"", ""Total Recall"" and even the remake of ""Invasions of the Body Snatchers"". Of course, these are expected when one combines sci-fi with a future world and cloning! Director Michael Bay must have been quite the terror as a boy growing up. I envision young Mikey trying to blow things up and perform stunts on his bike after attaching the motor from the lawn mower. Now that he is big and rich, he gets to do it for real in EVERY one of his movies (""Bad Boys"", ""The Rock"" ""Armageddon"" ""Pearl Harbor""). I will say he is very consistent.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is a bit of stretch for Bay and I don't believe he quite pulls it off. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson couldn't possibly be any more photogenic and gosh, they sure can RUN. Haven't seen this much running in a movie since the Steve Prefontaine story. The supporting cast is stellar with Sean Bean pulling off one his patented bad guy smoothies, Djimon Hounsou (""In America"" ""Gladiator"") is underutilized as a renegade bounty hunter, Michael Clarke Duncan (""The Green Mile"") has one terrific scene and the great Steve Buscemi is a wonderfully quirky addition. Despite all the star power and fire power, the film leaves us feeling a bit flat.<br/><br/>The best scenes are with McGregor when his clone and owner together - whether in an ultra cool house or a very fast caddy. The worst scenes are the car/copter/motorcycle chases which look just like the Bad Boys stuff.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is eye candy for those who aren't really concerned about the details in a story - quite a few of which are left hanging here."

The 'revelations' of the plot made me laugh out loud (frankly anyone expecting anything more than Perry Mason's endings should go see something else). The direction is annoying whenever it doesn't look like TV (which is not too often). The acting is so bad it made me ashamed for poor Scarlett Johansson who really doesn't deserve to be surrounded by so many crappy actors. McGregor is his usual self... a mellow hunk for teenagers who tries to look like he's a bad boy... pathetic! The only good things about this movie, you can get by reading about 500 books and seeing another dozen of movies... it had echoes of Brave New World, Logan's Run, The Matrix and just about everything else in the same vein that the writing team could throw in for good measure. It's action, sure, but not very good action and the ending is so lame it will remind you of other worlds like Little House where the rain always stop before the end.<br/><br/>Studio plants say you should go see this movie because it has action, love, actors, a plot, more action and also... it's the greatest film ever... 25% of 10? yeah right! well...

"goofnut569","8","2","6","22 July 2005"," Fast, Futuristic, and Fun
","Michael Bay has a history of making high quality action films with a good solid plot an underlying love story. This movie delivers. Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlet Johansson play two people who live in a seemingly perfect place and who long to win the mysterious lottery. Those who win the lottery get to go to 'The Island' which is the last place on Earth that was not affected by the great contamination many years ago. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan Mcgregor) starts to question his existence and that of his fellows in this seemingly perfect world, and uncovers the chilling truth. They are all clones who are used as insurance policies for the rich who are willing to pay the price to cheat death. This discovery leads him to take action which involves lots of running and explosions. All of the action and chase sequences were fast paced but never typical. Superb cinematography and a riveting score help keep these scenes from being just another action flick. Michael Bay satisfies his fetish for crushing cars and urban destruction stylishly in a futuristic Los Angeles setting. The underlying love story was more innocent and light-hearted that that of his past films. The reason this film did not rank a perfect ten was because of it's inconsistencies in the setting. It just wasn't as believable as I was hoping. The cars all looked and sounded the same as they do today and all of the women were cookie cutter super models. It simply didn't take itself seriously in all aspects. All of that aside it was well acted, well scripted and was a lot of fun to watch. I would recommend it to anyone in for a good adrenaline rush without the monotony and goofy jokes of this summer's Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The story was solid and the acting was great...definitely one of this summer's must see films."

I hope the Philip K Dick foundation or his heirs are getting paid for this blatant plagiarism and copy write infringement called ""The Island."" The only difference is that in the Philip K Dick novel it was world war that had laid waste to the land not a biological catastrophe. Yes, the leaders of this society were harvesting organs to prolong their life. Yes, there was one person who discovered this and took action.

"KBall217","10","6","30","9 July 2005"," What you'd expect from Michael Bay....in a good way
","I just got home from a sneak preview of The Island, Michael Bay's latest summer Blockbuster and first movie without producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Set in the near future (2019), The Island is about a utopian society which lives with the sole purpose of being chosen to go to 'The Island', the only perfect place left in an otherwise completely contaminated world. Or so the society's inhabitants believe... Overall I would have to say that I was pleased with the movie, however it was somewhat predictable and seemed to take a bit from George Lucas' THX1138 and a sequence from Bad Boys II. There is also a sequence that reminded me of a particular Star Wars film. You will know which ones I am talking about. Now I have to say that I am biased in the fact that I love summer blockbusters. I find them as a guilty pleasure, and this one was no different. Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean delivered excellent performances (as they usually do), and Scarlett Johansson is magnificent eye candy (she was great too, don't get me wrong). I don't want to give away too much, but I will say that if you've enjoyed Micheal Bay's previous films, you will not be disappointed with this one...even without Mr. Bruckheimer."

Some of the dialog was also overly simplistic. I'm not talking about from the clones. But the ""normal people"" had too much cliched dialog.

And then I saw Scarlett Johanson and I thought Black Widow and Boromir in the same film, it's got to be good. So I watched it and I was very impressed. <br/><br/>The acting was incredible! Scarlett Johanson, Ewan Mcgreggor, Sean Bean, Brian Stepanek and Ethan Phillips was absolutely amazing. It was flawless. They all really captured the way their character would act really well. They nailed every scene and I really felt for the characters in certain situations. <br/><br/>The whole idea of this movie was very clever and the storyline was very strong. It wasn't like the normal storyline you'd see of the average film because like every good film, it always has something different about it and it's own qualities. The futuristic side of it was very clever and at the same time believable. <br/><br/>The special effects and quality was rather good for something of this time. It wasn't terrible but wasn't like the best special effects you had ever seen and same with the quality. They didn't use that much CGI or special effects really and definitely didn't overuse it. <br/><br/>I will definitely watch this film again. It had me on the edge of my seat and why this film has a 6 on rating, I don't know because from my point of view it definitely deserves a higher rating. Whether it is as high as the rating I've given this film, I'm not sure but higher than a 6 for definite.

"Leofwine_draca","5","1","2","7 August 2016"," A good story, until the over the top action gets in the way
","THE ISLAND is one of those films that starts off promising with an intriguing first hour before descending into the kind of banality that only Michael Bay knows how to make – see TRANSFORMERS for another good example. For the first hour or so we're put into an institutionalised world of clones and cloning and the suspense moves along quite a bit. Although the movie is obviously heavily derived from others that have come before it – LOGAN'S RUN, MINORITY REPORT, most noticeably THE CLONUS HORROR (the makers of whom were compensated due to the 'similarities'), it moves along nicely with some nice supporting acting to drive us along. All right, so Bay's camera-work can be a bit distracting (vertigo-inducing at times) but I was really enjoying it.<br/><br/>Then the two heroes of the film escape the compound and the buck stops there. It's as if that was the end of the script and the guys on set were just making it up as they went along. Sure, there are a few twists (including the inevitable clone-meeting-the-cloned scene) and an ending that confirms EXACTLY to Hollywood standards, but for the rest this is just a big, long bloated action scene that lasts almost an hour and a half after the story ends. Now I love action movies – and sometimes I love films where they're just action without story (usually martial arts films like WARRIOR KING). But the action here is overblown, over-bloated, and soulless, action where they're throwing millions of dollars a minute at the screen but can get hardly anything right. Cars explode, people are shot and blown up, buildings are trashed and people jump off skyscrapers and survive. None of it is remotely realistic but I did enjoy – hugely, come to that – one bit, which is the freeway chase, when the good guys on a truck are off-loading train wheels at their pursuers. Okay, so it's an obvious reprise of the freeway chase in BAD BOYS II, but in terms of sheer spectacle and carnage it takes some beating.<br/><br/>So much time is spent on the action that the ending is really rushed and full of plot holes. Once again we have an enemy base with a built-in 'self destruct' button (or rather, a lever here) that blows the whole thing – why do they make such expensive places so simple to destroy? There are other crazy moments – characters switching allegiance just like that, one character getting captured and not even searched so they can produce a weapon later – but by this stage you end up not caring. The fault definitely lies with Bay and the scriptwriter, because the actors do a decent job. McGregor and Johansson are young, pretty, fairly charismatic leads, and the likes of Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, and Ethan Phillips put in great minor performances. Sean Bean's on hand as the typecast British bad guy but he's still good value for money. The only one who sticks out like a sore thumb is Djimon Hounsou, so good in BLOOD DIAMOND, so wooden here. You wouldn't believe it's the same guy, but then again he gets about three lines of dialogue and the camera just dwells on him looking 'cool' for the rest of it. In the end, THE ISLAND is really a film of two halves – a good first half and a pretty bad second. It evens off as a distinctly average movie, one you can watch but not bother seeing again."

One of the only places in the outside world still capable of sustaining life is an idyllic island where citizens are chosen to live through a lottery. Or at least that's what Lincoln and his fellow citizens are taught to believe; the truth is that Lincoln, like everyone he knows, is actually a clone who is kept under wraps to provide needed organs when the person who supplied his or her DNA falls ill. When he becomes aware that his existence is a fraud, Lincoln escapes to the outside world with a fellow clone, Jordan Two Delta, though the powers that be are determined to see that no one gets away alive.<br/><br/>The film becomes just another Michael Bay action extravaganza where explosions and chases matter more than characters, dialogue, or plot.With elaborate chase scenes and a high-tech feast of CGI to dazzle the eye, it recycles much of the plot from borrowing elements from other movies such as Logan's Run, Gattaca and Minority Report, and while it's not as smartly conceived as those earlier films, there's no denying that, in many ways, it's Bay's best film to date as it was a stunning futuristic thriller about cloning and immortality."

The contained world is beautifully realised and marvellously sinister, and Sean Bean is strong as the Doctor who runs the joint. Sadly lead stars McGregor and Johanssen discover the sinister truth behind their existence less than half way through the movie and subsequently do a runner, after which the tension and mystique dissolves into a disappointingly dull bog standard action flick, as so many of McGregor's movies seem to! It's a sad waste of a potentially classic movie. So I give it 5, 9 for the first third and two-ish for the second part."

Bay as a producer albeit has come up with certain poor projects not to mention his latest craze with the horror and the thrill ones. But as a director I think he is a genius.Well so he proved by making such a flick. <br/><br/>In the story of the Island Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlet Johansson realize that they were simply clones and that they were harvested and in fact simply a 'product' which forces them to unveil the secret of the dirty work that Sean Bean was the head of. They make a sprint towards the outer world to save their lives as well as of the others too. <br/><br/>I'd rate the movie an 8 coz I sort of enjoyed it very much. I wish Bay directs more movies like this and concentrate more on his direction coz Boy he directs just fine."

","The Island is a big, noisy, empty movie. It perfectly fits the bill of the summer popcorn flick. You won't learn anything, you won't leave with any lasting impressions, and if you don't see it on the big-screen, then you're missing half the point. <br/><br/>This movie never tries to be anything more than it is, and I can appreciate that. After the relatively quiet beginning, the viewer is never forced to go very long without gunshots, explosion, or car chases. Some of the action scenes are actually pretty epic, and if you end up remembering anything about the movie after, I'm willing to bet that it will be a few of those. <br/><br/>So as an average, disposable summer movie, The Island is a success. There's little reason to see it again after the first time, though. That's like watching the same exact kind of fireworks twice in a row. Sure, they're still pretty, but the novelty has worn off, and you're ready to see one of the other countless kinds of pretty explosives."

","I'm not a Michael Bay fan. He's all about explosions and over the top action at the expense of plot. His films seem to be aimed at 14 year old heterosexual boys. But I love scifi movies & I like Ewan McGregor so I rented it anyway. The plot was OK. Sort of a Logans Run meets THX1138. It could have been an OK fluff film ... but sexism & rampant product placement ruined it for me.<br/><br/>The constant stream of obvious pointed product placement the entire length of the film was revolting!<br/><br/>Additionally, any film made in my lifetime makes a joke about not giving women credit cards can not be a film I would recommend to anyone!<br/><br/>UPDATE: I later found out he was successfully sued for stealing the plot & even some scense from a movie called ""Clonus"" -- which makes me like it even less!"

I strongly recommend you see THX-1138, if only to watch the amazing closing scene... which bears a striking resemblance to the end of this film, but blows it out of the water.<br/><br/>As a Michael Bay treatment, this of course oozes gloss and an abundance of exploding helicopters (and Scarlett Johannson, adding an action film feather to her cap). But next to zero character development, making it a disappointing addition to the genre. The last third of the film is kind of original, but frankly I lost interest at this point.<br/><br/>For my money, THX-1138 and other 70s films such as Logans Run, would run this into the ground.

","No, they haven't made Lost: The Movie yet. The Island is a part sci-fi thriller part chase movie part dark side of man type of movie. It stars Ewan McGregor in a role that reminds me of the movie that made him famous. No, I'm not talking about Moulin Rouge, but rather his role in Trainspotting. It's a deeper role than he usually plays these days. In this role he must play someone who is naive but at the same time curious and precocious. He is a person who is both lost and found, confident of himself and yet very afraid. Co-star Scarlett Johansson plays his soul mate and at the same time gets to make use of all the commercials she has starred in. Good job.<br/><br/>Lincoln Six Echo is having nightmares. He is on a boat with a beautiful woman (Johansson, who plays Jordan Two Delta) and is about to join her at the helm, when he gets pushed off the boat and drowns. Other than that, he is doing well in his life. Like the rest of his neighbors, he wears only white, is on a strict diet, and has fun playing simulated Knockout with Jordan Two Delta, his lady friend. Other than the nightmares, his main problem is that he is so darn curious. His job by day is to put drops of food into little holes that go into tubes. Lincoln wants to know where the tubes go and gets a stern look.<br/><br/>The ultimate dream of all of his friends and neighbors is to win the lottery and get chosen to go to the island, which is the only area that was not contaminated. It gives them hope and something to look forward to. Near the beginning of the film, Jordan gets chosen to go to the island. That night, Lincoln discovers what going to the island really means, and they escape from the only life they have known. This is where the film becomes more of a chase movie. It had some plot similarities to The Matrix with the emotional feel of Soylent Green.<br/><br/>This was an enjoyable movie that gave me good entertainment for a couple hours. Like most science fiction, I spent the first half of it in a dazed state. Then when I saw what was behind the curtain, it was like an awakening. During this part, I stared at the screen and annoyed my boyfriend by saying, ""What's that? What IS that?"" He didn't know either, but we figured it out eventually. In that way, I got the horror of discovering, along with Ewan and Scarlett, the truth about The Island."

It's interesting to note all the things that would have been great about this movie if it were directed by just about anyone else.<br/><br/>You can actually feel it when the movie deviates from what I think was probably a very interesting script into BayWorld. In fact, I think you could trim most of the 10-shots-per-second action out of this movie and get it down to a very interesting 1.5 hours.<br/><br/>It did make me think about other science fiction that has done it right.

","Movies about cloning ought to be at least thought provoking. Unfortunately they hardly ever are.<br/><br/>And so is ""The Island"" The plot is totally absurd. Imagine, there is a company capable of producing clones. They can even control the age of the clones pretty well. They got actually more control than the cloners in ""Star Wars Episode 2"" have. In Star Wars they can only make the clones grow twice as fast as humans. Whereas in ""the Island"" they produce them right on the spot.<br/><br/>But they are not enabled to keep them alive, without giving the clones a real live.<br/><br/>And that is the plot line! The guys writing the script, Tredwell-Owen, Kurtzman and Orci, just didn't give a damn on logic. A company, having the above mentioned capabilities, is not enabled, to breed a non-clone baby. No, they produce clones, to produce the child. Which ever way you have a look on this, it is rubbish.<br/><br/>And instead of producing clones just in time, they build a big illusion for them to live in. Yeah sure, makes sense.<br/><br/>All right, it's a SciFi. (Did I mention, I'm a SciFi fan?) So don't let's care too much about plausibility. There are certainly more interesting aspects in the movie, aren't there? No, there is nothing interesting at all! The hero-clone meets his original. The original is a bad person! He is trying to get rid of the clone. And the good clone simply replaces the original. Doing so, by provoking the completely idiotic hit men to shoot the real human.<br/><br/>Everyone surviving this point of the story proves to be a good person. And all together free the poor clones. Yuk! Psychology of the main characters: Implausible, unlikely, not credible. Plot line: Just for the pea-brained! Mr. McGregor recently stated, Star Wars was a big fault. Too dumb, to shallow. And what about the island? Big budget, little content!"
"zardoz-13","8","1","2","20 June 2007"," Not The Usual Michael Bay Nonsense
","Michael Bay's science-fiction thriller ""The Island"" (*** out of ****) provides a refreshing change of pace from a summer glutted with prequels, sequels, remakes, and comic book superhero sagas. Despite its abysmal weekend box office figures and the usual critical carping that accompany all his movies, ""The Island"" qualifies as Bay's best movie since ""The Rock"" (1996), that far-fetched but supercharged nonsense about Nicolas Cage & Sean Connery escaping from Alcatraz. A number of things set ""The Island"" apart from its formula-driven competition. First, superstars don't flesh out the cast. Sure, Ewan McGregor receives top billing, but nobody would remember him as Obi-Wan Kenobi in the latest ""Star Wars"" trilogy, because the British actor wields neither a light saber nor does he wear a beard and a bathrobe. Meanwhile, Scarlett Johansson hasn't acquired the clout that Drew Barrymore and Jennifer Lopez command. Nevertheless, she definitely looks bound for stardom in her own right. As a couple, McGregor and Johansson don't exactly set the world aflame like Angelina Jolie & Brad Pitt did in ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith."" Second, our heroes lack career professional skills, trades, or crafts. Meaning, they aren't cops, nurses, pilots, criminals, attorneys, or scientists out to save the world. Instead, they resemble grown-up children without street smarts confronting a hostile society that deliberately misleads them every step of the way. Third, the writers borrow important plot ideas from other sci-fi epics like ""Logan's Run,"" ""Soylent Green,"" ""THX-1138,"" ""Coma,"" ""Westworld"" and ""Planet of the Apes,"" so that ""The Island"" emerges unmistakably as an homage to those late 1960s/early 1970s Watergate-inspired paranoid sci-fi white-knucklers that you enjoy with greater satisfaction based on less information about their plots. Don't discuss ""The Island"" with anybody unless you want them to blow its secrets and surprises. Fourth, Michael Bay has actually helmed a feature-length film that has something relevant to say about our society. Of course, this doesn't discourage the ""Armageddon"" director from hyping up the third act with trigger-happy police, explosions, auto chases, improbable surprises, and the usual demolition derby tactics that Bay has a knack for staging in big, overripe blockbuster blow-outs like ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Bad Boys"" movies.<br/><br/>Cast as Lincoln Six Echo, Ewan McGregor of ""Trainspotting"" plays a compliant but curious nobody in a futuristic society where the inhabitants display no curiosity about their state of affairs and crave no desire to defy authority. Lincolnwe learn--survived a major catastrophe along with several thousand other people that has left the Earth a contaminated wasteland. As a result, those like Lincoln Echo Six must live in quarantine in a Utopian, man-made research facility. The staff monitors their patients' moods, their diet, and their overall behavior. Impatiently, Lincoln and the others bide their time for the opportunity to win a daily lottery and pick up the prize: a trip to a lush paradise known as The Island, billed as ""nature's last remaining pathogen-free zone."" Lincoln stands apart from his friends and fellows, because he allows his curiosity to get him into big trouble. Everything in this huge, antiseptic research facility may not be all it seems, and Lincoln begins to believe the worst. One of Lincoln's unhappy fellow workers insists that the lottery is fixed. Meanwhile, Lincoln gets friendly with Jordan Two Delta (pretty Scarlett Johansson of ""Lost in Translation"") and the two become quite chummy. In the sealed off research facility, nobody may engage in sexual behavior, and the vigilant staff maintain a 'proximity' rule that prevents a man and a woman from embracing. Lincoln Six Echo stumbles onto the truth when a cynical research facility technician, McCord (Steve Buscemi of ""Con-Air""), warns our naïve hero about trusting humans. Eventually, Lincoln figures out a way to break out and Jordan accompanies him. A desperate Merrick (Sean Bean of ""GoldenEye"") hires ex-military, South African mercenary, Laurent (Djimon Hounsou of ""Gladiator"") to recapture Lincoln and Jordan before they can get to the world beyond their clean-scrubbed confines.<br/><br/>The first third of ""The Island"" poses an intriguing premise that Hollywood hasn't handled as forcefully since Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner."" This politically incorrect actioneer about a notorious controversy and its possible repercussions on the life insurance industry seems almost inevitable. Typically, this kind of delicate but contentious subject matter fares better in the realm of science fiction, and the story occurs15 years into the future. About a half hour into this hokum, however, you should be 'wise' to what is really happening in the closely-guarded world of Lincoln and Jordan. Mind you, ""The Island"" is predictable from start-to-finish. Most of you will be one jump ahead of the protagonists. Literary critics call this audience empowerment 'dramatic irony,' because we know more than the heroes. Nevertheless, both Lincoln and Jordan stack up as very likable and sympathetic characters. You'll want them to triumph over clearly impossible odds. Incredibly, the able supporting cast and characters prove just as congenial, meaning you'll care about them, too. The second third of ""The Island"" imitates a horror movie without excessive blood and gore. Like all provocative sci-fi thrillers, ""The Island"" delivers a vision of the future that is as chilling as anything in a holocaust movie. Despite the dreadful subject matter, Bay handles it in a way that makes his points without sickening us. The final third is your average knuckle-busting chase movie with melodramatic story reversals that undoubtedly will aggravate nit-pickers who demand realism, even when realism robs whatever charm any movie contains. For example, our clueless heroes extract themselves from one cliffhanger situation after another that people with their limited brainpower couldn't pull off considering the savvy and resources at the disposal of their assailants! You'll have to remind yourself repeatedly that ""The Island"" is only a movie, but at least it isn't a prequel, sequel, remake, or superhero saga!"

","I saw this film last night and really enjoyed it on two levels, but was ultimately slightly disappointed that the film makers didn't have the guts to go with their vision a bit more.<br/><br/>On the entertainment side, the action parts of the film were well done. Criticising an action film for being unbelievable is pretty pointless, as I can't think of any action film that is realistic, when it comes to the consequences of all those deaths and explosions on a city's streets! As an action thriller, it moved quickly, the protagonists were sympathetic, the villains were humanly evil and self-interested and the set-ups well thought out and entertaining. From that point of view, I just found the ending (and the sudden turn around of the Bounty Hunter from pursuer to saviour) irritating and far too corny a plot turn.<br/><br/>On the second level, I thought the premise of the film was really interesting and unusual...yes, it is in many ways a copy of the Logan's Run idea, but with some modern and relevant twists. I also thought this world was well imagined and peopled, though some of the dialogue was a bit clunky.<br/><br/>My regret, ironically, as I enjoyed the action, is that the film makers didn't have enough faith in that vision, to explore it more thoroughly in a more low key, narrative mode. In order to entertain the audience, they had to go for the action hybrid, where the scenario they have put so much effort into painting, just becomes the backdrop for another (well made, but predictable) action film.<br/><br/>I guess it just points up the differences between audiences 40 add years ago and today (Logan's Run was a 60's film?). Whereas the earlier film was more interested in telling the story, the modern one only uses it to support another genre.<br/><br/>On a final note, I thought MacGregor (in particular) and Johansenn were both fine in their roles (as were the other main actors) so I don't really get all of the critical bashing of their casting."

","The main idea of the movie is quite interesting: in a not-so-far future a big company run by an unethical scientist is creating clones which in due time will be used as organs' donors for rich sponsors. In this part of the movie one can quite easily find features and ideas from other similar movies such as THX 1138, Logan's Run, Coma, even the Matrix. Anyway, what begins as a typical, nevertheless interesting dystopia comes to an end after about 45 minutes (the movie goes over 2 hours), when our heroes (two clones, played by Johansson and MacGregor) discover the truth and manage to escape the ex-military bunker where the clones' ""stock farm"" is. The rest is (again) typical action movie of the form: the heroes run, the bad guys pursue them. You have breathtaking car chases, our heroes hanging outside the facade of a skyscraper, etc. etc. In this case the similarities with other movies are obviously even more evident. All along the movie you have plenty of quite overt ads for companies such as Calvin Klein, MNS, Nokia, Chevrolet etc. What is most disturbing is the ending, which is highly implausible, much more than an average Sci-Fi movie could afford to be. Of course one cannot expect too much likelihood from such a movie, but there are limits a serious movie cannot trespass. The whole is nicely done, well acted, has good special effects, and can provide for 2 hours of relax if you switch off your brain and don't take too seriously what you are seeing (I mean: the story, not the topic of the movie, which is really interesting and deserves a far better handling)."

","Here is the secret formula to the highest grade dope pictures: the more money the studio loses, the higher you'll get off their misery. Take a movie that was way overspent upon that made no money at all in the theater and you'll find it's a blast to smoke out to (and, my friends, The Island currently holds the record for the most money lost on a summer picture). There's a few logical reasons for this, the first being that the movies are rejected by mainstream feather-throats for being ""too twisted"", that elusive ingredient so crucial to herbal cinema enjoyment. A more reliable reason is that much of the over-budget when into the look of the film: art direction, make-up costume design, special lighting and camera effects; all of which are the chocolate chips in the pot movie cookie. This attention to appearance usually comes at the expense of the story's richness, which helps kill the flick in the theater but means nothing to the herbal viewer, as some will lose track of the storyline and interact with the visual framework only. Hollywood should lobby the feds for legalization because then these movies would have a chance to make the tons of money they so richly deserve during there first run. Either that or open more drive-ins. (Dear reader, if you aren't hip to drive-ins yet, twist four and drive as long as you need to get to the double feature.) Now, there's your commercial level flops and then you have you kind level budget-buster: the overpriced science fiction flick, like The Island. You don't even have to like this sort of movie to get your kite in the stratosphere off one. For the first renting feather-throat making the crossover to nickel bag land, I always recommend one of these pictures to show them what THC and a motion picture can create when working together: that sparkling sense of wonder, the mind-blowing vision splendid. That green glow when the lights go off, dig? The Island was way too subversive to succeed. Like 1984 (four leaves) and RoboCop (five leaves), The Island uses the device of a dark near future to comment on modern culture. Everyone toils away in squeaky clean land until you hit it big, win the lottery and go live the good life on this faraway tropical island, like the kind you see on the herpes ads on TV. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two squeaky clean kids who are maybe spending to much time around doper icon Steve Buscemi. Steve Buscemi hasn't been this stoner oriented in years, looking scruffy as all hell, and it's high time. Many remember Buscemi as Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs (five leaves), but his first time his dope comet hit earth was his turn as psycho dishwasher guy in the Goldie Hahn doper epic, Criss Cross (seven leaves). The less one knows about the plot going in the better, as it is a true treat. The fiendish social commentary is juxtaposed with monstro action sequences in the style of The Matrix (six leaves), though they don't mix very smoothly here. No matter: one moment your mind is opened, the next moment a flaming helicopter is dumped in it. This movie also should be noted for the trippiest use of the color white: lots of retina burning, glare juggling shades of white. Of course, all that whitewash is covering up the dark, futuristic truthSix Leaves: Low Glow. A fine dope flick, will make your levitate."

","To make a film good, not only does it need to look good, it also needs a good story. The Island definitely has the good looks of a potentially great film, but I'm afraid the story is, well, a different story.<br/><br/>The idea the film is founded upon is very interesting. In the not-too-distant future, people can buy clones to harvest organs from, should they ever need them. These clones are of course totally oblivious of this fact, and they are fed a substitute world, in which they are made to believe they are the only survivors of a world-wide viral disease. Every now and then, a lucky winner will be selected through ""The Lottery"". This lucky bird will be transported to ""The Island"", the world's last pathogen-free zone. However, the ""winners"" are actually chopped up for their organs. And I don't mean a church organ, either. I will not go into any more details, as you can just as well watch the film for those.<br/><br/>Although the basics of the story are very interesting, and possess the potential to truly make a classic film, they don't. The film focuses on two characters, who escape to discover their world is a figment of someone elses imagination. Up to this point, it is still promising enough. However, as soon as they have accomplished the actual escape, the film turns into a cliché Hollywood action/sci-fi/love story. Despite a few amusing twists and turns, the rest of the storyline is as predictable as a very predictable thing. ""As long as stuff explodes, and I throw in some sex without showing actual sex, it will be good,"" the director must have thought. Unfortunately, he is wrong.<br/><br/>I was also left wondering, haven't we seen all this before? Growing humans like crop happened in the Matrix, as did the virtual world in which we are ignorantly and thus blissfully living. Cloning happens in about 75 percent of the science fiction films, and the sleep-conditioning could have been taken straight out of Brave New World...<br/><br/>Which brings me to another point. Although it is not a direct cinematographic version of the book Brave New World, the similarities are still obviously present. An outsider gets dropped in a completely different world and society from the one he grew up in, people are grown rather than born, the aforementioned hypnopaedia... Yes, I assume it is safe to conclude that Michael Bay read his Brave New World before commencing the filming of The Island.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I will say the following: The Island has potential. Unfortunately, it washes most of it down the drain instead of nurturing it, eventually making it bloom into a classic film. I suppose that it is a commercial success, and isn't that what Hollywood is all about? However, I was left disappointed. Both the story and the presentation could have been so much better, if only the creators would have cared a little less about making a bundle, and a little more about making a good film. But who am I to question Hollywood?"

Great flick for motor-heads and Devo fans. Scarlett Johansson again is relegated to the 'token bimbo' role, but who is capable of so much more. Ewan McGregor basically reprises his Jedi Knight character in a different context."

","I had ignored this DVD on the shelf for several months, not even remembering the trailers when they appeared prior to the film's theatrical release. I knew it cost $125 million to make and produced a paltry sum in theaters. When I finally grabbed it off the shelf and popped it in the player, however, I found a film as enjoyable as Bay's first blockbuster, The Rock.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is fascinating enough, and Bay's rapid-fire direction and $125,000,000 budget don't disappoint. Special effects and action sequences are up to par, and we genuinely sympathize with the plight of the two main leads. Ewan Macgregor and Scarlett Johannson play their roles simplistically (and effectively), although Macgregor's more serious turn towards the end (ensuring both's survival) is a stretch. Djimon Hounsou's turn at the end, while bizarre, makes sense, and Sean Bean and Steve Buscemi add substance and style to villain and ally along the way. Without giving it all away, The Island is definitely a top-tier rental. Be pleasantly surprised!"

My reaction during the film...I was more worried about how much popcorn I wasted because I put too much salt on it before we entered the film. I did not enjoy this film one bit and I truly feel sorry for the people that do. Bottom line, the acting sucked, plot went no where, and the overall feel of a poppy sci-fi action thriller is so played out.

","Probably the least-subtle movie made in the last five years.<br/><br/>Can't ANYBODY get the future right? We use push-plates on glass doors because it looks awful when you leave palm prints on glass. Voice-command for computers is impractical. The idea behind a mouse (and any other GUI that relies on hand motions) is to MINIMIZE the motion required, not maximize it. To disconnect a complex and expensive piece of equipment from a bio-organic assembly, you use bolt-cutters to cut the tubes??<br/><br/>But enough of that. Bay is fascinated with blue eyes. EVERYONE has blue eyes. EVERY SINGLE close-up features blue eyes. Hey, Mike! The majority of people in the UK and US (judging the local of the movie by accents) have non-blue eyes. Therefore, the majority of people in this movie should have non-blue eyes. Unless it's income-based...which I guess it would be.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, and if you have any competition between a male and a female, have the female win, because, in spite of all the advances made on behalf of gender equality over the last 100 years, it's still shocking to have a female best a male. It's contrary to expectations, right? Boy, Mike, you sure are some master of building tension!! <br/><br/>I used to subscribe to the Scholastic Book Service when I was in the 4th grade.

Only in this movie the philosophers and the guards plot against the peasants and use them as ""products"" which can be seen as a bitter conclusion from all the failed well-intended forms of society we've experienced since."
"patbox64","5","1","2","21 May 2006"," Interesting concept spoilt by over the top, explosive action
","Curiosity Killed The Clone<br/><br/>When we think of Michael Bay, provocative, insightful, and thoughtful aren't really the words that spring to mind. Over the years, Bay's name has become tantamount with constant, superfluous explosions, masculine characters bursting with testosterone and sappy, unnecessary love interests. Basically this man is the epitome of Hollywood and all it's shortcomings. But, it seems, the director of Armageddon, Pearl Harbour and Bad Boys has decided to cast away his tendency to create overkill and craft an interesting and challenging film  or so the first forty minutes of The Island would have us believe. But soon after, the fervent Bay shows us step one in how to riddle a delicate flower with bullets.<br/><br/>Opening with several disturbing flashes of memories/nightmares, we are introduced to the dystopian and sterile future of 2019. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan Mcregor), his close friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), and the rest of their white-wearing companions are literally contained within a factory-like bubble, supposedly built to keep the human race from contamination. Regular exercise, a nutritious diet, no physical contact and a discouragement towards ""emotional outbursts"" keep these finely tuned specimens running like machines  healthy and perfect. Like Big Brother from George Orwell's Sci-Fi classic '1984', Sean Bean's Dr Merrick meticulously surveys every minute detail of his Institute's inhabitants and their monotonous lives.<br/><br/>The set, costume design and musical score work seamlessly for this shocking concept of the future. The electronic score blended with real world instruments like strings and acoustic guitar produces an artificially distorted and systematic reflection of the present, while wild, spiritual drumbeats also emphasize the concepts of rebirth (renaissance if you will) that become evident. White, bar-coded citizens walk in single file throughout this sterile, almost drone-like environment characterised by dreary greys, flat whites and pale blues. Various corporations' logos like Puma, Microsoft and Apple appear, but product placement, a common aspect of Bay films, actually assists the atmosphere in this case by reinforcing the role of the facility's oblivious citizens as mere products of the system.<br/><br/>The only way to escape this harmonious yet repetitive Hell is to win ""The Lottery""  a trip to the Heaven-like ""Island"", Earth's single remaining pathogen-free zone. But once Lincoln begins to pronounce existential thoughts, something none of his vastly uneducated and almost child-like comrades have ever shown, this intricate web of lies begins to disintegrate before his very eyes. Steve Buscemi's cynical yet reluctantly moral McCord reveals to Lincoln and Jordan the ultimate truth: they aren't ""real"" people, but ""insurance policies"" for the real world's rich to cheat death, infertility, or unfavourable idiosyncratic qualities. Here, several ethical questions are raised. What is the value of human life? How far will humanity go to survive? Is it possible that humans will simply become products?<br/><br/>After this captivating yet brief exploration of humanity, 'The Island' becomes a different film: it becomes a Bay film. As we are constantly bombarded with a plethora of explosions as cars, trucks, helicopters and buildings smash and crash, the film risks becoming one, massive chase. But, as shallow as this gung ho action is, it is also enrapturing. A particularly impressive scene involves huge, dumbbell like objects tumbling across a freeway, resulting in absolute mayhem. When great, computer generated flying trains zigzag through the gargantuan conglomerate of sky-high buildings, we don't even pause to consider that this isn't real. However, as spectacular as the staggering action and grandiose effects are, it all feels a clone itself. We've seen car chases on a grander scale in 'The Matrix: Reloaded', mind-boggling effects in 'War of The Worlds', and flying jet-bikes are strangely reminiscent of 'Star Wars: The Return Of The Jedi'.<br/><br/>This massive overload also lets Bay show his real expertise: camera work. We watch through speeding dolly shots and soaring crane shots as our heroes ""Run!"" through this futuristic city sprawl. Still shots dart back and forth, left and right. For action fans, this really is Bay at his best. However, as much as this assists the heightening of action, and reflects this distorted, stale future, the ceaseless toggling of camera views between every angle conceivable by man leaves us mesmerised and begging for air.<br/><br/>The cast also has little time to breath in this hysterical sensory-overload. Although Bean is tight and strong as the insatiable yet seemingly benign Dr Merrick, the script and relentless action stops the central characters from developing. McGregor and Johansson are immensely constricted by their roles as uneducated, teenage-like 'individuals'. McGregor, star of hits like 'Moulin Rouge' and 'Star Wars: Episodes 1-3', shows his great versatility as an actor in some scenes, but the chronic action sequences soon succeed in squashing this as the chase erupts again. FHM's Sexiest Woman in the World (2006) Johansson, who starred alongside Bill Murray in the quirky 'Lost In Translation' also gains no chance of producing a fine character, and only appears as enticing eye-candy. Strangely enough, the most interesting and imaginative performances appear in the minor characters: the amusing McCord and belligerent mercenary (Djimon Hounsou). Alas, this only results in even less empathy being attached to our protagonists.<br/><br/>Verdict: Admittedly, this is Bay at his best: he has attempted to produce a fine and confrontational film, but the problem with 'The Island' is that it struggles to define itself. The film begins as an imaginative piece, but suddenly descends into a thrill ride that soon feels stale through borrowed ideas. The passionate action fan should find a home on 'The Island': the massive array of explosions, special effects and smashing glass shouldn't disappoint. For anyone else this is simply a great idea that, in the right hands, could have been better."
"RondoRedux","3","1","2","29 March 2006"," Not as good as ""Parts: The Clonus Horror."" (1979)
","As least the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, known as ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"" (1979) was a barrel of laughs. I could find nothing funny about ""The Island,"" and barely enough to suspend my disbelief. Not to mention the fact that clones are capable of merging into a completely unknown environment as well as successfully operating motor vehicles and weapons they have no previous knowledge of is incredulous. That's not to say that Ewan and Scarlett and not better eye-candy than Dick Sargent and Peter Graves, but even their acting could not match that of the elder screen veterans in such a low-grade movie. ""The Island"" was more of a mix of ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""Matrix"" while not reaching the axis of either."
"DaRick89","6","1","2","23 March 2006"," Typical blockbuster with a fairly outlandish plot...but it is pretty fun and has good special effects
","The Island is a typical blockbuster: great special effects, good entertainment value and a fairly indecipherable plot: good concept, fairly poor execution, to the point where I had trouble understanding the plot by the halfway stage: why were they chasing after these two people? It is a mark of technology today that we can see Ewan MacGregor basically talking to himself: only the 'real' version has a Scottish accent, not an American one. This is a Michael Bay production, so it has a liberal amount of product placement for all to see: Mack Trucks and MSN (?!) to name a few. There is also the clichéd romance between MacGregor and Johannson.<br/><br/>Let me explain why the plot has a good concept but poor execution: it relates to an interesting topic (which another derided yet underrated movie, The 6th Day, has brought up), cloning. How cloning is an illegal conspiracy executed by the rich. However, the direction style by Michael Bay is schizophrenic, to the point where we can barely follow the story.<br/><br/>Now to the good points: the acting was not too bad. MacGregor does a good American accent, Sean Bean makes for a decent villain; however, Johannson and the rest of the cast are merely...there. Just there. Not poor, just ordinary. Like I said, the special effects here were mad. One commentator here describes the special effects as: ""being made by a computer."" But you expect that, what, with today's technology and all. Indeed, I can't name more than one form of entertainment which hasn't been touched by technology in some shape or form. They're good to watch, that's all that matters.<br/><br/>In short, this isn't the mess that every second critic makes it out to be. I am not going to suggest that it is the new 'Die Hard' of action movies; far from it. In fact, there are many better action movies out there. But if you want a nice, entertaining night in, The Island is one to watch. I did not have any prior expectations of this film, as a result, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I'll basically summarise my review into one line: Not memorable, but enjoyable.<br/><br/>3/5 stars"
"mentalcritic","6","1","2","11 February 2006"," A valiant effort, but too shallow to be remembered
","Director Michael Bay has become somewhat synonymous with high-motion action dross that malnourishes the brain and keeps the eyes busy. One could look upon The Island as his attempt to add something that might appeal to those who look for a little intellectual stimulation with their voyeurism, and in some respects, it succeeds. To a large extent, the areas in which The Island excels can be traced back to its performers and screenplay. Ewan McGregor excels at portraying a babe in the woods, despite the obvious clash this brings in contrast with his previous roles, and the cynical, cash-driven alter ego is equally believable. Scarlett Johansson puts in a brave effort to provide a foil and backup for Ewan's determination to find out just what on Earth is going on, but in the rare moments where she is expected to play solo, she is overwhelmed by the underwriting of her character. Fortunately, she works amazingly well with McGregor, and I can see she has a great future in the industry. The question with The Island, therefore, becomes one of what went wrong.<br/><br/>Part of the answer lies in the science aspects of the story. It has been mentioned by other critics, but it becomes obvious to anyone who has studied the deeper questions of cloning as a science that a lot of what is proposed in the film is impossible. Given that Ridley Scott anticipated this very well in Blade Runner, the deep question of how one produces a clone that is not subject to rapid ageing becomes a big disappointment in The Island as Bay utterly fails to address it. To the credit of the writers, director, and actors, they do sidestep the trap of having a clone move, speak, and behave in identical fashion to his source. Ewan McGregor's versatility as an actor is proved by his ability to act against himself, using noticeably different inflections and mannerisms. The moment when one McGregor asks the other about his Scottish accent is a marvellous piece of irony. It is safe to say that this film could not have been half of what it turned out to be without McGregor.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a lot of the problem with The Island comes from Michael Bay and his inability to identify his audience. Up to the moment where our stars escape from the facility, the film is a surreal, complex question about the nature of existence, with elements of horror thrown in for good measure. The moments when we get fragments of the truth revealed to us through the eyes of Lincoln Six Echo are the most legitimately effective in the entire film. No, the real problem starts when Linclon and Jordan leave the facility to begin their exploration of the so-called real world. Bay is unable to resist the temptation to punctuate the rest of the film with car chases, explosions, and shoot-outs. To be fair, one of them is effective. But when they are piled up on top of each other, they only serve to diminish both themselves and the film. Even though it only consists of Joanna Cassidy beating Harrison Ford up a bit before being shot as she runs through several sheets of plate glass, three minutes of Blade Runner has a good deal more emotional resonance than the entire last hour of The Island. Nonetheless, Bay deserves some credit for being willing to take on such an obviously different film.<br/><br/>Sean Bean also proves himself to be the best of the actors who got themselves involved in the desecration of The Lord Of The Rings. His character barely has any depth, yet Sean is able to give said character definition and motivation. In a Peter Jackson film, this is something of a miracle. In a Michael Bay film, even this one, it is like proving that black is white. And therein lies the rub of The Island. Deep questions of mind-boggling importance are proposed by its plot. These questions are foremost on the collective mind (or lack thereof) of present-day society. They literally have the ability to shape the future of said society, determining whether it will ever reach the enlightenment proposed in cartoons like The Jetsons, or whether it will sink back into the relative Dark Ages shown in films like Pleasantville. In case you wonder what I am getting at with such comparisons that have more to do with the time The Island was made in, it is pretty simple. Questions like how we should treat the serious ailments that are burdening our society to the Nth degree and how ethical it is to keep people suffering deserve far deeper exploration than The Island dares to offer.<br/><br/>It is mainly because of the clash between shallow resolution and intriguing setup that I gave The Island a six out of ten. If you are expecting an action film with some more cerebral elements, then you will have such expectations met. If you have believed the hype that Michael Bay has finally made something that does not fit the description of Popcorn Flick to the letter, you will be disappointed."
"Buford","5","1","2","6 February 2006"," Flawed thriller
","This is a cool action flick. Ewan McGregor never disappoints, Scarlett Johansson has turned into a capable actor (and quite a babe), and was there ever such a good bad guy as Sean Bean. (Though, Sean Bean also plays good guys quite well. Check out his Richard Sharpe series.) But -- and it is a big ""but"" -- the movie fails the logic test so badly that it spoiled the whole thing for me somewhat. Hence the 5 of 10 rating. Think about it. If you were running a clandestine clone business for body parts, would you make a 50-something clone of a 50-something man? Would a middle-aged client want half worn-out organs from a middle-aged clone? Of course not. You would use clones that are no more than about say 13 to 15 years old so that your clients would get young, strong body parts. The basic premise of the flick is faulty; otherwise, I would have rated it at 8 or so. Sorry, I can only suspend disbelief so far."
"Rich B","3","1","2","5 February 2006"," A very poorly executed idea with problems throughout the movie, and a very poor DVD offering
","The Island, supplied by LOVEFiLM DVD Rental, was nominated on The Movie Blog Readers Awards 2005 in the category of Worst Execution of the Best Plot, and for good reason too. The film may sound like a superb concept, but the realisation is pitifully poor and this DVD does nothing to help it along, neither do the ample talents of Ewan McGregor or Scarlett Johansson.<br/><br/>Movie: The film starts of really strongly, and promises much from its well crafted plot. The style is slightly removed from Michael Bay's typical blockbuster as we are treated to slower progression of characters and the questioning of McGregor as Lincoln Six-Echo against his reality. <br/><br/>Then, typically, things turn into a big Bay action fest with formulaic plot changes that you can see a mile off. Let me say that I have nothing against those movies because I actually really like The Rock and Armageddon, they're great fun. Yet when you have such a great futuristic plot filled with excellent possibilities, turning it into standard action fare seems quite a sad and easy path to take. <br/><br/>You see half way through the movie it turns into set pieces which are badly thought through and harshly edited. For instance, take the highway scene where Echo pushes train wheels off the back of a flatbed truck. Those would be train wheels for the magnetic trains that run without wheels that we saw a few times at the beginning of the movie or the fast car used in a high speed chase later in the movie is racing along one second and then the immediate scene after which is tracking the car shows the door wide open, raised in the air, as these doors do. What just happened there? Then there's the jet bike sequence, and we seen these bikes for well on half their screen time before you can actually see that there's a second person on the bike, mounted at the rear. <br/><br/>Typically the close cropped camera work, far too fast cuts, and harsh editing make these action sequences difficult to follow. Sure it's not as bad as some of the Bourne sequences, but this is tough to follow in places. <br/><br/>There's similar issues all the way through that make you think there have either been some serious continuity errors, someone hasn't been thinking of the universe in which the movie is set and checking all the story changes, there's been some harsh editing, or indeed all of the above. <br/><br/>There are some saving graces though, and I'm not talking McGregor's American accent, although the moment when he confronts his real self and he has a Scottish accent which he mimics is very amusing. No, Johannson fares very well here, as does Djimon Hounsou, let's just say they do the best with what they have. I mean how can you deal with lines such as ""I like it with your tongue"" in the middle of a romantic kissing scene? I get that they haven't kissed before, but it sounds corny as hell and comic. <br/><br/>Picture: 2.35:1 Anamorphic: The picture was sharp, although the colours were slightly drained and the contrast harsh throughout. <br/><br/>Audio: Dolby Digital 5.1: A good audio track, some great LFE during the action sequences, but a DTS on such an action film could have been better, that and some subtlety! <br/><br/>Extras: TV Making of Featurette, DVD-ROM Extras: I actually just thought that there was a single featurette on here which was extremely poor, so after a quick look I sent it back. However I'm now led to believe that there is a full audio commentary from Michael Bay hidden away on the PC DVD-Rom section. <br/><br/>Well I never saw it and it's not because I didn't try. I put the DVD into my PC and it attempted a straight install of its own player. Since I already have my own free player I cancelled it and attempted to access anything new on the disc - nothing was visible. Nowhere did I see the mention of the audio commentary now being enabled, perhaps I missed it, but if you're going to offer it only on the PC side don't force an install of your own software and make the features plainly visible. <br/><br/>Overall: A very poor movie with a botched up DVD offering. Hidden audio commentary, forcing install of it's own DVD software, is just not on. Poorly put together and a not very enjoyable movie at all."

","not Being a fan of blockbuster movies, I found myself renting this on DVD. The idea is interesting and raises interesting questions, however the 6th day also deals more or less in the same theme, so it's not an original idea.<br/><br/>so the first half hour is very interesting as it raises questions of why is there this sort of 1984 society in 2019, however as soon as Macgregor starts running away from explosions you see the true aim of the movie. Instead on focusing more on the characters and the interesting story they had in hands, the old movie clichés are brought into the equation, like the quick killed sidekick, the romance, the hero who thinks of the others before himself. Typical blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>Also I found Scarlet's character totally unnecessary, remove her from the movie and you get exactly the same movie, she was not needed at all, but of course, every blockbuster needs some pretty eyes.<br/><br/>Also some very bad and predictable moments, when the guy who helps Macgregor escape says he goes get a map, it was obvious he was getting killed, or when Macgregor sponsor says he's going to get some shoes it was obvious he was either calling the police, or get a gun or call the makers of the clones.<br/><br/>And a bit far fetched was the fall from the building with both the hero's holding to the ""R"" logo, very unlikely they would survive that.<br/><br/>This reminds me of the new Star Wars films, excellent material to work with, but badly put on screen due to the necessity (why?) to show SFX, eye candy and explosions.<br/><br/>Also the product placements were.. unnecessary and hard to believe that in 2019 the xbox logo and the msn search logo will look exactly the same after almost 20 years!"

But that's just for half an hour and then the two main characters manage to escape and the rest of the film they are haunted by some gone-crazy mercenaries.

This is not a movie that 20 years from now will be remembered as one of the great films of out time, however I still think that it is worth a look at the video store. Go out, rent it, pop it in and for 2'hours and 16 minutes you should be entertained.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson is charming and sexy, and holds her own as an action star, Ewan McGregor shows that he is more than Obi-Wan Kenobi and Renton. Sean Bean is very good, as is Djimon Hounsou, whose work I enjoy more in everything I see him in. Some of my favorite characters in this film are the supporting cast, such as Ethan Phillps who is probably best known for his role as Nelix on Star Trek voyager.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by those who might tell you to avoid this film, just do not go into it expecting to see the next great Sc-fi movie.

You would think that after the laughable, and offencive disaster of Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II no studio exec in his right mind would let Bay get within five miles of a film set. Well, not really, since in Hollywood money is the bottom line and both of the aforementioned stinkers raked in tons of cash for Bay and his all-powerful buddy, producer mogul Jerry Bruckheimer. The Island had potential to be more than just a silly Hollywood blockbuster most people will forget in less than one year. But a good sci-fi plot has been thrown to some of the worst hack script writers in tinsel town and the result is a ridiculous film which leaps and bounds in degrees of absurdity with each passing moment, and this film is so long that by the time you get to the end the nonsense parade really gets out of hand. There are so many 'give me a break' moments and continuity holes in this turkey it might as well be Swiss cheese! Yeah, sure, the special effects look great, and the action chases are sort of cool; and yeah, everyone loves looking at Scarlett Johansson in a tight outfit, and yeah Ewan McGregor does a fair job of a terrible script with no help from a terrible director...

","From the man who gave us BAD BOYS 1 & 2, THE ROCK and Armageddon.. Michael Bay is back with another face paced action thriller.. This time, it's set in the not too distant future..<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor stars as clones who are based in some kind of 'underground bunker'. A facility where these things called 'agnates' are born and breed to become human clones.<br/><br/>As Lincoln Six Echo begin to question about his feelings, his life, his orifice.. He believes that something is not right. As he explores around the facility, there is something more than he bargained for.. The idea of 'The Island' dosen't really seem to exist and Lincoln believes that clones are being killed off as a result.<br/><br/>With a help of a friend McCord (Steve Buscemi), Lincoln begins to realise the truth. So, he takes Jordan Two Delta with him.. as they both head out to the outside world.<br/><br/>Hot on his trail are Albert Laurant (Djimon Hounsou) and his team of 'feds', who is put out by a psychopathic scientist Dr Merrick (Sean Bean) to stop them.<br/><br/>What I find so interesting about this film that Michael Bay is just one of those directors who like to take his audience for a ride. Whether it would be car chases, people running around, maybe a few shootout scenes here and there.. That's Michael Bay's movie direction for you..<br/><br/>Now, what I find was so bad about this film.. I believe Michael Bay has casted the wrong stars in this movie. Having Ewan McGregor..? Well, Ewan is a good actor. I respect him for when he'd appeared in the first Star Wars trilogy as well as the classic Trainspotting. But I didn't feel that Ewan was really up to it. If Micheal Bay was looking for a good actor who could run around, drive a car, shoot guns. Maybe people like Will Smith, Tom Jane, Johnny Depp or even George Clooney would be good to play as Lincoln Six Echo.. Scarlett Johansson? Well, I suppose she would be good as Jordan Two Delta.. Then again, Michael would've considered Angelina Jolie, Carrie Anne Moss or even Uma Thurman.<br/><br/>Another thing was most of the action scenes didn't even start until 50 minutes into the movie.. So, most of the first part of the film dragged on for a while. At that point, my eyes were about to close..<br/><br/>I don't blame Michael Bay for directing this movie which turns out that it flopped at the box office.. I read on this site that the writers for this movie 'blamed' Ewan and Scarlett for letting the movie project down. I guess they were hoping for Michael's film to be another one of his box office money spinner.. But then again, these things always happen.. No one can judge a film if it's going to be a success, when the movie is currently made. A lot of people may've worked hard, tooth and nail for Michael Bay to give it more stamina to get keep his audience in the mood. But unfortunately, this one didn't work out for me..<br/><br/>I must admit, Michael Bay is a great director. No doubt about it. When I saw the featurette, he was saying that he likes to shoot fast and see how well he progresses until the end of the day.. But with The Island, there was some steam coming out of this one. The story of this film may sound good, but I felt that it was a bit over the top really.. The idea of the 'clones' going out of their troubles just to find out who they really are..<br/><br/>It's a shame that we only see Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi and a few familiar faces that has worked with Michael Bay on his previous films just for a short amount of time. There wasn't really nothing new to be honest.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, it was a good film.. But shame that were so many flaws on this one.. Better luck next time, Mr Bay..! 5 out of 10!"

","I was wondering if there was anybody else who noticed that the plot of this flick was damn-near cloned from ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"" which was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 oh, too many years ago. (How I miss it...) <br/><br/>Anyway, many have. And it is. IMDb actually lists it as a remake. But at least this one starts off being a lot more compelling, stylistically speaking, and even has that ""Logan's Run"" feel to it. A promising start, but once the protagonist clones head for the hills, or the desert, or whatever, it basically just degenerates into another Michael Bay flick...shaky camera, things blowing up, fast cuts, eternal car chases (known by some as the ""drum solo of movies""). At this point I hit the sleep button on my higher brain functions and begin counting the ticks on my biological time clock. Believe me, it is not a place you wanna go...cinematically or otherwise...<br/><br/>So bottom line, sort of a ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"" clone with a makeover, prettier actors and a new set of kidneys to boot. Oh, and did I mention the commercial breaks or ""product placement""? Enjoy! Or don't!"
"supah79","6","1","2","13 January 2006"," Not as bad as I thought
","The reviews for this thing were miserable. This film was the turkey of the summer (box-office wise). But after watching it, I have to say it wasn't as bad as the reviewers made me believe. It's not good, but no more worse than the average Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>It's formulaic: that means a male lead, a romantic interest, an evil corporation sending lots a bad men to kill the lead and of course a car chase.<br/><br/>I haven't been a fan of Ewan McGregor since he moved to Hollywood. I thought he was perfect in Trainspotting. But whenever I see him in an American film, with his forced American accent, he comes of as inauthentic, unnatural. Thus is the case here. He doesn't bring something extra to the part of Tom Lincon.<br/><br/>Johansson is grosly underused. I had the same feeling with Angelina Jolie in 'Gone in 60 seconds'. It's not Johansson's fault she's the damsel in distress for two hours, she's just working with the material she's been given.<br/><br/>Bay's direction is as can be expected. Beautifully shot, with hyper-kinetic action. Bay's also one of the few action directors who has an eye for human drama. But he doesn't reinvent himself like most great directors do. His style has been the same since Bad Boys. Too bad, when you're this talented, you have to take a chance and try something else than summer blockbusters.<br/><br/>The thing that irritated me was the fact that this film is loaded with product placement. Normally you see one or two brands, but this film has something like 10 brands in bold, shiny letters coming through the screen. I know Bay's background is advertising, but if he wants to make commercials he shouldn't be asking me to pay an admission fee."
"721mm","4","1","2","11 January 2006"," Quite possibly the most disappointing movie of 2005
","The special features on the DVD of The Island include some interesting insight from one of the technicians on the set. He casually looks into the camera and says, ""We don't read the script, we just show up for the toys."" I suspect that he does not simply speak for himself; I only wonder how many of the filmmakers shared the same situation. After sitting through the entire film, I imagine that the answer to my question is probably a very large number. When watching films like this, I often get the impression that the filmmakers were in fact a large group of 12 year old boys trapped inside older men's bodies, who were given an enormous amount of ""toys"" (ie explosives, helicopters, $600,000 cameras, etc.) to go out and play with.<br/><br/>The Island is another unfortunate example of what science fiction has become to Hollywood with the evolution of special effects, massive budgets, and pyrotechnics. For a moment, let me address the fact that much of today's special effects were born in the studios of classic science fiction films  films that actually used the effects to tell wonderful, intriguing, innovative stories. The ingenuity of the filmmaker's methods to create ways to show some remarkable shots reflected the same ingenuity of the story it told. Those films  like 2001, Metropolis, Blade Runner, Contact, and Solaris  all took us to places we had never been, but could still believe in and become intrigued by. It gave us the opportunity to explore the part of our minds that lets us know the experience of wonder, to imagine places and things greater than ourselves. There was brilliance behind every one of those films, and they could have started a genre that, if treated properly, could have created one of the most original art forms of our time. It could have created a bridge between the intellect of science and the emotion of art, two things that currently seem so far apart that they just might have come from opposite ends of the universe. Alas, those few select films exist as the pariahs of cinema, treasured by many of us, but never enough to stir Big Hollywood into further exploring their true intellect.<br/><br/>The Island is a perfect example of the resulting by-product. Ewan McGregor stars as Lincoln Echo Six, alongside Scarlet Johansson as Jordan Two Delta, who live in the confinement of some unknown facility. The facility is a futuristic version of a frighteningly socialist institution, where a population of people  all dressed the same and walking in single file lines  are told what to eat, when to sleep, what to do for work, and not to get too close to their fellow ""inmates."" They are told they are the survivors of a contaminated world, which is uninhabitable, save for a paradisal island. Every night there is a lottery, and the inmates are made to believe that the winner of the lottery gets to head off to the splendor of the island. Their actual purpose and where they actually go is revealed once they win, but Lincoln Echo Six discovers this on his own, and he is forced into action when his forbidden interest Jordan Two Delta suddenly wins the lottery.<br/><br/>As its synopsis may sound, The Island starts out as a captivating and intriguing film  one that sets up a philosophical/moral dilemma. This setup sets it aside from other kinds of sci- fi that work by focusing on the action. Movies like that are Jurassic Park and Terminator 2, which understood their value and their opportunity to earn thrills and embrace the excitement of a big blockbuster. The situation in The Island, however, asks us to think about a deeper question than those films. It doesn't just use science to create a situation where all hell can break loose or where people can learn kung-fu in 10 seconds. Instead, it uses science in such a way that we empathize with its characters because they are the victims of a morally corrupt futuristic practice. Because of that, when (about a third of the way through the film) Michael Bay basically says ""screw the story, let's blow stuff up,"" I felt cheated. <br/><br/>This is perhaps the most upsetting part of the film. The Island quickly falls victim to an even more upsetting trend in modern sci-fi  that is, it touches base with a really great idea, and then destroys it. Like John Woo's Paycheck and the Wachowski brothers' Matrix sequels, The Island's story never garners enough respect from its filmmakers to truly explore its themes, to immerse its characters in them to discover how they might affect the human mind. Instead, The Island quickly turns on itself. It almost completely disregards the fascination set up by its story, and instead decides to exploit it for just about every crash, explosion, fight, and cheesy line possible.<br/><br/>Like Paycheck, The Island could have been great. Some people were pleased with the overall experience of the film, having received a good dose of the action/sci-fi hybrid. I, however, lament yet again the current status of a genre that has such great potential. Is all hope lost? I certainly hope not, and I can't help but feel a swelling of hope when I see the preview for something like A Scanner Darkly. Even if we only receive a brilliant sci-fi film every 10 years, the ideas in one of those films might inspire enough thought to withstand the wait. Still, it'd be nice to not have to wait that long. The Island showed promise, but then failed miserably."

","Spawned from the soulless heart of the director Michael Bay If you've never heard of him he directed such greats as the Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. To say there is nothing nice to say about three films is a slight exaggeration but not as much exaggeration needed to follow King Kong. The island seems to be another pretty product, that stretches poor Michael's imagination bless him with only MTV to guide his action sequences he falls far from the mark in producing anything but a series of Music videos to advertise big name brands. This was connected by not the story line but by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson who at a guess is why you'd watch the movie in the first place."
"tricksixxx","7","1","2","8 January 2006"," Michael Bay Nails It
","This is a very good film. Michael Bay has a real gift at stylizing action sequences. Though he failed with Armageddon, and Bad Boys 1, he blew the screen up here. Much like the feel of action in Bad Boys 2, The Island has an interesting premise and a few decent actors. Sure we have seen the idea before, though I wouldn't compare this plot to Logan's run as some have. This movie takes a couple of old ideas and gives them a life of their own. Without giving anything away, when the protagonists in the movie kiss for the first time, it is definitely magic on the screen. This could have been an excellent picture if not for some flaws of reasoning, but again I don't want to give anything away, so you make your own judgement there. I will say a couple action scenes are a bit over-the-top, but good action is why I watch movies like this. The reason this movie gets above a 5 though is because I was really impressed with the pace of the movie and the ideas behind the plot. He does a good job of predicting what 14 years from now may seem like, instead of making it way out of reach. Watch this picture with some popcorn and a girlfriend fellas, it's a lot of fun."

","It's the year 2019 and the age of cloning humans is reality. A colony of clones paid for by rich sponsors are living in an underground community completely oblivious to the outside world. The community is run by an evil conglomerate named Merrick and he uses the clones as holders for organs until the sponsors need them. The clones are unaware of this and believe they are only living in this community until it's their time to go to the island which is an exotic living space surrounded by ocean and paradise. When it's the clone's turn to go the ""island"", they are in fact killed off and their organs are kept. Two of the clones (Ewan McGregor, Scarlet Johansen) discover the secret and ultimately escape and are now on the run. <br/><br/>""The Island"" starts off as an interesting premise, but later becomes a typical chase film. Michael Bay, who likes his films loud and full of falling buildings, blows up lots of stuff and makes lots of noise. The action sequences are well done and you certainly won't lose interest, but the storyline gets away from the original premise and gets very routine. The acting isn't very good either as this is Scarlet Johansen's worst performance that I can remember. She's probably a lot better in ""Match Point"".<br/><br/>This movie isn't awful. There is much worse than this. I just wish the director and writers would've stayed on track a bit more with their story because it started out pretty interesting. (**)"

","This movie would definitely be an 8/10 if it wasn't for two huge problems: many time period confusing moments and really jarring product placements.<br/><br/>If I remember correctly this is the year 2019, and everything is supposed to be futuristic. We see these high-tech methods in place where urine is detected by computers when you pee into the toilet, and video cameras are embedded into your dresser. But then we see MacGregor running through the compound undetected by security guards. Why are there guards to tell people to ""watch their proximity"" and cameras in dressers, but no guards at night, and no cameras in public areas??? Also, when they appear 'above ground' again, why is nothing futuristic? Only few select things, like the train are. Why does this new train run on fiber-optic rails, but cars still burn gas? If Hollywood learned something, and they obviously haven't, product placements can only be acceptable when they are NON-INTRUSIVE. Apparently in 2019 everybody drives '06 Chevys, uses MSN search and plays on Xboxes that apparently are super-high-tech. These placements do NOT belong in a Fantasy movie and cheapen the whole thing incredibly. At least in I Robot, we get the explanation that his shoes are from our century, here it just makes no sense.<br/><br/>A movie that could have been an 8/10 is dropped to half that because nobody can hire a decent consistency editor or realize that product placements do not belong in fantasy movies."
"Buford_Lurch","7","1","2","2 January 2006"," You WANT to go to The Island
","The tag line for this film is ""They don't want you to know what you are"" and that pretty much sums up much of the plot of this visually stunning and fast-moving futuristic thriller. The action and chase sequences are tight and well-choreographed and the movie provides a lot of awesome eye candy. Ewan McGregor does a great job as Lincoln Six Echo, a man about to come into his own and Scarlett Johannson does just fine in a role that really did not demand a lot. I do not want to get too deeply into plot details, as the story is predictable enough without that, but fans of futuristic sci-fi and action should really enjoy this fun film. Watch for Djimon Hounson as Albert Laurent... he shines in an underwritten and underdeveloped role."
"bobbyf","7","1","2","31 December 2005"," Bay's Best? Maybe. Revisited Material? Definitely.
","I, for one, have never been a big fan of Michael Bay's films. His action sequences are always far too over-the-top. He also tends to use the same mechanisms in all of his films: Shaky zoom camera work in the car chases, things falling off a truck into traffic, every scene shot in late- afternoon sunlight, etc. His style is easily recognized, and I have always thought his films to be too much style over substance. The Island is no different. A good story is given second seat to outrageous action sequences. Unfortunately, with the story not getting the attention it deserves, it falls flat. There are many films that have dealt with similar subject matter that this film borrows heavily from. The Island is made up of bits and pieces from ""THX 1138,"" ""Logan's Run,"" ""The Sixth Day,"" ""The Darker Side of Terror,"" ""Coma,"" and even, ""The Matrix."" I give it a 7 for technical merit and production values, but it will most likely not make my list of films to own, unlike some of the others I mentioned."

","This movie was entertaining however the ideas of the Island this movie closely resembles the 1976 movie ""Logan's Run"" but it does differ in plot due to the advances in film and also the advances in current events since the 1970's. I did enjoy this film, not only by the computer graphics, but how we are able to portray human beings as animals. This movie is very morbid when we think about it, we are pretty much cattle that is used for someone else's benefit. . I've read some reviews about it being close to the Matrix, and I disagree. The only thing that might resemble that movie is where the people are being harvested in pods. It deals with real human emotions, and human instincts. It does have a great plot in where you are supporting the character Lincoln Six Echo throughout the whole film. I am going to give this movie a 7 out of 10. However that might change once the 2006 ""Logan's Run"" is released, id like to see the reaction of viewers when they see a remake of a remake."
"gradyharp","4","1","2","22 December 2005"," A Good Idea in the Beginning Trickles off into Noisy Nothing
","Had the writers and director of THE ISLAND been able to sustain the fascinating first half hour of this flimsy film, the result might have been an enlightening examination of the current discussion of cloning. But as soon as the movie captures our attention it fizzles and what is left is two and a half hours of noisy endless destructive chase sequences that put this reviewer to sleep.<br/><br/>Using fine actors like Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson and Sean Bean one would think more attention would have been paid to a good script. They have us in the beginning as we slowly come to realize that this space-age environment is not the 'rescue place' from the end of the world by contamination, but rather a very expensive human cloning lab where wealthy people up on top of the subterranean lab life have paid huge sums of money to have duplicate donors on whom to rely for organs and integument as age begins to erode their own. Every 'person' in the lab (thinking that they are waiting transfer to the Garden of Eden Island of the title) is actually a manufactured copy of the owners topside.<br/><br/>Well, not all secrets can remain hidden and McGregor follows a butterfly to discover the truth about the venture and the rest of the tale is McGregor's and Johansson's escape into the world above in search of their 'real' counterparts. Once on the surface of the earth the movie goes downhill fast in a mixture of special effects and destruction derby that it just loses all interest. This is a movie that only avid fans of McGregor and Johansson will want to see - because there is little else to recommend it! Grady Harp"

","I watched this on August 14th 2005 and i was blown away, the scenes with Ewan and Scarlett was amazing, they really want to go to this island, and then one of them does. I just thought this is what the Matrix was supposed to be. Honest opinion i think, its a classic story of love, hope and action. And all of this is shown in this film. I think this film took me by surprise because i always thought Michael bay was terrific but i didn't know he could make a film like this. I was extremely disappointed with the Bad Boys films, so i was glad he decided to do something we love, his masterpieces. A great film that will keep you laughing, crying and screaming for more, at a long 2hrs and 17 mins, you wish it was 24 hrs and 17 mins, you'll never want to leave the cinema. And Sean Bean is the perfect villain. And he's so calm, and the small cameo by the black guy from The Green Mile, he was totally amazing. You should watch this."
"Braxus","5","1","2","6 December 2005"," Incoherent and Unsatisfying
","So is this just another Michael Bay movie with hilarious non-stop-action but a non-abundant plot? Yes and No. During its first half the movie tries to be a more or less serious science-fiction movie. The story is definitely not spectacular but at least there is some science in the story as compared to most other big budget science-fiction movies of the last years like Matrix where the science aspect was abused to justify original action sequences.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds more and more during the first hour one is actually tempted to think that this is not a Michael Bay movie if you don't consider the annoying soundtrack and the stylish look of the movie. But after about half of the movie the Michael Bay we use to know takes over. Maybe this guy suffered from a schizophrenia attack while shooting the film or he had another director direct the first hour, I don't know. All of a sudden any logic and plot development is dropped and replaced by a mindless chase and demolition scenario. The remaining storyline could have been told in 15 minutes. I don't think that there should have been no action in this movie but such an uneven distribution between plot and action just divides this movie into two smaller ones that have a total lack of reference between each other.<br/><br/>In Summary if you want to watch a decent science-fiction movie you should stop watching after half of it. If you want to watch a typical Michael Bay movie you should start watching after half of it is over. This leaves you with two incomplete movies, a circumstance that I don't find very satisfying."

"zell1290","4","1","2","23 August 2005"," Pretentious and Over-hyped
","Having not shared the large scale disappointment for Pearl Harbour i was rather looking forward to Bay's next big screen outing not to mention the exciting prospect of Scarlet Johansen and Ewan Mcgregor. I was then amazed to learn that the film featured both Sean Bean AND Steve Buscemi - two of my favourite actors. I was starting to expect great things from this film. However the omens began after viewing the trailer - though the film looked terribly exciting i couldn't help feeling sleight Battle Royale vibes stream off the screen but i decided to ignore it when walking into the cinema to actually watch the film itself. However what I was presented with was what one would find when The Matrix and The Truman Show were mixed. The basic idea of the film was so similar to Truman it was uncanny, people living in a controlled environment, blissfully unaware of their captivity with everything running smoothly by a scientific big shot (Bean) until.... someone starts getting wise to everything (McGregor). My reference to the Matrix comes with the shots of ""fields"" of humans being grown and harvested, shots of people being given birth in water and ""pods"" of people...definitely some resemblance there somewhere. One good thing about the film was the chemistry between McGregor and Johansen, the pair together acted very well, perhaps in order to make up for their less than impressive individual performances. Bean is yet again incredible, his accent pushing the crisp, dark tones of his character though could still see some Trevelyan there somewhere...not that that is a bad thing! Buscemi, again, inspiring! Buscemi's talent ranges from his famed wild eyed expressions to his incredulous remarks about the various situations he is put in helping the fugitive pair. I was disappointed being quite a big Mcgregor fan ever since Star Wars, in which i thought he was superb, he actually did better as the part of his Scottish counterpart, a fair few laughs between the pair. Overall, get it on DVD if you looking for a night time movie filler, but not worth seeing at the cinema."

","Michael Bay has spent more time of his life making commercials than other directors do in the beginning of their career, making him an expert in just that. Doing commercials teaches you a lot about shooting a scene in detail with some originality (Guy Ritchie comes to mind) and therefore his visual style is the best thing on offer in this action movie, here enhanced by an interesting screenplay, a good production design (Nigel Phelps) and nice cinematography (Mauro Fiore). And without Bruckheimer as producer he is willing to aim for something higher, not afraid to take a chance. It's a pity that this failed at the box office in the US (although it did a lot better in the rest of the world), as it is one of his best movies and it shows once again the unpredictability of the public. Lessons will be learned and next time he will surely make a dumb movie again.<br/><br/>The way the clones are kept on the facility is a mini-world in itself but also a commentary on the consumer society we have become, as the clones behave as consumers but also one level higher there are clients ordering them. (In this context it is rather clumsy to put in that many product placements.) As work and religion are used to keep the clones under control, the food scenes in the beginning serve as an indication of how humans become greedy and picky, using social behavior to get what they want (Jordan) , and also becoming investigative (Lincoln). With the lottery as indication of personal luck, but only a lie. The director of the facility sees himself as an earthy equivalent of God (and the bad guy an Englishman again, what have they done to deserve this?).<br/><br/>Time is taken to set out the story. When the action scenes follow, Bay knows where to place his always moving camera in a scene, in contrast to Rob Cohen for example. The POV is especially good in the car chase scenes with objects going right at the camera and in the skyscraper scene, where depth is put to good use. But it is sometimes a little too long and there is a tendency towards overkill; some rock music is used without any effort to check what songs would work. In more detailed shots of computers and handling of objects it resembles Minority Report. The futuristic city and post modern homes make it visually attractive to look at. Many of the perfectly framed and colored shots hint in the direction of that other Spielberg-movie, AI.<br/><br/>For once this movie is not too long, but too short. They could have elaborated on the start of the facility and on Sarah Jordan (obviously dead without touching that in the movie), because as she was severely ill that created the ethical dilemma the whole movie was about: Is cloning allowed for your own medical purposes? The movie makes a strong case for no, as even the former black liberty fighter joins the battle and McCord also helps out (with his death as a result)."

","The special effects and overall picture is well-made. The future as presented is not advanced as in many other science fiction movies. This actually makes the plot much more trustworthy. However the minor details of the ""new"" technology is not well considered, which spoils a lot. It often shows, that the director works for the wide audience. The two popular actors and the mandatory action and comedy scenes steals the focus from the basic idea of the movie. Although I don't find this idea of a plot new since it has much in common with the one in The 6th Day. Schwarzenegger is gone and we follow the ""product"" and it's experience of the World more closely. The idea was good back then, but I don't see any reasons to use it again only with two new characters. This not at all with so many little detail errors.<br/><br/>A good advice: If you don't want the traditional action movie with the big stars, but one that captures your mind and thoughts afterwards, then choose another movie. This is just another fast Hollywood production."

","I recently saw Michael Bay's most recent outing 'The Island' not expecting much, and so, as I'm sure many did, came away pleasantly surprised. I confess, I am an avid Ewan McGregor fan, his performances seem to get stronger and stronger with each new role, and I have loved Scarlett Johansson's work ever since 'Lost in Translation' graced cinema screens the world over, but I did not think that either of them could save a film from the sometimes diabolical Bay. Although it is hardly difficult to see how Bay manages to make a living. Even the atrocious 'Pearl Harbour' filled seats all over the world despite being the cinematic equivalent of having 'USA! USA!' barked at you for upwards of 3 hours. How then, with the testosterone-addled Bay behind at the helm, would 'The Island' fair? I was most pleasantly surprised. McGregor and Johansson give better-then-average performances as childish clones Licoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta, and Sean Bean (the most under-rated man in Hollywood) gives a competent performance as the evil scientist Merrick. Walking away from the cinema something dawned on me. Bay, as a film director, is crap. Honestly, the man can't go 25 minutes without blowing something up. However, he is a talented action-sequence director, and I love the fact he shows restraint, not using computer animation when a good old-fashioned stunt will do. Bay is, when one gets right down to it, no more then a talented action-sequence director. 'The Island' has (a little) more to it then that, however, and it seems as though, after SPECTACULARILY failing at weaving a love triangle together in 'Pearl Harbour' (possibly the worst war film of all time), Bay has decided to leave the acting bits to the actors and focused on what he excels at: blowing things up."
"noralee","4","1","2","18 August 2005"," Good Looking, Bloated Patsiche of Dozens of Other Sci Fi Films
","""The Island"" is a bloated pastiche of dozens of science fiction movies magnified with an enormous budget. The DVD could come with pop-up footnotes of every other movie that's referenced -- from ""Logan's Run,"" to ""Brazil,"" to ""1984,"" to ""Coma,"" and even Woody Allen's ""Sleepers,"" and on and on and on. <br/><br/>With about forty-five minutes of exaggerated, laughably ridiculous chases from bad guys who can't shoot straight cut out, or else there's another twist that the lead characters are really cats with nine lives, there could have been a serviceable pedestrian futuristic thriller with visually entertaining production design, comparable to ""Imposter"" and somewhat better than ""Paycheck,"" though both had more substance from their Philip Dick stories than this film. <br/><br/>It is refreshing to have a docile society broken-through first by human curiosity before it gets around, very briefly, to sex (as learned from Scarlett Johansson's Calvin Klein commercial), which somehow leads to the sudden development of a contagious moral sense of human bonds that abruptly crosses over to an effective Djimon Hounsou.<br/><br/>Almost everything about it is confusing, from the time setting that is far enough into the 21st century for technological development and various building abandonment, but not so far away that a blizzard of contemporary product placement is still possible, as the social, economic, environmental and political structures seem pretty much the same as the present. Sometimes the plot holes that go by are quickly covered up further on with passing dialog. Humor also helps, particularly with Steve Buscemi and plays on Ewan McGregor's real life persona. <br/><br/>But the faults of this film have to lie far more at the hands of director Michael Bay than the writers or the overwhelmed actors, whose blue screen outlines can be glimpsed. On ""The Tonight Show,"" McGregor had described other filmed scenes that involved more human interaction and could yet show up on the DVD.<br/><br/>The classical riffs in the soundtrack are borrowed to good propulsive effect to try and differentiate the endless chase scenes. <br/><br/>While we do see where all the money went, shouldn't Bay get as much financial backlash as Cimino did for ""Heaven's Gate""?"
"stamper","7","1","2","17 August 2005"," THX - t.e.s.t.o.s.t.e.r.o.n.e.
","It has been mentioned often that this film borrows a lot from other Utopian / futuristic films (for me most notably THX, because of the white suits and the setting) and actually I've read that it is a remake of a film called The Clonus horror, The Island can be seen as a film in itself. While I admit there is a lot of borrowing I cannot get why people are upset by this. If people go on like that they might as well argue that Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, exactly 70 years later, partially borrowed from Nosferatu (1922) in the case of the medallion of Ellen/Mina which is not in the Dracula novel. Also you can start moaning that For a few Dollars More is a remake of Yojimbo that A.I. - Artificial Intelligence is built around Pinocchio and Bicentennial Man by Isaac Asimov and on and on and on.....you get my drift. What I am saying is that this is all BLAH by people who hate the movie anyway...be it good or bad. What to say about the Island itself then? <br/><br/>Well first of all let me say that the advertising was extremely bad. They make commercials for a film called THE ""bloody"" ISLAND and during the whole trailer we do not get to see of hear anything about an island. Then there's a SPOILER: the 'I am Tom Lincoln scene' which ruins part of the movie, not to mention the good old from the director of...I MEAN REALLY; COME ON...that's not a reason to see a film so cut that crap out. The trailer would have been much better if it had been on the lines of...IN THE FUTURE...AFTER A CONTAMINATION...THERE ARE BUT TWO PLACES SAFE FOR MANKIND...AN OFF-SHORE PLANT WHERE MANKIND IS TO WORK AND REPOPULATE...AND A REMOTE AND MYSTERIOUS OASIS CALLED THE ISLAND...BUT WHAT THEY DO NOT KNOW...THERE IS NO ISLAND...THERE'S ONLY DEATH then cutting towards some gruesome scenes and some action...'THE ISLAND'...OPENS...! Blame the producers for the BOMB, not Scarlett and Ewan and don't bother blaming Michael. It's too easy...I mean when they actually advertise 'By the director of Armageddon and Pearl Harbour' everybody knows what they'll get. I mean it's like complaining when you go see a Woody Allen movie and and get out saying 'I can't believe he played a neurotic dud AGAIN.' <br/><br/>Of the whole movie I liked the first hour best, because there was actually quite a lot of plot and it was interesting to see 6-Echo (Ewan McGregor) and 2-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) out in the world. In that first hour the film was very variable as well. There were some touching, some funny moments and it was generally interesting and well paced unlike for instance THX-1138 which drags on and on and in 88 minutes covers what this one does in 45 or so. Then the film becomes THX on testosterone. Huge explosions fights and, well... all the Michael Bay stuff. Don't get me wrong, I like big bangs and stuff but Michael, well it's all too 'produced' for me. Really I mean his films are like 2 hour commercials...everybody looking so styled even when they just went up in flames...and the colors...plus I think his trademark camera-work is getting older than John Woo's white pigeons. Anyway, I felt that the second hour wasn't nearly as good as the first one, for it dragged on too long. I get that feeling often nowadays with movies. It seems to me that they have plot for something like 100 minutes but they try and stretch it to just over 2 hours with elaborate action scenes and 'not quite yet' endings. Too bad filmmakers want to tie everything up nowadays...I felt the same way with Mr. and Mrs. Smith which I felt dragged a bit in the end too...but maybe that's just Hollywood.<br/><br/>I generally do not dislike Michael Bay although I must say I didn't like Bad Boys II. He is what he is as is Kurosawa, Spielberg and Scorsese. I mainly went to the cinema to get entertained, see explosions and watch a beautiful Miss Scarlett...maybe see a plot. I was satisfied reasonably on three counts and very much on the third. Yet the length of the movie and some ridiculous action scenes (oh let's do that...we haven't seen it done like this and it will be more spectacular than the scene in...) spoiled a bit of the fun. Great work Ewan, Scarlett, Steve and the people from make-up. Michael...reconsider your style and what your doing at times.<br/><br/>6,75 out of 10 (with a small 7 given upon voting)"

","Michael Bay leaves other directors in his wake as he retains the coveted title of the best action/adventure director today. In the Island, Bay merges the styles of John Woo and Michael Mann to his own unique blend of direction and the cocktail is a success as he continues to strengthen his legacy.<br/><br/>As odd as it is watching Ewan McGregor spew out an American accent, one can't help but admit they were wrong in assuming he had been miscast in this action caper. In fact, McGregor demonstrates his ever expanding range and leaves audiences more then satisfied with his performance as an action hero.<br/><br/>The voluptuous Scarlett Johansson is not only a joy to gaze at but this pouty bombshell is a versatile talent to boot as her beauty is matched only by her ability. There is a natural and smooth chemistry between the two stars which is best illustrated in their first kiss which should snap up the MTV Movie Award for best kiss.<br/><br/>Dijimon Hounsou and Sean Bean rounds out an eclectic more then capable cast which also has Steve Buscemi and a brief appearance by Michael Clark Duncan in tow. Bean convincingly portrays the role of the sinister Dr. Merrick who suffers from the ultimate God complex while Honsou is perfectly cast as the hunter who is responsible for chasing down the 'products'. Buscemi had the audience chuckling with his performance while the gigantic Duncan who was nominated for best supporting actor The Green Mile, is hardly used at all.<br/><br/>The combination of an eclectic cast and vicious heart pumping action which leaves you gasping in awe as you jump back in your seat makes the Island a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

","The movie was watchable and entertaining. However, there is one aspect of the movie that I couldn't get through or overlook. The present day is supposed to be around the year 2050. When running and trying to escape, you see various vehicles both in the chase and just on the streets. There is a really sweet looking Mack truck for instance (very futuristic) but the cop cars look like Chrysler 300's, Pacificas and even an H2. I saw a Volvo and even an ugly Honda Element. These cars (other than the cop car modifications on a Chrysler 300) were all from present day? Are we to believe that buses run on some type of light track and subways run on wires in the sky, but cars look like cars of 2005?"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","2","11 August 2005"," Top of the line
","The summary line is not particularly complimentary of the move, but merely says that it's the best popcorn summer action flick that we have had this year, doing a little better than the competitors in just above every department.<br/><br/>Let's start with the cast. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson, who should require no introduction, play two clones ""Lincoln"" and ""Jordon"" respectively. Sean Bean (who will always be Boromir to me), one of the best character actors around, plays a clichÃ© ""evil doctor"" role, bringing to it an attention-compelling presence that few can. From the Tarantino gang is prolific Steve Buscemi, who is sure to be remembered for every movie he appears in, playing a scientist with a good heart employed in an evil organization. And then there are two power house black actors. Michael Clarke Duncan from ""The Green Mile"" unfortunately appears in not much more than a cameo role. However, Djimon Hounsou, who was so impressive in ""The four feathers"", has a reasonably good role as a top bounty hunter whose character is more complex than what it initially appears to be. <br/><br/>The movie can conveniently be divided into two parts. The first is somewhat formulaic, telling an often-seen story of how the two main characters gradually discover that things are not what they appear to be. These are actually two among hundreds of clones, created in a secretive plant for the purpose of providing replacement organs to their owners. Led to believe that they are survivors from a contaminated outside world, they are referred to as ""products"" behind their back and monitored closely to, among other things, prevent them from developing too much ""proximity"" with one another. They are not cheap but, as one owner says, ""At 5 million dollars, they are well worth the price, for cheating death"".<br/><br/>The second part starts when the protagonists, i.e. the aforesaid two clones, develop something the scientists that created them failed to anticipate, minds that are more similar to human mind than is comfortable for the enterprise. Lincoln and Jordan escape from the plant, starting scene after scene of exciting chases, explosion and all the neat things you expect to find in this genre. Photography and technical effects are absolutely first class. Particularly praiseworthy is the metropolis created for L.A. in the near future, that is neither too futuristic nor too present-day. The balance is just perfect in this movie. <br/><br/>There are also thoughts to dwell on and they are well handled, suggestive without being too heavy-handed. Whether clones are actually human and have the right to live would be an expected question, but another dimension is added when Djimon Hounsou questions whether some humans are considered less than human as he shows how his hand had been branded after the failure of an uprising he took part in. The familiar man-playing-God theme is also touched on, with some pretty good dialogue. <br/><br/>There is also humour, again well balanced and well placed. Acting in this movie is obviously no challenge to the two principals. McGregor has a little bit more, playing in some scenes both the clone and the original. The ending must bring back ""Logan's run"" for those who have seen it. It is also an aesthetic wonder and a visual allegory.<br/><br/>Just to reiterate, all the unreserved praises about should be viewed in the context of a popcorn summer action flick."

","The Island is foremost a typically shallow film with so many explosions and crashes that it could literally give heart attacks to the elderly.<br/><br/>It's a film about the future of human cloning. It tries to answer the question of the possibility of it happening. When a man (Mcgregor) living in a quarantined centre after a supposed world war questions everything about his existence and the relative world, he uncovers some deep conspiracy that dangers his life.<br/><br/>Mcgregor and Johansson does an OK job in expressing their fear and determination to get back their lives into normality. Buscemi is the only one that seems to be enjoying his role. He brings his typical quirky humour that has made him one of the best supporting actors working in Hollywood. It's a travesty that he is not getting bigger roles in films and not just be the obligatory comic ""sidekick"".<br/><br/>Bay directs this film with so much bravura and zest especially in the action scenes to cover the missing plot holes and simpleness in the narrative. He is just going through the motions as this is the same type of film as his others.<br/><br/>If you like your films loud and fluffy, then this should be just your cup of tea.

","I liked the first half of this movie, I thought Ewan and Scarlett Johansen did a great job portraying their characters. It started out as a cool, original, somewhat creepy, science-fiction movie, and it caught my interest, especially the scene between Ewan Megreggor and Sean Bean in the office, and even when he confronts his sponsor. But once the two characters got into that Cadillac, the movie took a drastic turn. It went from a plot driven, thought provoker, to an explosion invested, Bad Boys II look-alike. Maybe it's because Bruckhiemer wasn't there to dictate Micheal Bay's every move, so Bay just spliced some of the Will Smith high-way scene into The Island. Don't get me wrong, Bruckhiemer/Bay films definitely have there place, and I do enjoy them, but the tone and style of filming is being carried over into movies that should not be, but are, driven by action. Some of the action, like the scenes with the flying motorcycles, or Wasps, were quite good and entertaining, but the chase scene on the freeway or the sequence when the two main characters fall out the window of a building and cling to a gigantic letter R, which no one knows why is there, and fall to an implausible net below, could have both been revamped and made into sequences that actually pertain to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a decent movie, and worth seeing for yourself, but it could have been much better...."

Mix these three movies in a bowl and stir in a little bit of super computer special effects. All in All though I liked the movie and thought it was entertaining. The IMPOSTER with Gary Sinise also comes to mind as there is a similar plot premise in this future technology movie. I couldn't believe the chase scene with the railroad train car axles.

"SmithWrite","7","1","2","6 August 2005"," Fun with lots of action, but why didn't they fix the plot problems?
","As with so many films in the thriller/science fiction, ""The Island"" does a great job setting up its premise, but loses credibility when the scriptwriters allow plot discrepancies to get out of hand to the point of absurdity.<br/><br/>SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER 1. Mccord gives Lincoln and Jordan his credit card, then tells them not to use it after the first 24 hours because he will have to report it stolen. He dies before they've even left, so presumably he hasn't yet contacted the credit card company. Yet at his death, the card has that status.<br/><br/>2. The Information Services booth has no trouble figuring out from all the people in the U.S. named Tom Lincoln or (Whatever) Jordan exactly which ones the clones are trying to contact.<br/><br/>3. The police car stops in the middle of the intersection for no particular purpose other than to make sure it is in the way of the monster vehicle that will momentarily be barreling down on it.<br/><br/>4. Even though the clones are in L.A., it never occurs to anyone to put Tom Lincoln's residence under surveillance to see if that might be their destination.<br/><br/>5. Somehow Lincoln and Jordan figure out what a taxi is for and how to use one, even to the point of tipping, because there's no indication the driver pulled away angry after dropping them off.<br/><br/>6. No one seems to react to the news that Jordan has left the state in search of her sponsor, when one would expect them to move the whole team across country.<br/><br/>7. A trained Army seal doesn't search an arrestee for weapons before sitting down next to her in a car. Of course, considering Jordan was wearing only a tight tee shirt, it should have been readily apparent she was carrying a gun. Otherwise, where did she get it? I was also bothered by the gratuitous waste of a ""valuable product."" Surely considering the way they controlled everything else, they could have brainwashed the ""breeders"" into willingly surrendering their babies rather than killing the mothers after they gave birth. Why wouldn't the original woman want the clone kept around for the same purpose as the other clones in case she needed a spare part? Or what if the couple wanted to have another child? They'd have to wait another year and put up another $5 million. Clearly this scene existed just to give Lincoln something horrible to discover and/or make the corporation seem even more terrible than a smart business would actually be.<br/><br/>Finally, instead of the ridiculous notion that adult human bodies wouldn't seek out sexual activity just because they hadn't been ""taught"" it exists, wouldn't it have been more credible to program the clones that such activity was terrible and that violations of the ""proximity"" thing could jeopardize their chance of getting to the Island? Undoubtedly some of these problems exist because of the massive rewriting the script went through since its original incarnation. For example, I got the feeling there was supposed to be a whole lot more behind Jordan's reaction to the little boy mistaking her for his mother, rather than just simply eliminating the question whether Jordan or the mother should survive by announcing the mother was brain dead and couldn't be saved.<br/><br/>Someday perhaps Hollywood will learn the difference between an okay film and a great one is having someone watch the thing with a critical eye so that logic and common sense can be used to identify and eliminate all the ""no, that wouldn't happen"" moments."
"nowonmai42","5","1","2","6 August 2005"," Michael Bay tries to act like there's more to life than wreckage
","Watching ""The Island"" is like observing someone trying to pick up a pin while wearing hockey gloves. Director Michael Bay, specialist in Shiny Things That Blow Up, here unexpectedly finds himself dealing with an idea, and an opportunity to make a film that isn't hateful (""Bad Boys II""), boring (""Armageddon""), or, well...""Pearl Harbor."" He partially pulls it off, which is a compliment. Although it's not saying much, this is Bay's best film to date. Perhaps it's just his miserable track record, but I found myself rooting for ""The Island"" in spite of myself.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie, down to the marketing, screams ""house of cards in a hurricane."" ""The Island""'s ad campaigns have clumsily spoiled what could have been a passable surprise, namely that the dystopic colony of the film's first half, populated by track suit-clad, metabolically-monitored drones is actually a clone farm for the very rich and very ill. When replacement parts are needed by their ""sponsors,"" subjects are cast as lottery winners, to be whisked off to an imaginary island paradise, supposedly Earth's last refuge from a mass contamination, also imaginary, that these ""survivors"" are told led to their arrival. This is a good set up that could go in a number of directions, but Bay seems impatient with having to spend so much time on sequences that operate at less than 100 MPH. While intriguing, ""The Island""'s first half feels rushed and sloppy. It's amazing to see, in a colony where even urine is analyzed as it hits the commode, the ease with which its inhabitants are able to hatch secret plans, wander into off-limits area, and hoodwink security systems.<br/><br/>Like a little boy squirming as mom wipes his face after dinner, Bay finally gets to go outside, and seems much surer of himself on the more familiar ground of jet motorcycles, giant dumbbells wrecking expensive cars at high speed, and chases among flying trains. The film is from here out thoroughly in combustion mode, and is as entertaining as such stuff can be, though annoyingly strobe-edited as in previous Bay apocalypsi.<br/><br/>There's interesting material in ""The Island,"" from notions of corporate bioethics to the human survival instinct to the nature of existence, themes that could be probed with a subtler and less hyperactive hand. Some of the great earlier Schwarzenegger films have delved into this material, and it's a measure of Bay's temperament to note that those films seem to be intimate character studies in comparison. As usual, Bay is most interested in fast-moving objects meeting fiery endings, but with ""The Island,"" he at least tips his cap to something more challenging. I suppose that's a start."

","Good Movie. i watched this on a Saturday night and i really liked it to some extent. The story was like a big mixture and reference to other Sci-Fi movies, like Minority Report, THX - 1138, The 6th Day, Total Recall, and more Sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>The plot is about Lincoln Six-Echo who lives in this facility, which is made for survivors from a contamination on earth. Lincoln and the other survivors are always given a chance to go on a lottery spin to the Island, which is supposed to be the last remaining piece of beautiful land. But instead of him winning it, his dream girl Jordan two-delta gets a chance to win it. then when the plot goes more deeper as to what is really going on on the island, Lincoln tries to go on a chase, escaping with Jordan to find out what is really going on.<br/><br/>The Acting was good. I give full marks for Ewan Mcgregor after Star Wars Episode III. Scarlet Johansonn looked good in some scenes but was not going to a full acting job. Sean Bean and Djimon Honsou were good within the scenes, but were forgotten by the end of the movie. The only actor to stay true was Steve Buscemi with his Humouristic reach and dialogues. The plot was really going well in the first half but after all the action sequences and chases, the second half diminishes down to the ground. The Ending too was a little bit predictable.<br/><br/>Technically, Michael Bay knows how to set the action right. He uses everything to the full as he did in Bad Boys II and The Rock. The Highway chase looked really cool and didn't bore me down. his use of Cinematography in that scene was like actually wrecking the camera and just happy he got it on film. The Visual effects and Sound was good too, you wouldn't notice them much. The other thing that also took me was the Art-Direction and use of big spaces.<br/><br/>So is this film worth your Saturday night? Well it depends on how you see it. you could either exit saying that Michael Bay has tried something different here and worked or you can say he just stopped having fun in this film and tried to have another sense of direction.<br/><br/>Well the Island is all that and good action.

","If there is always one thing prevalent in Michael Bay's body of work, he's never consistent. Since Armaggeddon, his films have consistently become more inconsistent with his original work, movies like The Rock and Bad Boys. The big difference with The Island was the fact there were enough things to like about it.<br/><br/>The overall design of the film was quite ravishing, especially the scenes in the utopia that all of the clones lived in. And this time around, Bay didn't try too hard to make people think he was something more than an action director. What I also liked about the film were the two leads Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. It seems laughable that such an unlikely pair would be in a movie together, but they did manage to convey a little innocence and humor in a movie that looked like it would be devoid of such things. But I also thought the film was successful in the area that it didn't really take a side in the whole cloning debate. Society was greedy enough for such luxuries, and who wouldn't be if you had the money?<br/><br/>Sadly, the filmed seemed to fail on its biggest promise: the action. The action sequences were daring to say the least, but they were so poorly shot and executed that you couldn't really tell what was going on. Listen, we know stunt doubles were used, so would it kill anyone if the whole ""shaky-hand-held"" concept be dumped for better sequences? I was disappointed by the fact Djimon Hounsou and Sean Bean were such poorly written characters, for a lot could have been done with both of them considering the multiple quandaries that existed in their heads.<br/><br/>Overall, this is certainly a movie worth watching, especially with the way the film is exposed and color timed (compared to the ""pristine"" clarity of digital). I'll certainly buy it on DVD.<br/><br/>P.S: It was also another strike against my hometown Tucson. (just watch Revenge of the Nerds, The Wraith, Eight-Legged Freaks, Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Alice Doesn't Live here Anymore, The Thirteenth Floor, etc.)"

","Standard summer action flick. Intriguing story. Great action. Many plot holes and inconsistencies. Neither main character would have survived each of the 2 falls off the building. And what a totally lame love scene. And how did top ex-commando security let an armed girl back into the facility ??? And just where was the hospital that perspective clients were visiting? - no parking lot for those guests either... Sure maybe Ewan needed some action after playing old fogie Obi-Wan but after the latest string of Oscar and Golden Globe nominated performances why did Scarlett bow to do this fluff ??? Another great character actor goes for the paycheck over the plot I guess. And they could have made some cool cars for the movie instead of using last years concept cars right off the autoshow stage. It was a wild ride but it still a standard summer movie and unfortunately very forgettable. Roeper was right this plays like 2 completely different movies. They should have concentrated on one of them and made it better. Yes Scarlett Johansson is a babe but also a wonderful actress and deserves much better than this movie."

I like movies that don't really provide a whole set of answers right away. We're kept unaware of what the island is, what the contamination means, why the uncontaminated people have to follow certain rules and diets and so forth. You get to know more and more about these things, as you venture with Lincoln Six Echo, a particular curious uncontaminated person.<br/><br/>But then suddenly all of the unknown things are revealed, and from here on out, it's just an action packed chase of the 2 escapees, who somehow manages to function perfectly in a world they've never set foot in before.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The action sequences were really well made and intense.<br/><br/>What really annoys me is, that the idea about the contaminated/uncontaminated persons, the island, the perfect society the live in and so on, is really cool. If he (Michael Bay) had just kept us in the unknown for a bit longer, making the story more about finding out about who, what, where, when and why, then it would have had so much more quality.<br/><br/>An overall OK movie, great action, but just leaves me a bit disappointed in the end."

","I have a personal pleasure about this film. Many of the street action scenes were filmed in Detroit. I worked downtown and our department was about to shutdown. So I had the joy of seeing this movie filmed first hand. What a kick!!! The movie is basically two films as many of you may have already heard. The first half had wonderful science fiction themes though at times they resembled other futuristic films. The second half was pure action and very well put together. I can honestly say that this was a ""fun"" movie to watch. Good suspense, good visuals, the acting wasn't too shabby and the storyline stayed pretty logical through the majority of the film. I don't know if this qualifies as a spoiler or not, but there is a scene where one of the main characters has a confrontation in front of a huge statue inside a broken down complex. This is our old Union Train Station on Michigan Avenue. It was a perfect spot for this part of the story and a blast to see it on the big screen (as a child, I used to play near this statue..or something like it). This movie itself could have run another half hour to explore some ideas presented in the film. But as it stands now...it's pretty good. Want to see a good sci-fi with some interesting action sequences...then this is the movie for you."
"mmmm_fruitpies24","7","5","25","9 July 2005"," Dreams, Metaphors, Latin?!? This is not your typical Michael Bay flick...yet somehow, it is?
","The first thing to great your eyes in the Island, the new film from action director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, the Rock) is not something you would have expected. It is not a car chase, it is not a fight sequence, it is not the introduction of the Latin American drug dealer villain showing us how villainy he is by killing somebody in cold blood and stuffing his body in a straw basket. No...it is, how do I put this? It is a dream. A lovely, nightmarish dream. A dream in which two people float towards an island paradise, apparently in love, obviously escaping some sort of a horrible tragedy. The dream ends when some pale, veiny humanoid creatures pull our main character into the water. Cut to: a white, desolate apartment building. Our hero, Licoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), awakes from his dream, goes to the bathroom, looks at himself in the mirror, and gets dressed. It is an opening sequence worthy of an art-house Utopian Society gone wrong picture rarely seen in todays blockbusters. And especially rarely seen from someone like Michael Bay, a person who, like many of you, I'm sure, don't particularly like. (I even bought the Team America Soundtrack just for that one song: Pearl Harbor Sucks) Yet even as amazing as this opening sequence appears to be, it will all but be erased from your memory as we see Lincoln get dressed. Because the first thing you see as he opens is drawer filled a few pairs of shoes and white, uniform jumpsuits, is the Puma and Nike symbols shamelessly slathered across each piece of fabric and shoe heel like maple syrup on pancakes. Every five minutes we are greeted by a new product trademark (Aquafina, Chevrolet, even XBOX for Christ's sake) and we are quickly reminded that even though this film may seem like something we've never seen before, in essence, it is. The first thirty minutes or so of the movie contains no action sequences, but character development and actual explanation of the society these people live in. I don't want to ruin it for you, so I'll just say that the first thirty minutes of the movie are good, the next hour and a half there are action sequences galore, so no need to fear. Despite all of new things Mr. Bay has shown us in this film (The Island is the metaphor by the way...it shouldn't be that hard to figure out) we eventually realize that this is a Michael Bay movie. Slow motion falling shots, bullets being seen flying through the air, sweeping shots of cities, the camera swirling around a main character, to name a few. So even though you'll be disappointed at the few flaws the film has (the product placement was my main complaint) there is some new stuff there too. You'll just have to sift through the bad to find the good (hell, there's even a recurring theme in the form of a Latin word, tell me you've seen that before in a Michael Bay flick) It's kind of like combing the beach of a tropical island. If you just keep searching, you'll find what you like. Who knows...you might even love it.<br/><br/>7/10"
"cmcmanus60","7","5","26","10 July 2005"," Michael Bay crossed with a good script = Solid Dumb fun
","Saw a sneak preview last night in Phoenix Arizona. This film has all or most of the prerequisite Michael Bay traits; Some silly dialogue, loud electronic music scores, and ADD. However, this time he actually had a decent story to work with (The Rock notwithstanding, I have detested every other film Bay has worked on). While I wish he had done more with it, to ignore this film's popcorn entertainment value would be a shame. It really is a case of 2 different movies. The first 45 minutes develop the story, then the action kicks in and never lets up. Recommended, just remember Bay's pedigree and don't go expecting great cinema or you will be disappointed. Also, Scarlett looked about as hot as chick can get. I went with my girl and 2 other couples and ""everyone"" thought so."

","I first had the pleasure of seeing this wonderful carjacking wreck of a film in my RS class after exams. Throughout the majority of the first half, I was completely focused on the action! Of my Nintendo DS, on which I was in a heated multiplayer session of Bomberman with my dear friend. <br/><br/>Every so often, I would raise my weary head from the world of cheery music and downright stressful strategic planning to watch the heart-tearing acting of that iTunes updating McAfee son of a gun during his most poignant moments of depressing and scary music and slightly less stressful but far less efficient strategic planning. <br/><br/>Tedious stretches of plot followed- oh no, not tedious in a bad way! Tedious in a good way, like having to put up with a paint splattered flirterer going at your speed during a marathon. With a stitch. Overall, these sections consisted of lots of lukewarm acting (but the characters were hawt) and harlot-poppingly bad delivery of iconic lines that the screenwriter clearly intended to provoke intelligent thought- ""Why can't I have bacon? What is tofu?"" Regardless of the little dragon sniffles here and there, one cannot deny that these lines did a curtain-slack-jaw job of making the audience truly believe the horrors that these clones were unknowingly facing. <br/><br/>Then I died on Bomberman because a lot of these lines are pretty gosh darn weird out of context. ""LET'S DO IT IN THE HALL."" That was probably my fault for dying? Uh. I was watching the gripping action, directed by the stellar Michael Bay. All of those explosions could only improve my gamepla- I died again. Can we blame the rich people now? The film did certainly make a point of that. Pretend it's because the messages of the film stuck with me to the very end, like...my brain constantly sending me the message to just stop functioning. Or to stop the DVD player from doing so. <br/><br/>Oh, and now asexual people are just sheltered children waiting for their sexual awakening via Scarlett Joanne Hannah's Son and Little Calvin. Ta, Michael Bay. I owe you one for accurate representation. <br/><br/>Time to be serious? Ugh, fine. Good ethical dilemma. Give us more than two moments to comprehend emotional scenes, although I suppose they *were* with pieces of cardboard anyway. Unless your idea of emotion is non-stop explosions, guns and car chases, but I couldn't appreciate any of it because my manly, bad-arse nature would not let me look at the explosions. Ignore my vagina, look at my man card. Yes, I did actually watch this film, after the lesson. No, I am not drunk. <br/><br/>This film shook me to my very core of disbelief because that is what you usually say when reviewing a film. I think that Michael Bay has changed my life, but this film in particular was a failure because it failed to incorporate any Skull Bombs or Sticky Bombs. Our great backwards cuffed computer tab of a director, Lord and Saviour, must learn soon, before I asphyxiate him with a pair of used cycling shorts. Taste the Lance Armstrong muscles on your skinny baby men, bay! Vive la dope ain't a nope! <br/><br/>Let me completely blunt with you here, I had more emotional connection to Bomberman. Toodle pip, Michelle Oak."

","This is a dreadful film. I don't know if it was always dreadful or if it's just aged badly in the last 7-8 years but in 2013 (where apparently we'd be half way to having flying trains), it was garbage.<br/><br/>First off, the plot is a mish mash of rip offs from other films, visually in particular a complete rip off of The Matrix. This film wishes it was The Matrix though; rather it's The Matrix if it was written for Nicholas Cage. <br/><br/>Everything gets explained about 3 times, when really none of it needs explaining because it's so blatantly obvious. The cast for some reason speak the action as if it's a film for the blind. <br/><br/>Run! He's coming! I need to swing around for another shot! Oh, he missed! Go! Go! We need to run!<br/><br/>All unbelievably boring and obviously full of chase scenes in which things explode for absolutely no reason. My (least) favourite being when a massive truck did a cartwheel because it drove into a giant dumbbell. <br/><br/>And just on the date, why did they set it in 2019? This always confuses me about sci-fi films. This one in particular is set just 14 years into the future from the filming date, yet they have flying trains and bikes and the ability to clone humans since, apparently 2015. In the real world, an extension to the London-Manchester-Leeds, non-flying railway got announced and that won't be ready until 2030. 20 years. I mean seriously, just set it in 2060 or something. <br/><br/>Just as for the title of my review, I can't believe they actually said ""My name is Lincoln"", during a climactic fight scene with the bad guy. Seriously? Whoever wrote/ripped off this script and entire plot must have no shame. Just that one line knocked this down another point from a 3/10 to a 2/10. Still, they probably got paid a fair whack, so if people really don't care, fair play to them, I suppose. How this film's user review first page is full of good reviews though, I have no idea."

","6.9? How? HOW? First off, this movie is a 100% rip-off of an old cheesy B movie called Parts: The clonus horror. It's so similar, there's no way that this wasn't a rip off, but it's not like anyone expected Michael Bay to be original, right? The development of the story is a mess. It has a sudden and uncomfortable position from a slow paced sci-fi film in a dystopia to a fast paced action flick about running away from people.<br/><br/>We got a good cast. The acting's alright. Djimon Hounsou, a terrific actor, is completely wasted playing a mercenary without any true personality. Sean Bean plays a decent villain. Steve Buscemi doesn't have enough screen time. Ewan does his best. Scarlett doesn't do much.<br/><br/>I won't lie. This film does have a couple of good action scenes, but at the end of the day, I felt unsatisfied. I guess it's mainly because I felt rip-offed. I had already seen this movie. No, it's not the worst movie that Michael Bay has ever done, but it's still a bad movie. A couple decent action scenes can't make up for the movie's lack of any imagination, style, or wit."

","A 70's film with the same argumentation , named ""clonus"" is exploited in ""the island"" with the ability of a donkey by Michael Bay and results in a parody of intelligence To put some example, I remember that in ""Alien 4"", was explained that the protagonist, a clone, inherited the ""memory"" of original Ripley by crossing her genes with genes alien. Because of another form it is impossible. In ""the island"" , is possible. The scene in which they fall of a skyscraper taken hold to a freight elevator to clean crystals: in the following plane, the logic would be the appearing of CSI team catching the little rests. But in the imaginary world of Bay, a perfectly make up Johanson's appear to us without a single moved hair. Why it is possible if does not appear the Virgin making a miracle. Michael Bay, wanted to hide a strong moral speech in this film. But this time he couldn't deceive the spectators. Making as himself he obtains the reverse effect in whose thinks about the moral implicit in the film: he say us ""don't play never with science and don't touch stem cells or the world wold be as in my film"". This silly and simply message , with more than 2hundred of lies that appears in the film are less convinced than G.W.Bush tell us he say the true. honest message is necessary to it, and cannot be given if it has been involved in brainless argumentation and false science theories."

","Now I know why The Island flopped at the box office. It starts slow and the story hits no doubt a very hot problem as in Arnie's THE SIXTH DAY. What I missed then was high tension and emotions and even the end was for me very disappointing. I didn't like the picture quality and the action scenes were not the best ones I have seen. I am not a fan of sci-fi thrillers but here I thought the story plays in near future but this experiment failed for me completely. On IMDb the vote is too overrated and first I hesitated after I read the critics but then I thought this could not be so bad but it was!!! The biggest problem with this movie is the script and the director that realized this project. The actors couldn't take advantage from this catastrophe and delivered just a routine job.

"EUyeshima","5","2","7","12 December 2005"," Bay's Visually Arresting and Mildly Diverting Smorgasbord of Futuristic Movie Clichés
","As the king of big-budget Hollywood bombast, director Michael Bay has a reputation so commercially oriented that it's hard to view his films without some amount of visceral disdain. His latest venture is not an artistic breakthrough for him, by any means, but it is a diverting though overlong entertainment that seems to be an amalgam of John Frankenheimer's 1966 sleeper ""Seconds"", Ridley Scott's classically visionary 1982 ""Blade Runner"", Michael Anderson's comparatively cheesy 1976 ""Logan's Run"" and Philip Kaufman's 1979 savvy update of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" with plenty of references to Bay's previous blockbusters thrown in as well. Clocking in at 136 minutes, the result is a confusing shuffle, but he has certainly assembled a grade-A cast to inhabit the rather cartoonish roles headed up by Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as two residents of a sterile, futuristic society. Their characters' names - Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta - should give you fair warning of the world in which they inhabit with trepidation, and the first hour seems like it could lead to a more thoughtful analysis of the transience of identity at a time when it is not valued.<br/><br/>The cliché-ridden screenplay (co-written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Caspian Tredwell-Owen) provides the derivative concept of a brilliant but greedy scientist who has figured out how to clone the rich and famous in order to allow them to take organs or even entire bodies when age and disease set in. The clones - unable to mature beyond the age of fifteen (how convenient) - are programmed to think they are humans living underground to avoid contamination unbeknownst to their ultimate fate. Alas, once Lincoln and Delta figure out what's going on, we enter Los Angeles in the year 2019 as envisioned by Bay as a series of skyward collisions and exploding buildings. This is when the movie either escalates into high gear for Bay aficionados or disintegrates into a morass of action set pieces, though granted, Bay's use of giant metal spools as terrorizing traffic devices is genuine good fun. Unfortunately though, I am still of the latter camp, and shame on me for having any higher expectation for this sort of popcorn filler. The overstylized cinematography of Mauro Fiore, which smacks of new millennium commercials on upscale product placement, is another dead giveaway.<br/><br/>Out of his Obi-Wan Kenobi guise, McGregor can get rather unctuous as a leading man, especially when the clone confronts his Scottish-accented antecedent, an obviously direct cousin to his smarmy Catcher Block in Peyton Reed's ""Down With Love"". Johansson is certainly luscious enough for her part, though she is not called upon to use her penetrating intelligence by any means. It's also disheartening to see a scene where she reacts emotionally to her duplicate within the actress's famous Calvin Klein ad. Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou play the parts of the scientist and his chief mercenary with predictable malice, though the latter has some unexplained epiphany toward the end. There is an extended cameo by Steve Buscemi, which is welcome at that point of the story though it's rather anachronistic and overly convenient. The ending is a bit of a bore given all that has come before, but it doesn't really matter, as Bay has concocted a movie that should please most of his fans and may even recruit a few new ones."

This must have been what the marketing executives said when they conceived of this film, that is more of a LONG commercial than a movie. Okay, I'm aware of product placement in films. We've all grown up and seen it. Most of the time it's easy to ignore, but this film's cinematographer must be the king of product pushing. Just about every scene begins with a closeup on a featured product and spends several seconds lingering upon it. Couple that with the size of a movie screen and a beer can becomes the size of Godzilla! These advertisers must have said to each other ""Sci-Fi films are hot right now. Let's use that as the vehicle and jam as many products in there as we can."" I could write the whole list of product that I remember from the film, but I don't want to spoil it for everyone (please, sense my sarcasm here).<br/><br/>As for the plot, it has an interesting premise, but there are so many holes in its execution, I wonder how people can actually think this is a great film? If you're interested in sci-fi, see classics like Blade Runner (director's cut), Logan's Run, White Dwarf, Brazil, Gattaca, or Star Wars 4, 5, or 6. If you like action, rent any of the Die Hard series or The Long Kiss Goodnight. When Blade Runner pushed Coke, it was done in a creative way by showing advertising in the future. It didn't detract from the film. Please save your money and don't waste your time on this garbage. At least you can mute the commercials when you watch TV.<br/><br/>My rating is a 1 because of the decent cast and good acting (I guess the advertisers could afford to throw a lot of money at the excellent cast). I refuse to encourage the making of these kinds of films and shame on the people who enable this. I guess the world is going the way of Demolition Man where every restaurant in the future is a Taco Bell. By the way, Demolition Man is also in the mix as a film to see if you want to laugh. It's sci-fi that makes fun of itself. Other films like this are Sleeper and Galaxy Quest. My point is there are so many better films than The Island. See those instead. If you simply must see something on the big screen right now, see Batman Begins or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. You should only see The Island if it's for free or you'll be wanting your $10 back.<br/><br/>A lot the the positive comments I have seen for this film read like a mad lib (fill in actor here, fill in movie here, **insert name** is really hot). If you look at the yahoo comments, there is no history on the reviewer and they don't bother to even do a detailed review.

It also received equal enthusiasm from both the men and women in the audience. I thought the story was very interesting and I liked that it focused so much on the feelings of the characters. But it also was a great action movie with amazing special effects, suspense, humor, a little bit of romance, bad guys and good guys, and yet still a general theme that gives us all something to think about. (The issue of cloning). I enjoyed all of the acting by a very diverse cast. Ewan McGregor shines once again, this time doubly so in his dual roles as a clone and his original. I felt this movie got you involved with the main characters on a personal level and keeps you pulling for them all the way. One or two of the action scenes may be a bit incredible, but I think that if you go in to a movie like this wanting strictly reality, you're missing the point of just sitting back and losing yourself in a bit of emotional fun for a while.

There's also more than passing similarities to ""Coma,"" ""Logan's Run,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Matrix,"" ""Gataca,"" and even ""THX1138,"" among others.

Unlike 'Pearl Harbor', a film that should have seen Bay only tackling 2nd unit directing duties (i.e. action scenes), 'The Island' plays to all of the director's distinctive visual talents, while never allowing him to stray outside his narrative boundaries. Can Michael Bay do intense/suspenseful? Yes! Can he dig into the guts of his characters and find the subtleties and quirks that make for memorable cinema? Absolutely not! But, that's not why moviegoers buy tickets to a Bay flick. Hands down, no one in Hollywood can best Michael Bay's drop-jaw action extravaganza. As long as he's blowing things up, he's unstoppable. What makes 'The Island' so enjoyable is that amidst the amazing action sequences is an original story with compelling characters. The only thing that prevents me from rating 'The Island' as Excellent, is the same ho-hum ending that plagues all of Bay's movies. But then, if we waited for movies with great endings, Hollywood would go bankrupt. 'The Island' is a crowd-pleaser for most of the family, minus the little ones. Some scenes are too intense for youngsters and parents should do their children a favor and go see the flick before they expose anyone under 15 to its dark themes and brutal moments. In closing, 'The Island' works hard for your cinema dollars and hits its mark dead-on. Enjoy!"

"chazzarb","3","1","3","14 June 2019"," Interesting concept, poorly executed
","The film tackles an interesting idea, but approaches it in a superficial way and fails to be at all interesting after the major plot twist (secret) is revealed. From then onwards it turned into a bad sci-fi movie with by-the-books action done much better in many other films.
Many performances in the film are good. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson worked well together, but were let down bad writing - particularly in the last half of the film.
What annoys me about this film is how much better it could have been if it had been written better and the plot did not deteriorate so quickly. It is competent, but still seems like a huge missed opportunity to make something great."
"drqshadow-reviews","4","1","3","6 March 2012"," A Conflicted Picture That Suddenly Trades Ideals for Action and Never Looks Back
","Another sad example of an outright fantastic initial concept that's spoiled by attempts to shoehorn it into a stiff, static action movie formula. Like Paycheck and I am Legend, this works very, very well for as long as it sticks near the premise, but then bursts into a flaming wreck somewhere in the second act and cartwheels absurdly to the finish line. While the getting's good, it's the most I've enjoyed a Michael Bay movie since The Rock - its high production values make for a convincing, well-structured vision of an elegant futuristic lifestyle. Never one for nuance, Bay actually manages to imply something (an unshakable sense that something's just not right) without spelling it out in bright, bold letters for the audience. It's tough not to embrace a vision so seamless, complete and beautiful. But then the other shoe drops, and it lands with a startling thud. Suddenly we've left behind the intellectually challenging modern Logan's Run atmosphere and we're mindlessly running from a faceless gun-toting enemy, a path of fireballs and demolished automobiles in our wake. Bay takes that as a cue to fall back into his old form and trots out an endless supply of jump cuts, violent action sequences, clunky character moments and bold, excessive product placements. The picture straight-up jumps the tracks, bowls over a herd of buffalo, sails off a cliff and erupts before it can hit the ground. A major disappointment, it's worth watching for roughly the first hour."

","This movie was a complete ripoff of the 1979 movie ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"". Except that apparently the writers didn't think all that much of ripping off someone else's idea and not giving them credit, leading to lawsuits and hilarity.<br/><br/>Of course, this being Hollywood, they engaged in a lot of sanitizing that gave it a happier ending and made the concept less horrifying. (Clones are grown full grown rather than being raised from babies.) But the premise is so similar the ripoff was obvious. A farm is growing clones to serve as backup organs for the rich, powerful and famous. Ewan McGregor plays both the clone and the jerk he's serving to back up. So the first half of the movie is pretty much straight ripoff.<br/><br/>The second half is dumbed down, action movie schlock, like we've come to expect from Michael Bay.<br/><br/>But what irritates me is that they sanitized the ending. In the original, it's a rather dark ending, the hero is recaptured, harvested for his heart and the rest of him is put on ice for other organ transplants. His girlfriend is lobotomized. In this one, they survive their donors and McGregor takes over the other guy's life.<br/><br/>Okay, the original was made on the cheap and not very good actors. But it had a message about how science can be used for evil. This one, meh, we need a happy ending. It's Ewan McGregor."

But when it finally answers those questions it poses many more interesting ethical and moral questions ... and then ignores them all for the rest of the movie in favour of increasingly over the top action sequences. The film tries to convince you that it has deep questions about the ethics of science and the morality of slavery. And to be fair, it does have these questions - although they are very muddled and never really stated - but what it does not have is any answers. At all. It can't even answer several large plot holes, including some of the dumbest security guards ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>So all that remains, as the plot gets off the ride at forty minutes and tells the rest of the movie to carry on without it, are the action sequences. None of which are thrilling or exciting, most of which are derivative, and at least one of which is ... wait, this is a Micheal Bay film. That's the best way to sum up the action sequences; it's Michael Bay. If you like his action movies, my advice is to fast forward the first forty minutes and then start watching for some average action but no thrills. If you're looking for a movie with smarts, or with a plot, or even a movie that fakes them, look elsewhere."

"robert-temple-1","10","1","3","15 May 2008"," Spectacularly successful sci fi drama dealing with big issues
","I think we should call Michael Bay 'Docking' Bay, as he docked this one so successfully. This really is an achievement of the first order. It isn't that easy to make a good big budget sci fi film in the first place, but to make one which isn't just entertainment but also has important things to say, and actually says them successfully, is really something! This film features a wonderful performance by Ewan McGregor, who excels himself (or himselves). Scarlett Johanson as the girl does really well, but there is less for her to do, and so she could have been another actress. Naturally, we all like looking at Scarlett Johansson, so that's OK then. Sean Bean does a brilliant job as the creepy doctor. This film lifts every hair on the back of your neck, and it might take them a long time to settle back again. (It might be possible to sue for back-of-neck-baldness. But it would have to be a class action, as there must be so many victims.) The story is so carefully crafted and well-executed, that is works as well as could be imagined. The scenes where large groups stand around in ecstasy waiting to win the lottery to go to the island are a serious social comment on today's society, where we have all been reduced to passive viewers who hope to win something, but are not prepared to go out and get it. Well, Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are prepared to go out and get plenty, and this film moves right along, and gets tenser and tenser and tenser and tenser, and really you think the celluloid has got to break soon, or your DVD will blow up your set. Don't watch it to relax, and drink your beer before it starts, because if you are holding a can, it will be bound to be crushed and you won't even know you've done it. That is, if you're one of those. Or even if you're not. - Be ready! The Island beckons. Can you meet the challenge?"

The story, the acting, the music, the cinematography, the direction in general! The story is really intriguing and interesting; the acting is very good by Scarlett Johansson and Ewan McGregor, but Djimon Hounsou and Sean Bean are even slightly more amazing. The music composed by Steve Jablonsky is amazing and fits very well with the movie. The cinematography is also brilliant. It's amazing how much beauty can be found in this film. Respect for the director Michael Bay! I liked all his previous films too, but this one is even better! I heard that it didn't do so well at the box office, and I think that's a shame, because I haven't seen many films that are as good and that had such an impact on me. There are many beautiful scenes and the end scene is really excellent. There are 2 véry small negative points: at some moment in the film, the action is a little bit too much and there are a few silly scenes. But these are only very small things that actually do not matter, because, like I said, this is a masterpiece! If you haven't seen it yet, go and see it as soon as possible! You won't be disappointed! Objectively speaking,this film doesn't have a bad rating (6.9/10) but it's still very underrated! If you watch it, try to watch it on an as big screen as possible.

","I was expecting the worst when the movie's producers(?) made several very public comments blaming Ewan and Scarlett for the lack of success at the box office. If I remember correctly, they basically said the two lacked passion and couldn't act. I think they did well and acted within the boundaries of the roles, if you get my meaning. I've seen Ewan in other films and I believe him to be an extremely capable actor. With Scarlett, however, it was the first time I had seen her in anything and I thought she did well...then I saw ""The Black Dahlia!"" She's very beautiful, but can't act worth a lick! After seeing ""Dahlia,"" (which really blew) I realized Scarlett did OK in ""The Island"" because that was her character in the film...an attractive, yet vapid piece of eye-candy. Anyhow, this movie is very enjoyable...lot's of action...and Sean Bean, what a great actor/villain!"
"Minstrelo","5","1","3","15 May 2007"," Weak
","The Island was released to mixed reviews, the positive side of which was assuring us all that this was ""grown-up Bay"" - OK, maybe relative to his previous films, but if this were Bay's first outing, I doubt many would hail it as ""grown-up"" per se. The problem with these glowing, relative to expectations reviews is that this is the guy who brought as the Bad Boys series and Armageddon. The latter, Bay no doubt felt was as grown-up as grown-up can be.<br/><br/>So the film displays a pretty notable, though not necessarily bankable, cast of respected actors, the leads being Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson. The difficulty in assessing the quality of their performances lies in the construction of their characters. Only the real life version of McGregor's character is shown, whereas we only see Scarlett Johansson as the clone. My initial reaction was that her performance was less than stellar, awkward, silly, then it turns out she's playing a clone (we don't find out straight away) with the mental age somewhere in the early to mid teens, as is McGregor. In light of this, I was impressed by her performance. McGregor also, who was was amusingly playing a clone of a character who seemed to very sharply resemble, well, Ewan McGregor! Which is all very confusing, but essentially the only poor performance on show was that of Mr. Sean Bean, playing the man in charge of the clone facility, who was particularly stiff, which would've been less bothersome if he were merely a slimy businessman, toying with disposable life for the sake of keeping his clients happy, but his role is elevated to that of the God-complex control freak with some weird sense of paternal pride over the clones.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi is decent playing some good ole' boy transposed from Bad Boys universe to this impersonal brave new world of the future. Djimon Hounsou plays a mercenary hired to track down the clones when they escape, who develops and or rather puts to use a dormant conscience and aids them against their masters, as this parallels his own plot-thickening back-story of slavery.<br/><br/>As you'd custom, much expensive-looking equipment are destroyed, and many a city street is laid to waste. The future LA looks much like present-day LA, 'cept more yellow and, after that bizarre futuristic cliché, more formal. We know that Bay means this to mirror a society where conformity has reached a heretofore unseen pinnacle, and we guess that Bay dislikes this superficially Utopian wasteland vision because he blows a lot of it up and the colours are so saturated to be sickening, but then he's done much the same in all his previous films, all set in the present day. I find it a little difficult to believe that Bay really despises this vision, when his films have displayed such superficiality and, to date, he has yet to render a single character that was anything more than an ugly caricature.<br/><br/>The best action scenes take place in the initial attempted break-out, when McGregor begins to learn the horrors of his situation. When things move outside, the action reaches ridiculousness almost surpassing any previous Bay movie, with the lead characters swinging off electrical letters on the sides of skyscrapers, and fall through a series of conveniently placed buffers. The tension after this is pretty much non-existent, as you can pretty much guess that the characters having undergone these sorts of trials will not be offed, and in particular we never suspect for a second that Bay will kill off Johansson when she's looking as perfect as she is.<br/><br/>All in all, a mildly distracting film mish-mashing any number of sci-fi films, most notably Logan's Run and Blade Runner, that touches on ethical issues of cloning and its potential uses, but the problem with this attempt at a humanist film is that Bay relies on bringing the issues to a kind of boiling point, so the message of man's natural desire to be free in spite of the luxuries promised in captivity is confused because the captive clones are given the option of death or freedom, not paradise or freedom, so we get no clear message to this end, and we are meant to be less sympathetic to the non-clone McGregor, with his natural instinct for survival at any cost. The line, to me, is not as clear as Bay paints it."
"Benjamin_Cox","6","1","3","27 March 2007"," Schizonphrenic sci-fi actioner that ultimately disappoints - 62%
","Ever since ""Minority Report"" brought the science back into sci-fi, there seems to be a shift away from the mindless dross that has plagued us for the last few years into more thought-provoking, intelligent dramas. However, director Michael Bay is not known for thought-provoking or intelligent films and at least he has a real go with this. But sometimes mixing brawn with brains isn't necessarily the way to go and I do feel that this film is part water and part oil. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays Lincoln Six Echo, a young man living in a strange community where everyone wears the same clothes and there is a ""Big Brother"" thing going on. Aside from being utterly suppressed in every way, Lincoln's only respite comes in the beautiful form of Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) and his jittery companion Jones Three Echo (Ethan ""Nelix"" Phillips). Told that the outside world has been contaminated, their sole aim is to win the lottery prize of going to the Island - the last contamination-free part of the world - and repopulating the human race. Sounds good, right? Only Lincoln isn't so sure and desperate to uncover the truth, he finds that the god-like Dr Merrick (Sean Bean) has more terrible secrets than he ever imagined, forcing Lincoln and Jordan to go on the run.<br/><br/>To say any more would give the game away but needless to say, the plot twists one way and another. The film certainly looks the business though I'd like to think that the future is more advanced than hovering trains, flying highways and relentless product placement. McGregor and Johansson provide a solid leading pair but once the story really gets going, it's almost as though they lose enthusiasm. When the action kicks in, the characters seem to take a back seat as the whole thing descends into car chases and gun fights. Oh dear. Bay's instinct for action remains undiminished (he even recreates the car chase from ""Bad Boys 2"", substituting cars for train wheels) but it doesn't really fit in with what has gone before it. In truth, the action didn't really get the blood pumping as one would have hoped - in fact, the closest my heart came to skipping a beat was when you first see the Cadillac Cien concept car and that was largely due to excess speeds racing the thing on ""Gran Turismo 4"" on my PS2.<br/><br/>And ultimately, this is the problem with ""The Island"". It takes a long time to get going and when it does, it never fully engages with the viewer. While it doesn't do anything wrong, it never really stretches itself to the degree you'd hope it would. Personally, I felt that the scenes before the chase begins were actually the strongest and there was still much to explore in that regard instead of resorting to tired action clichés that Bay knows off by heart. Instead of creating a credible and commendable sci-fi film, Bay spends the whole film trying to make another ""Bad Boys"" but then again, what did you expect from the director of the cursed ""Armageddon""? This could have been something special but in the end, chalk up yet another wasted opportunity. Ho-hum."

"Jackie-Kennedy","10","1","3","6 March 2007"," The Island...thrilling, intelligent and thought-provoking
","As we head towards the end of the first decade of the 21st Century it is worth taking a look back at the last say 100 years to see how far we've come. From a world without cures for even the most simple of diseases we are now finding ways of not just mending our bodies but actually replacing that damaged parts with new perfect organs or limbs. At the moment however it is only body parts, non-living items we are concerned with. We are still experimenting with idea of actually cloning a person. a human embryo. There are still issues of ethics to be dealt with. The Island then gives us fascinating, if a little unnerving insight, into what the future could hold for this new area of science and the hugely sensitive issue such developments could raise.<br/><br/>Set a little over 10 years into the future the film centers around an underground 'decontamination'facility run by the ruthless Dr.Merrik(Sean Bean on fine form as always). The inhabitants are a large ( and ever expanding) group of men and women who, the facility's staff would have them believe, the last survivors or a global contamination that makes living outside impossible. The 'survivors' are to are forced to remain underground living out their lives in a fairly routine way. The only way they can leave, so we are told, is by winning 'The Lottery' a draw which takes place weekly in which the lucky winners is allowed to leave and go to live on...you guessed it....The Island, the only uncontaminated place left on earth.<br/><br/>While most of the inhabitants, who are as a rule very simple people with simple lives, are happy to wait , one is becoming restless. Lincoln-6-Echo(Ewan McGregor) is convinced that something is not right, believes there is more going on than simply waiting to go to the Island and , despite Dr.Merrik's best efforts to convince him otherwise,decides to take the matter into his own hands, by doing the unthinkable, leaving the confines of the facility and going up top. In the process of doing so he learns the terrible truth.<br/><br/>The 'survivors' are in fact clones. In the time when this is set the rich have begun to follow a trend of paying to themselves cloned and what this facility provides are essentially insurance policies, whereby you pay a huge amount of money to have yourself cloned. This provides you with everything from new limbs and organs to a carrier for your baby.<br/><br/>As far as the customer is concerned, however, the clone remains in vegetative state for the duration of it's existence. And Merrik , since what he is doing breaks several laws and because of the huge profit he makes, intends to keep it that way.So when Lincoln and his friend Jordan-Two-Delta( Scarlett Johanssen)make a break for it and set out to find their donors and reveal the truth he will stop at nothing to prevent them from doing so.<br/><br/>This film has just about everything going for it. The cast is stellar. Ewan McGregor, it seems, can turn his hand to just about anything, be it a Jedi Master, a young Poet or a Clone. He portrays Lincoln's confusion and restlessness with ease as well as his fear when he learns the truth. Scarlett Johanssen has really been making her presence felt in Hollywood and this is no exception. As Jordan she is sweet and innocent but yet intelligent. Perfect. As I have a soft spot for Sean Bean I can't say a bad thing about him but he really plays the villain well. He is cold calculating and yet projects something else too...guilt perhaps or unsureness as to what he is doing? I'm not sure but it's there and I like it. A superb support cast of clones and facility personnel helps steer the film.<br/><br/>The actual premise of the film is highly original and very well maintained through-out. It is very believable because we are in a time where cloning is foremost among the issues being dealt with in Medicine circles as well as being debating for moral, ethical and other standpoints. It doesn't require a huge stretch of the imagination to imagine something similar to this occurring 10, 20 years down the line. It is a reality that we need to think about. We're not there yet but we are close.In this way it gets you thinking more than many movies can.<br/><br/>There as some thrilling chase scenes and intense emotional drama as Lincoln and Jordan begin to discover their human natures and come face to face with Lincoln's donor, Tom Lincoln, an adventurer type(also McGregor). All in all the film hits all the right spots and leaves an impression on you as it forces you to contemplate issues that effect us each individually and as a whole.<br/><br/>10/10 *****"

","For the first hour or so of this movie, it stays on track with a logically developed science fiction story that even introduces an exploration of an ethics issue that will soon face society. It's told in the classic '70's style of negative utopias of the near future. Much of the artificial society the main characters exist in is illustrated quite expertly for the audience.<br/><br/>A ""lottery"" is eagerly anticipated by the inhabitants of a domed shelter, where they receive a ""get-out-of-here-free"" card to a beautiful south seas island. It is an oasis on Earth, a Shangri-La dreamed by everyone, free from a contamination that obliterated most of the life outside the enclosed world we see. But, the plot releases traces of evidence that ""something's not quite right here."" The audience learns the truth with the characters, never knowing more than they do.<br/><br/>But as the second chapter opens with an escape attempt, the usual Michael Bay is released from restraint, and the CGI explosion fest begins. High speed chases, characters operating vehicles they've never seen before, explosions, gun play, people falling from skyscrapers (and surviving!), buildings collapsing, etc. are all offered through the magic of overused CGI chaos. Of course, this is all topped off with a shooting death captured in ""bullet time"" slow-mo, so you can watch the projectile enter the victim's vital organs.<br/><br/>After this, the film limps toward the finish with more such nonsense. This movie had potential; an updated exploration of genetic science first examined in Logan's Run, Brave New World, and other stories. In the end, it falls short of those, by resorting to mayhem and violence."

","Yep, it's better than Armageddon, Bad Boys II and Pearl Harbor, which isn't very hard to pull off. It's no where near the level of The Rock. The first half of the movie is a fascinating look at a future utopia where people are kept safe from a post apocalyptic world where one island is a safe place for the survivors, of whom if you win a lottery you'll get to leave the utopia to live on the island. However, all is not well in this place and some people are getting suspicious about what this place is, why new people keeping showing up after an apocalypse and so on.<br/><br/>Eventually two of them escape and find out that there was no apocalypse and they are clones of rich people who will use them as an organ bank when the time comes for it. That's when things go wrong for this movie. After this it's just a big loud action flick that doesn't do anything new or creative. Basically anyone who's seen enough movies can guess what will happen after this point.<br/><br/>I liked the way it takes place about 15 years from now and looks like it could be happening at that point. The technology of the future looks realistic for that far in to the future. So that's one good point.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, all the clones escape and the bad guy dies. I was disappointed the movie ended at that point. I think it would be interesting to see how the clones who lived in an isolated environment for all their lives would react to the real world. I'd like to see how the rest of the world deals with and reacts to the fact that all the rich and famous people have exact clones running around. I just think that this specific story had more interesting topics that could have been covered but weren't."

There were just too many instances where they eluded a disastrous death by sheer luck. This was a very good example of a film telling rather than showing. The conversation between Lincoln and Jordan when he told her that the island didn't exist seemed like it was a convenient transition to their escape into the real world for the rest of this too-long-for-its-own-good film. And the final scene where all of the clones were escaping out of the underground world was eerie and cliché. It's the kind of movie that has to be watched again to be understood, but I don't think I could sit through it one more time. And isn't Steve Buscemi always playing the cynical weirdo in every film?"
"RandyL712","3","1","3","17 June 2006"," ""Isle"" be skipping a second viewing of this excessive rerun
","I paused the movie at 1:11 to answer the phone. At this point, I was enjoying the movie. It was a brilliant vision of the future, cinematographically speaking, and the sets and costuming was well done. The style evoked ""Gattica"" and ""Minority Report"", with a little bit of the quirkiness we all loved in ""12 Monkeys"".<br/><br/>The rest went downhill. The chase scenes were repetitive, unrealistic and relentless. (How could the enemy constantly find our heroes within 30 seconds?) The effects were terrific. The ""wasp"" flying sport bikes were amazing, and the highway chase was just awesome. However, it went on, and on, and it seemed I had transformed into a remake of ""THX 1138"", which is _not_ a compliment.<br/><br/>I won't give anything away, but the end scene is silly. People unaware of things seem to instantly understand EVERYTHING although they were provided no explanation of reality.<br/><br/>The worst part, by far, was the obnoxious product placement. Every prop was bought and paid for. It wasn't a beer, it was a futuristic BUDWEISER. It wasn't a cop car, it was a 30 minute ad for the 2005 Dodge Charger and Magnum. It wasn't a sports car, it was the new Cadillac concept car. (and Cadillac SRX got plenty of on-screen time too). I'm surprised the shirts didn't have huge HANES logos on them. I was wondering when they'd zoom in on the guns to show the SMITH & WESSON imprint. Why was everything out of 2005 in a movie set 'after 2050' ? It was really obvious, very poorly done, and really distracting. Of course, I'm enjoying NACHO DORITOS as I write this review ... ;-) All in all, I left this movie annoyed, and with a bad taste in my mouth. I LOVE science fiction movies, and this was just a very, very disappointing movie. It was 30 minutes too long at 2:15, followed much the path you'd expect, and although the overall concept was intriguing, they must have left the good dialogue on the cutting room floor."

","The product placement in this film is blatant and quite astonishing. At one point Johanssen watches incredulously -- like us -- a re-run of her famous monochrome TV ad for Mr Kline. This cynical two fingers at the viewer is a hanging offence in my book. Waiting to spot the next 'big name' distracts from this supermarket-fare, 'buy-one-get-one-free' story of the good guys and the bad guys racing to catch up with your usual Romeo and Juliet couple on the run. Transfer the glossy futuristic scenery and bog standard car chases to downtown LA or New York or even Brixton on a Saturday night and you'd be watching the same tired story. There are reverberating echos here of 'Logan's Run' and 'Coma.' McGregor out-planks K Reeves, whilst Scarlett 'pouty' Johansson glows breathtakingly but has only two emotional expressions which she uses alternately, hoping, no doubt, that no-one has noticed she can't actually act. The truncated final scene said it all: Let's get out of here, back to the real world. Let's have a Coke and a Colonel Kentucky and make the world a better place in which to stroll in our Calvin Kline jeans. Let's surf the net using MSN, surrounded by the stench of capitalism.

"LivingDog","10","1","3","26 January 2006"," A Movie For The Ages (pun intended)
","I saw this movie because no others were on cable that seemed like a scifi. This is not a scifi per se (this is not exactly a scifi). What it is is a thought provoking action filled brilliantly directed, edited, cast, written movie about ... cloning. It takes the question of human cloning to a new height and brings it right up to your face.<br/><br/>Sounds boring? YOU BET! That's what I thought - but it is anything but! Directed by Mr. Michael Bay Writing credits (WGA) Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci (screenplay) As I will always say, a great movie has to be great in all categories - from editing to directing - and this one is just that. I wholly expected a sequence of utterly boring chase scenes with ""cute guy"" and ""handsome chick"" ... or is it the other way around? I forget, Hollywood is so terrible these days. However, the acting in all the roles was so well played I forgot I was watching a movie and got involved in the lives of these people. Kudos to the _entire_ cast as well to Casting.<br/><br/>Acting:<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor .... Lincoln Six Echo/Tom Lincoln<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson .... Jordan Two Delta/Sarah Jordan<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou .... Albert Laurent<br/><br/>Sean Bean .... Merrick<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi .... McCord<br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan .... Starkweather<br/><br/>APPLAUSE!!! APPLAUSE!!! ENCORE!!! ENCORE!!!<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor: always puts in a great role - he allows to slip gently into his character's situation. Wonderful. I will look for any movie he does in the future. E.g. I didn't recognize him from his other roles, but found his name on the Star Wars roster - amazing - THAT's WHO HE IS!?!?! wow! (I have a new appreciation for real actors such as Mr. McGregor because of Mr. Tom Cruise's inability to do anything other than look pretty, which I discovered from his payroll job in ""War of the Worlds: the ruining of an American Classic into an emotionless nothing."")<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson: I don't understand, nor like, Hollywood's perpetual casting of blondes with big appendages in the lead female roles. However, like Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider, Ms. Scarlett Johansson (who plays Jordan 2 Delta - great names!) is utterly convincing in every scene she plays. I applaud her - in every scene she stopped being a ""pretty face"" and always performed as a real person in a real situation. Wonderful. Ms. Johansson is wonderful as she natural as she is beautiful. It is hard to believe that Hollywood found a ""beautiful blonde"" who can also have such strong acting ability. I hope Hollywood doesn't ignore her for her acting talent.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou: a walking wall with perfect on screen presence. He was who he played - from the SEAL Team leader to the de-humanized son of a freedom fighter. His character's focus and determination was palpable. Again, another actor to look for in any movie he makes.<br/><br/>Sean Bean: totally, 100% convincing as he brought that sociopathic god-complex doctor to life. You want to reach through the screen and ... *breath* ... he really played the part up. There's a scene where Merrick (Bean) is talking to Laurent (Hounsou) where Merrick's persona leaps off of the big screen and you see him for what he truly is - give Mr. Bay, Mr. Bean's make-up artist, and Mr. Bean a standing-O for bring that to the foreground at a precise moment. Wonderful.<br/><br/>Steve Buscemi: enough personality to dominate and sustain the entire movie. I can't forget any of Mr. Buscemi's roles. He is so magnificent in all of them - anytime he is in a movie I watch the movie just to see him... if the movie that is made around him is good, then so much the better. If it isn't ... then I got to see Mr. Buscemi in another role - it's a win-win! :)<br/><br/>Michael Clarke Duncan: every appearance, no matter how small, he manages to bring to life with his giant heart. In Armageddon as ""Bear,"" in The Green Mile as ""John Coffey"" (wow!), The Whole Nine Yards as ""Franklin 'Frankie Figs' Figueroa,"" (great!) in Planet of the Apes as ""Colonel Attar,"" (THE ONLY ACTOR WORTH WATCHING IN THAT TIM BURTON MESS THEY SHOULD BURN THE MASTER!!!)and in The Island as ""Starkweather."" Mr. Duncan should get bigger roles - am I the only person who sees this?<br/><br/>This is a rare cast - this is a rare director - this is a movie for the ages!<br/><br/>11/10<br/><br/>-Zafoid<br/><br/>PS: I am not a fan of directors at all - there are some who make good movies who I would definitely go see, but only Mr. Michael Bay is worth looking for! I am now a ""Michael Bay fan."" The next time I see a new movie I will LOOK FOR his name... if he directed it I will see it. I was only willing to do this with one other director - Stanley Kubrik. I think if Mr. Kubrik was alive today, he would applaud Mr. Bay's magnificent gift to direct.<br/><br/>PPS: I know how to take photos... I take the picture in my head ahead of time... Mr. Bay said the same thing about his movies - he knows what he is doing. Fledgling directors take note - learn from Mr. Michael Bay - a future American Master.<br/><br/>-Z"

","I really wanted to enjoy this movie because I liked the plot premise and the little snippets of the story that I had seen in the media. But Michael Bay has a way of filming action movies that is unimaginative and predictable. This movie follows the same Hollywood clichés that we have seen hundreds of times. Add to that the completely gratuitous product placement that makes the entire movie a big advert and you will understand why this movie was more than underwhelming at the box office. <br/><br/>This movie is proof that Hollywood has lost its edge with blockbusters, and that the true innovation lies elsewhere. Unless producers and directors stop taking the movie viewer for granted, the summer blockbuster will die."

This is indicated by Lincon 6-echo's line, ""I don't know, but I want one."" Tom Lincoln, the sponsor of 6-echo, acts more like a 15 year old than 6-echo.<br/><br/>What's the point of the gratuitous sex scene after Tom Lincoln's death? This is the definition of gratuitous sex scene.<br/><br/>This is a very poor rip-off of ""Logan's Run"" and direct lifts straight from ""Code 46"" (which is a much better movie).<br/><br/>DO NOT rent it!

","It just isn't true that movie failures move swiftly to video. Quite the opposite. The Island was perhaps the biggest and quickest flop of 2005, and along with the excellent Cinderella Man, they moved slowly to video. The Island was made to look like a rip-off of ABC'S hit series LOST, but in fact is nothing like it. Indeed there is no island in the film until the final few seconds. The film presents a Liberal Democrat's Dream World, in which human cloning is taken to the degree that hundreds of clone-humans are made in a secret laboratory, to be carved up when Limousine Liberals with much money and no conscience needs a liver or a kidney. When a clone disappears, they say he's won the lottery and gets to go to an island paradise with unlimited sex et cetera. A total absence of God and morality permeates the story, except when a few ""defective"" clones start getting real human traits like curiosity and conscience. A mildly entertaining chase involving the customary special effects excess is somewhat offset by watching Scarlet Johansen. Speaking of conscience or lack thereof, the movie was made by Michael Bey. He's the guy who trashed the military heroes of World War II with his awful and unpatriotic ""Pearl Harbor"" -- in which the Japanese attack on America was ""justified"" in the film's opening minutes; this rewrite of history to (according to the studio) improve box office in Japan."

"perfect_circle21","4","1","3","15 August 2005"," Pearl Habour sucked...and this does too
","The first 1/3 of the Island was pretty enjoyable stuff. An interesting (if familiar) dystopian set up with McGregor & Johansson as confused inhabitants of a strange community. <br/><br/>Anyone who has seen the trailer has a sense of 'where have I seen this before?' about the look and the premise. Michael Bay aims at making something very similar to Minority Report, with little touches of the Matrix but ends up making a longer version of John Woo's terrible 'Paycheck'. Like 'Paycheck' (with Uma Thurman) good actors are put to waste with a laugh out loud bad script. We know the two main leads can act up a storm, but with a weak script both look embarrassing and unconvincing. No wonder the producers are slagging them off for it.<br/><br/>In supporting roles Steve Buscemi and Sean Bean are similarly wasted. The fact that we have to put up with yet another British bad guy in a Hollywood flick is another negative mark against the film.<br/><br/>When The Island goes into full on chase mode after the initial set up it begins a steady decline. The chase scenes are nauseating to watch, handy cam shots that genuinely make you feel ill. There are attempts at humour and romance (which fail) and the whole film drags on past the 2 hour mark when it could have easily sewn the story up much sooner.<br/><br/>Oh and the film also features one of the biggest clichés in film history. The scene where the characters are viewing video camera footage, they spot something and go ""Hey! Wait a minute. Rewind that tape...enlarge that area. I knew it!"" An unnecessary and pointless movie. In the word of Team America, ""Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"""

The clones await their turn to be called to the Island through a lottery.<br/><br/>That (Ewan McGregor)Lincoln Six Echo and (Scarlett Johansson) Jordan Two Delta would eventually outsmart Laurant and his system is consistent with human nature. The fall of any autocrat comes from taking a big clomp on the Big Lie he preaches.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending but I'm not sure that conforms with my understanding of human nature.

"Chris_Docker","5","1","3","11 August 2005"," The Island is an opportunity wasted, in an ocean of talent and opportunity
","For a dedicated sci-fi fan, The Island is necessary nourishment. But what is there for a wider audience? Ewan McGregor starts questioning his environment, the general belief that everyone he sees on a day to day basis has been saved from a contaminated planet, that they are the 'lucky' ones being prepared to go to the Island, an uncontaminated last haven, where they will start a new Eden. His friend Scarlett Johansson is less questioning but is good at recognising lying in his facial expression. The truth gradually unfolds, interspersed with several high speed chases and reasonably convincing future landscapes.What turns out to be a decent plot is made overlong, and as there is so little time to build detail into a fairly mammoth story, it is easy to lose interest. Lame direction (from the guy who brought us Pearl Harbor) and pedestrian acting doesn't help matters, however inventive some of the explosions. Steve Buscemi almost rescues things as the hapless engineer bridging two worlds, but Johansson is cast well below her abilities and McGregor - instead of stretching his acting talents - stretches nothing more than his good looks to play himself yet again. The 2hrs+ finds plenty of room to squeeze in plot holes and clichés, but in a sea of talent and opportunities, The Island remains, sadly, an opportunity wasted."

"ugn","8","1","3","4 August 2005"," half and half
","This film is a mixed bag. It starts off as a futuristic thriller, well paced and measured. I found myself captivated by the pace of the plot development, as the ripple of main character's unease in the too clean and clinical world he lives in slowly gets stronger and he discovers more and more cracks in the reality presented to him until it culminates in the realization of his suspicions. That is the first part of the movie. From there the pace lifts instantaneously into action and doesn't slow down until the end of the movie. For the first couple of minutes this feels forced due to sudden change but it proceeds in standard Hollywood action mold so it doesn't take long to get used to. The second half of the movie is in a 'near future' world and the action is fast and furious till the end. Visually the film is engaging, full of textured closeups and color filters and, in the second half, lots of special effects. I could have done with less camera shaking during the action scenes, sometimes I thought it substituted for special effects as in parts it is hard to see whats going on. The dialog is snappy with a few traditional gags through the action moments. Ewen McGregor is very good in the role and so is Scarlett Johansson although she is underused in the movie. The film is very entertaining but a little thin, mostly due to the second half being very formula. A little more plot substance could have been good there. Overall: good, entertaining viewing. PS: When Steve Buscemi's character talks to Johansson's character about memories I had a major deja-vu to ""Blade Runner"" scene where Harrison Ford's character talks to Sean Young's character about memories. The scenes to me feel so similar."

When I first heard about it I was torn: I am not a Michael Bay fan but I adore Ewan McGregor and think Scarlet J. is a fine actor as well. When I realized Jerry Bruckheimer wasn't involved I thought perhaps this flick has half a chance. <br/><br/>I thought it was a great summer popcorn movie. It definitely has some deeper levels than just a bunch of action. Yes there are certain themes that have been visited in other movies but at this point if you get remotely close to the topic of the future, cloning, utopia, you are going to overlap with other stories. <br/><br/>There is a pretty good plot and set-up before you get to the big action sequences. It was nice that it wasn't run, fight, explode the whole movie. They did a good job of explaining most of the implausible things and I could overlook some of the plot holes, which weren't too bad.<br/><br/>My only criticism is the insane amount of product placement. It was ""Wayne's World"" caliber placement. I read on a message board that perhaps it was ironic that they are products and they are exposed to all these products and marketing. Maybe. But it was annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>The acting was great, the effects were good. This movie deserves to make more money than it has. And Ewan McGregor is gorgeous.

"alferik","9","1","3","1 August 2005"," Excellent action/scifi-thriller
","Nevermind Michael Bay's notoriety in social Hollywoodlife, never mind The Islands surprisingly uneventful opening weekend domestically in North America - The Island is a definite must-see at the movies (or at the very least buy on DVD).<br/><br/>I commend it first and foremost for a brilliant science-fiction story, that touches on real-life contemporary political eugenics-, stem cell research- and cloning issues. Although the movie demands a certain level of suspension of disbelief (notably as regards where any form of governmental/federal surveillance authority might have been, allowing such a large-scale business within a controversial branch to operate unethically and decidedly in severe penal code violation, in enormous facilities, without intervening), it provides a very interesting and stimulating contribution to the ongoing evolution of our thought-process as concerns these very substantial and literally vital political and cultural issues.<br/><br/>I certainly was also very fascinated by the very elaborate designs, incredible cinematography (something akin to Mr. & Mrs Smith), futuristic urban images to rival Bladerunner, Minority Report and The 5th Element (I'm serious!) and thoroughly intelligent, but not (thankfully) overly intellectualized and artsy screenplay.<br/><br/>The film to some extent also invokes associations to (the original) The Matrix, and several other seminal movies from later years. Again, this IS a must see. Difference between this film and many other big-budget futuristic and/or philosophical concept movies, is that it better than most balances well between too radical, contrived and grave future visions (The Matrix, Minority Report) on the one hand, and too ridiculous and theatrical (artsy) effort (5th Element and many more) on the other.<br/><br/>But heck, I'm an earthly male, I'm alive and kicking and I don't have (hopefully) too many intellectual hang-ups, so even the added bonus of seeing Scarlett Johansson looking better than ever before, would be enough to sell the movie to a relatively simple soul as myself. Thank you, Michael Bay - I appreciate your male chauvinist talents, so you can't be too bad! ;) Scarlett Johansson always looked very good, but in this movie she looks even better than Charlize Theron, and I've never noticed that before :) I could also identify well with both characters played by Ewan McGregor, and all other characters were very believable as well. Lots of great acting throughout, and Steve Buscemi provides comic relief as well as he ever has - which in my view says quite a lot! As it happens, I am not from North America, and the marketing where I live - Bergen, Norway - was neither confusing, bungled or too thin. I saw it in a packed auditorium in a screening commencing at about 23.00 (or 11 pm, if you may) - on a Sunday night! And I did not hear one single complaint from anyone on the way out, which is rather seldom as Norwegian audiences usually are about as critically minded as any audience, but I suspect that, as with War of the Worlds, people were to a great extent still too consumed by the emotional impact of the film (or just the sheer freaked-out-ness of having seen a somewhat realistic nightmare vision of a society in the not-too-distant future that embraces genetic engineering and cloning all out) to be all that chatty.<br/><br/>As for me, I was partly freaked out, partly thoroughly action-ridden and partly on cloud 9 - my head filled with blissful images of a Scarlett looking better than ever :) No wonder Woody Allen calls her his new big muse.<br/><br/>(Hey, why don't someone make a remake of Gone with the Wind, where Johansson can play Scarlett O'Hara? She'd be the best woman in the role ever, and she wouldn't even have to get accustomed to a new forename for the role... ;)"
"wklau","8","1","3","31 July 2005"," Best Michael Bay movie since The Rock
","With The Island, I can now forgive Michael Bay for making bad movies with good production but weak scripts like Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II. The Island has a much better script, it is a shame that the idea was revealed in the trailer or in the introductory description in newspapers or magazines. If viewers watched them first, they would already know who the protagonists are and the suspense in first act of the movie is actually spoiled.<br/><br/>Though not produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, The Island stills look like Michael Bay's previous movies - well made and highly commercial. As in Bay's previous work, there is not much to criticize in terms of the production. The look and feel of the movie is so good that I had been looking forward to this movie since I saw the trailer. The futuristic world in the movie reminds me of that in Minority Report and looks equally good. The cinematography is spectacular.<br/><br/>What I really like is the story, though it is relatively simple. There were quite a few movies which involve clones, but this movie may be the first one which based totally from the point of view of clones themselves. It is a great premise - clones finding out they are just ""insurance policies"". Though there may be room for more interesting developments, The Island explores the premise well enough given the limited screen time. (The movie's running time is 136 min. and is already longer that the usual 120.) The scripts uses both the differences between the clone and his original (the movie makers even cleverly uses Ewan McGregor's real Scotland accent) and the indistinguishability of them.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie is quite visually different from Bay's previous movies. I thought it was a good new change for Bay and I waited to see how he did with the set. I actually wished the story is based entirely in the futuristic world. But the characters fled and went to L.A. later, the movie went back to Bay's previous style - helicopters, car chases, gunshots and explosions. Luckily this time the action scenes are more creative and cliff-hanging enough. (I really hate the experience in Bad Boys II, it seemed that the car chases would never end.) Ewan McGregor is good in this movie. I have not seen all his work in US but to me this may be his best film since Trainspotting. (Star Wars wasted him and Natalie Portman.) Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson is also good in action movies. I saw her in Lost in Translation (2003) and was not impressed. But she performed well in The Island and looks more beautiful than before. As usual, Michael Bay's direction is slick. He is excellent action film director, what he needs is good scripts. He is just no James Cameron, he's not a writer himself and I wish him keep doing what he does best (directing) and not to do the Pearl Harbor attempt again before he gets a good script. On the whole, The Island is good action movie with an interesting story and is Hollywood movie at its best."

","We start the movie with a precognitive nightmare that our protagonist(Lincoln) is having. This nightmare which is supposed to be fueling Linclon and be the impetus for his quest is never explained, it just is. Which seems to be the theme for the whole movie, it just is.<br/><br/>The basic plot of the movie is: we have Lincoln who feels something is wrong with his world. He finds out some disturbing truths and goes on the run with his lady-friend. They are chased from place to place etc...<br/><br/>The movie borrows heavily from numerous other sources and throws in some chase scenes, explosions, shrapnel and loud noises and hopes we won't notice that this movie sucks. Everything in the entire movie feels wooden and shallow. Many things contribute to the crappiness of this film. For instance the complete lack of character development except for one attempt where a character does a 180 that makes almost no sense and obtains instant redemption. The terror that we are meant to feel never comes through. And the chase scenes were nothing special.<br/><br/>What allowed me to give this film 4/10 is the cohesiveness of the overall plot. Despite some things that don't quite make sense, the plot seems to flow logically and smoothly and the pacing is pretty good.<br/><br/>Overall: This film felt cut and pasted. Save your money!"

I think they did a wonderful job with the casting I couldn't think of any better people to put in it! Some parts of the movie had me on the edge of my seat, and a lot of parts I was laughing. It was a good mixture of everything. It was an excellent movie from beginning to end and i recommend it to everyone who likes action, Drama, Sci-Fi, Thriller, and Futuristic movies! And if your a big Ewan McGregor fan like me, this is just the movie to see!!! He did a wonderful job even the parts where he had to face himself and play two totally different characters! Hats off to Micheal Bay and everyone who helped make this wonderful piece of work!!! 10/10 stars!!!"
"sd0006","9","1","3","27 July 2005"," Very under-rated film; go see it!
","I give a lot of credit to Michael Bay for making this film. It is NOT a brainless action film that simply goes through the motions. A lot of work was put into the back-story, set design, and futuristic gadgetry. And he took a big risk by casting un-Hollywood actors like Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johansson, instead of the low-risk stars like Russell Crowe or Tom Cruise or whatever. Steven Spielberg has his Minority Report, Michael Bay has The Island. I think this movie is a worthy addition to the sci-fi genre, and a Micheal Bay movie wouldn't be complete without incredible action sequences. I might add that Ms. Johansson is particularly hot in this movie! I don't know how well this movie is doing at the box office, but ten years from now this film will still stand out. GO SEE IT!"
"copperclip","9","1","3","27 July 2005"," The Many Uses for Clones
","This movie poses the question: What happens when cloning, to be commercially successful, forces the scientist to make an actual complete human copy? The vegetative clone does not thrive, so the scientists had to produce a living clone--a walk-about product, you might say. And Product is what the clone is--it is owned by its original. Then what does the scientist do with this intelligent-but-naive creature? Well, he dreams up an artificial world, a source from which they have sprung--these clones are survivors from an apocalyptic world--and a background history--implanted memories. It's kind of a Reality Show, a Survivor series, but a little boring for the participants. The scientist, a corporate CEO (Sean Bean, devilishly handsome) in this movie, decides it's best to keep all this a secret; the rest of the world thinks this expensive cloning is vegetative and probably just parts, anyway. Big deal. All is well; the money is rolling in (a Product costs five million American dollars). All is well, that is, until the Product, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), has become inordinately curious. This is where the movie begins.<br/><br/>These Products, the clones, are actually identical twins to their respective owners/originals. Also, think ""non-locality""--as in the movie ""Suspect Zero"" (special features on the DVD). The science and science fiction in this movie are exhilarating. I'm reminded of ""Logan's Run"" and ""Blade Runner"", and that's good company. Plus the traffic accident--or car chase or whatever they're calling such mayhem--is rather unique.<br/><br/>Because the character development is so good, you the viewer are drawn into the clones' dilemma. The most interesting clone is the one who is trying to figure out how the Lottery (win a trip to the Island!) has been rigged--this guy's gotta get a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination--what comic relief! The contrast between the goons who deliver the clones to the operating room and the worker McCord who befriends Lincoln Six Echo (that's Steve Buscemi, another good character actor) is great realism--some people become brutalized by their experience and some become empathic. The responsiveness of Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) to new experiences and the innocence of both leads to the outside world is well done. It's quite believable in terms of how the cloning is done, how clones are utilized and what the clone institution and the outside world look like. There are still biker bars! Yeah! <br/><br/>And why do I call this piece ""The Many Uses of Clones""? Who could have imagined to what use a clone could be put--I shudder to think of what other diabolical uses science could dream up for cloning. This is a major theme of science fiction--what happens when science misuses its knowledge; ""Frankenstein"" by Mary Shelley is considered the first novel to explore this idea. Consider ""The Island"" a cautionary tale, told in great style and conviction."
"maahli","6","1","3","26 July 2005"," Implausible
","The many implausibilities, inconsistencies, not to mention scientific inaccuracies insult the viewer's intelligence. By the time the technology is ready for the successful cloning of humans, scientists should be able to tweak some gene to make clones not have brains. There is no way a clone could ever have the original's memories. A clone is no different from a twin. And if they are engineered to have no interest in sex, why do they need to be kept apart? And why do they end up having sex at all? Why does Jordan have a manicure and plucked eyebrows? How do they get into accident after accident with only the slightest scratch? If they can grow cloned babies in tubes, why do the clones have to give birth them? Why are they taught to read? Why are they allowed to have bacon? Would you want your organ donor to eat bacon? Wouldn't there have been an easier way to get rid of them than to make up that whole Island story?"
"eflemieux","9","1","3","22 July 2005"," Popcorn Heaven :-)
","I didn't believe Michael Bay could come back after making Pearl Harbor (the worst disappointment of my movie watching career)... and god, was I wrong.<br/><br/>This movie is a perfect summer flick. It has action, a story that makes sense, high entertainment and... a babe ;-) More seriously, the story is amazing and the acting is pretty good.<br/><br/>Many reviewers say that The Island is actually two movies stuck together - one, an exploration of a pretty dim universe and the second, a totally run of the mill action flick. I must agree with that. The first half is a very well made exercise in imagination and set design. The second part suffers from terminal Michael Bay-ism - way too many car chases, way too many explosions, way too many ""boooms, bangs and wowwwwwwws"".<br/><br/>Contrary to many summer movies, The Island does NOT require a major suspension of disbelief: the story really makes sense. I'll try to see other movies written by the same team.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. The two principals deliver as well in action scenes than in funny scenes (there are a few :-) Sean Bean plays a variation of his typical bad-guy role but he excels in it. Djimon Hounsou (the other Gladiator :-) is good but he has his ups and lows... Steve Buscemi is, as usual, a genius.<br/><br/>The special effects are... too good? Micheal Bay seems to have mastered the art of milking too much money from producers - the car chases scenes are well made and are obviously expensive but they kinda distract from the story line. Personally, i would have removed a good half of them.<br/><br/>I didn,t notice any major plot holes, besides the fact that the main characters are pretty indestructible... I wouldn't take life insurance on them, it would be a bad bet...<br/><br/>There is a lot of product placement in this movie and, at one point, it gets laughable. Watch for a character to be using MSN Search in 2050... Please... Contrary to Minority Report, the cars of the future are not Japanese, there good ole' Cadillacs - I knew the US car industry would come back on top! ;-) Finally, I may buy the soundtrack... The background music is very effective.<br/><br/>In summary - an excellent popcorn movie, by a director who delivers the goods."
"captain-84","8","1","3","24 July 2005"," Good summer flick... lots of commercials.
","The only reason I wouldn't give it higher than an 8 is because the product placement is delivered ad nauseum. Of course I expect a little here and there in a flick but this had way too many blatant commercials!!! That said, overall a good movie worth seeing on the big screen. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are quite believable in their roles. Scarlett is one of the most beautiful women on the screen today. Ewan is a likable ""real"" guy. The action scenes are full of fun and don't have too much of that shaky feel that makes you want to loose your cookies after 10 seconds and can barely tell what's going on. The supporting cast also do a fantastic job. Steve Buscemi is great and adds some comedy relief weather he means to or not. It's worth the big screen just ignore the commercials."
"knoxvillian","7","1","3","22 July 2005"," Islands on the screen, that is what we are.
","The Island is a big budget summer blockbuster. Directed by Michael ""Blow Stuff Up"" Bay, the film performs well as exactly what it ought to be, a flashy action-filled popcorn flick. What the film does wrong is extend beyond that.<br/><br/>With a story loosely based on the venerable but poorly produced ""The Clonus Horror"" (check Mystery Science Theater 3000 if you're interested), The Island has an exceedingly interesting concept. We are presented with the life of Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), a man living as a highly-monitored automaton in a facility chock full of similar automatons. We see the routine, the conformity, and the high orchestration that surrounds Six Echo and his peers in their controlled environment, a facility that is completely isolated from the outside world which has been contaminated by an unnamed illness. Every day (or week?), various inhabitants of this facility become winners of a lottery which carries as its prize a chance to be transported for life to The Island (applause), the last pathogen-free area left on earth, a true paradise. Following a mind-numbing routine, occasionally hobnobbing with his good friend Jordan Two Delta (the irrepressibly cute Scarlett Johannsen) while waiting for his chance to be transported to The Island (applause) should be enough to keep Six Echo happy, but from the beginning of the film on we see that he is not content and, in fact, is somewhat wary of his idyllic surroundings. Of course, his wariness is proved correct when he sneaks into a part of the facility he is not allowed to go to and sees horrors that he is not supposed to see, and so he must make a daring escape with Jordan Two Delta, who, coincidentally, has just won the lottery and is packing to leave for The Island (applause). They escape and eventually learn the horrifying truth: they are simply clones purchased by people in the real world as a form of insurance and a way to cheat death.<br/><br/>From this point on, this Michael Bay film becomes, well, a Michael Bay film. What was about to blossom into a fine, thoughtful sci-fi thriller instead explodes (quite literally) into a bloated action feature. Plot points are introduced when they are necessary to predicate another high-octane chase scene or tense shootout. So much of the potential built up by the film in its first part is squandered away in the second. Unfortunately, Michael Bay was given more movie than he knew what to do with, and so the relevance and poignancy that the film might once have been able to capture is suffocated by a string of bullets, explosions, and destroyed cars. This is indeed a great shame given the real chemistry and ability of McGregor and Johannsen. The films greatest strength is easily its stars, who pull off the interesting role of naive ""strangers in a strange land"" with aplomb. If nothing else, you are continually rooting for the beleaguered duo, and this makes the movie more than worth watching through its noisy phase.<br/><br/>The film is one that I would recommend despite its faults. It is one that is interesting (at least to a point), it contains some good suspense, good acting, and, yes, lots of glittering scenes of everything getting blow'd up. However, if you see the film, I do hope that you, like I, mourn the fact that it really could have been something more."

","So you want to go to a Sci Fi movie? These days, who knows what sci fi is? You want Logans Run? OK, you got it! You want Battlefield Earth? OK, you got it! There's no aliens, just a lot of people with personal interests. You're going to get a lot more than Sci Fi from this movie, though. Add some good IL' scenes with violence and a few chuckles. Yes, you get some Sci Fi, but really, you get more of the other stuff. <br/><br/>If you are expecting thought provoking Sci Fi, forget it. But I think most Sci Fi fans can accept the rest of the movie's action and humor. At first I was cursing the change from Sci Fi to action but later I found myself enjoying the movie.

","I managed to see this tonight at a sneak preview. I had seen a trailer or two for it, and figured it would be a decent popcorn movie. After all, the cast looked wonderful, so it couldn't be bad, right?<br/><br/>Wow.<br/><br/>Completely NOT what I was expecting. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't... that. Which made it all that much better.<br/><br/>The movie has a decent plot, not too complicated, but thought provoking enough that it gives you something to think about afterwards. Sure, it's not that original, but now-a-days, what is? And it never stops. We were there for 2 hours, but it felt like 3. But not in an ""OMG, is this ever going to end"" way, but in a ""OMG, they managed to pack so much in there"" way. The movie never stops, and by the time you're out of there, it really does feel a lot longer than it was. But I would have happily seen more.<br/><br/>They do a good job with the ending though. It was a little clichéd, but not surprisingly so. I wish they had followed up with the impact after the climax... but that could be a movie into itself.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're looking for a good summer blockbuster, this is definitely one of them. It's not quite as good as Batman Begins, but then again, I'm not sure anything this summer will be. However, this definitely makes a case for second place."

","This is a film I saw at a sneak preview a week before it came out it wasn't a movie I expected to be good but Ewan McGregger is a good actor and I thought it might be good.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty complex but I'll do my best to explain it. Two clones of ""real"" people escape there institute after they figure out that they are clones meant to be harvested if something should happin to there host. They are told that they've won some kind of lottery and are being sent to an island that is the paradise on earth because the rest of earth has been ""contaminated"" and had died and that they are the survivors. After they are told they won they are killed and harvested.

"savagesteve13","1","2","10","3 July 2013"," Many problems with this film!
","At first the movie starts out with an intriguing premise, cloned humans who are promised an eventual trip to ""The Island"" a paradise. The first 30 minutes are very interesting as you get to know the main characters and you are given hints of something not being right. Then all of a sudden you see Sean Bean...uh oh. Yet another ""Sean Bean dies in a film"" movie. The movie quickly falls off the tracks and degrades into a quasi-Logan's Run style plot, punctuated with an orgy of car chases, murders, more chases and a blatant ripoff of Return of the Jedi with a hovercycle chase. Despite being plain old human clones the two main characters seem virtually invincible considering what happens to them. A character development is totally wasted in the form of Djimon, the actor who plays the director's main henchman and hired killer who originally was an African tribal refugee. The movie doesn't spend any time on his character and it just felt strange at the end they would put him in there as a main plot hook.<br/><br/>Really all you need to know is ""Logan's Run"". Its plot is lifted straight from that movie with a small addition of an evil (of course) corporation funded by rich selfish people (of course).<br/><br/>Oh did I say its LONG....very long, 2 hours and 30 minutes long. The movie would have been acceptable if they had cut 45 minutes of unnecessary car chases out and put in some real intrigue."
"zetes","9","2","10","8 August 2005"," Wow! It turns out Michael Bay can actually make a good movie. Even a great one!
","Maybe I was just feeling easy, but Bay's The Island strikes me as the most satisfying film I've seen all summer  very possibly the best film I've seen so far from 2005. Is it brilliant? Perhaps not, but it's a gripping sci-fi thriller that works on almost all levels. As sci-fi, it reminds me of stuff from the 70s like Logan's Run. I'm a big fan of Utopian/Dystopian sci-fi, and it pleased me enormously on that level. As an action film, it has a lot of stunning set pieces and chases. The action sequences are a lot clearer than is usual for Bay. Unlike two other actioners I've recently seen, Mr. & Mrs. Smith and The Devil's Rejects, I was never at all confused at what was happening. There aren't too many action bits that made me think, ""Yeah right,"" and at least one of those over-the-top moments had a punchline that was so funny that it was very well worth it (it was probably the only one liner from an action movie that ever made me laugh out loud). The actors are all just models here (Scarlet Johanssen is some very good eye candy), but I did like a few of the supporting character actors, notably Ethan Phillips, Brian Stepanek, and the always reliable Steve Buscemi. Michael Clark Duncan is also good, though his part is too small. Sure, the film's political agenda skews to the right, but the story follows a common science fiction motif which questions a scientific moral issue to a ridiculous extreme. Frankenstein is pretty conservative, as well. I think that the politics in The Island are historically interesting, but not something that could effect anyone's opinion. The production design is outstanding, as are the cinematography and score. I couldn't have believed that Michael Bay could actually produce something not only watchable, but damn good. I think if it hadn't been him who directed it, the movie would be getting a lot more praise."
"kdenotte","9","2","10","15 July 2005"," Hands Down the Summer's Best Film
","Michael Bay hit the nail on the head with this amazing, futuristic action film. The movie gallops through its two-hour running time, and leaves you wanting more (but in a good way). Alex Kurtzman's screenplay is well-written and fully illuminates Caspian Tredwell-Owen's story. That said, this movie is set 14 years in the future and thus asks you to make allowances for some of the more creative sections of the action scenes (SPOILER: during the chase on the LA Freeway there are not only cars, helicopters, and armored trucks chasing Ewan and Scarlett, but also the equivalent of flying jet-skies). Ewan slips into the character of Lincoln Six Echo with ease and makes his natural curiosity endearing and meaningful in a world of compliance and calm. Scarlett Johansson's Jordan Two Delta runs the gamut from childlike to wise to hardened. Their friendship inside the evil Merrick Institute is closely monitored by Sean Bean's Merrick. Bean's performance is truly inspired not only because Merrick is truly the most despicable of the ""bad-guys"" in Bean's considerable portfolio, but also because he is able to capture two sides of a man who believes he is God. SPOILER: One of the most chilling scenes in the film is an exchange between Albert Laurent, played brilliantly by Djimon Hounsou, and Merrick in which Merrick asks Laurent who in the world (other then himself) can say that in two years they will have a cure for children's leukemia? Speaking of Djimon Hounsou, what a phenomenal actor! He got to play one of those rare characters that changed sides in the end of the film, and it was brilliant, not just a plot device.<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this movie however is not just the beautiful camera work and the tight story moved by great actors, it was the discussion that happened after the credits rolled. This movie has been compared to The Matrix because of the alternate reality portions, but I think that it is more comparable to Gattaca because the story deals with survival and the need to rise above what others perceive you to be (SPOILER: the scene where Steve Buscemi tells Jordan and Lincoln that they are not human, or at least not human like him). This movie is hands down the summer's best film because it challenges you to think about the realities of life and death and materialism and ask yourself the big question, would you if you could? The basic principle of the film is this line (repeated over and over again) ""humans will do anything to survive"", this movie not only survives, it flourishes."
"chrohr","5","3","21","9 July 2005"," Better than other Bay films
","I just saw a sneak preview of this and I must say that I was a little surprised by this movie. First the strengths: The concept of the cloning and the harvested people is pretty fascinating and is rather thought provoking especially in times when debate over stem cell research rages. How far is too far in medical research? And when does the desire to help people turn into unethical pride and other immoral whims? In this way the movie struck me as very good. The special effects are also great, the action scenes are intense, and the acting is actually pretty solid in general.<br/><br/>The weaknesses do drag the movie down and left me with a sense of emptiness as I walked out of the theater. They include too much action, not enough character development, and bad direction of acting. For example, Scarlett Johansson, as good an actress as she is, gives it her best shot, but sometimes her acting seems forced. This is not because of lack of talent, because she has plenty of it, but rather due to deficiencies in directing and writing. I would of loved to see more depth to McGregor's and Johansson's characters. Furthermore, there is so much action that it takes away from developing characters and more interesting plot details. The cinematography during the action scenes is very shaky and therefore takes away from the consistency of the scenes a bit.<br/><br/>Overall I recommend it if you want entertaining food for thought that poses ethical questions about oppression, science, and hierarchy."

","What's starts out as the makings of a great dystopian sci-fi, eventually degenerates into a cheesy action movie. Shame, as the movie has a brilliant premise, and starts out very strong. All the ideas and potential are there, but rather than focus on what could have been a great story, throws everything away in the second hour in action sequences, which are impressive, often ridiculous, and eventually tiring. The big budget shows too in the incredible visuals and early sets, but sadly the storytelling plays second fiddle. Strong actors and parts are wasted, and the female lead, with little material to work with, is a cardboard cutout. It condescends the IQ of the viewer by telling not showing. The potential for a great story was there, but the telling - in the second part - was terrible. Shame."

Go and watch this movie if you like interesting plots and sci fi movies. Reminds me a lot of ""repo men"" and ""fifth element"". I have no clue why some people gave this a negative review... they must be brain dead cause mark my words this will be apart of the classic great movies in about 20 years time."
"maxcobain","4","1","4","5 July 2013"," An interesting concept dragged down by self-indulgent, ridiculous scenes from Michael Bay
","From the first 20 minutes of 'The Island', I was intrigued, the building uneasiness and suspicion created was interesting, but as the film went on, I became less and less impressed. The child-like gimmick, of them both having no knowledge of he outside world, that both Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johannson indulge, quickly grows old. The overdrawn chase/fight/ridiculous building collapse scenes become almost a parody of Michael Bay's directorial work, endless explosions and gunfire. The impossibility of these scenes detract from the clever concept of celebrity clones the film revolves around. While Ewan Mcgregor's second appearance in the film, and dialogue with himself was amusing at points, and added to evidence throughout the film that it had the potential to be brilliant, but that it fell short with Michael Bay at the helm."

","I'll keep this brief: firstly, this is enjoyable nonsense - good enough to buy on DVD, far, FAR superior to the God-awful Mr and Mrs Smith which promised to be enjoyable nonsense too, but turned out to be utter tripe.<br/><br/>One good line in this film is in response to Lincoln asking Mac who God is: ""You know when you close your eyes and wish for something really, really hard? God's the guy that ignores you."" Unfortunately there are moments of misogyny in this film which really bug me: Mac's 'joke' about never lending a woman your credit card is so lame he may as well have thrown in a mother-in-law gag while he was at it, and his pretty girlfriend is portrayed as a dum, yapping nuisance who was only there to keep PVC uniform's stashed in her closet and ferry the beer in. In other words she was an interfering nag. Why a lady as pretty as this would shack up with such a useless slimeball is beyond me, but it seems to happen a lot in these kind of 'boys own' American movies.<br/><br/>While talking to Lincoln and Jordon he describes 'some hag trophy wife....' which is rich coming from an ugly nerd like him.<br/><br/>It's been a long time since I've seen a film which so clearly has been written by men aiming for the spotty teenage boy market, and unfortunately their attitude towards women and the juvenile way they are portrayed gets on my nerves.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's a pretty good Saturday night popcorn flick.

"The_Void","7","1","4","14 August 2005"," Flawed, but nice Sci-Fi thriller
","Michael Bay is well known for his in your face action thrillers, and so it came as something of a surprise to see him direct something like this. The Island is a Sci-Fi thriller that takes influence from the likes of THX-1138 and works more on it's ideas and themes than Bay's trademark action sequences. The film starts off in a Utopian facility where we meet Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGreggor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), along with a load of other people dressed in white. The people of this facility have been told that a contagious virus has wiped out the population of Earth and they are the only remaining people. The only thing that keeps them going is the promise that 'lottery' winners get to go to a serene paradise known as 'the island'. Lincoln Six Echo smells a rat, however, and after finding out that the facility is really a place where clones of rich people are kept for spare parts, he takes Jordan Two Delta and escapes into the wider world (of many advertisements...) to look for the man he's a clone of, and hope to stay alive.<br/><br/>Once we leave the Utopian facility, the film pretty much follows a standard chase formula, and this is obviously where Michael Bay is much more at home. Cars get smashed and people are dropped from the top of skyscrapers, and it's only then that you know you're in a Michael Bay movie. Usually Bay's daft action gets annoying quickly, but it's OK here because at least it has something behind it. While the action sequences are pretty hollow in terms of emotion; it adds a further level of enjoyment to a movie that has already tested your brain by that point. The cast is really good, with the two leads doing their jobs well and being supported excellently. Steve Buscemi is an actor that needs to be seen more, and his performance is nice; albeit too small. The real standout among the support cast is Djimon Hounsou. He has an incredible style, and it's obvious that Michael Bay thinks so too with all the close up's we're treated to. The Island isn't without it's problems  the music is out of place most of the time, there's an extremely out of place sex scene and the film goes on a bit towards the end, as it could do with being about twenty minutes shorter; but on the whole, this is an enjoyable flick that will entertain and get you thinking. For once, Michael Bay has made something worth seeing."

This sci-fi, action masterpiece is about a mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) who chases two human clones (Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson) who escaped from an underground facility after finding out their true fate.<br/><br/>Well everyone, Michael Bay has done it again. He has brought you Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, and now The Island-another intense action 'blow-stuff-up' movie with a little sci-fi to it. Bay has made his name by making loud, elaborate, and often silly action flicks. Yes, people, action movies containing explosions, chase scenes, & gun shootings are what he's good at.<br/><br/>The actors did an outstanding job with their roles. Known for his charming good looks and his very outstanding talent, Ewan McGregor (Star Wars I, II,& III, Moulin Rouge) did an outstanding job portraying his role in this film and I am quite impressed. McGregor plays a resident of an underground facility, named Lincoln Six-Echo, who questions this underground environment and hopes to be chosen to go to this paradise island. But Lincoln learns the hard way that this is all a bunch of nonsense and escapes for his life along with fellow resident, Jordan Two-Delta, played by Scarlett Johansson (Lost In Translation, Match Point). So that's when the fun action begins and the chase is on. Although Johansson's character is different than the ones from her previous films, she plays alongside McGregor pretty well. She looks mighty hot in this movie. Scarlett, you just got yourself a new fan.<br/><br/>The film has outstanding supporting actors: Djimon Hounsou(Constantine, Gladiator), who plays a bounty hunter, Albert Laurent, who is sent to go after the two clones, Sean Bean (The Lord of the Rings, National Treasure), who is typecast as a bad guy and in fact, portrays one in the movie, Steve Buscemi (Armageddon, Con Air), known for his sense of humor and Michael Clarke Duncan (Green Mile, Armageddon). They all did a great job with their roles as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the whole movie a lot-all the action, the explosions, the shooting and the killing, the chase scenes, the humor, and the actors as well. If you're not into sci-fi and action flicks, this film is not for you. But if you like these kinds of movies, watch and enjoy! Otherwise, this film is only for audiences of people ages 16 and up. In some opinions, taking a science fiction story and turning it into an action thriller may not be the best thing to do, but I like that idea. Gee, I guess Michael Bay just can't help himself. Action flicks are his specialty as a director. So, here's what I have to say overall-""Dude, I found a flying bug."" (That's said, I just found an ALL TIME favorite movie now.)"
"HattoriHanzo_TheThird","10","1","4","2 August 2005"," A great Action flick, displaying a convincing plot, and Depth
","This is one of the best movies I have seen! It was really well made, the acting was excellent, the plot was convincing and realistic, and there were some very memorable action scenes contained within too. <br/><br/>First of all, you start out seeing the daily lives of the supposed survivors of a virus of some sort that wiped out man kind. The survivors are all living in this facility, and cannot go outside for fear of contamination. There is a daily lottery, and the winners get to go to ""The Island,"" which is supposed to be a really nice place. Ewan McGregor, one day, finds a moth flying around in the mechanical part of the building, where he was visiting his friend that lives there, and then eventually discovers that there is no ""contamination"" outside, and that the people that win the lottery to go to the Island are really just being killed. <br/><br/>He and Scarlette Johansson escape from the facility (after some pretty intense scenes, and close calls to dying), and find out that they are just clones that act as extensions to their ""owner's"" lives. Rich people that are sick spend a lot of money to have these clones made, and when they need them, the clones can give them blood or organs, or whatever they need. <br/><br/>It was a really neat movie, to see how it all unravels. Scarlette and Ewan are a great duo, and the special effects in this movie are amazing!<br/><br/>A great all around movie!"
"hairbykaren","10","1","4","1 August 2005"," outstanding movie
","This was a great movie that kept you on the edge of your seat. The whole movie was action packed. There was some unrealistic things but what sci-fi movie isn't. I don't think this movie is getting enough recognition..the movie flowed from beginning to the end. I cant wait to see it again. How the story was revealed to the audience was great. Gradually, the truth comes to light. The story was somehow a blend between the movie, The Truman Show (starred by Jim Carrey) and The Matrix. Well, you should see for yourself.<br/><br/>A big thanks to Director Michael Bay for how he wants the show to be drawn and filmed. It was a fantastic job. The visuals were incredible as there were many explosions, as well as the way future was depicted was shown in the movie.<br/><br/>An action film which makes you ponder whether who should be killed. It not just about killing between the good and bad, but between the usefulness/value of the person. The film touches a lot on morality issues and the ethical issues revolving the whole new world of bioengineering.<br/><br/>The film was thrilling and made me ponder over the social, moral and ethical issues that are currently present in our society. That's good, because that was something wasn't sure about in the past."
"l_trotea","10","1","4","31 July 2005"," Best movie
","This movie could be the best movie I've seen. I've seen heaps of movies and this one out does all of them. I know this sounds like someone paid me to say this but really its the truth. It's a definite GUY film as I went to see it with my sister and she didn't like it.<br/><br/>For me, it has everything that I love; great chase scenes, futuristic sci-fi, very rich and modern sets, most of all, the chick is HOT!. She done it for me, ha ha! But seriously, the movie had a great storyline and right when you think it's finished, the characters come back to finish it off, which was great because it would have spoiled the ending.<br/><br/>So all in all, the movie deserves a definite 10/10 from me! If you haven't seen it, it's a MUST!"
"Quayee","10","1","4","31 July 2005"," Really good
","This film has been given a lot of harsh feedback by many people. Which is really a shame. ""The Island"" was very good. It had a great cast, good storyline and plenty of action which kept me entertained throughout. The film is lengthy but surprisingly I didn't look at my watch once (which i usually do for movies that are quite lengthy).<br/><br/>The thing I really enjoyed about ""The Island"" was the idea behind it. The story was really interesting. I quite often found myself sitting (in the cinema, next to whitey), putting myself in people's shoes. The clones for example, I looked at the story from their p.o.v, and did the same with the other people.<br/><br/>Being quite far-fetched and futuristic I was surprised at just how believable the film was. Though it was set in the future, I didn't feel that I was watching someone's 'dream' of how they want the future to be like. I felt that most things shown will probably happen in the future.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was great. Even if your not sure, due to all of the bad reviews, give it a go and see what you think, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"DR-9","9","1","4","25 July 2005"," Action, Acting and Food for Thought
","Is it the writing? The acting? The message? Whatever the reason, I found myself caring right away for the two leads in this involving tale. We first meet Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson as docile members of an idyllic futuristic society. Once the stage is set, the pace picks up as the true nature of their world is revealed, and they take steps to save their own lives and bring justice to their community. White-knuckle chases on every imaginable type of vehicle are anchored by the pair's convincingly rendered transformation to emotional maturity.<br/><br/>A sweet love story, a thrilling action picture -- what more could you ask for? Actual thought! In a world facing ethical decisions involving human embryo research, the film's message that, however created, human beings are human beings, is powerfully communicated.<br/><br/>Parental warning: This film contains extremely violent scenes, almost all necessary for the communication of the message of the movie, but disturbing - even, in the case of a young mother and of Michael Clarke Duncan's character, heartbreaking. This film is NOT for children."
"mseidell","9","1","4","24 July 2005"," Michael Bay Gets Good
","If you liked The Rock, both iterations of Bad Boys, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, you will come for the action, and by God, there's a truckload. If you hated these movies because of their outrageous plot-and-character badness, don't carry a grudge for Michael Bay. He takes an interesting story line (albeit rather full of holes) and shows us the sci-fi/action money. Where actors could have phoned the roles in, everyone has a bit of depth. Not much, but enough to go far beyond a blast-em-up actioner. The action sequences are the centerpiece of the movie (duh), one crackling, gob-smacking destruction of property after the next. MacGregor, Johanssen, Buscemi, and for his short time, Duncan, shine brightly (well...I was a bit too hypnotized by Johanssen's lips to be considered a fair judge of her). And I was pleased to see Shawnee Smith, if only for a few ticks - somebody please hire her for a good role - don't hold 'The Blob' against her, Hollywood, it's been seventeen years already."
"FilmGirl222","9","1","4","23 July 2005"," I loved it :-). Ewan is unbelievable cute.
","I loved this movie. It was so original and so clever. Everything fit together nicely. I didn't think it was going to be this good. I went in the first place mainly just to see Ewan McGregor, who is my absolute favorite actor. Anyway, i thought it would be your typical Michael Bay movie that doesn't have much of a story and is non stop hard core action. Since those are not my kind of movies I wasn't sprinting to go get tickets, but when i heard what it was about and that Ewan McGregor was in it I had to see it. Let me tell you something it was so unbelievable I can't even explain it. The look of it was just amazing. The cinematography, the sets, everything was just wonderful to look at. Every person hired to act in that movie did a very good job to. I thought both Ewan and Scarlett did a wonderful job. The relationship they had together was just wonderful to watch. Going into the film I didn't think that the two of them would have chemistry, but actually I thought they had wonderful chemistry. I would say it's Ewan's second best on screen chemistry after he and Nicole Kidman. It was so wonderful to watch Ewan's and Scarlett's friendship turn to absolute love. The story itself was just amazing. There are moments that just make you smile and then their are some that just break your heart. I do have to warn people that at the beginning it is a little gruesome, but after Ewan and Scarlett escape everything is fine. I don't think that everyone will like this movie only because of the subject matter. As for me I absolutely loved it. It's the kind of movie you either love or hate, from what i'm seeing from reviews of it. I do think that this is Michael Bay's best movie that he has made, and i think that everyone should give it a chance and go to see it."
"StubbleInTheField","9","1","4","23 July 2005"," Minor Criticism
","The movie over all was excellent, but it's downfall was the minor details that made some scenes unbelievable. One scene in particular, a scene quite similar to the highway scene in Bad Boys II, was when Lincoln 6 Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan 2 Delta (Scarlett Johansson) were on the back of a semi truck pushing off metal dumbbell looking objects that must have weighed 2 tons each while the driver of the truck remained completely oblivious. Unless the cabin of the semi truck is soundproof and had no rear view mirrors I would understand why the driver wouldn't even stop to consider the significant damage brought onto the highway and it's many victims caught in the middle, but nowhere in the film does it even mention or give us the slightest innuendo that it just might be soundproof. In fact, the whole idea of the movie is completely unbelievable. Would it really be possible for a clone who was ""born"" and raised as a clone and knew of nothing else except for what has been taught to question his existence and eventually find out what he is and then liberate an entire clone colony to discovering the truth? I mean seriously, 14 years from now with all this new sweet technology we still haven't managed to put security cameras or at least a guard in front of the most vital parts of a clone colony, considering the idea that we have a clone colony (i.e. the hologram room that contained the machinery that blocked out what the true outside looked like with beautiful images of butterflies and flowers and oceans, etc.) And above all, how do clones know how to mate when they were never introduced to the whole mating process? Other than that it was the most kick a** movie I've seen this summer."
"the_Poppuns","5","1","4","23 July 2005"," Did someone say Sanctuary?
","I knew going in that this movie wasn't going to be original. I have read here and elsewhere about the plot similarities to a movie I haven't seen, but there are a lot of similarities to Logan's Run, a movie that I like very much and I just couldn't get over it. Because there was nothing to help me get over it. Even if you haven't seen those movies there is a 'been there, done that' feeling to this, especially for a SciFi fan like myself. And the rest of it is a lot of exploding car chases, which always makes my mind wander, and a scene we've seen too many times in movies involving clones/identical twins. It goes something like this ""I'm him""; ""No I'm him."".<br/><br/>Now I love the cast, especially Sean Bean. And he'g got a line at the end of this movie that I couldn't believe. I just sat there shaking my head thinking 'no he's not going to say that, no'. Well he did. It's a well known joke by a very popular American comedian and I don't know if it was supposed to be a nod to said comedian, which would be absolutely silly at that point in the film, or if they were just stealing it and trying to turn it into an ""Hasta La Vista, Baby!"" type quote. And having to watch him fight Ewan McGregor bothered me because I like both of them and I'm thinking 'Don't hit his face!', then 'NO, don't hit HIS face!!!"" :o) <br/><br/>If you like the actors in it, they all look really nice. And I can't say I was disappointed because I wasn't expecting much. I don't have a problem with Michael Bay either. I like the look of his films and this is no different. We've just seen better, a lot better, from everyone involved."
"whatsherface1015","8","1","4","22 July 2005"," A fun ride, if a little troubling (very slight spoiler)
","I just saw this movie last night at a sneak preview in my town, and I was quite surprised and pleased at how much fun it was. I was excited to see it because I love Sean Bean, but I was expecting it to be another lame science fiction disaster. Instead, I found it clever, thoughtful, well-written/produced/acted/etc., and socially relevant. Unfortunately, this social relevance pertains to its very obvious anti-stem cell research agenda. When I told the guy from the studio who was asking for our opinions after the movie that I liked the film but disapproved of the message, he didn't look at all surprised by my reaction. Luckily, I can reconcile my overall approval of ""The Island"" with its uncomfortable message because I don't believe that using human clones for spare parts when the original body gets damaged is the same as using stem cells to try to cure cancer, as stem cells are not and never will be people.<br/><br/>But back to the movie, it had interesting references to earlier science fiction ""futuristic society"" works such as ""The Giver"" by Lois Lowry, and even a German radio play called ""Der Fisch"" (the Fish) in which a man living in a futuristic world supposedly devoid of all natural resources and atmosphere claims to have seen a creature that has been extinct for hundreds of years: a fish. Another viewer claimed that the movie reminded him of ""Brave New World,"" but references to this novel are very slight, as the controlled society of Huxley's vision is hierarchical and based on pleasure and satisfaction. This can hardly be said of ""The Island.""<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the movie and was very glad that I saw it, and I hope that other viewers who recognize the blatant metaphor of the plot take it with a grain of salt and don't start to equate Scarlett Johansson with stem cells in their minds."
"sunimoto","8","3","23","11 July 2005"," Great Hollywood fun
","This is a great Hollywood pure-entertainment movie. It does raise some questions on the issue of human cloning, but overall it's just great high-quality entertainment. Special effects are amazing. Chase scenes are astonishing. Lots of stuff is blowing up. Comic-relief actors. Beautiful girl as one of the main characters. This is a movie made by formula to appeal to the masses and this is in no way a bad thing. I liked this movie a lot. Actors played very well. Representation of near-future is realistic. Definitely a must-see.<br/><br/>What really bothered me, though, is abundance of in-your-face product placement. They really went over the top with it...At times it was unpleasant to watch because of this. I give this movie 8 stars b/c of how product placement was done; otherwise it would be 10.<br/><br/>I wonder why they had so much advertisement there...They didn't secure big-enough budget, was it just a greed, some studio agreements?"
"happyface7412","7","3","24","10 July 2005"," Michael Bay redeemed!!! Great action movie
","I saw the sneak preview of The Island in San Francisco earlier tonight, and let me say what a ride it was. I normally do not like Michael Bay films, The Rock is an exception, so going into the movie I was not expecting much. But The Island simply blew me away from its intense chase scenes to its unexpected comedic moments. I will go through the good and the bad of the movie. <br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Brilliant film-making. I did not think I would be saying this about a Bay movie but I really liked his style in this movie and not only with the action scenes.<br/><br/>Compelling plot. I liked the story even though it takes a lot from Logan's Run and other movies about the future or cloning. I believe it did well to take elements from other movies and bring them into something new.<br/><br/>Music. The score by Steve Jablonsky was fantastic, need I say more?<br/><br/>Likable actors. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson were good but not great in The Island but what they did have going for them was that they were very dynamic when on the screen together. <br/><br/>The action. Of course.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>Not very thought provoking. I believe that The Island could have had a little less action and a little more thinking and questioning a la Blade Runner. As it was it stuck mostly to its action roots instead of exploring a little deeper.<br/><br/>Enough running already! For the first hour or so, it seems that all the protagonists do is run. It starts to get a bit tedious but not so much that it ruins the picture.<br/><br/>Product placement. Puma, MSN, Apple, Xbox, Aquafina, Cadillac, Nokia, and many more, there was enough product placement to fill a house. I guess they had to fund the movie somehow. <br/><br/>Conclusion: All in all, Ifound The Island to be a very entertaining movie, well worth my money.It overcomes its few shortcomings nicely and becomes what a summer blockbuster should be, great fun."
"kemmason","8","2","14","13 July 2005"," quite entertaining, if still Hollywood
","I hit a sneak preview of this movie, and was pleasantly surprised to find that this movie, while being a typical Hollywood movie in many respects (predictable, unrealistic in many respects), I found it very entertaining, and thought they knew they were being unrealistic in parts, and sort of made fun of themselves, which made it OK. The general story was pretty cool as well, and reasonably well done. Definitely worth a see. I'm a big science fiction fan, and while the science was far from perfect, they weren't pretending to try to make a super realistic (read hard-science fiction) movie, so it worked out alright. I'm pretty picky when it comes to science fiction (I walked out of AI, e.g. -- the first 3 minutes of the movie promised a movie that the rest didn't even attempt to deliver)."
"UNOhwen","Null","1","5","28 September 2015"," Anyone who likes any Michael Bay trash, should have their brain examined.
","In this Clonus Horror DIRECT rip-off (which the makers of said film took these fools to court, and WON), it's another brainless Michael Bay-fest, meaning lots of noise, and VERY little intelligence.<br/><br/>Here's something to ponder; even though cloning a live human'so illegal (in this dystopian flick), Sean Bean - the nefarious head of the 'farm' which the clones are made - hires an 'expert' from 'Blackwater' (hmmm... I think we've heard THAT name before), and tell him 'if the secret - that clones are not veggie-patties, but, walking, talking Scarlett Johannsen, and Ewan McGregor, it would cause massive criminal charges, etc.'<br/><br/>So - what does does this 'security genius' do?<br/><br/>It Michael Bay,, so, this means MASSIVE carnage, KILKING of cops, and innocent bystanders, RAMMING police cars - all in central LA, in the middle of the day.<br/><br/>You think anyone might notice, eh?<br/><br/>After all, LA 'news' is notorious for interrupting anything to air live coverage of ANY car chase....<br/><br/>In film, there is 'good' crap, and here's rotten crap, this is beyond awful.<br/><br/>This is the type of garbage people who never went to, or finished grade school (forget high school!) think is good (I saw the moron who actually gave this 9 stars. He is definitely some gas jockey, or worse - no offence to gas pumpers). <br/><br/>Why did I say this - intentionally - a 2nd time?<br/><br/>Because, sometimes I just like to torture myself.<br/><br/>Seriously, there's NOTHING redeeming about it, and as for Mr. Bay; as the saying goes 'only the good die young,' and this agent of Satan will be here - unfortunately - too long."

","This was a Good Movie. Of course I missed it when it came out in the theaters, but a quick poll of co-workers suggests that a lot of people simply did this as well. Here's hoping its' DVD release generates some significant revenue for the filmmakers.<br/><br/>I won't give a synopsis here -- that's been done many other places, but let's just say that this movie is both engaging and tense; it will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>This is not meant to be a serious commentary on the dangers of cloning, but rather a nice piece of fiction which happens to revolve around the subject. Such movies are generally more watchable anyway because instead of trying to drive its' points into your head with a hammer (e.g. ""Gattaca""), ""The Island"" lets you enjoy a good action thriller without coming away feeling like you've been to church.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for an entertaining and engaging thrill ride. If you're looking for a serious depiction on the effects of genetic replication with serious and sensitive social commentary, look elsewhere -- in fact, stop watching movies altogether and read a damn book. It's called the ""entertainment"" industry for a good reason."

"Decrypt3","9","1","5","9 August 2005"," Don't believe the trailer
","I've heard a lot of people saying they're going to pass on seeing ""The Island"" because they saw the trailer and thought it looked stupid. Believe me, the trailer is stupid but the movie is not. This is a movie that is both thought-provoking and filled with intense action throughout.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty near top-notch. Sean Bean is, of course, a master of being quietly evil. Ewan McGregor can't quite pull off an American accent, but he can convincingly sound like an American trying to imitate a Scottish accent, which I thought was good. In both of his roles, he's excellent. On one side, the naive but courageous child-in-an-adult-body, on the other side, the millionaire playboy. Scarlett Johansson didn't have to deal with the same kind of duality, but she also pulls off the naive-but-courageous thing well.<br/><br/>The action scenes in this film were jaw-dropping. The car chase through whatever big city they end up in (I forget where it was supposed to be) was one of the most amazing I've ever seen, in which an exceptional amount of stuff got smashed up in a very spectacular way (think lots of very heavy pieces of metal colliding with speeding cars). I guarantee the action scenes here will have your heart racing.<br/><br/>I only have a couple of complaints - they're really only nitpicks that probably won't matter to other people. The first is the constant, relentless product placement. You'll notice that every car in the movie, with exceptions I can count on one hand, is a Chrysler 300, mostly with modified grilles. The MSN Search thing also bothered me. The other thing is the use of fat black people for comic relief. It happens twice. I admit the time with the construction worker was quite funny, but still.<br/><br/>The plot, while not original, involves an old ethical debate that is explored in an interesting yet somewhat biased way. It'll set you thinking, if nothing else. It even makes the ending scene, which would otherwise be painfully corny, moving, or I might even say powerful.<br/><br/>Don't believe the trailer for ""The Island"". If you want to see a great action movie that isn't totally mindless, go see ""The Island""."
"sarenam-1","9","1","5","9 August 2005"," Saw it, Loved it...
","I saw 2 movies this weekend. The Island and Fantastic Four. The Island was by far the better movie. It starts out a little slow, but then is a wild ride! It had much more story than I expected. Ewan McGregor was fantastic. Scarlett was cast as the leading lady, but was really there to support Ewan's character. I will see it again, probably will buy it on DVD. Go see it! It was fun to watch and a spooky glimpse into the future. How far do we want science to go? How far will science be allowed to go? The villain was a little weak, but not so much so that it detracted from the film. There are many ""Ouch, that's going to leave a mark!"" scenes. It is definitely worth seeing on the big screen!"
"sammyxp","9","1","5","1 August 2005"," Well Done!
","I haven't seen a movie of this genre done this well in a long time. The action is intense without bordering ludicrous and the story is interesting enough, with a few twists and turns to keep your attention. As a bonus, it's even kind of thought-provoking - inspiring a few discussions about cloning and it's possible repercussions. If you're a car nut - you'll love the V12 - powered 2009 Cadillac and the jet bikes. There are more than a few excellent chase scenes. In general, I'm a big fan of post-apocalyptic story lines, but The Island seems to bring it one step closer to home by incorporating a controversial topic that resonated in today's news. If you're a fan of any kind of science fiction, you might as well go on and watch this movie."

Not only was the writing great, the acting was seemingly flawless and the editing was amazing. <br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson made some difficult lines believable that transcended the usual cheese factor that is inherent with 'people being introduced into an alien society' situations.<br/><br/>Being a huge movie critic by my own right, having been disappointed an infinite number of times in the recent 5 or so years with movies where there are special effects in lieu of a quality plot.

He tells this dream to the city doctor who appears to be more than intrigued by it, in fact he has a mechanical table violently take hold of MacGregor and inject robot mini probes into the sides of his eyes.<br/><br/>MacGregor's curiosity makes him start to question everything and it is sparked more by a maintenance man (Steve Busemi) who lives outside the enclosed city. (The people are told that the outside was contaminated from a great catastrophe). This curiosity continues to increase when he finds a rather large insect. MacGregor starts to learn the real truth behind the ""lottery"" and save his lady friend (Johansen) who has won the lottery and is scheduled to go to the supposed island.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie plays out like a super high tech version of Logan's Run. The special effects are amazing especially the futuristic Los Angeles. Even though you can kind of figure what will happen, the movie is compelling mostly due to the excellent acting of the two stars."

","I thought it was a bit weird, but really enjoyed it. The crashing down sign, where they escaped without harm was a bit ridiculous. But who could complain about watching Ewan and Charlise running around in white sweat suits for 2 hours? They are both really good looking. I thought there were enough plot twists to keep me occupied, and it doesn't really explain everything in the end...I mean, what ever happened to Jordan (the real one) and the little boy that the clone Jordan talked to on the phone. I also thought they did a good job at getting some humor in there: there were plenty of Jesus and God jokes as well as the whole making fun of people who have their first kiss. Overall...I really liked it. I would go see it again."
"Danishyyk","9","1","5","22 July 2005"," Sorta semi-almost, might contain spoilers, so be warned
","Waking up earlier than I normally do on a summer day (a high school student such as myself leads a nocturnal existence), I hoped that ""The Island"" would be worth sacrificing a few hours of beauty sleep. Thankfully, it was. Director Michael Bay is notorious for directing big-budget action flicks, as obvious in ""Armageddon"". ""The Island"" is no exception. At times the film was chock-full of exciting action. The car chase sequence involving the hunt for Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta (Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson) by Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) and his minions does not rival the one of ""The Matrix""...it exceeds it. Just watching a bunch of high dollar SUVs and sedans, some not even released to the public yet, being pulverized was the highlight of the entire sequence. The story itself wasn't bad either. It was an original enough idea that doesn't remind one of another movie. Lincoln Six Echo's quest to discover the truth behind the so-called island was quite an interesting one. It was also funny at times, especially in scenes with Steve Buscemi's character McCord. The scene where Echo and Delta enter the desert bar looking for McCord for answers is quite amusing, especially when Echo is inquiring about what McCord is doing ""in the can"". The audience was about as amused as I was as evidenced by the laughter that ensued when Echo was repeating what the bartender was saying. Overall, I think this movie is worth seeing if you enjoy high-energy action sequences or even science fiction/fantasy flicks. It's not heavy on the science fiction, but it is slightly noticeable but not enough to make it a corny movie. Ewan McGregor was perfect for this role, as was Scarlett Johansson. I hate to admit it, but although McGregor was good in ""Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of The Sith"" (which is saying something considering the acting in that movie was not at all great), he was so much better in ""The Island"". I really can't compare Johansson's work to her other movies as I am not much of a fan of hers, but I am a big Ewan McGregor fan and I will definitely recommend this one to other McGregor fans."
"levit008","6","1","5","21 July 2005"," Coma meets Soylent Green
","Not an excessively original plot but lots of action. If one is willing to suspend disbelief, it becomes a reasonably diverting film. The special effects are quite good and there are enough car crashes and explosions to meet the needs of most Vin Diesel fans. The acting by Ewan McGregor was reasonably competent except when he lapsed into a Scottish accent as required by the plot. Scarlett Johansson was less inspired but was able to keep up with the action scenes with the possible exception of when she was presumably being dangled by the arm over the edge of a 70 story building. It was a challenge for the film to depict futuristic vehicles for the various chases but prototype models of various manufacturers were in evidence and consequently rather diverting. The sound track was good but was even better after I stuffed some tissues into my ears. In summary, an entertaining action-science fiction movie worth the price of admission but not a great deal more."
"myword2k3","9","1","5","20 July 2005"," Does Michael Bay survive his first stint out of the shadows of Bruckheimer?
","There are many out there who despise anything and everything even remotely associated with the name ""Michael Bay"". I definitely cannot be placed in that category. I simply love his work to the extent of liking even his sappy, cliché filled take on the Japanese attack on ""Pearl Harbor"". Admit it, it had its moments.<br/><br/>Finally stepping out of the shadows of his mentor and producer Jerry Bruckheimer Bay takes a step in the right direction by focusing more on the human elements in this sci-fi tale and less on the ""bang 'em up"" style of action film-making he has become renowned (and sometimes critisised) for.<br/><br/>""The Island"" tells the story of a cloning facility where clones are bred specifically for the purpose of providing organs for their ""buyers"" in the real world outside. This truth is carefully concealed from the clones. It is only when Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) stats having nightmares and doubts about his existence that he uncovers the secrets of the facility.<br/><br/>The name of a director or star attached to a movie can often lead to many false and high expectations from viewers. Take for example a very recent case - take a very successful director with an unchallenged box-office record in the sci-fi genre, couple that with possibly the worlds box-office draw and give them a classic sci-fi novel to film. Fans expected a big sci-fi extravaganza with the usual ""darn Yankee's saving the world"" storyline. Sadly they didn't get it. Instead the got a more character driven story with the special effects and explosions shoved into the background. End Result? Unsatisfied moviegoers.<br/><br/>This is the same problem the usual Bruckheimer/Bay audience will get when first watching this movie. It's only natural for one to expect over-the-top action sequences from the first frame to the last. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, as mentioned earlier Bay decides to pay more attention to plot & character development.<br/><br/>Does that mean the adrenaline junkie will be left out in the cold? Hell No! When the need arises Bay is not shy to show-off his new set of tricks without being far too excessive like he did in his last stint behind the camera on 2003's ""Bad Boys II"". He is to me the best American director who can shoot American style action. I don't mean the rip-off Hong Kong film techniques with all the slow motion, wire-work and gun play. This is good old' American action with death defying chases, explosions and special effects. There has never been a moment in any one of his movies where the action looks out of place, fake or unnecessary. Sure go ahead and mention the terrible scenes on the meteor from ""Armageddon"", jackass.<br/><br/>Here he ups the ante every chance he gets. He even manages to top the car chase sequence from ""Bad Boys II"". The sequence is thrilling and flawlessly captured. The ""Transformers"" movie adaptation is going to benefit from having his name attached to it.<br/><br/>I was never crazy for the plot when I first heard of it and true indeed the whole movie feels like an amalgamation of multiple sci-fi movies. The genre is vast with possibilities yet most Hollywood movies continue to take the same old path. However, writers Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci should be credited for getting the elements packaged perfectly. By the time the end credits roll the viewer what he/she paid for - a good story, action and a believable climax.<br/><br/>All this is good and dandy but credit should also be awarded to the actors who lift this movie from being another run-of-the-mill tent pole extravaganza. Ewan McGregor once again proves why he is one of the best actors this generation has. I don't think many, if any, actors could have pulled the doppelganger act as well as he does.<br/><br/>I've only seen Scarlett Johansson in one movie (""In Good Company"") and it was hard to judge her performance in that movie due to the limited scope her character got. Here she plays Jordan Two Delta, one half of the lead pair. After her initial appearance in this movie I was worried she would sink it. Her constant gasping, blank stare and lack of emotive abilities bugged me for much of the first act but fortunately she gets into character soon after.<br/><br/>The movie isn't missteps no matter how minor. Believe they are very minor but noticeable nonetheless. My first gripe with the movie is the convenient end to the chase sequence. For someone to survive something like that would really take a miracle. And the ""Jesus must love you"" excuse just doesn't cut it. You'll understand after you view this movie. The second contains spoilers so I won't share it with you. Just take note that it appears towards the climax.<br/><br/>Those are of course very minor problems I have with the movie. As a whole it is highly entertaining if a little predictable. How I wish they had tackled some of the deeper issues present scarcely throughout the movie. I guess that would just be a little too much, too soon for Michael Bay fans to stomach."

I got to see a preview tonight, the audience actually applauded when it was over. Don't get all bent out of shape with the Logans Run (a great movie btw) references, it still has it's own twist, and the chase/action scenes are some of the best ever. Since the theater was packed to the gills for a freebie, we sat in row 4, and I think it was even better seeing all the action up-close. Go see it, better than the rest. I would love to see the after effects of the clones meeting their makers, and having to live in the world alongside them. That would have made the story complete for me.

"pogo747","5","1","7","14 December 2005"," extremely mediocre
","I didn't expect much from this movie, and I wasn't disappointed. It's another brainless action movie from Michael Bay. Like his others, leave your brain at the door.<br/><br/>The story is rather unoriginal, feeling mostly like the book Brave New World, a bit like Gattacca, Total Recall, Minority Report, bits of the Matrix, and other parts of movies glommed together, especially with some of the visual imagery. One really distracting thing is how Bay shot this movie. His television commercial and music video backgrounds really bear out here and don't serve the style of the movie well at all. Lots of quick cuts, pans, and shots from far away, rotations of landscapes... lots of scenes where the viewer isn't given more than 1 or 2 seconds on each cut, making it feel like MTV. This is fine for a Subaru SUV commercial, but not for this movie.<br/><br/>Some really stupid and obviously out of place technology here too. Most of the world looks exactly like today (2005), except for the hover trains and the Star Wars landspeeder. (Maybe McGregor made a deal with George Lucas).. hover trains that float stories above the ground, like in The Fifth Element, yet all the other cars drive on the ground.. The future doesn't look very futuristic at all.<br/><br/>Another annoying thing is the really obvious Microsoft product placements! In one of the early scenes, there's a plug for the XBOX (yet in 2050, Microsoft hasn't made an XBOX 5.. it's just the normal XBOX)... later, we get an MSN butterfly logo right in our faces. I don't know about you, but I find product placements extremely distracting and they cheapen any movie, forcing me to think about the product than the story, taking me right out of the experience.<br/><br/>McGregor's performance is weak and his American accent is horrid. Sean Bean is great as usual. Djimon Hounsou I liked and would've like to see more of. All in all, a terribly incohesive movie with huge gaping holes. A lot of the exposition is simply dummied down dialogue that flat out explains things to you. It assumes you're an idiot. (""this is a $500,000 car""... duh as if I couldn't draw that inference myself). Good if you want to turn off your brain, otherwise, watch any of the other movies this one tries to imitate."

","Like all contentious themes, the theme of this movie is ever old but also ever new. The story-line or script of this movie read like the pages of the medical horror novels by Robin Cook , of the couple that I have read, Fever and perhaps more appropriately Coma or even mindbend. But apart from the chill and the fright it causes, Is there a valid point this movie is trying to make, and is there a relevant message this movie is trying to communicate and to convey, and is there a real warning this movie is trying to sound or is it raising a false alarm ?<br/><br/>Pardon my biblical references, but I cannot restrain myself. In scientific circles the genetic make up or the biological signature of an individual is referred to as his DNA. No doubt in this genetic characterization or genetic code as one might prefer to call it, some basic and fundamental characteristics of an individual's genetic make up would be fixed, constant, non-changing and, eternal which would be its smallest component but also its most central and its most critical and its most vital component, which part I would liken after Jesus's resurrection to be the indestructible seed of Christ sanctified and sealed by the holy spirit sown in the heart of every individual.Unfortunately this might also be the hidden or the invisible or the indecipherable part of the individual's genetic make up, for obvious reasons. The rest of the DNA would be the part which serves as the soil for this seed, in other words it would be the part which changes over time, but then the question is how is this transformation or change caused and effected ? Are the character traits manifest and displayed by an individual the result of his DNA, or is the DNA of an individual a characterization and a representation of not just the inherited character traits, but also the acquired as well as the developed and ingrown character traits, be they natural or un-natural as a result of the choices made by the individual himself. This latter point of view, which is the more accurate clearly allows for the existence of free-will and makes moral choice an integral part of the genetic make up of an individual and grants each and every individual total and absolute freedom and control to as they say grow and to develop his own character traits or so to speak to make and to form his own DNA, because choice is always the most crucial factor.Most certainly, it will not be true that the DNA of an individual is what makes that individual, rather the other way around, what an individual has chosen to make of himself is what makes his DNA. A direct consequence of this fact is that artificially and forcefully changing and altering the genetic make up or DNA of an individual may not necessarily bring about the desired change in the character traits of that individual, and even if it does; the change will not be a lasting and a permanent one. For instance if for whatever reasons valid or invalid, an individual unfortunately happens to be an alcoholic and a drug addict thereby given to and prey to all forms of intoxication, no amount of complete blood transfusions or going a step even further no amount of complete, heart, kidney, liver, lung , and every other organ transplants, of the unhealthy individual with those of another healthy individual including those of Jesus himself can change the person and transform the person into a non-addict for good, unless the individual willingly, lovingly and voluntarily, well and truly desires to change and transform himself by choosing to be good soil for the seed of Christ already sown in that person."

","""Just cause people wanna eat the burger doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow"". What substantiates humanity? Is it conscience? The organic process of three billion years worth of evolution? What if human life could be synthesised, and would moral implications outweigh selfish benefits? The Island raises these questions and is a blockbuster that time has left to ruin. Eclipsed by an array of studio manifestations. Yet, like many dabbles into the merge of entertainment and philosophy, it remains another film that is unable to fully exercise its grandiose concept. A feature more concerned about explosive carnage than ethical dialogue.<br/><br/>With that, Michael Bay's sci-fi action extravaganza is one of the most frustrating film experiences one can endure. Because at its core, whilst other classics such as 'Logan's Run' may have donated crucial components, it's bursting with conceptual flavour. In the near future, a structured isolated civilisation remains a ""contamination-free"" zone where its inhabitants participate in a lottery that could send them off to the paradisiacal retreat simply known as ""The Island"". However, one inhabitant starts to question the legitimacy of the world he is residing in, unfolding a series of events that will change his life.<br/><br/>The Island is a feature of two halves. One good, one bad. The first fraction of the plot is a contemplative cerebral sci-fi utopia. Philosophy coinciding with morality. Tredwell-Owen's generous script may spoon-feed every line of information, including the questioning of God and the omnipotence of creationism, but he does so through expressive world-building. When the truth of the isolated compound hits Lincoln Six Echo in the face, the elaborate planning and thought process that has been injected into the concept shines brighter than Johansson's smoothly filtered forehead. It's brilliant! Tantalisingly tangible on the morality compass, directly involving you to answer the philosophical conundrum that powers the narrative. McGregor and Johansson create semi-realistic portrayals, aside from the forced interactions that plagued the artificial chemistry between them, which elevated the ongoing mystery for the first half.<br/><br/>Then, inevitably, the realisation happens. The truth is encountered. Michael Bay slithers out of his crawlspace to seize this opportunity, his moment, to unleash mayhem in his trademark style. Car chases, running chases, hover bike chases, credit card chases. Chase after chase after chase. It. Does. Not. Work! He completely annihilated the initial meticulous storytelling with the first hyper-stylised action sequence. Why? Why spend a decent hour of the film world building and providing insight to existentialism, only to then subsequently provide mundane repetitive action sequences that hold little to no memorability just to quench the thirst of teenage boys begging for explosions? It's lunacy, it really is. The two tones do not amalgamate as one. Characterisation, dialogue, inclusive storytelling and solid direction were instantly crushed by the magnitude of Bay's dependency for action. It infuriates me to an incalculable degree (can you tell?)! That's without mentioning the sheer velocity to which product placements are thrown in your face every other minute.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, The Island is one of Bay's better features and I still moderately enjoyed it. I know, I know, that's not saying much, but still. The concept is sound, almost original and seamlessly utilises a dystopian future to critique the present. Yet it saddens me that Bay believes he has to throw in expendable action sequences to keep us entertained, essentially destroying his own work. So close, yet so far!"

","Hello, guys. This is Sam Whitacre and this is my first review on IMDb. And I'm gonna take a look at The Island. It was directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and Transformers). And I know what you're thinking, ""What's this? The new generation of the movie from Michael Bay?"" I think it could be an explanation as I should review this. All right. Let's get this review started. Ready? Let's get to it.<br/><br/>The film starts with Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor, Star Wars prequel trilogy) who wakes up from his nightmares at Merrick Industries as he misses a left shoe. When he lets someone get a chance, he would have another color. When the lottery starts, the Island winner goes to Starkweather Two Delta (Michael Clarke Duncan, The Green Mile) as Gandu Three Echo (Brian Stepanek) disturbs the elevator. When Lincoln lines up, he tries to have bacon for his breakfast, but the clerk doesn't want to. Instead, she surprises Lincoln with an oatmeal.<br/><br/>As for Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson, Marvel Cinematic Universe), she orders five pieces of bacon and gives them to Lincoln. Afterwards, he runs to visit Dr. Bernard Merrick (Sean Bean, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy) as he gives Lincoln the brain scan from the microsensors in his eye. Meanwhile, he works with his friend Jones Three Echo (Ethan Phillips) at the department. Suddenly, Lima One Alpha (Siobhan Flynn) breaks her water while pregnant when her baby is about to come out. The workers take her to the hospital. After the work, he goes to visit James ""Mac"" McCord (Steve Buscemi, Monsters, Inc.) where they have a conversation. After this, he sees a moth and he puts it in the matchbook.<br/><br/>When he works, he sees the doctors prepare to make Three Helo healthy. Afterwards, Lincoln takes the moth to his room and puts it in the glass. Lincoln and Jordan play a fighting video game on Xbox as she wins. When Lincoln wakes up, he accidentally finds the shocking lie about going to the Island. The Censors kill Lima and cut Starkweather open to seal his liver after he runs from the operating theater. Lincoln goes to Jordan as he takes her to the outside world after he becomes contaminated.<br/><br/>Back in Merrick Industries, Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou, Gladiator) makes an agreement with Merrick after he makes a speech about the agnate with his former friend Dr. Whitman (Max Baker). Back at the outside world, Lincoln and Jordan find Mac at the Aces & Spades bar in Arizona.<br/><br/>In the bathroom, he tries to tell Mac about the lie, but is interrupted by Ed the Trucker (Eric Stonestreet, Identity Thief) He takes them to his home with Suzie (Shawnee Smith, Saw franchise). Instead of asking for his permission, they ask Mac for his help. Mac takes Lincoln and Jordan to the station in Yucca after Lincoln urinates micro-sensors in the urinal. When Mac sees a mercenary, he calls them out to run to the train before a mercenary kills him.<br/><br/>They run to the train which stops to New York City. They find the MSN booth as they search for their sponsors Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan. When Jordan searches for Sarah Jordan, her son calls and sees agnates, finding out to be his mother. When the police arrive, they arrest them as he tells them to search for Tom Lincoln in California.<br/><br/>When they stop, a truck kills the police car. Jordan and Lincoln hop out of the car as Laurent's members try to shoot the officers down. They run to the truck with train wheels. Lincoln unchains them, killing his members. When Laurent stops, he calls out a flying vehicle known as Black Wasp to take out the truck. When the truck is shot down, Lincoln takes out the pilot and rides on it with Jordan to fly into the building.<br/><br/>They land on the logo as the members shoot the logo as it falls down. Lincoln and Jordan are saved. Back in Merrick Industries, Gandu tells Merrick about the flying bug. He injects him by poisoning his neck with the needle. Merrick forces them to bring him a list of all the Echos in active population.<br/><br/>In the morning, they arrive to Tom's house in California. When they enter, Lincoln gets whacked by his sponsor with a golf club. He tells his sponsor what he seems in his house. When Tom calls Merrick Industries from his phone, he says the F-bomb. When Tom and Lincoln drive to the news studio, Tom attempts to kill his sponsor, but they fight each other in a Cadillac Cier.<br/><br/>When they arrive in Michigan Central Station, Lincoln tricks Laurent into shooting Tom. When he returns home, Jordan realizes him as they have sex. Meanwhile in Merrick Industries, Merrick tells Whitman to dispose over $200 million worth of product by poisoning them or a recall.<br/><br/>The next day, when they escape, Lincoln sees the holographic power grid. He can shut it down so they would see the truth. Back in Merrick Industries, the harvesters poison the clones.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lincoln dresses up like Tom while Jordan gives children ice cream from Ben & Jerry's until she gets arrested by Laurent. Lincoln comes back to Merrick Industries as he walks with Whitman. Lincoln knocks Whitman down with the gun as he walks to the holographic room. Meanwhile, Jordan is about to be hacked until she shoots a censor in the leg as she takes the Tri-Key and his walkie-talkie. When Lincoln comes out of the room, Jordan tells Lincoln to shut the hologram down after the mass winnings.<br/><br/>As for Jones Three Echo, the censor takes the clones to the Island. When Jordan arrives, she sees the clones heading to the island. Laurent arrives as he attempts to kill Jordan, he prefers to help her out.<br/><br/>When Lincoln arrives at the hologram room, he tries to shoot the glass door. Instead, he shuts it down. Meanwhile, Jordan and Laurent force the censors to open the door. When a censor opens the door, he sets the clones free.<br/><br/>Merrick shoots Lincoln with a grappling hook. Lincoln fights Merrick as the hologram room explodes then Lincoln shoots Merrick in the neck. Merrick and Lincoln swing as the clones run free then Merrick dies. When the clones run outside, they see the blue sky. Lincoln and Jordan kiss as they watch Laurent leave with a smile.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, Lincoln and Jordan sail to the Island from the boat named ""Renovatio"" which translates to ""Rebirth"" in Latin.<br/><br/>So, what did you think of my review? Does it have spoilers? I think it has. It also has product placements in the movie. And it uses elements from ""Logan's Run"", ""The Matrix"", ""THX 1138"", ""The Thirteenth Floor"", and ""Gattaca"".<br/><br/>I think ""The Island"" is actually the hottest action movie of 2005. So, I hope you enjoy my review and let me know if it's helpful. Thanks for reading."

","Maybe it's an expectation thing, I read some of the reviews and got the impression that this is bad, so I was quite surprised that I enjoyed the movie. <br/><br/>At the start everything is a little bit confusing, you don't quite know what you are looking at, but you get a feeling that this could be one of the dystopian, futuristic movies (I thought that idea of the Island was a bit like the one in Black Mirror, but that wouldn't be fair because Black Mirror was years later than this movie, but you get the gist.) But then everything became clearer as Lincoln Echo Six kept questioning his world. <br/><br/>As the plot went on, I realised nothing would describe this movie better than 'bastardisation of Brave New World and Never Let Me Go', what with creating human beings from pods and using them for body organs or surrogacy, the only difference is, The Island being an action movie, it has a much brighter ending than the two aforementioned pieces of literature. And, admittedly, much more adrenaline rush. <br/><br/>I was kind of conflicted about the rating, because these days dystopian themes are as clichÃ©d as it gets, but it was good entertainment, so I will give it 7 out of 10. <br/><br/>Also, Sean Bean dies in this one too."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","0","1","3 April 2016"," Pure cinematic nirvana
","I love The Island, because it breaks ranks from Michael Bay's mostly uniform career and gives us entertainment where story is as important as action, which can't be said for most of his films. Don't get me wrong, I love his destructive maelstrom of a career to bits (except Transformers and Pain & Gain. Those are shameful.), it's just nice to get a movie from him with something to latch onto besides just... boom crash smash. His visual setups are like fire dancing on the retinas, but with The Island we get to see what's behind those eyes and actually get a concept to explore along with our helping of razzle dazzle. Now this type of story has been done before, in stuff like Logan's Run or the lesser known Clonus Horror, and obviously this time around the story is jazzed by a considerable amount of chromed up energy and adrenaline. In the far future, a group of people are kept inside a gargantuan facility and told that the world's population has been nearly wiped out by a contamination. Only one untainted zone remains: The Island. It's a place where some take off to, after winning a much touted 'lottery' that allows them access. Only, they aren't going to any such place at all. They are selected based on the need for organs, spare biological matter and baby carriers for their human counterparts, the rich and affluent. They're dormant cattle, so to speak, clones awaiting empty promises. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is one such individual, a curious fellow who first suspects something is wrong with their utopian existence, and once confirmed knows he needs to get out. Dragging along his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) he makes a harebrained run for it, escaping the facility and venturing into the world outside, which is anything but contaminated. I like what Bay did with the production design; Things aren't too wacky or space agey, and more or less that same as now, but accents like flying motorbikes or massive additions to existing skyscrapers let us know how brave of a new world it is. Lincoln and Jordan suffer considerable culture shock as they flee, and it's amusing to see the childish way they react to simple things like a telephone, or ordering drinks at a bar. The facility's Director, an arrogant son of a bitch named Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) sends a team of off the books ex special forces dudes after them, led by Laurent (Djimon Hounsou gets the best moments out of the film, the only actor who can stop the momentum dead in its tracks with his soulful performance). From there a lot of it is a deafening roar filled with chases, car crashes, fights and a spectacular highway chase that will wake up the tenants both above and below your apartment. Yes, Bay just can't help throwing in colossal action scenes where they aren't particularly needed, and complain if you must, but if it's really that much of a wrench in your enjoyment of the actual story going on around it, then use such interludes for a bathroom break or to go apologize to the neighbors for the racket your speakers are kicking up. You can only hope for Bay to reign it in so much, the dude just loves his action. Ask him to direct a Jane Austen adaptation and you can bet your hat he'd throw in a fireball or two in just for good measure. It's his passion, and I don't resent people for what they love to do. In any case it's a terrifically fun piece. McGregor and Johansson are pitch perfect, as they begin to clue in about the world around them, lashing out in anger over what's being done to them and becoming quite resourceful. Bean resists the label of villain with his performance, branding Merrick as an idealist whose breakthrough blinded him into extremism, from which there is no turning back. Steve Buscemi shows up bearing kindly comic relief as a tech worker who assists in their escape. Michael Clarke Duncan is very affecting in one scene as a clone who finds out the truth the worst way possible. There's also work from Shawnee Smith, Chris Ellis, Max Baker, Glenn Morshower and an incredibly bizarre cameo from an uncredited Kim Coates. Steve Jablonsky composes what I believe to be his finest, most stirring work and the best score to date in a Bay flick, adding to the sweeping scope and pure cinematic current that this one soars on. One of my favourites, highly recommended."
"LazloArcade","3","0","3","24 January 2016"," Exactly What You Expect- Big Budget
","**SPOILERS** Okay, now that I've seen three of Michael Bay's films I understand his 'thing' as an artist. He's basically a twelve year old boy with millions of dollars. But, like, the sort of twelve year old who rides a dirt bike behind a trailer park, drinks the leftover beers he finds in communal spaces, throws firecrackers at stray cats and scopes out females twice his age. Basically, Bay is a simple-minded idiot with nothing new or interesting enough to be considered anything more than lucky in the industry. <br/><br/>He's not subtle. Not creative. Not deep. He's a what-you-see-is- what-you-get sort of artist and has marketed himself on what he does best- action. The only reason why anyone would ever see any Bay film is for the action. Screw the characters and story, if there's a reason why Bay keeps getting hired to direct, it's because he delivers with explosions, metal scraping metal and thousands upon thousands of dollars in collateral damage. So, in that regard, the film did what it was supposed to; provide ample action scenes and sprinkle in a little plot here and there. <br/><br/>If The Giver, The Matrix and Aeon Flux didn't exist, I'd say the story was passable. But it was yet another dystopia reality film which means it demanded a flair of originality. <br/><br/>The time the story takes place was left pretty arbitrary but if I know human nature like I do, I think it's safe to say that there's one predictable reaction to what's practically meeting a farm cow that suddenly gained existentialism- fear and violence. Over the course of time, humans have proved that the appropriate response to something new, confusing, surprising and scary is to lash out. Caution overpowers curiosity. I believe the moment Sean Bean and Steve Buscemi's characters recognized defiance and cognition in the main character, they would've quarantined and/or killed him. Considering these organ donors were kept so hush-hush from the public, you KNOW it's a secret for good reason. Why would they go to such lengths to keep them hidden then turn a blind or curious eye when there's a threat of the farm cow going public?<br/><br/>So I get that the only people who can afford a farm cow/organ donor would be the incredibly wealthy. But I got really hung up on the occupations of the two main benefactors and how it seemed like a portrayal of bad-ass lucrative jobs according to gender. Thus, an automotive designer and a porn star. Wow. No subtleties there huh? Just a dude who draws sick motorcycles and a chick who takes a penis or two on camera. Michael Bay surprised no one by providing a female support character who's role was to serve as something to bounce dialogue off of, provide character development (for the main character) and most importantly, just look hot for the audience. That's Bay's thing; the female characters in movies serve as hot pieces of meat that help further dialogue. They're pretty unessential to the story. They're just accessories. And I think the two occupations of the main characters serve as good proof of Bay's opinion on gender roles. <br/><br/>So clearly this is not the movie to watch if you're into gender equality. Back to the action though. Like I said, this is probably the only reason to see a Bay film. If you're like me, though, once you've seen one five minute action scene from Bay, you've seen them all. So I didn't have fun watching The Island at all. In fact I skipped the action scenes to see more plot development. In the end, I didn't finish the film because it was so unrewarding in every aspect. <br/><br/>If I liked all the needless action, I'd say those scenes made the movie worth watching. But as someone who rolls their eyes with every Michael Bay explosion, I can safely say The Island had nothing worthwhile in it. <br/><br/>**SPOILER-FREE CONCLUSION** Coming from someone who doesn't wet themselves over expensive and elaborate CGI action scenes and car chases, this movie is a complete waste of time. The story has been done before and the one original twist doesn't makeup for anything. The behavior is unrealistic. The main characters are so uninteresting and essentially echoes of every main characters in every Bay film. Once again, Bay demonstrates that he has a basic understanding of film and when given basically all the money he could ask for, produces what you'd expect a twelve year old prepubescent Hot Wheels fanatic to make. The action scenes are predictably very well rendered and well made and the highlight of any Bay film (if you like that stuff). This was a film made by an idiot, for idiots, hence I rate it 3/10. Points scored for big budget and notably good actors. Points lost for being a twelve year old's fever dream."

","The Island (2005) is a very high octane, action packed, well written, and intriguing movie. Scarlett Johansson and Ewan Mcgreggor do a great job as the two leads, they had awesome characters and they portrayed them really well! Sean Bean was also very good in his twisted character with a sort of god complex. The whole plot of the island is very intricate and clever. I really loved the action sequences and the violence in this movie, none of it was graphic and it was all fun and entertaining to see. Michael Bay did a really great with this movie. I don't care what people say, I think he's a talented film director, and he directed the island very well. The dialogue between and the script was all great and well put together. Dijimon did a good job as well, he was intense and very into the character. Ewan and Scarlett really did have great chemistry together! You could really tell that the love and the feelings between their characters were real and true, no one in this film ""phoned in"" their performance, I was thankful for that. This movie is deeper and has more heart than I expected, it really reached me and some scenes were emotional because it was so sad. I applaud Michael bay and the entire cast and crew of the island! Job well done! 9/10."
"that_movieguyxx","9","0","1","12 October 2015"," The Names??
","An excellent movie. Vastly underrated. A lot of action movies dedicate the plot to hot women and big guns. This movie was not like that. It had the perfect combination of Drama, Action, and Romance (and even as a guy, I can appreciate it when it's not blown out of proportion, like in CF's). However, I'm a little confused about the names of the clones in the movie. We find out that the final titles in their names mean how old they are (Echo:3 Delta:4; etc.) And, the first titles we later figure out are the last names of their sponsors (people who had them made). But we are never told what the numbers in the middle mean (or maybe I missed it). Lincoln ""6"" Echo, Jordan ""2"" Delta..? I think it means what number they are in their generation off the assembly line (so to speak), but I'm not sure. Anyone have any ideas??"
"stdaganov","3","0","1","4 March 2015"," Oh, no, it turned into a 'formulaic script'
","It started with one of the most important moral issues of the world's relentlessly coming futuristic robotic hi-tech future. And it had the potential to hit me, to improve me (like Neil and Anna sang in the opening of the 87th Oscars) - just like one of the old 1990s best. And then: a disaster! It developed in a highway car chase, a helicopter downtown chase, and a fall from a skyscraper, miraculously survived, without the help of Spiderman or Batman!<br/><br/>How it would hit me (my version):<br/><br/>When they escape, they manage to connect with the real Sarah Jordan. They find her gravely ill in her house, explain to her what is happening, and she tells them to run away and hide, while she will be calling the police and the media. Whether she actually did that, remains to be seen. The two clones arrange a meeting and separate, Six Echo goes to the house of the real Lincoln, but it turns out that he is a real jerk, just like in the actual movie, and calls the henchmen, instead of the authorities. They attack and mistakenly kill the real Lincoln. 6 Echo remains in his house, acquiring his identity. The henchmen are now off for 2 Delta. She awaits on that swing, and she is thinking about sick Sarah Jordan, and her small child (put several good flashbacks) - waiting - after having used the Internet, trying to contact with media (isn't there free media still there, in this futuristic America?) Unfortunately, they manage to track her, because of the card she is using to connect, and instead of the journalists she awaits, she sees the coming henchmen. Now she realizes that there is no escape, starts crying, bends down her head (this would absolutely break me), and finally surrenders to her fate.<br/><br/>Carrying Jordan Two Delta (or beautiful Scarlett, in my own view) back to the killing center, the black paramilitary starts to develop a little bit of a crush on her (who wouldn't, for beautiful Scarlett - even gays and straight women would). He says to her: ""What did you think? That you can escape? You shouldn't even try, you didn't have a chance! You're a clone, not a human being!"" To which she replies: ""At least I'm going to save a life! While you are just a killer!"" Only that, no more conversation.<br/><br/>Then they can show how she is being sedated, while crying and trembling, although they shouldn't show additional Repo Man style surgical details, to avoid being rated R.<br/><br/>Then the black guy (who already has started to have second thoughts about this Nazi stuff) goes in the morgue depository, where the remains of gutted Jordan Two Delta are awaiting to be incinerated for further cover up. He looks at her remains (still beautiful in death). He has some flashbacks of the things he has done and witnessed, including the way the black football player clone (The Green Mile convict, good role!) was dragged down to the operation room, while in horror, realizing what is happening. Then he looks again at the gutted body (beautiful Scarlett, with serene face), and finally snaps! He goes through the building with scary determination, a cold stone face, and accompanied by some bad, alarming music, bursts in the cabinet of the main culprit, this spectacled modern neo-tech Dr Mengele, and shoots up (and all over) him, Sarah Connor's style (although she couldn't kill the computer scientist face to face - this one, however, knowing what they both have been doing recently, empties his whole magazine, in Dr Mengele's spectacled face, torso and a**).<br/><br/>And then: another change for the better, hope finally arrives: it turns out, that the FCSA (Fascist Capitalist States of America) is not that fascist, and still has democratically elected, conscious and responsible political power; it turns out that there is at least one communist thing there: a free uncensored public access to the Internet (so 2 Delta call worked, although too late for her); it turned out that the real Sarah Jordan also called the police, and after they made some checks, they realized something is smelling about this corporation, up to the clouds, and needs urgent intervention; it turns out that corporate media has not forgotten yet what made Americans great in the first place, i.e. FREEDOM. Yes: freedom! So media helicopters and police helicopters finally arrive, to liberate this concentration camp, built in the land of the free, and the home of the brave.<br/><br/>And you could keep the scene with the clones exiting freely outside. Although what would they do in the Arizona/Nevada desert - go to Las Vegas to play the casino? These people are badly misused abused brainwashed victims, they need years of counseling and therapy!<br/><br/>Of course, in order for all of that to work, you would need to remove idiotic moments, like stupid Steve Buscemi's comic relief. I mean: how can I know that private military contractors - merciless killer henchmen - are coming to murder me in a cover up, probably within minutes, and still have time to explain to a potentially retarded 15-year-mind reserve parts clone, about which is the suitable dress (unless, of course, I have already ridden a multi-megaton nuclear bomb, like a toy horse, while onto the surface of an asteroid, and while on a mission to save the Earth). If I was in such situation, I would c**p myself in fear, not do the comic relief.<br/><br/>Epilogue: The actual (now cured) Sarah Jordan, accompanied by her small son, enters the premises of a green, calm graveyard. There, she approaches a tombstone with a name and inscription: ""Jordan Two Delta. A HERO: SAVED A LIFE"". And she puts some flowers.<br/><br/>It would be like a nuclear shell exploding. It would cut through the heart. It would make young brainwashed Americans think. Instead of that: another formulaic script. What a pity!"
"blazesnakes9","3","0","1","24 August 2014"," Starts off good, but falls short
","The Island is a film directed by Michael Bay, who's previous work were Armageddon, Bad Boys 1 and 2, The Rock and Pearl Harbor. His previous movies were good, but not great popcorn action films that made a fortune at the box office. Yet even he can make several duds, too. Pearl Harbor, Armageddon and Bad Boys 2 were examples of overblown, loud, special effects duds. This movie however, has a great beginning, but the problem is that it looks like it was directed by a different filmmaker.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2019, where citizens live underneath the Earth, cutting off their communication to the outside world. The main character of the story, Lincoln Six Echo, (Ewan McGregor), is one of those citizens. His day first starts off with him losing an left shoe. Then, he goes down to the cafeteria, where he is not allowed to eat bacon due to his health record at the cafeteria. He does, however, forms an friendly relationship with a female citizen who lives in this society. Her name is Jordan Two Delta, (Scarlett Johansson). The beginning of the movie tells us that Lincoln has a recurring nightmare about driving a boat in the middle of the ocean and drowning. Of course, the movie does set up an very creepy side to this futuristic world. The one thing this society depends on is the lottery in which the inhabitants of the world can win a trip to go to the Island. But, what is the Island?<br/><br/>McGregor's character soon take his chance to escape from the underground society along with Johansson and soon enough, the two fugitives find themselves venturing out into the outside world. However, they are not accustomed with the new surroundings. Everything seems deserted and barren. Risking his life, Lincoln and Jordan decides to find out the answers by joining with another inhabitant from the underground world, (Steve Bucemi). Bucemi explains to the two that they are clones and since they are part of an genetically engineered society, they have no actual memory of their actual parents. Together, Lincoln and Jordan decides to seek out more answers when they arrive to Los Angeles. Right about there is where The Island goes completely wrong.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is very well directed with its inside look of this completely dystopian society. The art direction is very well done and I like how the citizens of this world wear different colored outfits to show what kind of identification or identity they are. McGregor and Johansson are good in their roles as the two clones, but sometimes I felt that their dialogue runs a little bit too simplistic. I also love the supporting cast including Steve Bucemi, who helps them get to Los Angeles and also the performance by Djimon Hounsou. He's particularly a good actor in this film. His job is to catch the two fugitives before they tell everyone back underground the truth about the Island.<br/><br/>But, what bothered me is the second half of the movie. This is when Michael Bay steps in. When McGregor and Johansson get to Los Angeles, I felt the movie slow down and came to a screeching halt when the two of them are being chased by Hounsou's goons. Like all of Bay's films, there's is a lot of action sequences. One example is the scene where the two clones hitch a ride in the back of a trailer carrying metal tubing. Throughout that entire scene, the characters are locked into a scene that isn't worth my time or my patience. It almost as if Michael Bay put these two actors on a treadmill and have them run through a series of dodging giant obstacles such as falling building debris, the metal tubing and a whole lot of smashed up cars. Not the least interesting.<br/><br/>The story is perhaps similar to those who've seen other science fiction movies where the protagonists escapes from their dystopian society and exposed the real truth behind all of the corruption. The movie Logan's Run is a perfect example. In that film, the two main characters escaped from their own world and venture into the outside world and sees the obvious difference between these two completely different worlds. Here, it is the same thing. As the special effects go, they are good, but not at all great. The futuristic world of Los Angeles in the year 2019 has been a whole lot more better in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner since it had a dark and depressing atmosphere. In The Island, it isn't even interesting or good enough.<br/><br/>I guess Michael Bay had a very good movie going for him, I imagine. But, the fact that his over-the-top action sequences get in the way of a predictable and eye-opening story that doesn't work. I know that Michael Bay isn't the best director of the action genre, but I can't give him the credit of putting in a mindless and loud action sequence. If The Island kept going with its story about human cloning and ethics, then maybe it would've been great. I really love to see more movies about human cloning. I know that they made a decent one called The 6th Day with Arnold Schwarznegger, but I am still waiting to see a serious science fiction that really challenges the audience toe explore the world of human cloning, not highway accidents. â˜…â˜… 1/2 2 1/2 stars."

Sean Bean is a great actor playing a doctor running a strange facility that raises human beings, training them one day for their release into an uncontaminated Island. McGregor is the curious lead who meets Johansson. Security is laughably lax in this ultra high tech facility, so bad that nobody even notices that McGregor leaves a floor tile blatantly out of place when he sneaks around. How dumb can everyone be?<br/><br/>Buscemi plays a completely out of place supervisor. He's got material to fuel McGregor's curiosity that should never even be in the facility. It makes no sense whatsoever. But it's there to unnecessarily further curiosity of our lead.<br/><br/>Hounsou is wasted as... I can't tel you. But he sounds like he's reading from a cue card. The dialogue is do awkward and dumb he seems to not believe it himself. Obvious questions are never asked. Obvious next steps are never explored. This is a Michael Bay film. ""Guys.... I need to get from the explosion scene to the car chase and then to the next action sequence. "" That's what this ""intelligent"" scifi film devolves into, making it the totally forgettable movie that it is.<br/><br/>Don't make the mistake of thinking this film is smart. It has a great premise but the Michael Bay execution sucks and is ""Transformers"" does Bladerunner = disaster. If you want totally mindless eye candy with HUGE plot holes (and I mean HUGE), then watch this forgettable film on a cable rerun. That's about the extent of it."

","This box office bomb lowered troubled DreamWorks selling price over a hundred million dollars and stalled a deal with Universal, before being bought out by Paramount. Considering the amount of product placement in The Island, the film should have practically been paid for. In fact, the whole film visually resembles a commercial. No matter how much Bay blames the actors for not being a big enough draw or the marketing failing, The Island's failures rest on his shoulders. The premise is an interesting one, about clones being harvested for their human counterparts. But the film is not really interested in that idea, it just uses that as a springboard for two clones on the run, who end up in a dumb action film. You might ask, why even bother to animate the clones and give them consciousness and identities if they are going to the butcher shop soon anyway - but the film tosses in a quick throwaway line to address that illogical premise. The organs failed without the human experience or human connections - top notch writing. Once on the run, our two uninteresting clones end up in a series of expensive chases, with lots of property damage, and are sought after by the super serious Djimon Hounsou - who's lines usually consist of ""do not let them get away, do not let them get away!"" I'm sure his henchmen needed the extra reminder not to let them get away. The Island is a soulless product that is overlong and the quickly edited action is repetitive and boring."

The oddities make me scratch my head mostly. It's not interesting enough for me to ponder. I also find all the brand names very annoying. Why the clones need brand names is beyond me. And why is there a holographic projection? Those are just two of the many questionable things. The movie also feels derivative of other better sci-fi. There are a lot of flashy bits and pieces to distract the audience. Once it switches after the escape, director Michael Bay uses all his expertise to make an above average action adventure movie.

","--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--<br/><br/>This one was a miss from the start. The promotional art for this film lead you to believe that it is supposed to be an action film; yet The Island is much more than that, but not in a good way. This movie suffers from a serious identity crisis, starting off as a much more interesting film than it ends up being. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are both top notch actors in their own right, however the convoluted story hinders any ounce of interest these two try and help occur along the ride. <br/><br/>The Island starts off as a film about a colony of people brought up to be almost the ideal society of individuals going about their seemingly endless and mundane daily routines; all whom long to win ""The Lottery"" which grants them access to an island in which they will live out the rest of their years in bliss. Obviously this is a rouse, and the plot is predictable, dated, and much less of a homage to classic Sci-Fi films than it thinks it is. Once Ewan and Scarlett's characters escape, the movie turns into a different film entirely, cutting out most of the sci-fi elements and getting more gritty. This grit, however, is big time filler and seldom interesting, making for a very long second act.<br/><br/>The cherry on top comes during the latter part of the film in which Michael Bay puts his directorial stamp on the film by going full on blockbuster with the special effects and action, almost like giving film goers what they probably expected to be seeing throughout the whole film as a climax rather than a theme throughout; which isn't very climatic in retrospect.<br/><br/>The Island represents everything that is wrong with blockbuster movies, and while it may be nowhere's near as bad as the second transformers film, it's hap-hazard narrative is disappointing and only understandable when by the numbers; and the whole package is undersold by never realizing the first half's potential. It hurts to see so much promise go to waste in terms of both actors and an opportunity to tell a great story, but lowered expectations and good old political undertones plagued this film into the obscurity it deserves. <br/><br/>Dare I recommend it? Even as a passing curiosity? Or for general film knowledge? Just for general film knowledge... for any other reason, no, I don't."

","Before watching this movie, I had a quite high expectations for this movie. And guess what? I ended up quite disappointed. This movie has great special effects and CGIs. Well actually, the first 1 and a half hour of this movie was really good, but then it fell apart and became just a mediocre sci-fi-action movie. <br/><br/>For me, one of the biggest problems about this movie is the character development. Scarlett and Ewan's chemistry is actually not that bad, but they barely show such emotions. This movie had a GREAT potential, especially if they had showed the character developments a bit more. This movie is too focused on the action, and forgot about character developments and humors. <br/><br/>If you were looking for an full action packed movie with mediocre story and great CGI, it's the absolute right movie.

","What I really like about this movie is the plot. At first you are always wondering, having doubts and speculations about whats really going on. Later on you are given clues and you start to put all the puzzle pieces together. After that the chase begins with good special effects, stunts and explosions.<br/><br/>The problem though is that sometimes it's too much. Like in the scene were Lincoln steals the flying bike and is suddenly an expert on it and is able to beat the specially trained men in the chase. In my opinion it would be better if he would steal an ordinary bike and loose them that way, he would know how because of memories from the real Lincoln. If that had happened, the scene were they fell 50 stories and somehow survived wouldn't have happened at all. Also what I consider a small flaw is all the technology in such a near future, like the flying trains. It would have been better if it was 2029 but not 2019 and if they would skip some of the unnecessary futuristic mechanics which are unrealistic.<br/><br/>Besides that the movie was great. The sets, the storyline, the music, the shots were all amazing. Ewan's acting was great and the acting overall was good.<br/><br/>Over all a great movie. It's sad to see all the negative reviews.

","Now what about the film that Michael Bay might list on his CV as his career low-point, but in reality it is the best thing he's made? In the future (2019 to be specific): Â• Everyone believes that the outside is ruined and barren. All life has moved underground.<br/><br/>Â• The only place pure and hospitable is the Island, a lottery is held on occasion with the lucky winner heading there, much to everyone's envy.<br/><br/>Â• Everyone wears white Puma tracksuits with white Puma socks and white Puma shoes.<br/><br/>Â• Those that don't wear black, and they are forever watching vigilantly. Looking after the 'white' wearing inhabitant's wellbeing and ensuring no-one broaches another's 'proximity'.<br/><br/>Â• Boats look cool and sexy (in dreams at least).<br/><br/>Â• The future is very future-ey.<br/><br/>Â• Everyone lives a pleasant but low key existence. Remaining bland and emotionless seems the name of the game.<br/><br/>Â• And everyone seems happy enough with thisÂ… Except Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), he has questions.<br/><br/>Why white? What about outside? Why do my Puma tracky-dacks bulge whenever Jordan Two Delta walks past? Why, why? WHY?!? The boss of the facility Merrick (Sean Bean) understands his curiosity but wants it suppressed, like everyone else's. A grease monkey engineer named Mac (Steve Buscemi) appears to know more but he ain't sayin'.<br/><br/>New white track-suited adult arrivals show up all the time with little knowledge or co-ordination to learn toddler-aged skills from scratch, and all the while everyone just goes on and on with the repetitive day to day, pausing only to watch the next lottery draw â€“ praying that their name comes up. We learn that the average intelligence of the inhabitants is that of a 15 year old, which begs the question with all the fine track-suited ladies about how none of the guys seem to know about sex?? Shortly after Lincoln's buddy Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannsen) has her number come up his inquisitive nature gets the better of him, upon learning the truth about the Island he immediately grabs Jordan and they runÂ… And run. And run. And run. For the rest of the two hour film.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou is a 'finder of missing persons' charged with locating the pair, and he is told in no uncertain terms just how important it is that they return to the facility asap, as ""It is bad for public relations if products go public"". He and his faceless crew maintain a dogged pursuit of the track-suited tandem all over future Los Angeles, wreaking havoc along the way.<br/><br/>There isn't much more to the film than that (when have Michael Bay films been head scratchers anyway?), the city background looks pretty, the Johannsen (and McGregor if you're into that sort of thing) foreground looks pretty and there is one cool scene on a bridge where the Puma'd pair are pursued on the back of a truck.<br/><br/>That's pretty much it really. Product placement is rampant â€“ should I really be surprised coming from the guy who made not one, not two but soon three films about a toy robot franchise? Everyone looks fresh as a daisy and in truth there isn't really much to dislike about The Island.<br/><br/>But there isn't that much to like either. And while being named Michael Bay's least offensive film (by me anyway) might not sound like too large a plaudit, it ensures that The Island will likely remain as the last Michael Bay film I ever saw (or will ever see).<br/><br/>One last one; some Johannsen nudity would've got this film a 7. (OK that's it.) Final Rating â€“ 5.5 / 10. Like the characters of Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta 'The Island' is a product; a flashy, good-looking but ultimately dumb and pointless product that is attractive to teenagers â€“ and in the case of Johannsen to guys of all ages (*I know enough right?*)."

Not by the script or character development (which is all right), rather by the visuals, from the modernistic, cool and clean interiors, through raw and sharp light, to things like the breathtaking Wally 118 or Cadillac Cien, this film is so visually stunning and wholesome it just blew me away. Yes, I confess. I'm a complete sucker for such things and modern style is the reason why I like 'The Island' so much. But apart from that it's a good film in it's own right. Nothing seems flimsy or cheap, nor does the action ever bog down. Bay has a lot of craft and I can't think of anyone else who can pull this kind of cinematography better. Absolutely worth buying, on Bluray especially."

","The Island, so nearly a great film, ends up merely a good film.<br/><br/>The first act is terrific. As we meet the inhabitants of this unexplained futuristic city, the puzzle of where, when, and how come is very pleasing. The most likely explanation seems to be some sort of riff on Logan's Run. Bits of the puzzle are supplied piecemeal, and each leaves us more puzzled than we were before.<br/><br/>Then act 2 kicks in, and the reveal isn't half as satisfying as the mystery which preceded it. However, it leads to some decent chase sequences, and Ewan McGregor and Steve Buscemi both get to have a little fun (not so with Scarlett Johansen, however, whose function is to serve as decoration, sounding board, light romantic interest, and occasional damsel in distress).<br/><br/>Act 3 simply wraps matters up and gives Sean Bean an opportunity to be the villain, which we already knew by then. Bean brings nothing more to his portrayal of the villain than he has brought to such parts many times before. Djimon Hounsou, however, lends a depth to a part which should have been one dimensional, and is probably the best thing in the film.<br/><br/>It passes a couple of hours well enough, but no better."

They took time to build up the characters in Logans Run which helped me to identify with them. This film was just a hotch potch of carelessly put together ""action"" scenes were mainly a blur. The noise of collapsing machinery is added to junk music which all contribute to a senseless mess. What is wrong with showing an establishing shot?

There is no dilemma, really. That's only the first thing I noticed. As for its atmosphere, the movie is generally acceptable, except that it wasn't very believable for me, since in the 'facility' things looked like we're in the 24th century, and outside, everything was about 21st. Also, the movie drags. Really hard. Entire scenes could have been cut off, not to mention that many scenes take 5 more minutes than required to poke your eyes out with something that was hinted slightly. It certainly makes sure you miss nothing. I sincerely think it can be watched at 2x speed without losing much (if any).<br/><br/>The acting is generally good, though.

I tried many times to find a plot hole, but this script is so-sly-it's-solid, predicting all the questions to already answer them somewhere in the movie, even swiftly. It's only slight matters like why they killed the woman that gave birth to the child?, how (Scarlett Johansson) reentered the foundation with a gun and nobody noticed?!, and how (Ewan McGregor) put the plastic bracelet around his original human's hand that quick?! But anyway, it is incontestably one of the finest, most complete, movies done by (Michael Bay) where, in such a rare time, the editing and the story harmonize smartly; which is something that I didn't witness in (Pearl Harbor - 2001), (Bad Boys 2 - 2003), or surely (Armageddon - 1999)! Although (McGregor) is so pale as an action hero, sometimes unconvincing, however nothing harmed the final product. If there is one thing that really bugged me, then it's the ending. I think that they left it like this just hoping for a sequel, since it got no much sense; for instance, where all of these clones would go? How the lead would live? I bet he stole the costly boat to sail with it at the last shot!<br/><br/>On a personal level, I hated ignoring the great potential of the story. I mean what a treasure indeed to make a perfect action that got meanings. In another treatment, (The Island) could have been a high sci-fi, with the same amount of fun, that fits for endless viewings. But it didn't utilize areas like the irony of one rich community that doesn't stand pain and wants to live forever on one side, and another poor one, with identical citizens, that got no will at all, being exploited for the sake of money and living well on the other side. Look also at the missing circle where the differences between the lead and his source; how the lead personifies the good in him, or abstracts his best as a human. Let alone the storyline of (Scarlett Johansson) and her original (the sick model and her baby) which turned into so trivial, rather forgotten, matter. Or the lost concept of the ""The Island"" itself; does freedom is the lost island of everyone? Does dreaming in a subdued constant society make its dreamer an island? Does humanity became an island in the world of today? You have to notice how ultimately the title was bigger than the final movie. And how this script just intellectually implies, as it has no time except for action and popcorn.<br/><br/>You have to notice also that the movies that speak about closed secret worlds became too many lately. Just remember (The Truman Show - 1999), (The Matrix - 1999), (The Village - 2004).. etc. where the trick is always on, and the people are always ruled by deceiver superiors who own the acknowledge, and control it evilly. I think it's one speech which comes from the fear of locked society, owned by foundations this round, where the human is nothing but a tool in the hands of richer masters, being used without will or consciousness. It's simply not the fear of another communism. No. It's the fear of fascism that got the ugliest of both; the communism and the capitalism. It's clear even in a work that just wants to be the polished product.<br/><br/>(The Island - 2005) is highly entertaining, but it didn't deliver intellectually as it did visually. And it's typical I think, since it's produced by another foundation which needs its products to be as pure as possible, without extra - especially deep - qualities. Now I dream of more intellectual, same entertaining, remake. Hmmm, maybe in another island!"

","This is pretty much your average action movie. The plot appears to be original and interesting for a Hollywood movie at first, but it is in fact a combination of Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Let_Me_Go) and the Matrix trilogy. I'm not sure whether the writers were even trying to put an original twist to this script. The only difference this movie has to those two titles combined is the ending (which I won't reveal, but it is cheesy).<br/><br/>The action sequences are good, but they slacked a bit on creating an interesting futuristic world. Most of the futuristic cars are just black Cadillacs or Chryslers, not to mention that the advertisement in this production is huge. Any of the brands featured in the movie display huge logos, which stay on screen for around twenty seconds. Nice and subtle.<br/><br/>The last paragraph is nothing more than picking at some minor flaws; what really ruined the experience for me was the (nonexistent) character development. One moment Scarlett Johansson is a happy little vegetable and the next she is jumping on the back of moving lorrys and shooting people in the hand with nail-guns.<br/><br/>5/10, American action movie for the simpleton, 4 points because it had Scarlett Johansson dressed in a tight suit."

","THE ISLAND....the finest film of 2005, you won't find a better action packed, thriller than this in all of 2005, It was very intense at moments and exciting. It makes you wonder and eager to know what will happen next. A different type of movie with a sublime storyline and cool action scenes. (Thanks to Michael Bay) let me tell you 2 things what make's the film so great. <br/><br/>1)acting:were shall i start the acting was brilliant, maybe the stars are not an A class listing but they did a great job at playing the roles of there character's. Ewan McGregor as Lincoln Six Echo / Tom Lincoln, Scarlett Johansson as Jordan Two Delta / Sarah Jordan, there are more i could name but these 2 were the main characters and did a real good job. 2)the plot: the story was well executed by director Michael Bay,very interesting storyline, that will leave you questioning at time and easy to follow,i won't put no spoilers in this comment but A man goes on the run after he discovers that he is actually a ""harvested being"", and is being kept along with others in a utopian facility, may not sound as exciting as the movie actually is. Michael Bay hit's the target with this plot. so if your a big fan of Michael Bay's films i recommend you watch this, because this may as well be his ""finest moment"". 9/10"

","If Michael Bay had not directed this movie, probably, it had the potential to stand out as one of the best films on moral and scientific issues related to cloning and stem cell research that were raging around the time the film was made. Instead, what you get out of it is a lot of clanging metal, flying bullets and choppers that completely knock off the subtlety aspect that the subject was meant to portray and sensitivity involved.<br/><br/>Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is among the few survivors of a global contamination who now live in a controlled environment with their diet, clothing and activity following a strict plan. The only thing that all residents there wish for is to win the lottery and go to ‘The Island’, said to be the last inhabitable place on earth. In what appears as utopia, Lincoln finds a live bug that leads him to question the oft told contamination theory.<br/><br/>Obviously, our hero needs a girl and who can get better than the young favorite Scarlett Johansson who plays Jordan Two Delta who has just won a lottery to the island. Just before she is whisked away to the purported island, Lincoln grabs her and flees. The outside world was just the trigger that Bay needed to add the unnecessary clang to the whole story, making the rest of the story a predictable second grade action film.<br/><br/>Despite starring Sean Bean one of the most effective villains who plays Dr. Merrick, the brain behind Merrick Laboratories that owns the facility, the film rarely delves into issues that actually strike the moral chord on cloning. The reference by henchman Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) on the African genocide and his qualms about killing agnates despite him being a baddie was a mere touch and go on the humane aspects.<br/><br/>Despites all its flaws, it makes quite a decent watch if shown on Television anytime. At the very least, the idea of such a facility for cloning is in itself a worthy concept however but marred by mindless action. From the star cast, McGregor still doesn’t seem in the role and Scarlett could probably have been given a bigger role than being a blonde eye candy. A wee bit of sensitivity and sensibility could have made the film memorable!"

","I had heard this film was about cloning, and obviously I knew three of the stars, but not much else besides that, and the fact that Michael Bay (Armageddon, Transformers) was directing made it more appealing. Basically Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) along with hundreds of other ""subjects"" are living a seemingly Utopian facility, and all of them hope to be chosen in the lottery to go to ""The Island"", supposedly the last place on Earth with no contamination. It is after Lincoln's friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) is chosen that his curiosity really hits a high when he explores the facility more, and what he discovers is very disturbing. The women, or the ""breeders"" give birth to a new baby, and then they are killed, and as for the men, he witnesses lottery ""winner"" Starkweather Two Delta (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan killed trying to escape. Lincoln and Jordan are now on the run from head Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean) and his many forces, and they finally see that ""The Island"" is only a hologram, and they are in a near remote part of a desert-like land. When they find him, James McCord (Steve Buscemi), a worker in the facility, reveals to them that they are clones, copies of their real selves, and ultimately insurance policy, i.e. if the real person gets sick, they have a clone with identical backup organs, blood and any other body parts. Lincoln and Jordan, real names Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan by the way, are now heading for the house of the real Lincoln (another McGregor) to get more answers. It is when the real Lincoln is killed that clone Lincoln poses as him to get back to the facility, and along with Albert Laurent (Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou), who you first thought was with Merrick, both reveal the truth to all other ""subjects"", and stop all other cloning and so forth. Also starring Ethan Phillips as Jones Three Echo, Brian Stepanek as Gandu Three Echo, Noa Tishby as Community Announcer, Siobhan Flynn as Lima One Alpha, Saw's Shawnee Smith as Suzie and Apollo 13's Chris Ellis as Aces & Spades Bartender. Apparently it might be inspired by the film Logan's Run, and I found elements near to events in The 6th Day, but whatever you think, it has some interesting conspiracy material, McGregor might not do the greatest American accent compared to regular Scottish, but the chase and action sequences more than make up for tiny, tiny flaws. Good!"

","This was my first experience with Michael Bay, since none of his previous movies really seemed to be my type of thing. He's sort of a punching bag for critics isn't he? It's like his name is now synonymous with bloated action films that have no feeling or depth. But I really enjoyed this one... maybe the fact that it was one of his less successful films is actually a good sign, who knows? It's basically a dystopian sci-fi -- it's obvious that the situation at the beginning of the film cannot continue and that there will be surprises or revelations, so the film earns whatever points it gets by the way it accomplishes the revelation. I very much liked that scene, with Michael Clarke Duncan's huge frame exploding through the lab where doctors are attempting to carve him up for organ donors. It's like the skit in Monty Python's ""Meaning of Life"" except it's serious -- live organ donors. I find the idea plausible in and of itself so that lends weight to the horror of this possible future. I think if this technology was available people really would take advantage of it because it's true that everyone wants to live forever.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is always a lot of fun and adds a lot of class to this movie. Scarlett Johansson can't act to save her life but at least she looks good in a jumpsuit. Steve Buscemi was very fun in the early scenes, I laughed when he had to tell Johansson's character not to wear the kinky nurse outfit as a disguise. I really enjoyed Ethan Phillips in his role too, very endearing. Sean Bean is a much better villain here than he was in ""National Treasure."" In the end the big effects scenes become a little too much. The character reversal for Djimon Hounsou's character was too predictable. You're not allowed to have a black villain these days, everybody knows that. But the photography in the very last scene was very stirring. I didn't care for the music in general. So I wouldn't say this was a great movie, but it was a very solid sci-fi film with some good ideas and some great action scenes."

","The Island is an entertaining film, a decent sci-fi adventure. The story of the movie is an underground facility has the last remains of humanity after an environmental disaster. The people lived in a controlled environment and the people lived in hope that they would be picked to go to the Island, the only safe place left on Earth. However, Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) starts to question the society he was living in and with Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), both make it to the real world. They discovery that everyone had been lied to, that the world was habitable and that they were really clones of the rich and famous.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Michael Bay, famous for big dumb action films like Bad Boys, the Rock, Armageddon and Transformers. The Island was Bay's first flop, but it is not his worst film. It is a little more intelligence and more subtle (I use these themes loosely). It does have good actions, which is what someone would expect from a Bay film. The film was set in 2019, and I believe that future world that was created in the film wasn't far-fetched and could possibly happen. The acting was decent, McGregor is also an actor I like. Johansson is a nice bit of eye candy and isn't a bad actress. Sean Bean is a good actor and plays the villain in the film, which he normally does. Steve Buscemi adds a bit of comic relief and an actor Bay likes to use. Michael Clarke Duncan, an other actor Bay likes, has pretty much a cameo role.<br/><br/>The films does have some problems. There is too much product placement, which I understand, but they is a limit to how much a film can get away with. Another example of a film with too much product placement would be Die Another Day. The film could have been a little shorter, but only a little. Also the film does have a few plot holes such as why don't more clones question the system they live in or why there is an Island or that sexually attraction is natural, no matter whether some has sex education or not.<br/><br/>However, the Island is good and is worth watching if on TV or a good priced DVD."
"Okonh0wp","5","0","1","11 March 2008"," Interesting but flawed
","Michael Bay usually achieves high grosses on films that are rejected by critics and most moviegoers of good taste. Richard Roeper called Bad Boys II the worst picture of the decade. Therefore, it was kind of odd that this 2005 film turned out to be a little bit the opposite: It completely bombed at the box office, making for Bay's lowest film to date, yet it might have been his most interesting film.<br/><br/>""The Island"" is a sci-fi film along the lines of Gattaca or I, Robot, set in some dystopian future, where the protagonist comes to the rescue of everything by transcending the limits of what the more rigidly stratified society places on him.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a futuristic factory that promises to prolong the lives of its clients through cloning the clinets and using the clones' organs for transplants. The clones live in this isolated world with implanted memories and the idea that there is no life outside of this world. They're made to perform tasks that lead to the operation of the factory, so that saves labor costs. The only salvation for the clones is the belief that they will be taken to a paradise called the island if they're selected in a lottery, but in reality when a clone wins the lottery, that means the client needs an organ and the clone is killed. Ewan MaGregor and Scarlett Johannson play two clones who somehow find out about this outside world and are on the lam from the people who run the factory because it's supposedly some sort of worst-case scenario if the clones should get out. Being a Michael Bay film, this is also an action film, and a great one at that.<br/><br/>While I'm a sucker for a good sci-fi film, and this is a fascinating concept, it seems like a flawed one as well. There seems to a complete ignorance of the fact that we've made a lot of progress in terms of harvesting replacement organs already that doesn't require building entire clones so there's a good chance a company like this could avoid all this morally gray area and the ensuing controversy. It seems as though this film was made from a script that was originally written well before the stem-cell controversy. Also, Sean Bean's character is not as morally significant to this universe as he believes he is because he can't make people as immortal as he says he can. He's just a glorified mad scientist organ harvester, and there's a point with many diseases beyond where a single organ replacement can save a life anyway.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, while the action is great, considering the quality of the cast, the acting is a little subpar. Ewan MaGregor has the challenge of playing two people interacting in conversation (like Nicholas Cage did in Adaptation, a role that earned him an Oscar nomination) and I applaud him for that, but with the exception of Sean Bean, I don't really feel like anyone gave a remotely memorable performance. I came to greatly appreciate the visual look of this universe, and I think that sci-fi films are heavily dependent on visual feel."

In general it is just a fun movie to watch with an interesting plot.

It had a very futuristic feel to it as well, and I really liked the whole color scheme of the movie. The opening scene of the movie was really artistically done as well.

","I'll see any movie with Steve Buscemi in it.<br/><br/>After twenty minutes, however, I was at the point of turning this one off: Buscemi still hadn't made his entrance; the setting, story and production were clinically confusing and seemed to be getting more so; and Ewan McGregor isn't an actor of much impact for me.<br/><br/>Fortunately, in the next two minutes, everything changed after McCord (Buscemi) talks with our hero, Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) alerting the viewer  me  that all is not perfect in paradise... and the rest of the story unfolds, as it should. So, if you see this movie, be patient  it's meant to be confusing in those first twenty-two minutes.<br/><br/>This is a story set in the future, presenting a scenario that is indeed possible, given the advances in genetics that we read about even today. The writers have simply extrapolated about a series of 'what-ifs' and allowed their fertile imaginations run riot.<br/><br/>The result is an action packed  more than enough for most action freaks, I think  pulsating hunt for Lincoln Six and his friend, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), as they set off to find out the secret of The Island. Along the way, there are action sequences that bear strong resemblance to thrillers such as Terminator, Aliens and others, as the two dodge and weave to stay alive. The special effects when they are on a truck carrying railway gear and being chased by the bad guys is particularly well done.<br/><br/>But, for me, the script is the part that shines, with some of the best repartee between characters I've heard for a long time  and for a very good reason, as you will see. Even in the midst of mayhem and death, there is always time for black humour...<br/><br/>In addition, it the overall theme of this story that stays with me: the question of personal identity and what it means to be me. This is a fundamental issue, as I'm sure you appreciate, and it's one that this story explores with well-constructed logic, robust science (to a point) and mounting horror. If you come away from this story with a shrug of your shoulders, then maybe you've missed crucial news reports, over the last ten years or so, which explore advances and future trends in genetics.<br/><br/>This is a clever story, well-produced and well-acted  and good entertainment to boot.

","""The island"" is surely the highest expression of the genius of Michael Bay. The plot of the movie catapult us in a future world in which men pay for having a own clone, that replaces them when they have a physical problem. But Ewan McGregor (in the movie Lincoln six Echo), counterpart of a such Tom Lincoln, discovers that the world in which he lives with other men is fictitious, and that the island in which the men who live with him are regularly sent is only a farce. Thus, when Jordan Two Delta (the beautiful Scarlett Johansson) is draw out to go to the Island, Lincoln Six takes Echo by the hand and they take flight,followed by the police and the army. The movie is characterized by many spectacular pursuits, essential quality of the films directed by Michael Bay. It is important to underline the great interpretation of Djimon Hounsou( in the movie, Albert Laurent), perhaps more famous for the extraordinary proof in Blood Diamond, who helps the clones to escape from the bunker, rebelling himself to the wicked Merrick ( Sean Bean), director of the society which creates the clones, who dies in a exciting clash against Lincoln Six Echo, at the end of the movie."

But in reality, this movie's story is inspired by Robin Cook's novel ""Chromosome 6"". I am surprised that no one noticed this yet.<br/><br/>This novel is about bonobos who are chimpanzee like creatures but much more similar to human than chimpanzees are. In fact, they are the most genetically similar creatures to humans. Though the movie was not an exact copy of the novel, the idea was strikingly similar. The similarities including the island and secretly carried out operations make it very obvious that the movie is inspired by the novel. I know I am being very vague but if I am more clear, I will give out spoilers.<br/><br/>So, go read the novel and watch the movie since they both are worth it.

","While I may not feel guilt about wanting to see this film perhaps to feed on my lasciviousness for the Danish mammaries and rear end of Scarlett Johansson, as a thinking person I felt apprehensive having to entertain watching a Michael Bay film. A man known to be a confector of action films with so much pomp and zero gravitas.<br/><br/>At trailer's glance you can perhaps learn to slacken off on that notion. The Island has one of sci-fi's best and most thought provoking themes in the area of Bio-ethics. And perhaps how high society and the men in power would take advantage and go as far as disregarding the sacredness of human life.<br/><br/>The film, as many say starts out at a rather slow pace, but that's because - unlike for the stupid man many of us Michael Bay make him out to be, it turns out he gives room for exposition and establishing certain elements. But at 0:45:00 in its duration, the film picks up speed and never lets up, but at the same time never compromises the theme it explores about the powers of a Utopian institution looking for 2 people on the run. In all fairness, yes I do find too much bombast in the way Michael Bay directs, and perhaps the word minimalism doesn't apply to him at all - but if you come up with a decent high concept plot and marry it with that regalia of nonstop action, you get something highly watchable and riveting, such as this film.<br/><br/>It's nice to see Sean Bean play an ""intellectual villain"" rather than a terrorist or someone associated with the mafia. Buscemi is as usual. McGregor? Yes his acting falters in and every time he tries to sell being an ""American"" character - but when he uses his Scottish accent later in the film for reasons you just have to watch this for, the acting improves and any faults heretofore can be overlooked. It's also interesting that they incorporated a real commercial for a Calvin Klein perfume with Scarlett Johansson in it, into the movie.<br/><br/>If you've bumped into Michael Bay's pompous Bad Boys 2, or films with unnecessarily effusive histrionics as Pearl Harbor or Armageddon, that is OK, because The Island has all these in them that can absolve you of some biases and just enjoy the ride, genuinely this time.<br/><br/>7/10"

They have a copy of Caspian Tredwell-Owen's original screenplay; dated January, 2004. (I will refer to it as the ""OS"" from now on.) Its first page is missing. :( The OS is darker, more violent, more adult-oriented, more serious and more thoughtful. If Tredwell-Owen's story had stayed intact, then the released movie most likely would have been ""Rated R for graphic violence, language, nudity, disturbing images, adult content."" WARNING!! Potential spoilers!!! The following is intended only for those who have seen the movie. (If you haven't seen the movie, then, by all means, read the OS first!) One would not believe how many changes were made. The movie seems so diluted in comparison to the OS. The most crucial change of all being why Jordan was created. The story starts out with her being three-months pregnant. Here name here is ""Ester Two-Alpha."" We meet her sponsor; who has a different profession.<br/><br/>Lincoln didn't ask a bunch of questions to Merrick and Jones; as he did in the movie. However, he was able to make connections on a higher level than any of the other clones. Here, Lincoln is an angrier, more bitter character and more temper-prone. He was nine years old at the beginning of the OS. Not three like in the movie.<br/><br/>McCord is in the OS, but he has only one scene; similar to his first scene with Lincoln in the movie. Lincoln met him under different circumstances than in the movie.<br/><br/>Starkweather Two-Delta, on the other hand, is a much more important character. Similar to the movie, he only has a few scenes. But one remembers them. Lincoln and Starkweather have just one scene together (well, technically, two...). It is the turning point of the story.<br/><br/>Jones is similar to how he was in the movie. But he's not the big source of comic relief that he was there. It's established in the OS that Lincoln considers him to be his best friend. Shortly before the escape, Lincoln finds out how much of a friend he is to Jones. He's known here as ""Jones Three-Bravo."" A little more time is spent at The Sanger Institute (as it is known in the OS) before Lincoln and Ester escape. We get to know how things work there. How and why it was created. Further, we get to know its role in the outside world legally, politically, ethically and economically.<br/><br/>Almost the entire story takes place in Arizona. Lincoln's and Ester's sponsors lived in Phoenix and Sedona, respectively. While not spelled out explicitly, it's apparent that Starkweather's sponsor lived in Arizona as well.<br/><br/>The Institute consisted of at least 27 floors. All of the clones lived and worked on Level 20 (""Agnate Containment""). Level 27 reveals an absolutely horrifying stage of the agnate life-cycle not covered in the movie. It involved a branch of physics. This part of the story was difficult to read. (""extending sponsorship"") As in the movie, the clones had identifying cuffs (known as ""ethercuffs"") on their wrists. The movie leaves out that each one also had a ""crosshatched scar"" just above their left eyebrow. At least one person from the outside world called them tattoos.<br/><br/>The clones had ""quotas"" that they couldn't exceed: protein, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, sodium and pleasure While not a quota, there were strict rules regarding proximity. During the meeting with Lincoln and Merrick, Merrick states ""The rules of proximity apply to sexual contact, Lincoln."" The clones were known as ""residents."" TSI employees as ""outsiders."" The Census Officers, or ""Censors,"" wore white; not black like in the movie. Scheer's uniform had black chevrons to mark his seniority over the others. The clones wore shearlings, polo shirts and slacks. Their colors were not stated. But Lincoln is described as wearing a ""white shirt and blue slacks under his shearling"" just before escaping.<br/><br/>The entire Institute was sterile.<br/><br/>Lincoln and Jones had office-type jobs in The Department of Population.<br/><br/>The story appears to begin in the year 2084.<br/><br/>Lincoln's pupils would dilate when he was nervous or sensed danger. Starkweather's, too. (This was a plot hole.) Lincoln didn't like Merrick.<br/><br/>Starkweather woke up AFTER he was cut open! At one point, a censor, unknowingly, hits Ester in her stomach.<br/><br/>When Lincoln and Ester successfully escape The Institute, it is in the middle of the night during a dust storm.<br/><br/>For most of the story, Ester thinks that The Island exists.<br/><br/>At one point, Ester wants to return to The Institute.<br/><br/>Bounty hunters are hired to capture Lincoln and Ester.<br/><br/>Lincoln grows facial hair. Ester becomes increasingly sick.<br/><br/>Since Lincoln Six-Echo is the clone of Thomas Lincoln, and Lincoln here is a different character than he was in the movie, their first meeting together was hostile practically from the start. Tom threatens to call security. Lincoln then threatens him with a knife. Drawing blood from his face.<br/><br/>Lincoln returns alone to The Sanger Institute.<br/><br/>Anyway, one gets the idea that there many, many changes made to Caspian Tredwell-Owen's original script. Overall, it's much better than the diluted story that made its way into the movie.<br/><br/>Yet it shares a similar, significant flaw: after Lincoln discovers what's truly going on, it suddenly turns into an action story. The story's middle act lags and is repetitious. There's some downtime, then an encounter with the bounty hunters, some more downtime, another encounter with the bounty hunters, etc. It has its moments, but's as if Tredwell-Owen abandoned his rich premise for a good long time...then, thankfully, returns to it in its last 30 pages. Where things wrap up in a satisfying conclusion."

"J-bot6","8","0","2","20 April 2007"," A surprising return of solid science fiction storytelling
","Like many people, I took the trailer for The Island at face-value and assumed that this would be another mindless action flick. Michael Bay's name was on it, and he's not the first name that comes to mind when listing directors of cerebral films.<br/><br/>However, after finally viewing this film, I feel that it deserved to do much better at the box offices than it did.<br/><br/>The Island cleverly borrows elements from films like: THX-1138, Coma, Future World, Blade Runner, and Logan's Run. Although it does have its fair share of action sequences, it still manages to slip in messages about greed, morality, the possible future of cloning, and what people will do in order to survive. <br/><br/>The treatment was exceptional, and it represents one of the few films that actually manages to modernize the classic 60s and 70s science-fiction story-telling style, without throwing away the substance or feel of that time-period's most notable sci-fi films. My only qualm with this picture is with the over-use of action scenes. There are a couple of sequences that are so over-the-top as to diminish the level of believability for this film. Cutting back on these scenes would have helped the movie's dramatic elements as well. <br/><br/>Having seen The Island, I have no choice but to cast my vote for Michael Bay and the team that created this film to be the ones to make a motion picture version of The Bionic Man (6 Billion Dollar Man -- factoring in inflation?), if such a movie is ever slated for production.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, and watch The Island.

","OK, so this isn't meant to be a very cerebral picture. Its an action movie.<br/><br/>With that having been said, I found it to be a lot of fun, as long as you can suspend your disbelief in a big way. A very big way.<br/><br/>I can list lots of ways that this movie is beyond believable. For one thing, Jordan and Lincoln were chased through Los Angeles by paramilitary commandos who shot up half the city and killed two cops, with barely any notice from law enforcement. Or that if society possessed the technology to clone entire functional humans, it would easily have the ability to simply grow individual cloned organs which would be far cheaper and less complex for all kinds of reasons. Or that apparently, 50 years from now everyone drives a 2006 Chrysler 300.<br/><br/>But the one fatal flaw in this storyline has to do with the entire premise that all of these thousands of clones live in a massive secret facility together. And that flaw is the one that plagues all conspiracy theories. Quite simply, it would be totally impossible to keep a secret that big. Literally hundreds of scientists, engineers, support staff and janitors work at the facility. All of them would have to keep it quiet. There are no disgruntled former staff? Even the low-paid janitors keep the secret, despite the potential for a huge payout by talking to a tabloid or news program? Nobody had a crisis of conscience? Everyone keeps it quiet? Not possible.<br/><br/>But... it was still a fun movie to watch. The cinematography was really good, the action sequences were very engaging and the acting was well above average. Overall, it was engaging, and I enjoyed it."
"ElmStreetsLastBrat","7","0","2","7 March 2007"," Intriguing plot with some exciting action sequences = GOOD MOVIE!
","""The Island"" is a very good movie. It had some breathtaking action sequences and the intriguing plot was pretty easy to follow. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsson were perfectly cast in this film, although they do seem like a mismatched couple. I love all the futuristic architecture and technology in the film. Very stylish and innovative. Sean Bean was the ultimate villain. (would you consider him a ""villain"" in this movie?) He just has the perfect facial expressions. The scenes of Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta trying to escape from the facility and all the mercenaries trying to kill them were adrenaline pumping and you just hoped that they would get away. The plot was very interesting. It was definitely different. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsson play two clones of real people who are sick and need organ transplants. So this facility where the clones were born and live their lives keep them alive for a while and then when they ""win the lottery"" they get to go to the ""Island"", but there is no island. The creators of these clones tell them that they're going to the island so they can kill them and use their organs for the people that they're actual clones of. And when these clones are born, there are images, such as grandma baking cookies and them riding their bicycles, that are embedded into their brain and that's what they think are parts of their childhood. But of course they had no childhood because they're clones! And in another interesting plot twist: the real people actually know that they have a clone because they pay for them! They pay for the clones to be created. So I found that quite interesting. But I loved the action in this film. From the car crashes to Lincoln and Jordan holding on to a company logo on the side of a tall building and it crashing to the ground to all the gunfire being crossed. It was breath taking! It kept you intrigued and made you anxious to see what would happen next. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I definitely recommend it to anyone who's a fan of science fiction or just action in general. This is an exhilarating film and I think it is a very well made movie. Definitely a must see for any action fan! Thanks for reading my review!"
"view_and_review","7","0","2","23 February 2007"," Another perspective on cloning
","Here we go with another clone story. This time the clones are around for spare parts, a direct reflection of the issue of stem cell research. This movie did separate itself from similar movies such as ""The Sixth Day"" and ""Godsend"", in that these clones were isolated and kept away from society and completely unknown to anyone. But what do you do if one of these precious clones happens to escape captivity? There was some excitement and some suspense in the movie, but the real interest lied in the story behind the clones. How did they come about? Why were they made? Why were they being held in captivity? And why did one clone happen to remember things that he had no business remembering? <br/><br/>The fact that the movie was about clones was kept hidden for some time, which also helped the story. You were lead to believe that these people in this enclosed, yet state of the art facility, were there to escape the contaminated outside world. Every so often there would be a lottery and the lucky one(s) that were chosen got to go to the ""Island""; a beautiful tropical place free of contamination... or so they thought.<br/><br/>""The Island"" was yet another view point of the issue of cloning. Fortunately they distinguished this movie from other movies regarding cloning so as to not be a mimic. But one thing is constant between every well known movie about cloning; things don't turn out good."
"pantera1","7","0","1","6 February 2007"," No man is an island. Or is he?
","Ewan Mcgregor's come a long way since his breakthrough role in TRAINSPOTTING (8/10). And boy has he had fun doing it. He's played dancers, and sung (successfully), played soldiers and star warriors, cartoons and crooks. In fact the only commonality is that they are all so different. But the one thread that runs through is that he's just so goddamn likable! In this film he plays a human clone,Lincoln Six Echo, who comes to have a sense of awareness; an awakening sensibility. He starts having bad dreams that have no sense of continuity with his own memories. And the story is of his relationship with Jordan (played surprisingly well by Scarlett Johannsenn) and his own growing awareness.<br/><br/>It's pretty easy to tell the good guys from the bad ones; going back to Tom Mix cowboy films, the good guys are in white and the bad guys in black. Actually some of the good guys eventually do dress in black so lets rephrase that; the guys in white are the non sentient and the ones in black have self awareness.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of big action films of now, the acting is of an exceptional calibre and talent list. Whereas the talent in most action films tends to be of porn star calibre, here we have Sean Bean in a major role as well as the cheese monkey Steve Buscemi in a minor but essential one.<br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou plays the seeker who has to go out and hunt down. While this role is a relatively ordinary one, he brings gravitas and style to it. He's an extraordinary actor who has been nominated ( and is my pick) for a best supporting actor Oscar after being cruelly ignored in the astounding AMISTAD (9/10).<br/><br/>Michael Bay is the bomb. Literally. He lives for the big explosion/ chase scenes. This is the guy who put the arms in Armageddon. (6/10) and the Bad in BAD BOYS. With romantic interplay, you can feel it's very much the second directors job to do that while he does the more exciting stuff.<br/><br/>The film has echos of GATTACA (10/10) of a controlled future, where society is controlled and the freedom of choice is taken away for the greater good. It works as an action film and asks a couple of interesting ethical questions along the way. Happily you won't be baying for the directors head after this one."

","Somewhere between Minority Report and Logan's Run/Soylent Green lives Michael Bay's, 'The Island'. If you understand going into this movie that it is a 'Michael Bay' film then you won't be too disappointed in how much it sucks, but if you're not familiar with Mr.Bay's work and are expecting a slick/smart look into a modern sci-fi thriller, you'll really be angry.<br/><br/>On the positive side of things, there's plenty of eye candy, whether your preference is for the bursting out and beautiful Scarlett Johansson or the always steady yet geeky macho leanings of Ewan McGregor, the viewer is never more than 45 seconds away from their allotted camera time. If you like sleek angled, yet threadbare movie sets...then all is still fine in your universe of the future.<br/><br/>But the film goes terribly, terribly wrong when it bypasses logical thought for the sake of its many horrible action sequences. Every action scene is filmed in an extreme close up with the camera shaking so as not to let the viewer really see how lame the scene would actually look if the camera were not shaking.<br/><br/>I could throw in many scenes where there is a definite leap in logic, but really, take my word for it, there's too many to recount.<br/><br/>But to give proper credit, the eye candy is what makes this film even somewhat entertaining. Ewan and Scarlett really do seem to be trying to earn their money, they will win you back to the film from time to time. The culprit of stupid here is in its director...he has no eye for subtlety, nor does he have a gift as a story teller.<br/><br/>The film also features the always sweating Djimon Hounsou as a renegade navy seal or some such thing. He's a tough guy who is hired to capture Ewan and Scarlett once they break out of their virtual 'womb'. The film also has terminal second banana Sean Bean as the bad guy who wears glasses and describes himself as a doctor to appear smart.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I completely bought into what the Island is supposed to represent or whether or not this story is an open forum for stem cell research or cloning...I just don't know. What I do know is that there is a shell of potential here for a better movie than the one that was made...a clone, if you will."

","As a collector of Ewan McGregor's work, it seemed inevitable that one day i would get round to watching ""The Island"". However, i put it off for as long as possible because, having seen the disastrous write-ups, i didn't want to lower my opinion of one of our finest Scottish actors. I must say though, i was pleasantly surprised and may even go as far to say, i regret not watching this film earlier. It is, admittedly, a little slow starting, but this build up is essential in paving the way for the rest of the story. The high speed chases are brilliantly done and the love scenes delicately handled so they are tasteful. The characters are well rounded and Ewan McGregor playing 2 roles simultaneously is not only an amazing work of the blue screen but a fine performance displayed by the man himself. Scarlet Johassen also puts in an amazing performance as the lead lady. The cinematography of the final scenes is perhaps the best visuality of the 2 hours 10 minutes, but it's well worth the wait. An absolutely brilliant watch - ignore whatever you may have already read about this film! The only criticism i will make is with regards to Ewan's American accent. Stick to Scottish or English :)"

","When you compare the island with the book Brave New World written by Aldous Huxly, you see big similarities but also big differences. The idea in both stories are when people kept stupid, they'll like the world. You cant dream of something that doesn't exist in your mind. The big difference is that the world in Brave New world was created with good will,keep the people happy, healthy, and satisfied. In the Island on contrary the people in the society are reproductions of human beings held for the profit. Nice to see is that in both stories one person starts thinking and questioning the society that he lives in (or comes in) The movie is a very good movie except the action parts which fell under the category Arnold Schwarzenegger movie."

","From the minute I started watching the film ""The Island"" it fascinated me. The director Michael Bay did a good job by getting the attention of the viewers. <br/><br/>The story takes place in the nearby future and starts in a huge building, apparently under the ground. You get sucked into the life of Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) who turns out to be a clone. Lincoln Six Echo lives in the community under the ground with thousands of clones more. All the clones think they have survived a contamination because the institution wants them to believe that. This isn't the truth. In fact, the clones are the insurance policy of the rich people who, when they get ill, get the body parts of their clones and will survive while their clones die. The clones, or agnates as they are called in the movie, like the centre they live in but they want one thing more: to win the lottery. If you win the lottery you can go to the Island. ""You're special. You have a very special purpose in life. You've been chosen. The Island awaits you""<br/><br/>Lincoln Six Echo finds out the truth about the centre and he escapes with another clone, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson). There is where the action begin. I'm a huge fan of action movies but this film is too much. I like it when the action stays real but what happens in this film is too surreal. Falling of a huge skyscraper and being shot at, it makes me wonder, why won't they die? Well of course, they are the good guys and can't die! That's a bit to corny. <br/><br/>In this film you can see quite a lot of similarities with the novel ""Brave New World"" from Aldous Huxley. Both of the stories take place in the nearby future. In Brave New World the characters are 'normal' people and not clones but the principle is the same. Both of the groups are being indoctrinated by hypnopaedia what affects their minds. Another similarity is the way the community works. You can recognize a person by their name, each group has their own name like Echo, Delta, Epsilon etc.<br/><br/>I really liked the movie although it's a bit too surreal for me. The main thought about the future and what we can do in the medical sector is good thing to think about. The director did a good job because I'm still thinking of what will happen in the nearby future, because we are going to live in it"

","""The Island"" is a fake paradise. The island tells the story of an underground facility where clones are harvested and eventually destroyed. Each clone within the compound is a copy of a wealthy person living in the outside world. When that person or ""sponsor"" is debilitated in any physical way, it is replaced using their clones. Once two clones Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan Mcgreggor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) discover what's really going on, they escape in order to find their sponsors, find out what's really going on, and prevent the deaths of thousands of clones. The Island is a combination of science fiction and action-thriller. <br/><br/>The movie looks like two movies joined at the hip, the first half tells the story of Lincoln Six-Echo, Ewan McGregor, and his disillusionment with his life and his budding curiosity, which leads him to escape his dwelling with Jordan Two-Delta, Scarlett Johansson (Berardinelli). They have been told that there was a mass contamination in the ""outside former"" world and they were some of the lucky survivors (Man). Their future hangs on a lottery where winners get to re-locate to ""The Island"", the one remaining pathogen free zone on earth (Bay). When Jordan wins the lottery, Lincoln impulsively snatches her, and they escape underground eventually finding ""the real world""."

","After watching the movie The Island I definitely can say that it was a spectacular movie. It contained a lot of action and the idea of the plot is nice. But was it all that great? I'm going to have to say no, because the longer I think about the movie, the worse is gets. <br/><br/>The movie starts great: a society of clones, or in the movie called agnates, live together in huge hidden buildings, thinking that they are the only survivors of a world-wide contamination. The truth is that they actually are clones of rich people who paid a lot of money to get a clone of themselves, so that they would have a insurance policy when they need for example a liver or a heart. When the sponsors of the clones need a body part, there will be lottery and the 'chosen ones' will go to the Island, the only place left on earth that is not contaminated. Of course, this isn't true, there is no Island. What really will happen to them, is that they'll have surgery, get ridden of the needed body parts and after that, die. <br/><br/>The two main characters, Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta, find out the truth about the Island and escape from their 'prison'. As soon as they come into the 'real' world, the action begins. After a few minutes I already got fed up with it. OK, the special effects were great! But it was all just too surreal, nobody would survive things like jumping of a huge sky liner.. The action scene with train wheels was also very nerve breaking, because where the hell do people need train wheels for when they have trains floating on magnetic force? <br/><br/>The story, the plot, of The Island is well thought. Cloning people is and will be a fascinating subject but the story of the movie isn't that original. Some parts of the movie are very similar to the book Brave New World, a novel by Aldous Huxley. First, the 'production' of the clones looks very much like the production of the Bokanovski Groups. They are created in test tubes and brought up by hypnopaedia, also known as sleep teaching. Also the buildings the clones live in look very much like the description of the buildings in Brave New World and everybody has to do their own chore, for instant in the movie they have to inject pipes with some liquid. This looks a bit like the jobs that the Epsilons have to do in the novel, they have to do all kind of 'stupid' chores, everybody can do it. The clones are a little bit treated as Epsilons. Last but not least, it takes place the future. The technology is very important and everybody is wearing a white uniform, something that is similar to the uniforms of the alphas, betas etc. in Huxley's novel. <br/><br/>So if you like good movies with deep thoughts, I would not watch this movie. The begin promises a lot but the end is very disappointing. A shame, I would say, but still very good material for a lazy afternoon when you are in the mood for a 'thrilling' action movie and you don't care about reality."

","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>I was strongly reminded of ""Logan's Run"" when watching this, only this wasn't nearly as good. The Island certainly isn't dull at all but on the whole this was not for me. It's the kind of movie I could see why somebody else would adore but just wasn't my type of thing.<br/><br/>The premise was creepy and the movie absorbing but the movie was so bizarre it was very difficult to enjoy. The futuristic atmosphere gets to you after awhile and because of the subject matter, it is rather difficult to watch. There was also to much violence. As for the action scenes they jump out at you and sure were larger then life but I also felt the movie should not necessarily have been so geared toward the action. For what they were they are well done but I would have preferred that there weren't so much action because that took away from the storyline and took the movie to being almost an action flick rather then a creepy drama/science fiction.<br/><br/>Although The Island does keep one watching I alternated between being fascinated by the movie and finding elements of it almost annoying. I am glad this had a happy ending as I admit I did not think it would, but I did find the ending to abrupt and rather unbelievable. I would have liked more explained and it just seemed kind of flat after the whole big buildup. I would have liked to see a more powerful ending like Johanson and Mcgreggor actually getting on the news with this story. I just felt it ended to abruptly.<br/><br/>One strong point though, is that it was extremely well acted however and Mcgregor in particular was excellent. I could see where this could have been a masterpiece but I didn't think it really was. The only way I could see watching it again, is perhaps, to pick up on things not picked up in the first viewing. (It seems like the type of movie one should see more then once.) But being that I did not find this very enjoyable, I'm not sure I would see it again. In closing, I wouldn't really recommend it though I didn't think it was absolutely dreadful either. (I know people who absolutely hate this.) I wouldn't say I hated it because as mentioned, it's tremendously absorbing, and very well acted. But there's to much violence, to much action, to much not explained, and to little slow quiet drama. I'd rate this around average."

It's anti-humanism, & goes right back to the fact that there are always people trying to play God--much to their detriment. Someone in Hollywood actually made this film? We need some more movies like this! That aside, it's a very well-made film. None of the action seems superfluous. That has a tendency to happen many times w/ chase scenes in films (""was that explosion completely necessary?""), but not in this case.

","The Island is a good movie, It's a group of people in a Utopian world who are told that their was a large contamination on earth that killed off life. Every once in a while, people are chosen to go to the island, the last known uncontaminated place. A member of the society (Ewan McGregor) discovers the truth behind this situation and seeks to exploit with help of his best friend (Scarlett Johannson). The script is pretty good. It has a great concept and funny dialog every once in a while.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor gives a poor performance. His character is supposed to be child-like and he does that well, but his performance lacks small details that make it realistic. He also plays an actor in the film who has a key role in story. He does this with a bad Scottish accent. Scarlett Johannson gives a very good performance. She has limited dialog, but she plays her character quite well, and is brilliant on one particular scene. Djimon Hounsou gives a good performance as a bounty-hunter who has a change of the heart. Steve Buscemi gives a good comedic performance.<br/><br/>It's a Michael Bay film so you the action and cinematography are top-notch.<br/><br/>OVERALL: Other than the Ewan McGregor's performance, The Island is a highly entertaining."

","Set in the year 2019, ""The Island"" provides yet another dystopian view of the future, one in which mankind must grapple with ethical questions specifically related to how he will use the technology he's created. In this case, it has to do with human cloning and how far we are willing to go to prolong our own hitherto limited life spans - and at whose expense.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two young people living in a hermetically sealed world after some sort of global ""contamination"" has ostensibly rendered the majority of the outside world uninhabitable (all except an island paradise that the people living here can travel to if they are lucky enough to win it as a prize in a lottery). Recently, however, McGregor has come to question many of the ""truths"" he sees in the world around him, wondering if there isn't some other, more sinister and diabolical explanation than the one he has been given by the powers-that-be, who monitor and run virtually every aspect of not only his life but the lives of those living and working alongside him.<br/><br/>Watching ""The Island"" is a bit like riding on a train that runs along smoothly for the most part, yet keeps jumping off the tracks at frequent and inconvenient intervals. You eventually arrive at where you're going, but there's an awful lot of frustration and delay in getting there. When the screenplay concentrates on the moral and ethical implications raised by its brave-new-world premise, the film is often incisive, thoughtful and compelling. Yet, as this is a Michael Bay film, the audience can't be allowed to become TOO thoughtful, so the filmmaker loads on one lame action scene after another to the point where the issues become buried under all the pyrotechnics. Every so often those issues manage to rise again to the surface only to be pushed back down by seemingly endless high speed car chases, earsplitting explosions and shattering glass that cascades in slow motion streams onto hero, villain and innocent bystander alike.<br/><br/>McGregor and Johansson aren't given much to do in the way of acting in the film, but Steve Buscemi manages to create something of a genuine character in the few scenes he is given. The art direction and set design are highly impressive and the over-the-top action scenes are admittedly well mounted and executed, even though they wind up weakening the movie. Yet, just when you're about to give up on it, ""The Island"" manages to climb back onto the rails and get you interested in it again. That's actually something of a step forward for Mr. Bay."

","In the Island Ewan McGregor(Shallow Grave) plays Lincoln 6 echo and does a great job like always. Scarlett Johansson (In good company, Home alone 3) plays Lincoln's ""friend"". There are a lot of jokes throughout this movie that really keep your interest and make the movie pretty good. Steve Buscemi(Fargo) plays McCord which is the heart of the film really, he knows what's going on and tries to make it better through Lincoln.<br/><br/>This movie is a bit long for the story, it was a forty-five minute movie told in over two hours. The action scenes seem forced and most of them are too long. I did hope Michael Clarke Duncan would have a bigger part, but I did enjoy the short time he was on screen. The real comedy comes from Ethan Phillips and Brian Stepanek That play two of Lincoln's friends. <br/><br/>In my opinion this movie is mediocre and it's just a fun movie to watch. Just don't get use to the first forty minutes, cause the plot takes a left turn and your left wondering ""What just happened?""."

"neal-67","6","0","1","23 April 2006"," Sci-Fi elements sacrificed for action
","Un-original yet still a perfect Sci-Fi story with great cast and the potential of a 7 - 7.5 rating. It gets a 6 because of typical Michael Bay.<br/><br/>The downfall of this film is that Sci-fi and plot depth is sacrificed for action. Don't get me wrong I love action films BUT this film was trying to be more than this and had so much potential to do so. This film is good, yet I also found it irritating because of the missed potential. What it seemed to be aiming for was missed because of these short cuts. You can't sacrifice sci-fi elements like this. Before i list some i feel the big question i must ask first, due to it playing the key part to the ""plot"", is why do the clones have a consciousness just to have their organs harvested? - details would of been nice.<br/><br/>1) Ewan's character sneaks out of his room when everyone is asleep, and escapes into the restricted area to release a bug and follow where it goes: This was rather easy to do. Are there no security staff monitoring sensors or cameras? Why not put a scene in there showing a security staff member not paying attention to the security cameras?.<br/><br/>2) The car chase scene where iron train wheels are released from an ""automated truck!?!?"" causing devastation on the road: This scene is there solely for action (and ripped from Michael bays shocker Bad Boys 2). This truck that is carrying the wheels you just assume is automated. Does the technology driving it not allow for accidents on the road? If there was an accident, as happens here, would a system not tell the truck to stop, instead of allowing it to continue losing its payload causing devastation?. I'm not saying get rid of this scene, its great action - simply add detail. Oh....and just get rid of the flying bikes bit - amazing how isolated 3 year old clone Lincoln can operate the bike so well.<br/><br/>3) The scene with Ewan's character (Lincoln) and Scarlett's (Jordan) on the buildings logo. Badly shot and I don't see them surviving it, do you? The construction guy who pulled them out of the wreckage  why did he have to have them AWFUL comedy lines. This sort of dialogue was fine once thank you from the receptionist in a previous scene.<br/><br/>4) Why did the original Lincoln let the clone Lincoln drive the car? Absurd! Why did he even leave the house with his clone? Why not hold him hostage at the house with his gun until the authorities arrived?. Was an excuse to put a flash looking car in the film.<br/><br/>5) Why did Djimon Hounsou's character shoot one of the Lincolns based on him having the bracelet? Why not take them both back to the bunker to Sean beans character? He is a grounded, professional character with feelings and respect for life(as we see at the end). Shooting the one Lincoln is out of character.<br/><br/>6) The agency discovers that the real Lincoln is the dead body and not that of the clone, because the bracelet is on the wrong arm. Hmmm very thin  would there be no other tests done before confirming this.<br/><br/>7) WOW - Product placement is plentiful in this film and gets seriously irritating.<br/><br/>Scarlett wasn't really used. Ewan McGregor, Sean Bean and Djimon Hounsou were great and it's always nice to see Steve Buscemi. Not original BUT still a great story and plot with some impressive visuals (and bad), great sci-fi detail (and awful that sticks out like a sore thumb) and a good score, especially with the end scene. Mr Bay just please stop blowing everything up and putting pointless scenes in your films."
"baconballs1969","8","0","1","11 March 2006"," Scary Stuff
","I thought this film was excellent but it also scared me.<br/><br/>What if this kind of thing became reality? The way the world and technology is progressing I feel that this kind of thing could soon become a reality.<br/><br/>The thought that the rich and famous could take out ""insurance policies"" in the form of clones of themselves to use in the future if their own organs need replacing or they need skin-grafts or bone marrow, etc is very, very frightening to me.<br/><br/>It is yet just another example of how man feels that he can play God. It's so very, very wrong. I thought long and hard about the moral implications of all of this but it did say in the film that the clones didn't have any souls and when they expired they just died with no chance of the glorious resurrection.<br/><br/>I hope that this kind of stuff never becomes possible, our Lord God would, I expect, be absolutely furious and sickened if this type of thing became a reality. Perhaps this type of ""progress"" would be enough for God to call time on the mankind and the whole Earth and trigger Armageddon.<br/><br/>All in all though, I know at the moment that this is still only fiction. For the time being at least.<br/><br/>That said, I really did enjoy the film and thought the action scenes and chases were all excellent.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone but for all the religious out there amongst you it certainly does provide food for thought.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have is that the film is somewhat over-long with a run time of just over 2 hours. As a rule I generally become rather irritable after 100 minutes but this film merited the wait to see the conclusion."

"owlglass","10","0","2","29 January 2006"," One of the three best movies of 2005
","The Island, together with King Kong (my #1) and Serenity (struggling with The Island for #2 place), are my favorite movies of 2005. Each has left a profound impression on me. <br/><br/>I'm not going to summarize the plot, since it's been discussed at length before. Instead, here are some points that need to me mentioned in order to do the film justice.<br/><br/>The Island, if one feels bound to refer to other movies, is basically Logan's Run meeting Bladerunner. It asks some of the same questions; most significantly one of profound philosophical import: how do you define a 'human being'? <br/><br/>Sidebar: The often-mentioned Gattaca, on the other handand I'm pointing this out this for the benefit of those reviewers still struggling with comprehension of the fundamental difference between the moviesasked if the value of human beings depends on their genetic makeup; just like one might ask if a handicapped person is of equal value as one who isn't.<br/><br/>Should a cloned ('replicated', 'copied') but conscious human being be accorded the same rights as one created and brought into this world in a more conventional manner? What is consciousness anyway? How do you detect it? <br/><br/>How far will human beings go to preserve their lives? (There's a truly disturbing part in Michael Bay's commentary on the DVD regarding this. Truth apparently is even more sickening than the occasionally quite troubling fiction of The Island.) <br/><br/>The Island deals with these issues in all seriousness; but not in a pretentious or 'arty' manner, or with the ponderous gravitas that might have eventuated in the hands of a 'serious' director. It also answers them; at least as much as it is possiblefor, after all, who _can_ say what 'consciousness' actually 'is'? We all _know_ what it is, but try to _define_ it and you're instantly stepping on philosophical quicksand. <br/><br/>All this is accomplished in the context for an 'action' movie, and one by Michael Bay at that. That instantly gets a lot of folks' hackles up; for Michael Bay can't possibly make a movie with depth, right? Well, think again, for this one is. An object lesson, if we need one, to teach us that not every action film has to be a one-dimensional Tom Cruise or Will Smith vehicle. The Island strikes an exquisite balance between the relief provided by humor and the physical- ness of some very well done action, moments of reflection, and a multi-layered plot with lots of hidden meanings and question marks, as well as a satisfying denouement. <br/><br/>Above alland unlike Gattaca, which was a very 'self centered' movie; with the protagonist really only interested in himself and his own plans and tribulationsThe Island ultimately went beyond that and toward displaying a sense of social responsibility. One of the most touching moments of the movie occurs when Lincoln and Jordan spin dreams of what they would like to do, and how they could just go far away and live like 'real people'; and then he says ""...but after..."", meaning after having tried to help ""all those people we left behind"", who are about to be destroyed (well, 'killed' or 'murdered' would be more appropriate) as their makers try to 'start over' a new generation of clones with less troublesome predilections. <br/><br/>The decision to risk their future for the sake of their fellow clones, is the ultimate proof of Lincoln's and Jordan's humanity; and in the process they help to redeem the one who has hunted them relentlessly, and who rediscovers his own humanity as a result of his interaction with them.<br/><br/>One issue has raised justifiable questions: how did the clones 'know' all these things they knew? Or, how did not just they, but apparently another whole lot, become infected with apparently spontaneously-generated memories of their 'sponsors', that is the people they were cloned from?<br/><br/>One possible answer is that memories are encoded in the DNA of a personbut that doesn't make much sense. There is nothing to suggest in current scientific research that this is either possible or that it happens. Another theoryand this is where 'speculation' enters the fray is that (slightly extending theories such as those developed by the likes of Rupert Sheldrake or Roger Penrose) people with identical genetic makeup have a 'connection' that goes beyond mere genetics; that they are 'linked' (telepathically?) in some way. Maybe that's how their 'memories' seemed to have 'grown' spontaneously over the lifetimes of the clones. Maybe that's also why, in some ways, the clonesand especially Lincolnseemed to have acquired certain characteristics of their 'sponsors'.<br/><br/>I don't know and neither did the God-potentate Merrick, who was highly and unpleasantly surprised by this turn of events; though for a few moments he appeared to be genuinely stimulated by the notion, until he realized that it was interfering with his carefully laid-out plans and DOD funding. He never found the explanation, before he died at the hands of one of his creations. <br/><br/>So, is there a suggestion here that there's more to life and humanity and the mind and every- damn-thing than is currently accepted by science? I know some people aren't comfortable with that notion, and, being an atheist myself, I'm not bringing God into this eitherbut is the notion that we haven't figured out the fundamentals of 'human nature' really so preposterous? Is it unreasonable for a movie, and especially one so unashamedly 'entertainment', to suggest that maybe we don't know everything, and that our ignorance, combined with the delusions of omniscience in some, is likely to come and bite us in the butt? <br/><br/>I think not. This theme, by the way, is also picked up in that other cinematographic gem, Serenity, though from a slightly different angle.<br/><br/>Till Noever owlglass.com Author: Keaen, Continuity Slip, Seladiënna"

"Denver53","6","0","1","25 January 2006"," Great start, then takes the wrong path
","After a fascinating first 30 minutes or so, The Island goes big when it should have stayed spare.<br/><br/>Like Gattaca (one of my favorite movies), The Island presents us with a future that asks us questions about where we are headed in our real present. And it asks us to decide whether this future is what we want. Unlike Gattaca, which kept the chases to a minimum and instead capitalized on great performances by its actors as their actions gave us new insights, The Island becomes what seems like one, big chase scene broken into several different parts (depending on the vehicle being chased).<br/><br/>We figure out in the first quarter of the movie what is really going on here. That first quarter is very effective at intriguing and disgusting the viewer. Unfortunately, because we know so quickly what is happening, that leaves the next 90 minutes to essentially follow two characters as they are thrust into new and dangerous situations and then escape them. During all of this time, the viewer wonders when the movie will return to some of the central questions raised during its first 45 minutes. It eventually does, sort of.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, if a bit disconcerting when characters who appear to be at least 30 years of age and some close to 40 seem to be at best young teenagers in the way they struggle to express questions about their environment and future. Even so, the main characters seem to learn about reality a bit too quickly. They act when they should still be asking questions, preferably when they had time to do so and weren't simply running.<br/><br/>And the movie succumbs to cheap impulses when it allows the security people at ""The Institute,"" who know what is going on there, to laugh or taunt their victims. It would have been far creepier if those security forces had remained professional at all times, because that would have indicated these people were sincere in their support and not just paid lackeys.<br/><br/>If The Island had cut out 20 minutes of chases and replaced it with more discussion among the main characters about who they are and whether that is a feasible answer, it would have been better. As it was, we gave The Island a 6."

"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","0","1","24 December 2005"," Bay's Island Not Worth Visiting
","There are certain things in this world one can count on: the sun will rise in the East, the swallows will return to Capistrano, Old Faithful will erupt right on schedule, and Michael Bay will ruin any piece of material he gets his hands on, ruin it spectacularly. The latest proof of this iron-clad certainty is The Island, a film whose scenario might have been the stuff of which cautionary sci-fi magic is made, but we'll never know now because Bay has bled every last drop of intelligence out of it, yielding up yet another loud, obnoxious, idiotic disaster.<br/><br/>Could we have expected anything else? Perhaps our hopes are raised for a moment in the early passages of the film: we watch as plucky Ewan McGregor begins to realize something is wrong with his reality, one where identically-clad, creepily cheerful people wander the antiseptic confines of earth's last living colony, a massive complex sealed off from the mysteriously contaminated outside world. Perhaps, for a moment, we think the movie will be serious about rendering this illusory paradise, one where people are protected from harm at the price of their souls; but then we realize that we should've known better, that with Michael Bay at the helm the film's tone will be naggingly silly, that any potential within the scenario, the characters, will be frittered away in the name of cheap thrills, low-brow humor and dorky romance.<br/><br/>McGregor quickly discovers the truth about the complex: that the tenants are not in fact survivors of a plague, but clones engineered to provide body parts for their ""sponsors,"" rich people living in the ""real world"", who have been conned by the evil corporation (always has to be one of those) into believing their ""insurance policies"" are merely vegetables being kept in cold-storage, their organs waiting to be ""harvested."" This revelation naturally doesn't sit well with McGregor who, along with equally plucky companion Scarlett Johansson, flees the underground facility for 2019 Los Angeles, only to be pursued by a shady operative played by Djimon ""Don't Call Me Agent Girard; Okay Call Me Agent Girard"" Hounsou.<br/><br/>Someone obviously had a clever idea for a sci-fi plot somewhere along the way; and they may even have been smart enough to see the wit in this idea, the allegorical potential of it (Are we not all clones awaiting our turn in paradise? Well are we not?). And Michael Bay may even be smart enough to have seen the same potential - except that Mr. Bay is obviously not capable of the subtlety that would've been required to make something smart and funny and thematically relevant out of the story, and goes the obvious route instead, expending his energies working out car-chases. The problem with Bay, beyond the fact that he's clearly a knucklehead, is that his styling is really not cool anymore, that his movie just seems so damn 1998. Bay is the only person in the world who thinks his trademark low-angle shots of men with guns against soaring skyscrapers are still neat-looking (at least he abstains from the old ""slow-motion-shot-of-someone-walking-away-from-an-exploding-vehicle"" bit). The '80s/early '90s action films of Ridley Scott, particularly Black Rain, have this datedness to them that is amusing by itself (Michael Douglas's mullet in Black Rain gets belly-laughs), but Bay's datedness has not yet gotten to the point where it's funny. His movie gives off the vibe of something made by someone who hasn't been paying attention to what's been happening action-movie-wise in the last few years, who thinks audiences are still going ga-ga over the same stuff they did back when The Rock was the last word in shoot-em-ups. Didn't Bay see The Matrix? Lord of the Rings? Even Spielberg rolls with the punches, but Bay seems trapped in some time-warp where it will always be the late '90s, and he will always be the action maven of the moment.<br/><br/>Bay strands his movie and his actors in shallow water, leaving them to fend for themselves. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are given the thankless task of playing a pair of dopey over-grown children (the clones are kept at the mental level of grade-school kids, presumably to keep them from rebelling; the guys who run the complex must not know very many grade-school kids) who are just learning about things like kissing and flying motorcycles; the actors are forced to react with wide-eyed wonderment at everything, and their efforts are less than convincing. McGregor seems neutered, and Johansson, despite looking ravishing in every shot, comes across shrill and unengaged. Such half-assed performances result from having a director who cares nothing about nuance, who is unable to mine a scenario for any nuggets of human interest, or wit, or philosophy. There's something of interest hiding inside The Island, a movie about how human beings are more than the sum of their parts, but the man who made it is simply not able to see it, or if he is, doesn't know how to bring it to life on the screen."
"booju","10","0","2","18 December 2005"," Excellent Movie!
","Frankly, this was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen.<br/><br/>I wonder if it was fashioned after THX 1138 with Robert Duvall in 1971. It had a similar plot whose underground populace was also imprisoned in a sterile environment employed in useless, mundane chores, but supervised by robotic guards. It ended after an underground chase, when main character reached the surface.<br/><br/>I was intrigued how the 2005's version went further by having the main character interface with the real world; or rather, the world as conceived in the future. The 2005 version made its 1971 counterpart make sense.<br/><br/>The chases in the Island were way cool. I loved the high tech transit systems. The choice of actors couldn't be better. The occasional touch of humor was excellently placed.<br/><br/>This movie has been wonderful for the imagination, based on my captivation with the 1971 version. I'm fashioning the 2005 version as an earlier rendering of THX 1138.<br/><br/>I give full credits for the choice of plot, characters, settings, music, and special effects.

The effects are really good; there is vividness, reality and, especially in the action scenes you feel you are a part of the movie (certain camera effects).

They are not good, they are great, they make you believe.<br/><br/>Secondly, the story: it's all about a philosophy of life. You know when you're little and try to imagine what life would be if (...)? Well, that's what The Island is all about: some sort of theory of life.<br/><br/>Finally, the actions: fully loaded would be the two words to describe this movie. The action is everywhere, all the time, even when you don't expect it.<br/><br/>The only thing I personally disliked about The Island is the time... After 2 hours, it could be the end, but it's not... Maybe the whole thing could have been cut up a bit."

","OK put your ""Roger Moore 007"" ""reality in chase scenes"" goggles on. Got them on snug? Good. You are now ready to view this movie. This is not a science fiction movie because there is no science involved here. There is a cute blonde with very full lips though. This is an action movie pretending to tell a sci fi tale. If you don't know what the difference is you have never read a book and most likely swing from low trees and potentially lack the ability to create fire. <br/><br/>For the rest of us, we need to approach this movie with the understanding that it will degenerate into a high speed chase with the most implausible twists of fate conceivable to man. Trust me, the concept of harvesting clones is far more realistic than some of the stunts that occur during the chase scenes. That being said- it's still kind of FUN to watch the over the top action with the requisite cliff hanger scene of the two leads, one saving the other from certain death.. *sigh*. <br/><br/>Anyways- as long as you are ready for the shift in gears to high action chase movie when it happens, it won't make your stomach upset and you may even like it. I cannot however forgive the very ending of this movie. When you see/hear it simply say to yourself aloud.. what the hell is this? The Lion King? It will make sense when you see the end.

"MauriceKA","9","0","1","28 October 2005"," The scariest movie I have seen in the last 20 years
","Fist of all: I think this film is a definite MUST SEE for everyone.<br/><br/>What scares the hell out of me, is the fact that the cloning story in this film is only a little bit off reality. Of course, clones that have the original's memories are pure fantasy, the same goes for the fast development of the clones that grow extremely fast.<br/><br/>But it is an extremely attractive business case to e.g. clone a 60 year old wealthy human being and raise the clone baby in a secret place. By the time, the original has become 80 and needs replacement organs, the clone would be adult and could serve as a ""spare part"" repository. The idea is disgusting and immoral, however, people strive for prolonged life, and I could imagine they would sell their soul to achieve this.<br/><br/>The really ugly part of the film is that the bio tech businessmen tell their customers, the clones are not ""alive"" meaning conscious. They just believe - how should they be able to verify it. So what to do when in 50 years, services like this will be a serious business? Is it acceptable to raise clones when they are not conscious? Is it acceptable to make them unconscious by destroying their brain in the fetal state? Is it OK to destroy it ""half"" so that the lower functions of the brain are still there? Ugly questions, questioning humanity itself. However, I am sure that - for big money - people will do this if states do not strictly control cloning.<br/><br/>My only relief is that such cloning business is very probable to fail, because the DNA of clones has shortened telomers (the ends of genes). This means that the clone is (from a molecular biology perspective) as old as the original (even when it looks like a child). Let's hope science does not solve this problem too fast, so that we are not faced with the above questions.<br/><br/>Yours, Patrik<br/><br/>PS: No, I'm neither conservative nor religious.

"Charizade","9","0","1","30 August 2005"," Underrated quality entertainment from a quality director
","Michael Bay has never mastered, in film-making, the category of subtlety, this portrayed in his previous works such as the explosive 'Armageddon' and the foul-mouthed violence in his 'Bad Boys' films. With his latest, Bay doesn't stray from his love of full-on action, but this time manages to infuse an intelligent story with his trademark adrenaline rushes. What first strikes you as the film opens and you are introduced to this sinister and routine future world is, intentional or not, reviving a type of communism. Once again, the characters are treated as if not human, but a mere walking product in storage. Ewan McGregor is the product in scrutiny here, as Lincoln Six-Echo, who seems the only one with questions that he encourages Jordan Two- Delta, played maturely by Johansson, to ask as well. This stereotypical blockbuster begins well; opening interesting doors to problems that are essential to answer in the later stages of the film and a promising chase that suggests the action may not be mindless and obscene but instead witty and enticing. The film remains sober, but as Bay tries to add realism it begins to slip from the tracks of what it originally set out to do. The Johansson/McGregor double act are perfectly able, but it's director of photography Mauro Fiore who makes the film what it is. Tragically this film is deprived of it's deserved success, but won't leave a bad mark on Bay's career but sadly won't be a milestone."

","In The Island, director Michael Bay (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) creates a fast-paced and exciting sci-fi action adventure - one of the best of the summer.<br/><br/>Ewen McGregor (Star Wars Episodes I, II, & III, Moulin Rouge) portrays Lincoln Six Echo, a man who lives in a self contained Utopian facility of the mid-21st century where food, exercise, and even emotions are monitored to protect the inhabitants from outside nuclear contamination. Only those lucky enough to win the lottery are chosen to live on the Island, the last uncontaminated place in the world.<br/><br/>After discovering a flying insect thriving in a restricted area, Lincoln begins to question the contamination story, and soon discovers that the lottery is a lie, and that the winners are subject to a sinister reward.<br/><br/>When his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson, Lost in Translation, The Girl with the Pearl Earring), wins the lottery, Lincoln rescues her and together they escape to the outside world. To protect his interests, facility owner Sean Bean (National Treasure, Lord of the Rings trilogy) hires a security force headed by Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator, In America) to hunt down and kill the escapees as they desperately search for help and answers. <br/><br/>Overall this is a well-made film with an excellent story, believable characters and amazing action sequences (including a vehicle reminiscent of the swamp speeders from Return of the Jedi). The second half of the film is the weakest and perhaps would have worked better as a sequel. Newly introduced characters and story lines are respectively one-dimensional and under-developed. The remarkable talents of Michael Clark Duncan, sadly underused in the first half of the film, could have been revisited here. But despite this, and the fact that Bay gets hokey Hollywood with the final scenes, we can forgive him, for the ride getting there was well worth it."

","The trailers were not sufficiently convincing that this is more than your typical wannabe blockbuster action flick. The marketing department has screwed this up really badly.<br/><br/>The movie's over-length (way more than 2 hours) is not justified. The whole plot could have been very well transported in a 90 minute time frame, cutting out some mindless chases and exaggerated stunts and fillers that were detrimental to the movie's overall credibility.<br/><br/>Too much of the movie's budget went into expensive stunt work and Fx that in effect is nothing but bloat and adds little to the plot. Excess action only works to a certain extent - exceed that threshold and it becomes parody.<br/><br/>The product placement was just horrible and in many places very distracting. Why place xbox 360 banners inside the ""prison"" that clones spend their daily routine in?

Remodels are much more rewarding.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS (Non-Spoiler) An institute full of cloned people kept as spares for people in the real world is the superficial, advertised plot (because it's not the point!). The hidden themes are more complex; slavery, ethnic rights, exploitation of women, class, territory rights (religions uprooted from homeland), vivisection, abortion, and all the other shades of moral and ethical questions. All explored in one film!<br/><br/>WHO SHOULD SEE THIS FILM?  There are two main audiences; 1) The Action type who loves fast thrills 2) The Analytical type who loves decoding hidden ideas. Both, plus others, will love this film. It is so well made. It is like traditional European cinema with its fast assumptions, tight ideas, lack of 'actual' explanation, and group/comrade characterisation. This film is unique in its current field, thus deeply misunderstood, but in the future will be a Cult Classic.<br/><br/>MY RATING  It is unusually difficult to rate or certificate this film, because it's so much fun and so mind expanding, yet deeply violent; not for children, yet great for teaching older children to really look and find meaning (if watched with an adult prompting). 9/10 for philosophy. 8/10 for presentation. 10/10 for Editing. 9/10 for Directing. 3/10 for cover story/superficial plot. 5/10 for comedy. 9/10 for Cinematography. 10/10 for cinematic experience! <br/><br/>WHY SEE THIS FILM?  It may not look awesome on a small TV at home, but this film is the hottest thing on a big cinema screen right now, because it's BIG; thinks, feels, kicks ass and has a soul (unlike other movies just now that just contain one of the above). The advantage of the DVD/Video is the chance to join-the-dots = explore the hidden motifs and find the hidden meanings. Plus the chance to watch again and again Ewan McGregor versus himself, who is comically (accent and hobbies relevant) and erotically exciting, and Scarlett Johansson who is behaviour perfect and cinematic. This is the start of great things, this Director, Michael Bay, will be the next James Cameron or Steven Spielberg, he totally understands audience needs.

","""The Island"" previews pretty much gave away the entire plot of the first half of the film, which is really a separate film entirely from the middle portion. Michael Bay proves once again that any exercise in restraint he makes is then in turn made up for by throwing in extra explosions, chases, crashes, and unlikely rescues so that the 'thinking' portion of his film is justly compensated for by the 'oooh, explody' segment.<br/><br/>That said, ""The Island"" manages, on the strength of its actors, to convey a creepy look into two futuristic tomorrows, each equally familiar to any fan of the sci-fi genre. In one, the agnates, whose personalities run the gamut from the interesting and curious Lincoln Six- Echo (McGregor) to the dull and clueless but intuitive Jordan Two-Delta (Johannsen), are the survivors of an apocalyptic event, a staple of futuristic science fiction. In the other reality, less removed from the present day in all but a few locomotive improvements, people continue to support the tenets of capitalism and pop culture rules.<br/><br/>The first part of the film, given over to the first reality and the revelation of the second, succeeds on the anguish conveyed by the dubious McGregor and the devious Bean (as Dr. Merrick). The second, with its aforementioned gratuitous use of flash-bang explosions, manages to lighten to mood and calls for a greater suspension of disbelief in the laws of physics than the first half required with regards to the current status of bio-engineering. Aside from that, no matter how mindless or repetitive the chase, Bay makes a good show of it, and the characters get a chance to prove themselves capable of surviving and a bit more intelligent than they were originally credited as being (mostly, this is applicable to Ms. Johannsen's character who, although given a biological reason for being less than savvy about her circumstances, comes off mainly as a vacuous blonde through much of the film's first act).<br/><br/>Although each segment is enjoyable in its own right, it's a shame that the eerie beginning was not allowed to hold sway over the rest of the film. Interrupting shock and horror with adrenaline and thrills seems a cheat for what was otherwise finely achieved suspense. One hopes in the future that, instead of glorying in his outsider's status, Michael Bay will attempt to keep his destructive instincts under control and allow a story to tell itself without doing so between punctuated blasts of dynamite."

I could carry on but I would spoil the film for readers who haven't seen it yet so I'll stop! <br/><br/>The bottom line is, this Movie is an emotional roller-coaster ride for two clones finding out who they really are, not just that though, they develop before your eyes into real people. That, on camera is magical! A great way to spend a evening!"
"siderite","8","0","2","16 August 2005"," Well made Free Jack remake
","Sue me, I liked this movie, especially since I've read the IMDb page AFTER seeing it. I think that the plot outline reveals too much of the plot and makes the first quarter of the film less enjoyable.<br/><br/>Maybe you remember the movie Free Jack, where Emilio Estevez was running from Antohny Hopkins and his henchman Mick Jagger. This movie is a lot like that. You add 21 century special effects and a runaway chick (rather than a semi corrupt ex girlfriend that helps the hero, like in Free Jack) and you've got yourself a block buster.<br/><br/>But I do think that Ewan McGregor made a very nice role. Scarlets role was less demanding and I do feel bad about the way she tries to look like a diva in her latest movies, even if she was gorgeously beautiful when she wasn't trying, in Lost in Translation, but she performed admirably as well.<br/><br/>The plot is nice, it mixes the Free Jack story with a bit of Matrix. It is a bit far fetched for my style, especially the way the main characters evade (and almost completely wipe out :) ) a special force team.<br/><br/>It's worth watching and for this type of movies I give it a top grade."

"ab-2","9","0","1","15 August 2005"," Michael Bay's First Great Movie
","I have never been a fan of Michael Bay for numerous reasons. The main one being he made intelligent insulting action movies. Yes, they are good action movies, but far from good movies. Also the terrible acting, writing, and vomit inducing editing didn't help as well. But, after seeing The Island, I am now convinced Michael Bay does have the ability to make a good movie. The movie takes place in the future. Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) are citizens of an underground Utopian society, people who survived an Earth destroying apocalypse. Everyone wears white, goes through the same daily routines everyday, eat the same foods, work at the same places, and don't ask questions. The one thing that everyone wants though in this society is to go to the Island, which could be compared to Heaven in many ways. The only way you get there is through a lottery system where a winner is picked (a parable to how soldiers were to be drafted and sent off to Vietnam in a similar lottery system.) Lincoln starts to develop an inquisitive mind about the world he lives in, the Island, and what lies beyond the world he lives in. When Jordan is picked to go to the Island, Lincoln discovers the real truth about the Island, and escapes his city with Jordan into the above unknown world to discover the truth behind the meaning of their existence, while trying to be stopped by a expert mercenary (Djimon Hounsou). What makes this movie better than all of other Michael Bay's movies, you may ask? EVERYTHING. The characters are strong from the start. We are drawn into their naive world and minds because we take an interest in finding out the true meaning behind everything. As the characters take steps to discover this, we are with them throughout the film. Michael Bay infuses the audience with questions about what is going. He explains little, but enough to not be too complex or too dumbed-down. He lets the characters slowly discover the mysteries that the audience is eagerly trying to solve themselves He keeps the plot moving at a brisk pace. He spends time with the characters in the plot so we know and understand why they do the things they do. There are many messages that this movie has to say and I'm quite glad they aren't hammered into us. Ewan McGregor is one of the best actors working now. He can even make a mediocre film have some credibility (ala Trainspotting). The actors love their characters, especially Ewan, whom I get the feeling, from his charisma and screen presences, was having a ball of a time working on this movie. He is an actor who always knows how to play just right. Scarlett Johansson is truly one of the best young actresses working. She isn't there just for eye candy (though she is darn good looking) or a ""damsel in distress"", but is integral to the plot as much as Ewan's character is. The other actors such as Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi and Djimon Hounsou are just great as well.<br/><br/>I can't talk about a Michael Bay movie with mentioning the action scenes. They are done superbly; they are well edited, greatly choreographed, and are rousing, thrilling spectacles. I have no quibbles with them. There is some controversy that Michael Bay put too many in. I think the action's work very well with the film and they fit very well into the film. Of course, I have some minor quibbles with this movie. The main one being the blatant, overuse of product placements in this movie. As far as product placements, they should be saved for commercials, not movies. Overall, The Island is a redemption for Michael Bay. Without the tight leash of Jerry Bruckheimer producing the film, Michael Bay has made a symbolic and movie that will bring many questions about monetary and moral ethics. It is not to be missed."

Bioengineered to perfection, their world is ultra sterile and rigidly confining. Hope lives in the form of a lottery that whisks winners away to a lavish new life on The Island, where they'll repopulate the Earth among the chosen few. Unlike his peers, Lincoln questions reality and challenges authority. Poking holes in the supposed truth, he discovers that a trip to The Island is not at all what it seems.

","I usually assume that if the critics in their ""wisdom"" say that a movie is bad, I'm likely to love it--and that was certainly true in this particular instance. I regret its relatively poor showing at the box office. I guess that other people listened. ""The Island"" was a choice for me because of the moral and ethical issues involved--of course, Ewan McGregor never hurts--so I was determined to check it out. I think that they dealt with the question realistically--if the technology becomes available, it WILL happen. Where there is money, people will use it to their own advantage, no matter the cost to others. I'm not a Michael Bay fan, so I didn't really need all the crashes and mayhem, but at least it wasn't tremendously gory. I very much liked the sly humor that kept it from being depressing, especially the encounter between Lincoln and Tom. The naive attraction between the leads was cute, and Jordan's aggressiveness when they discovered sex was priceless. In fact I very much liked the fact that the Jordan beat Lincoln in a fight and saved him when he was being beat up, as well. Also, the payoff at the end, while not totally unexpected, did satisfy my need for justice. There were some not quite understood points--like: they were given memory imprints of childhood and growing up, but they had never seen a baby or a child? Say what?? And how come Lincoln knew how (and where) to swipe the credit card to get the information booth to work? Sure, he had Tom's memories popping up, but seems like that would just include the major things--like Latin and flying... If that wasn't the case, then there's that baby question again... Hey, NO movie is perfect."

Apparently, Mr. Parkes is a very bad loser. He thinks the movie is a flop, and wants to point fingers? Very childish. And strange too, because actually he should blame himself. Isn't he the producer of this movie? Isn't he one of the people who green-lights, and controls this whole production? Doesn't he have the input in casting, shooting and bringing in this movie? Come on, Mr. Parkes, you're not a good sport. And it's totally unnecessary, too. Because The Island is just one high-octane (how else could it be?) over-the-top high concept sci-fi extravaganza spectacular flick. I really enjoyed it.

Its one of those films that really get you thinking what that would be like, such as Minority Report and The Truman Show. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansen are tanned to within an inch of their lives, but Mcgregor especially looks a lot better for it. It was very strange to see 2 Ewan Mcgregors fighting over control of the same car and also Johansen's Calvin Klein advert being included as a small part of the story, it was a nice touch. What must be mentioned and commended is that the setting of the future is not overdone - cars and motorbikes are better as is communication as every phone seems to be a video phone, and obviously the cloning thing but other than that 2005 is still recognisable within it.

The acting was sub-par in cooperating with the characters and the second half of the film was just a run away from the big bad wolf situation, like many of Bay's film. But what made this film Bay's best was not him, but the story. The idea of clones being ""harvested"" is a superb idea, especially being that the story is set in 2019. Bay makes is very believable, not cramming too much high tech gadgets and green screens into shots. Should be recognized by the academy for it's screenplay, score, and special effects.

","I went to see The Island after reading reviews by the professional guys and was not expecting too much. I was in for a surprise indeed...<br/><br/>The Island is a mix of Logan's Run, THX-1138 and The Matrix too. <br/><br/>I was really taken by the visuals in the opening scenes depicting The Island. I found the set design very cutting edge. The attention to detail of the atrium and elevators used in the movie the best that I have ever seen. I can understand how they spent a reported $150 million on the production.<br/><br/>Yes, there are a few holes in the plot here and there. One that pops up that most will not catch is the scene with Lincoln starting the car. Lincoln comments that his insurance policy really is an exact copy where he starts the car by having the same thumbprint. This may be trivial, but clones will not have fingerprints that are identical to their donors, nor anyone else for that matter. Also, kinda a stretch to have 'tri-keys' used to allow the escape instead of biometrics like fingerprints. But, hey that is a plot device that is needed for the film.<br/><br/>I wish that the movie had explored the awakening sexuality between Lincoln and Jordan more that what is shown.<br/><br/>The plot and story are very thought provoking indeed. The action is very good for a Michael Bay film. I especially loved the freeway scenes with the locomotive wheels rolling off the flatbed.<br/><br/>As a guy, however, I could not help but noticing that the women shown in the film are some of the hottest that I have seen in a movie. I was especially taken by the community announcer played by Noa Tishby. She has a face on screen that is really striking and has stayed with me even now.<br/><br/>Jordan 2 Delta, played by Scarlett Johansen is a joy to watch as well.

","This was a lot better than expected -- a good summer movie with a great cast. McGregor and Johansson have believable chemistry and are able to carry a really stylish updated version of Logan's Run, with Buscemi taking on Ustinov's former place in a familiar story of the clash between the synthetic future and the gritty but redeeming aspects of human reality. There are also nods here to other classics -- Blade Runner, Matrix, the Terminator films and even Crichton's Coma. The film stands apart not only because it follows the style of the newer generation of sci fi films like AI, I Robot and Minority Report, but also because it makes ironic and effective self-referential twists on that more recent style. The rocking action scenes are heart-pounding, but with such a great cast, it's too bad Michael Bay didn't forgo some action and let his actors explore some deeper depths in this story."

","Well this was surprisingly good. It was a film worth seeing. I hear of sue made for being a copy of another film; ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"". But it is only small parts that are near to the same story, but that story of 1979 sucked big time, this time the film is much better, and is no way near being the same story. If they would win a sue like this, most films should sue each others. It is not a copy of the old story. In Europe it is very popular, but not in USA. That is strange. But Europeans always have liked special Sci-Fi better than Americans. Maybe because in the USA you have to much cloning for real, like in the cloned milk that is illegal in Europe and Canada, but not in USA. People should be more careful of cloned things in USA.

"MrRazorz","6","0","1","11 August 2005"," Lincoln's Run?
","I'll start by stating the obvious - if you're thirty or over, then the first thing to go through your mind while watching this film will be: ""Didn't I see this when it was called Logan's Run?"" While a comparison to Michael Anderson's 1976 classic is inevitable (and it borrows a fair bit from Blade Runner and The Clonus Horror as well) The Island still stands up as a decent enough movie in its own right... well, kind of.<br/><br/>In the year 2019 (why are these movies always set in 2019?) the ""survivors"" of a global plague live in an enclosed city environment where everything is carefully monitored and controlled... for their own good, naturally. It's the kind of society where everyone dresses the same, everyone has a mindless job that they don't understand (you inject the chemicals into the tubes, but where do the tubes go?) the state tells you what to wear, what to eat and who to talk to, and your toilet analyzes your pee to tell you when you're eating too much salt. Your only hope for a better life is to win a state-controlled lottery in which the winners are selected to go to the Island - the last uncontaminated environment on Earth, where the lucky winners can live in a tropical paradise, romping on the beach, swimming in the ocean and breeding like rabbits to repopulate the Earth. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, there's a reason for that...<br/><br/>The feaces hits the oscillator when two inhabitants of the city - Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) figure out that the whole thing is an elaborate sham. The city is a fake environment underneath a hospital complex, its inhabitants are clones of people living out in the real world, and those who win the lottery sure as hell aren't going to a tropical paradise...<br/><br/>It's certainly not original (I kept half-expecting McGregor to run through the city screaming ""Soylent Green is people!!!"") but it's entertaining enough. McGregor does a nice job of portraying both the perplexed clone and his smarmy cell donor (with two different accents, which was a nice bit of attention to detail) and Scarlett Johansson is... well, incredibly hot, but she can act as well. More good stuff comes from Sean Bean as the arrogant doctor running the show, Ethan Phillips (anybody remember Benson?) as Lincoln's geeky workmate, and Steve Buscemi as, er... Steve Buscemi. I personally think it should win the gong for Original Score, and some of the imagery is mind-blowing, especially in the dream sequence at the start. It does have a big problem in that most of the middle of the film is an extended noisy chase sequence, which drags on way too long and gets kind of boring - it's not a good thing when your mind starts wandering in the middle of a film. There are also a few niggling plot holes (especially near the end) and the conclusion of the film leaves a few too many questions unanswered.<br/><br/>All round, though, it's not a bad flick. It's just that... it's been done."

","Lets not kid ourselves. We have all seen this before. The future where all is cool, but not so cool. But you know what, it doesn't stop it for being fun to see it again. This time around Michael Bay gives us the Island, a film about 90 percent Logan's Run and 10 Percent the Running Man. It's the future and all are perfect and all are kind of stupid. Everyone acts the same, think the same and even dress the same. It's a perfect utopian society. Everyday the inhabitants are entered into a contest (well practically every day), where they can win a permanent vacation to paradise. They all want it. But, one gets to see whats behind the wizard's curtain...<br/><br/>This is what Michael Bay does best. He combines CGI with fast camera movements and familiar faces. He is trying to entertain us. He isn't trying to give us the best story, what he is trying to do is give us a good time at the movies. I think he does it. Ewan McGregor is a fun actor to watch and no matter what the role is, you know he believes in it. He does a really good job here in the role he is given. Scarlett Johannson (sp?) is inconsequence, but she is use as a motivating tool to put our main star in action. Normally, in this type of films, the female character doesn't get a whole lot to do but be in peril. They may give them one good fight scene (or love scene) and that is about it. Think of Michael Bay other films (Armageddon, The Rock, Pearl Harbor to name a few) and just think how really important were the females in those films. Nevertheless, its how Hollywood wants their action films and so with The Island, we get the same formula we always get from Hollywood, but in a faster, prettier picture. The CGI stunts look awesome and it was a popcorn eating fun picture. I think the critics may have been expecting THX-1138. Oh well, I recommend seeing this film as a matinée."
"Janibal","8","0","3","9 August 2005"," What a gorgeous cutie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","OK, I might be biased by my general appreciation of Michael Bay Action movies, my major (biology/genetics) and my weakness for new hot young actresses, but this movie totally rocked! You know, I usually don't expect too much logic in this kind of movies especially in the action sequences, and some might say in this case the movie was flawed (the falling R), but in my opinion, that didn't hurt too much. One could argue that the movie itself was divided into two major parts: The first part: ""Decontamination facility""? , the second part: Run, my clones run! The first part really was kind of cool, I just love it when movies start this strange, you don't know what's really going on and what's the deal, and one after another, you start to realize what's it all about. I think it would have been even cooler if the movie hadn't been propagated and hyped like ""dealing with the cloning issue"", so no one would have known in the first place what this strange facility was all about, but it was too obvious from the trailers and the ads, otherwise it would have accounted for a similarly ingenious twist like in Fight club or Six sense, just not in the end of the movie, but in the middle. OK, already hear the critics, arguing that it all doesn't make any sense to put up so much fuse just to keep ""living organ donors"" ""happy"", but I think most have to admit, a great idea very well suited for a major blockbuster movie. In some ways, it reminds me of the Matrix (1, of course!!), just that it were ""living power plant donors"" there and admittedly, constructing the matrix itself is a lot of fuse as well! OK, and in the second part, Michael Bay plays it full, unfolding action to the max, well paced and placed after the suspense-like first part. As I've already mentioned, you could criticize some scenes, like why didn't the truck driver notice losing his over-sized handle bars (causing a major traffic pandemonium, by the way) and stop his vehicle immediately or why is everything in 2019 so mixed, hyper-modern hover-crafts and monorails (From Ogdenville or North Haverbrook? ;-) vs. old truck stops including bad 80s rock and recent cars? And maybe they could have taken some new (and even hotter, yummy!!!!) TV-ads from Scarlett Johanson customized especially for the ambient of the movie instead of the regular from the real life. Well, Scarlett is definitely one of the biggest pluses of the movie, at least for me, but I might be too biased here (see title of my comment) so I better won't even try to judge on her acting. I think all other actors did a good job and were well-suited for the movie, man, didn't realize that the doctor was Boromir until my friends told me after the movie, embarrassing! Of course, the obligate final end fight between the doctor (who comes ALONE without security) and Ewan, partly bare-handed (oh man!) is a little, well, cheesy but what do you expect, action flick with big boss fight in the end, that's how it's got to be I guess, it's Michael Bay ! I still wonder why the doctor, the boss and initiator of it all, bothered to play the psychiatrist of his ""products"", I think he should have enough trouble with the medicine aspect and the PR, the whole facility must be so damn expensive that a fake psychologist would not make a huge difference!"

Like Ebert said, something to the effect that Shawn Bean is the best Shawn Bean on films these days. Also, lots to think about in terms of a possible unintended consequence of human cloning.<br/><br/>But one serious fundamental problem with the logic underlying this entire story. The insured parties are millionaires and other famous people who have the wealth sufficient to pay for the laboratory work, birth, development and expensive maintenance of clones that are to be kept around in relative ignorance until the insured needs one or more of their body organs, grown specifically for their use as spare parts.<br/><br/>But the clone or no, the 'insurance policy' is a walking, talking, thinking human being. Not just with enforceable constitutional rights, as was neatly forgotten or ignored by the writers of this film script. But more significant is that they age at the same rate as their insured parties.<br/><br/>So, assuming Thomas Lincoln and Sarah Jordan were at least about 30 years old before they were rich and famous enough to donate DNA for their respective clones, and assuming that Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta were each about 25 years old by the time they crashed the island in the middle of the desert, that their insured parties were about 55 years of age or better, and would not at all resemble their clones.<br/><br/>Or are we to assume these clones are instantly hatched as full-grown adults?

","In some respects, The Island is something of a departure for director Michael Bay from the usual. Oh, there is no doubt that this film comes from the same individual who gave us The Rock and Armageddon; it's full of the same high-octane, fast-paced action, but it also shows that Bay can indulge the more intellectual side of the medium, although apparently only to a point.<br/><br/>The Island is a thriller that is part sci-fi, part action film, and it uses the ethics and practice of cloning as it's basis. This isn't a new idea, there have been several other films that have addressed cloning before, at it also isn't a new concept to meld action with cloning, that was already done in The 6th Day. But the package as assembled is reasonably entertaining and holds your attention for it's running time.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a character named Lincoln Echo Six (Ewan McGregor), who lives in a massive multistory facility with many other individuals. They are all led to believe they are survivors of a great environmental holocaust that has rendered the world incapable of supporting life. The only remaining ""pathogen-free"" zone is called The Island, and the survivors are given a random opportunity to be sent to the Island through a regular lottery. The inhabitants of this contained world are monitored for health and nutrition and given various menial tasks to accomplish. Lincoln has developed a friendship with another member of the society, named Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johannson), who wins the lottery to go to the island. After discovering an insect in the service areas of the plant, Lincoln explores further and discovers that their existence is actually a fraud. There is no Island, Lincoln and the others are clones of rich, powerful individuals in the outside world. There is no contamination, and the clones exist to provide replacement organs and other items to the clients who ordered them and can afford the hefty price tag. With the desire to save his own existence and that of his best friend, Lincoln escapes from the facility, with Jordan in tow, and meets up with a technician he had befriended at the facility (Steve Buscemi) who sets them in direction of their ""sponsors"" to try and reveal the truth to the world. Meanwhile, the facility owner, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), desperate to ensure the truth is not revealed to the world, hires a freelance hit team to bring back his ""products,"" led by a man named Albert (Djimon Hounsou).<br/><br/>The basic quandary that the Island focuses on, the ethics of cloning, is an interesting one to explore, and The Island does raise some questions concerning the moral dilemmas of the possibility of using clones as a source of ""spare parts"" for humans, but much like 1990's Total Recall, aside from introducing the issue, it doesn't quite take the material to a higher ground. We don't see the repercussions that might evolve out of the populous discovering that the rich and powerful have paid for living humans to be created and then eventually slaughtered so that the originals can go on living. After introducing the premise the film swings into full on action mode, featuring several chases, shoot-outs and fight sequences. The action sequences are well staged, and more than a little engaging, so from the point-of-view of serving as an entertaining action vehicle, The Island does it's job well, but those looking for a little more meat to the moral quandaries introduced will walk away feeling short-changed.<br/><br/>As with all of Bay's films, The Island has a very slick look, with gorgeous production design by Nigel Phelps and very atmospheric cinematography by Mauro Fiore. The film also features Michael Bay's trademark: fast-paced, breakneck-speed editing. I enjoy a good action sequence as much as the next man, but do all of his have to edited as if by a spastic child? Bay does keep it a little more on the ground than some of his previous turns; it's not quite as overdone as, say, Armageddon, but it is still a bit much for my taste.<br/><br/>On the acting front, most of the performers are capable, turning in effective performances, but no one is pushing their limit. Ewan McGregor has some fun scenes playing both Lincoln and his ""sponsor"" opposite each other, differentiated by the accents in their voice, but its nothing that hasn't been seen in some form before. Sean Bean does his best snarling as the villain, but he keeps it from going over the top.<br/><br/>The Island is that sort of middle-ground movie that is featured most every summer: intriguing idea not fully fleshed out, blended with heavy action to fulfill what is believed to be what the audience wants. It is effective at what it does, you just wish it did a little more."

","well, my personal opinion is: if you want to cray, lets see STEEL MAGNOLIAS but to have a great time and see an entertaining story, thats why films as THE ISLAND are great. I liked the story, nice and entertained film and for sure, great acting by Sean, Djimon, Ewan and specially my princess Scarlett. I think we have films of all kind, and this one was very good for his own purpose. 9 points of 10.... The top-grossing film of history i thought it was soooooooo bad, and look.... so while michael bay continues doing this work, like bad boys, the rock, pearl harbour or the island, he will can always count with my vote."
"mhajs","8","0","1","7 August 2005"," If you can get past some stuff...
","***1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>This might be a fun movie, if you get past some things. For example, in the beginning of it, you may not like much, since it's a completely rip-off of George Lucas' THX-1138 (1971) where there's also a controlled society living in an underground city, with more rules than privileging, and everyone is dressed on white. I like to think that this wasn't an imitation of THX at all, but a remake of the movie, at the same time, with the originality of a new movie. People might think that Michael Bay wanted to do exactly what George Lucas didn't in THX, and that we find out not too late. There's even a scene where we see Ewan McGregor and Sean Bean in a room where Bean is the spiritual and medical helper of McGregor considering his dislodgement of some of the rules in the establishment.<br/><br/>The Island is a movie which has high influences on science fictions movies such as THX-1138 (1971), Blade Runner (1982) and even The Matrix (1999). It gets some of the ideas of each of these movies, but adds others too. That's what saved the movie. I must say also that I liked a lot McGregor and Johansson... together. Not performances as somewhat to win an Oscar, but they make a nice couple throughout the movie. The story goes as a society living in an underground city (same thing as THX), where people who live there are monitored everywhere (even in their rooms). Men can't have their rooms in the same sector as the womens'. There's a proximity limit for a man and a woman to obey and in some scenes when Ewan and Scarlett are almost kissing each other, a guard comes nearby and separates them. They live there, because there has been a contamination in the outside world and when they're brought in, they are treated the same way as of The Matrix's, when they're released from a cocoon bag or something like that and start to ""breathe"" for the first time. But everything is just a lie made up by the people who control those who live there. They're actually clones of original people who live in the outside world. They are made up, because when a person needs to make a transplant of something, they will need the clones. This is a truly brand new idea in a science fiction movie and The Island scores big in that.<br/><br/>In order to like this movie, you must be patient. Don't get frustrated too much on the many, many bizarre action sequences of the movie, or you may dislike it. Specially the one that involves a building and an ""R"". The rest of the cast includes Djimon Hounson, Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve Buscemi in a role most like the others typical of him. His funniest line might be: ""Just because you wanna know from where the hamburgers came from, doesn't mean you wanna meet the cow"". There's a scene involving him and Ewan and Scarlett and there's a dialog exactly the same from one of Blade Runners'. As I said. The Island has many influences on other movies. But as long as it has something new to present, it won't be considering by some as a +1 in the sci-fi genre."
"caligirl4eva92","9","0","2","5 August 2005"," Excellent movie, but not for someone who hates full-on action movies.
","I just saw this movie today. I thought it was an excellent movie, however, it was very loud! It takes place in 2019. Wealthy people can pay to have a clone created of themselves so if in the future, they need any organs replaced, they get it from them. And it's not cheap. $5 million! These clones are created full born at the age of their owners. Memories are in-planted into their minds, so the childhood they thought they had, never happened. They live underground in a cement place, and wear all white. The images they see through windows are all holographic. They are told that earth is contaminated, and where they live is safe. There is a weekly lottery, and the winner gets to go to the 'Island', the last safe place on earth with clean water and air. When they are being taken to the 'island', they really are being taken to where one of their organs is going to be taken and given to their sick owner. Also, the female clones can have babies, which are given to the actual mother and father after the clone is killed. Their names (e.g. Licoln 6 Echo. Licoln for the last name of the owner, 6 for the area where their owner lives and Echo for what year they are born.) are chosen by the details of their owner and year they are born.<br/><br/>But all the 'Echos' have a defect in them, which eventually causes the main character (Ewan McGregor) to find out the truth and escape, taking somebody with him (Scareltt Johanson). There are a lot of chase scenes and one minor sex scene (just making out). Not for someone who hates loud movies!"
"CarPort1","9","0","2","4 August 2005"," Wow -- I was pleasantly surprised!
","I loved this movie, and I didn't expect to. I went only for Ewan McGregor, expecting just another high budget/low common denominator action flick (I suppose it was in many ways, but I don't care). I'm not familiar with the director but have since been informed that he's responsible for many a Hollywood crapfest. So what; this movie hooked me in and kept me going even though I had figured out ""the secret"" early on, mostly due to the fact that it was heavily influenced by Logan's Run. I liked the other '70s sci-fi flick references, too (even such an off-the-wall quote from FutureWorld), many of which were social and/or environmentally conscious, and Ewan's personal references. Admittedly, there are some flaws (continuity errors and lapses in logic), but I turned a blind eye. I can understand why some people think it's overblown and that makes it a somewhat guilty pleasure (my favourite kind!).<br/><br/>The whole the cast was great as well and it was fun to see Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johanson together again (my how she's grown since Ghost World!). The one disappointment: Ewan's erection-reaction scene seems to have been cut. His penis seems to be problematic for American audiences; it's happened before. Well, hopefully it will be on the DVD."
"sbsyd207","8","0","3","2 August 2005"," ""More than just waiting to go to the Island""
","The Island was so much more than anyone can see from the previews. As a faithful Ewan McGregor fan, I was expecting him to be the life of the party. It was so much more than that. The plot was unpredictable sending a ripple of gasps down the isle, as well as a few moments of laughter. The effects were not overly done or cheesy, as a movie of this genre can easily become. And you never watched any of the stunts with the thought that ""There was no way they survived that!"" The innocence of the characters wasn't overpowering to a point where they were stupid, but it did bring a sense of ignorance to the world around them. <br/><br/>What really happened to clones was really intense and a little scary. It wasn't like so many action movies these days where their fear was just that they were to be killed. It was that they were to be cut into pieces. The audience really was fearful, not for themselves, but for the characters. The deaths of the clones were horrific and showed the magnitude of the situation before the clones could begin to run. <br/><br/>One of the most powerful facts of the movie is what proclaimed the clones ""human"". This was natural curiosity. The questioning of the world around them made them human. Not some technicality.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great. A brilliant blend of action, romance, and drama explode across the screen making it worth while. A very refreshing blend of ""Bicentenial Man"" and ""The Matrix"" makes ""The Island"" a great summer action film that will leave you breathless."

","First of all, don't just go see this movie because almost every other movie in the theater sucks, but because it is simply a great movie. The story line was very unique and kept me glued to the seat the whole time and if you are worried about it being another Minority Report, don't. The action and acting is much much better and you'll probably want to see it twice. The plot may seem some what tricky to understand so here is a quick summary. Ewan McGregor, Scarlett Johansson, and many more humans live in a closed environment, because they think the world is contaminated. But Lincoln Six Echo (McGregor) soon comes to find out that it is all a lie and they are really clones of rich people in the real world. So Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta (Johansson) set out to find their sponsors and tell the world what is going on. But the owner of the clone factory played by Sean Bean hires people to stop them before they reach their owners. This all then collides into a ball of hot steamy action which you will love. So I give it 8 stars and will claim it one of the summers best films. Enjoy!!!!1"

","""The Island"" had a fairly decent storyline and a good production quality. It had a dreamy Gattaca feel to it, with vivid colors and tall, simple architecture generously placed throughout. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, about halfway through the film, Warshowski-brother-style gratuitous action sequences emerged. I say unfortunately because they were unnecessary. The film had plenty of momentum without the continuous barrage of Die Hard In The Near Future explosions, chases, blah blah blah. Yawn. I think it would have been a great movie if, say, 20 minutes of action were removed. I found myself daydreaming, rather than focusing on the movie, the rest of which was quite enjoyable."

The producer (Bay) makes very surreal movies. I don't understand the black guy, who is a hired gun, actions at the end of the movie. Bean always plays a bad guy.

","The Island, action, thriller, comedy... it was great! Ewan McGregor and Scarlotte Johanson were above amazing in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie starts off with an organization that created clones of important people. If the people had a bad organ or body part, they go to the clones, kill them, and take out the parts needed. When a clone is needed to have it's organ taken out, they are told they are going to spend paradise on an Island. As far as the clones know, there has been a virus spread all over the earth, and the only two places that haven't been effected is the island and the place where they were created. This lie was to have the clones scared to go outside, to see the real world. This lie didn't work for Lincoln Six Echo played by Ewan McGregor. Lincoln Six Echo and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson) run away from the square, setting on an adventure to find their owners.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie 8 out of 10, because it had fast action and never a dull moment."

To be confronted with new technology and new surroundings all the while fighting for a chance at freedom and to live their own lives.

There is no question that Michael Bay is one off the greatest action directors to ever have graced the genre. The plot concerns a Utopian world where males and females are harvested for their organs. There are some thought provoking ideas here (if) you look at it from a retro-1950's perspective, but it does set up the action scenes nicely. there some amazing visuals. There are two freeway chase sequences, one of which has some the prettiest car crashes ever seen. Pretty, but heart quickening.

","I walked into the movie theater, intrigued to see ""The Island"", but not expecting much except a few cheap thrills and a slightly entertaining plot. What I got was a lot more. I was never bored--the action sequences went neither too long or too brash. I felt that with a little suspension of belief, the plot was quite believable. The chemistry between 'JordanTwoDelta' and 'LincolnSixEcho' was amazingly believable, despite the age difference of McGreggor and Johhanson. Both, I felt, did a great job portraying the innocence of these clones. There were a few plot holes, mind you, but I didn't mind filling them in with my imagination because much of the information is implied in this film. Save for a few cheesy lines-""There really is an island--it's us!""--and a mildly confusing plot line, it was a great flick. I was a bit confused at first, and I'm usually quick with movies, but by the end, I was clear. The Island is entertaining and the end is quite a treat--some beautiful cinematography.

","The Island is not the usual Sci-Fi movie. It's not the usual fights with humans and clones nor is it about fraudness, like in Multiplicity or The Sixth Day. This is a movie first of its kind taken from the perspective of a clone. <br/><br/>The plot is good, and coupled with some good acting, and some awesome special effects it is quite promising. Both Ewan Mcgregor and Scarlett Johansson puts up good displays. Sean Bean puts up another great show as the ever enigmatic villain. <br/><br/>The story is basically, that a secret underground bunker is being used as a human clone laboratory. The clones are made so as to free the human world of pain and diseases. The clones donate body organs for transplants, bear the child for the mother, but as soon as their purposes are served they are killed away. SeanBean the person in charge of this society does a great job. For once we realize that all his intentions are good but are used as a bad propaganda. The clones as he puts it are not humans, but vegetative organisms, incapable tot think and live a life as a human. Lincoln Echo 6 was the first to break out of this rule. He started to think about the facility, kept asking questions. The clones were told that there was a massive radiation contamination in the earth, thats why people were kept there safe. Each month there was a lottery where a person was sent to a paradise isle called The Island. ""The Island"" in fact was no more than a myth, in other words, it was the Operation Theater for them, signifying that their purpose was served and they were to be finished of soon enough. Lincoln Echo 6 discovered the hard truth, and knowing that his best friend Jordan Delta 2 was also headed to the Islnd, he takes up matters in his own hands. He escapes the facility with her out in the real world, to face the hard truth. There was no contamination at all. After that they overcome all odds to survive in the real world, throwing off the trail of a deadly assassin after them. In the end they return to the facility to over rule the authorities freeing all the people inside. <br/><br/>The Action sequences of this movie is superb, makes you think back to the days of the Matrix. Don't be surprised if it walks away with an award later this year for visual effects. The camera work is superb. Ewan Mcgregor was amazing and so was Sean Bean. And you can't just describe in words how good Scarlett Johansson was. She was awesome, and SO hot. <br/><br/>The score was also mind blowing, (I have already ordered for my copy in amazon.com) Michael Bay does a good job in this movie, and a overall 9/10 for me..."

The island intertwines emotion with action seamlessly creating a story that is both moving and inspirational. not only do the two leads, Ewan McGregor and Scarlet Johanson fit their roles but they play them to perfection. The score too is perfect for the movie. Certainly, as with many sci-fi futuristic films the story line has flaws, but these flaws are only minor. indeed, the story line is fast paced, action and emotion packed and the film is full of directional flourishes. The Island really does take you away to some place magical, and even though the reality of the movie makes a valid commentary on societies social values one cant help but wish, if only for the first half hour, that they could be chosen; to go to the island."

","If the only reason you go to the movies is to see big explosions and lots of special effects, then The Island is the movie for you... unless, that is, you're prone to motion sickness.<br/><br/>The Island has plenty of explosions and nice special effects shots, but what it's missing is depth, a sense of reality, and a good steady cam. While shaky camera-work is an effective means of making the audience feel as if they are in the movie alongside the characters, The Island reaches greater heights of motion sickness inducing tremors than any movie since The Bourne Supremacy. I could ride a mechanical bull on a tiny boat in the middle of a stormy sea with no problems, but it only took a couple of minutes of The Island's ultra-close, bouncy camera-work to turn me three shades of green.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from a tragic lack of realism that makes it difficult to maintain a proper suspension of disbelief -- even for a sci-fi action flick. Each scene is more outrageous and unbelievable than the one before, culminating in a true bubble-breaker where the main characters fall 70 stories from the side of a building and walk away with barely a scratch. Action movies can get away with quite a bit -- we expect the heroes to be a bit larger than life -- but the things that the characters in The Island live through are simply a bit too much.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the acting is quite decent with the exception of a few unfortunate scenes. Sean Bean delivers another excellently sinister performance as the film's antagonist, and Djimon Hounsou is quite convincing as the ex-military security specialist on the trail of the escaped clones. The plot is also relatively solid, if somewhat predictable, though it fell somewhat short of exploring the themes of the film with any real depth.<br/><br/>In terms of Michael Bay's other films, I'd rank The Island somewhat below Bad Boys, but above Bad Boys II."

Well, for those of you who have yet to see it, plan to, and have done one of the above, I feel you may be slightly disappointed when Lincoln and Jordan discover the truth: they're clones. That tiny intrigue for the audience is unfortunately spoiled by t.v.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie had a good story but a silly action director who didn't know that there's more than action to some movies. I felt there were too many ""macho man"" and ""be-on-edge"" shots. They kept your interest, however, and they did entertain me, but it didn't make sense how this underground corporation got away with destroying half the city just to cover up the clones' presence in the city. I guess it's things like that that separate your action flick from your action movie. <br/><br/>I feel that the acting was good. I especially enjoyed Ewan as Tom Lincoln. I hadn't seen him act like a jerk until this film and I found it refreshing. Scarlett Johansson seemed like she was casted merely for her looks. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to look at good looking people, but there again the action movie/action flick line is drawn. Even Sean Bean, who we all know as LOTR's Boromir, was his bad self and did a good job. But I feel Michael Bay is at fault for all of the bad reviews that are surrounding this movie. <br/><br/>If you look past the stereotypes and corny action flick lines, (""They're gonna hack you up."") you'll find a decent story that was unfortunately wasted."
"MovieMan-217","7","0","1","27 July 2005"," Good blend of previous movies.
","I would say that this movie has elements from, at least, the following three movies:<br/><br/>Logan's Run (1976) - 6.6<br/><br/>* Characters running for their lives after realizing that the wonderful journey they are privileged to go on is just death.<br/><br/>Coma (1978) - 6.8<br/><br/>* People harvested for their organs. In coma, they are suspended from wires in a coma state. In this movie, they are placed on tables and brainwashed until they reach a controllable state.<br/><br/>The Truman Show (1998) - 7.7 <br/><br/>* The fact that you a constantly being monitored. Also, the endless and beautiful horizon is just a painted wall - or a hologram in this case.<br/><br/>Averaging those three movies gives 7.03 which is right on the mark for this one."
"JoeKarlosi","7","0","3","27 July 2005"," The Island (2005) ***
","Reviews for this film have trickled in which say it's a ripoff of other movies. So I suppose I've come to the conclusion that one can enjoy a movie even when it's said to be copied from another film (or films), so long as you're unaware of the fact while viewing it. Such was the case with me when I watched THE ISLAND, which I enjoyed very much; so much so, in fact, that I almost gave it an extra half star (but more on that later). To me, at least during the time I was watching it, this was an intriguing and new concept, as I haven't yet seen many of its noted forerunners, aside from, possibly, LOGAN'S RUN (1976). Taken on its own, this is an interesting and emotional story, with director Michael Bay's reputation for sensational action kicking into high gear for at least a few breathtaking sequences along the way.<br/><br/>Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johansson are extremely good as two ""survivors"" in a futuristic underground society, where they are conditioned to live healthy lifestyles along with hundreds of other ""lucky people"". Each inhabitant is warned that the outside world has become contaminated and unlivable, so everyone will remain and work together with the dream that, one special day, any individual at some given time may win a ""lottery"" and be chosen to be transported to what is called ""The Island"" for a future of happiness and contentment. MacGregor becomes curious of his very existence and the way his community is run, and eventually seeks to find out more. Escaping with his friend Johansson, their discovery is shocking and a hefty warning to our world today of what could happen tomorrow if we aren't careful.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything else away here, but this film kept me wondering what would happen from beginning to end. Are we witnessing life as it will be after a future apocalypse? Or is there something more corrupt afoot? While trying to find out, we are taken for a joy ride along with our two young leads, and get to savor a fine performance from Sean Bean (as the untrustworthy Merrick), as well as a fun characterization from Steve Buscemi, who was perfectly cast in his part and is given some pretty humorous dialogue.<br/><br/>The only reason I found myself shaving half a star from my rating was that the movie offered roughly ten too many climaxes and seemed to go on too long. Which is a shame, as I would otherwise have deemed this a very good science fiction/action film, indeed. As it turned out, it's a good one - and what you don't know about the other films it borrows from won't hurt you. *** out of ****"
"sith_happens","9","0","4","25 July 2005"," It's not ""The Clonus Horror""...
","... it's ""Logan's Run"". Now, don't get me wrong, I surprisingly loved ""The Island"". Bay's movies usually give me migraines; here, he restrains himself for nearly an hour of the running time, actually holding shots for more than three seconds, actually allowing intrigue and tension to build, rather than his usual method of letting all hell break loose before the credits roll. This is a good thing, and it helps make ""The Island"" easily Bay's best film. But don't go in expecting anything even remotely original; there are so many points of similarity with ""Logan's Run"", I won't be at all surprised when the copyright violation suit gets filed. Replace ""domed city"" with ""underground city"". Replace ""carousel"" with ""the lottery"". Replace ""sanctuary"" with ""the island"". Replace ""Logan Five"" with ""Lincoln Six Echo"". And on and on. Even the structure of the two films -- intro, buildup, breakout, chase, return, freedom -- is, ah, remarkably similar."
"Martina_Helene","9","0","3","25 July 2005"," Finally, a GOOD action flick!
","A refreshing, tency bit clichéd, fun, sci-fi, action thriller!! This is definitely one of the best action movies I have seen in a while!! Not the most original (has aspects of Matrix, and other important sci fi and action films) but good enough. The concept was quite interesting, there are people being held inside an area because of a planetary contamination. They are made to follow strict rules concerning dress code, sleeping patterns, eating habits, and interaction with others. Every once in a while a new survivor of the contamination shows up. These people look forward to one thing, and that is the Island, the last uncontaminated place on earth, and every day or so another person gets picked to leave and go to the Island. Lincoln Six Echo has questioned these practices and by roaming through the sphincters realizes that there is no ISland and everyone who supposedly goes there gets killed or goes through deadly surgery. Needing to save his friend, Jordan Two Delta who is next to go to the Island, they make an escape and realize that they are clones of people who pay millions of dollars to have them made. Little do these payers know that the clones actually have feelings! Jordan and Lincoln go on a wild goose chase with lots of bash em up fun action, with time for a sex scene in there (the clones are programmed not to have a strong sex drive-thats why it's there first time). Lincoln meets the person that he is a clone of, and Jordan sees pictures because she is a model. With help of some other people the clones are set free in the end!! The acting is pretty believable for an action flick, I mean how can you go wrong with Scarlett Johannson and Ewan McGregor. The cinematography is eye candy too. The only two problems I have with this movie is that it runs a bit long (a little over two hours), they could have easily edited out about 10-15 minutes of it. And, it takes place in 2019, which is hard for me to believe. Overall, this is a compelling, fun, and good movie- I would definitely suggest seeing it on the large screen! 9/10"
"kingchad10","10","0","4","25 July 2005"," Great new fresh story
","The Island is a great change from the common action movie. The story is new, and fresh. Maybe not the whole Clone concept, but the time/date and feel of the film.<br/><br/>The main story is a Scientist has created a living organism, with given the correct DNA, could be cloned like any other regular person. The ""clients"" pay big bucks to have clones made of them. Why you say?. Well it's simple if something happens to you in the real world like a failed liver. Then you just get your Clones Liver as a replacement. Since it is the same as you in every way, there would be no body issue's with it.<br/><br/>The Scientist calms to it's clients that the organism do feel, and have no life, but later on they found that if the organism didn't have a life the organs would fail. So secretly underground they kept the clones living in this head quarters.<br/><br/>The clones are lead to believe that the world outside these walls is all destroy, and they are the survivors. There is one place where it is OK to live outside in the real world, called ""The Island"". All the clones are lead to believe that the Island is a place where you can live like a real human, in Paradise. The Truth is that the clones don't know about is that their is no Island and when someone wins to go to the Island it means that their human counter part needs their organs to live. The clones lead to believe they'll be getting Paradise are killed for organs.<br/><br/>The whole movie is based around a Scientist trying to play god. Great Movie i really enjoyed it 10 out of 10"
"exoster25","9","0","3","25 July 2005"," Fun, Entertaining Movie
","Going into this movie, you just know it's going to be a good time, considering it's directed by Michael Bay. But at the same time it surprised me that he actually blended story with action and even the parts without any action are fun. There is definitely a bit of Sci-fi, and I'm not usually a big sci-fi guy, but with this I could definitely enjoy it. The women I saw the movie with, weren't extremely excited by it, but that's to be understood considering all the action. There are some parts where Mcgregor seems a bit thin, but it's easy to overlook. This movie isn't gonna win best picture. But with it's mix of good story, good cast, and fun, fast moving pace, this is as good of a time as any movie I've seen lately."
"mio1kenobi","9","0","4","25 July 2005"," Go watch it!
","Taking it for what it is, ""The Island"" really is a fantastic sci-fi/action flick that even those that aren't particularly fans of the genre can appreciate and enjoy.<br/><br/>Visually the film is extremely appealing; chock-full with impressive stunts and beautiful futuristic settings. The story is quite good and all of the characters were perfectly cast. McGregor and Johansson both look great! <br/><br/>I wouldn't read too much about the story because I think it would be far more enjoyable just to go in open-minded and see it. The movie makes for a rather nice little get-away. It is refreshingly original and definitely worth seeing in theaters at least once!"
"shotgun95pam","10","0","3","25 July 2005"," Very good
","Very good movie, reflects my fears of cloning very well, was gritty and somewhat disturbing in parts but needed to be to show how easily cloning can get out of control. The scene where the baby was born was especially disturbing, and so was the incinerator scene near the end. Sean Bean did an excellent job acting playing the bad guy. The various twists in the plot, and the fact that they didn't let the audience in on their plan until later and the twists made it even more fun to watch. The scenes filmed in Detroit were excellent! We had fun watching them film them here in Detroit and I'm amazed how it translated onto the big screen with all the extra buildings and backgrounds added. Very cool."

","THE ISLAND (2005) ** Ewan McGregor, Scarlett, Johansson, Djimon Hounsou, Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Ethan Phillips, Shawnee Smith. Director Michael Bay's hodgepodge futuristic sci-fi action thriller is a patchwork of previous genre plottings including ""THX-1138"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Gattaca"", ""Soylent Green"", ""The Sixth Day"", ""1984"" and ""Parts: The Clonus Horror"" (!) mixed with ""The Fugitive"" in this relentless cautionary tale about cloning with McGregor and Johansson as clones who discover their world has been one giant lie and decide to escape from their evil creator, Bean (hamming it up big time) to warn the real world about the tampering of humanity. The screenplay by Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci attempt to breathe fresh air into a tired sub genre  the sci-fi morality fable and totalitarian warning of a bleak future with middling results but Bay knows how to keep the pulse quicken with his trademark breakneck editing and pacing particularly in the film's climactic hairy car chase sequence that makes it worth the price of admission to see the carnage on a huge screen. Otherwise it is a forgettable overbaked concoction of corporate misdeeds and misgivings."
"vhsiv","7","0","1","24 July 2005"," Michael Bay has a brain. Who knew?
","As a first-time outing without the overadrenalized Jerry Bruckheimer, 'The Island' comes off as a well considered project. While few of the ideas posited in this new film are 'new', Bay and screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci have done a more than serviceable job of recycling ideas from other movies that arrived D.O.A.<br/><br/>'The Island' is of course a remake of 'Parts:The Clonus Horror', one of the most sordid of D-grade Mystery-Science Theater 3000 candidates - 'Coma' made on a budget of $350,000. Straight-to-video? Straight-to-the-SciFi Channel? Not even close. Even Albert Pyun never managed to stink 'em up this bad - though he came close, many a time.<br/><br/>But I'm supposed to be talking 'The Island' here, and not 'The Clonus Horror'. The Island' is a good movie, built on a solid script, excellent production values and sound performances delivered by A-list actors. As I sat in the theater watching this movie, I found myself going through a mental checklist, ""'Logan's Run', check. 'The Island of Dr. Moreau', check. 'Brave New World', check. 'Revenge of the Sith', check. There are even shades of 'Total Recall' and 'Gattaca' buried in here, as the film is a dystopia-buried-in-a-futuristic-consumer-fantasy kind of flick. The question remains, though - was this picture brought to fruition by Michael Bay, or just one of the higher-ups at Dreamworks SKG - SKG as in Spielberg, Katzenberg and Geffen.<br/><br/>Ewan MacGregor redeems himself here, for the 6 years he spent trying to imitate Alec Guiness in the woebegone 'Star Wars' prequels. There's a wonderful long moment in the film where we're reminded he was once Scottish - 'Shallow Grave', 'Trainspotting' anyone? And OMG! Scarlett Johansson is actually a fairly attractive woman - I really couldn't tell before, with her abused girlfriend and serfdom turns in 'Lost In Translation' and 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. Again, who knew? But the former Director Bay manages to shine through in some areas, with his signature explosions and oddballs in the supporting cast: Steve Buscemi, showing greater range than evidenced before, demeans himself once again, while Ethan 'Neelix' Philips shows up to disgrace himself as a roly-poly balding-on-top Stryker refugee.<br/><br/>For shame! Is it possible to have a Michael Bay movie without cartoonish archetypes? Michael Mann got over it - I suggest that Bay get ahold of the manual and further his attempts at meaningful content. There may be something more memorable than 'Armageddon' or 'Pearl Harbor' in Bay's future. Let's hope that he's able to continue the evolution and that audiences can catch up."
"supercygnus","8","0","3","23 July 2005"," An Island Worth Visiting
","So Bay bashers are most likely to find little new to love here, despite the fact that this is a distinctly mature step up in his resume. Argue what you want, but it's hard to dismiss his work as not at least entertaining, if not more than occasionally quite absurd. You see ever dollar up on the screen and every shot looks like it was painstakingly produced (which has also been a regular source of ridicule as well as praise). Forget every other film he's made and let's get to this one.<br/><br/>Far more intellectual than what you might expect, don't be surprised if your mind does not occasionally start to dwell on debates of morality and what makes a human being, well, a human being. There are harsh criticisms made about our society and our human nature to the point that you will find yourself demonizing most of the human characters and identifying with the pure, selfless and ideal nature of the protagonists. Our heroes are after all, basically children and therefore have an uncorrupted view of right and wrong, and act on those impulses accordingly. There are some very ugly reminders of what man has been capable in the service of his own selfish objectives, and man's capacity to rationalize the persecution or extermination of other humans and animals as either necessary or because the obstacles are less than human in their eyes. We are quite literally even reminded of the horrors of the Holocaust in a harrowing incinerator scene. We further have our our recall stimulated of another recent act of inhumanity when a major character speaks of a their parents part in resisting the warlords victimizing civilians in Africa. All pretty heavy stuff from the guy who directed the BAD BOY movies. <br/><br/>Now, make no mistake, this is still Bay spectacle stuff here, but even much of that has the unique feeling of real and tangible. The cities seem functionaland one conceivable in the near future. There is not a lot of incomprehensible techno jargon to bombard you either. Even the chases, clearly inspired by other action films themselves (even Bay references himself here) seem fresh and clever. It's worth the ticket price. You get some real inner debate and creepy but intelligent suspense and some genuinely exciting chases in a believable futuristic world. If you take healthy doses of THX-1138, LOGAN'S RUN and a better realization of the B Movie FREEJACK (yeah, there's a bit of that movie in here too) and an obscure flick MST3K fans will recognize called CLONUS then you have a pretty good idea what to expect here, and you know what? It ain't bad at all."
