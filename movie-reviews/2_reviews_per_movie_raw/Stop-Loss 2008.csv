","Well intentioned, this film tells the fictional story of Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe), an American soldier who, after successfully completing a heroic but horrendous tour of duty in Iraq, is notified that, despite his wishes, he must return to Iraq for yet more combat duty, a real-life contingency called ""stop-loss"". It's a fate that neither King, nor real-life soldiers, want or deserve, but which the U.S. government justifies in lieu of a wartime draft.<br/><br/>The film's first few minutes provide a montage of images and scenes showing King, and his men, in Iraq, as they bond together as protective buddies, and as they endure a violent urban ambush, during which several buddies get killed or seriously wounded.<br/><br/>Back home in Texas, King and a couple of his men briefly celebrate their hero status. But life for them quickly deteriorates, as their wartime trauma leaves both physical and mental scars. And then, King gets his ""stop-loss"" notice. This sets up the rest of the film's plot.<br/><br/>The theme here is obvious. The brave soldier, having endured more than enough danger and trauma, is still just a powerless individual. As such, he or she is caught between having to resubmit to the horrors of war, or submit to a perilous and life-altering AWOL status in the U.S., or elsewhere, forever on the run from an overpowering American political system. It's a timely and worthy subject for a film.<br/><br/>That much effort and care went into the creation of the film, from background research to attention to detail in costumes, production design, and military protocol is obvious.<br/><br/>And the film's color cinematography also is quite good. There are lots of close-ups, to get a feel for what the characters are going through. Many scenes feature natural lighting, used in clever ways. At times, the film has an almost documentary look and feel. Acting is overall credible. I especially liked the performances of Linda Emond, as King's mom, and Abbie Cornish, as a young woman who tries to help King.<br/><br/>The major problem is the script. Characters are rather stereotyped and two-dimensional. The plot is fairly predictable. And the story and its attendant theme are a tad too direct. I could have wished for a little more depth, and a plot twist or two. The film's ending is not very satisfying.<br/><br/>Yet, ""Stop-Loss"" is a noble effort to document the brutality not only of war but also of an American government that uses, then basically throws away, people, to ensure the preservation of an American war industry and continued power of faceless bureaucrats and corrupt politicians."
"countvonbarron","Null","203","275","17 August 2008"," Not a balanced portrayal.
","I'm a sergeant in the army and have served 2 tours in Iraq and am preparing to go a third time in December. This film was irresponsible and not balanced in it's portrayal. First off every single soldier has an 8 year commitment. However long your initial enlistment is (3,4 years etc) you then serve the remainder of your time as part of the IRR (indivdual ready reserve). Moreover every single soldier knows about stop loss. It wouldn't have been portrayed the way it was in the movie. He would have known about it ahead of time. They don't tell you the day you get out and make it a surprise. Especially as an E6 a staff sergeant. The combat scene was not realistic. Soldiers guarding a checkpoint WOULD NEVER leave it to chase a vehicle. That is general order no 1 every soldier is taught that from day 1 of basic training. Furthermore the portrayal of PTSD was not wholly accurate. The army has programs in place to treat it. The character played by Joseph Gordon Levitt would not have gotten a bad conduct discharge for breaking a window. He would have received punishment under the uniform code of military justice. For a bad conduct discharge there would have to be a pattern of behavior over a period of time and then every effort would be made to rehabilitate that soldier. The discharge would only come after that had occurred. Finally the scenes of the authorities chasing Ryan Phillipe is BS. The army does not pursue you if you go AWOl. For short awols the soldiers usually receive punishment under UCMJ. For long awols over 30 days the army drops them from the rolls and stops their pay and benefits. If you attempt to get a federal job your name is entered into a database as a deserter. Lastly the final scene is total nonsense. Assuming he was awol less than 30 days he would have been demoted at least 1 grade. He would not have kept his current rank. The soldier was portrayed as a coward. Bottom line. I know personally soldiers in my unit 1 in my squad who have been stop lossed and although they may complain EVERY one of them will do their duty honorably. This movie claims to be pro soldier but it does not portray our soldiers in an honest way and that is dishonoring the memory of all of our soldiers both alive and dead who have served and are still serving over there. Also in response to adx2-1's comment he is right about the policy. 90 days before deployment and 90 days after the unit returns to home station. And under the current dwell time policy it would have been at least a year before he returned. Although it is never stated how long it is suggested that it is less than a year."
"paul2001sw-1","7","7","7","12 June 2011"," Stops short of being great; but still worth seeing
","'Stop-Loss' deals with the problems soldiers have in getting out of the army; both through the technical procedure of ""Stop-Loss"", whereby a solider is sent back for a second consecutive tour of duty, but also through the difficulties of adjusting to civilian life after time on the front line. Many dramas set after the Vietnam war explored the idea that the sense of a victory well won (absent then, as now) might be critical to enabling a soldier to make the transition from combat animal back to member of civic society. The film is well made, powerfully acted, and doesn't pretend that it's characters are angels (although it justly acknowledges their bravery). But it doesn't really go very far beyond its premise, and the ending is given a slightly more upbeat (but inconclusive) spin than could have been applied. The final credits remind us of the startling high number of American troops to have fought in Afghanistan or Iraq in the 21st century; wars that are fought (for good or bad) while the rest of us get on with our lives in an altogether easier place."
"adx2-1","6","26","34","13 April 2008"," Okay, but...
","When I saw the preview, I thought it would be an accurate portrayal on how stop-loss affects soldiers. Unfortunately, it was a little off the wall in how it showed Brandon getting stop-lossed. In reality, stop-loss takes place 90 days prior to deployment and stays in effect until 90 days after the soldier returns. Each unit is given one year of ""dwell time"" in the US, which means they won't deploy during that period. The film's portrayal of Brandon getting stop-lossed only a week after he returned from Iraq to go to Iraq again for another tour a few weeks later was as realistic as shooting 100 rounds from an M4 without changing the magazine once. Also, with his actions after he was stop-lossed (saying f*** the President, going AWOL, etc...) he wouldn't have just went back to Iraq still a Staff Sergeant like he did at the end of the movie. He probably would have gotten a court-martial instead.<br/><br/>Other than those things, it isn't a bad movie. Just inaccurate. I served three tours in Iraq already and I was stop-lossed for my second one. I knew I was stop-lossed over three months before I left, they didn't wait until two weeks before it was time to go to tell me I was stop-lossed. I made the decision to reenlist later on instead of getting out at the end of my second tour."
"phantomtristan","7","81","126","30 March 2008"," I'm getting out!
","Director Kimberly Peirce (""Boys Don't Cry"") brings another powerfully charged film of such raw emotion that upon later reflection of the movie I felt like I had witnessed real events.<br/><br/>Stop-Loss follows the fictional story of a soldier, Brandon King (Ryan Philippe), who has returned home after a tour in Iraq. His contract is up and he just about to get out when he is stop-lossed (a ""fine-print"" section in all soldiers' contracts that gives the President the power to extended soldier's contracts in time of war). He refuses to be shipped back to Iraq, and goes AWOL in search of his state's senator for help. What follows is his road trip to fight the stop-loss as well as showing the devastating affects his fellow soldiers (Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt) experience from the horrible war. Its' acting, directing, and writing had such a feeling of authenticity, and combined with the fact that 81,000 of our brave soldiers have already been stop-lossed since Spetember 11,2001, this film feels like a true story.<br/><br/>One thing that made this film succeed so well was it's director was a woman, and she was able to make a movie were you could feel and see the emotions these guys were feeling even as they would desperately try and mask them.<br/><br/>The acting was extraordinary from the three main soldiers, most notably Ryan Philippe who is so gritty and real in his performance that he seems like he actually is a marine. Channing Tatum gives a genuine performance, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt's is the most haunting of the trio as a soldier who fights his Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with excessive amounts of booze and slowly slips into a deep hole of despair.<br/><br/>This films is not a propaganda piece, it simply portrays something that is going on right now. It brings up many good points, but never bashes you with a certain viewpoint but leaves it to you to decide. This is such emotionally powerful, deeply moving film, the best film I have seen since the year started, and destined to be one of my favorites from this year."

","It's horrible that we need a new one, you'd think people would learn their lesson the first, or hundredth, time they were taught it. But anyway, the movie is pretty good. At the very beginning it reminded me of 'Redacted' and then later 'In the Valley of Elah' and you could say with most movies that that would be a detriment but they're all telling stories about the same subject. So it's not like anyone is copying anyone else.<br/><br/>This movie is more movie-ish than those I mentioned. It works as entertainment(that sounds wrong) as well as being informative. It's showing you a certain situation people are going through but it's also a ""movie"", with action scenes, good acting, relationship issues, etc. As I said the acting is good. Ryan Phillipe is I want to say underrated, but maybe he's not rated at all. He's an extremely good looking person who could have just been in romantic comedies and made some nice money that way, but instead he's carved out an interesting resume for himself. He does some of his best work here. Joseph Gordon Levitt, everyone's favorite young indie actor, shows up here as well, although he has a smaller role than he normally does. He and the rest of the cast were also really good. Ciaran Hinds makes an interesting cowboy, btw. I wouldn't have guessed that. The only problem I may have had with the film is that I didn't like the ending. But that doesn't take away from the fact that I think this is a well-made movie.<br/><br/>The film is serious. It'll probably be depressing for most people. But hey life is depressing right now. Especially for people involved in this situation and maybe those folks should consider whether they should really watch it or not. Because I would think they'd want to escape that reality. The people who aren't paying attention to what's going on should see it. I'd have less problem recommending this to them. I think it's the least likely of the Iraq based movies to offend anyone. It's got a few violent war scenes but nothing over-the-top or terribly graphic. It's just basically wave at you saying ""hel-lo, this is the stuff you're trying to ignore but should really be paying attention to.' There is a normal amount of cursing and no naked people that I can remember.<br/><br/>If you haven't been watching the Iraq war centered movies, it's time you saw one and this would probably be the easiest to take."

","i thought that this was a very compelling movie.. lot's of good character development, ryan phillipe was great in this, he really knocked it out of the park with this one, he plays a staff seargeant who comes home a ""hero"" from Iraq, there is a parade , the whole town comes out , the senator is there and tells him anything you need son, come look me up. so him and his buddies spend a few days at home over the weekend catching up with their wives girlfriends,, and what not, things get rowdy and lot's of drinking happens, usual stuff. so on Monday morning our hero goes back to the office to get his official discharge papers,, well to his chagrin, he is sent back to iraq for another tour of duty, this little known ""trick"" in the military is in the fine print,, basically it says , the president can extened you're military term in time of war.. well in this particular case the war was already declared over years ago,, there you can see our hero's dilemma should he suck it up and go back or fight the system. he decides to fight the system going AWOL.. that's absent without leave.. first he tries canada then d.c. then Mexico.. and were not to the end yet. very compelling movie, it's grips you to the core, and makes you wanna get up and do something about getting our boys back in one piece from Iraq which we have no business being there in the first place."
"E Canuck","8","67","109","27 March 2008"," A ""Deer Hunter"" for the Iraq War
","Just saw this film in an advance screening and once the tension and threat (very real) of the opening battle scenes were borne and past, the film grew on me, as the story became one of the soldiers at home: their war aftermath and their war that just won't quit or let them go.<br/><br/>It occurred to me at one point this was quite like watching a ""Deer Hunter"" for the Iraq war. There were certainly similar aspects, including aspects of the soldiers' relationships with each other and with others at home, and in terms of the casualties and injuries that continue to pile up well after leaving the battlefield.<br/><br/>Stop Loss is perhaps a more political film than the ""Deer Hunter"" was, because of the timing of its release, while the issues of the war in the film are still very much on the boil in the USA. I think it intends to position itself in a relevant and timely place, and time will tell whether it has staying power as a lasting and powerful war or antiwar film.<br/><br/>There is enough humanity, good drama and strong acting in this picture that it may deserve a place in the lineup of memorable or important American war films."
"Erico_77375","10","136","241","13 March 2008"," Stop-Loss Is Not Anti-War, It's Pro-Soldier
","What is bravery? Is it trying to do the right thing while facing death in the process? What is patriotism? Is it selflessly giving to your country your services and possibly your life to protect and idea? What is honor? Is it following through on your responsibilities to others who depend on you? In today's United States Army, these questions aren't merely hypothetical, but the basis of character. Kimberly Pierce understood this when she made her sophomore film Stop-Loss, which is extremely likely to be my favorite film of 2008.<br/><br/>Stop-Loss tells the story of a group of soldiers from Texas who are coming home from Iraq. Just before they see stateside, they encounter an ambush that kills three of their respected brothers. The squad leader Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) feels responsible for the deaths. He intends to leave the service for good when he gets back along with his best friend (Channing Tatum). This is good news to Brandon's family; his father (the great Cirian Hinds) was a vet from Vietnam. This is also good news for his friend's fiancé (Abbie Cornish), whose love only shadows her loneliness.<br/><br/>But when Brandon turns in his gear and paperwork, he is told that he's to ship back out to Iraq on a stop-loss, which he instantly contests with his superior (Timothy Olyphant). The result has Brandon on the run as he goes AWOL to find a way out of going. He is aided by his friend's fiancé; he decides his best chance is to convince a local senator in Washington to help him. Along the way, he gets a tour of conscience. He meets the family of one of his dead men, whose brother knows about people who could get soldiers through to Canada. He also goes to see another of his comrades (Victor Russak), who was severely wounded in the conflict. And at the end, Brandon must make one of the hardest decisions that anyone will ever have to face.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, this film has be one of the most unusual films dealing with war. It neither sides for the conflict in Iraq or against it, finding the argument to be beside the point. No doubt that Brandon does say something unflattering about his Commander-in-Chief in one scene, but the film makes it's bravest decision in being pro-soldier from beginning to end. We like these guys, we honor their dedication to our country and we only want them to find happiness and safety back home. But we can tell nearly from the start that coming home isn't going to be easy when tensions flare up in unpredictable ways. One of the men (played flawlessly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) seems to need violence in order to feel normal. The film doesn't hate him for it, nor do we since we know that, in the words of another great movie, he had ""a bad war"".<br/><br/>There is something to be said about the decisions made in this film. In lesser movies, Brandon's decision would be more clear-cut depending on the filmmaker's political views. There would be some who call Brandon's plight cowardice and the film addresses this by allowing Brandon to have more than a couple of emotions. He's not afraid to fight or to die, but has a more interesting reason to resist. And the film doesn't see any easy answer in the options left to him. We see the life of another AWOL soldier up-close. There's nothing pretty about that.<br/><br/>A lot of the success of the film has to go to the amazing casting of the film. I have never been much of a fan for Ryan Phillippe), but he might have just converted me. This is an amazing performance of such complexity and earnestness that I was left truly amazed. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been a rising independent superstar, completely washing away his child actor days in films that are challenging, playing parts that require his brand of smooth ferocity. This character is important even though he does little for the plot by being a tragic figure. I believe he might see his first nomination for this role. But my favorite performance may also be the most worthy of the Oscar this year: Abbie Cornish. Cornish isn't just throwing diamonds as a young woman in love with an impossible man. <br/><br/>Stop-Loss might just be the best military film since Platoon that deals with soldiers as individuals and not part of a strategy board. Kimberly Pierce, whose first and only other film was Boys Don't Cry, sees soldiers in a way that other filmmakers haven't (and those filmmakers are almost exclusively male, a few veterans themselves). She declares that she had documented hundreds of interviews with soldiers. This is one of the extremely rare cases that fiction proves to be the better format over documentary. In making this a fictional tale, she can tell a broader story and accompany the emotional journey of all her characters. She did this with her first film, which told the sad story of Brandon Teena. I didn't think that she could have made a better film than that. She has proved that she could and has.<br/><br/>All in all, I love this film and cannot recommend this to enough people. It's going to be attacked unfairly by the pro-war crowd who either feel that the film encourages wrong behaviors or weakening morale. In fact, I think that the film shows the real indomitable spirit of the fighting men with honor. But I also find that those who attack movies like these usually think that the best way to support the troops is to keep them in harms way. Stop-Loss isn't a cry to ""cut and run"". It's a testament that soldiers will remain honorable no matter how they come home. Something that John McCain might keep in mind"
"alexbq2","Null","73","124","16 November 2007"," A Great Film! Too bad that this story is the reality for a lot of people.
","I had an opportunity to attend an advanced screening of this film yesterday in Boulder CO. I am not in any way affiliated with film industry or the critique. I was just a lucky walk in.<br/><br/>I've seen a preview of this movie a few days before and was not impressed by the trailer. It looked like another belated anti-war movie (better late then never), with youthful actors looking ruggedly pretty for the camera.<br/><br/>What I saw was a fist full of reality mixed with a great story of, I guess, a youth becoming a man  not in a sexual way.<br/><br/>The plot is obvious from the trailer, so there is nothing I can give away. The ending was not surprising, at least to me. And the ending was both obvious and powerful.<br/><br/>The beginning is very life like. If you've seen Gunner Palace, or been to this war, you'll recognize it. It starts in a format of home movies made by soldiers who serve in Iraq. It was apparently based on the films and photographs shot by actual soldiers. Some of this footage was included into these opening sequences, much was recreated by the actors. So it is ultra realistic. The only way to tell them apart is to look for Ryan Philippe, who is good in his role but stands out due to being easily recognizable.<br/><br/>The film quickly moves into a war sequence, demonstrating the horrors of war. Do not expect to see the charge of the light brigade. It is not a massive battle, but you will see the bullets flying, and more importantly killing. If you were put off by the violence in Saving Private Ryan, you may want to close your eyes for a few minutes at this point. Past the gun battle we are back in the States. So the Iraq part is only about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The real story kicks in when Ryan Philippe with his war buddies returns home a decorated war hero looking forward to put the past behind him only to find out that his contract was extended by the Stop Loss policy and he is to go back to Iraq. The film does not become boring or preachy. And through the main character's journey both we and he realize that he has very few options: go to jail, abandon (physically) the country and everything he is and has, or go back to war. What choice can he make? So what was my point about the ""becoming a man"" story? Well, the way I see it, the main character's final decision, is not just forced on him. It springs not from fear or just inevitability, but from his sense of responsibility towards his parents and friends  I'm not going to say 'country', this has nothing to do with flag waving patriotism. His accepting to go back, is an act of an adult. He accepts all the horror, the risk, the BS, the unfairness. He does it through a conscious decision. The decision is to take care of those who depend on him. That sounds pretty grown up to me.<br/><br/>Thanks go out to Kimberly Peirce, who wrote and directed this film. And directly in front of whom I was sitting quietly last night while she was presenting her movie.<br/><br/>You also may want to check out Harsh Times, Gunner Palace and The Execution of Private Slovik."
"Ric-7","7","28","44","8 April 2008"," Wish It Could Have Been Better
","Maybe the idea was to show the total hopelessness of the conflict--that it was not really a war but urban warfare, and that there is no way to win or to have a happy ending. But that's just an idea--it's not a movie.<br/><br/>I thought that the set-up was fine. But I am not sure the filmmakers knew where to go with it. Their take on the stop-loss policy is obvious, and it is a message that should be heard. But I think the film would have been more interesting if any character exhibited any real growth during the film. The vets were all depicted as basket cases--the most well-adjusted vet seemed to be the double-amputee--he told us why he would want to go back to Iraq and there was at least some productive purpose that would have been served by his return there.<br/><br/>Perhaps there are soldiers who don't mind being stop-lossed--who truly believe they are accomplishing something positive over there. It would have been refreshing to have a character like that--a non-basket case. It would have been good to hear arguments supporting the stop-loss program (if there are any).<br/><br/>The last 20-30 minutes of this film were baffling. The end of the film (not an ending, just an end) was very unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Ryan Philippe did a competent job, but rarely conveyed anything not apparent from the lines or situation. For example, you could see that a lot of his post-war angst was attributable to guilt. How that tied in with the ending is just a mystery to me.<br/><br/>I recall that a very similar military policy was explored by Joseph Heller in Catch-22. I think a comparison to that novel and film is more apt than comparing this to The Deer Hunter.<br/><br/>I wish this film could have been much better than it was."
"ffrudderiii","2","6","7","19 September 2008"," Good initiative, Poor execution
","It is unfortunate that between this film, In the Valley of Elah, Lions for Lambs, and Home of the Brave seem to all be based upon common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The boozing, the fighting, the short-fuses, the broken marriages, guys freaking out and digging a foxhole in their front yard when they're drunk, etc etc etc.<br/><br/>Does it happen - yes, but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies. I think that it is unfortunate that these directors/producers/writers choose to grind their axe against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way. In this particular film, Kimberly Peirce didn't even throw us a bone, like showing the new children that were born while a family member was deployed, or the kid who grew up in some ghetto who can now afford college thanks to the GI Bill, or the couple who can afford a house, or start a new business, earn their citizenship, etc etc etc. Instead, we are treated to the stereotypes because the people who made this film only want to show you the bad side.<br/><br/>A couple of issues with the film itself: 1) somebody screwed up by putting Phillippe in for a Bronze Star with V after he led his squad down a tight alleyway after having been baited by a gunman in a taxi. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) the humvees didn't have any turret armor, so we are supposed to believe it is a near the beginning of the war, yet every soldier and their brother has an ACOG and every possible attachment for their M4? sorry, don't think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as a Lieutenant Colonel? It's hard to believe, but I just checked an he turned 40 in May, so the timing isn't too off. 4) He strikes two soldiers to escape being sent to jail after saying that he wouldn't return to Iraq (upon having learned that he had been stop-lossed). So he's a fugitive. Then, when he finally turns himself in at the end, and they take him back, he keeps his rank and deploys with the same unit? Sorry don't think so.<br/><br/>I can only describe it as one giant stereotype of the Army and the Infantry. Do some of the events portrayed in this movie happen to some soldiers, yes. However, in this film you get practically every stereotype in the space of about 100 minutes, and really things just aren't like that for most soldiers returning. I wish the director had made a point of doing a little better research instead of starting off with her agenda and then making a film.<br/><br/>Of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best one is probably Lions for Lambs, which is more a commentary on the sad state of Generation Y+ than it is about the Wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush Administration. If you really want to see this film wait for cable or Netflix it, don't pay cash directly to rent it."

","Kimberly Peirce becomes one of the latest directors to try and only marginally succeed in making a compelling film about the Iraq conflict.<br/><br/>Peirce takes on as her subject the military's stop-loss clause, essentially a back door draft by which the military can use fine print in recruits' contracts to prevent them from getting out once their time is up. Peirce obviously feels strongly about the policy, but what should be a hard-hitting drama feels instead like a rather preachy after-school special. She coaxes a nice performance out of Ryan Phillipe, as the soldier who goes AWOL when his stop-loss clause is activated, but she doesn't fare as well with the rest of the cast. The film suffers from confusing editing, that doesn't always make it clear where characters are or how events are related to one another, and the writing at times is weak as well, with character motivations not coming across as clearly as they should.<br/><br/>I don't know what it is about the Iraq conflict that makes it so hard for filmmakers to make good movies about it.

","My mistake for thinking this was a serious war-is-hell movie prior to seeing it. That all ended seconds into the film when the ""MTV"" logo appeared. It might as well been called ""National Lampoon's Sexy-N-Loose."" And it did play to the ""MTV"" crowd; the movie that followed those comical first few seconds played like the music videos they used to play 40+ years ago. At least Disney was smart enough to ship its Rated R stuff over to Touchtone and allowed us to take it seriously. Okay, I'm being harsh; it wasn't that bad of a film. However, it definitely has its share of overacting and the film is extremely biased/one-sided. Admittedly, I'm not a war movie buff. I can't watch 'Platoon,' 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'Saving Private Ryan' more than once. Sure they were good movies, but they're not my forte and they all seem to blend in after awhile to where I wouldn't be able to distinguish one from the next. Following a tour in Iraq, Phillippe plans life after the war but is drawn back in due to a clause in his contract. Or, at least, that's the military's plan until he goes AWOL and the characters speed cross-country on a few bucks amazingly never caught. No, I haven't been in any war, nor to Iraq, nor do I agree with it. I also don't have all the knowledge when it comes to recruitment or signing their contracts. I can say this: though I am sorry they're drawn back into this conflict, I can't feel too much for someone so dumb not to read the fine print. It's like someone on their deathbed leaning over to finally read the Surgeon General's warning on their box of cigarettes and say, ""Oh, they're what? Deadly? I'll sue them!"""
"XFilesRocks","Null","20","34","13 July 2008"," Insightful movie about loss and dealing with ones own fragile existence in Iraq
","I really liked this movie. I wasn't looking for a bloody battle scene and there wasn't much of that expressed. Most of what was conveyed was the loss of friends in a situation that could happen to soldiers who march into harms way. Then the soldiers return home, back to the way things were? Their lives are not the same, and the people at home can't understand because they weren't there to see a friend die in their arms at the hands of some terrorist killers.<br/><br/>My brother just retired from the Army. He volunteered in Iraq for 1 year. He safely returned home, but his life had changed from that moment he was in Iraq. He said they lost a few young men, and another returned home severely burned from a cocktail thrown into the vehicle. At 130 degrees, how can they keep the windows closed in a military vehicle with the engine off. Two men that died were young (18 and 20). I feel the young soldiers have not received enough training and are too young to deal with the stress of war. <br/><br/>The movie had me thinking about the young men and women that barely have a year of training and next have RPGs hurling at them, roadside bombs, suicidal bombers walking into streets. How can anyone be trained to deal with that and be aware of it before it happens?<br/><br/>I commend the different positions on war in this movie: 1) Soldiers who are willing to die for their families and country. 2) Soldiers who have served their country and feel they should have the choice to step down from their jobs.<br/><br/>Stop-loss was something I never heard of until I saw the movie. How on earth can we say in the United States we have FREEDOM to choose if that privilege is removed when you enlist? It is like when you quit a job, move to another state, join a religion. FREEDOM to Choose! The Stop-Loss sanction nullifies the FREEDOM to step down after serving your country for 1 term or more. Do they think that will encourage people to sign up to serve in the armed forces if the contract removes their basic right of FREEDOM that we all hold so dearly. I was angry to hear soldiers are forced to return to serve multiple times. Many soldiers clearly need to stay home to recover and try to live a normal life instead of sending them back to die. It sounds as if these soldiers are no more than a body with a gun to send back into war.<br/><br/>I would recommend seeing this movie!"
"penandpaper52","5","64","136","25 February 2008"," Sadly one sided...
","Caught this at the Canadian premier... Phillippe was there answering questions with the director and I was looking forward to something a lot more powerful than what I saw. The issue that it brought to light was definitely relevant, thought provoking, and powerful all on its own. The film, however, offered nothing new in the way of characters--meaning, we've seen this type of character in many other films, and they were often handled much better--and the story didn't really keep me entranced. Why? Because, the main issue, stop loss, was handled in a very one sided manner. The Q&A suggested that the director--and some in the audience--thought the issue really was played out in an open ended way, but really, it was just a bunch of policy bashing. Frankly, I agree with the films point of view, I just feel it loses all of it's meaning in how it was presented. Perhaps the cliché nature of so much of the confrontations hurt it for me as well. I didn't care about the life the characters were to leave behind, etc, etc...<br/><br/>Saying all of this, the performances were good for the parts. Some of the dialogue was exceptional (some... it had its moments) and the scenes that actually took place in the war were astounding. <br/><br/>On a last thought, the director made a point of explaining that a lot of the inspiration came from the fact that many soldiers these days video and photograph every aspect of their lives, and edit them together with music and share them with the world--cameras mounted on their cars, guns, etc---and so much of the war footage was displayed this way. Frankly, I was upset more of the film didn't take its inpiration from the same styling."
"moutonbear25","7","26","51","5 April 2008"," A Lost Stop
","A bunch of American army boys waste away their time at camp, horsing around and yelling obscenities at each other while they wait their next posting. The style is gritty and raw. There are no Hollywood glamour shots of pretty boy stars, Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum or Joseph Gordon-Levitt; there is just confusion over where their day is headed. Before long, the team is manning a road blockade. Director Kimberly Pierce keeps the framing and the editing tight in this opening sequence and shoots the intensity high into the clear-blue, Iraq sky. Each car that approaches the young, scattered soldiers could be a disaster. One second they're lusting over a girl back home, the next they find themselves in the middle of a full- on ambush. The lot of them all fall into line and show what good soldiers are made of  boys that become men in a moment's notice without thinking. And then they fight. Moves are made in as calculated a fashion as is allowed in the back alleys of a foreign land. Some of the men live and some die fighting. Within minutes, STOP-LOSS has you and then without warning, the film suddenly turns into a hip-hop musical montage, establishing the stop- and-start pulse of the film that ultimately leaves it for a loss.<br/><br/>It has been nearly ten years since Pierce made her fearless directorial debut with BOYS DON'T CRY. It was a commanding assault on the viewer's nerves with each scene building panic and mounting anxiety. You were never given a chance to breathe and the tragic story it told became unforgettable as a result. This is why it is all so strange to see her impose breaks upon the viewer. Not only does it grind the flow to a halt in the dirt but it also exposes the need to repackage the current wave of Iraq war themed films. On the one hand, it makes some sense to cut the film together in an MTV-inspired style to market the war to the generation that is actually fighting it (it should also be noted that the film is MTV produced). On the other hand though, this approach subsequently comes across as a compromised version of Pierce's potential vision. That said, perhaps the new design is necessary in order to get the film's important message across and heard.<br/><br/>The message in this latest condemnation of the Iraq war effort is to bring attention to the ""stop-loss"" process. The term itself refers to the army's right to force soldiers into another tour of duty at the end of the term they voluntarily signed up for. It is only supposed to be invoked when the war is still ongoing so you can imagine the outrage felt by Brandon King (Phillippe) as he is expecting to be signing his discharge papers and is told instead that he is shipping back to Iraq. Infuriated by his government's backdoor approach to get around the lack of a draft, Brandon goes AWOL in search of a way out. While taking advantage of the soldiers that enlisted freely to fight for their country is appalling enough, it becomes even more so when you see how messed up the returning soldiers have become after balancing being boys and being men in such devastating situations. Pierce's subtle presentation of the young men of Middle America is smart enough not to exaggerate their psychological damage but their table manners speak volumes to make her point. These are men who cannot carry on a conversation without recounting atrocious experiences they suffered through and have no concept of how uncomfortable they are making everyone around them. Another tour of duty could reasonably crush them if it doesn't kill them. With that in mind, Brandon's escape is not just warranted but imperative.<br/><br/>At one point, Brandon makes a homecoming speech to the people of his Texas town. Midway, he is overwhelmed by how much he has been affected by the simple sights and smells of his home and he cannot go on. Everything he was fighting for becomes clear to him but a fellow officer interrupts his speech in favor of a more crowd-rousing message. People don't want to face the reality of the war; they just want to hear that their side is winning. And while Pierce's point is important and still firmly made, it is impossible to feel as if this film that took so many years to make is actually the film she intended and not a film that was designed to profit from a specific market. Still, it is worth applauding for providing a product that will be most enjoyed and appreciated by the demographic that is actually fighting on the front lines as opposed to an older generation that until now has been able to just sit back in the theatre and quietly criticize the war from afar."
"mjpetrario","2","4","5","17 July 2013"," Utterly inaccurate and chaotic.
","The main problem I have with this film and many others at that, is the lack of research and/or military advisor's. It is almost as if the writers, producers, etc guessed the entire time during the making of it. Hollywood as a whole rarely, if ever, gets military uniforms right or close to it so I can't complain about that. Also in the film, we have chaotic firefights that include insane amounts of RPG's blowing things up at point blank range and the first .50 caliber machine gun ever that can't shoot through anything...at all. ""Stop-Loss"" also continues the Hollywood tradition of reloading a weapon once or twice, if ever. Stop-Loss in real life was/is much more common in active duty soldiers than it is National Guard. So I'm also left kind of confused as to why they used the NG plot. The storyline is pretty boring, there is an overage of cheesy military slang that nobody has used since the late 80's/early 90's. All military flaws aside, I personally flat out don't like this movie as a whole. It's right down there at the bottom of the barrel with ""Home of the Brave"" with 50 Cent and Samuel L. Jackson, and ""Hurt Locker"", (where apparently there's no rules for an EOD guy and he's a Ranger?). I believe that the personnel involved in the writing, producing, directing of this film, Stop-Loss had the best intentions to shed light on the epidemic that is Stop-Loss. However, this film is a travesty to anyone who, like myself, has experienced the Stop-Loss policy during OIF and OEF. Kimberly Pierce, Mark Richards, Greg Goodman, and Scott Rudin should ""Stop"" making stupid cheesy movies before they take another box office ""Loss""."
"DarknessNamed","7","6","9","31 March 2008"," Stopped in it's tracks....
","Stop-Loss, produced by MTV Films and directed by Kimberly Peirce brings us a new a movie part of a small genre of military films that have popped up, not to glorify the horrors of war but to look at a different aspect of the soldier's psyche. In this case we are introduced to Ryan Phillipe's character who has experienced immense amounts of violence, blood, and sadness during his tour in Iraq and the numerous missions he took part in. His plans to disembark from the Army are halted when he is ""stop-lossed"" by the U.S. government and is re-enlisted against his will, prompting him to go on a journey to Washington to seek help from his senator whom he feels can help him get out of this situation. Performances all around were well done, and they help to make up for the major issues I have with this film. Ryan Phillipe and Joseph-Gordon Levitt stand out among the cast and help to keep the story from becoming dull or slow-moving. Now to the real issues, setting aside that Ryan Phillipe goes from Texas to Tennessee, to New York City, all on a tank of gas AND a motorcycle, there are glaring issues that need to be addressed about his character. He sells his car for $1000, using that money towards a set of Canadian identification, yet moments later he is standing on the Mexican border ready to walk across it. If Ryan Phillipe was so dead-set on going out of the country, why didn't he just use the Canadian papers that he had sold his car for, and dropped in $1000 for? Did he just go to Mexico because it was convenient, after he rode to Texas in a DAY for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's funeral on his new motorcycle? And why does he decide to go back to the Army after all? We see no sign of emotion on his face when he is sitting on the bus, was it all just a dream? You would think that a person who goes AWOL, which by the way is a very serious offense, would have a little more signs of resistance or emotion in their eyes when they are sitting on the bus of the thing which they swore minutes earlier was wrong and was something that they would never return to. Channing Tatum was also told to bring Phillipe in, in 14 hours or else Phillipe would face federal charges, Tatum fails to do this, yet Phillipe is SITTING ON THE BUS IN THE END OF THE MOVIE AS IF NOTHING IN THE MOVIE EVER HAPPENED. No charges filed? No demotion was in order? Nothing? This movie would have been a lot better if he had just shut up, and gone to Mexico, the ending is a clear discontinuity in terms of the characters and the emotions of the whole movie."
"sf_knight","3","17","33","10 March 2008"," A Narrative Trainwreck of Good Intentions
","As a big fan of Kimberly Peirce's ""Boys Don't Cry,"" I went to a sneak preview of ""Stop-Loss"" with positive expectations. However, despite its good intentions, this film is a muddled mess. It cobbles together a narrative that feels false and arbitrary given the particular group of soldiers the story focuses on. A group of lifelong friends from a small Texas town (which is itself portrayed in about as clichéd as an outsider's imagination of a Texas small-town could be) come back and all suffer shell-shock and trauma, as one might expect. However, Ryan Phillippe's character, expecting to be finished with his duty, reacts to the news that he is being ""Stop-Lossed"" (sent back on another tour of duty) by instantly breaking from every fiber of his upbringing. In about 90 seconds, he is a different man, rebellious, ready to run. Soon he is picking fights and wobbling dangerously close to uncontrollable Rambo territory even as we are supposed to believe that he has an unassailably correct belief that he shouldn't be forced to go back no matter what the military says. Unfortunately Phillippe (who had seemed to be becoming a better actor in 2007's ""Breach"") tips his hand here and reveals his limited range (not to mention a horrifically fake sounding Texas twang). Phillippe's equally unbalanced yet more ra-ra lifelong bud is played with an even more limited range of emotions by former (though-should-probably-have-stayed-a) model Channing Tatum, who admittedly does have the good sense to avoid even attempting a Southern accent here. Even poor Joseph Gordon Levitt, who has proved himself an able and promising young actor in several recent films), is reduced to seeming tinny and unconvincing here.<br/><br/>The paper-thin story sends Phillippe uselessly careening across the U.S. accompanied by his best friend's fiancée, an unconvincing device that accomplishes little. There are also lots of badly executed sequences of these fugitives driving and hiding, not to mention loads of clunky, repetitive dialogue that never gets us to the soul of these men who are supposedly suffering. In an example of unbridled directorial excess, the story even gets broken up several times by jarring, wholly unnecessary 'soldier videos' that supposedly mimic those created by the boots on the ground, but which look more professional than many music videos today and feel really inauthentic. Plus, they yank us out of the story again and again, and after awhile, it's hard to go back into it.<br/><br/>The ending is doubly unsatisfying in that, after forcing these characters to do fairly extreme things that their real-life counterparts would not do, and after making it very clear that we are supposed to be viewing Phillippe as the beleaguered hero on a quest to right a wrong no matter what the consequences, the movie turns on its heels and abandons all that in a flash. The characters and the movie end up where they started, and the audience, who has been shoe-horned into viewing Phillippe's rebellion and journey as something to root for, are abandoned. The director has forced us to slog along on this narrative road for two hours, and as an emotional viewing experience, the ending (even if it is supposed to say something about the inassailability of the military machine) pulls the trap door on us.<br/><br/>The director was present at a Q&A after the film, and she spoke about how she created these characters after talking to a lot of different real-life soldiers back from Iraq & Afghanistan. The film really feels like that -- and not in a good way. It is a patchwork of observations about the shell-shock of returning home without any real commitment to one set of lives. Peirce's ""soldiers"" are overstuffed amalgams who drink and yell and fight and shoot and even cry, but don't breathe."
"badajoz-1","6","2","2","5 February 2010"," A solid attempt at seeing both sides
","This film is never going to make money in the USA because all films and politicians have to make Amnericans feel good about themselves. This leaves one with the queasy feeling that not all is well - the US might not be doing the best thing by the Iraqis, after all whose country is it? Who invaded whom? And under what pretext? But the film is in favour of all those guys fighting on the ground, but they may be fighting the wrong war in the wrong place - and to conservative US that is not acceptable. So this film divides opinion. 'Hurt Locker' of course portrays US heroes so is going to be far more acceptable. The film has a fifties/forties feel in that a decent man makes one mistake, and becomes a fugitive. Montgomery Clift would have made this then. The film portrays a good man caught by duty and his own feelings of justice - a classic theme - well played by Ryan Phillippe, who does manage to show a good range of emotions, and who doesn't get the comfort of getting the girl into the sack - that was left for real life! The script shows the strain of loyalties and the effects of killing in a war that the West brought down upon a largely civilian population - sounds like Concord and 1776 to me! The supports act well and do not drown out the main action and character. But the film has a problem in that the spur for the action is played down too much - eg Brandon King refusing to be 'stop lossed' - and it does not want to make events too dramatic (something the more visceral 'Hurt Locker' engages). Therefore, the film tends to meander as it tries to be too understated. But it does get in several wry observations about an immigrant army, a creepy, smiling officer class, and promise all politicians. A good effort, but ultimately it gets caught between too many stools. A pity because the acting deserved more recognition than being tarred by the rabid, blind patriotism of Americans who see an anti-war and anti-US film!"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","14","27","3 April 2008"," A little heavy handed
","I didn't really know what to expect from Stop Loss, it was just playing at the theater that I worked at and I figured I would go ahead and check it out. So I saw it last night and I have to say that this was seriously one of the most depressing movies of 2008. I went away from this movie just feeling so sad and extremely low, which threw me off on the film. I'm not a supporter of the war in Iraq, I do have 2 cousins and a few friends who are fighting this war and I hate it, so seeing this movie just reminded me even more of that hatred I have. See, the thing is, is that this movie is a reminder to most people why war is Hell and also why they hate what's going on. While I appreciated Kimberly's message to us and reminds us of the pain these soldiers are going through, the story just remains in a biased plot of the constant battle against terrorism.<br/><br/>Brandon has just come home from Iraq and is just enjoying his Texas life with his best friend, Steve, and his other friends. They're drinking, flirting, and partying. But the war has ultimately gotten to them, they're hallucinating, hitting their wives, and are just going crazy. When Brandon is called for Stop-Loss, where he has to go back to Iraq when he was supposed to stay home, he understandably gets angry and runs for it. He tries to head for the border, but realizes that maybe his team needs him.<br/><br/>Stop Loss is a decent movie and it does have a very powerful message, while I always agree that a war movie is going to be very deep, I think this movie went a little further and could have been lighter, but that's just my opinion, I would have done the story a little different. I also understand Kimberly's message, she meant well with this movie, I think it doesn't work as well as her movie, Boys Don't Cry, but Stop Loss is definitely worth a watch. Ryan Phillipe is becoming a fine actor and holds the film very well, Channing Tatum does alright, enough to keep the film going. The story is a little much, but I think this is one movie you're going to have to judge for yourself.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Stop-Loss (2008) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Hard hitting, Anti-Iraq film has Ryan Phillippe playing a U.S. soldier who leaves his final mission in Iraq but soon learns he's been stop-lossed, which means the government can break your original contract and send you back to Iraq. Phillippe refuses to go back so he goes AWOL and hits the road with his best friend's girl (Abbie Cornish) while trying to figure out what to do. Over the past few years there have been countless films protesting the Iraq war and all of them have been fair (Lions for Lambs) to really poor (Redacted) but this one here is clearly the best of the bunch but it's also one of the best war movies out there and clearly one of the best of 2008. The movie has a strong stance against the war but it's certainly Pro-Soldier and the film bleeds with love for the young men putting their lives on the line each day. The film opens with a scene in Iraq where the soldiers are working a checkpoint when a group of thugs show up with guns a soon a big battle breaks out and leads to tragedy. I really enjoyed what director Peirce did here by instead of focusing on the violence she clearly wants the viewer to see that these are kids doing this fighting. She makes it clear to us that it's kids doing the shooting and being shot at, which is something people and the media seems to forget. The Anti-Iraq stuff is handled very well and never becomes too preachy unlike many other recent films. I think the film's one problem is that it really should have ran at least an hour longer because the movie not only looks at Phillippe's situation but also two of his friends who are dealing with their own battles on returning home. The film is a lot like The Deer Hunter, a film that took three hours to tell its story, and I think that long running time would have worked well here. The two friends play a major part in the story and an emotional one so I think their stories could have been pushed out a bit further. The performances in the film are all rather remarkable and this is certainly the greatest work I've seen from Phillippe. I don't want to ruin anything but he has to go through all sorts of mental pain in the film and he pulls this off wonderfully well. I think Phillippe has always been a good actor but this film here pushes him to a great one. He really does give a strong, raw and highly emotional performance, which is the heart of the film. Cornish is also very good in her role as is Channing Tatum as the best friend. No matter where you stand on the actual war, that shouldn't keep you away from this film, which is quite original in how it tells its story and most importantly it does pay tribute to these kids who lost their lives on the battle field. This is a very strong and highly emotional film that pushes all the right buttons and really delivers."

","As it is in the Iraq War as it has been since wars started once mankind figured out how to use hunting tools as weapons, the nature of the soldier is to fight. The military man doesn't question policy or the reasons why he's in a war, he just does the best he can and try to survive. <br/><br/>Which is what Sergeant Ryan Phillippe, hometown hero from Brazos, Texas who's done his tour of duty and is given the horrible piece of news that he's been ordered for another tour of duty in Iraq. They call it Stop-Loss hence the title of the film.<br/><br/>Phillippe's last action in Iraq involved a nasty urban fire fight where some good friends were killed. He just wants to go back to civilian life and kick back. But the army wants his combat experience.<br/><br/>What to do. Probably if Phillippe came from some liberal blue state he'd find a lot more sympathy in his course of action. But he comes from that reddest of red states, Texas. It's a whole different mindset there and his very upbringing is telling him he's got to shoulder the burden of arms again.<br/><br/>Stop-Loss is a good film from director/writer Kimberly Peirce who brought us Boys Don't Cry. Stop-Loss is not as powerful as Boys Don't Cry still it sends a powerful if conflicted message for the young people today who might just contemplate a military enlistment.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are also in the film as Phillippe's fellow soldiers who have differing attitudes towards the army and the Iraq War. Hard to know what is right in a situation like this. Where you're brought up and by who might be the reason you take one course of action as opposed to another.<br/><br/>For what Phillippe does and the rest do, you have to go see Stop-Loss. And this review is dedicated to all of the men and women in arms for the United States of America who carry out our policy and put their bodies and lives on the line for us.

The people that keep saying this movie is stupid and boring need to get a life. I don't think that some people are mature enough for a movie like this. The people that say this movie didn't have enough action are correct. The only thing was though is that their didn't have to be any action. This movie was to show you what the war is really like. First of all it says it is a drama. This movie was so far the saddest movie I have seen yet this year. It was filled with a ton of meaning and heart. This goes to show you what the war can really do to someone after they return or well they are in it. The acting was extremely well acted between all the characters. The whole entire cast was brilliant. When I saw this cast the first thing I said to myself is I have to see this movie. Ryan Phillipe was the best out of all the actors in this movie. I think that he should get nominated for best actor in this film. Channing Tatum did a great job as well. This was probably in my opinion his best role so far. The messages in this movie were great as well. When I had left the theatre all I could keep thinking of was this movie. This movie seriously changed the way I look at war now.

","This is one of those so-called ""Hollywood Social Commentary"" films that wants to have it both ways. And believe me, in this film, both ways are clichéd and stereotypical. STOP-LOSS is a 21st Century John Wayne Film dealing with some anti-war sentiment but clearly ending on the note that ""If you are a MAN in today's society, you get your act together and march off to war with your buddies."" In many ways the film was a great sequel to TAXI TO THE DARK SIDE as it portrayed a military equally as insane and out of control, a quasi FRAT PARTY/ANIMAL HOUSE extravaganza mixed in with a Texas Red Neck world of repressed homo-erotic proofs of masculinity. This movie had it all in one scene after another of clichéd imagery. And then rebellious military deserter Ryan Phillippe goes on a ""Road Trip"" with best friend's girlfriend, an artificial storyline manipulation to visit families of dead servicemen, maimed soldiers in military hospitals, etc. and finally to broach the issue of fleeing to Canada or Mexico. But male honor and patriotism win out in the end, as all freshly scrubbed and handsome, he rides off into the sunset on a bus with his buddies back to Iraq and a world that a few minutes before he assured everyone he could never again tolerate. FULL METAL JACKET meets SANDS OF IWO JIMA . But in the end, John Wayne rides again!

"zetes","7","11","22","30 March 2008"," Too many clichés, but it's hard not to be moved
","The long-absent director of Boys Don't Cry returns with her sophomore feature, an Iraq War drama. Ryan Phillipe plays a Texan who returns home from a terrible tour in Iraq to find that the Army has ""stop-lossed"" him, meaning they have re-recruited him, though he was supposed to get out of the service. He decides to run and try to fight it. Channing Tatum and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play two of his buddies who fought beside him and also live in the same small town. Truth be told, I wanted to see this movie mostly for Gordon-Levitt, and he delivers the best performance in the film. Phillipe is good, too, but he does not affect a very good Texas accent, which gets annoying. The film is unfortunately created pretty much entirely from clichés. Think ""redneck soldiers"" and you can write a lot of the scenes yourself. Plenty of scenes where guys in cowboy hats and boots shoot at stuff with shotguns from the back of pickup trucks. And we get the old Vietnam vet cliché of the guys mistaking Texas reality for the horrors of war, complete with echoes of gunfire and helicopters in the background. It also suffers from MTV-style editing, and, in fact, it was produced by MTV, which is a difficult stigma to overcome. The opening sequence in Iraq, which haunts Phillipe for the rest of the film, is edited too much like an action sequence, in that it's meant to elicit feelings of excitement rather than horror. Peirce has said in interviews that she was influenced by the videos real soldiers were making in Iraq, and it's kind of unfair to dismiss this kind of film-making. These soldiers, after all, are certainly influenced by MTV themselves. Still, the MTV aesthetic always tends to make things seem plastic and distanced. It might be true that the soldiers' videos are a way for them to distance themselves from reality, although that's getting away from any subject the film itself wants to explore. But, even with the clichés and the bad film-making, the film ends up succeeding, at least a little. It brings to light the whole stop-loss issue, which is not discussed enough in the media (it is, as the film says, just a back-door draft), and it gets the audience to think about what is happening to soldiers and to empathize with them. I'm sure we all say we have great empathy for their situation, but, those who don't know anybody who is fighting this war don't ever have to deal with it on an emotional level. Even when we watch the news, we tend to engage with it in a more intellectual manner than we would with a story. And I think it is partly because most of us in the voting populace dealt with the Iraq War mostly on an intellectual level that we were never able to prevent it or bring it to a close."

It has the clichés running straight through it from start to finish, and it wouldn't have been so bad if the directing, script, dialog were any good.<br/><br/>I think the actors did a decent job with what they had to work with, and there were some intriguing ideas, but they weren't new ones and they weren't done skillfully.<br/><br/>In the end we wonder what he learned if anything from his actions.

Instead he goes off with his pal's girl, setting the stage for a number of infidelity scenes, which to the dismay of the male viewer never comes to fruition, and then in the most anti-climatic fashion he makes yet another u-turn?<br/><br/>Like so many other Hollywood movies they could have easily made this movie more plausible, but true to the commercial Hollywood spirit they chose to appeal to our primitive senses instead of our intellect.<br/><br/>How Sad."

","Over acted, heavy handed, full of speeches, preachy, on the nose, and over stylized in a way only MTV could be guilty of, Stop-Loss is agit-prop garbage. I expected a lot more with talented young actors such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but Screenwriter/Director Kimberly Peirce does a hatchet job of portraying the ill effects of war on American youth. I'm sure she did some work researching the Iraq war and the young men fighting in it, but you'd never guess it from watching Stop-Loss.

"personanonxista","10","12","27","29 March 2008"," A Great ""Wake-Up America and Smell the Brimstone"" movie
","Every man, woman, and child in America should see this film. It will, in time, I believe, go down as one of the all-time great American urban warfare movies.<br/><br/>To be sure, there was no scarcity of fodder to feed anti-war political rhetoric throughout most of the 113 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The two most memorable scenes, for me were: 1. When Sgt. Brandon King, sought to reverse his ""Stop Loss Upon Orders of the President of the United States of America"" by appealing to the fairness of his Commanding Officer, he was sternly reminded that the President's Order superseded his own. King's response of ""F**k the President of the United States, respectfully, Sir!"", brought loud cheers, whistles, and applause from many, not all, in the theater audience.<br/><br/>2. Sgt. Brandon King entered a building in which the enemy combatants had fled. He heard gunfire, then the cries from his advance man, two floors above, that he had been shot. Though wounded, he was warning King, apprising him of the location and number of enemy in the building. Sgt. King fought his way, taking out the enemy, room by room, until he reached his soldier's position. When he found his wounded comrade, he saw, standing before him, an Iraqi appearing to be frightened, holding a boy of 5 or 6 years in his arms. The ""Haji"" extended his arm from behind the boy, held him like a shield, then dropped a grenade in a suicidal attempt to kill himself, the boy, King and his wounded comrade. Thanks to quick reflexes, King was able to save himself and his soldier; the Iraqi man and boy perished in the blast.<br/><br/>This, for me, was the defining moment. I knew then, without reservation, that The War Against Terror is a war we must win. Forget about all the reasons why we are in this war or why we shouldn't be in it. It's too late for polemics; we're in it and there's no turning back the clock. It's kill or be killed.<br/><br/>As of this moment, what we had thought was a winding down of hostilities, a successful ""Surge,"" was merely a regrouping strategy by the enemy. Fighting has resumed ""Big Time,"" and in areas we had come to believe were calm. Complacency is, indeed, the vacation land of fools.<br/><br/>Americans, with the exception of family and friends of soldiers, have become disconnected from the war. They have become like the spiritually exhausted women of T.S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufock,"" those who only ""come and go Talking of Michelangelo."" We are fighting a many-headed Hydra with one intention and many names: ""Army of the Mahdi,"" ""Militia,"" ""Insurgents,"" ""Al Qaeda,"" ""Shia,"" ""Sunni,"" ""Sufi,"" etc. One or another of them pretends to temporarily ally with us, but are, in truth, a ""Judas"" in our midst, a thumb opposing four fingers, but they are one hand.<br/><br/>We are in mortal combat with Evil; make no mistake about it. Islam is not a peaceful religion, its entire motivation is Jihad. It always has been a terrorist religion since before June 8, 632 A.D.<br/><br/>Islam and Terrorism are synonymous.<br/><br/>Islam has always been about murderous conquest. In 732 A.D. the Mediterranean Sea was, for all intents and purposes, a Muslim Lake.<br/><br/>If not for Charles ""The Hammer"" Martel winning the Battle of Tours in 732 A.D., which has traditionally been characterized as the decisive world historical event, since it preserved western Europe from Muslim conquest and Islamization, you might very well be reading this in Arabic at this moment.<br/><br/>The time has come to take the gloves off and purge the world of this monstrous Evil of Islamofascism forevermore, not in a war of attrition, but one of annihilation.<br/><br/>If we do not prosecute this war with every means available to us now, there will be no one to fight for us in the future. The two, three, four, and five tour volunteers are exhausted, bravely fighting on, though wounded in mind and body.<br/><br/>Soon, over 70,000 American soldiers will begin to suffer the Vietnam Era Agent Orange Syndrome as a result of exposure to Depleted Uranium. What will be your fate when this ""Thin Red Line"" of courage is no longer able to withstand the Forces of Evil? George Santayana's admonition,""Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it."", is more true today than ever."

","Director-writer Kimberly Peirce has proved she can make a film of high intensity and great conflict while still showing the human side when she made ""Boys Don't Cry."" That movie was based on an actual murder of butch lesbian, not a mainstream topic, and Hilary Swank won her first Oscar playing the lead.<br/><br/>Not one to shy away from controversial subjects,Peirce has recently released ""Stop Loss"". On the movie's web site, there's a section entitled""Comments"" and there's a brief video of her encouraging visitors to ask questions with an opportunity to view all previous posts.<br/><br/>As I write this on March 29, 2008, recent news has broadcasted escalated violence in Basra with theShi'ities and Sunnies with no end in sight. However,slang for both is Hajji,a derogatory term used by the American military supposedly there to protect them.<br/><br/>What makes this film stand out from ""Re.Acted"" is that its screenplay does not portray them as simple minded grunts. The opening starts off with a quite realistic ambush actually filmed in Morocco, of which there will be many flashbacks beginning with the ceremony of the survivors coming back home to Texas to the end of the picture.<br/><br/>There actually is a reverence for the military and even a ""lest we forget"" to those Americans who lost their lives in this single episode of which no other is needed. But the flashbacks also shows the deaths of Iraqis that include women and children that haunts the platoon leader in charge, played by Ryan Phillipe.<br/><br/>Others in that patrol aren't doing so well either. Both Joseph Gordon Levitt and Channing Tatum get on mean drunks. In facts, Tatum beats his girlfriend,beating not shown, Abie Cornish, who will join Phillipe in his Odyssey to prevent getting stop lossed.<br/><br/>I have never heard of the expression of ""Stop Loss"" before and when Peirce heard it, it inspired her to create a story of someone coming back in high esteem and purple heart and getting just that, being forced to return to Iraq completely disillusioned.<br/><br/>Phillipe shows the same kind of quiet intensity he displayed in ""Flags of Our Fathers"", which also has disillusionment as one of its main themes. It's been hours since I've seen it and I'm still recalling it which for me means I was very much impressed with this film."
"Dan1863Sickles","1","5","9","1 December 2009"," No Matter Where You Stand, This Movie Will Leave You Feeling Insulted And Ripped Off!
","I find it terribly ironic that ""left wing"" Hollywood continues to hedge its bets, making these awful lukewarm movies that neither condemn the war on terror nor embrace it.<br/><br/>If you're a Sixties survivor and a committed pacifist, and you're hoping for an all-out condemnation of war like BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY or ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT, this movie will really feel like a rip off. None of these soldiers actually question this war, or any war, or the idea of war. They just gripe about having to do another tour.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you're a patriotic American who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this movie will really feel like a rip off. None of these soldiers loves America, or even loves the service. The way they pout and sulk makes them come across more like suburban teenagers than blue collar tough guys. It's not WE WERE SOLDIERS, and it's not SANDS OF IWO JIMA. It's not even mindless action, and the war scenes are less RAMBO and more BUFFY.<br/><br/>Ryan Philippe so completely cannot carry this kind of movie. Though he's devastatingly sexy, in a rough trade, men's room, bisexual sort of way, it's hard to picture him as a slow-talking' Texas boy who wants to stand up and be counted. This is no Sgt. Croft in Mailer's THE NAKED AND THE DEAD. He's more like Joel in Truman Capote's OTHER VOICES, OTHER ROOMS. He can't sell you on the idea that he's been in combat and done his bit, OR that he wants his woman and wants her right now. He fizzles on the battlefield and in the bedroom scenes, looking as if he would much prefer to bend over and take a good stiff attack from the rear."

","Can you think of a time when the light at the end of the tunnel is what keeps you going? But just imagine, you get to the end, and the tunnel gets longer . . .<br/><br/>Let's not talk about the war - the war in Iraq must be one of the most divisive topics around. But you maybe have to talk to the people involved. And if it is your brother, your sister, your son or sweetheart serving, what's most important then? Come home. Know that I love you. Know that I'm proud of you. And for the guy serving? Do my job as well as I can. Hold my head up. Stop my buddies getting killed.<br/><br/>Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) is completing his last tour of duty. When he gets home he is celebrated as a hero. Happy and relieved. Then, together with several other men, he is 'stop-lossed.' A legal clause that can force a soldier to perform extra active service beyond his initial terms. A Catch-22.<br/><br/>Director Kimberly Peirce (best known for Boys Don't Cry) is expert at teasing out heavy emotional subject matter. ""This movie is definitely pro-soldier,"" she says. ""It may not be pro the Stop-Loss policy. But we have tried to honour and to show with great compassion and understanding the unique experience of these brave men and women and the effect that war has, not only on them, but on their families, friends and everyone around them."" Written into the contracts, stop-loss still comes as an emotional six-ball. And it's the story of over 80,000 troops since 9/11. The difficulty of adapting to civilian life is compounded by life-and-death duty tours just when you thought it was all over. A girl waiting to marry. Parents praying every night for the safe return of their sons - and having their hopes realised only to be dashed.<br/><br/>Stop-Loss is the most pro-troops Iraq war-film I have yet witnessed. You will shed tears for the bravery and commitment even if you are a total pacifist. But the real heartbreaker is for the people who suffer with such uncertainty back home. Iraq action scenes are horrific, bloody and full of complex challenges. But I sat and cried for the waiting women. Their emotional journeys are nightmarish rides into an unsure future.<br/><br/>""I see it as a unique set of circumstances, not a sweeping indictment of any group, or of the military, or the Administration,"" says Phillippe (some of the criticisms have even been that it portrays the Army too leniently.) ""Although it does say something about the situation we're in, what's at the heart of the drama is what happens to these guys when they come back home and can't cope.""<br/><br/>Many films about Iraq have poor attendance seemingly because of low emotional momentum. Not so here. Powerful acting and superb characterisation is coupled with an emotional pile-driver that punches the story-layers with heart-rending intensity. Peirce's soldiers are no sad stereotypes. Based on many interviews, we see how different mentalities cope  or fail to cope  with the pressure. Nothing feels staged (except, perhaps, when Brandon's scar miraculously heals). Abbie Cornish is superb as the fiancée of Brandon's childhood buddy, and her glamorous looks conceal a thoughtful and resourceful young woman. She is determined to do what is right for her and the people in her life. But what anyone can 'do' always faces a balance-sheet of reality. Stop-Loss is a film where ideals take second place to human love, but without being sacrificed in the process.<br/><br/>Scenes in Tikrit (filmed in Morocco) seemed to me as convincing and colourful as those in Texas. Both of them opened my mind. Problems of psychological adjustment that many people have to go through are eloquently portrayed and succeeded in humbling me. War has been romanticised in every age. And we block out the seriousness of post-battle syndromes. Knowing the reality might or might not change our beliefs or make us stop. But sometimes we have to focus on the choices we can take rather than a world we would ideally make."
"zardoz-13","7","4","7","2 April 2008"," Soldiers Don't Cry
","""Boys Don't Cry"" director Kimberley Peirce's new anti-war movie ""Stop-Loss"" (**1/2 out of ****) draws its title from an unfair Pentagon policy that obliges troops to perform back-to-back tours of duty in Afghanistan and Iraq. The chief problem with this ambitious, sincere, but unbelievable protest film is it cannot decide which is more important, exposing an unfair military practice or depicting the trauma of combat veterans reentering civilian life. Meanwhile, despite the unpopularity of the Iraq war, ""Stop-Loss"" doesn't lob any grenades at our anti-terrorist objectives in the Middle East. Indeed, its spineless ending goes out of the way to support the larger political consensus for the necessity the war. The strongest that ""Stop-Loss"" gets is when the protagonist uses the F-word in his comments about the President as Commander-in-Chief using a loophole to force him to go back to Iraq. Inevitably, ""Stop-Loss"" refuses to glamorize the war and cherry picks obvious clichés that filmmakers resorted to in early epics like such as ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July"" to make war appear unsavory business.<br/><br/>""Stop-Loss"" opens with overexposed home video excerpts lensed by U.S. troops in a manner that recalls an earlier Iraq war movie ""Gunnar Palace."" The scene shifts then to a roadblock in Tikrit, Iraq, manned by Sgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe of ""Flags of Our Fathers""), Sgt. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum of ""Step Up""). Pvt. Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt of ""The Lookout"") and Pvt. Rico Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk of ""Haven"") and shows them checking vehicles with suspicious passengers. Out of nowhere careens a carload of terrorists shooting up the countryside with an assault rifle. King and company go in hot pursuit and find themselves trapped in an ambush with rooftop bushwhackers firing rifle-propelled grenades. This harrowing firefight at close quarters between U.S. soldiers and terrorists in an urban setting recalls ""Black Hawk Down."" Although several soldiers die in this ambush, Pvt. Rodriguez survives at the loss of his vision as well as an arm and a leg.<br/><br/>King's tour of duty is up, and he celebrates going home with his long-time friend Shriver. In their hometown of Brazos, Texas, King receives a Bronze Star for valor along with a Purple Heart from Senator Orton Worrell (Josef Sommer of ""Silkwood"") and promises his help in any future endeavors. King is just about to turn in his gear when he learns to his chagrin that the military has decided to extend his term of contract. Meanwhile, Burgess's wife kicks him out of their house and Shriver has his own troubles with his girlfriend, Michelle (Australian actress Abbie Cornish of ""A Good Year""), who wants him out of the Army and into her arms as a husband.<br/><br/>King refuses to return to Iraq. When his helpful commander, Lt. Col. Boot Miller (Timothy Olyphant of ""Hitman"") tries to confine him to the stockade until their departure date, King beats up his escort and escapes. King decides to call on Senator to make his case. Angry at Shriver, Michelle drives King to Washington, D.C. for his meeting with the Senator. Along the way, they learn about how the courts have intervened on the behalf of the military in all 'stop-loss' lawsuits. Briefly, King visits Rico, now minus half an arm and half a leg in a rehabilitation clinic. Shriver finds Michelle and King on the road and tries to convince him to turn himself in while he still has the chance.<br/><br/>Clearly, director Kimberley Peirce and scenarist Mark Richmond of ""Huff"" wore their hearts on their sleeves like stripes when they wrote this sympathy for the soldier saga. They have created several interesting soldiers and relatives and win our sympathy and provoke our outrage. King explains at one point that 'stop-loss' was designed to forgo the draft. Eventually, he decides that desertion seems the only alternative. Sadly, rather than forging ahead into turbulent waters with its anti-protest theme, ""Stop-Loss"" blows its own retreat to preserve the status quo and its amounts to a message-laden but far-fetched furlough from reality."
"chasfred","10","8","18","30 March 2008"," It's more than it appears
","Previous narrative treatments of the Iraq conflict have been created by people of the Vietnam era and inevitably suffer when they tell their tale most effectively through characters of that generation. While there are many similarities there are significant differences. For my money Pierce nailed in many ways how our current military is addicting people into a path of self-destruction. The slow revelation of lives unraveling as a result of mechanisms developed to survive immoral circumstance was most telling for me, surpassing previous powerful if flawed films. Kudos to Pierce, a masterful work. If they stay away, the problem is in us, not the film."

It made me even more grateful for what they are doing over there, whether I agree with the reason we went there or not.<br/><br/>The movie was not at all what I expected it to be.

In fact, it was a thought provoking, action packed, and engaging plot.<br/><br/>I will buy this movie when it comes out and would recommend it to others."
"rcreekmur","9","8","18","28 March 2008"," Hope this movie opens some eyes!
","I know the leaders of this country will view Stop-Loss as a work of fiction, but I hope it manages to open some eyes to the incredible pain and suffering our military action in Iraq is causing to a huge cross section of the American public. Not only have 4000 American lives been lost - and 4000 families paid dearly for the greed of the wealthy - but many thousands more have been maimed for life both mentally and physically all because of the liars who convinced the country this was the right thing to do.<br/><br/>There are some incredibly powerful acting performances in this film by a group of young, mostly unknown actors. There is nothing false or unbelievable in any of this film's scenes and the raw emotion comes through with the words, expressions and actions of the perfectly directed cast. It's hard not to get caught up in the emotion - and become angry and what this country has done to a generation of young men and women.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like the hand-held shaky-cam technique used to film the war scenes in Iraq. We've seen this and yes, it's supposed to create a more intense feeling of realism, but it doesn't. It's distracting and makes it harder to follow the action than it should be. I kept hoping they would pull back on it, but they didn't. This is my only real criticism of the entire film and I was glad when things moved back stateside so we could get on with telling the story without letting technique dominate content.<br/><br/>As powerful as the performances are of the young men who play soldiers in this movie, the camera sure does love Abbie Cornish. Her role is so pivotal because she represents yet another, deeper level of destruction caused by the war - the people at home who have to cope with the tortured American souls this conflict creates. She steals the scenes in which she appears, and often she doesn't even have to say or do anything to do so. Often her look alone convey more than any words could possibly do.<br/><br/>This is a film every American should see - and react to. Stop the damage now! Let's start restoring America's good name in the world and stop being the international bully we've become. We're paying too dear a price in maimed, disabled, dead and scarred American lives. Stop Loss shows it all and if you truly believe the rich in the country are rich enough, do something about it!"
"janyeap","9","8","18","25 March 2008"," Survival as a Band of Brothers
","Bold, heart-wrenching and very dramatic, this film lashes out on the topic of Iraq war syndrome that many would rather avoid discussing, lest put it on screen. However, Director Kimberly Peirce, who has a brother serving in Iraq, opted to bring her insider-story to expose the human side of those young men, returning home from the war. Oh yes, young men who have now come home, but are still being tested beyond their ability to withstand the drain and strain; each and every one of them continues to be heavily challenged in his search for self identity in regard to the importance of family bond, the loyalty of friendship, the limits of love, and the value of honor.<br/><br/>The story first introduces the audience to a group of young men, operating in the dangerous streets of Iraq. Indeed, a band of brothers who has bonded over time, and who has fought side-by-side and keeping themselves alive by being there for one another. Their loyalty bond is unblemished. We then see the survivors finally returning to their little Texas hometown, welcomed with a Main Street parade and joyous celebrations to crown them as American heroes. But, with the glorious razzmatazz of tributes and show extravaganzas ending, who really cares about these young war veterans? Writer/Director does and her very touching film allows the audience to follow the lives of a few young men, seemingly wounded, either physically or mentally, as they adjust to civilian life. <br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe's Brandon has completed two tours; Channing Tatum's Steve has already served one and plans to marry his hometown gal, Michelle. Then, there's Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tommy, and many, many others all of them, seemingly no different from their community of young men who had not been to war at least until we observe them closely. So many of them have a lot of healing to do, and like their days spent in Iraq, these young veterans depend on one another's protection, and with one leader keeping them in order. Yes, Brandon is always there for them; always taking charge and never letting them down. <br/><br/>Observe the effects war has had on these young men. Study how their families try to reach out to them. And as the story unfolds, the audience, just like these young soldiers, will come to realize that the government's policy has its way of enslaving young soldiers to eternal service. What if Brandon has to be deployed back to Iraq? How would stop-loss affect his life and the lives of those traumatized and hurting veterans he protects? The stories of these young men are very compelling to follow and their feelings are tragic and intense as we examine the camaraderie these young soldiers share. It's about survival as a group; it's about their need and determination to protect each other. And it's about a soldier who feels betrayed by his government. <br/><br/>With appropriately edited in flashbacks of horrendous war scenes, the film creates an insight of the causes and effects to the soldiers' traumatic stress disorders. We study their fear, their courage and bravery, their traumatic sufferings, their pride and their hardship. This film also defines the meaning of the film's title, letting the audience see how stop-loss has its rippling bad effects on even the finest soldier. And what we capture from the story is that stop-loss does abuse the faith of soldiers. Brandon is being stop-lossed, Should he AWOL to Canada or Mexico, or should he willingly and dutifully return to Iraq? Young men volunteer to fight a war for different reasons, but ultimately, it's their being inseparable members of their unit, or band of brothers, that would ultimately leave them to decide how they'd deal with the war. Oh yes, it's not hard to see that stop-loss is no different from back-door draft. Does it appeal to those with little else to lose in life, or as a trade-off for criminal pardon, or as a death-sentencing certificate for a already injured illegal alien serving with the US Troops and whose death allows his family members to gain access to 'green cards? <br/><br/>Great cinematic realism, phenomenal performances by the cast ensemble, a story well-crafted with solid psychological analysis and depth, and an absolutely powerful, emotional, and heart-wrenching film to watch! It's a film that cries out in ""Support of Our Troops""."
"ambrosia_1","6","6","14","4 April 2008"," Decent movie, but tried too hard not to put off those with differing views.
","(I rated the movie 6, not because it is bad, but because it is better than average. Not an instant classic, not action-packed, but not overly preachy.) If you are with other people of differing political views, no one is going to leave this movie feeling their position was disparaged. But neither will anyone leave feeling ""vindicated"" by their views. As such, the movie fails to be deeply satisfying for either audience and thus, hasn't done better at the box office.<br/><br/>""Stop-Loss"" takes a cue from another politically-themed movie, ""Shooter"", pairing the lead character with his best friends' finance' as he seeks to fight the ""injustice"" done to him by his ""Stop-Loss"".<br/><br/>As I've said, while decent, ""Stop-Loss"" tries too hard not to offend those with differing political views. Problem is, the very theme of the movie is to criticize a current and highly questionable military practice, so trying not to offend Conservative viewers is a complete waste since they are not the ones coming to see such a movie, and you fail to give the other 80% of movie goers that would have no problem listening to criticism of the government, what they expect.<br/><br/>All of the soldiers in Shadow-3, including the main character, are all dedicated soldiers that believe in the job they are doing, though maybe not the way they are being told to do it. Criticism of ""policy"" is rare and criticism of the government in the movie is nonexistent, thus coming off as less than truthful trying so hard not to offend movie goers of either persuasion.<br/><br/>A good movie, decently acted, even with the over-the-top and clichéd' portrayal of life in Texas. It will hold your attention and you will be interested in seeing how the story plays out, so in that regard, a movie worth seeing no matter your political persuasion, and good for mixed groups with varying views."

","The movie is overall important to see for the message it offers but, aside from that, it's not special. Ryan Phillippe's character, that should be the most important, is probably less believable than the Channing Tatum's one. It just gave the impression that he was not hard enough to play that part. The real stars of the film are Joseph Gordon Levitt and Abbie Cornish, and the lead's father as well acts very convincingly. I reckon the film is intense, very much message oriented and interesting on the whole (flashback war sequences strike a lot). I only disliked Ryan Phillipp's acting, but being him the most important character, I think the story itself ended up being a little unlikely."

","Stop Loss has an important message for those disconnected from the US military: our servicemen are being asked to do more combat tours than ever before in the history of the US military. Since the end of the Draft after the Viet Nam War all combat operations are carried out by the limited number of volunteer GIs. Okay, they volunteered, but with the numbers in the Army, National Guard, Reserves, and Marines, they are being asked to do too much time in combat; hence the massive numbers suffering from PTSD, ballooning suicide numbers, spousal abuse, and other problems experienced by and caused by returning servicemen.<br/><br/>Stop the senseless wars that should not be fought and are not worth the sacrifice of our young volunteers or our nation's resources. And, bring back the Draft so the whole nation feels the pain when we go to war. Stop Loss makes this case."

","By definition, Stop-Loss is an order issued by the United States that would extend one's time in action after their time serving is done during times of war. This movie is a powerful, tragic look on the trauma soldiers face after leaving the action. We see how these lives are far from normal and how war not only personally affects them, but the lives around them. This film may be seen to have a political agenda, but then again the Iraqi war was all just for political nonsense in the first place.<br/><br/>Kimberly Peirce's film is about a U.S Army Staff Sergeant named Brandon who becomes traumatized along with this two friends back home after he accidentally killed innocent people overseas. While thinking he is home for good, he realizes that he is going to be sent back despite his resistance.<br/><br/>This film is well-acted and is full of rising stars. Ryan Phillippe does a good job as Brandon and he makes us sympathize for him and practically every soldier on he job. Channing Tatum is pretty good even though I felt he seemed a little wooden and moody. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is my favorite actor in this movie and I wish I saw more of him in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a powerful take on what war will do to you and how it will change you. This is a film about today's generation of wars and how powerful they have become. Like it or not, the United States was in a war for no reason and despite all the bravery, these young men were dying for no reason. That is what the message of the film is. It's an underrated, but vastly powerful film. I rate this film 9/10."

","I enjoy making up ""double-bill"" evening nights with films that match in some way--both versions of The Maltese Falcon, for instance, or two films about pianists. An evening spent watching both Stop-Loss and The Hurt Locker comparing their strengths and weakness was fascinating,comparing brilliant and committed performances from the two lead actors, Ryan Phillippe and Jeremy Remmer. The latter film seems to center on the kind of man who is addicted to war and does his job well, but Peirce's film shows a bright young man from Texas who experiences some brutal battle, has done his time, and then is called back, simply because the war is eating up the other volunteers. It is curious that what was once a strictly male director's province, i.e., war films, has been usurped by two women: both Peirce and Kathleen Bigelow delve deeply into the male experience of battle, the former also connecting with what the people back home are feeling and experiencing. Both films question the validity of war from different viewpoints, and while not luridly political, deliver some scathing commentary on its effects on the human mind; while Stop-Loss is no Paths of Glory, it is effective story-telling, perhaps enlightening viewers clueless about those who are shipped overseas more than once."

""Stop-Loss"" is so different from other war films, as it portrays the other side of war. It does not tell how glorious wars are, but the physical and psychological traumas that entails from these gruesome wars. The portrayals of the trauma are very real, ranging from physical disability, flashbacks, difficulty adjusting to civilian life and disrupted social relationships back home. These problems are so real and authentic, making the plot so engaging and effective. I did not like the ending though, as I do not quite understand the psychological processes behind Ryan Philippe's character's decision.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to view the life of a soldier from a different perspective, and I am pleasantly surprised by ""Stop-Loss""."

","To those of you thinking not everyone in the military is a beer guzzling, hick, you are right. But it is also true that a lot of us hated what's happening in Iraq and Afghanistan. We love our country and respect most of our leaders. Not all, but most. We in the 82nd airborne, Medic unit Mash 3 love our country but know that this is a bloodbath and nothing more. Another rich defense contractors war. Where are the Senators sons/daughters. Comfortable in their wealth away from any of this. It's a real portrayal of a slice of characters in another senseless fiasco. So making this 10 lines I will also say that you can't speak unless you were there. You didn't see it the way it really was and is. Ridiculous to keep these wars going when our own country has no health care, losing jobs, foreclosures. It's all one sided. Bravo Kimberly Peirce for yet another brilliantly direct film."
"Robert_duder","7","1","1","21 March 2010"," Another anti-Iraq war movie but this one shows a different side
","Stop Loss is unique. Almost surprisingly given the content of the film. We have had a plethora of anti-Iraq films the most recent of course being The Hurt Locker which gained critical acclaim including Best Picture at the Academy Awards. So how is this film different? First of all I believe that Stop Loss was made with the intent of appealing to a young demographic. I think they are trying to show young impressionable people how this affects people who are in their own age demo, and also what it is like for these soldiers. They due this by bringing in a cast of well known hot young up and comers, a simplistic story, and a strong lead character. The film is more entertaining than educational but does both easily. There is nothing wrong with any of this and its also refreshing to have a film about the current war from the perspective of stateside and a soldier wrestling with emotions and guilt to return to the war. The film has very little scenes of the actual war and instead is really showing us the soldiers who are affected afterword and their lives as they try to piece it together. It is certainly well worth seeing but unfortunately isn't as intense or effective as it tries to be.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe headlines the cast as a brave solider tormented with visions of the things they've done. Phillippe is good, he's as good as he always is and that is good but never truly great. He shows a lot of emotion and holds the film well and fits the bill for the aforementioned attempt at bringing in a younger demographic. Another young up and coming star is Channing Tatum who gets some really meaty emotions as he displays PTSD. Tatum gets the most as far as emotions but really doesn't get a lot of depth beyond that to his character. I'm quite convinced having seen him in a few things as of late that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just a skip away from an Academy Award nomination. I don't mean to say his performance in this film is necessarily worthy of that but he always does an incredible job and really grabs on to a character. As Tommy Burgess he's an alcoholic, torn apart by memories of the war, and losing his wife. Lovely actor Abbie Cornish plays Tatum's wife, Michelle. She also does a good job of playing the girl next door, nice southern belle wife and has good chemistry with Phillippe. She never gets much character development however despite her involvement in the story.<br/><br/>Heavily acclaimed director Kimberly Peirce who gained awards and notoriety for the 'just okay' film (in my opinion) Boys Don't Cry is still very new to directing. I think she is the type of director who gets her hands on a cause and wants to show it off using her talents. She also co-wrote the film with Mark Richard and neither of them really have a lot of big screen credits to their name. I only point this out because Stop Loss in the hands of a more experienced director and writer could have really been something to take notice of. Unfortunately whether you chalk it up to inexperience with the film makers or an attempt at mainstreaming a serious message the film is good but never great and unfortunately will most likely be forgotten in a sea of Iraq based war films. I honestly didn't feel that something so acclaimed like The Hurt Locker was that far ahead of Stop Loss but opinions only mean so much. 7.5/10"

","I really decided I'm gonna watch this movie for the actors and actors only. You know,Ryan Philippe and Channing Tatum both together in the same movie it's like a dream. I found to realize that what supposed to be a good military movie actually became a friendship-romance triangle. I kept thinking,when is Philippe gonna sleep with Michelle(Tatum s girlfriend). The tension was keeping me awake for the first 30 minutes. I also predicted that Tommy is going to kill himself as the last scene where he holds the guitar and everything starts to turn to slow-motion scene. The director gave a little more softer side to guys than it should. Even the girls in the movie are stronger and manly than the male characters. I really liked the memory-scenes where they kept rewinding the Iraq situation. Finally isn't it great that Philippe changed his mind after 1h.40 min and decided to be ""the man"" and support his friend in good and bad until war do us part? This movie is based on a very girly point of view of war"

","Stop-Loss involves some decent acting from Ryan Phillippe and his supporting cohorts. The movie plays it safe for the most part, not offering much new besides the subject material. I liked how the main character grappled with the Stop Loss problem - you can sense the injustice, but reality of contracts sets in. Story lines throughout the movie have been done before. There's honor, friendship, commitment etc etc....(spoiler) the closing scenes seem to come full circle and leaving us wondering what the whole fuss was about. Likewise, the final shots, I noticed the big bold US ARMY logos on uniforms and couldn't help wondering if the movie went that direction as sponsored so by the military (ie selling out). If you like fairly well done dramas, Stop Loss is a decent watch - but it doesn't offer any answers. It looks to inform us of a problem and then meekly get in line."
"bloodymonday","6","1","1","28 July 2008"," Review: Stop-Loss
","The word ""Stop-Loss"" comes from US Military policy that concerning an involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service date (thanks again, Wiki!).<br/><br/>Imagine what if you have one real good material on your hands, but you don't have any idea how to tell it properly. ""Stop-Loss"" is the movie with such a great potential. But all they've accomplished was spending times on far less intriguing plot that building around the story. In the end, this is just one big frustrating motion picture that should have no, must have been excellence.<br/><br/>Brandon (Ryan Phillippe), Steve (Channing Tatum) and Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are three childhood friends and decorated war heroes who just got back from Iraq. Each of them has a goal in life to fulfill. For Brandon, he thinks he had it enough with the whole war things. But soon he realized that he have been stoplossed that required him to go back duty to Iraq. Against his will, Brandon and Steve's soon-to-be wife, Michelle (Abbie Cornish) decided to go to Washington DC and seeking help from senator. Since leader of the gang like Brandon was AWOL, it's only Steve to take a full responsibility for their group instead. And it's a bad time indeed, since in the most troubled friend like Tommy is about going to lose his grip.<br/><br/>From the sound of this, it should be an important film since this ""Stop-Loss"" policy obviously has a big loophole. And it's going to be interesting, if they decided to do an expose piece to point out that what went wrong with that policy. But somehow the director, Kimberly Peirce (her second directorial gig since disturbingly masterpiece ""Boy Don't Cry"") interested in brotherhood and post-war traumatize instead. And bad new is she didn't exactly did such a good job at all. An only three dimensional character I saw was a leading man Brandon (more on that later). In the meantime, his fellow friends are left unexplored (especially Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Tommy who has not only an absolute caricature character, but also poorly used to create any necessary tension between other characters). And while Brandon and Michelle travel together, there is a sexual tension going on between them. But the film did a poor job depicting it, and that's mean the whole point of that plot structure have gone completely wasted.<br/><br/>Like I've said, considering the topic they aimed for, the story itself is really weak by comparison. For the whole time, we saw Brandon travels to get some help. But after the trip came to an end, it kind of makes you feel that it is an absolutely unnecessary trip. Brandon can't get help as he hoped for. And his alternative solution (to run away) is planned and then dumped in a last minute without a proper explanation. Even when something really bad happened that eventually made everybody to re-evaluate their life, its feel shamelessly manipulative and cliché (which end up with unintentional hilarious macho-bonding thing between two lead characters). In fact, an intermission when Brandon visit his comrade who is simply beyond crippled (lose one leg, one arm and two eyes) is more touching than everything else in the movie.<br/><br/>If the cast will make you drool (especially girls), you're not alone. Stop-Loss packed with ""next best thing"" casts. But only Ryan Phillippe is worth watching (probably the most mature role of his career to date). Brandon is an important character, since he is a centerpiece to the story. It required him to show a lot of layers, anger, frustration, etc. And the good thing is Ryan knew his character so well and did a very good job (by the scene he beat up thieves who stole his belonging, I entirely bought his character already). On the other hand, there's too limited time for Channing and Joseph to start doing something mesmerizing like their leading actor. I don't know that it would be an improvement or not, but it would be really nice if they decide to share an equal screen time for those three young actors.<br/><br/>""Stop-Loss"" is yet another anti-war drama like its predecessor (In the Valley of Elah, Rendition, Redacted) that didn't really break into a major audience. I don't really know why those movies weren't successful in United State (in term of box office). My guess (since I'm obviously not one of those people in that ""The greatest nation in da world"") is they might fed up with the whole war things that they've seen in the media every single day. So why should bother go seeing another one on a big screen? Well, let's just say I'm glad that I'm not thinking about it like them."

Isn't the whole idea that it is unlawful for the president to yank them back? <br/><br/>The following review, then, is for the film in a world which Stop-loss is unlawful...<br/><br/>This film has two problems, but I did enjoy it. It got my heart involved, which is what a good film is suppose to do. One of the things anyway. I cared. The story made sense. I felt for those guys. The camera is too close on everyone from the very beginning, which forces the images and people down the viewer's throats instead of keeping back a bit and letting us get to know the characters before we can accept them at so close a level. This is important for a filmmaker to get, because, well, it's important. All great directors understand this. The hand-held stuff is a bit overdone, and needed to find its place.<br/><br/>You can't really blame the screenwriter for the ending, but let's blame them anyway. Can't blame them because it is feasible, but, isn't art suppose to seek some higher truth? Isn't that the point, after all, and not just settle for what is? After looking the Rico Rodriguez character in his eyes and shaking his hand Sgt. King still goes back to war. Hm. Feasible, but not really art.

","I gave this movie a 2 solely for the effort they exerted to try and disguise this propaganda as a movie. I'll explain. Most folks, when they enlist in the Armed Forces, sign up for 8 years. You heard me correctly: usually 4 Active Duty, then 4 in the IRR. With that said, the very premise of this movie is ridiculous. This movie is about as accurate as ""Basic"" was. The only thing these two movies have in common with reality is they make occasional references to actual places. That's it. After watching this movie, I've surmised that, upon returning from deployment, everyone has their fiancé leave them, gets a DWI, or becomes a fugitive. I'm so uplifted. I have such confidence in our men and women in uniform now. Jeeze... All in all, this is one you can definitely skip. I don't know who directed it, but after watching it, I assume it was Michael Moore. I know it isn't a documentary and wasn't meant to be one, but what was the purpose of putting those numbers up at the end right before the credits? It reminded me of ""Blood Diamonds"". If you're going to connect actual events to this fictitious story, what's the motive? My guess: ""to expose a grave injustice that's going on as we speak."" Be sure to read that last line with a snooty, self-important tone to get the intended effect. I'll end by saying: 1. Did anyone FORCE our men and women to sign the enlistment papers? 2. Is it common practice for people to sign contracts without reading them, or is the movie implying that all soldiers are too stupid to read? 3. Doesn't everyone know by now that America is engaged in a ""War on Terror"", and wouldn't it be obvious to anyone enlisting that, just perhaps, enlisting could lead to deployment? 4. When did serving your country become a bad thing? 5. Why did Hollywood make this piece of trash into a movie? This movie sucked more than Paris Hilton."

","On the day he is to be honorably discharged from the service, decorated army Sergeant Brandon King is ordered to return to duty in Iraq, the latest victim of ""stop-loss,"" a term for when soldiers who have fulfilled the terms of their military contract are denied permission to leave the service under penalty of court martial and imprisonment. Brandon, caught emotionally off-guard by the news, impulsively decides to go AWOL, leaving his fellow troops to head back to the Middle East without him. Brandon becomes a fugitive from justice, as much on the run from the memories that haunt him as from the authorities looking to bring him back.<br/><br/>A searing expose on the ""backdoor draft,"" ""Stop-Loss"" is an extraordinarily powerful drama that shows how men and women who have bravely served their country on the field of battle (along with the loved ones they have left behind) are being betrayed by the very government they fought to defend. Yet, ""Stop-Loss"" is no star-turn polemic like ""Lions for Lambs,"" but, rather, an intensely personal drama that illuminates its issue in starkly human terms. The grim realities of post-war trauma - both physical and psychological - are vividly dramatized in the persons of Brandon and his buddies, all of whom have returned to their small Texas town radically changed men. But the film is also about that special sense of camaraderie and group cohesion that develops among soldiers who have fought side by side under hellish circumstances - and the lifelong bond that results.<br/><br/>Despite the wide-ranging nature of the theme, writer/director Kimberley (""Boys Don't Cry"") Peirce and co-writer Mark Richard keep the drama modest in scope and intimate in scale. It's true that there are times when the screenplay threatens to fall victim to its own contrivance, but the quality of performance and authenticity of detail always bring the movie back into line.<br/><br/>Long a fine but under-appreciated actor, Ryan Philippe truly comes into his own in this film, delivering a performance of such raw truth and emotional complexity that we literally cannot takes our eyes off him for the duration of the movie. Ditto for Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Victor Rasuk, all equally superb as men who served alongside Brandon in Iraq and who now have their own personal, war-related demons to wage battle against. Abbie Cornish is also excellent as the friend who accompanies Brandon on his panic-stricken flight across the country.<br/><br/>There are those who will object to ""Stop-Loss"" on strictly political grounds, seeing it as yet another anti-war diatribe designed to make the Bush administration look bad. Yet, the film transcends politics, honoring the bravery and valor of the soldiers while reserving the right to question the wisdom and morality of those in power who would send these fine young men on such a fool's errand in the first place - and then insist on doing it over and over again. I frankly can't imagine anything more pro-American or pro-troop than that."

"bigredone-4","1","4","10","10 October 2009"," A story of a deserter
","After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself against disappointed in Hollywood for making such a stinker. Gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an American, fighting the evilness that desires conquest abroad and death at home. What we are left with is dribble frothing at the mouth of rabid anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men who return home from the war. One descends into out-of-control madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist deserts his country at a time of war, and destroys his best friends relationship with his fiancé at the same time. The third truly is the hero of the story, electing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores nearly eight years ago. What makes this movie bad, is not the acting, but the premise behind it. We are lead to believe that decorated soldiers are in fact haters of our country. Desertion is akin to treason in a time of war, and the main protagonist flirts with it throughout the movie. This paradox is designed to weaken the audience's reaction to the central act of the movie. We are not supposed to find fault with King, since he wears medals, but his actions don't just merit it, but cry out for it. He is not an anti-hero. In order to accept the movie, the audience must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints King as nothing else short of a hero. I cannot accept that, since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day. Furthermore, derision for the real hero is heaped upon, the man who re-enlists and continues to serve his country. I would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the decay of Hollywood, as it is a clear example of it. No wonder it fared poorly in the box office."

"jaredmobarak","8","4","10","29 March 2008"," Read the cards ShortyStop-Loss
","Kimberly Peirce's Stop-Loss is the perfect example of a film that can show whether you like the medium or the stories. I think I can tell myself that I am a true film fanatic after watching this because I thought it was a great piece of work. I've come to this conclusion because while I would see it again and recommend it to friends, I cannot condone one iota of it. It is blatantly anti-war, anti-American, and probably the worst thing that can happen in the US right now. Moral in the war and the troops cannot be helped at all with this very message-driven story. Despite all that, though, I really enjoyed my time with these characters despite how vain and selfish they are. The emotions are real and Peirce shows once again how authentic she can make the South look and feel with a nice rendering of Texas.<br/><br/>Despite all those personal reservations and the fact that this film could damage people's outlooks on a war they already don't agree with, as an entry to the world of cinema, it is very effective. I would compare it to The Deer Hunter in its portrayal of wartime clichés without making them feel forced or stereotypical, (not for being even close to the masterpiece that Vietnam movie is, but I could call this an MTV generation's version). We have the newly weds rejoining after a tour of duty and the hardships that entails, we have the injured soldier banished to a wheelchair and a life of blindness, the soldier so taken out of reality that being a soldier is all he knows, and the entire group suffering from mild to extreme Gulf War Syndrome on full display. Credit Peirce for showing it all realistically and somewhat sympathetically, never wholly to manipulate the audience, but instead to just tell the story she wanted to tell. Her directing style is effective as well, from the hand-held look and feel of the alley ambush at the start, the grainy home-film of the troops letting off steam during downtime, to the dark close-ups following the group around back in America. For those intense scenes of violence she deftly cuts in footage from Iraq with what is happening on screen. The sequence with Phillippe and the thieves who stole Abbie Cornish's purse is very memorable. Both from the choreography and brutality as well as the reverting back to his Sergeant self, engaging an enemy that is manifested in his mind. Peirce's only misstep is with the concealing of an event back in Iraq upon Phillippe saving Channing Tatum. To show this scene towards the end of the movie, a scene so out of the blue because it was never alluded to before, was blatant manipulation. She was doing so well at allowing everything to happen on course, until she spliced that harrowing moment to make us hate the war even more. The whole movie could be seen as manipulating the truth, but that instance was the one that made me angry.<br/><br/>A big part of my enjoyment, though, is in the fantastic acting by a strong troupe of young thespians. Emotions run high throughout, from extreme happiness to the depths of utter pain and sorrow. The two characters we spend the most time with are Phillippe and Cornish. He is really amazing in his portrayal of the leader in the field and off it. His ability to diffuse the situations cropping up with his friends and soldiers is well played. The slow devolution of his façade that everything is all right is also great. He is the one with his head on straight, but when pushed against a wall, the psyche shows its imperfections. Kudos to Victor Rasuk as Rico. His outlook on the life he must lead from now on was an interesting thing to see. The juxtaposition of his injuries to the smile and disposition talking with his friend is tough to assimilate. War is most definitely hell, and I liked the lingering shot of him as his two visitors leave the room; his realization and snap back to the reality of being in that bed alone with only his memories of a full life that was there for the taking.<br/><br/>My favorites, however, are Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Channing Tatum. Gordon-Levitt has made a name for himself playing the troubled young adult dealing with inner demons. There is a lot of his character from Manic here as he attempts to reconcile his feelings of relief and happiness to be home with those of hatred and revenge in wanting to go back to the Middle East to cause havoc. Tatum, on the other hand, was a big surprise. I guess when given a role that doesn't entail dancing or pretending to be an athlete, the guy can bring some talent to the table. As the one who sees a future for himself in the army, unsure whether to pursue it or to stay with the people he promised five years prior, he shows the conflict and inability to be the person he wants to be and the one they want at the same time. All his feelings towards Phillippe for his abandonment are true and I feel the only thing that is at all times real. This character is what kept me from completely writing the film off as anti-war propaganda. He knew his job and saw what fighting the law could do to those close to him. He must watch the world implode while his best friend leaves him to clean up his mess. It's a turn that I wasn't quite sure he had in him and maybe will make me buy into some of his hype."

That is not the question here, but of our soldiers from states such as Texas who enlist and want to ""make a difference"" for their country and who now face a deadly enemy out to destroy them, maim them and send them back to the United States in coffins.

"dead47548","9","4","11","7 April 2008"," A devastating character study; not a war film.
","Last year, the film industry produced a series of Iraq-war based films that flopped immensely at the box office. Stop-Loss appears to be no different, and that's a true shame because this one actually deserves praise and deserves to be a success; because it's brilliant. Films like Lions for Lambs or In the Valley of Elah dealt with conspiracy in the government and the politics of the war, or the battles happening over there. With this the films try to strike an emotional chord with audiences who have no experience in the war; people who aren't soldiers but may be related to them or have no real connection to the war whatsoever. But in doing so they develop a cold, unemotional feeling that I can't get over and disables me from making any kind of emotional connection to the characters and as a result I end up disliking the film.<br/><br/>Stop-Loss couldn't be more different and that's why it succeeds so admirably. Its name is derived from a horrific injustice that's being used on soldiers (a sort of backdoor draft which allows the military to send soldiers back into combat after they've completed their military contract) but the actual use of stop-loss is just the motivation to get the plot going. Not to say that this tactic the military employs is taken lightly in the film. Director Kimberly Peirce hits us hard with the tragic, dirty-handed use of force that the military uses but its effect on the soldiers takes a backseat to the torturous experience of trying to get back to their life after fighting through the horrors of war. The film focuses primarily on three soldiers and all three men have their own wrenching story about trying to cope with life after the war.<br/><br/>The film opens up in Iraq as an attack on a group of soldiers leads a chase scene through a barren city and into a narrow alley. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) leads these soldiers into the alley, where an ambush strikes them. The next few minutes are some of the most wrenching, horrifying moments of war I've seen on screen. A grenade rolls into the alley and Rico Rodriguez (Victor Rasuk) dives to protect one of his fellow soldiers. As a result, half of his skin is burnt severely and eventually he loses his right arm and right leg. Brandon scrambles to get control of the situation and protect his men, but the chaos is too much. Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) sees his best friend take a bullet in the jaw and another in the neck. He snaps and picks up a machine gun and starts taking down everyone he sees on the rooftops attacking him. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum) follows an attacker into a building, despite Brandon's warning. A few moments later we hear him calling for help and Brandon quickly storms in. Brandon saves Steve but not after killing a few innocent civilians (including a woman and some children) with two grenades, whose only crime was living with a man who attacked these soldiers. Later on in the film, we find out that an event even more traumatic occurred while Brandon walked Steve out of the blood-stained building.<br/><br/>Soon after when they return home, Brandon finds that he has more problems than dealing with the trauma of his friends. He reports to turn in his gear to the military and is stunned to find that he is assigned to report back to duty at the end of the month. When he complains to his higher-up, he ends up being escorted to military prison to wait until he is shipped back. Thinking on his feet, Brandon takes down the two men escorting him, finds Steve's jeep and drives off. He is officially AWOL. When he tells his family and Michelle what happens, they are also stunned and struggle thinking of what to do. Brandon remembers a Senator telling him that if he ever needs a favor, to ask him, and decides to head up to Washington D.C. to take the Senator up on his offer. Steve's fiancée Michelle (Abbie Cornish) offers to drive with him, knowing that Steve is likely to suffer from stop-loss as well. So off they go on a road trip to try and stop this cruelty to soldiers.<br/><br/>This film is getting hit with more insults about being just another 'anti-war' or 'anti-Iraq film'. Due to these claims, it's going to fail at the box office just like every other film labeled with that title has. The tragic thing about that is the fact that this film really has little to do with Iraq. Peirce never implies whether she is for or against the war and none of the characters do. She criticizes the government's use of the stop-loss technique, but whether you support the war or not it is quite clear that what they are doing to these men is so wrong that it should be criminal. This film is an incredibly devastating character study focused around men who are torn apart mentally because of the war, but in doing that Peirce doesn't come out and say that the war is wrong. She says that stop-loss is wrong and that men who suffer from the war shouldn't be sent back there within a month of returning home. An impressive film that struck me deeply and still has me holding back tears when I think of it."

","11 April 2008. There are some good moments in this Anti-War movie but there are some technical problems and a less than superb script, plot. The MTV inserts at the beginning with musical video segments of the war seem more disruptive and unnecessary (at least to the older generation) and furthermore than fade out and aren't used in the last two-thirds of the movie. There are some editing problems, in at least two places (a brief shot of writing on a pad and the cut to father and then son later in the movie seems out of sync). The cinematography varies, especially at the beginning portion of the movie that don't seem to serve much purpose. There appears to be too much effort to dramatize and reduce the complexity of reality into various two-dimensional characters representative of several archetypes of the sick and wounded coming out of the Iraq conflict. And the ending is perhaps too pat or too conveniently American. Nevertheless through out the movie there are some strong scenes, some riveting experiences of the conflict in Iraq and at home. The relationships in the movie are decent, especially the female/male relationships handled much more realistic than most movies. Unfortunately, this movie never quit offers up enough character development, relational backstory, and for the ending enough of an understanding explanation that is instead sort of the cop-out twist ending that fails to really satisfy. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","Kimberley Peirce's (Boys Don't Cry) movie proved to be controversial in military circles. The story is about the stop-loss procedure used by the American military, a kind of small print tactic that can extend a soldiers service should their country deem it so. Sergeant Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) returns home from the Gulf Wars with his mentally scarred pals fully expecting to get back to a domestic life without blood and brains dominating his personal landscape. Yet he is called back in for another tour of Iraq under the stop-loss procedure, something he rebels against and goes AWOL. He has done two tours already, surely he has earned his retirement?<br/><br/>It starts off in electrified fashion, the horrors of the war in Iraq bursting from the screen as a firefight ensues, character traits are introduced to us, we are left in no doubt that the soldiers at the end of this tour of duty have seen it all. Pic then settles into a sort of cross between a road movie and a PTSD portrait awash with emotional strangulation. Peirce and her co-writer Mark Richard have honourable intentions, but too much is given over to stereotyping, of stock clichés and the bold signposting of character's futures. They carefully paint King as a model soldier, this is definitely not about cowardice, but come the cop-out finale it's evident that the narrative suffers glaring inconsistencies and confused messaging.<br/><br/>On the bonus side is the performances of the youthful cast, where some fluctuating accents aside, Phillippe, Channing Tatum and Abbie Cornish are superb, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt makes a weakly written part crackle with pained emotion. Of the elders, most are underwritten, which is a shame when you got the likes of Ciaran Hinds in the cast. We are left as a whole with a film that is as uneven as a dusty road in Tikrit, not only in narrative structure, but also in actual facts as regards the procedures of the American military, both on the written documents and execution of duty in battle.<br/><br/>It was a flop at the American box-office and it's not hard to see why, but it still has merits. Even as the familiarity tries to breed contempt, the anguished reality of a soldiers life, during tours and post service time, strikes a mightily distressing chord. 6.5/10"
"johnnyboyz","6","0","0","29 August 2011"," Easy to label ""Born of the Fourth of July for the X-Box generation""; but it's an ample enough film with some things to say on some tough issues born out of war.
","Stop-Loss slots nicely into a canon of films populated by 'issue' pieces dealing with the war in the Middle East, or on Terror; a film looking at, as the following year's Rendition did with the detainment rights America seemingly has on terror suspects, the titular 'stop-loss' policy - a ruling forcing veterans back out to the Gulf front lines for more tours of duty against their wishes and against prior agreements with the government. It additionally comes to strike us as the sort of film designed to habituate your more younger adult viewers on the issue of war, warfare and the war in The Middle East; that wars and warfare carry with them side effects, that explosions and wartime hostilities carry with them a shrill price. Through what most would refer to as a process of trivialisation through that of the medium of computer games, and a general skirting around of certain issues, Stop-Loss feels designed to both unearth and bring to the forefront the backlog of hurt and bother that often arrives with what most of Stop-Loss' target audience may already perceive as a passive pursuit.<br/><br/>Where the film somewhat flails on the front of the former, and despite feeling like an unabashed 'awareness' piece, it succeeds in bringing attention to the latter; an involving enough documentation of the fallouts of war. In another sense, it did its job on the political front; I was unaware of the stop loss policy, what it entailed and how people might go about dealing with it if in disagreement. The film opens with a sequence of warfare I didn't expect to be as effective as it was. We witness a squad of Iraqi-based American soldiers fighting enemy soldiers still loyal to the causes that desire Western involvement banished from the territories. It is a skirmish that only really kicks off after several of the troops have risen to the bait of an armed man in a car at a checkpoint, whom then promptly leads the gung-ho soldiers into an enclosed street and an ambush. Bullets begin to fly, rockets are propelled and people are hurt in a locale somewhat passingly resembling your bog-standard online multi-player game arena.<br/><br/>For several men, it was the last happening of an arduous tour; several soldiers, as well as platoon leader Brandon King (Phillippe) and Channing Tatum's Steve Shriver, both of whom will later come to to contribute to the text more greatly, depart following the tour's termination and head to their home states. King's and Striver's is Texas. Once home, their surroundings are constructed as a somewhat sickly place of pro-war garb and patriotic singing; a place in which all the women are overtly photogenic and the young boys of the town idolise their newly arrived war heroes - director Kimberly Peirce even finds room for a composition of the American flag fluttering limply in the breeze. Suffice to say, the locals are over the moon to have their boys back; the post-tour celebratory party following an opening battle going along way to summarise the general outlook on the war as a whole: we're winning, we're taking heavy losses and a lot of Arabs local to the territories are dying for not an awful lot, but we're winning.<br/><br/>The homecoming is sweet on the surface to these people, and on the surface alone; odd behavioural patterns beginning to plague that of what Striver does thus upsetting his fiancé Michelle (Cornish) and forcing King into getting involved, the foul smell of post-traumatic stress disorder filling the air and filling the grounds of Striver's front lawn when the digging of fox holes in the dead of night as well as the persistent speaking to himself plays out. For King, problems rear up when he is a victim of that aforementioned stop-loss policy; a forcing of him back to the hotbeds of The Middle East against his wishes - an order devilishly delivered to him by a Lieutenant colonel played by Timothy Olyphant, whom always looks like he's having fun playing that seedy guy you're supposed to dislike but isn't necessarily the villain, and something that sees King, in his own words, ""screwed by the system"".<br/><br/>King takes it upon himself to just leave; a fugitive out on the road with that of Michelle since, y'know, she's prettier and will make for better company than that of his parents. Where the film goes is into the realms of where films such as these, ranging from Taxi Driver to Borne on the Fourth of July, often go; that is to say, a physical journeying that will open the lead's eyes to a ""real"" America of stuff they'd previously been somewhat oblivious to. Their cross-country travelling on this occasion sees them journey to Washington D.C., so as to try and garner some help from a senator whom was as kind as you like when King's tour was still fresh in the memory, but then seems totally disinterested. It plods and it waves proverbial flags, but it does the job; along the way, we anticipate King and Michelle's romance - her patching up of his wounds following a brawl an obligatory 'coming-together' moment of a sensual and physical sort. Peirce finds room to rear up the shocking nature of your more decrepit veterans: an excursion to a military hospital dealing with those whom lost limbs and such arriving as further issue-baiting which clunks into proceedings rather than slots neatly. Stop-Loss is not without merit, and surprised me in how far is was willing to go in its politics; it's tough to begrudge the film, and its air of ambiguity as to whether it's a film glorifying the running from's one duty or the standing tall for what one believes in is good value, but I suspect the director has a better film up her sleeve and as far as the War on Terror canon goes, you could do a lot better yourself."

","Stop-Loss is quite a controversial movie. It's not your regular war movie. It has few scenes which the story happens in Iraq, but mainly it goes in US where the soldiers have returned from the mission. They are trying to conflate back to civilian life which actually seems harder than going through battles back in the far east. It's intriguing because the movie has a point against the government system which has a fail spot. But for me, what I really enjoyed, was the story more important than the vital factor for which the movie wanted to point the finger to.<br/><br/>I liked the cast. Young and talented actors such as Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt give all good performances. And also we got good-looking Abbie Cornish. Stand-out performance - Joseph Gordon-Levitt.<br/><br/>I suggest to see the movie because of its talent. You see the future and probably you like it."

Very charming and unusual.<br/><br/>The one scene that bothered me was when Brandon was on the ground getting kicked by 3 guys then gets up and kicks their asses. That's unrealistic and might convince some young nut to JOIN the army (to learn to fight) rather than run in the other direction. I had an experience with ""An Officer And A Gentleman"" when I was young and stupid where I wound up at the recruiters the next day and, fortunately, didn't sign when common sense prevailed. Some of these films (like ""Top Gun"") may be subtle recruitment films that draw enlisters for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The scene I DID love was when Phillipe and Cornish left Rodriguez and the smile on his face dropped away and we realized he was giving us a positive spin on a worse than lousy situation.<br/><br/>Interesting that they cast Timothy Oliphant as the charming Sarge who brings in enlisters, employing friendship and charm rather than the realities of war.<br/><br/>Then the excellent fight in the cemetery with independent thinker Brandon versus ""bought the brainwashing"" Steve who just doesn't get it.

","There is no loss of masculinity testosterone in the Iraq War theme film ""Stop-Loss"". It stars cinematic heartthrobs Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, and Joseph Gordon Levitt. Director Kimberly Peirce's poignant ""peirce of work"" on the mental psyche of the American soldier post Iraq combat duty is probably the best of the platoon of Iraqi movies so far; even though I still have not unlocked and checked out the critically acclaimed ""The Hurt Locker"". In ""Stop-Loss""- Phillippe stars as Sgt. Brandon King, a multiple-duty served soldier who returns to his Texas hometown after his last tour only to discover a short time after that he has been ""stop-lossed"" to serve once again. Undoubtedly, King is at a loss for words on hearing the disastrous news but nothing is going to stop him to evade another Iraqi nightmare. Therefore, he decides to win the ""stop-loss"" AWOL style by taking a road trip to seek assistance from a U.S. Senator to the nation's capital. King's travel companion is childhood female friend Michelle, tenderly played by the breakthrough-verging Abbie Cornish. Tatum portrays Sgt. Steve Shriver, King's best friend and soldier peer. Shriver is willing to reenlist to serve once more even though he has not completed his ""tour of boyfriend duty"" to his impatient girlfriend, the aforementioned ""She is Michelle"". The steady Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the third soldier hometown amigo Tommy Burgess who goes AWOL on his own mental state and not to mention liver by taking aim at the liquor lifestyle. I do commend Peirce for her magnificent cerebral architecture of the mental battle of the postwar American soldier. Even though I do feel that scriber Mike Richard's formulaic screenplay needed some more ingenious verbal-creative firepower. Phillippe's vastly improving acting continued to step up the thespian hierarchy with his commanding performance as Sgt. King. Tatum also followed his acting orders to the ""tee"" with his striking work as Shriver, and Gordon-Levitt continues to be one of Hollywood's bright young stars with another superb performance. And Dear Abbie Cornish: Simply keep doing what you are doing. I was also surprisingly flabbergasted with Victor Rasuk's sensitive performance as the war-afflicted handicapped Pvt. Rico Rodriguez. Cinematographer Chris Menges was a man at war with his gripping imminent camera-work. ""Stop-Loss"" was not a masterful major cinematic winner but definitely not in the war loss film category. **** Good"
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","0","17 June 2009"," Read the small print...
","Your natural inclination is to sympathise with Ryan Phillippe's character when he learns on the day he expects to be leaving the military that he is to be drummed back into the middle of the conflict in Iraq instead. As they say, he should have read the small print, but it's easy to believe that the majority of young men who sign up to serve their country fail to give the documents they're signing more than a cursory glance.<br/><br/>The film follows a fairly routine path, peopled by predictably 'divergent' characters whose mental scars affect them in different ways but, once it moves beyond the somewhat stomach-churning homecoming parade, manages to keep the viewer's interest. Although Philippe, Gordon-Levitt and Tatum all give decent performances as the messed-up returning heroes it's Gordon-levitt who makes the biggest impression thanks to the more understated manner of his performance. Philippe is miscast but manages the role well.<br/><br/>The film is careful not to criticise outright the stop-loss clause that allows the military to send former soldiers back to the battlefield, which means that any message it tries to convey is confused to say the least, a flaw which is then exacerbated by the fact that, late on in the film, it suggests that Philippe's character isn't rebelling against the recall because it is inherently wrong but because he is suffering a crisis of confidence and guilt after leading his men into an ambush on their last mission."

","Honestley I believe this story wholeheartedly, and I know people like this in my city. I'm from Evansville Indiana and I know rednecks just like this from there so those of you that say that the acting was bad back off from that unless your from Texas or somewhere where you know people like this. But regardless of that I'm not a big political person and the sad fact of that is a lot of soldiers aren't either. When most soldiers sign up for duty I think that they think that they are fighting for there country and don't really realize what it is they are out there for. When Ryan Phillipe's character said that he signed up to get back for 9/11 and found out that wasn't what it was about it really hit home for me. Soldier's for the most part don't know what exactly , they are there risking they're lives, possibly killing innocent families, risking they're crews and friends life, despite being ignorant of what, exactly they are fighting for. The acting in this film is excellent, many think it's not because the characters get on your nerves. to be honest with you, all the characters got on my nerves. But I can say first hand that this movie is one of the most realistic and legitimate films of are current political situations. Many will say it gives an ignorant point of view, but that's the point of view it's supposed to give from the soldiers. The only part in the film that I don't know firsthand is the major part of Stop-Loss The fact that ryan Phillipe's character was an excellent soldier and sergeant and was supposed to go home but was sent back to Iraq. This is why if you know soldiers it is very sad to me. If he didn't go back he automatically became a fugitive... this is absurd to me. But it's probably real. It's like he robbed a convenience store or something. I'm just saying, if somebody was a cop and just wanted to quit after he was trying to save people on 9/11, are you seriously going to incarcerate him? This movie made me think of things like that. This movie will not entertain everybody even though it's far from boring. It's far from cliché because even though I thought that I saw the twists coming and the predictable romantic undertow coming I have to say that this is for soldiers and families of soldiers."

Fellow cadet Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is facing a divorce and an alcohol problem, and Steve is battled with nightmares and anger issues. Meanwhile, Brandon also faces his demons as he realizes he too has been changed by the ravages of war.<br/><br/>Sure, this is another political war movie (like ""In the Valley of Elah,"" ""Lions for Lambs"" and ""Rendition""), but it's got a strong cast and a solid script which draws the viewer in like never before. Yes, it does center around the negative aspects of war, but it also eventually shows the value of serving in the army and fighting for freedom overseas."
"EXodus25X","8","0","0","8 July 2008"," Stop-Loss, how much would that suck!
","Ryan Phillippe continues to impress me, as of late he has chosen great roles and given even better performances. He is most definitely on the very verge of becoming one of the great actors of today. The film itself is an emotional look into the lives of these soldiers and their families and confronts some very serious issues and questions of our times. It is at times powerful and emotional, none more then in it's final scene, a scene which is sheer perfection in it's inevitability and simplicity. Even in a smaller supporting role Joseph Gordon-Levitt shines and is easily one of the most underused and under-appreciated talents in Hollywood. As for Channing Tatum he delivers the performance of his life, unfortunately that's not saying much, I would hope he would use this to spring board to consistently better material from here on out because he has shown he is capable to take on things bigger then Step-Up. The ""girl"" in this film, not her personally but her character seems like a waste, a girl thrown in like in so many other films just for the sake of having a girl, adds nothing to the large amount of screen time that she wastes. Even though at times this film does take a political stand on some issues, I was glad that they didn't go full bore down one way or the other. I think the missing side to this story and to so many of films of this kind is simply this, not every person that comes back from war are all screwed up, plenty of men and women go on to live a normal lives after seeing combat. Not every person that goes off to war has no other choice but to go, it is not only under privileged kids that can't hope for anything better. There are plenty of men and women who choose this life out of a feeling of duty and take it on with honor, who are committed to fighting for this country and the freedoms it allows us. To them we should simply say thank you. Hollywood's movies consistently imply that nothing good comes from war and at times they are right, but at times like now when the sons and daughters of America are overseas fighting, maybe we should spend a little less time debating the war and a little more praying for our soldiers and their safe return and for God to grant wisdom to our countries leadership."

The true underlying theme to this movie is friendship, camaraderie and doing the right thing in the face of evil or horrible circumstances.<br/><br/>This movie will draw on some strong emotions and it's truly not a feel-good movie, but I think it's worth the watch anyway. Most of the actors in this film were OK, but Channing Tatum was wonderful, even though he wasn't on the screen as much as I'd like.

","I saw this movie in theatres when it first came out.

It was saying things like how the Inactive Reserves was a sortof ""back door draft""<br/><br/>At the end of the movie this lady said very loudly and confidently ""thars right, thats absolutely right."" For some reason that memory stuck in my head, i coupdnt put my finger on it, but i knew that there was something not accurate about the whole situation.<br/><br/>Had i known then what i know now i would have corrected her. As i sit here writing this in my separation class (on my lunch break) as a member of the US Navy we were previously going over the details of the inactive reserve and that memory of this movie that i saw 11 years ago came to mind and i felt compelled to write about it.<br/><br/>The Inactive Reserves is NOT a backdoor draft. At all. When you enlist you are informed day 1 about the Inactive Reserves and what it means.<br/><br/>Yes, a person who enlists, signs up for a contract of active duty time as well as Inactive duty time.. realistically it is an 8 year contract. Keep in mind they tell you this before you even sign up...it is absolutely not some backdoor draft that blindsides you out of nowhere like the movie makes it out to be.<br/><br/>The person enlisting signs up knowing fully aware of what he is getting himself into. And still makes the conscious decision to do so. If the main character was not ok with the chance of being recalled, he should not have signed up in the first place end of story.<br/><br/>When you look at this movie as a propaganda tool it becomes difficult to take the movie seriously. The main character becomes unrelatable and i just cant feel sorry about some guy who is going through everything when he signed up for it in the first place."

","After serving a particularly brutal tour in Iraq, SSgt. Ryan Phillippe (as Brandon King) returns to his Texas town. An honorary parade welcomes Mr. Phillippe. Bathed in red, white, and blue, Phillippe collects both a Bronze Star and Purple Heart. After the big parade, Phillippe celebrates civilian life with two also-returning Army buddies, model Channing Tatum (as Steve Shriver) and actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt (as Tommy Burgess). Coming home proves difficult for Mr. Tatum and Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who drink excessively and abuse their mates; they are likely experiencing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.<br/><br/>Phillippe falls into his leadership position, and helps his pals adjust. Then, just before his official discharge, Phillippe is ordered back to Iraq, thanks to a (then) largely unknown Army contract clause known as ""Stop-Loss"". Assisted by soldier Tatum's beautiful fiancée, Abbie Cornish (as Michelle), Phillippe takes off for Washington, DC, to ask for a politician's help. Of course, there is no possibility of reversal - Phillippe must either be jailed as AWOL, or return to active duty.<br/><br/>Director Kimberly Peirce, who last scored with ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999), really should be working more often. ""Stop-Loss"" is an excellent film, with extraordinary photography (Chris Menges), lighting, locations, and performances. The documentary-style ""hand-held camera"" technique is overused; but, there is enough stillness when dramatically required. The politics of ""Stop-Loss"" is told from the soldier protagonist's point-of-view; whether you agree or not, it is a feeling widely held, and deserved to be told.<br/><br/>Although the film is ostensibly about Iraq, and includes a convincing sequence in the war-torn country, the real surprise is how the filmmakers' portray the American landscape. You see rural and urban gunplay, highways and byways, dark alleys, cheap diners, and seedy motels. The early patriotic parade and a later funeral are beautifully shot, with the United States flag extraordinarily photographed. ""Stop-Loss"" is really ""Desolation Row"" - it is not about Iraq; rather, it is about the United States of America, during a bleak, hopeless period.<br/><br/>********* Stop-Loss (3/13/08) Kimberly Peirce ~ Ryan Phillippe, Abbie Cornish, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt"
"ruben_conner93","8","1","2","2 January 2009"," Stop-Loss stopped me for a second...
","Stop-Loss is a movie that will change your opinion on it. Not only is the acting incredible but the characters are well-developed and they keep the story going and actually, make you feel what they feel. To be honest, it made me stop and think at the end of the movie how I take my life for granted when soldiers are over someplace else risking their lives for me. I highly recommend this movie to any channing tatum or ryan phillippe fans because they really showed what they can do far as acting. And keep a lookout for Joseph Gordon-Levitt- the last thing I saw him in was 3rd rock from the sun and he did an excellent job in this movie. He may be one of the rarest actors of his time! But overall, this movie is a great depiction of how war is and what our soldiers go through. We should really thank them for going out there to fight for us when we're at home sleeping and not worrying about anything, and they are at a foreign place fighting for their lives and for our freedom. Anyways, I give this movie a A+ because it was really awesome!!! And not to be offensive, but to be directed by a woman... thats really good. She has a heart for our soldiers I think from this film and really wanted this message to get across. STOP-LOSS is a film that will make you cry, laugh, and cry."
"TxMike","Null","1","2","5 August 2008"," What happens when you don't get discharged when you expect?
","In the military, STOP LOSS, means extending a military person in the Guard or Reserves, or on active duty, beyond what their normal separation date would be.<br/><br/>Those who join the military agree to this provision under paragraph 9c of the enlistment contract states: ""In the event of war, my enlistment in the Armed Forces continues until six (6) months after the war ends, unless my enlistment is ended sooner by the President of the United States."" <br/><br/>The Department of Defense maintains that the term ""war"" means anytime America's Armed Forces are engaged in hostile conflict, and not just ""war declared by Congress."" <br/><br/>And that is the theme of this movie. We see a drive-by shooting in Iraq that turns out to be an ambush when the car stops in an alley. Most survive but not all do, under the leadership of SSgt. Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe). When he and his men return home to Texas, they know it is also time for their discharge from the Army. But instead King is ""stop lossed"" and he has much difficulty dealing with it.<br/><br/>The 20-minute DVD extra with the writer/director (of 'Girls Don't Cry' fame) is very interesting, as she interviewed quite a number of men and women who were in Iraq, some affected by the ""stop loss"" clause. She sought to make this fictional story as real as possible, not to make a political statement on the ""right"" or ""wrong"" of the situations, but to describe it from the soldier's point of view, and some difficult choices they have to make.<br/><br/>Abbie Cornish is good as King family friend Michelle, engaged to one of the men, Channing Tatum as Sgt. Steve Shriver. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Tommy Burgess, Rob Brown is Isaac 'Eyeball' Butler.<br/><br/>Timothy Olyphant is effective as Lt. Col. Boot Miller, whom King must answer to.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: King is determined to avoid extending his enlistment. He first tries to go to Washington with a naive belief his congressman can help, then he decides to see a NY lawyer who can get him a new identity and situate him in Canada. Eventually however King and his family end up near the Mexican border and, when he considers what his life would be away from all that the knew and loved, he relented, and reported for duty and deployment back to Iraq."

","The title of this film STOP-LOSS may puzzle many. According to Wikipedia, 'Stop-loss, in the United States military, is the involuntary extension of a service member's active duty service under the enlistment contract in order to retain them beyond their initial end of term of service (ETS) date. It also applies to the cessation of a permanent change of station (PCS) move for a member still in military service'. According to writer (with Mark Richard)/director Kimberly Pierce (whose previous 'Boy's Don't Cry' tackled similarly volatile issues), the impetus for making this film about the effects of war on veterans returning home was her viewing of videos taken by soldiers while actively engaged in battle in Iraq: this is the first war where the soldiers have actually photographed their own experiences, documenting the realities/horrors of war on the now popular video equipment at their disposal. It is a solid idea for a film, but somehow the idea gets diluted in the script. <br/><br/>Texas homeboys who have just returned from the Iraq war are greeted with a parade and medals and empty rhetoric, but find adapting to reentry into their native land is fraught with the deeply embedded mental wounds of their experience: interpersonal relationships fall apart, families face altered personalities in their sons, Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome reigns. Brandon (Ryan Phillippe) blames himself for the deaths of his men, Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) drinks himself toward suicide, Rico (Victor Rasuk) attempts to see past his traumatically missing limbs, Isaac (Rob Brown) finds his entire world out of focus, and Steve (Channing Tatum) sees the military as his only point of reality to a life of success. When Brandon receives his Stop-Loss instead of his discharge papers his world turns upside down and he flounders in his nightmares and his need for escape to Canada or Mexico with his friend Michelle (Abbie Cornish). The horror of events that follow the homecoming of these damaged soldiers culminates in a tragedy that somehow results in the soldiers following the orders of the governmental Stop-Loss orders. And that is the worst tragedy. <br/><br/>Though the message is important, the delivery of it gets hazy: the motivations of the characters are too loosely defined to convince us of their terrible plights. But the impact on the public should be a wake-up call on the extended damage of war - any war- on the men and women who experience it first hand and carry the mental scars for life. For that reason, if for no other, this is a film that should be seen. Grady Harp"
"x_d0rk1e","5","2","7","9 April 2008"," Was this a joke?
","This was a great idea for a movie...gone wrong. Kimberley, what happened? You went from Boys Don't Cry to Stop-Loss?<br/><br/>I would first like to praise this movie for what it was worth. First, I love how the director and write depicted what a soldier goes through after getting out from an army. That was dead-on. They convey the emotions, the disillusionment, and the tension one causes when exiting a war. Second, I would like to say that this was a great plot. I did not know about the term ""stop-loss"" until this movie, and it infuriates me. Scene after scene, my head was starting to blow up. It really brought to my attention the problems we have in our military system.<br/><br/>Now for the critiques... I would first like to say something about the writing. Although it was good in portraying the emotions, the logic of the character was extremely skewed. First of all, he chose Mexico over Canada? Are you kidding? You're choosing a third world country over a developed country! And at the end, after wasting $1,000, driving everywhere, and complaining for 2 hours, he decided to go back to the military. <br/><br/>Second, the directing was kind of poor. There was this one scene that pulled away from the realism of the piece. The main character was in New York, about to go to Canada, when all of a sudden he gets a phone call. One of his soldier buddy died. So on the day of his funeral, the main character showed up. How is that possible? You have no money, you have no car, you're on a motorcycle, and you get back JUST in time for the funeral? Also the scar wounds healed in two days, which made the whole movie even more fake.<br/><br/>Third, I want to comment about the acting. I would first like to say BRAVA to Joseph Gordon-Levitt for an amazing performance, once again. He portrayed his character to a T, and he did such an amazing job. Ryan Phillippee also did an great job. Not amazing, but he was pretty good. I still respect him as an actor, but he could have done better. Lastly, I want to complain about Channing Tatum. Where are the casting directors? They did a horrible job for casting him. He was auto-pilot the whole time. I didn't buy a thing he said, all he could do was scream and yell. His acting was laughable. The end scene when he broke down and ""cried"", was extremely laughable. When his ONE TEAR fell down from his eye was extremely fake. Did he use an eye drop? While Ryan is giving so much emotion in that scene, Channing is not giving anything back. <br/><br/>That's all I have to say about the movie. I do want people to watch it, so they know what the military does to us, but don't expect Oscars from this."
"andell","8","2","7","29 March 2008"," Perhaps more suited to TV, but a good movie all the same!
","After watching ""Stop-Loss,"" I noticed later in the day a commercial for it which indicated that this was produced by MTV films or something like that. I thought this was appropriate because while I watched ""Stop-Loss,"" I couldn't help but notice that this film really would've worked better on the small screen.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe plays the role of Brandon King, a young soldier who, after having served on over 150 missions in Iraq and seen the deaths of both the men under his command and civilians, is excited about the prospect of returning home after having done his duty for his country.<br/><br/>While turning in his gear and filing his paperwork, he is informed that he is to be shipped back to Iraq: although he has done his time and served his country, his Commander in Chief has the explicit right to unilaterally extend his tour without his knowledge or authorization.<br/><br/>Of course this isn't the only thing going on while the soldiers are back in the USA. Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) finds himself constantly in trouble as he battles alcohol addiction. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum), Brandon's best friend, returns to his girlfriend and assaults her while digging in a fox hole on their front lawn and arming himself with a handgun mere feet from a road where pedestrians and vehicles pass by.<br/><br/>It is on this level that I believe ""Stop-Loss"" ultimately fails. In the motion picture format, this story has to be constricted into 90 or 120 minutes, and as a result the focus is almost exclusively on Brandon. His outrage at having to report back to Iraq; his odyssey in traveling to meet a Senator who he thinks will help him get out; his coming into contact with many other Stop-Loss victims; his decision first to head for Canada, then Mexico, before he ultimately decides that he has to return to the military.<br/><br/>In the duration of the story, Steve goes from unstable to willing re-enlisting, though there's no perspective on this. As Tommy's life disintegrates, Steve tries to guilt Brandon into returning. Tommy is ultimately discharged, and commits suicide: the tragedy is effective, however without really allowing us to witness the back story here of the other characters, there is an artificial melodrama feel to it! I also must admit that, after initially feeling sympathy for Steve's precarious mental stability, I began to really dislike him in this story. He hits his girlfriend and really never apologizes for it- he merely says he couldn't remember it. He over and over again judges and tries to guilt Brandon into abandoning what he feels is justice, and then when Brandon comes to Tommy's grave to pay his respects, Steve assaults him! Steve has re-enlisted because he wanted to be a sniper where he could hit his targets from further away and be in less danger- he does this and ultimately sacrifices his fiancée (he never discussed it with her), and still at the end has the nerve to, when Brandon seems to extend the olive branch, seem rather indifferent.<br/><br/>I recommend the film rather strongly, but I feel like if it had been a TV movie, it would've really been something special!"

","Remember Rambo the first? The movie that detailed the way soldiers are treated when returning from war? They are out of place, they bring all this baggage with them that all civilians just want to put aside. In the meantime, the military wants that soldier back in their killing machine.<br/><br/>That's what this movie made me think of, although it was not Rambo-violent, just Rambo-ideological. Ryan Phillippe makes this movie even better, giving one of his best performances as yet. He is also changed physically, no longer just a pretty teenage boy, but a heavy muscled soldier man. If someone would have told me Ryan Phillippe would be good in the role of a Texan sergeant I would have laughed, but he made it fit like a glove.<br/><br/>I will let you see the film for yourself and make up your own mind. It is a great anti-war movie and a slap on the face of all those back-seat warmongers out there. I highly recommend it."

","Recap: After two tours in Iraq Staff Sergeant Brandon King is finally coming home and is leaving the army. With he has his friends that he served with, men that became as close as brothers, equally eager to quit fighting, equally happy to finally be close to dear ones. But the boys may be home, but they certainly haven't left the war behind. It is with them constantly, and each of them struggles with in their own way. They abuse drugs and alcohol and get into fights. It tear every relationship apart. Their wives and girlfriends can't handle them, the brotherhood between them comes under extreme pressure. So when King finds out that the army is about to Stop-Loss him, which means it won't let him quit and forcefully send him back to Iraq, Brandon feels betrayed. The army and government that he fought for, risked his life for, broke their deal. And he can't handle anymore death, more friends dying. He goes AWOL in a race for Washington, to speak with a senator, but he soon finds out that as fugitive, the list of friends quickly grows thin.<br/><br/>Comments: A strong movie about courage and duty, and doing the honorable thing. About how a government that has sent thousands of soldiers to fight a war on foreign soil, can turn their back on the same men once they returned home. How deals are broken, trust betrayed and the despair these men that is forced to rejoin can feel.<br/><br/>It is a strong movie about how it feels to return home with these horrible memories (at best) and not being able to handle them, the strain it puts on these individuals and their relationships.<br/><br/>Well, I have not been in any war, neither am I American, so the real issues might not be mine to debate, even if I do have a clear opinion about it. However, so does it seem this movie has. And it is very good at relaying it.<br/><br/>Ryan Philippe, Channing Tatum and Abbie Cornish gives very strong performances along with the rest of a strong cast. Their acting is reason enough to watch this movie, a real impressive effort.<br/><br/>It might be so that some of the events is not entirely realistic, however to dismiss the movie or the emotions that are portrayed in them because of that is foolish. It portrays a part of a war that both individuals and governments that send their soldiers to war need to handle. Therefore I think this movie gives an important statement in that debate.<br/><br/>In the end, just focusing on the movie, it was a really good movie. Well acted with a real good story that kept my interest without problem. A drama with some real emotion and close to the thriller genre. Well worth watching! 7+/10"
"nturner","8","1","3","7 November 2008"," Denunciation and Tribute
","I was a young adult during the Viet Nam era and by only a stroke of fate was not submitted to that carnage. Of course, during the 1960's, there was a draft and every young man was subject to being sent off to die at the whim of government officials.<br/><br/>The trauma to the protagonist in Stop-Loss can be likened to that of a young man drafted into battle in Viet Nam. The difference is this contemporary tale relays that the young man in question, Brandon, had volunteered to serve in the military and completed a tour of duty in war-torn Iraq with honors and along with his buddies with whom he enlisted arrives in his Texas hometown to a hero's welcome. He has had enough of war and is elated to be able to return to his civilian life and put the horrors of war behind him.<br/><br/>Brandon then finds that he has been stop-lossed - the fate of some eighty-one thousand soldiers thus far during the past five years - and is ordered to return to battle in Iraq. He flies into a rage and verbally assaults his commanding officer. As a result, he is ordered to the stockade until time to be redeployed. On his way to the stockade, he overpowers his guards, escapes, and goes AWOL.<br/><br/>Thus begins a quest to favorably resolve his situation by seeking out the senator who has told the conquering hero that he is available for help and counsel. Through a twist of fate, he is aided in his flight by the fiancé of his best friend with whom he had served in Iraq.<br/><br/>The young men depicted in Stop-Loss are surely not what one would call refined. They hail from the lower class of a small, Texas town and - had they not enlisted - would probably have had some sort of dead-end job. The armed forces offered them a profession and guidance. Unfortunately, it also offered death, horror, disfigurement, and post traumatic stress. These men are lost in their former world and exhibit negative reactions to it such as drunkenness, fighting, acts of civil violence, and combative attitudes toward the women in their lives. These men have allowed their narrow-minded attitude of macho to practically destroy their lives. Add that macho attitude to the indescribable visions of war in their minds, and you have an explosive situation.<br/><br/>The actors in this film perform an impressive job at giving the viewer a believable look at these young men and women.<br/><br/>Ryan Phillippe as Brandon is a perfect as the former macho jerk who has established himself as a leader who is maturing into a thinking, reasoning man.<br/><br/>Joseph Gordon-Levitt masters another edgy role as a man so dependent upon army life that he is unable to function as a civilian.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum is affecting in the role of Brandon's lifetime best friend who not only is suffering post traumatic stress but is unable to come to terms with the actions of his buddy.<br/><br/>Victor Rasuk gives a heartbreaking performance as the lover boy of the group who is horribly disfigured and wounded in battle. His performance is a tribute to all of the real soldiers who return from war and defeat seemingly insurmountable odds.<br/><br/>Abbie Cornish portrays Jeanie, an admirable woman who is the fiancé of Brandon's best friend and his support during his flight. Cornish gives us a sexy woman who is tough and not about to be done in by fate and the idiotic actions of the men in her life.<br/><br/>Needless-to-say, this film is a denunciation of the war and the stop-loss policy, but it is also a tribute to the young soldiers who go off to Iraq thinking that they are doing something good for their country. It's a very good film with a big heart and worthy viewing for any citizen."
"KUAlum26","8","1","3","3 August 2008"," Maybe not a great movie,but an important one
","Movies like this are gonna naturally garner controversy. They are practically made that way. So the message boards are just chock full of people posting opines one way or the other about the Iraq WAr as well as this movie and its relationship to it.<br/><br/>A tad unfortunate,really,since this film is more of a snapshot of the situation that is facing our enlisted men and women,and a very potent one at that.<br/><br/>It's no mistake,then,that the central character of this moral/civic duty dilemma film is a good 'ol boy from Texas named Brandon KIng(Ryan Phillipe,somewhat of a step back from work such as Crash and Breach),a mid-rank officer in the Army who has bravely served his tour(tours?) of duty in Iraq and arrives back home to his large,red state on the belief that he's home to stay,and having lost enough friends and brothers in arms in battle,he's reach a level of battle fatigue that is largely justifiable. Of course,the title of the film is a foreshadowing of the conflict and tension that is to come,as King(his rank escapes me at the moment.SArgenat?)is Stop-loss-ed,ordered to report back to duty. THree guesses as to how this sits with Brandon and the first two don't count.<br/><br/>A great supporting turn by Joseph Gordon LEavitt,as a childhood friend of Brandon's who also served in the Army and is the converse of Brandon:he MISSES being in the trenches and using his battle skills,but the Army has no designs on bringing him back in. Solid turns also by Timothy Olyphant(As a hard-headed,if perhaps one-not CO),Linda Emond(As Brandon's mom),CIaran HInds(blending in as Brandon's quiet but unconditionally supportive dad),Channing TAtum(as Brandon's gung-ho buddy)and Abbie Cornish as the tough,supportive friend who sides ultimately with the hero of the show.<br/><br/>Director Kimberly Pierce,who has some family ties to this war(I forget if it was a brother,a cousin,another relative,or whomever is serving or has served),makes no bones about it:she's out to stir some controversy and alert people to issues pertaining to the troops and how the policy and strategy of the war affect them on it. Love it or hate it,agree whole-heartedly or disagree vehemninently,one has to say that this film and story is food for thought,and THAT is definitely the characteristic of an effective and important movie."
"Tcarts76","2","1","4","1 September 2012"," Flat out anti-military propaganda, with no basis in facts
","OK, This movie was made simply as a propaganda piece. Plain and simple. The basic premise is that a ""Stoploss"" is a back door draft and forces people to stay in the Military longer than their initial contract length. Well, this falls flat on fact due to the fact that everyone ( at least before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan) all sign the same contract that states that whatever their active duty contract length is, it can be extended due to the needs of the Military. Every Military contract ( regardless of active duty length) signs up for 8 years. Period, the military, government,and right wing conspirators (thrown in for you conspiracy nuts) are not , and did not dupe anyone. These are facts not even taken into consideration for this movie, and it portrays members of the military as victims, which is entirely untrue. I know, I was in the military at the time and was stoplossed.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was horrible, Channing Tatum was the typical meat-head, but hey that is what he probably is in real life. Ryan Philipe shows why he doesn't do movies more often, and his wife Reese Witherspoon probably has to make up excuses for his bad performance. Joseph Gordon Levitt ( who is a decent actor) was type cast as the typical nerd, I just joined to be with my jock friends, character, Kinda like Screech from saved by the bell. <br/><br/>The movie presents some PTSD issues but it does it in a typical liberal, hatred for the Military fashion and plays up the ""victim"" part.<br/><br/>Basically it is just part of the Anti-Military, anti-war crowds new method, instead of spitting on soldiers like they did during Vietnam, they look down on them and cast them as movie victims.<br/><br/>If you want to see this movie I suggest you illegally download it so none of the filmmakers can make anymore money off it."
"Tony43","Null","1","4","9 April 2008"," Compelling, but not necessarily satisfying
","-----------------------------spoiler alert -------------------- Kimberly Peirce's first film since ""Boys Don't Cry"" tackles a big topic, maybe one that is too big for any director to attempt to cover in a single film. The irony is, she accomplishes her goals in terms of making a riveting movie, but perhaps fails in efforts to truly illuminate as complex an issue as the war in Iraq.<br/><br/>The plot is that Army sergeant Ryan Phillippe, a veteran of both the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns, finds out on the day he is mustering out of the Army that he is being stop lossed, meaning sent back involuntarily for another combat tour in Iraq.<br/><br/>But plot holes develop almost as quickly as he finds himself conscripted in what he refers to as a back door draft.<br/><br/>The first problem is that he immediately jumps the tracks and goes AWOL, when his carefully crafted image from the early parts of the movie show him to be a thoughtful, highly responsible soldier. Yes, he might eventually break the rules and jump ship, but not immediately and the film would have been even more interesting if he'd fought his situation through legal channels before deserting.<br/><br/>From there, a lot of the film deals with another problem, the post traumatic stress syndrome he and his small town Texas buddies are facing, in his case, largely because he led his men into a rather obvious ambush while in Baghdad, a trap that got his best friend killed and others wounded.<br/><br/>From there, the film deals with his life on the run, ironically with the ex-fiancé of another of his buddies, and that life affords a look at the white working class background upon which America's all volunteer Army is now built. While a little clichéd, it does remind us that there are tens of thousands of troops from that very background, many of whom seem to know or understand almost nothing about the war they have volunteered to fight.<br/><br/>______________________spoiler-------------------------- In the end, Phillippe's character turns himself in and winds up climbing aboard the bus that is the first step on the road back to Iraq. The trouble with the scene is it comes as a shock and its hard to know whether the filmmaker was saying Philippe was wrong all along, or that the average guy is just no match for the pressures being a good, dutiful American place on a young man.<br/><br/>Its sort of like Congress getting a clear mandate from voters in November of 2006 to end the war, but doing virtually nothing about it, because Democrats don't have the votes to overcome a Republican veto and then take the heat that would follow.<br/><br/>Whatever the message, it seemed to me to be a somewhat muddled one, and there is not much resolution to the story, as what it gives us is an ending that would have been more powerful had it come down hard on one side of the issue or the other.<br/><br/>Still, this film in all fairness works as a movie up to the end and I would not stay away just because it falls down there."

","I really loved this film! It took me in and got me involved from the start. I followed and identified with Ryan Phillipe's character from the opening scene. It was a realistic blend of what a social/geopolitical group perceives as it's foreign policy and what the individual actually endures to perpetuate that ideal.<br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>This film seemed to miss a lot of opportunity, and ignore some basic precepts along the way. It lost believability in the final acts, as the main characters are divided by ideals, but still cannot communicate. I find it hard to believe that the two main characters, who have grown up together to be best friends,in this film, cannot find some common ground in which to communicate. The fact that their short military service can divide them so unequivocally is very hard to swallow. Given the obvious fact that one of them is the 'smart' one,who gets it; and the other is the 'dumb', impressionable one who falls for the military propaganda, still does not over-ride the long relational bond that we suppose has developed and sustained these two 'blood brothers' through thick and thin, through life since the Third Grade. I cannot imagine a bond this close being broken by the regimen of military life. The Primary failure of this film lies, to me, in the relationship of the main character to his father. This could have been a heartfelt exploration of the true agony of battle, as seen from a popular war vs. an unpopular one. The Vietnam veteran and the Iraq veteran,father and son, and all that that implies,was completely ignored, and was a truly missed chance for the filmmaker to make a lasting impression on the audience. Instead, the emphasis on an unfair policy was made clear; but, in the end, no resolution, and no subjective or real 'content' was forthcoming. The final result of this film is an obvious attempt to jump on the bandwagon of recent times and exploit the idea that the US should not be involved in Middle Eastern politics. It could have been so much more..."

","...i.e. surprise surprise suddenly as of January 2009 one does not find any films damning the effort in Iraq or anywhere since his majesty was inaugurated. <br/><br/>I foolishly though this was a film about a boiler room on Wall Street - oh well next time dummy check it out first before you but it for $2.99 @ 7/11.<br/><br/>The incessant introspection and 'angst' very heavily laden. The one thing that was true was the protagonist stating there was no declared war with which to justify use of troops. Absolutely right but again no such films since 'his nibs' took over the white house and even with the indiscriminate use of drones, there won't be.<br/><br/>Lastly it could have been compressed into a 60 minute drama - I found the emotion boring I was fast forwarding to the final scene."

","The war movie has never been an easy thing to create, and over the course of history, it's hard to pinpoint any other genre of film that has managed to strike up as much controversy and debate. Stop-Loss is no different from those that reside within its close proximity, yet despite its ability to strike up conversation, to get the mind thinking and to question war itself, an obvious lack of sustainable narrative hurts the film where it matters most. Overlong, poorly focused and incoherent, the storytelling element of Kimberly Peirce's ambitious project here doesn't do as much justice to the themes of the script as she would probably have hoped to. To be fair, there is some hard-hitting material here, and characters along with their respective performers are rounded enough to avoid being mere place holders for ideas, and as such Stop-Loss does manage to retain a strong gasp upon the attention. Yet lumbered with a tedious middle act and an ending that seems ill at ease with itself, the ride, although mostly rewarding, is unavoidably rough.<br/><br/>In what is best compared to such war movies as the classic DeNiro and Michael Cimino film The Deer Hunter and Brian De Palma's effort from earlier this year, Redacted, Stop Loss is the kind of war movie that discusses war through its characters rather than the event itself. Negating Iraq to the opening ten minutes, Peirce and crew here adopt more of a road movie layout, detailing the concept of being Stop-Lossed, and the effects it can have on any soldier unlucky enough to be put through such a policy. On the run from his government, friends and fellow soldiers, lead character Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) spends much of the film coming to terms with how much of his life that he left behind many years ago has disintegrated while he has been away. Isolated and trying to find a way out of his predicament, King is an intriguing character who offers insight into the broken down psyche of an ex-soldier and during certain scenes Phillippe conveys such emotions and states of mind adequately. In this regard King is relatively close to DeNiro's 'Michael', and while Phillippe doesn't necessarily touch on what made Michael such a memorable character, the bare essentials are here and he does a decent job of what is offered to him.<br/><br/>Not satisfied with telling just one story however, the script takes its time to flesh out backing characters that grew up and served with King. These additions are welcome yet underused; there is a severe imbalance here between the lead character and his friends, and while one can accept this as part of having a 'lead-character', I couldn't help but notice that Stop-Loss could have worked far more effectively as a character study focusing on more than its central persona. Although King's comrades do get ample screen time, their eventual climaxes and turning points fail to resonate as much as they should, and as a result, the movie's statements and themes never deliver quite as much poignancy as they aim to. Yet again however, the performers themselves do a fine job with what they are given and deliver some sturdy performances that mesh with Phillippe's to create a solid wall of realism to bounce off of.<br/><br/>The best war movies it would seem are those that never necessarily take it upon themselves to overtly make statements on war regarding its pros and cons, and instead simply tell the story as it is. Whilst watching Stop-Loss, one gets the sense that director Kimberly Peirce has kept this in mind during the process but then never quite managed to overcome the script's obvious slant towards criticism of the war. Yet if there is a bias here, it is remote and minute; not because the writers chose to sit on the fence but simply through the fact that they tell a character story first and foremost rather than try to create a politically enlightening piece of propaganda. Such is the film's strength and its weakness. On the one hand, the drama is welcome and the performances involved ensure that the best moments are engaging and compelling. On the other hand however, a distinct lack of focus in this area quickly causes the movie's middle act to tread along at an uneven pace which often stutters and fumbles. With a tighter reign on what it is the movie was trying to say, and a deeper, centralised focus on character and the domestic drama involved with the political ramifications that have got them here, Stop-Loss could have been a lot more effective. Yet for what it is, those interested in the subject itself should find something to enjoy here.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"
"PersianPlaya408","8","0","2","3 August 2008"," A solid war film, (anti-war in many ways)
","A good movie about showing some of the downsides of war (well in a lot of people's opinion there really is no upside), Peirce's film does a good job examining some of the social effects of the war and how soldier's are affected. The problem with stop-loss is at times its a bit tiring, but and some of the actors' inexperience shows. However overall it does a good job conveying its message with a good score from John Powell and decent cinematography from Chris Menges. The editing was a bit flawed at times it wasn't always interesting, but overall, i thought it was well-written, well-acted for the most part, and certainly a good addition to the war film genre, as its a bit more realistic than a lot of the glorifying war films. Its not as good as David Ayer's Harsh Times, but its a different kind of film, and both were necessary in my eyes. This film also features Joseph Gordon Levitt with another very good performance- IMDb Rating: 6.5. MY Rating: 8/10"

","Of all the political films to come out in recent months, it's no surprise that most (if not all) have failed to draw a crowd. In a world where so much is going wrong, cinema offers a sweet oasis for millions to lose themselves in. And while many of these politically charged films have been duds themselves in terms of quality and spark, 'Stop-Loss' fairs better and happens to be one of the better projects to combine film and the war in Iraq.<br/><br/>Though it's not always easy to watch or easy to swallow, Kimberly Pierce's first film in nearly a decade is a sincere and heartfelt picture. It's not perfect, it's not great, but it's a worthy observation of an issue often forgotten in the larger scheme of things. It certainly doesn't shy away from the tough questions, as it asks what it truly means to 'support the troops'. Because when the leaders who continue to support an endless war begin exploit the men and women giving their lives overseas and correlate supporting them to supporting the 'war on terror', or better yet, being a patriot, it begins to take us down a very dangerous path. 'Stop-Loss' takes no shortcuts. No bullshit.<br/><br/>It's what makes this film frustrating. Because the issues it faces head on do not have an easy answer. It's not black and white, as much as we'd like it to be. Pierce does a fine job reinforcing this sad fact. It's comparable to 'In the Valley of Elah' in the way it attempts to paint a human face to help drive its message home. It's heartbreaking. But most of all, it's maddening. It is at times difficult to keep the anger from boiling inside of you, and I believe much of that can be credited to some very powerful performances courtesy of Ryan Phillippe, Channing Tatum, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Abbie Cornish.<br/><br/>'Stop-Loss' doesn't always reach the heights it had the potential for, and does struggle to find the right note to drive home. It takes on such a difficult issue that isn't at all easy to manage, and sometimes 'Stop-Loss' isn't as hard-hitting as I would have liked. It doesn't set out to solve a devastating military catch 22, but perhaps to start a conversation instead. To give us something to think about, something to question. It's a heavy film, but 'Stop-Loss' is a tragically complex story that deserves a moment of your time.<br/><br/>More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"

","First off, I do not agree with desertion or any anti-war stances. But I have to say that this movie really moved me, got me to thinking....what if I were in his shoes? The way some troops were/are being stop-lossed is pretty disgusting. I support our government and the USA is truly ""the land of the free and the home of the brave"" but when it comes to soldiers being stop-lossed, I have to say that it is an injustice to do such a thing to honorable heroes. Ryan Phillippe is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint in this movie! In fact, the whole cast did an outstanding job. I thought this was going to be another Hollywood forced way of thinking anti-war movie but I was pleasantly surprised. Even though there are parts that I didn't agree with, for the most part, I really enjoyed this film. Very emotional at times. And God bless our troops and the United States of America. Please be safe, my heroes."
