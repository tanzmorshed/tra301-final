","While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways. <br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can."

","If your horror movie tastes run less towards chainsaw-wielding maniacs and more towards things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, then this is the movie for you. Based on a short story by the great Stephen King, ""1408"" is one of the genuine movie sleepers of summer 2007.<br/><br/>John Cusack gives a tour-de-force performance as Mike Enslin, a successful writer who specializes in the investigation of paranormal activity with a particular emphasis on hotel rooms that have the reputation for being haunted. The twist is that Enslin is, essentially, a nonbeliever who spends most of his time and energy debunking the very subject off which he is making his living. The 1408 of the title refers to a room in a swanky, five-star Manhattan hotel in which, we are told, no fewer than fifty-six guests checked in but never checked out, having met their untimely demises there in the decades since the establishment opened. Determined to put an end to the ""foolishness,"" Enslin moves into the room convinced he will ride out the night in utter peace and safety. He has, of course, another think coming.<br/><br/>As adapted by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, ""1408"" succeeds mainly by keeping it straight and simple and by focusing so intensely on the character of Enslin and his relevant back story. The multi-layered plotting keeps us guessing from first moment to last, so that we never quite know whether what Enslin is experiencing is really happening or whether he is suffering some form of mental breakdown brought on by the death of his young daughter and the subsequent breakup of his marriage a few years back. Along with director Mikael Hafstrom, the master craftsmen responsible for the film's phenomenal art direction and sound recording draw us into the strange world they've created where nothing is quite what it appears to be and where we spend most of our time nervously scanning the edges of the frame to see what surprise is next poised to jump out at us.<br/><br/>Cusack, who has long been underrated as a performer, gets the chance to really show us his acting chops in this role. He allows us to clearly see the fear and vulnerability hidden beneath his character's wisecracking, cynical exterior. Samuel L. Jackson and Mary McCormack also excel in the small but crucial roles of the wise hotel manager and Enslin's estranged but faithful wife, respectively.<br/><br/>For those who can remember a time when fright films had more on their minds than simple blood and gore, ""1408"" is like a refreshing, restorative tonic on a hot summer day."
"antonioiam","8","536","664","21 June 2007"," An innovative horror film
","I've never seen a horror film quite like 1408--can you even call this film a ""horror""? Well, it's not the horror movie we're used to seeing in this day and age. The films that are supposed to scare us nowadays are made from the same recycled junk we've been seeing for years now. Nonsensical plots are dreamed up just to make use of the exciting range of CGI. Underdeveloped characters we don't care about are tortured/murdered by a psycho for no apparent reason. Most of the intended audience for these movies isn't even scared anymore.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, 1408 is different. Its main intention is not to scare you (though it undoubtedly will); it wants to tell you a story. It doesn't start out as a scary movie. John Cusack plays cult writer Mike Enslin, a man who visits supposed haunted spots in order to debunk their reputations in the mildly-successful books he writes with titles such as ""10 Nights in Haunted Hotels"". When the room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York is brought to his attention, research tells him that the death tally in the room is in the double digits. He sees the room as a solid ending chapter for the new book he's working on.<br/><br/>The film is based on a Stephen King short story, which I had the pleasure of reading before I saw the film. While the film does take its creative liberties, it never forgets where it comes from. Writers Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karazewski seem to be very well-read on the author, and the movie always feels just like Stephen King--if you've ever read him, you know what I'm talking about. There have been times when I've been reading a novel of his and had to tell myself, ""Calm down, it's just a book."" There are moments in this film of such mind-gnawing anxiety, such high-adrenaline terror that I had to tell myself, ""Calm down, it's just a movie."" (Note: Stephen King does recommend the film.)<br/><br/>Director Mikael Håfström never takes his audience's intelligence for granted. We're never beaten over the head with the same thing; the film is always headed somewhere new and exciting. The innovative ideas here are just terrific.<br/><br/>John Cusack is brilliant as the cynical writer with a tragic past. He's never unbelievable, and he always nails the character down perfectly. There was never a time when I wasn't rooting for Mike Enslin in 1408. There was never a time when I did not want him to get out of the room. Cusack's emotional range is really put into play here, and the casting could not have been any more dead-on.<br/><br/>Samuel L. Jackson gives a chilling performance as a manager who is intent on not letting Mike enter room 1408. His determination to convince Mike not to enter the room only fuels Mike's determination to enter it. Through him, we pick up on the facts about the room Mike's research couldn't provide. His warnings give us chill bumps but leave enough open so that we still don't know what we're in for.<br/><br/>And with room 1408, you never really know what you're in for. Who am I to ruin it for you? Just know that this is not a mystery. We will not come to understand why the room is the way it is. There are, of course, those who will be disappointed by 1408--because when all is said and done, they will find it's not a movie about a freaky hotel room, but rather the man who's trapped in that hotel room and what he finds there."
"dglink","8","262","330","22 June 2007"," Effective Ghost Story
","Just when you thought it was safe to check into a New York City hotel, along comes Mikael Hafstrom's chilling ""1408."" Not since Norman Bates terrorized guests at his motel has a paying customer received such treatment during a night's lodging. Although somewhat more cerebral than viscerally frightening, ""1408"" delivers its share of shocks and frights, and viewers will stay in their seats not to miss the film's twists and swerves. In a cruel blow to fans of 1970's soft rock, listening to the Carpenters' hit ""We've Only Just Begun"" afterward may stimulate nightmares and certainly will never be the same again.<br/><br/>John Cusack, a cynical writer who has sunk from producing intimate novels to hack work about haunted inns, is lured to a Manhattan hotel where room 1408 is off limits to visitors, because of its long history of inhospitality. With only a knapsack, but tons of baggage from family misfortunes, Cusack insists on a night in room 1408, despite the management's objections. Cusack triumphs over the staff and settles into the chamber's banal decor, which he idly describes piece by piece into his pocket recorder for the intended article. The evening starts to look like a genuine snooze, when the room's unsettling turn-down service, a chorus from the Carpenters, and a radio that begins an ominous countdown unnerve both Cusack and viewers.<br/><br/>Although the ""night in a haunted house"" routine has been done endlessly since movies began, Hafstrom for the most part effectively plays his audience with an eerie, often jarring, soundtrack, clever cutting, and a minimum of effects. ""1408"" is a ghost story, not a horror or slasher flick, and, as effective haunting tales have shown (""The Haunting,"" ""The Uninvited""), the unknown, the unseen, and the unexplained are far more frightening than CGI effects. Although reminiscent of ""The Shining,"" another Stephen King adaptation, this film was evidently made on a modest budget. Thus, Hafstrom worked largely with a one hotel-suite set and one mid-level actor. Besides Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson also appears as the enigmatic hotel manager, who warns Cusack about the room, yet seems to know more that he shares. Cusack is fine as always and carries the film effortlessly and literally through Hell and high water. While perhaps not as scary as the premise suggests, ""1408"" nevertheless provides intelligent entertainment for lovers of old fashioned ghost stories."
"shilbrecht","10","21","23","3 January 2008"," scared the heck out of me!
","First, I love John Cusack. Next, I used to love Stephen King when I was a teenager (now he scares me too much!). But I decided to watch this today on my On Demand in the middle of the afternoon in my family room while folding clothes. By the middle of the film, at 1:30 p.m., I was too scared to go in my basement to get any more clothes, so I just sat there and watched! This isn't a slasher type of scary. This is a get in your head and make you look behind you in case someone is lurking back there kind of scary. Sort of like The Shining (what is it with King and big, old hotels?) but not quite as scary, although almost.<br/><br/>Cusack's acting is excellent! I LOVED this movie, even though it scared the s**t out of me!"
"snow0r","9","151","190","4 September 2007"," different, subtle, and very, very good
","Please note that this review refers to the theatrical version, and not the Director's Cut DVD release which features a completely different ending.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin is a cynic. He is the author of books that detail and debunk popular ghost stories and haunted hot-spots, and it quickly becomes obvious that he is somewhat disenchanted with the life that he leads. That is, of course, until he receives an invitation to Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel, a room in which lies his and arguably John Cusack's biggest challenge yet.<br/><br/>It soon becomes apparent that 1408 is not your standard horror movie, as what follows, after an enjoyably creepy encounter with hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L Jackson), is essentially 90 minutes of John Cusack in a room. On his own. Save for, of course, whatever lurks inside 1408. It is a challenge that Cusack rises to expertly; we all know he's a good actor and a brilliant everyman (I don't remember a film in which I've wanted to see him crash and burn), but 1408 allows him to display his range to great effect as the room confronts him with the physical dangers of the present and the emotional tragedies of his past. <br/><br/>While it's relatively light on big scares, 1408 instead creates a powerful sense of unease that combines wonderfully with Cusack's portrayal of a man enduring his own private hell. Each challenge thrown up by the room takes the movie somewhere new and unexpected, ensuring that the movie never really gets tired or repetitive, and as a result each scene in the room is tense, surprising, and very, very creepy. However, that's not to say that it doesn't lose its way occasionally. Some of the CGI usage is quite ineffective, and about two-thirds through the movie it feels like it's about to go the wrong way, but it recovers well for the final act, and its haunting ending ensures that you'll remember it long after you leave the theatre.<br/><br/>A brilliantly acted, well developed version of King's short story, 1408 is a different type of horror movie, but in all the right ways. Very good!"

","I'm not a person that gets scared by cheap horror stories, not even when the master Stephen king is at his worst, but I certainly remember 1408. I read this short story quite a while ago right before bed, and I remember it made it quite hard to fall asleep after reading it. When I found out they'd made a movie out of it, I decided to see it as soon as i could and was not disappointed one bit.<br/><br/>The movie has managed to be just as disturbing as the book. This isn't a story of ugly monsters jumping out from the dark corners of a room, and while it does have a few of those of those gratuitous moments, the true horror in this movie lies within the psychological torture that john cusack's character is put thru. Everyone in the theater was leaning forward in their seats at the same time, and the calls of ""oh my god"" came from most people present as the entity tortures him in ways that are ever more cruel and disturbing.<br/><br/>I no longer remember the story well enough to know if it follows the book to the letter, but it doesn't have to and you don't care when you watch it.<br/><br/>John Cusack is flawless in his role, and he has to be since the movie is mostly just him alone with The Room. I did appreciate Samuel L Jackson as well, even though they seemed to have cast him just so he could drop an F bomb at the right time, which is getting tiring.<br/><br/>This story, whether it be in movie or book form, is not for the feint of heart, but if you want to see what true horror is about, this is one you can't miss."
"quint777","9","400","545","31 May 2007"," One of the better Stephen King Movies in a long time
","Here's why. Stephen King's psychological horror rarely ever shows its face on the screen the way it appears in his writing. This movie captures a lot of the mental torture that Stephen King writes so well (embodied in room 1408). I typically always see Cusack as playing himself in every movie he's in. Fortunately, this role appeals to that character. I would say see it and judge for yourself. I specifically enjoyed the background music and director's choice of camera angles. I also appreciated the mix of surprise horror and psychological. All too often, a horror film loads up too much on one side and it just doesn't work out well!"
"aaronandaustin","9","238","327","22 June 2007"," Wow! Much better than expected!
","A truly great horror film, with outstanding performances by both Samuel L. Jackson and Cusack. Well worth your money and time. If you are a Stephen King fan, then you will love this movie. I also suggest that you pick up and read the short story Room 1408. The movie truly captures the essence of the story, and when watching it, you'll think ""Wow... this is definitely a Stephen King movie.""<br/><br/>The film is so convincing that I couldn't believe that King didn't write the screenplay himself. This is a wonderful way to spend a few hours; I'm definitely going to see this one again.<br/><br/>This film also breaks away from the (at least recent) standard of having a crummy, thrown together story with copious amounts of gore thrown in in place of plot. This movie has an excellent story that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat."

","Shined Up<br/><br/>I decided to watch this after Polanski's ""the Tenant"" and that was probably a bad choice, because that film is precious.<br/><br/>This one consists of three elements, typical of the King formula.<br/><br/>The first is the expression of terror, shaped safely so that you can watch but not be personally threatened. I think this is a King invention. Here, we know WE would have taken seriously the warnings so he deserves what he gets. It relieves us.<br/><br/>The second element is trite, so far as I am concerned. Also a King specialty is to weave some sort of emotional trauma into the otherwise merely decorative horror. Here it is the death of our character's child, which happened before we meet him. This allows for the final zinger.<br/><br/>The third element is the stuff I study and that King knows well. I call it narrative folding. Situations are nested in each other. Time gets shifted, at the same time that the period in the room proceeds in real time, even with a clock counting down. Ghosts inhabit ghosts and all people are ghosts. Cold is hot. Water is land. Daughter is wife. <br/><br/>This is the stuff that makes the film work, and I think it is done pretty well. Its why they picked Cusak. He understands this stuff. Has since ""Malkovich"" and ""Fidelity"" and mastered in ""Identity.""<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"mstomaso","8","122","167","24 June 2007"," Best King Horror Adaptation since The Shining
","John Cusack gets drunk and trashes a hotel room. <br/><br/>What could be more fun? <br/><br/>Well, how about a hotel room that isn't just haunted, but is actually a place where the universe's physical laws - especially the ones that deal with trivial matters such as space and time - don't really apply, and the room itself is a sentient manifestation of evil. <br/><br/>Getting better? <br/><br/>Well, what if we give our 'sentient manifestation of evil' a consciousness and the ability to penetrate and read the subconscious minds of anybody who happens to be in the room and then show them their worst fears or deepest pains?<br/><br/>Still not satisfied? <br/><br/>OK - just for the sheer hell of it (and there is plenty of sheer hell to go around in this film) - why not make Cusack a self-righteous investigative documentarian who is going around debunking hauntings all over the U.S., but is actually in denial about enormous emotional problems centering around his daughter's death and his own childhood. <br/><br/>If this sounds like fertile ground for entertainment, and you don't mind getting scared half to death, you should go see 1408 right away. <br/><br/>It was long ago, and I was different person when I read the Steve King story upon which this film is based, so I can't really comment on how close to the text 1408 is. What I can say, however, is that this film is a more true representation of the feeling of King's writing and pacing than almost any I can think of. This is also the first film I have seen in many years that actually made my skin crawl (across the floor of a crowded theater). <br/><br/>The film wastes relatively little time setting up Mike Enslin's character and situation, but once its all on the table, you find yourself incapable of escaping either. I have seen a couple of reviews which attack 1408 for lack of characterization. These reviewers must have wandered into the wrong theater, because they've not seen the same film I just saw. My advice to these reviewers is - try paying more attention to what your watching instead of your pre-conceptions about the genre. Cusack's character is beautifully set up - from his editor's ""he can get kind of morose."" to his more-or-less constant drinking, painful flashbacks focusing on his daughter, and inability to communicate with people he cares about. It's all there, for those who have the attention span and sensitivity to look for it. <br/><br/>Cusack's performance is a tour-de-force of physical and psychological acting. Having a hard time imagining him in this role? Take what Cusack did in ""Being John Malkovich"", quadruple the intensity, the fear, and the suspense, add alcoholism and self-denial, and there you have Mike Enslin. I never doubted that Cusack had the raw talent, but was actually surprised to see him pull it off SO well. Although the films are radically different, this could be for him what 'Leaving Las Vegas' was to Nick Cage, or what 'Hollywoodland' should be for Ben Affleck. The rest of the cast all have fairly minor roles, but are fine. <br/><br/>Mikael Hafstrom did a very nice job with directing. There is never a pointless scene, nor a dull moment, nor any loose ends. The plot is spelled out in detail, and all the clues are there to unravel the mysteries, but the clues are not so unsubtle as to permit you to guess what's next. As I said before, the feeling and pace of King's work come through very nicely. The special effects are all very convincing (relatively little CGI, and where animation was used, it was very well done),and the camera-work is picture perfect. I was especially impressed by the fact that 1408 cost about $25,000,000 to make - a mere pittance compared to many of the schlock-fests Hollywood horror has tossed up recently. <br/><br/>Very highly recommended for people who tend to sleep easily at night. If you are an insomniac, catch a matinée like I did."

","Mike Enslin makes a living as an author, who specializes in the paranormal phenomenon. After receiving a postcard saying DO NOT STAY IN 1408, Mike becomes intrigued. After much hassle and waring from the hotel Manager, Mike finally makes it into the room. What at first seems to be a normal hotel room, turns into a horrific nightmare and Mike only has one hour to live.<br/><br/>There have been many films based on Kings writings. Some of these films are terrifying, such as IT and The Shinning; while others are terrifyingly bad, Dreamcatcher anyone? The latest film to be added to the list is 1408 and lucky for us it belongs to the former. 1408 works on many different levels and even throws a twist to the audience. While it's not the best King adaptation it certainly is one of the better ones and deserves to be called The Shining for 2007.<br/><br/>In the era when so called horror films are full of SAWS and HOSTELS, it's refreshing to see some new blood being pumped into the genre. 1408 pumps a whack of blood and a whole lot more. The film starts off as one would expect, with Mike investigating one of his routine spooky places, then goes on to show his life as a writer with not so many fans. We get a sense of loneliness with Mike, he has lost something. Cusack plays the character well. For those who think they can't get pass the fact that it is John Cusack, I assure you you will not think about it during this film. His performance is a complete 180 from his previous work and I give him credit for pulling it off. Cusack goes through a wide range of emotions through this film, most of them being on the terrified side, but everyone of them is believable. Sure there are many other actors out there who could have pulled off this role, but Cusack does a fine job. Which is a really big thing that this film depends on, because there is virtually no one else in this film. The supporting characters are lucky is they get 10 minutes of screen time. Tony Shalhoub, of MONK fame is only in one scene and Mr. Jackson shares the screen with Cusack for just about ten minutes...to explain the horrors of the room, then he's gone.<br/><br/>Håfström, whose work I'm not too familiar with does an excellent job of bringing King's short story to live with a vivid and creative imagination. He manages to keep the audience on the edge of their seat throughout the film the moment the terror starts. The film's intentions are not to scare you with the ""jump"" tactic, but tries to pull something deeper, the kind of scare the builds and builds until you can't take it anymore. The entire time we are in this claustrophobic room and we know danger is looming, but we can't escape. We are stuck in this room because Mike is stuck in this room. We know the dangers ahead, we want out, he doesn't. The cinematography is beautiful, especially considering it takes place in one room. From the icy cold snow to the green walls and even the burnt aftermath of destruction, the film is beautiful no matter what is on the screen.<br/><br/>Cusack talking into his recorder acts as his mind trying to grab any sense of reality in this evil room. Trying to debunk the true horrors of what is actually happening. Those true horrors are psychological. One minute something spooky is happening, then next everything is normal. This mind game has been done before and before and here it's brought to the next level. Everything that happens can instantly change. One minute you can be walking in the room full of snow, then next your trapped under water. Being confined to this one room with this one character places tension on the audience as well. We don't know what is going to happen next, but we know it's not good.<br/><br/>There is somewhat of a twist in the film, I won't give it away, but once it happens you see 3 things happen and in this order. One is disappointment, the next is predictability and finally excitement that what you predicted is true. During this third part of things that happen, the scene in which everything is thrown back into focus is superbly done. Kudos to that scene as it is one of the best in the entire film. The main characters life he thought he had all of a sudden comes tumbling down, literally. This whole segment does slow down the pace of the film, but it fits perfectly into the psychological torment of this character.<br/><br/>In the end 1408 is an excellent film that will send shivers down the spines of those wanting a good scare. If you're sick and tired of the played out genres of SAW or HOSTEL, 1408 is something new and exciting and actually good. You won't get much from anyone other then Cusack, but what he brings to the table is indeed a good performance. Every corner and every room within 1408 is something that you will have to see for yourself, you never know what horrors lie next and that my friend, is a good horror film."

I don't remember a lot of what I said for that movie, but I do know that in a world of Saw, Hostel, and other movies that try to be horror but can't make the grade, I felt that Dead Silence was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>After watching 1408 I know that the REAL breath of fresh air is the amazing almost 1 man performance of John Cusack, as well as the great support work by Samuel L. Jackson and Mary McCormack.<br/><br/>This is a movie that not only made me jump at certain times like Dead Silence did, but it also made me legitimately scream out in fear of a particular scene involving John Cusack on a ledge on the 14th story of a building. I guess my fear of heights also had something to do with it.<br/><br/>This is a movie for guys to take women that they like to, so that when the real scary parts do kick in, the classic jump-into-your-lap-in-terror will happen.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the pansy PG-13 rating. It is very scary and even though I didn't read the Steven King book of the same name, I feel that this totally captures King's own personal sense of fear. I definitely give this 10 out of 10 because this is without a doubt one of the most frightening (and I mean that in a good way, not in a crappy slit your wrists because Showgirls sucks kind of way) movies to come out in a very long time.<br/><br/>So go and see it, enjoy it,and let's hope that maybe Hollywood can give us REAL horror movies instead of the cheap, lame wannabes that have disgraced our movie screens before this film came out."
"pyrocitor","8","13","15","13 March 2008"," Gripping, albeit conventional throwback to the era of psychological horror
","The word ""horror"" has become increasingly twisted in modern cinema to be equated with paper thin excuses for characters being subjected to senseless violence and various cheap shocks intended to make the audience sporadically jump rather than actually be subjected to an all-consuming sense of overwhelming fear. With that in mind, it is refreshing to see a literary adaptation from Steven King, largely considered the godfather of the modern horror story, which resists falling prey to such trappings, and instead concentrates on generating more carefully thought out scares, preying on deep seated societal terrors. As such, director Mikael Håfström's 1408 proves a merciful throwback to the days of psychological horror thrillers, concentrating more on the mind than the bile duct, and a solid enough effort to help re-instigate the initial traits of the genre into the modern mainstream. <br/><br/>While the film's premise of a jaded writer (Cusack) with a haunted past attempting to debunk legendary horrific sites having his cynicism tested by unknown forces surrounding an ominous hotel room with a death toll of 57 may sound implausible out of context, the film's execution is just intelligent and self-aware enough to make it work. Håfström's firm and capable directorial hand keeps things suitably grounded in reality when some of the film's more far-fetched plot points threaten to overwhelm the credibility of the work as a whole (for starters, the question as to why a hotel with such a macabre past would be allowed to continue to operate, let alone have clientele is never addressed, and the ending twist may leave audiences divided as to its effectiveness...). But 1408 looks and feels like such a staunchly quality work that such complaints often disintegrate once the film picks up upon the introduction of the titular room and the viewer is wrapped up by the superbly executed suspense generated throughout. <br/><br/>And while the film does dip rather heavily into conventions of previous similar works (the horrifying events Enslin is subjected to feel almost like a checklist of horror movie plot devices) the element which really makes the film worthwhile and excuses many of the inevitable lapses in logic is the psychological angle, leaving the audience consistently guessing as to whether the paranormal events are actually happening or whether the whole thing is occurring in the protagonist's feverish mind. While the screenplay varies between cleverly crafted lines and typical horror melodrama, the film proves an intriguing experiment in making use of a single space, and instead of the film being shot primarily in a single room proving limiting, Håfström manages to make it consistently fresh and engaging in its ever- changing state. The uncommonly innovative cinematography adds to the scare factor, as does Gabriel Yared's musical score, despite its frequent descent into horror cliché. <br/><br/>Despite the film being for the most part essentially a one man show, the inspired casting of John Cusack as Mike Enslin proves the film's most promising attribute. With only four walls and a floor to interact with for the bulk of the narrative, Cusack's quirky charisma proves the perfect element to provide a fresh touch to what could have collapsed into commercial formulaic monotony. With a brilliantly tuned, entirely credible rendition of a scarred cynic descending slowly into madness, Cusack resists the temptation to ham it up, and instead remains coolly understated, making it all the more unsettling as his composed exterior slowly unravels. Perfectly delivering many of his character's wittily verbose lines, Cusack sells the role with a commanding credibility few other actors could have mustered. Samuel L. Jackson also makes a strong impression in his brief scenes, and despite the almost unnecessary inclusion of his character, Jackson makes it worth the audience's while with a weighty gravitas which perfectly amps up the tension for the ensuing horror. Mary McCormack also does her best as the hideously conventional ""distanced wife still attracted to the protagonist"" figure, and emerges with a decent performance despite her almost criminally underdeveloped role. <br/><br/>What could have descended into commercial drivel under different circumstances instead proves a surprisingly intelligent and capably crafted psychological thriller, a merciful diversion from the trashy gore-fests inundating cinemas these days. While comparisons to earlier King adaptation The Shining among other works are inevitable, and despite the frequent reliance on formula, somehow new frights are extracted from age-old conventions, and with a strong directorial touch and an endlessly engaging lead performance 1408 proves a gruesomely entertaining bright spark in a fading ember of a genre, one which even the most jaded horror fans can appreciate and enjoy. <br/><br/>-8/10"
"Quinoa1984","7","111","165","24 June 2007"," like a very good feature-length episode of the Twilight Zone: surrealism and 'gotchas' at every corner
","It's a hit or miss thing with Stephen King movies. Sometimes there's an exceptional effort by someone with a really strong vision (eg Kubrick, De Palma), but then there are also some big blunders (Dreamcatcher comes first to mind). And then there are those that sort of lie right in the middle, as decent, unpretentious but unremarkable efforts that chill or spill into your living room or movie theater. 1408 isn't a great thriller, but for King fans it'll likely be one of the most faithful- or at least feel faithful- efforts to date, and as such it's pretty creepy and a sure-fire ""gotcha"" machine. The premise is vintage King: a cynical writer (Cusack) who's books go over the paranormal (with the exception of a personal book about a father and son), and gets sent an anonymous postcard about the Dolphin hotel and room 1408. The manager warns him, fervently, to not stay in the room. But he's insistent to the point where there's no turning back. Slowly, but extremely surely, things start popping up in the room, out of Elsin's own consciousness, perhaps, and as well with the environment changing (fix that heater!), and even a pint-sized version of the hotel manager (who doesn't want to see Jackon ala Indian in the Cupboard?).<br/><br/>It all leads up to a few good twists and turns, but good being the important word here. Unlike the unsuccessful pot-boiler Identity, which also (regrettably) starred Cusack, this isn't contrived for the sake of it. The sudden images of a man with an ax swinging at Elson, the images of ghosts jumping out of the windows (one of them, which I found extraordinary, was shown with the same marks that come with an old movie print), isolation enhanced by a lack of windows to either side, and that bottle of booze. Spiked? Probably not- this is a thrill-ride predicated on lightning-fast imagery, but too fast (it isn't Saw thank goodness), and Elsin's past, notably the death of his daughter. It's usually a conceit that the filmmaker puts in to have the central character to have a dark past loaded with sadness, but here it works effectively in how gradually it all comes out, and how the fear/acceptance of death is something just as, if not more-so, terrifying than anything else the room has to offer.<br/><br/>As I said, not a great film, as sometimes it has that feel of an all-too well-oiled machine by director Mikael Håfström, edging on feeling like there's a checklist somewhere of things to happen in the room to Elsin. But, as mentioned, it doesn't come off as being too unsurprising. On the contrary, there is some originality to how the special effects team- via Cusack, going through many modes of acting like it's a powerhouse audition- bring out the best of what can be offered with a horror-show amusement park. It may be in part like a ghost house, but it's a fun and exciting one, and more watchable than any other PG-13 horror film I've seen in a while. 7.5/10"
"DavidSim240183","9","9","10","19 January 2009"," We've only just begun!
","At a time that sees cinemas inundated with slasher movies, along comes a pleasant surprise like 1408. It hearkens back to the good old psychological horror flicks of the 70s and 80s. Something we don't see much of nowadays. Ones where normal people wind up in circumstances beyond their control. Its not much of a surprise then that the film is based upon a short story by Stephen King.<br/><br/>I haven't read the story, but I have a feeling I'd enjoy it if the film is anything to go by. Although Stephen King is a fine writer, one of his greatest faults is he tends to fall into too much of a self-indulgence. Some books, like Insomnia could easily have been trimmed down without losing anything important. But King doesn't always know when to call it a day. He has to include minor characters that slow down the narrative. It was something that particularly crippled Insomnia. That book was more of a chore than a pleasure to get through.<br/><br/>King's best work is when he reduces stories to a bare minimum, and allows the ideas to grow out from there. Books like Misery, Cujo, The Shining. All books that are a strong influence on 1408. The idea behind it is simple. A sceptical writer, Mike Enslin checks into a so-called haunted hotel room. He's made a career out of debunking ghost stories and folk tales, and he doesn't expect 1408 to be any different.<br/><br/>Except this one is haunted. No one has ever managed to survive a night in 1408. In fact they don't usually last more than an hour. 56 people have died within its walls. And the room arrays all sorts of horrors, physical and psychological, driving Mike to more desperate methods to escape, before it kills him.<br/><br/>Its the sheer simplicity at the heart of it that makes 1408 such a wonderful horror film. Certainly one of the best I've seen in some time. Watching different ideas take shape to propel the story, its something you'd imagine Vincenzo Natali dreaming up if he decided to make horror films and not science-fiction. 1408 is a wonderful display of misdirections and jarring reversals. Especially during the initial scenes.<br/><br/>Mike hears nothing but tales of woe and misery about 1408 from the hotel manager (rather effectively played by Samuel L. Jackson). Mike doesn't believe it. Jackson becomes more insistent. Mike becomes more sceptical. And we the audience are that all the more curious to see the blood-curdling horrors of 1408. When we finally get there, we're half expecting to see blood bleeding down the walls or objects flying about the room. Except its the exact opposite. Its just an ordinary hotel room. Sterile. Bland wallpaper. The epitome of mundane normalcy. But its just a facade. To lull you in. That's the trap of 1408.<br/><br/>Director Mikael Hafstrom's handling of the initial scenes is really quite masterful. He almost pulls an age old magicians trick on us. Making us want to see magic before it actually comes. As soon as Mike enters the room, although it looks normal, we keep waiting for the shoe to drop. It makes the tension more edgier. And when the room finally delivers its shocks, they really pack a punch. Bravo to Hafstrom for waiting so long and not rushing into the action. A pitfall a lesser director could easily have fallen into.<br/><br/>Hafstrom allows the horrors to build with a real smooth assurance. First its just little things. Like clock radios suddenly switching on. Windows slamming down. A malfunctioning thermostat. All things that can happen in real life. Nothing to signify anything supernatural. But then things get worse. When Mike tries to escape via window ledge, it just leads to nowhere. The air ducts are a rat maze of never-ending shafts and dead-ends. It eventually gets so bad its as if the room itself has taken on a life of its own.<br/><br/>When Mike tries to call his wife through his laptop, an image of Mike starts talking to her, trying to convince her to come to the hotel, and entrap her in the room too. It even winks at the real Mike! One thing that surprises about 1408 is its sense of humour. Parts of the film are really blackly funny. The laptop scene. The different ways the room frustrates Mike's attempts to escape. Best of all is the clock radio. Not only does it give Mike constant reminders of how long he has to live, it plays (cheerfully) at various times the song from The Carpenters ""We've only just begun."" Like some morbid version of Groundhog Day!<br/><br/>The film's script runs us through a rigorous gamut of emotions. From curiosity, to discovery to outright horror. And John Cusack handles them all superbly. He's a good choice for the part of Mike. The wry irony he's mastered to perfection over the years is well suited to a seen it all before sceptic who gets in way over his head. He does a great job of carrying a whole film on his shoulders.<br/><br/>People have been quick to call 1408 a ripoff of The Shining. I don't agree. If anything, the film reminds me of the Coen classic Barton Fink. Since its more a case of a creepy hotel room rather than a hotel. And John Cusack does a far better job of playing a man driven to the edge by ghosts of the past than Jack Nicholson's irritating performance. The film ends on a few surprises. Perhaps too many. But I was kept guessing about the outcome right up until the very end.<br/><br/>Mikael Hafstrom seemed a little unsure of himself in his prior film, Derailed. A frustrating film that never saw the brilliance in its own material, but with 1408, he's come into his own and handles things like a pro. A rare horror film of ideas in a bankrupt genre."

","Story vs. Movie <br/><br/>Whereas much of the short story takes place in the office of the hotel manager, Olin, and (after a short stint in the hotel room) follows Mike Enslin throughout the aftermath of his experience, the core of the movie takes place in the room 1408.<br/><br/>The author, portrayed to excellence by John Cusack, is self-assured, even a little cocky. His journey through haunted places in the world is more of a search for the supernatural for personal reasons rather than stemming from any real belief in the afterlife.<br/><br/>In the short story, the author is even more arrogant in his disbelief of the supernatural, though there is no personal connection for his searchhe simply writes books on the subject and they have made him a great deal of money. But most of his bravado takes place in Olin's office, out of the reach of ""the thing in that room."" The hotel manager tries everything to convince him not to stay in 1408, and it seems that the long talk does have some impact on him; when he first reaches the infamous room, he believes that his eyes are playing tricks on him. The door looks crooked, then normal, then slanted again in the other direction until it is once again normal.<br/><br/>Things begin to happen almost immediately once he is inside the room. The paintings move, ""something"" tries to come into the space through the walls. To escape he finally decides to set himself on fire and is fortunate enough to escape, the flames put out by a passerby.<br/><br/>After the occurrence in room 1408, there is an obvious transformation in the main character. A sense of sadness and loneliness emanates from Enslina sense of defeat. It reminds me of the feeling that permeates another story in the collection, ""Luckey Penny."" Through the second half of the story, Mike Enslin carries himself as a man that will forever be looking over his shoulders at the shadows, imaging that ""they"" will somehow drag him back into the confines of the hotel room to finish off the job.<br/><br/>In the movie, this is not the case. Cusack, as Mike Enslin, portrays a sense of increased strength, the will of the fighter that has seen the true horrors and survived to tell the tale. Whereas in the story the character tries to immediately forget what happened, in the movie he is shown playing the tape of his trusty mini-recorder, listening to what is arguably one of the most horrifying moments from his stay in the hotelhis encounter with his dead daughter. When his wife walks into the living room, she is stunned, and the look on Enslin's face seems to say ""Yes, it's all true."" No fear, just a resignation to the fact that there is something else, and he's not entirely sure that is a good thing.<br/><br/>The story and the movie are both executed smoothly, though the horror in the story (aside from the few pages that take place in the room) is far more psychological. It's the type of fear that doesn't necessarily get the adrenaline gushing; rather it's the type of fear that puts an unsettling chill to the bones. The character experiences symptoms of someone that has lost his battle with life and perhaps with sanitybad blood pressure, poor sight, bad nerveshe is old before his time. And as Enslin waits for his final days, he has the distinct feeling that whatever was in that room may be waiting for him on the other side.<br/><br/>In the film, the 70 minutes in the room are filled out with all sorts of nightmarish horrorsdead people appearing and disappearing, blood gushing from the walls, two particularly terrifying scenes in which Enslin sees himself die. At one point, he believes that he has escaped from the room, that is was all a nightmare brought about from a hit on the head with a surf board. Just as he believes that things are back to normal, he is thrust back into that nightmare of a room. However, instead of giving up, he keeps fighting. In a dramatic turn of the tables, he sets the room on fire and frees himself; in that action he makes sure (or does he?) that no person will ever be subjected to the inhuman presence in that room ever again.<br/><br/>I liked both versions, for different reasons. While for some the short story of ""1408″ may play out as a biting-your-nails type of horror, I felt that there was something of the scare tactic of mind over matter at play. As if the experience was something that could have been a hallucination brought on by a little too much to drink and the clever wordplay of a desperate hotel manager looking to put the scare into someone that doesn't scare easily. It was something of a quiet horror that consisted more of Enslin's health problems resulting from the event and the very real manifestations of something that could have all been in his head. In the short story, even when the main character wins, he loses. The movie, on the other hand, consisted of edge-of-your-seat horror, the thrill ride that goes faster and faster. If you haven't yet viewed the movie, or read the short story, I suggest you do both and compare the terror for yourself."

","The idea behind 1408 is actually kind of cute; a sort of 'what if' scenario based on what might happen if an inanimate object was given life. We've all seen Child's Play and perhaps the less than desired sequels but here, the inanimate object given life and then forced to fall into the horror genre is a motel room  a neat and effective idea. Following on from other such Stephen King adaptations, 1408 adopts the approach of putting someone in an individual location and then allowing events to unfold around them without ever letting them leave: it can be a prisoner in The Shawshank Redemption in a prison; a crippled author trapped in a lodge in Misery or a haunted motel room you cannot escape from as seen here.<br/><br/>1408 begins with an immediacy; a false immediacy that caught me off guard and worked really well. We get John Cusack's character Mike Enslin driving in the rain, at night and clearly lost  an easy, easy set up for a horror film but what follows is him finding the motel he was looking for, staying the night and leaving the next day in some disappointment  it is an anticlimax, for the character as well as for us as we have been led down a route of suspecting the film will begin its scares from the very off with a familiar set up before having everything cancelled and having the film cut to some bright, colourful shots of people surfing.<br/><br/>But the subject matter and choice of editing is the secret here and it mirrors the idea the director has for the anti-climax. A dark, wet and 'spooky' for the genre night is juxtaposed for shots of the sea and surfers going about their business in bright sunshine. In fact the film goes on and has its ghost hunting author of the lead role state that he hasn't ever actually even seen a ghost, which further adds to the now dead and unsuspecting atmosphere the film has decided to lay onto us. It's these early mind-games and cancelling out what we take for granted that kicks the film off wonderfully well, setting up things to come.<br/><br/>But Mike is drawn to a hotel called The Dolphin, and its infamous room 1408 from which the film gets its title. 1408 is a doomed, cursed room that keeps its inhabitants and renders them insane over time by basically erasing them from the face of the Earth; either that or erasing the face of the Earth around them so that the room and the individual are the only things that seem to exist. But while the film is not flawless, the exchanges and that initial thirty to forty minute trip once inside the room has more than enough ammunition to label this a successful horror film. The pleasantries and the introductions are done in a very urgent and dismissive manner; hotel hot-shot Gerald Olin (Jackson) doesn't build the room up prior to entry in a 'be careful' or a 'it's dangerous' mannerism but goes the whole hog and simply tells Mike it's a death trap and he will not survive, period.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that we have no reason to believe anything that initially happens in room 1408 is really all that bad. The film has given us a series of scenes prior to the main course of a night in 1408 that do not have anything to do with the horror genre, at least not conventionally: they consist of a beach scene where people surf; a public book signing and a scene in which the lead character checks their mail  how many horror films would usually have their lead check their mail before heading off for the film's main plot strand? But this is what's clever about 1408, the 'scares' at the early stage consist of window's accidentally shutting on the individual's hand; taps breaking off and spraying water everywhere and the alarm radio randomly coming on to the tune of The Carpenters.<br/><br/>So these events could just be coincidence, indeed even Mike comes to the conclusion he has been drugged through the whiskey and complimentary mint after all the fancy build up and is imagining it all, he and us have good reason to believe it could all be fake. One of the other reasons 1408 works is because of its protagonist and how strong and independent they are  the hero here is not some teenager whose reason to exist is so that they can be chased by a knife wielding maniac, Mike is a smart man who seeks these sorts of situations down and indeed uses several methods to calm himself down when everything feels a little too real  he is rational and realistic.<br/><br/>Although the best bit about 1408 is what you might come to realise afterwards in the sense it could be a metaphorical journey for Mike given what revelations and problems arise, to do with domestic issues, later on. 1408 is his purgatory where he is forced to confront his past demons; it's a metaphor for coming to terms with what happened and who he is, especially after so many monotonous mis-fires in this job as an author. 1408 is a creepy and unnerving film that also comes across as quite smart. In my view, a success."

","""... you can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave!""<br/><br/>This movie might have been better had it ripped off more of that song. That's not to say that all of ""1408"" was a farce on ""Hotel California"": this was an original Stephen King story, after all, and there was no pink champagne on ice (rather a bottle of whisky)... and there were a lot less plot holes in the song. But in any case, if you substitute ""Nightman"" for ""Creepy Voice on the Phone"", you might end up with the basic plot of ""1408"".<br/><br/>You can read the basic plot of the story anywhere: angsty, moody writer Mike Enslin (our fabulously miscasted John Cusack) forces the manager of the Dolphin Hotel (our fabulously casted Samuel L. Jackson) to rent him a ""haunted"" hotel room. The only way this story differs from any other predictable haunted-hotel-room tale is in the way backstory is used: we get to know a lot about Enslin and how he became obsessed with the occult, ghosts, and hauntings, more than in the original Stephen King story.<br/><br/>However, the movie's fatal weaknesses are in (a) the main character himself, (b) gaping plot holes in the story, and (c) the fake plot twist halfway through.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin might be a fairly engaging character to some--he's funny, intelligent, and cynical. But a few scenes, in particular, were heartwrenchingly beautiful, and we come to feel very deeply for the star of this horror flick in a way that is just fundamentally unfitting, and the worst part is that this feeling ends up being thrown out by the end. There's no denying that Cusack is a great actor: but it totally broke the pace of the movie to have a heart-wrenching memory scene of Enslin's dying daughter Katy, right in between an earthquake and a flood. It simply didn't fit, particularly when, ten minutes later, Enslin lies under a sofa and started maniacally laughing. <br/><br/>Now, take ""Identity"", a 2003 horror film in which Cusack starred. His main character there was extraordinarily sympathetic, but that empathy didn't clash with the plot and action in the way this one did.<br/><br/>The crucial problem was this movie had as many plot holes as Pennsylvania has deer, not to put too fine a point on it, and THAT was where the heart-wrenching just didn't work. No one survives more than an hour in the room, and yes, the clock does begin a countdown from sixty minutes--but not until Enslin has gone over the room with a fine-tooth comb and a UV lamp, and an electrician has fixed the thermostat. Sure, no electronics work in 1408--except Enslin's computer, which somehow manages to pick up wireless even when the rest of the building somehow disappears. Yes, the room is playing with Enslin's psyche and bringing his daughter into the mess--but then why drag in the one extremely short and pointless scene with his father? And though Jackson's line of ""That is one evil f#@%!ng room,"" might suffice for Enslin and for most moviegoers, I would have been pretty happy to find out just what is ACTUALLY going on in 1408.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending action, or even the stupidest fake plot twist to ever fakely twist a plot--go somewhere else in the movie comments for that. And I'm not going to lie: I really did like this movie as a noncommittal horror film, and I even enjoyed those heart-wrenching scenes between Enslin and Katy. (I can only hope they show up again in another Cusack film in the future.) But ultimately, the elements of fine acting and crappy horror just didn't mix well, and it really just became a noncommittal horror film, with no potential, and hopefully (oh God, please) no sequels.<br/><br/>Besides, all that kept running through my head were the words to ""Hotel California.""

"MaximumMadness","9","7","8","16 March 2012"," ""1408"" is a fantastic haunted-house movie in the spirit of ""The Changeling"" and the original ""The Haunting""... Not to be missed!
","John Cusask stars in 2007's ""1408"", a haunted-house-esque thriller based upon a Stephen King story of the same name. I've been going through a severe addiction to haunted-house and ghost movies over the past few months, and I recently re-watched this film after having not seen it in about three years, and I have to say- this film holds up darn well, and is one of the finest modern ghost stories I've seen on film in some time. It follows in the great tradition of classics like ""The Changeling"" and the original ""The Haunting"", giving us a creepy film that also deeply explores a troubled character and what makes him tick.<br/><br/>Cusask stars as Mike Enslin, an author whom has made a career recently out of writing books where he ranks various supposedly-haunted locations around the country for supernatural enthusiasts. Though he makes it clear that he is a skeptic and doesn't really believe in what he writes about. One day, after receiving a postcard from the upscale New York City hotel The Dolphin, with a cryptic message warning him to avoid room 1408, he becomes curious, and despite the protests of the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson), he is able to book a room for the night... What follows is a scary, insane and often thrilling journey into hell, as Enslin realizes that there are some truly evil forces at work in the room... And it will be a night which might cost Enslin his sanity... And perhaps his life.<br/><br/>Directed by Mikael Hafstrom (""Drowning Ghosts"", ""Shanhai""), and written by the writers of ""Halloween H20"" and ""Ed Wood"", this is a very stylish film. Hafstrom's camera-work is kinetic and vibrant and it's very beautiful to behold, and the writing is very witty and intriguing. The script is also smart in that it really delves into what makes Enslin tick as a character. And even though his story is simple and not particularly complex, it shows a lot of effort on the part of the writers to deliver to us an honest-to-god story and not just a CGI-filled extravaganza, so they get some serious points for creativity.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent. Cusack knocks his role out of the park (proving again his great range and realism), and supporting characters played by Samuel L. Jackson, Mary McCormack and Tony Shalhoub are marvelous. Broadway legend Len Cariou even has a few cameo appearances that make good use of his talent.<br/><br/>As a horror film, this movie does work very well. While it doesn't quite have the creep factor of the classics (mainly because it moves very quickly, and is a bit more in-your-face), it's still an extremely suspenseful film, and it does deliver some solid scares. It's eerie at times, and has a lot of roller-coaster moments. The best way to describe this movie is this- it's not terrifying, but it is pretty darned scary!<br/><br/>""1408"", while not perfect, is a great haunted-house style film. It has a lot of mystery, a lot of scares and thrills, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat! I give it a great 9 out of 10. (Just be warned, the Blu-Ray version of the film has a different ending than the theatrical cut, for some reason. Although the original ending is in the special features.)"

I felt John carried the film nicely and I was not bored at all like some claim they were.The effects were good, and the scene where Mike Enslin is walking along the outside ledge of the hotel 14 floors off the ground trying to escape had me panicking it was so real.I guess maybe it's my fear of heights but even now when I watch it on the DVD it's scary.SunburnM29 commented that they hated the ending because it was a typical Hollywood ending where Enslin shouldn't die because it would upset the audience.I agree with him and am grateful there is a director's cut with an alternate ending where the character does die instead of surviving the room.I prefer the alternate ending because it is more believable.The theatrical ending was stupid the way it ended. Now I want to read the Stephen King short story after watching both versions of this movie.I prefer the extended director's cut because the scene in the vent was longer and was explained better."

Some people may not like the ending but I thought it was like a good episode of ""The Twilight Zone.""<br/><br/>The thing I liked best about ""1408"" was that it is not just another haunted house. It is a customized portal into Hell that is made specifically for the inhabitant, in this case John Cusak. Also, the film has it's share of humor. The possessed clock radio in the room only plays The Carpenters. That must be Stephen King's idea of Hell.<br/><br/>If you have any inclination to see this film, you need to see it on the big screen. It is not going to translate well onto video. It stays away from the cheap tricks of other horror films and develops a creepy story instead. If you liked ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge,"" you will probably like ""1408."""

","Coulda been a contender, but just didn't take off. ""Boo"" thrillers like this should pick you up at the start and give you no time to think - just throw one shock at a time at you. This seemed almost static - every scare shot was telegraphed. Instatead of jumping out of my seat from surprise, I found myself thinking 'here comes another scare' and trying to guess what the scare would be. Even the twist at the end was clumsily edited - instead of grabbing you off kilter and making you jump, it was deliberately set up and held too long - multiple reaction shots from the two characters instead of scare - quick reax - black. leaving you breathing fast and your heart pounding. Quite a few careless and egregious continuity goofs also pulled me out of the movie repeatedly. <br/><br/>Liked Samuel L. Jackson, though - he had just the right combination of mystery and menace to leave you thinking about his role. Also, the quick pun in the beginning of the bellhop asking Mike if he could handle his ""baggage"" paid off nicely later in the film."
"imdb-3458","2","68","117","3 July 2007"," Am I missing something?
","After spotting the high rating on IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. Beyond that high rating, I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations.<br/><br/>Given my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary stuff.<br/><br/>First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts in a believable manner. He's freaked out. I'm encouraged and think to myself, this is going to be good. The people who made this movie understand that less is more.<br/><br/>But it's what happens next that was a big let down. The subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach... Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works. Let's see, a clock radio that turns on by itself? Good, that's always scary. Objects that move around in the room? Good, you can't complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sink? Great. Ghosts that commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises, shaking, fire, more shaking, messing up the room, more blood, etc etc. It's all good. And it's all been done before. Overstimulate our Attention Deficit Disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession, and they won't be able to look away.<br/><br/>Well, it didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I go see a horror movie in a theater, it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments. But this movie had no scary moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I felt no chill down my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be.<br/><br/>So who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just don't get it."

","Can you say ""All shock, no plot?"" There were so many unexplored directions in this movie. There was no history about the room other than the deaths. *WHY* was it evil? What made it that way? Why an ""hour"" countdown? Then, there were the unexplored things hinted at; for example we *saw* a camera in the air vent, which he mentioned. But when he climbed up said vent, there was no camera.<br/><br/>How about the fact that all the ghosts looked ""Digital"", and things ""winked out"" before hitting the ground making a static noise? Hmmm... when you put all of *those* things together, it makes room 1408 look like a high-tech spook house. Except that there was no follow up on that.<br/><br/>Oh... by the way... electronics don't work in 1408. Well, except for the TV... the cell phone has no signal, but Wireless Internet works fine. How many incontinuities can you possibly add? I'm sorry, but this film was nothing but ""shock after shock"". It's all been done before. Reflections in the mirror. Things just out of site. Changing paintings. Bleeding walls. The ""Oh, it was all just a dream... no it wasn't."" And, if the room was ""evil"", why make our main character come to terms with his daughter's death, if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway? It just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>Additionally, there was no background information about ""The first book"" that he wrote. Just some vague information about the ""dad was a jerk"" and so forth. Speaking of dads, what was with the bit about his father? ""You'll be in my place"".<br/><br/>Overall, a truly HORRIBLE movie. It was 100% adrenalin shock factor, without any new or innovative effects, and certainly no back story, character development, etc.<br/><br/>My overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the ""Cheap""; pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots, and was nothing but an effects film of recycled, cheesy, ""seen-that-before"" effects."

The answer: not much, just John Cusack having a long, drawn-out, mental breakdown.<br/><br/>Maybe if the Cusack character had more depth . . maybe if his freak-out were a more thorough reworking of his everyday life . . . maybe if the film had either better developed its half-baked themes about loss and faith or had not tacked them on in the first place . . . maybe if the film had made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrill-ride horror and had fully embraced one of these styles . . .

"vertigo_14","1","33","57","9 September 2007"," A hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. (spoilers)
","'1408' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. The kind that might make date-movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear, but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction.<br/><br/>John Cusak plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels. Despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal. When he learns of the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel--no wait, I mean, Dolphin Hotel in New York City--he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book. But, Samuel L. Jackson, playing the hotel owner, strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotel's opening many years ago. The story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, must sit through Jackson's lengthy foreshadowing ramble. <br/><br/>In other words: be afraid! Be very afraid!<br/><br/>Of course, it would be easy to convince audiences that they've just paid to see an edge-of-the-seat thriller if it didn't take so long to build up to this point. And also, if what followed was a lot more than cheap ""boos"" that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually, you might soon expect them. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls drip with blood. The fearless writer can't open the door, etc. And after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills, you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending. With suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time-wasters, even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over, we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable.<br/><br/>Despite grand performances (as always) by Cusak, who essentially is the entire film, most everyone else of note is wasted (i.e. Samuel L. Jackson) in insignificant minor roles. The true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating. Ballot-stuffing ghosts?"

","At first I must warn you – if you are looking for a good visual scare this will film definitely disappoint you. However, if you want to watch a well-structured thriller based on a bestseller written by Stephen King you have come to the right place. <br/><br/>I surely wouldn't categorize this movie as a horror, because it isn't as much about scaring the audience, as it is about presenting an insight into the darkest parts of a human mind. The fear accumulating in the picture is expected to come from the protagonist, not from the viewer. That is probably why people are often misjudging the whole idea of this highly intelligent plot. <br/><br/>A fearless writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack's great role), who specializes in debunking myths about various ghost-houses around the world, is sent to a seemingly regular Dolphin Hotel in New York to write another one of his stories. After acquiring information about the infamous room 1408, where several people had died throughout the years, he sends himself on a mission to clear the paranormal paranoia that surrounds this peculiar place. After ignoring all the warnings from the Hotel's manager (played by Samuel L. Jackson) he finally arrives in the room. Even though at first it seems that this is just another one of those tales created by some attention seekers, strange events start taking place. Writer's skepticism begins to fade away as he unravels more and more mysterious happenings occurring in 1408 (flood coming out of a painting on a high floor of a hotel? You got it).<br/><br/>Here I would like to specify that the events I'm talking about aren't just some easy-to-explain creations, designed by human hands. Mike certainly wouldn't fall for that, he is just too experienced. These strange tools of fear are developed by his mind, and through his own life stories. How else would you explain the fact that his late father and daughter suddenly appear inside the Hotel? His deepest and most intimate memories materialize in order to mess with his mind at an enormous pace. Unfortunately, there is no escape now. The door is closed. The phone isn't working. The clock is ticking. It seems that the room disappeared from the material world. The only person that he may be able to rely on is Lily, his wife, with whom he didn't have contact since the death of their daughter. She may be the key to his freedom<br/><br/>At one point in time you are sure that he somehow managed to escape, only to discover a few minutes later that this bizarre journey is about to start all over again. Has Mike lost his mind? Definitely. Even the toughest adventure hunters have their limits. What he saw in this hell of a place exceeded all his expectations. And it will exceed yours too. It will play with your emotions and make you realize that every one of us has that certain part of life that he would prefer to be long forgotten."

He decides to investigate an allegedly evil room at the Dolphin Hotel in New York City where numerous guests and hotel staff have been killed over the years, and for the first time confronts what he believes to be a genuine supernatural presence.

"SunburnM33","6","16","26","31 August 2007"," Almost, but not quite.
","I was really looking forward to this film, as the short story it's based on is one of King's classics, almost lovecraftian in its otherworldliness. Started off brilliantly, obviously director Mikael Hafstrom has been paying attention to the slow burn, anticipatory nature of Japanese horror. Cusack playing the embittered, alcoholic sceptic was an inspired bit of casting, as he was ideal for the role, pulling off what is essentially a one-man show. Unfortunately, like most Hollywood produced horror, it burns itself out just after halfway through, as if it doesn't know where to go. The wall-hugging sequence (obvious nod to Cat's eye) was inspired and then.. Dream sequence? Oh it was all a dream, NO, and I'm back in the room. Sorry, tired and lame there, if Bobby had walked out of the shower at that point I couldn't have cared less. The ending, well, COULD have been done so much better, if Enslin had died in the fire, allowing his wife to find the dictaphone and play back that message it would have been a fantastic ending, but, typical Hollywood, not allowing the protagonist to die for fear of upsetting people (I mean really, what could upset a horror fan?) In the story Enslin immolates himself to escape, the film gives him his wife back and a walking stick. So I'll give this one six skulls, and shame on Dimension for not having the guts to go with a decent, gritty, ending."

I know you have to add filler to turn a short story into a movie, but this was just insane. Scene after scene of a terrified looking John Cusak running between windows, in and out of the bathroom, squeezing through air vents. It was like watching an out of control train that never planned on crashing.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film there is foreshadowing of a bad relationship between Cusak's Enslin and his father, but with the exception of an unfulfilling 30 second scene in the bathroom there's no payoff.<br/><br/>It's like they decided to replace mean daddy with dead daughter. And THAT sucked. At no point did I need or want to see the apparition of his little girl walking her bloody feet over broken glass to ""die"" in his arms.<br/><br/>The ending wasn't so bad because at least he burns the room which is true to the story.<br/><br/>To all screenwriters: Stop adapting short stories into movies - it DOES NOT WORK!!!"

The directing is none-existent, the actors act without any feeling, the scenes makes dramatic jumps with no relevance at all and there is no atmosphere to grasp. <br/><br/>This movie is so bad that it's mostly harmless. I found my eyes seeking towards the furniture in the room where it played instead of looking at the screen because of the bizarre lack of any immersion.<br/><br/>But this isn't all. What frightened me the most is the unbearably bad basic character psychology. Cusack shifts mood like a confused chameleon, and the mood shifts are without any logics at all. At first he takes the role of an experienced and cool horror author but halfway through the movie he suddenly shifts to an hysteric wreck, and this hasn't been introduced the slightest.

Either way it HURTS; for days! <br/><br/>A day earlier we'd seen Universal's 1934 ""The Black Cat"" with horror superstars Karloff and Lugosi.

","John Cusack, you stole the show. Cusack's role as cult urban myth writer Mike Enslin is breathtaking and will have you wondering why he has been in such movies as Must Love Dogs and Serendipity. I can't say this enough: he absolutely steals the show. An amazing performance from him, combined with an immersive plot and great supporting acting from Samuel L. Jackson as the Dolphin Hotel's owner, creates a never before done ""horror"" film for the ages. I put horror in quotes due to the fact that this movie isn't a true horror film: meaning it doesn't follow the rules written so many times before it with movies like Saw and Friday the 13th part 85. Rather, it delves deep into a story of a man who simply cannot get out of a room filled with his own subconscious thoughts, ones that he must conquer and ones that he must learn to forget.<br/><br/>After spending a night in yet another ""haunted"" hotel somewhere in the rainy portions of the United States, Mike Enslin gets a postcard from the reclusive Dolphin Hotel in New York City with the words ""Don't stay in 1408"". Seeing it as a form of a challenge Enslin travels to New York, which coincidentally happens to be the residence city of his estranged wife, to spend a night in room 1408. He thinks it will make a good ending chapter for the book that he currently writing. After some arguing with the booking agent, he reserves a room in 1408 only to be told by the hotel manager that there have been numerous deaths and strange occurrences in that room since the hotel's opening. Not heeding the manager's warnings, Enslin decides to spend a night in the room just to see for himself. What follows is a shattering yet immensely interesting count of what happened to Mike Enslin in room 1408.<br/><br/>There are a few ""jump"" moments in this film, but nothing too bad. What really pulls you in the the way you seem to easily connect with Enslin from the beginning of the movie right through to the credits. He's a quirky yet comical guy with his own brand of satire and he seems convinces that ghost and ghoulies don't exist. He doesn't even believe in his own writing, as hypocritical as that is. Without spoiling the plot I can tell you this: the story is as immersive as the Stephen King short story of the same name; nothing is lost in the literature-movie transfer.<br/><br/>There are parts of this movie that are visually appealing as well and will have you gasping at what Enslin attempts to do to get himself out of the room. You will be sitting there with the movie paused, discussing with your friends what you personally would do if this would ever happen to you. The ending to this movie (I saw the Blu-ray ending, which is the original theatrical UK and European ending - the better one in my opinion) is fitting and concludes the awe-inspiring story with ease and will leave you with questions. Some will peak your curiosity so much that you may decide to sit down and read the short story that this movie is based off of. I highly recommend this.<br/><br/>All in all, 1408 is a dazzling display of cinema and Stephen King writing at its best. John Cusack's acting, along with the innovative plot, will keep you at the edge of your seat all the way to the sweet (or bitter) end.<br/><br/>+3 for Cusack<br/><br/>+3 for plot<br/><br/>+2 for supporting acting"

","Awful film, containing re-hashed ideas of earlier Stephen king based films, as well as terribly executed cinematography effects that I'm guessing were meant to match Hitchcock. I seen the vertigo shot (track in, zoom out; or vice versa) done about three times in this film, and each time it looked absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>John Cusack's whole character arc was simple enough to map out after the opening 5 minutes of the film, and subsequent development was little to none. With the action predominantly limited to one room, and one actor, the introduction of the Dictaphone was essential, yet increasingly became tedious. Without it we would of had a silent movie, or more likely just had Cusack going more and more mental, and jabbering on to himself more and more as the film progressed.<br/><br/>The presence of Samuel L Jackson, albeit a small presence, may help bring in a bigger audience for the film, and the few scenes with him in merit this as they are by far the best the film has to offer. Everything else is standard-chills horror, which lacks in both tension and ingenuity. If your wanting interesting ,intelligent, and somewhat scary horror, then avoid!

The storyline recalled me the lyrics of the Eagles' song ""Hotel California"" (""You can checkout any time you like, but you can never leave!"") and the plot is totally wasted with the awful conclusion that destroys the idea that Mike died while surfing and is living in hell due to his bad treatment to his father and to his wife after the death of his daughter.

","I expected pretty much nothing from this movie. Stephen King's book-to-movie adaptions have been hit (The Shining, Dreamcatcher) or miss (IT, Riding the Bullet) with me, and 1408 was never really my favorite story of his anyway. It was an eccentric, showy little tale that seemed to thrive on cheap thrills and insane, mind-boggling visuals rather than subtle horror, but it was fun for what it was. This movie is probably better than the story by a small margin, which is surprising. The reason for this is simple: Content. Being such a short story with characters that were not so fleshed out, Mikael Håfström had his work cut out for him making it into a full-fledged film. So he added some much-needed depth to it, giving Enslin a daughter and a wife, and adding some genuine tragedy to what would normally be a one-trick pony of a horror flick. The best scene in the entire movie was not even a part of the story (the scene where Cusack is holding his daughter, and she dies in his arms) which shows how well this one can stand on it's own.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the acting is all done extremely well, with John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson giving outstanding performances, and all of the supporting cast doing a great job as well. The directing is great, too, with the special effects and visuals clashing with the extended plot-line for the front of the stage. The tidal wave scene is especially cool, as are all the little scares you get in between the beginning and the end. The melting phone, the never-ending wall, the air duct, the ax-wielding ghosts...and of course the inevitable daughter scene. Everything is just so damn over the top and tremendous that it seems like some sort of parody of the more subtle and dark 'haunted house' films, but it's not---this is just the refinement of the old style, and a more laid back one at that. Not nearly as serious as something like Amityville all the time, and it works surprisingly.<br/><br/>Speaking of the scares, that's another surprise. This movie is actually pretty creepy. You won't want to stay in any hotel rooms for a while after this. While similar to Psycho and The Shining in the setting, this one is definitely more spastic and insane in all departments, and watching it with the lights off will no doubt yield amplified scares. It veers back and forth in a half-crazy lurch, and you're left questioning your sanity as you watch poor Cusack struggling to keep up with this 'evil f***ing room.' This isn't a film that moves at a slow pace. It goes for the throat, and succeeds, taking you by the jugular for almost two hours and never once letting up. This is one of the most effective horror stories I've seen since Into the Mouth of Madness in terms of scares. In fact, this film reminds me a lot of that one. When they end, you're left dazed and confused, wondering what the hell you just saw. An admirable quality.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I had to pick at, it'd be how the new plot elements with Cusack's deceased daughter don't always quite blend as well as they want to with the actual story of 1408. It's a bit schizophrenic. One minute it's telling you an over the top and spastic ghost story, and pleasing you with it's crazy visuals, but the next, you're made to feel sorry for Cusack, and your spine is chilled by his agonized cries as his daughter turns to dust in his arms. And then it goes back to more of the same crazy, upbeat scares that you loved so much. It's not bad, and it still works, but I was left feeling slightly disjointed after it was all done. The ending was very good though, and this movie is a satisfying, aesthetically-pleasing cornucopia of horror, amusement park-esquire thrills, and even a bit of tragedy that you shouldn't miss. Highly recommended."

","Stephen King may have his limitations as a writer but when he puts his mind to it, he can turn out a scary story. And I don't mind admitting that ""1408"" (the short story) scared me. Those familiar with King's work will recognize in this tale one of his longstanding obsessions: the Bad Place. Unpleasant things tend to happen to the people who stay in Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. The room isn't haunted, exactlyit's simply evil. And when a writer whose specialty is the debunking of the paranormal decides to spend a night in the notorious Room 1408well, if you haven't read the story I shall not spoil the experience for you. Suffice to say that King does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Because it is a short story, ""1408"" bears no trace of the gassy bloat that has spoiled so many of King's novels. For he is actually a better writer than we think; the problem is that since Stephen King became a brand, no one seems brave enough to edit him. And precisely because it is a short story, ""1408"" has been turned into a pretty crummy movie.<br/><br/>The problem with ""1408"" (the movie) is that King's economical tale had to be padded out to feature-film length with whiz-bang special effects and tedious plot complications. In the process, it just plain stopped being scary. One of the things about the short story that made it frightening was what may be called the uncertainty principle. Are the horrors experienced by the writer actually happening? Or are they all in his mind? Just what kind of monster is Room 1408? Wisely, King doesn't say. But in the movie this question is never even asked, much less answered.<br/><br/>I imagine that ""1408"" would have done very well as a ""Twilight Zone"" episode. As a feature film, it's pretentious and ultimately boring. My advice: forget the movie, but find the story and read it if you haven't done so already."
"springsunnywinter","1","13","24","29 December 2007"," Welcome to hotel hell?.......no thanks!!!
","First of all my comment doesn't have spoilers because there is absolutely nothing to spoil. The film is based on a short story by Stephen King. He is a very good writer and I have not red the story but the movie seems to have a very poor adaptation. There was no logic, structure; plot and I just don't know what's going on.<br/><br/>It wasn't entertaining or psychologically thrilling and also stupid e.g. If the room 1408 of the hotel is evil then why did the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson) keep the key safe instead of throwing it away? And giving it to someone after being persistently persuaded for barely 5 minutes.<br/><br/>There are 3 kinds of fear in a horror movie, 1: When the villain or monster is after someone. 2: The suspense or mystery of something bad that is about to happen. 3: The sudden ""BOO"" moment that makes you jump out of your seat. 1408 had absolute none of these and 1 + 4 + 0 + 8 = 13 wow so scary (sarcasm). Overall it was an absolute rubbish & disposable film that was forgotten in 15 minutes. The best horror movie of 2007 is Dead Silence."
"Okonh0wp","4","13","24","4 July 2007"," 1408 doesn't work on screen
","1408 is a thriller that sets few narrative rules for itself in trying to establish its thrills.<br/><br/>The premise established in an introduction that doesn't even try to hide the film's silliness is that a skeptical writer of ghost stories (John Cusack in a role that's miscast on the grounds that it resembles his persona in ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" too closely) travels to his latest conquest: not the usual haunted house but, instead, a room within an elegant hotel, that's said to be haunted. According to the hotel manager (Samuel L Jackson) the room is never checked out but the hotel chain wants to keep the outward appearance that there' nothing wrong with the room to make the other customers feel comfortable. Jackson's character tells Cusack's character incredible stories of how haunted the room and how once a maid stayed in the room too long and slit her wrists, or something like that in a scene that plays off as too melodramatic. The writer's cynicism is too strong for the hotel manager's appeal and he decides to take the room. Of course once he gets there, bad things happen but the audience can see that coming from a mile away.<br/><br/>What 1408 ultimately comes down to is an adaptation problem. The film was adapted from Stephen King's short story which probably worked great as an Edgar Allen Poe-type exploration of the darker recesses of the human mind. On screen, however, the mobius strip plot contraptions wear thin. With nearly everything on screen happening only in the character's mind, there's little reason to care."

","Mr.Enslin please don't do this The last words said to him before he enters room 1408. #Chills running down spine#<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) a published author of some great horror novels has a very authentic method of inspiration. His inspiration lies in the experience of the deep dark world spirits. Yet to have a confrontation with an evil spirit Enslin is a non-believer who twists his tales to come up with some great novels. Enslin receives a post card on a bright sunny morning that warns him of room 1408. What's Room 1408? Located in New York City, at the Dolphin hotel, room 1408 has never missed on devouring its paying customers into its deepest darkest corners and none have left alive. This sort of tease is just the exact thing Enslin is looking for. Just like Adam ate from the tree he was not supposed in the Garden of Eden, Enslin wanted nothing more than to check into room1408. Hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel Jackson) who has seen and lived through some of the grotesque moments of the handy work of the evil in the room denies Enslin at point blank in the most polite of manners. The adamant and stubborn writer persuades the manager and finally wins the debate and gains the keys to the room. In a room where no one has spent over an hour and lived to tell the story, would Mike Enslin survive a night?<br/><br/>The low lying Hollywood man who is not new to this genre of movie making runs a one man show. Without a doubt the lions' share of the movie is for John Cusack. If you have watched him in Identity you will know before you pop the DVD in that he is a man with taste for this kind of a hunt. What he does exceptionally well in Identity back in 2003 he does it all over again SOLO in 1408. Taking up a role in a horror movie is always a great challenge and to take up one where you're the entire movie needs a lot of guts. If the movie does fail, it's all on you but in this case when it's a success, you know you got talent. I am sure we have all watched the box office slop and remake of the once great The Nightmare on Elm Street well this is exactly what 1408 is not! What that room does to Cusack is believable on so many different levels and his convincing approach makes me want to switch the lights on in my apartment as I am watching it. # Yes I am scared, yes I am a grown man, but watch it if your laughing at this point, I will give you some tips on how to in a while #. We all agree that a climax in a movie is what makes it or breaks it. How many of those sordid movies that never should have been made have we walked away just because the ending made a decent wrap up? Hanna is one that I felt was a waste of time until the ending swept me away. It's a devious approach the producers and directors play on us! So getting back to where I am coming from, the build up to the events, the screen time Samuel Jackson puts up with John Cusack is intense and it's safe to say a bit spooky. Samuel Jacksons' convincing hotel manager gets your fear all built up. That voice alone and those vicious eyes in that dark suit drive those nails right into the coffin of horror. The deal is sealed. Does it unveil well? That's entirely your decision.<br/><br/>Tips on how to watch a horror flick<br/><br/>I have met many a major heroes who say, horror movies are for the weak. I have had people say The Ring dumbest movie I have seen! That's not scary. So my next question is where you watched it? The most common answer is oh last afternoon at home or last evening with a bunch of friends. I agree movies need to be watched a with a crowd to share the sense of entertainment, but if you're watching it for the chills and if you really want to see if you have the heart of a lion, follow the next few tips.<br/><br/>1. ALWAYS watch a horror movie alone ( I am trying to prove a point here)<br/><br/>2. The only light that should be switched on in your apartment should be the TV<br/><br/>3. The apartment needs to be empty. ( It's not exactly a very brave thing to be in the TV room all by yourself when you got 25 family members in the next room)<br/><br/>4. Try not to be disturbed. Make sure you have everything you need right beside your for 120 minutes, Soda, sandwich etc.<br/><br/>5. NOW YOU TELL ME IF YOU'RE STILL NOT AFRAID. If you are, welcome to the world of horror, if your still not, good for you!<br/><br/>Title: 1408 Directed by: Mikael Hafstorm Starring: John Cusack & Samuel L Jackson Rated: Rated PG-13 for thematic material including disturbing sequences of violence and terror, frightening images and language Rating: 07/10 104 Minutes"

"PanamaJoe","1","11","20","15 December 2007"," Awesomely bad
","OK, first things first, let's get this out of the way - 1408 is not a good movie. Nor is it a scary movie. It's actually a terrible movie. But that's what makes it awesome.<br/><br/>For those of you who haven't read Everything's Eventual, the excellent short story collection that 1408 first appeared in, let me fill you in - 1408 was no more than 20 pages long. This means a ratio of 5.2 minutes per page. This is a formula that has rarely worked for King (witness The Lawnmower Man), and here it falls flat on its face.<br/><br/>Most of the value of the original story was in the quality of the writing. I remember that, at the time, it actually made me scared. I was like, ""Wow, that's pretty creepy."" But this movie - not scary. Not even a little bit. <br/><br/>They use every single cliché in the horror movie book - bleeding walls, dead relatives, guys with claw hammers, trick mirrors. In a particularly classy move, they appropriated the ledge sequence from an earlier King movie. In fact, I think that movie was called The Ledge.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is definitely one of those movies that's so bad it's funny. I love how the Room of Terror has a clock radio that only plays The Carpenters. I remember thinking to myself, ""You know what, that's just about right."" It was a trip watching John Cusack (!) play the ""Cynical Burnt-Out Writer"" archetype. And the painfully expository scenes with the wife! ""After she died, you left, and I haven't talked to you in a year! And now we're not even divorced, we're 'seperated!' I'm like, ""way to spell that out!"" you know? <br/><br/>So, in the end, watch this movie if it's one of those nights when you want to make fun of a movie with someone. Or I don't know. It looks like a lot of people here think that it was actually scary. Well, in any case, I had fun with it, even though I thought it was kinda really bad."
"zetes","5","11","20","24 June 2007"," Decently entertaining up until the end, but then it just gets dumb
","The least good film I've seen so far from 2007, but that's mostly because I've been lucky and have avoided things that looked particularly awful. In reality, 1408 is just mediocre. John Cusack stars and basically owns the screen for its 94 minutes as an author who writes about hauntings. He doesn't himself believe in the stuff he writes about, but is glad to fleece a gullible audience. But when he discovers room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City, he has met his match. It is haunted, and apparently by a semi-talented Hollywood FX crew that doesn't know the meaning of the phrase ""less is more"". Hollywood just doesn't realize that loud effects are not especially scary. Ghost stories in particular are at their best when they're quiet and spooky. That said, much of the film falls into the category of a decent afternoon at the movies. Cusack, a favorite of mine, is very good throughout. The early scenes between him and Samuel L. Jackson, who has a rather tiny role as the manager of the hotel, are particularly good. The two play off each other perfectly (the best part of the movie comes later on when a tiny Sam Jackson appears in John Cusack's mini-bar  not meant to be funny, but it's hilarious). The haunting scenes happen too quickly and come on too heavily, but there are a couple of moments that made me jump. And there's a moderately clever mislead near the end of the film (which is obvious, especially if you've seen the trailer, but which works for the most part). But the climax and end are incredibly bad, ruining even the small amount of fun I had had. Before I finish, I have one complaint about something else that really bothered me: what the heck was with the digital ghosts? The ghosts look like some sort of digital holograms. How is this in any way frightening? It just looked odd."

During the ten part conclusion, I wondered if perhaps it was I that was stuck in room 1408, destined to watch this overcooked tripe until the end of my days.<br/><br/>Put your popcorn back in the cupboard, switch off the lights in your entertainment room, warm up your favourite reading sofa and tell your friends that movie night has been cancelled. Unless you're in the business of disappointment, you do not want to watch this.<br/><br/>The only good thing that can come from sitting down in front of this steaming pile of feces is the potentially attractive nurse you may meet at the emergency ward as you explain to your medical insurance representative that slitting your wrists was the only viable alternative to watching the show through to its mind numbing, skull crushing, Sunday night day before school, skin on fire, homework not done, wish-it-were-still-the-holidays end."

I wasn't shook up, it didn't make me think, it didn't make me reach for the light switch as fast as I could when walking into a dark room. The aftertaste is...weak. On the way home I felt - blank.<br/><br/>The second thing about this film is the gradation which is completely wrong - the scariest scene hits you at about midpoint of the film. Later on the things that the main character experiences may indeed be the worst thing imaginable for him, but it's just plain boring and annoying for the viewer. I'm sorry but I just don't buy that sentimental crap. So it's kind of watered down.<br/><br/>That's about that, from what I recollect. Everything else is a thick feeling of indifference.<br/><br/>A lame horror with lots of loud noises and special effects, not the finest hour for L. Jackson and J. Cusack. Story flawed, tricks cheap.

","I went into this film with high expectations. I had heard some good buzz on this, and being a Stephen King fan, I went in with high hopes. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. The movie opens, and I have to admit, I was a bit worried based on the really cheesy dialog, but figured the scares were coming soon enough, and maybe I would see past that. Well, the scares NEVER came! <br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, concerns a writer (John Cusack) who investigates ""Paranormal"" activity in supposedly haunted hotel rooms around the country. What he finds however is always a tourist trap to lure people to out of the way hotels, whose glory days are long past. While researching his next trip, he receives an invite to the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan. Yet another wild goose chase so he thinks, but when he checks into the hotel and tries to reserve room 1408, the supposedly haunted room, he is met by the hotel manager, (Sam Jackson in a phoned in performance) Paycheck anyone!? who tries to convince Cusack to take another room as no one has lasted more than an hour in that room. The manager conveniently hands Cusack a fat folder on all the suicides, and dead bodies found in 1408. Nothing will stop Cusack from writing his story. So away we go...<br/><br/>This is where I thought the scares would come in and was I ever disappointed. Pedestrian ""scares"" that a first year film student would know better than to try! So utterly boring is this turd that the only reason I stayed up to watch it, is because I was already in too deep. The room tries to mess with Cusack by turning radios on and off, and turning the heat up! Wow! Scary! Puhlease...The subplot concerning Cusack's dead daughter is really boring and the ending, if you make it that far, is ridiculous, and so cheap, you wonder why people didn't ask for their money back after leaving the theater. <br/><br/>As far as haunted house stories go, check out an episode of the 70's anthology series ""Night Gallery"" called ""A Question of Fear"" starring Leslie Nielsen as a mercenary who is bet $15,000 he can't spend one night in a haunted house.

The scenes that follow did not make me doubt that he was still in the room, because of too many suggestive hints that he was. Boring! Some moments were thrilling, but there was no build-up of tension in this story. I found the reaction of the main character to the terrors in the room unnatural, I could not relate to the character.

Cusak gives an OK performance, but the director does not manage to create an unsettling atmosphere for the story. 1408 is not a horror movie and the PG-13 rating does not help at all. <br/><br/>It is difficult to create an effective horror story nowadays, especially to a generation that either gets scared on teen slasher films or the opposite, grizzly violence and torture films. 1408 does none of the above, but tries to explore supernatural phenomena failing undoubtedly. It takes more than computer generated ghostly images and a sense of madness to develop an effective horror film. For example, Dario Argento, captured the essence of the supernatural in his films Suspirira and Inferno. But one does not have to go back to the 70s or 80s to find good horror movies... some recent great horror: House of 1000 Corpses, Dog Soldiers, Cabin Fever, Hostel, May, 28 Days Later.<br/><br/>1408 delivers nothing special for the passionate horror connoisseur."

","I went to the movie on a rare night out with my husband hoping to have a great time and be a little spooked. We both walked away disappointed and wishing we had picked a different film. Maybe my expectations were too high because of all the great user reviews this film got but I have to disagree with the majority. We weren't scared at all. I think we jumped once when a ghost popped out but that was just because of surprise..nothing scary. We were both having a hard time trying to stay awake and we found ourselves just wishing it would hurry and end! I would say more but I just feel like I am wasting my time on this pointless film. Don't compare it to The Shining because it doesn't even come close! Sorry."

","The movie attracted me because of 2 reasons  Samuel Jackson and Stephen King.<br/><br/>The story is about an author Mike Enslin (John Cusack) who does not believe in ghosts and as part of his search to see ghost, his work is to go and stay in haunted hotels so that he can write books like ""10 nights in haunted hotels"". Mike selects a famous New York Hotel Dolphin; room number 1408 to spend a night. The reason is, in that hotel 56 people have died in past 40 years, and nobody has survived for more than 1 hour in the hotel room. Mike Enslin checks in the hotel and experiences ghost, but survives the 1 hour.<br/><br/>The build up to the movie was good. But once John Cusack is inside the room and the Director Mikael Hafstrom starts using usual gimmick and tricks to scare the audience, the movie falls flat on its face. Personally I did not find a single scene in the movie that was scary. There was no suspense too in the unfolding of the story. Whatever happens is so expected that I did not experience any thrill.<br/><br/>John Cusack shows some signs of good acting, but he is not able to rise above the poor scripting.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson was playing the minor insignificant role of Hotel Manager - Not much to write about any department of the movie.<br/><br/>If the purpose was to scare the audience with ghost experience, the director fails in scaring audience. The movie according to me is a dud! (Stars 2 out of 10)"
"filmmaestro","4","9","17","3 July 2007"," Not a ""truly great horror film""
","The movie deserves credit for not relying on gore, which comes by the truckload with contemporary horror fare. And Cusack's performance is, as usual, not disappointing. These two things aside, the film suffers from the typical components of generic Hollywood stories where you have a protagonist haunted by an emotionally-damaging past, and who by the end of the film somehow sheds his old skin and becomes happy again. Honestly I felt annoyed by this not just because none of this was in King's story but because it is so typical of the studio films. Once the family drama starts up, you know that sappy scenes of his failed family life are going to be peppered across the film to make it more palatable for the masses. Consequently it becomes highly predictable. <br/><br/>The written version of the story by Stephen King is excellent but doesn't entirely lend itself to the screen. After all nearly all of the story takes place in one room and with one character. Its nuances make it so terrifying, the small things occurring in the room. The movie, however, relies on hokey ideas like cracked walls with blood dripping through, an inexplicable ghoul in the air shaft, visits in the room from the protagonist's dead family members, and the utter demolition of the space not just once, not twice, but three times. At times it felt like a Three Stooges movie directed by Franz Kafka.<br/><br/>To gage a film's quality try looking at what it grossed in the box office its second week compared to its first. I think this one dropped 75%. Still, some people seem to like this film. It's not a bad attempt on the King story. But if you are looking for something unique, you'll feel like you wasted your money on this one."

","Being a big Stephen King fan,and particularly of this short story, I was really looking forward to this movie. Yes, Cusack portrayed the cynical world-weary side of his character quite well, but his descent into mental instability while in room 1408 was like watching an old silent movie actor. Every action and emotion was exaggerated to the point of silliness, hasn't Hollywood heard of the phrase, 'less is more'? The over-the-top acting was combined with really cheesy effects - I mean, blood seeping through the walls? And coming out of the sink? What was with all the water? I thought at one point I was watching 'Titanic'! This film could have been done so, so much better. All the psychological subtleties of King's story seemed to have been abandoned in pursuit of shallow effects and un-shocking shocks."

","This movie scares anyone. Even people who are not usually scared by horror movies. I had to turn it off at night and watch it in the morning because I was scared. It's heart-stopping. Warning though: If you're looking for violent blood-splatting thrills, this is not the movie. But if you're looking for a pop-out thrill ride with chilling images and mind-bending elements,this is the movie for you. John Cusack is doing a one man show most of the whole movie and I gotta say that he should have gotten a golden globe or Oscar for best actor. He was that good. He's an underrated actor who deserves credit. He lets you know he needs to get out of the room, and even though it's risky, he thinks it over and makes your heart stop with his Tour De force performance. One problem I had with this movie was the marketing campaign. Two of them. The trailer made me think this was going to be another Shining, just a copy of it. But I was wrong, of course. 2nd one was that Samuel L. Jackson was acting like an important character in this considering the posters with his face next to Cusack and trailers seeming that he might be evil, but really, he's in there for about 6-10 minutes. So he's really not that important. That's probably the only problem I had with this movie. I loved it, best psychological horror movie I have ever seen.A must see. 9/10."

","Based on a short story by Stephen King, this spooky movie starts out strongly intriguing but unfortunately lapses into tedium and predictable situations. John Cusack is at first interesting as an atheistic author who believes in practically nothing, and has published books on haunted hotels and other such spiritual phenomena. He then insists on spending a night in an ""evil"" New York City hotel room numbered 1408, which has had a long history of unexplained deaths and madness for nearly a century, and has subsequently been closed to the public. Samuel L. Jackson matches wits with Cusack as the adamant hotel manager who does everything he can to dissuade the cynical writer from his research, but guess who wins out? Too bad things sink rapidly into clichés once Cusack settles in for the evening. No spoilers revealed here, but since we pretty much know what's going on between Cusack and 1408, it's hard to be very impressed or terrified. Instead, it's only a matter of how much we are required to endure before it ends. ** out of ****"

","This is perhaps one of the best horror films of our generation. I don't normally write reviews nor do I often give movies good ratings, but I felt this one deserved the praise.<br/><br/>1408 is a riveting mind bending psychological thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. A brilliant visionary work of art. An inescapable terrifying nightmarish scenario. It will have you gasping for breath, and yet the brilliance of the story and plot will grace you with a fond feeling of pure satisfaction upon completion of your movie going experience.<br/><br/>John Cusack put on what some might say was an Oscar worthy performance. Samuel L. Jackson also played a convincing albeit small role as well. For the most part, however, 1408 was a one man show and in that usually drab aspect it somehow thrived.<br/><br/>The good majority of the film (nearly 90% I'd say) is shot in the room despite what the trailers would have you think. This may be a turn off to some, but in the eyes of a veteran movie goer it was pure brilliance. A difficult to utilize cinematic idea that was somehow perfected.<br/><br/>It tests the limits of a PG-13 rating as far as the level and quality of horror goes. 1408 is perhaps the scariest PG-13 horror film since The Ring, or possibly, dare I say, of All-Time. And I've seen just about every horror flick you can name...<br/><br/>The ending is where most seem to have their gripes. However, in my opinion it couldn't have ended any better. It was a bone chilling eye opening ending that shifted the supernatural-psychosis theme in a sudden confirmed finality testing the legitimacy of a perceived reality. Terrific!! <br/><br/>It wasn't the booze after all...<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10, I'd have to give it a perfect 10. Perhaps the ONLY movie I've given a 10 to in the last decade, with the exception of V for Vendetta and the original Matrix.<br/><br/>The direction is a bit wary but close to perfection. The best you can get from an adaptation of a SHORT story, that is. Of course it may seem a bit prolonged and meandering to those that read and exalted the original story expecting an exact adaptation. My suggestion is to view it independently, not interchangeably and you'll find yourself enjoying this terrific Oscar worthy film.<br/><br/>In a sea of unworthy next gen horror films, 1408 stands alone as the candle in the dark.<br/><br/>1408 -- DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING IN TO!!"

","There is a reason why Stephen King's books are usually good while their movie adaptations usually aren't. King has one main strength as a writer: a vivid, crisp prose. Unfortunately, aside from dialogues, that's the one aspect which doesn't translate from page to screen.<br/><br/>The plot of 1408 could be written on a stamp: skeptical writer Mike (John Cusack) - the usual King protagonist, a talented, hard-drinking, cynical novelist (how original, Steve!) - rents an infamous haunted room in a New York hotel and finds himself trapped there as Bad Things Start To Happen.<br/><br/>Cusack is reliable, turning in an entertaining performance. The setup is fine: the conversation between Mike and the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson, wasted, as is Tony Shalhoub) is tight and well-written, with compelling performances and King's excellent ear for dialogues. <br/><br/>And still, the result is mediocre fluff. 1408 pulls too many punches to be scary. When Mike desperately peers through the keyhole, I wanted a sharp blade to poke him in the eye. I wanted a rabid dog to come out of the picture on the wall and jump at his throat. I wanted the ghost of his dead daughter to be a vampire-like presence. I wanted the firemen at the end to remain trapped inside room 1408. <br/><br/>Nothing of the sort happens - it's a tame PG-13 horror with a couple of mildly unsettling ""boo!"" vignettes.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Director Mikael Hafstrom creates an eerie, fast-paced, tense thriller here about a cynical writer of haunted homes and hotels that goes to the Dolphin Hotel in New York City to investigate the paranormal attributes of a specific room - 1408. Based on a short story by Stephen King, 1408 delivers in terms of genuine scares, psychological horror, and first-rate special effects. John Cusak plays the writer who has been jaded by what the hand life has dealt him with charisma, wit, and and great skill. Cusak's Mr. Enslin is very believable and that is so necessary for a film that is relies so heavily on one performance - for you see, Cusak is acting against the room throughout the bulk of the film. An evil room that has been responsible for 56 deaths. Supporting performers are very good as well with Samuel Jackson giving a high-octane performance as the manager of the hotel pleading Cusak to not stay in this room. The film is shot with breathtaking attention to detail. The hotel itself has a life of its own as does the dreaded room. The script keeps you guessing what will happen and many might object to what they might perceive as a lack of real explanation by the film's close. This ending was just right I thought for a thriller based on so many psychological elements. 1408 is a rare horror treat these days with its innovative story, solid acting, and reliance on the viewer's imagination(to some degree at least)."
"GazTruman","3","10","21","5 September 2007"," An awful attempt at a 'man escaping from room' film.
","1408 is a film about a guy who is portrayed to be not scared of anything, within 30 minutes, he turns into a 17 year old, blonde, cheerleader from scream 3. I can honestly say i don't have many positive words to describe this film, it resembles the number 23 and one or two scenes reminded me of this. Certain scenes such as one near the beginning where the main character is signing autographs in books seems to have no point within the film, I thought the girl who seemed to be his biggest fan was going to come in to it later on, however the chat she had with him seemed completely pointless. One of the most painful parts of the film was when the main character was trying to escape from the room by screaming, the camera panned around and the face expression of the actor was much to be desired  it looked awful! I would have been quite happy for the film to of ended when the main character woke up on the beach for the 2nd time, as if the previous 45mins were all a dream. Don't get me wrong would not of saved the film, but would of prevented me from the pain of watching a father and daughter crying in each others arms in the most untouching manner. Sorry paramount but I have literally no idea why you agreed to distribute this movie, and as for Samuel L.Jackson, I think this can go down as one of the films I will try to forget you ever took part in. A final note would be save your money & buy the first 'saw' movie if you want to watch characters escape from a room with mystery."

","I was excited to see 1408. All of the previews made it seem that this would be another great entry from Stephen King into the horror genre. However, I left the theater absolutely furious.<br/><br/>While walking out with a friend, I commented, ""I feel like I'm going to go home, sit down, do some things, start seeing random people from the movie theater and then be transported back into the theater and forced to watch that movie again. Then someone will say, 'You can either relive the experience of watching 1408, or you can burn the theater to the ground to escape'"". I would definitely choose the latter.<br/><br/>One character, in one room, for an hour and a half. It was Phone Booth without the brilliant acting. There were thinly veiled attempts to string together a plot, but in the end I could only see the film making three valid points. One, that today's movie goers are all about style over substance - preferring cheap thrills and cool visual effects over actual plot and solid acting. Two, if you are ever in a hotel room that is trying to make you commit suicide, just sarcastically mock the evil, demonic force in the room - ""Be David Caruso in Jade"" - and it can't do anything to you. Three, if you are ever in said hotel room, there is never a good reason to go near the window.<br/><br/>Sam Jackson was an unnecessary addition, as was Tony Shaloub (whose part last about 10 seconds). I think I preferred ""13 Ghosts"".<br/><br/>John Cusack delivered an admirable performance, however it was like watching the captain of a sinking ship doing everything possible to save his boat before it finally went under. He just couldn't carry this film by himself. Everyone in this movie over-acted and Mr. Cusack was no exception.<br/><br/>Overall, a brutal brutal movie. 2/10"

This movie got it right, even with additions to the original story. It's not one of those gross-out shockers, but one of those things where you leave the theatre going with goosebumps and an intention to never stay at a hotel again. It messes with your head and, personally, I'm still not sure how much of what happened in Room 1408 happened as a supernatural occurrence or inside of John Cusack's character's head, even with the resolution that it was all real in the ending.<br/><br/>And I did like the ending, although I see some complaints with it. I honestly don't see how it could have ended any other way.<br/><br/>John Cusack - well, I LOVE him! Talk about an underrated actor. He was amazing in this movie. He had to carry it, since most of the movie revolves around him in the room and he pulled if off superbly.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. If you're a fan of ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" - this movie may not be for you. Personally, I hate those sorts of movies because I don't really find them scary - they rely on the shock and gore factor, but they lack substance. 1408, though, this one will stay with you for awhile."

","***CONTAINS SPOILERS*** I had really high hopes for this picture. Stephen King's short story of the same title, from the book Everything's Eventual, is easily the best story in that collection of very, very good stories. However, this movie falls really far from the mark.<br/><br/>Before seeing it, I decided that I would give the estranged wife/deceased daughter subplot a chance, even though I doubted it would add anything to the story. I also thought that Samuel L. Jackson was a poor choice as the hotel manager Olin (not that I don't love Mr. Jackson, but the casting seemed wrong.) John Cusack as Mike Enslin seemed like a fine choice...<br/><br/>But, even accepting that this is a loose adaptation of the short story, the movie fails as horror movie or thriller on it's merits (or faults.) Most of it seemed like a sloppy conglomeration of recent horror films tactics (the herky-jerky ghosts with old-film patina, creepy-looking, fluorescent-lit ""hospital room,"" a resurrected love one that isn't who she seems, a Shamaylan-esquire enfilade of ""twists, etc.) I felt like a was watching a parody of en vogue horror film techniques, not a movie that was seriously trying to be scary.<br/><br/>What's more, everything that made the short story so terrifying was relegated to the background or omitted entirely, starting with the hotel room door that appears off-kilter before righting itself, and then leaning in th other direction. The changing pictures, the changing room service menu, the changing light, the creepy ruminations into the tape recorder of a man loosing his mind (""My brother was eaten by wolves on the Connecticut turnpike!""), the ""electric razor that learned to talk"" voice shouting from the telephone receiver (""This is Nine! NINE! All your friends are DEAD!), none of these are here or, if they are, they're little more than afterthoughts. What the movie does have--the walk on the ledge of the building, the dream sequence of getting out, the dead daughter--are weak, poorly realized, and not at all scary.<br/><br/>King's work tends to translate very poorly into film. With the exception of Shawshank, The Green Mile, and TV mini-series version of The Shining, Stephen King movies range from big disappointments to downright awful. A big part of this the length of his books; they require so much truncation to fit into a 90-120 minute movie that they can't help but end up shadows of their former selves. Had it been written page for page from the short story, 1408 could have a made an authentic and truly terrifying 100-or-so-minute movie. As it is, it is crammed full of a lot of ineffectual crap an stripped of what made the story so effective; the uncomprehending terror of a man who is not so slowly slipping into madness."

","What is it about movies based on the Works of Steven King? There's always two types made: The first is the classic to phenomenal such as Carrie, Cujo, The Shawshank Redemption, and the Green Mile (and don't write me about the different pen names used for the last two, it's still King no matter what he wrote it under). The second, and unfortunately most common, are the movies that come out hum-drum, hackneyed, and even just plain dull and lame, I'll give you a hint as to which category 1408 belongs to, it's the category closer to this sentence. Don't get me wrong King is a great writer by all means, but for some reason eight out of nine times movies based on his work fall like a midget off a bar stool, short and with a nauseating thud. Let's now take a short time to discuss the reasons for this using 1408 as an example.<br/><br/>Cast: John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson take the lead credits in this movie. Both of which in their own rights are good actors, Cusack is a fine actor and Jackson is the single greatest angry black man in Hollywood. I don't mean that in any racist sense so don't take it that way, it's just I can't give him title of best angry man period in Hollywood as long as R. Lee Ermey is still alive, GOT THAT MAGGOT!? Where was I? Oh yes, Jackson's role in this was far from angry and loud taking away some of his best qualities, more so his actual role in 1408 was about as significant as whole bread, cause until it was sliced, no one seemed to care. As for Cusack, this movie seemed to be more of a one man show starring him trying to play a person slipping into insanity and coming out like someone slipping into an undersized Easter bunny suit on Christmas, mildly amusing but rather missing the point. The best part of this movie was when the both Cusack and Jackson were on the scene at the same time, this was amusing and fun to watch as they both played well off of each other in a battle of the greater smart ass competition, but this was in fact very short in this movie.<br/><br/>Plot: Have you seen the previews? If so you've seen the plot. Outside of what was in the previews 1408 has about as many twists and turns as a north Texas highway, and if you've never driven a north Texas highway this equates to exactly zero, and if you have, I am sorry for your ordeal. Outside of that, there's not much else to say about plot.<br/><br/>Horror: This movie is touted as a horror movie, and in doing so manages to be about as scary as children dressed as Raggedy Ann and Andy on Halloween Scratch that actually, children dressed as Raggedy Ann and Andy terrify the hell out of me now that I think about it. It's like animated clown puppets out to steal your sweets and egg your house. On second thought let's compare it more to a Chihuahua in a sombrero, mildly amusing and while it may have teeth, come on it's a Chihuahua worst case scenario you'll end up with wounds less severe than if you cut yourself shaving.<br/><br/>Special Effects: I think there were supposed to be some in this movie, I'm not sure... I think the third string special effects unit on a Troma movie could have done a better job. Let me rephrase that, the effects weren't horrid, they just weren't there, and aside from a couple of educational film quality ghosts there wasn't anything in the movie that couldn't be reproduced by a bored kid and a camcorder.<br/><br/>Final Notes: While I did come down hard on this movie, as it is more fun to do, it was not the worst movie I've ever seen either, it was just a far, far, far cry from the best. For that reason I decided to get creative with rating it. 1: Definitely better than a one. 4: Slightly below average but so was the movie. 0: Not even a valid option. 8: Not even close.<br/><br/>Therefore, I give this movie a semisolid, somewhat gelatinous 4. I will note that despite all I have said, if you like this movie, don't take this as an attack, we all like different things, it just lacked something overall for my taste. For me, despite a decent cast and a decent original story writer, this movie was about as far off par as Tiger Woods if he were blind and on crack."

I once enjoyed Stephen King books; I read 19 of them before i realised his characters were repetitively corny American stereotypes, and his idea of ""horror"" was neither horrific nor scary, it was just cheesy. I don't know whether the book was as cr*p as this adaption, but please already! my god, how much cheese does a person need before dying of cholesterol poisoning! <br/><br/>There are 2 endings to this film, but on the official DVD version the main character is killed. On a version i watched months ago the lead dude survived! The last scene was him back with his wife discovering his daughters voice on the tape recorder which suggested that his experience had been real - it was the only moment of 'class' in the entire film - and IT MADE SENSE!! But with the DVD ending it's Samuel Jackson's character listening to the tape recorder after the lead dudes funeral, and then we get another ""surprise!""-burned-person moment in the car. So now the ""surprise!""-burned-person ""ghost"" is in the car? You morons it was the ROOM that was meant to be ""evil"", the ""ghosts"" were directly attached to the room! You chose the wrong ending to put on the DVD!<br/><br/>Remember Green Mile? Shawshank Redemption? I want that kind of classy approach to a horror film! Watch ""The Others"" or ""The Changeling"" and you'll know how subtlety can win out over crud like 1308 (that's minus the 100 minutes i just reclaimed..)."

The scene at Hermosa Beach, because I was in the same location last summer on vacation and I recognized it. <br/><br/>2. The alarm clock in the room that was set for the countdown.<br/><br/>The rest was just plain boring and pointless.

","Writer John Cusack specializes in books about haunted houses. He is inexplicably sent a postcard telling him to stay out of the titled place, located in a hotel in New York City. Naturally, Cusack becomes intrigued as he thinks he will prove the room to be harmless as with the other so-called haunted places he has encountered. Cusack though is a bit of a lost soul himself, leaving his wife (Mary McCormack) after the death of their young daughter. Strange little flick which is based on a short story by Stephen King. Basically ""1408"" turns into a nutty one-man show that just kind of spins frantically into nothing. Plot holes galore will turn most viewers off very quickly and Samuel L. Jackson's creepy hotel manager could have been eliminated from the final product all together. Intermediate film-making scares may frighten those who have not seen a movie since 1933, but the rest of us will be yawning instead. Totally forgettable. 2.5 stars out of 5."

","When the horrific content of this movie was triggered by a Carpenter's song, I thought to myself, ""This is going to be some scary ____."" This is true because as we all know the Carpenter's were the epitome of evil. 1408 was a well acted movie. Mr. Cusack, Mr. Jackson and all the other folk did an outstanding job. BUT, this movie lacked something. The ultimate reason we have movies is to be entertained. Each movie tries to do this in its own special way. When I can sit and name the movie that the particular gag is from and I am doing so while watching the movie, is the movie doing its job? Call it an overactive imagination, boredom, or what have you; when the story is not engulfing me, I am not entertained. Or am I? So it wasn't original. So it wasn't particularly frightening (except the carpenters). So what I didn't care about this poor man's back-story. So what if I was wondering if I had left the iron on (especially ironic since I don't own one). I laughed a couple of times. The movie did have a pretty good visual style. It did have some jump in your seat moments, I'll give it that. I am not a particular fan of using extremely loud sound cues to try to frighten me. This movie, like so many in recent cinematic history, seemed to have to tell you where to be scared by giving you the audible cue. I don't feel as if I was witness to the best movie, nor was I witness to the best horror film. I also don't feel as if I was cheated. I just left feeling unfulfilled, the sort of feeling I get when I go to get my favorite ice cream and they are out of it, so I take second best. The experience was still a good one, definitely worth having, it just was not quite as satisfying as I would have liked."

When I heard that King himself liked this, (that's gotta mean something)I had to go see this. Here's my take:<br/><br/>1408 is quite creepy. Enter Mike Enslin(John Cusack) who is a writer. On his latest book, he wishes to finish it with going to the Dolphin Hotel to enter room 1408. Despite his determination, the hotel manager Gerald Olin(Samuel L. Jackson) does not want another person killed as 1408 has a death toll in the double digits. The interaction here between Cusack and Jackson is terrific.<br/><br/>Nobody can last there for more than an hour. What happens next is a twisted ride of evil. Things just start happening and you begin to wonder, is this real or not? Cusack is the show. He does deliver a great one man show performance.<br/><br/>1408 is a truly bizarre movie. I cannot say whether I really like this or not. It does grab your attention. However, I cannot tell what was going on half the time. The ending though I thought was the best way to end this.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Check in if you like. 1408 is a creepy stay, and for a King adaptation, this was fine.

","56 deaths have plagued an allegedly evil room on the 14th floor of an older hotel in New York City; writer John Cusack, once an author of fiction but now a specialist in books that debunk supernatural phenomena, is warned by the hotel manager not to check in--first and foremost because he doesn't want to clean up the mess. Well-mounted and made horror freak out, adapted from Stephen King's short story by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, is literate, polished and solidly enacted by Cusack as the skeptical (and atheist!) room guest. Director Mikael Håfström, despite suffering a case of ""Shining""-itis, cannily mixes in sly humor with the shocks, as well as detailed minutiae which viewers might not catch on a first viewing. It should play well with aficionados of the genre, though others may find the ensuing violence assaultive (it bludgeons the audience).

","While I liked the acting and the quality of effects, the story felt like a hodgepodge of many other established haunting films. It was pretty typically for a Stephen King scifi/fright film except for the ability to like any of the characters. I'm glad to see King appears, from his last few films, to have gotten over donkey punching our sense of empathy; he seems to tend to make you like a character then reveal the disgusting facts that show how ""human"" that character is. Also new to a King film is the more subtle use of the Deus Ex Machina, if any! I don't recall if there was or wasn't a psychic in this one - which is a good thing! Back to this film - wait for video. Not enough frights to be a good ""Scary film"", nor enough effects to awe, nor a decent enough story to give us something to talk about afterwards. At least the only thing the date I was on and myself could talk about was our mild disappointment - MILD (wait for DVD).<br/><br/>Kudos for Cusack, but I still don't forgive him for Gross Point Blank (yuck)."

","This is the best scary movie I have ever seen. The simplicity of the premise helps it avoid any of the traps other movies fall into when they try to explain the supernatural events. Samuel L. Jackson has a line that sums the beauty of this movie quite well. It's something like: ""I didn't say anything about phantoms... It's an evil f*cking room."" That's it. That's the premise. A guy who doesn't believe in spooks, to use the Tin Man's phrase, goes into this evil f*cking room, and the evil f*cking room messes with his head. There isn't a reliance on gore or phobias - this movie is universally scary.<br/><br/>John Cusak is phenomenal. He makes you forget that it's supposed to be boring to watch one guy in one room for a full hour. Every second of the deterioration of his sanity is captivating.<br/><br/>As the movie approached the finish, I thought about all the possible endings that would ruin the movie. It toyed with each one of them before settling on the ultimately satisfying conclusion, perhaps poking fun at the trite endings of so many other promising horror flicks. This movie came out of nowhere and amazed me."

After a while, however, the same kind of stupid horror kept happening over and over, and I started laughing more and more. This is an awful movie overall, and even as a horror movie, it didn't manage to scare me at all. The story is cheap and almost mundane, full of overused tricks. It's better than vampire movies, but only slightly so. The only mildly original part is when the protagonist thinks he escapes the room, but actually hasn't.

The movie lacked suspense, every turn was predictable, and despite a valiant acting effort from Cusack and an interesting teaser presented by Jackson, 1408 just wasn't up to par. Perhaps it was because Cusack's brooding character seemed typical and overdone.

","As my friend and I stared at the credits for Mikael Hafstrom's ""1408"", we both looked at each other and said: ""What just happened?"" ""1408"" has got to be the only movie I have seen with no trace of a plot. If you are like me and you like to follow plots and story lines, don't waste your time with this one. John Cusack, who plays a character that recently lost his daughter and split from his wife, finds himself looking around for any sign of the afterlife as a haunted travel writer. When he finds out about Room 1408 in a Manhattan hotel, a room that has supposedly killed 56 tenants, he can't resist but to go looking for adventure. All of this is fine - a little bit of background for the movie - a weird hotel room - spooky. Yeah, when Cusack gets in the room some weird things happen. Things that made my friend jump and me laugh. It reminded me of ""The Grudge,"" where some creepy things happened, but there was no reason for them. Some people jumped out of the window of the movie. Okay? John Cusack can't get out of the room. Darn? His daughter appears in the room. Why? The room is flooded, frozen, and finally burned. Yeah? Once again, if you are the analytical type and like to try and sort out movies, this one is hopeless. If you like pointless thrillers, you will absolutely love ""1408."" If not, go see ""Ratatouille"" or something."

","I never found myself invested in this movie. They started to lead up to things, but then dropped the ball, repeatedly. A million tiny ""plots"" about tragedies and suicides and the like, but none were ever explored beyond a two second flash. Cusack's acting was mediocre: His character somehow went from a cynical, non-believing ""ghost buster"" to a whimpering, seemingly LSD-tripping idiot in the course of an hour while coming to grips with his daughter's death. And he certainly didn't try too hard to get out of the ""evil room"" beyond pounding on the door and yelling out a window. I found nothing scary about the movie, so I don't think it can be called Horror. There certainly wasn't much Drama. There's no real reconciliation with his wife = not a Romance. Not much left; just a few cgi effects that were more Twilight Zone-ish (from the 70's version, that is) than anything else. About the only redeeming feature I found was Samuel Jackon's acting. All in all: Not much character development, not much in the way of a real plot, writing that went in way too many directions, a weak main character... don't bother."
"Coventry","4","2","3","14 February 2016"," What do you want from me, evil mini-bar!?!
","I damn well realize that this isn't my most popular personal opinion, but yours truly always thought that Stephen King is incredibly overrated and often even balancing on the edge of being a plagiarist. The fact that so many of his novels/stories got turned into fantastic classic movies – horror or otherwise – is mainly the accomplishment of all the gifted directors that helmed the adaptations (Brian DePalma, Stanley Kubrick, Frank Darabont, Rob Reiner) rather than of King's own writing talents. This ""1408"" is based on a short story of his that probably not many people read, and the film oddly enough received positive reviews in the press and on the internet, although most of the praise once again went to the director (Mikael Hafström) and the cast (John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson). Many of my fellow reviewers also label this as one of the best supernatural/ghost stories of the past two decades, but according to me it's just another derivative, predictable and principally dull thriller. Cusack stars as Mike Enslin; a not-so successful (at least, judging by the upswing at his latest signing session) author specializing in debunking myths and folklore tales surrounding haunted mansions/hotels. Enslin is a skeptic drunk and when he receives an anonymous letter daring him to overnight in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York, he doesn't see much of a challenge. Hotel manager Gerald Olin (Sam. L) still attempts to discourage Enslin by reciting a bunch of horrendous events that occurred in room 1408 as well as by stating that the room is just plain evil, but the stubborn writer obviously won't listen. He soon discovers that there is something very wrong with room 1408, but it's not the type of location that is haunted by the restless ghosts of deceased tenants It's more like the type of haunted location that confronts the victims with his/her own inner demons; in case of Mike Enslin the unprocessed death of his daughter and the fact that he cowardly abandoned his wife. So, we have the story of a mentally unstable guy who gets isolated in a freaky hotel Now where have we seen that before? Yes, Stephen King is nowadays even copycatting himself since ""1408"" is often similar to ""The Shining"". ""1408"" is definitely watchable, and Cusack gives a powerful one-man performance, but the film is too predictable and containing far too many imbecilic sequences, like for example when Mike Enslin is hysterically shouting at the mini-bar."

Aside from it being your very typical Hollywood horror production, I just wasn't able to buy into any of it, from the unconvincing (as usual) supernatural psychological occurrences to the over-the-top yet generic CGI room variations. The film lacks any notion of subtlety and is, in fact, quite excessive with its visual hauntings. It all becomes just so tedious and dull. Don't look to the plot for any help either, as sentimental pap is placed above suspenseful mystery here. On top of all this is John Cusack's ""deer-in-the-headlights"" performance. Looking back, I guess I kinda hated the movie, actually."

"hitchcockthelegend","6","1","1","9 March 2017"," Dolphin Sandwich.
","1408 is based on one of horror writer Stephen King's short stories. It stars John Cusack as a supernatural investigator who rents room 1408 at The Hotel Dolphin in New York. It is said to be a most haunted room and the scene of many deaths. He soon finds his scepticism tested to the max.<br/><br/>Although it has deep themes of grief et al, this essentially boils down to one man in a room being plagued by psychological and physical attacks, with the intended chills and shocks surreal in presentation. It's all very twisty and big on conundrums, which makes a second viewing something of a necessity, whilst Cusack's performance is also reason to check in for another viewing. However, it's not the scary movie some have lauded it as, in fact it's more fun-house palaver than anything terrifying, but there's no doubting the intelligence and skill of the writing. The mind is a curious, wonderful and troubling thing, and 1408 wants us to know it. 6/10"

","In 1408, John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, an investigative journalist and author, who stays in and writes about haunted places. He considers himself a seasoned investigator and hardened skeptic, who does not believe in the existence of the paranormal.<br/><br/>However, one day, while leafing through fan mail, he comes across an ominous postcard from The Dolphin Hotel. It has a simple message scrawled on the back: ""Do Not Enter 1408.<br/><br/>He considers this a challenge, and immediately uses his publisher's clout to book the room, despite objections from the hotel manager (played by Samuel L Jackson).<br/><br/>Upon his arrival, the manager does whatever he can to convince Enslin not to stay in the room: he tells him how 56 deaths have occurred within it's walls- with 22 being qualified as natural deaths that went unreported in papers. While others- none of whom have managed to make it longer than an hour- have either gone insane or engaged in self mutilation. Most, however, simply commit suicide.<br/><br/>Blinded by pride and ego, he decides to ignore these foreboding warnings, and stay in the room anyways. But he could not fathom what it would have in store for him...<br/><br/>And what follows is an anxiety driven, (Vincenzo) Natali-esque, attempt to escape from his Kafkan nightmare- that blurs the boundaries between what is literal and psychological.<br/><br/>Content matter aside, I found this film to be pretty basic and straightforward. A sort of Hollywood brand of psychological horror, if you will- not too complex or challenging. Håfström does throw an awkward twist in there, but it only seemed to draw the film out for another half an hour or so- without changing the direction I felt it was heading in anyways. That being said, the film's most redeeming quality is probably the special effects, utilized to portray the paranormal aspect of the room. But, overall, I left feeling that it was lacking in the depth and context departments.<br/><br/>As far as psychological horrors go...this one is pretty ""meh"".

Then the last scene, he is sitting at a table or desk, he has the recorder and plays it. His wife is holding a box. They both hear their daughters voice on the recorder. His wife drops the box. And then it shows him again. That ending was great and can never be duplicated. For that ending I would give this movie 20 instead of a 10 rating. But, I had purchased this from iTunes recently and saw a totally different ending. Where he dies and there is a funeral. And the hotel manager comes to the cemetery and tries to give his wife a box of his stuff. She refuses. He then gets in his car, sees a burned Mike Enslin in the back seat.

Not only was I not scared in any fashion, I found myself laughing at various points.<br/><br/>Whatever it is that our protagonist is up against is never explained, referenced to or even mentioned, but to have the knowledge of every aspect of Enslin's life suggests god, because who else could know all these things? Very sloppy and unable to suspend disbelief. It seemed more like an action film than a horror flick. Could do with a huge injection of suspense."

","I wouldn't class this movie as ""horror""; it's a psychological thriller / ghost story -- and as such, it's unsurpassed by my standards.<br/><br/>A very original story. Mike Enslin's character is well-developed, but I would've liked to know more about the GM of the hotel, as well as the room itself (instead of seeing so much of that dead little girl; I wasn't interested in her at all, but I see why she was necessary).<br/><br/>Instead of just shutting the room down, they should've conducted scientific research in it. In this day and age, people don't ignore things like that -- this was kind of unrealistic, but the rest of the movie was pretty believable and effective.<br/><br/>John Cusack is a very talented actor, and ""1408"" has to be his best movie.<br/><br/>I have seen it a number of times and never get tired of it.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

","""1408"" is absolutely the creepiest psychological thriller ever made. The cast and direction and effects are excellent. Anyone who has experienced reliving a realistic nightmare (in their sleep) or the real-life trauma of any deep emotional loss can relate to Jon Cusack's tortured character in the film and will suffer right along with him! We've never seen a film where we were so tense and caught up in the storyline, suffering with the main character as if it was real life we were watching! We have recommended this movie to many people and suggest they watch it without interruption for the full powerful impact and effect that the film's story and atmosphere provides. Jon Cusack is an amazing actor. Not many actors can star so successfully in such a wide variety of enjoyable films - a psychological thriller like ""1408"" and a fun romantic comedy like ""Serendipity"" and an excellent dramatic portrayal of Edgar Allen Poe in ""The Raven."" We heartily recommend ""1408"" to anyone who loves psychological thrillers! P.S. The end of the movie is beyond amazing - quite chilling!"
"ebiros2","3","1","1","3 September 2011"," More of physical terror than spiritual terror
","It was interesting to see how horror would be depicted in a hotel room. It turned into physical violence by the ghosts that would have been terrorizing even if they were not done by any super natural entities. This turned away from pure ghost based terror like ""Juon"". Asians might have the market in this genre. I think they understand true spiritual terror better than the Hollywood movie makers.<br/><br/>The acting was good, and although there was only two real actors in this movie, John Cusack and Samuel Jackson, they built enough tension to make the whole story work. The first 30 minutes of the movie was superb mostly due to the acting abilities of these two actors.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie, you have to see it for yourself. Whether you like it or not will probably depend on where you're coming from. Unexpected turn of events were well placed, and as a movie this was an entertaining piece."

It's conveying the spirit of the ""the shining"" novel, featuring the ROOM being the evil 'thing' and driving people insane while repeatedly breaking the barrier to the physical world (thus making all of it being a psychosis impossible)...<br/><br/>All in all, a very good Kafkaesque movie with an awesome ending.

","Although I expected more of a supernatural movie, I found it more to be one man's journey through an alcohol fuelled delusion. John Cusack was great in basically a one man show. I didn't find it all that frightening. Maybe a little creepy at times, there were some good visuals that were a little unsettling, but overall it didn't give me that psychological chill that other movies have. I think maybe a different director other than Mikael Håfström may have created a different and more macabre take on the story. I honestly think this movie had a lot of potential to scare. However I didn't feel that this movie pulled it off. In a movie of this nature I want to feel a little psychological terror, or confusion in myself, not just in watching the main character fall to pieces. ""Show me the bone chilling terror, and the rivers of blood....it's just a room"" I couldn't have put it any better. In saying that...it was an enjoyable movie to watch, if you don't expect too much from it."
"wildsidecinema","Null","1","1","12 June 2010"," King Continues to Score Big
","1408 is one of the best damn Stephen King films I've seen in years and that's saying something considering there's been quite a few! If ever a body of work demanded remakes all across the board, King's adaptations would be at the top of that list! It was just incredibly refreshing to be able to sit down and watch a competent, mature horror film directed by a highly capable director like Mikael (Derailed) Håfström as well as starring a talented, and likable, actor like John Cusack. I'd be lying if I said there wasn't a small part of me that yearned to hear a New England accent or see King himself in a goofy little cameo but that's just my love for cheese rearing its tacky head as it so often does. Despite the film's PG-13 rating, it takes itself dead serious and never once caters to the teeny bopper crowd by dragging out clichéd scare tactics or torturous ""pop chic"" dialog.<br/><br/>Truthfully, this movie probably could have worked just as well with some other actor but John Cusack was perfect for the role of Mike Enslin. He did a wonderful job of portraying a damaged husband and grieving father, one could hardly fault the guy for wanting to prove to the world there's no fairytale afterlife awaiting usno promise of Heavenno God to protect us. I wouldn't say Cusack has an incredible range when it comes to acting; he seems to be the same character in every film he's in (like Christopher Walken). Nevertheless he pulled it off and that's all that counts.<br/><br/>If you're a King fan, this will definitely impress you. If you're a Cusack fan, I'd say this film makes up for Serendipity. If you're just looking for some original horror that doesn't rely on gore, sex or CG than you've definitely gotta give this film a shot! Solid flick indeed."
"glgioia","6","1","1","12 January 2009"," Rod Serling with a bludgeon
","John Cusack plays noted travel author Mike Enslin who earns his bread and cheese by visiting haunted places and then writing them up as the ubiquitous Top Ten Haunted .... We quickly observe however, that Enslin is somewhat of a fraud. He harbors cynicism and even though he sells these books to the public, he's more interested in feeding his own personal demon; to debunk the whole notion of a haunted anything. He's driven or haunted if you will by a quest to prove if only to himself that haunted houses and spirituality, and even religion, is all a lot of nonsense. <br/><br/>When he receives an anonymous post card inviting him to spend a night in a haunted NYC hotel room, room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel to be exact, Enslin of course meets his match. <br/><br/>From the opening frames, ""1408"" constructs an effective anticipatory pace- roller coaster style, and thats obviously vital in a scary film. I especially enjoyed the conversation between Cusack and the forever and needlessly angry Samuel L. Jackson. He's still that of course, but good direction here has him properly harnessed and enjoyable for a change as he does an excellent job as the obligatory ""don't go in there"" hotel manager. Of note to Jackson fans, in spite of the movie poster, Jackson is a supporting character at best and on film for all of 7 minutes, maybe 8.<br/><br/>From the effective buildup we enter at last, the haunted hotel room and the fun begins, and there the fun soon ends. Indeed the remainder of the film has us locked in the evil room with Cusack. We start slowly with some truly creepy and memorable images before eventually and all too inevitably, the full Hollywood special effects ghost treatment, floods, fire, ice, make their dreaded appearances. Some frights are really effective and for me the 15-20 minutes where the scary stuff happens sorta makes the entire film OK. But that all happens and the horror peaks and passes way too quickly. Before it ever gets really terrifying, our roller-coaster is making the slow boring return to the platform via the maudlin sub story line. <br/><br/>I say again however, this is a good movie - using the grading scale sadly needed in the year 2009. Its good. But in keeping pace with all modern films ""1408"" has way too much cowbell and the special effects orgy eventually becomes boring, no matter how much you like this sorta stuff. I liken film viewing these days to hanging onto a greased pole. I'd say it took a good hour into this before I lost interest and slid off into the kitchen for some Oreos. <br/><br/>Yet my biggest criticism, really my only substantive criticism is that ""1408"" apart from actually being watchable to the finish, fails to distinguish itself as a horror film. It breaks no new ground whatsoever, whether in terms of fright excitement, plot twist or even human drama. There's tons of unanswered questions, but not the provocative kind, more the kind that lead you to believe a lot of this wasn't well thought out. But I'll leave that up to you."

","Although the movie takes up the tired ""haunted house"" plot/theme, strong acting and a clever script manage to keep the movie interesting.<br/><br/>The movie is about a popular author who writes books on haunted hotels. Contrary to what he writes, he's actually a skeptic and thinks everything's a con. Following up on a simplistic message on a postcard, he resolves stay in a particular room at a hotel. He thinks he's being conned by the hotel staff when things start to get strange ... but begins think twice.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of the movie is that there is a fairly intelligent character who's a skeptic. It is well-played by John Cusack who is constantly trying to dismiss everyone's warnings and all the strange things that occur.<br/><br/>On the minus side, the movie seemed a bit long because a haunted house plot with only 1 main character can only go so far. As movie-goers, we've seen it all. The script is clever, but this genre is a hard wall to climb.<br/><br/>If you like Stephan King stories or supernatural movies, this is definitely worth watching; for everyone else, consider it an above-average movie choice."

","John Cusack is the author of cheesy books about haunted places. The movie begins showing him at a local lodge where he spends the night in a supposedly haunted room which turns out to be perfectly normal. He heads back to L.A. and goes surfing where he gets knocked down by a wave and banged on the head with his surfboard. Next he's at a diner reading his mail and sees a postcard that says ""Don't enter 1408."" The card is from the Dolphin Hotel in New York. Intrigued, Cusack talks his manager into booking him into the room. (Add up 1408 = 13) <br/><br/>At the Dolphin Hotel, Samuel L Jackson plays the manager. He does not want Cusack to stay in 1408 but after a long scene of haggling, he agrees. Cusack checks into the room. From this point on in the film all sorts of strange things start to happen. It's Cusack alone in the room, basically for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Frankly, the previews of this film make it seem much better than it actually is. After all the bizarre things that happen there is really no payoff or explanation. The only way to explain the film is that it must be a nightmare or hallucination. There is no logical explanation. I like Cusack but he really didn't need to be in this film. Neither did Samuel L. Jackson.<br/><br/>Another missed adaptation of a Stephen King short story."
"evanston_dad","6","1","1","23 October 2007"," Now THAT's One Haunted Hotel
","This competent but ultimately overblown chiller stars John Cusack as an arrogant author who writes books about haunted hotels even though he doesn't believe in spooks. All of that changes when he spends a night in room 1408 in some upscale New York hotel and is confronted with the ghosts (literal and figurative) of a life he's tried hard to forget.<br/><br/>Like much of Stephen King's stories, this one starts out effective and creepy, but it doesn't know when to quit, and the supernatural overwhelms the suspense. The scenes building up to the moment when Cusack actually enters the room are quite unnerving, especially a scene in which Cusack's character talks to the hotel manager (Samuel L. Jackson), who shares the hotel's history with him and begs him not to spend the night in that room. And even the first inklings of something amiss once he's in the room and his vigil has begun are creepy, precisely because of their banality: pictures that tilt on their own, a radio that won't stop playing a Carpenters song. But as the night progresses, the director and screenwriter feel obligated to pile one horror on top of the next, each more outrageous than the one before, so that the film devolves into nothing more than a marvel of effects and production design.<br/><br/>John Cusack deserves a lot of credit, though, for his performance. He's in the movie virtually by himself, and most of the time has nothing but a set to interact with. It's a performance that really belongs in a better film.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","""Hotel from hell,"" ""roach motel,"" ""flea bag"" and on and on to describe an accommodation that didn't meet our minimum requirements for a good night's sleep. Mikael Hafstrom's 1408 fits all descriptors and some movies as well such as Psycho, Hostel, Vacancy, and Bug. The titular number refers to the room no one is allowed to use at NYC's Dolphin Hotel (perhaps based on an infamous room at San Diego's Hotel del Coronado). As the manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), warns, ""It's an f'n evil room."" <br/><br/>It's Stephen King territory all right: Famous debunking-ghost-stories writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack, having inn problems as he did in Identity) visits the room, after hammering the management to let him in, to write about it as another in a line of fictional horror homes. As with The Shining, disbelievers should become believers, in this case within an hourno one has ever lasted more, including the over 50 deaths since the early 20th century.<br/><br/>But clichéd horrors like bleeding walls and uncontrollable hot water faucets are just part of the complex world of this genre. Enslin's loss of a daughter preys on his memory and becomes real in the miasma of the chamber, where what's real and imagined are never clearly defined, resting on the genre staple of the mad mind mirroring the mad hell outside. In effect the story certifies ghosts if you minimally accept the presence of departed loved ones in our minds.<br/><br/>After a haunting exposition with some deafening silence and a spirited argument between Enslin and Olin worth seeing, the plot devolves into clichés about madness made visible through genre staples. The twists at the end aren't up to the similarly eerie Sixth Sense, but Cusack and Jackson are worth watching.<br/><br/>Like the 13th floor, room 1408 should be the one to avoid if you have a choice. The movie 1408 is not as scary as you hoped, but it sure is a mess. So much for maid service."

The room is on a floor of a dignified hotel with many other rooms on the same floor...are we supposed to think the occupants of other rooms don't notice the screams or the loud noises? No effect on the rooms on the other sides of the walls of Room 1408? No people gathering in the hallway wondering what is happening? Why does Enslin's daughter appear in the room when she was never an occupant? A group of wreckers comes to the room and demolishes it...what was that all about? Worst of all, the room is not developed as an evil character, as was done in the Shining...it is just special effects.

As a sucker for composition, I have to gush about the cinematography of the film as almost every shot and bit of camera work succeeded to build up tormenting suspense and famous ""oh crap"" moments. One of the things that helped in making this movie so damn scary was the character of Mike Enslin and his role in the film. We see that he is completely skeptical of the paranormal yet we also get an in depth glimpse into his curiosity for the afterlife. He isn't just a character who is unexpecting and reacts in horror to everything; We expect to see something because he is always waiting for something strange, and we become skeptical through his humor... which eventually leads us, the audience, into a position of vulnerability. This is a story that uses every part of the buffalo and looks beyond the cheap thrills and scary monsters and examines every opportunity to share a character's dimensions and bring it to life in the form of terror, and also utilizes other events we deem at first as insignificant in order to amplify the absolute sense of dread and inner turmoil.<br/><br/>The trailer was TERRIBLY misleading."

","Who is expecting blood or a conventional horror movie will be a lot disappointed. 1408 is more than just a horror movie, it's a psychological mix of horror and thriller in the best brilliant way possible like old classic horror movies used to be.<br/><br/>As well said, 1408 is a story that Stephen King never published as a book. The writers not just did a movie based on a limited material as they put all together in the story most of the elements that Stephen King's stories classically have.<br/><br/>The movie is a nightmare coz its confusing, claustrophobic and frightening in real time. But the most horrifying thing of it it's not its story, but yes all the situations lived by John Cusack which starts being a lot terrifying when we start imagine our selves living all his experiences. By the way, John Cusack is brilliant as always. The path he goes thru his sanity to insanity in 60 minutes makes Mike Enslin one of the best performances of his career.<br/><br/>The writers seems to be a bunch of people that know a lot about Stephen King's stories because references of his works are in every corner of the room: Cujo, The Shinning, Pat Cemetery, Rose Madder, Misery, and a lot more. 1408 is also a lot similar to Silent Hill: The Room, a video game for PS2.<br/><br/>Mikael Håfström, the same director of Derailed (2005) did an amazing job. Even both movies setting their main stories in hotel rooms, who watched Derailed would never imagine that he would be the director of such a movie like 1408.<br/><br/>Like Identity (2003), another hotel movie also starring John Cusack, 1408 is not just a horror movie, it's something that you will watch and you probably will not like it for the first time, but you'll be impressed, thinking about it for hours and trying to understand what really happened."

The story is quite confuse and the end seems as if the authors did not really know how to finish the plot. The screenplay is based on a short story by Stephen King and has not got the power for a 90 minute movie. Nearly everything was seen before. Samuel L.

"MoreSnakesPlease","5","3","6","29 August 2007"," Horror is one thing 1408 lacks
","1408 lacks actual suspense and horror, but plenty of cheap thrills for those who aren't familiar with the genre. This is a definite rental, not the least bit scary or even thrilling. The King short story was excellent simply because it was a creative idea that was SHORT (keyword) and not an entire novel. It provided a simple ""guy goes nuts"" plot line with crazy happenings that made a quick page turner. Stretching that neat idea into a full length feature film just does not work especially if you're read the short story. I also thought there were too many cheap scares which seemed desperate and unintentionally funny such as the creepy skeletal zombie thing in the ventilation system which conveniently pops out as Cusack nears... (cheap, and not frightening unless you are nine and haven't seen a single, generic horror film) Samuel L. Jackson delivers a fantastic and entertaining performance, then I begin to realize how little of him there is on this film. Does his role merit a name and picture on the cover of the poster? As a fan of his I say yes, but really? No. John Cusack was also amazing as usual and did a lot with the story he was given, playing the character very closely to the short story. If you like watching these actors I would definitely see this movie, just don't expect to be scared in the least. The additional plot lines not found in the short story which arrive as it nears the first hour point, were intriguing and some nice touches like the song ""Only Just Begun"" this was clever.<br/><br/>This isn't entirely a bad movie, but it is a bad horror movie. The highlights are the actors, not much else. It fails as a horror movie by a) not provoking fear or creating tension b) lacking suspense if there ever is any, it must immediately call for a burst of sound to make people jump (which does NOT scare in the least) c) recycled plot lines (especially in the last two thirds of the film) Some of these poorly written plot lines seem made for TV especially when they are delivered in a format seen before. In particular, the daughter's death which includes the predictable return of her body. The presentation of this segment is mediocre.<br/><br/>Paying 10 bucks for a movie isn't a problem for me, but it can become one when the movies continue to disappoint and I begin to think of a different movie I could have seen instead more deserving of that money/time. Did you read the short story yourself? If not, do so, 1408 (the novel) was a nice little 1 hour read with a simple plot and interesting POV, the movie turned and stretched it out adding the silly mother/daughter subplot I've certainly seen before. Sure that brought Cusack some nice acting moments (I can't say enough how was great he is in 1408) but that portion of the story was ultimately pointless and disappointing. Samuel L. Jackson also had some fine moments BUT he is in this for about 8 minutes! Acting aside, the horrors of this summer are disappointing in fact; I'm looking to Hairspray to be the scariest movie of the summer."

That's not for Håfström, though: he splits his WTF moments up and spreads them around the movie. The segue back to the beach made the whole goddamned theater groan. What pains me about this is that I wanted to like this movie, and I can't really hate it, not with Cusack's performance, the solid concept and the well-used effects.

"crowdish","8","3","7","28 June 2007"," Beautiful visually; gorgeously creepy
","When I first saw a preview for 1408 several months ago, I was just confused. John Cusack in a horror film? I turned to my boyfriend in the theater and asked if he had just seen the same trailer I had. I supposed he and Stephen King knew each other after their work together on Stand By Me in 1986, but still. This was an entirely different thing. This was a completely new direction for the man known to so many as Lloyd Dobler. It was so interesting that I just had to see it for myself.<br/><br/>The movie was based on a short story of the same name, published in 2002 among thirteen other tales in the anthology Everything's Eventual. Though I hadn't read it, Stephen King movies always make me a little nervous. Obviously, there have been several gems, such as Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and Brian De Palma's Carrie, but more often than not, it feels like King's stories are more effective on paper than they are on the big screen. 1408 is one of the exceptions. Beautiful visually, it made me wonder how it ever sufficed as only words.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting in that far-fetched way that King has so brilliantly mastered over the years. Mike Enslin, an occult writer who doesn't really believe in ghosts, stays in hotel rooms for a living and rates them on their creepiness. You guess what comes next. Of course he ends up face to face with the real thing, finding himself over his head in a paranormal world he never believed existed. The interesting thing is what he actually finds himself up against. Rather than ghosts or ghouls, the antagonist in Mike Enslin's story is actually the room itself. From the very beginning, room 1408 seems to be a sentient being; a personification of evil. John Cusack excels a difficult task; that is, acting opposite to an inanimate object. He is alone in the hotel room for large portions of the movie but still manages to react in honest, believable ways, despite the difficulties of being alone in front of a camera.<br/><br/>Don't forget, 1408 is a scary movie and it's effective at what it does. The cinematography is gorgeously creepy throughout. Despite a few cheesy shots, the special effects are an overall enhancement and don't make it feel less real, like much of the CGI in Hollywood nowadays. Though subtle, sound is an important part of the film's atmosphere, and the suspense created by Gabriel Yared's musical score is only equaled by a few stretches of very well placed silence. Over the years, the ""thirteenth floor"" sector of the superstition genre has almost become a species of its own. (Remember, thought 1408 may be the number of a fourteenth floor room, hotels skip the thirteenth floor when they number!) This is a psychological thriller through and through. As Mike Enslin tries to sort out reality from illusions, the audience is left sifting through the leftovers and trying to decide for themselves.<br/><br/>Be ready for a roller coaster of twists, turns and false endings, some predictable and some surprising. Expect a few horror movie clichés but also look forward to a few genuinely interesting oddities. John Cusack has tried something new but Stephen King is up to his old tricks. This is not another gore-filled serial killer story in the style of Texas Chainsaw Massacre; 1408 is the twisted story of evil, insanity and the strength of the human will to live."

","WOW! Man i thought this was gonna one of those crappy horror movies like The Bogeyman. but this actually left me shaking and made me not John Cusack trapped in a place you cannot escape. Like most Horror movies the main character doesn't die at the end but has proof of what he or she went through (believe me go to any movie rental store and buy a movie that has something super natural about it and it most likely have the thing i said above)The camera angles and effects where shot perfectly (like when he was looking down to the street and it kinda makes it seem longer then what it actually is.) The acting was a little bit on the soft side but it still was better than a lot of movies, seeing John Cusack turn crazy and freaked out was so cool, and seeing that kinda makes you feel like your in 1408. The cinematography was amazing. And the most weirdest comment through this whole review: They did a good job hiding the cameras. Don't know what i mean well I'm about to tell you. There where a lot of mirriors in the room and the cameras where pointed right at them and they are not in the reflection. Im not sure how the hell do they do that but it is really cool. The scare factor in this movie was unlike any PG 13 movies. In fact it will maybe wet a little 7th graders pants. But what i look for in horror movies is the amount and joltiest of pop out parts.( parts that just pop out at you from nowhere.) But what makes me mad is the comericals. They show the best damn parts. Like that guy with the hammer and the person that slit there throat and is in the vents. ARRRGGGGGGGHHHH! Its just so annoying. Well the overall rating is a 9 out of 10."
"freaky_dave","7","3","7","24 June 2007"," Not bad, but I was expecting more
","1408, based on a short story by Stephen King, has a lot of creeps and chills, but I found myself wishing for more. The film offers some nifty spooks, and is more of a cerebral horror film than anything, but it still felt lacking.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays Mike Enslin. He is a writer of ghost stories, but since his daughter has died, he has lost faith and believes that there are no real haunted places to write about. He goes all over the country to stay in haunted rooms to prove that spooky places and ghosts do not exist. One day someone sends him a postcard about the Dolphin Motel in New York and tells him not to go in to room 1408. Seeing a chance to prove another haunt false, he decides to go to the Dolphin Motel and stay in 1408.<br/><br/>Once at the hotel, he is accosted by the hotel manager named Gerald Olin, played by Samuel Jackson, who pleads with him not to go into that room. Gerald Olin explains about the deaths that have occurred in there, but Mike Enslin is insistent, and so Gerald Olin reluctantly gives him the key to the room.<br/><br/>Once inside the room a few moments pass and Mike is ready to call this another fake haunting, but then a The Carpenters ""We've Only Just Begun"" comes blasting out of the radio which he had not turned on, and then strange things start to happen as the clock radio is suddenly counting down the hour. I will say no more about the plot.<br/><br/>Mikhael Hafstrum, the director, offers up some genuine chills, and the scenes in the room will feel like a weird mind warp, but I was still expecting him to go farther with the film's clever ideas. He never does, and then the film is over.<br/><br/>The acting was well done. John Cusack as usual is good, and Samuel Jackson wasn't bad either. In fact, Cusack's performance helps raise the film to a higher level, and that is one of the biggest reasons why I find myself recommending it even though it needed some more pizazz."

You feel trapped at times in the room, and are left imagine what would you do to get out. The music was very scary so that helps to send the chills down your spine.

","I see horror movies on TV, I see them in theaters or on DVD and they're usually okay, but not scary...maybe a creepy moment or two. But ""1408"" actually freaked the crap out of me. Really, it could have been scarier but this one actually got me tense and at the edge of my seat with my heart racing. So that surprised me. Good for them. I think the moment that just got me the most was when he was looking out the window and he saw someone that looked like him and did everything he did, and the guy with the hammer comes behind him and is swinging it at him. The entire theater was screaming as if someone had brought a gun in there and shot somebody. It was intense and really got me. I think that if he was in the hotel and he was just locked in, that would've been pretty boring. What really grabs you is that he's locked in and there is no possible way out. Everything changes, it's like he's not even in a real world anymore. For example: Him screaming and no noise was made, him on the side of the building trying to crawl to a new window and all the windows were gone, the ""ways out"" just didn't work anymore. Stuff like that. Also it grabs you with the whole thing ""is it real? Is this real? Is he imagining it?"". The ending kinda confused me though...maybe that was the point.<br/><br/>I recommend this to any horror fan.<br/><br/>My Score: 8/10"

","I just wanted to say that I am a true Stephen King fan and love most if not all of his works. Bound in paper, but not limited to the imagination, Everythings Eventual containing 1408, was a haunting thriller that I absolutely loved. When I found out that it was going to be brought to the big screen I was excited and also worried. Excited because when I read that short story, it chilled me to the bone, and being able to see it visually on screen I knew it was going to halt my breath. I hoped it would bring the Stephen King essence which is within all his tales, from vampires to men with an addiction.<br/><br/>(When I am introducing one of King's works to one of my friends or family, even sometimes people I don't know, I always tell them...""Grasp the key, unlock the door, and open a world of pure horror."" It might be lame, but once they read one of his books, they know what I mean.) The only thing that I was worried about was; Was it going to be true to the story? It was, for the most part. I enjoyed every bit of it, from beginning to end. I felt the horror, the trauma, I even felt the deep breaths and harsh exhaling of John Cusacks character, Mike Enslin.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job,(kudos Mr. Cusack). Samuel L. Jackson also brought the works, and I feel he fell right into the part of Gerald Olin.<br/><br/>1408 was frightening, and also had some humor. Everything to the tea, of genuine Stephen king....give or take a few swaps of detail here and there. Sorry for rambling, I just really like King, and I really loved the movie 1408"

","""I am not going in that room."" And as well you shouldn't, one crazy little room indeed. Well, Stephen King sure knows how to creep people out with his stories, even though this is only based on a short story by King, its still very well elaborated and plays out very well as a movie. This movie was extremely psychological and 100% haunted house type of scary. 1408 definitely has its twists and turns, and definitely questions the paranormal. I found myself waiting and wondering what other creepy element will scare the hell out of me or definitely freak the hell out of me and Mike Enslin (John Cusack). This film was incredibly intense, well, psychologically intense anyway. I was disappointed to see Samuel L. Jackson having only a minor role, although he's an important character, he's only in the film for about 20min; 20 very important and creepy minutes. In my opinion, this film was pretty stunning, it just wasn't you're average and ordinary slasher(well, not exactly slasher)/horror/psychological movie, it was even more than that, it broke through those boundaries and created something imaginative and something worth watching. Sure, things that happen in this film are still questionable, but hey, it's a room from hell, so it can do what ever it wants. Music is good, definitely pumps up the creep factor to 10. Acting is also really good, John Cusack did a great job, it really feels like this character is going mad and you feel like joining him in the process. There's only so much you can do inside a room, and there's only to much that can happen in room 1408."

","I think you are mistaken... The ending was not him being trapped in the room forever; it was just showing that rather than it being a figment of his imagination, the events really happened. Throughout the movie there was a constant inner battle of whether he was insane or whether the things in the room were actually happening. The ending would have been a little more convincing than it was if they were trying to get the viewer to think he was trapped in the room forever. That's also why his wife reacted the way she did and he just kind of smirked because he was proved right by the tape.<br/><br/>Great movie though I definitely recommend it.

"blowoutthecandles","10","2","4","4 June 2017"," A relatively modern version of the classic ""The Shining""
","It's not the same plot of course, but haunted hotels nonetheless, both based on books by the same author. <br/><br/>I think there's a bit of Stephen King in Mike Enslin, played by John Cusack who in my opinion is an underrated actor because he truly delivers in this film (and others, but he is often given roles in crappy films).<br/><br/>A cynical, drunkard writer frequents haunted places even though he doesn't believe in ghosts, but a part of him hopes to finally witness ghost activities in order to provide his readers authentic horror stories. He finally gets to experience it, but it's nothing like he'd imagined. The ordeal is eye-opening to him in two aspects: supernatural entities do exist (in the movie at least) and his own life. The true horror is mostly psychological, as this entity makes him relive the worst moments of his life: his daughter passing away from cancer, him leaving his wife afterwards and moving away to distance himself from anything that relates to the tragic event and his complex relationship with his father. He's filled with regret over a lot of life decisions and that is what breaks him, and also what compels him to survive and win the battle against the room. There are two alternative endings to this film, one where he lives and the other where he dies (obviously), but the one where he survives is superior because it would make sense after all his efforts to become a better person. I shamelessly admit that I love Samuel L Jackson regardless of the character he's portraying, and he was definitely a nice addition to the movie. The film is also not the typical jump scares cheesy thriller, and in that it stands out from the average thriller movies nowadays. I watched it too many times to count, definitely recommend this!"
"aramis-112-804880","6","2","4","23 September 2013"," The Banality of Spooks
","Definite spoilers.<br/><br/>""1408"" starts off extremely well. For about an hour into the story, it is about as creepy as first-class horror can get; then it turns into a John Cusack tour-de-force and little else.<br/><br/>A chubby-looking John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer reduced to authoring books debunking paranormal phenomena. He lives a continent away from his wife (Mary McCormack)plumping for California while she is holed up in NYC.<br/><br/>Though he tries to avoid the whole city of New York because his former wife lives there, Enslin finds the story of a haunted hotel room in the Big Apple too juicy to pass up.<br/><br/>The hotel management (with a bit-parting Samuel L. Jackson at the top of the food chain) tries to talk Enslin out of taking the room. Like all idiot lead characters who make horror books and movies possible, Enslin demands his rights to the unoccupied room. The management reluctantly relents.<br/><br/>At this point, ""1408"" is A-list horror. The rule of thumb for the best horror, whether written or on film, is that the unseen is always scarier. The walk Enslin takes to his room is indeed creepy. His first fifteen or twenty minutes on his own rank among the most effective horror on film.<br/><br/>From the time Enslin closes the door to his room, Cusack is practically a one-man show. By turns he freezes, he burns; he examines his situation rationally, he has the screaming meemies.<br/><br/>Early on, the famous ""banality of evil"" line from Hannah Arendt is mentioned. By the middle of the movie, ""1408"" begins to prove it as the movie frays at its seams.<br/><br/>This is not to say it doesn't have lots of clever ideas. It also has some of those really spooky ""Ahhh! There's a bald guy with a claw hammer!"" moments as well as its ""I feel my skin creeping"" moments. It also has very funny moments, too, as when the evil of room 1408 calls up with the voice of helpful room service.<br/><br/>The ""skin creeping"" moments are better, but after the first hour the movie gives way to showing just one awful thing after another until it ceases to become either creepy or spooky but simply on-going. It truly illustrates the banality of evil by itself becoming banal. <br/><br/>During the first half of the time Enslin spends in 1408 you're on the edge of your seat, desperate to find out whether he's going to live. During the second half, you're glancing repeatedly at your watch, thinking that if he's going to die he'd better do it before you do. <br/><br/>Some of the depicted spooky stuff does work, as when Enslin waves to the guy in the apartment across the street. But when the spooks appear fast and furiously they have to ratchet the music up a notch to make sure you know to be frightened. At your house you can always scare someone in a dark room by tip-toeing up behind them and yelling ""Boo!"" That's the level this movie sinks to.<br/><br/>The best thing about ""1408"" is that it focuses in on what traditional supernatural evil is supposed to do, i.e., play with one's mind. It doesn't really change the room or make blood or bile ooze from the walls, but it makes you see and hear stuff that isn't there until you do crazy things, like listen to your dog next door and shoot people, or vote Obama. And Cusack has flashbacks to some of the most painful moments of his life, meeting his deceased father; and his deceased daughter, who ranks right up there with the eeriest children in film history: Damien, the girl in ""The Ring"" with the bad hairdo and Jake Lloyd. <br/><br/>So while they nail evil in this movie, they also get too bound up in its banality. It starts out like the best horror movie ever, but its first class effects go on and on and on and on. And on. Though its alleged running time is only 104 minutes, it seems much longer."

"sddavis63","4","2","4","24 April 2008"," A One-Man Performance By John Cusack In A Sub-Par Supernatural Thriller
","The only reason I can think of to go out of your way to see this movie would be if you're a big fan of John Cusack. I've seen him in movies I thought were very good; I've seen him in others I've thought were not so good. ""1408"" falls somewhere in the middle - mediocre/fair - but give credit to John Cusack: in a movie that for large stretches was little more than a one man performance on his part he's very good, and manages to hold the attention of the viewer enough to get through a largely disappointing movie that's neither very original nor particularly frightening.<br/><br/>My first reaction after watching this is that Stephen King must be rapidly running out of story ideas. This movie is about a writer who finds himself in an isolated place, cut off from the world, with supernatural goings on all around and rapidly going crazy because of it. Isn't that the basic plot of ""The Shining?"" Take away the supernatural element and isn't it the basic plot of ""Misery?"" And how many Stephen King stories have to feature writers? (Here, add at least the movie ""Stand By Me"" based on King's story ""The Body"" to the list.) And the real problem is that ""1408"" isn't anywhere near as good as any of those three.<br/><br/>Basically, Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a paranormal investigator and debunker (who is dealing with demons of his own, revolving largely around the death of his young daughter) who is writing a book about his experiences staying in supposedly haunted hotels. He gets a mysterious postcard that tells him to check out Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York. He investigates and discovers that a lot of strange things have happened there and so decides it's a good topic for a chapter of his book. The story goes on from there.<br/><br/>There are several problems with the story, not the least of which is - as I said above - that it's neither very original nor particularly frightening. Arriving at the hotel, Enslin is met by the hotel manager Gerald Olin (played by Samuel L. Jackson.) Olin doesn't want him in Room 1408; he doesn't rent 1408 because of the many deaths that have occurred there over the years - 56 as I recall, some of natural causes, others not so natural. Here's the first plot problem for me. Why 56? That's a lot of deaths for one room. The hotel management would have to have one of two reactions. Either it's nothing more than a bizarre coincidence, in which case why bother refusing to rent the room? It's just a coincidence. Or, they believe (as Olin does) that there's something going on with the room - in which case why wait for 56 deaths to start refusing to rent it? Why not 40? Or 30? Or 10? Why suddenly after #56 say ""wow! Something's really weird with this room! We better not rent it any more!"" In any event, a provision of the civil rights act forces the hotel to rent the room to Enslin. Once in Room 1408, Enslin doesn't strike me as a very good paranormal investigator/debunker. In the first little while that's he's in the room three things happen - the clock radio turns on by itself, a window slams shut on his hand and injures him, and there's an unexpected blast of scalding water from the bathroom sink. Quite a coincidence, but surely a cynical debunker such as Enslin would quickly think of logical explanations for them (I did, and I'm neither cynical nor a paranormal investigator and debunker!) Instead, Enslin is terrified and immediately tries to get out of the room! The movie continues to work through fairly routine ""chills"" - and you start to think it's over at one point with a logical explanation of what happened (without giving too much away, I'll just say I was glad this didn't end with the beach scene as it looked like it might; that would have made a mediocre movie a dreadful one.) There's never any real resolution to the mystery of the room. Near the beginning of the movie, Olin tells Enslin that it's not about ghosts or anything else - the room itself is evil. That's as close as we come to an explanation. And the closing scene served little purpose to me. Was it to show us that Enslin's wife now believed his story? Frankly, I didn't care if she believed him or not. Was it to show us that Enslin was now convinced? I always assumed he was. Was it to convince the viewer that this really happened? Again, I always assumed from the context of the movie that it did. This was altogether disappointing.<br/><br/>A note on Samuel L. Jackson to close. If you're a Jackson fan, don't watch this because he's in it. He played his role well, but the role is very limited, and his presence - to me at least - neither added to the movie nor detracted from it. The producers clearly just wanted a name to go alongside Cusack and they found Jackson, but I or anyone else could have played the part of Olin. (Memo to Hollywood producers: the next time you have a nothing part to fill, I come a lot cheaper than Samuel L. Jackson!) As far as the movie's concerned? On the ""shiver-metre"" (Enslin's rating for the creepiness of the hotels he stays at) - 4/10."
"galensaysyes","2","2","4","8 April 2008"," Noisy rather than scary
","1408 demonstrates in many particulars how not to tell a ghost story.<br/><br/>The story being told, or trying to be told, is this: A skeptical ghost writer (a writer on ghosts, that is not an unattributed author) sets out to spend a night in a haunted room and finds out that it's for real--which is rather the conclusion one expects, since otherwise there would be no story. It's a story told before, and one that would in theory be simple to manage, since it contains only a few essential elements; yet every one of them is mishandled here.<br/><br/>The least of the movie's problems, but the one that becomes obvious soonest, lies with the main character. What is he exactly? A skeptic about ghosts. Which means that he writes skeptical books, yes? Well, no: he writes ghost travel guides with titles like Ten Haunted Lighthouses. So he poses as a believer, and keeps his skepticism to himself? Well, no again: in public appearances, he scoffs openly at ghosts. So he's a hack who affects the tone of a believer? No a third time: when he dictates notes to himself for use in the book, they're in the key of Menckenian cynicism. It wouldn't matter much to the story which way he bent, but we needed to know, so we could proceed from there.<br/><br/>And then there's the room itself. It isn't just any haunted room, it's a room that the hotel pretends doesn't exist, a room that has killed or driven insane all who have dared to sleep in it, the mother of all evil rooms. The movie makes this point for a good half hour before showing us the dread cubicle. Not content with showing us the writer's Internet researches and the maneuvers to which he has to resort to book a reservation, it continues to a lengthy scene with the hotel manager issuing dire warnings to the writer to stay away. In this scene the casting of the manager is crucial because he's the character who sells us the lore--the Van Helsing character--and who sells us the danger--""Wear this for your mother's sake""; the one who _believes_. And whom did the director choose to perform these two invaluable functions? Samuel L. Jackson. Now, Jackson is a good actor, in some circumstances, but he's an actor who when he believes in a thing, performs it straight, and when he doesn't, performs it crookeder than a dog's hind leg, and what he's going on about here, he obviously doesn't believe for a second. Anticipating the haunting that ensues, his scene with the writer goes on and on, around and around, long after it has made its point; and then the character, to clinch his presentation, produces a scrapbook of morgue shots of the room's earlier victims. Guess he keeps it for reminiscence' sake. Nevertheless undissuaded, the writer treks up to the room; and The Terror Begins. Or, well, not.<br/><br/>Note the job that the movie has set itself: it has promised not just a haunted room but the most haunted room ever, and the most deadly haunted room ever. To deliver on that, it has to show the most frightening chamber that ever was, containing the most frightening thing that ever was, and moreover, one that will explain to our complete satisfaction why the people who encounter it go loony and take out their eyes and do away with themselves. And beyond all that, the movie has (or ought) to tell us whether it's ""the room"" doing it, as we've been told, or some as yet unsuspected Lovecraftian entity that dwells there. <br/><br/>Does it need to be said that the movie fails to deliver? Of course, nothing it could conjure up could measure up to what it has led us to anticipate. The build-up was a terribly unwise tactic: like prefacing a joke by promising that it's the funniest joke you'll ever hear and that everyone who hears it laughs for weeks. Oversell. Moreover, we nver find out why the room is as it is, or just _how_ it is. One infers that what it assails each new guest with is a nonpareil...but what? the one phobia too frightening to confront? the one misdeed too enormous to acknowledge? the one memory too painful to recall? or what? One scene suggests the last, or might, if it weren't buried in a mass of irrelevant nonsense.<br/><br/>The haunting goes on. And on. And on--you think it's over, but no. The movie is much the same. It throws in everything but the kitchen sink (including a gollum living in the air ducts), and as it goes it keeps getting bigger, with enough catastrophe for a historical miniseries: flood, fire, earthquake...no childbirth, I don't think, but maybe I just missed it--and to ever-decreasing effect, like a horror Riverdance. Until the physical properties of the room came to exceed sensible bounds, what continued to occur to me was: why doesn't the guy bash through the wall? Indeed, at the end he does resort to destruction, of a kind, and it works. But by then there's no good reason why it should work, since nothing has worked before. There's no good reason for anything that happens in the movie. <br/><br/>Which makes it just noise."

","I had extremely high hopes for this one when seeing previews. I'd have to say that before I saw this, I was more excited than I had been in years to see a horror film. How could I not be excited, The Shining is one of my favorite movies and how could another horror film that takes place at a hotel be bad? Oh, 1408 will show you just how bad it can be. Now, I'm all for movies that are cramped, I enjoyed Signs, which all took place in the basement practically, Night of the Living Dead takes place mostly in a living room, but this movie couldn't pull off that feat of having very little locations. 1408 starts off so-so, the main character was developed well enough so that I liked him by the time he got to room 1408, and Samuel Jackson added a lot when explaining all the events that took place in the room, it's only after Cusack is in room 1408 for about 20 minutes that you start to wonder what the point is. You'll get the token sudden noises but you'll also get completely ridiculous events, like the painting scene. Just another example of CGI over story, I suggest you save your money or bum a friends copy. Gee, I'm starting to think that the Steven King fans are voting his movies high just because it's Steven King, nah, they wouldn't do that would they? ;)"

","I like John Cusack. Once upon a time, I liked Stephen King. I really like Samuel Jackson and Tony Shalub who are very competent character actors. So despite, the fact that there were stacks of copies piled up at the local video store, I decided to give this a try even though the reviews were less than stellar.<br/><br/>I am a human being, and therefore fallible and therefore capable of mistakes and I accept that and I accept that I made one when I paid five bucks to watch this thing. Then I made another when I actually watched it. So, to make amends for my error, and like Samuel Jackson, I am here to warn you to stay in another hotel room, do not go into 1408.<br/><br/>I haven't read the original story, but the thing bears enough resemblance to the Shining (which in turn was a clone of Richard Matheson's Hell House) that one can now conclude that Mr. King is now ""recycling"" himself instead of previous horror writers.<br/><br/>John Cusack is perversely fascinating to watch. He looks pudgy and burned out and apathetic throughout and that in turn is truly a horrifying thing to see for a guy who had such early promise. He is truly the haunted man searching for his lost career. I kept calling out to the screen, John, John, run.... run... get out of the movie now....<br/><br/>As for the visuals, no horror movie standby goes unused. Its all there, spooky noises, ghosts, the protagonist who does not believe in this stuff, blood and other gruesome stuff flowing inexplicably from nowhere, collapsing walls, weird hotel personnel, the long history of terrible events in the room and on and on and on until you completely lose track and ultimately, interest. If there was a point to it all, it got lost in the special effects.<br/><br/>I agree with the film's promotional material, you don't want to visit room 1408."

","Started so well ..<br/><br/>Then devolved (a most appropriate adjective) in to a typically Americanoid conglomerate of staged and often dated special effect snippets that leaves you yawning and wondering when all the fluff is going to end so the plot can resume. <br/><br/>The whole set looks exactly like a set. Reminded me of the Murder She Wrote episode from circa 1987 where power pad clad Jessica's law enforcement friend (the criminally obese one) chokes to death on a twinkie in suspicious circumstances. Deep stuff.<br/><br/>Not my all time favourite film then. But why? Well, you have a specific formula for horror movies, specifically specific if they are 'inspired by Stephen King short stories' ergo; they are gripping for the fifteen minutes or so the narrative follows the original prose, then utterly mind numbing for the proceeding two hours where a cocaine sodden Hollyrood script editor plumbed the depths of a socially retarded, sexual repressive sociopath's autobiography for material. <br/><br/>There is no plot. There is no spoon. No wait, am I dreaming? You get me. <br/><br/>The film drifts between genuinely scary and absurd.<br/><br/>There is no moral tale, it reminded me certainly of a Christmas Carol (I kid you not, its that bad) for the last forty-five minutes or more, but other than that it held nothing deeper, meaningful or insightful of impressionable merit. Not even a snifter of redemption: Our character is so fundamentally dull and unlikeable, I couldn't actually see much point to any supposed supernatural divinity taking much interest in him. I know I didn't. So his daughter died? Boo hoo. Its not enough to make me care. Even his estranged wife appears to have got over it. Absurdly. <br/><br/>Dross. Dull. Long. Slow. Staged. Corny. All suitable expletives.<br/><br/>Please, no really, stop plagiarizing second rate novellas and invest in someone with a smidgeon of talent to pen the scripts. American film, this one most specifically, needs to steer hard a starboard. Get away from 'man in action' segments that drag on and on and focus on what the French do so well: actual humanism. Dialogue. Meaning. Inference. Mise-en-scène.<br/><br/>Or, well, just don't and keep turning out more crap like this ..<br/><br/>John. I tried. I did. Truly I did. Mea culpa .."

It is not scary at all and every scene that you are supposed to get startled by, you know what is going to happen 1 min before it actually happens.<br/><br/>*************************** SPOILER ALERT **************************** There is however one surprising twist in the plot that later on turns out to be another illusion in Cusack's head.

","I really had high hopes for this movie, John Cusak, Samuel L. Jackson, Tony Shalhoub...so much talent, this movie had to be great, right? WRONG. Mr. Jackson and Mr. Shalhoub are in the movie a total of 20 mins or so combined. <br/><br/>Most of the movie is just John Cusak, ranting in his room, ohmygod did the manager dose the booze? I think so, but I'll just keep sucking it down anyway, tho i'm having a very bad trip. I was reminded of the movie Castaway with Tom Hanks, except the ever so charming Wilson, in this case, is his trusty micro-recorder. <br/><br/>There were hints that the experience was manufactured by the manager, such as the camera, the wires outside the window when he's hanging on by his elbows, the ghosts that appear to be video images, the manager with his ""well played mr. Enslin"" WTF?<br/><br/>This movie had no clear direction. Drugs? Ghosts? Electronic terror tactics? Mental breakdown?<br/><br/>In taking us out of the room and into reality and then back to the room and out into reality the movie really fails to answer any of these questions. The characters are flat. The logic uneven and completely illogical. <br/><br/>Though it was a painful and utterly frustrating experience I would love to see the DVD and see if this was the director's vision or did this go to the 6th level of hell in editing? Are there deleted or extended scenes, director or actor commentary that could shed some light on how a movie that seemed like it had so much potential could go so awry.<br/><br/>Honestly I'm scratching my head at all the positive comments I see here, this movie to me was pure drivel, aimed at the lowest common denominator."
"Chris Knipp","8","2","4","22 July 2007"," Do not stay at a Midtown hotel
","Four years ago in 2003 John Cusack starred in a movie about a murder motel where one person after another kept getting killed. In retrospect that may have been more fun to watch than his new one, '1408,' a claustrophobic psychological thriller about a doomed and horrible hotel room in Manhattan where Cusack's character is trapped and tormented all alone. The 2003 movie was called 'Identity,' and its payoff was very far-fetched. But it had Rebecca De Mornay, Alfred Molina, Gary Busey's son Jake, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet. In room 1408 there is only John Cusack and his demons. And a lot of special effects. Samuel L. Jackson is downstairs in a hotel manager's monkey suit, out of reach.<br/><br/>'1408' originated as a short story from the fevered imagination of Stephen King, whose plots often have a reflexive, boxes-within-boxes aspect. It concerns a writer who does books disproving that various locations are magical or haunted. One reviewer calls these ""paranormal guidebooks,"" but the point is he's a rationalist. He thinks he can stay in any haunted rooms without fear because he doesn't believe in ghosts; then he can write about them glibly and entertainingly. Though his aim is to debunk, his books are good for the hostelries' or haunted sites' business and they do a good business for themselves, though he's just a skilled hack and his latest reading is attended by under half a dozen people. What we learn later is that he is haunted himself by the death of a young daughter, and he ran out on his bereaved wife some time back.<br/><br/>Someone tips off Cusack's character, whose name is Mike Enslin, that he should not enter room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in midtown Manhattan. He decides that this is the perfect finale for his latest book, Ten Nights in Haunted Hotel Rooms. So room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel is where Enslin goes and where the action takes place. The hotel has turned down his request to stay in this room. He has used a lawyer and agent to force them to agree. When he arrives he is shunted to the office of the manager, Mr. Olin (Jackson), who repeats the history of the room to him and urges him not to enter it. No one has emerged alive from a night in it.<br/><br/>'1408' has been compared to Kubrick's film of 'The Shining,' because both stories are about writers shut up somewhere so claustrophobic it drives them nuts. But with all due respect to the director Mikael Håfström, he's no Kubrick.<br/><br/>In a story like this it's necessary to follow all the signals and suspend disbelief. But puzzles will remain. Supposing there were a hotel room like this where dozens of people had died of both natural and unnatural causes, chiefly suicide. Supposing all that were true. Why then would the hotel maintain the room in working order? If people have been dying horribly here since 1913, and an electrician as we see later refuses even to step into it, how come it has a working TV and clock radio, fully stocked bar, well made bed, up to date plumbing, and so forth? Why not just shut it down? Ostensibly, we're told, because hotels don't like to admit to bad luck just as they don't like to acknowledge having a thirteenth floor.<br/><br/>Let us go back to the fact that this comes from a short story, and note that the original master of such tales was Edgar Allen Poe. In them, the protagonist has some horrific experience, and then discovers--what? That there was some reasonable explanation? That it was a dream? Or not? The irony is that Stephen King invents a writer who debunks the kind of story he banks his own reputation on, and then gives him a very,very hard time, as one would stick pins in a voodoo doll. But due to the loyalty of the society of scriveners, he lets Enslin off in the end. Or does he? If 1408 comes close to being a superior example of the old fashioned kind of scary movie--not the ramped-up youthful gore-fest that now proliferates but an evisceration-free bit of teasing mental torture--it's because Mr. Håfström is a decent director; but most of all it's because John Cusack is a fine actor, who is capable of making his emotions seem real to us. And though '1408' is very much less pleasant to watch than the haunted murder-fest of Cusack's 2003 'Identity,' it's also arguably a piece with more class---because it's a mind game, not just a scare-filled whodunit.<br/><br/>The trouble with the making of '1408' was that even if $25 million isn't a big budget for Hollywood, it will buy you a lot of special effects if you're just working in a couple of rooms; and at some point the special effects grab the stage from Cusack: the hotel room is flooded or frozen over with snow or crumbling to pieces and covered with plaster dust. You're not inside Mike Enslin's head any more so much as you are simply on a film set the F/X people are having a ball with. It's a relief to be reminded that it's just a movie and you can get off the edge of your seat. But that's not what's supposed to happen, of course. You're supposed to stay on the edge till the end. Seeing John Cusack in this kind of movie makes me miss those great youth pictures of the Eighties in which he was a key participant. He's still a terrific actor, with greatly more well-developed chops. But he's in a losing battle with the plaster and fake snow, and that's a shame."

","Let's face it, when it comes to the horror genre, only half the films work and the rest just plain suck. I mean how many times are we gonna get the usual jump and shriek moments? They mostly become all to cliché and boring. Don't you remember the old days of the Exorcist, Poltergist, The Shining, even Nightmare On Elm Street where films actually made you heart beat go faster and faster with every unforeseen scare and haunting atmospheres that made you spine tingle? I mean there have been a few gems since then(The Sixth Sense, The Ring etc.) But they are all too far and in between, and the inevitable horror sequels just ruin the concepts(The Ring 2, The Grudge 2...EHW!) While I heard and saw the trailer for 1408, I didn't find much interest in it since it goof be the usual few scare, but flat in the end. But thankfully I got to see the movie in theaters and I was truly blow away! <br/><br/>Micheal Enslin is a successful writer making a profit out of writing books from ""supposed"" haunted hotels, but continuing to seek an actual paranormal event. When he gets a postcard about the room 1408, he is all to eager to stay in the infamous hotel and gets more than he ever imagined! 1408 is a horror film that works on all levels. You knew from the first scare that this would be the first of many! Never has a film captured a haunting atmosphere and intense horror in a film since the Shining! Micheal Cusack gives probably one of his best performances to date. From his confident attitude to his descent into insanity to his remorse over his daughter, he plays all his scenes masterfully and convinces throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also superb as usual playing the Dolphin Hotel Manager who warns Enslin about the room. The psychological aspect of the film is played out flawlessly. The room does the unthinkable time and time again to Enslin that even the audience gets psyched out many times. Like one scene in particular where Enslin is trying to get help from the apartment across the street, it's one of the most imaginative and scariest scenes I've ever scene in a horror film! There are also other scenes where you literally thrown a loop and can't tell if these things are truly happening or if it's all in Enslin's head. Also love how the room unravels Enslin's past right in front of him giving the audience the back story not known about at the beginning of the film. You can't help but feel sorry for Enslin as he is tortured by his past and there is literally no escape. But the creepiest aspect of the film would have to be once you enter the room, the room knows more about you than you know about yourself! All and All, 1408 is refreshing and brings back classic horror not seen in years. I never thought a Stephen King novel adaption film could ever touch the Shining, but 1408 rivals that film with ease. A must see!"
"Promontorium","10","2","4","10 July 2007"," Best scary movie in the 21st Century
","I can only give my opinion, as movies touch people differently. I can tell you, I am someone who has not been scared by movies since the 80's. Not 80's movies Per-Se, simply the decade itself. By the time the 90's came I was 8 years old, and no longer scared of anything fictional, until 1408.<br/><br/>I have read several Steven King books, and literally dozens (if not all) of his published short stories. 1408 the story was boring, and really short. Dude gets a talking to, walks into room (once he could get it open, different in the movie) some pictures move, some words appear and he's out. That was it. I love Steven King but 1408 the story was crap. I say this so you don't decide to stay away from the movie because of the story.<br/><br/>This movie blew my mind. It is so much more deep than I could imagine a scary movie could be. It sucked me in from minute one and I was literally on the edge of my seat the whole movie. It scared the crap out of me, and yet the few moments of peace he gets once in the room (like seeing his daughter)(not a spoiler its in the damn previews) made me feel so overwhelmed with emotion that I sometimes just begged for some more basic thrills to come. It pushes and pushes, and just when you think it's selling you short, it tricks you, and scares even more. Hands down the best scary movie/thriller/whatever in the 21st Century. If you have any dignity and you like scary movies, or thrillers, or even plot for that matter, you have to watch this masterpiece to the very end."

","This adaption of a Stephen King novel finds John Cusack as a writer specializing in debunking the occult and makes a pretty good living at it. He's informed about a room at the Dolphin Hotel on Lexington and East 45 Street in Manhattan, number 1408 which has an unusual number of deaths associated with it. You know he's got to check this one out.<br/><br/>It's a Stephen King book so you know the rumors are going to be well founded. Most of the film involves John Cusack in that room 1408 all by himself dealing with an occult freak show. Needless to say, he's a believer by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Cusack does a good job as the cynical writer who turns into a believer. If you listen faintly into the background you can just hear Bert Lahr saying, ""I do believe in spooks, I do, I do, I do.""<br/><br/>If this kind of film is what you like than this film will be to your liking.

I was really surprised to see John Cusack starring in a scary movie, but he pulled it off well. I don't want to ruin it for anyone but I think a lot of people are confused at the ending. I strongly believe that he is still in room 1408 at the end, because he plays the recording machine and his daughter says: I don't ever want to leave you ( or somewhere along those lines) therefore, he is still in room 1408 in the end, or that is what I believe.

It's based off a Stephen King, and is LOADS better than all those TV movies that use his name for some reason.<br/><br/>The film involves supernatural-yet-skeptic writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack, in a meaty role that suits his wonderful talent), who stays a night in room 1408 (1 + 4 + 0 + 8 = what?) at the Dolphin Hotel, despite being told no by Samuel L. Jackson over and over again. No one says no to Sam Jackson! That should be a new movie rule. They have a couple of good scenes together and then Cusack goes into the room, and there are enough ""holy *insert swearword here*"" moments to more than satisfy any horror fan, myself included. There's very little gore and blood, but fans of those probably already went to see Hostel II. This movie is for people who like their scares cerebral. There's loads of creepy atmosphere and this is what last year's ""Silent Hill"" endeavored to be.<br/><br/>The movie starts up slow, then builds intensity as Cusack realizes what he's gotten himself into, but by then it's to late. It would be criminal to reveal too much, but the room basically toys with him and you mentally and physically for an hour. Cusack acts very well, as all hope slowly escapes him. He pretty much holds up the human spectrum of the film, but the Room is a marvelous creature. The film kind of lags a little at the end, as it's a concept movie, and nearly all concept movies crap out a little. But man, talk about a hidden gem among the granite! This is the scariest movie since last year's ""The Descent"", and it's still at a mild PG-13. I'm not sure if it would hold up to repeat viewings, but a high B+"

","Did you see ""Derailed""? Yeah. Not too good. But Mikael Hafstrom is back, with an 180-degree-turn-around of a movie, starring John Cusack and Samuel Jackson. Adapted from the Stephen King short story of the same name, ""1408"" tells the story of Mike Enslin, an acerbic, acid-tongued writer traipsing around the world, proclaiming everywhere that ghosts don't exist. He also does so in his books, which aren't particularly well-received; it's more like they're not received at all, really. The film opens with Mike checking into a supposedly-haunted bed and breakfast on a dark and stormy night. Hafstrom doesn't even try to trick us into believing something scary will happen; he runs the opening credits during Mike's stay at the hotel. It's this kind of assurance and strong-handedness that makes ""1408"" so compulsively watchable, and entertaining on many levels. In watching the film, you feel like you're watching a film by a director who knows what he's doing, and who is confident in the final product. This isn't always a good thing (Michael Bay is one example) but Mikael Hafstrom, at least in this film, is very much rock-solid. Mike gets a letter in the mail which leads him, by way of his local library, to The Dolphin Hotel at 45th and Lexington in New York City. In the hotel is notorious room 1408, which has caused over sixty deaths. Why would the hotel still be in business? We don't know. But it doesn't matter. It's Mike's prerogative to check into the room and prove, once and for all, that ""ghosties and goulies"" don't exist. Mike is able to check into ""1408"", despite much confrontation between himself and The Dolphin hotel's owner, played by Samuel L. Jackson. As you may guess, the room is full of nightmarish activity, and John Cusack is suddenly in a hotel room alone, and he gives a superb performance. Overall, ""1408"" is a very entertaining movie. Stephen King provides great material for film, stories that are frightening, but also full of insight into the human condition. It hasn't been since ""The Green Mile"" that Stephen King's material was translated so well to the big screen; the writers take the characters, story, and emotional insight, but also something decidedly King-ian: his sense of play and fun amidst the horror. This becomes very apparent in the film's twisty ending. The really only solid performance in the movie is Cusack, the rest are so-so. But it really doesn't matter; Cusack shares the screen with only a few ghosts, and for only a few seconds. Combine that with Hafstrom's eye-popping visual effects, and the detectable presence of Stephen King, and you've got a brilliant film."

","First I should say I went in with high expectations, based on reviews I had read here. I'm usually disappointed, but this time I wasn't. The story has a good pace. They don't feel the need to explain every little detail, which is always appreciated. The special effects were used quite a bit, not overused, and there were some classic camera tricks that I really enjoyed. Overall, very well done. I did get scared at some points, but I was never grossed out and you don't have to watch any long, dull, uncomfortable torture scenes - though there is plenty psychological torture. And the best part is you don't really know how it's going to end - I'm sure you could guess if you tried, but they don't give everything away before it happens. I have to agree with one of the other reviews I read - the sound editing is outstanding as well. Early in the movie the main character's ears start to ring. Ususally having your ears ring is a very internal experience - your the only one who can hear it and it's just in your head. I think that scene really sucks you into the movie physically. <br/><br/>Overall, I would say it's the best new horror movie I've seen in years. Not just a good horror, but a good movie."

","Although I enjoy all sorts of films, I seem to be most critical of horror and SciFi. I am able to suspend disbelief without any trouble, which might account for my enjoyment of so many movies, but once broken I have trouble buying into the plot line. Having said that, there are a few times 1408 started to loose me; however, there were enough unexpected twists to the story to make the film satisfying in the end.<br/><br/>The best movie villains are unseen and subtle. Think of Jaws. 1408 starts off that way, but then relies on over the top special effects to thrill and frighten the audience. Had that part of the film been less over stated, the over all results would have been much better.<br/><br/>John Cusack's performance is solid and he was able to keep me engaged even when the story began to fall apart for me. Also, Samuel L Jackson can do no wrong in my eyes. The cinematography and artistic direction could have been more creative.<br/><br/>It's a great show to see at the drive-in with a bunch of friends, but I doubt it's destined to become a classic."

Director Mikael Hafstrom (""Derailed"") handles the tension pretty well.<br/><br/>John Cusack, at his most cynical, is on screen nearly every moment of the movie. He definitely brought his A game with him, probably thankful that his character is a bit beaten down rather than his usual overly-energetic and cutesy. As a researcher and writer of spiritual phenomenon, he long ago gave up hope of reaching the afterworld.<br/><br/>Welcome to hotel manager Samuel L. Jackson's worst weekend getaway ...

What really makes this one click is the mental side of the story ... a King specialty. Most horror writers forget, or are not talented enough, to write stories that stimulate the brain ... they only goes for the visuals.<br/><br/>Even though Cusack hogs the screen time, some support work is provided by a creepy Samuel L. Jackson, Mary McCormack (Russell Crowe's wife in ""Mystery, Alaska""), Tony Shalhoub (""Monk"") and Jasmine Jessica Anthony as Cusack's dead daughter.

","I just got home from seeing 1408. I am a huge horror fan, though I usually leave most modern horror movies feeling let down. 1408 lived up to everything a horror fan is looking for. I don't want to reveal too much about the plot. Although all you have to do is read others reviews if you want more details. Suffice it to say this. I have been watching horror movies for as far back as I can remember ( and I am almost 39 ) This is the best horror movie I have seen in at least 10yrs. It has a lot of The Shining feel to it. However it did not steal from the Shining at all. One other thing. I love John Cusack. However he hasn't done a decent movie since High Fidelity. He is a quirky kind of actor and only certain material suits him. I have seen him trying miserably to fit into the leading man rolls lately. Even though he is an excellent actor, they just don't seem to fit him. I was so glad to see him back in his element. He did keep up one of his film trademarks in this movie. The the pouring down like cats and dogs rainstorm, which he always emerges from soaking wet . For some reason that always cracks me up how he works that into almost every one of his movies. So back to 1408. Excellent! Two thumbs way up from me. Also do see it in the theater,the chills will be much chillier. In the showing I was in some young girl of course right behind me...Screamed bloody murder LOUDLY during one heart pounding scare. Which in turn made me almost pee my pants.

","The movie stays very true to the story. It doesn't try to cheapen what King was trying to do, and it keeps the story fairly simple. I thought it would be really hard to transfer the short story of 1408 from page to screen, because it is so character driven, but it was done very well.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about 1408 was that it didn't need dramatic swells in the music to scare you. This movie is one of the view horror movies that has been released recently that is genuinely scary past the ""jump out at you"" moments.

","I must say ""1408"" is a well done ghost story of the mind and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. John Cusack is a California ghost writer, who has a unique hobby of traveling the country investigating reports of ghosts in legendary hotels. His work includes spending the night to disprove the theories. Well once he learns about the Dolphin Hotel in New York city it has room 1408 he's now in the big leagues of ghost and terror. The scenes of ghosts, shadows, voices, dreams, are similar and bring viewers to think of hotel terror classics like ""The Shining"" and ""Psycho"". The countdown for life is monitored by the clock alarm radio that will countdown from 60 minutes till 0! This film is great mind terror a real good head trip that makes the viewer think is it a dream or real.

","Mike Enslin is a writer who loathes the subject matter of his books. Jaded by the untimely death of his daughter, Enlsin puts no stock in anything broaching the religious or supernatural. To Mike, if he can't see it or touch it, it's not real and can't happen. Which is why this writer of haunted hotel travelogues views his chosen profession as just another means to a paycheck. He's not even remotely into his work because he views it as a dead end (pardon the pun) before it even starts.<br/><br/>That is, until he receives a mysterious unsigned post card from New York's Dolphin Hotel with the singular cryptic message  ""Don't stay in 1408"". 1+4+8=13. With that Enslin's curiosity is piqued.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by Stephen King, and capably directed by Swede Mikael Håfström, 1408 is a throwback to old fashioned haunted house movies like 1973's The Legend of Hell House, allowing the fear and tension to ratchet up in tiny increments, largely driven by small, out of place events, and things you don't actually see.<br/><br/>Fans drawn by the presence of Samuel L. Jackson will be in for a letdown, however. Although he shares co-billing, Jackson's role is a relatively small one. This is John Cusack's (Enslin) movie, and it's pretty much a one actor show. Surprisingly, Cusack does a good job portraying a man who may or may not be the victim of his own inner ghosts, or, alternately, waging a one man war against a ""truly evil f*****g room"", as Jackson's hotel manager character describes it.<br/><br/>Seeing as the horror genre is becoming increasingly populated with the gruesome torture porn of films like Hostel and Touristas, 1408, in all it's throwback glory, is a refreshing breath of fetid air."

","Based on the short Stephen King horror story of the same name, 1408 surrounds supernatural writer Mike Enslin, an author of two hit books focusing on supernatural phenomena. As research for his latest book, Enslin is determined to check out the notorious room 1408 in a New York City hotel by personally staying as a guest in the fabled room. With the intention that 1408 is just a myth perpetuated by stories and rumor that Enslin has collected for his past works. However, hotel manager Mr. Olin has strong objections to Enslin's stay and only warns him of possible danger to come. But Enslin is determined to go through and convinced that the horrific past of 1408 is just mere coincidence and a myth. But what Mike Enslin is about to experience is no myth, as 1408 truly is a room where the guests don't lasts more than an hour.<br/><br/>When I was watching the trailer of the film, I was so excited because it looked so intense and thrilling. Then it turned out to be PG-13, which got me disappointed. Well, a PG-13 horror film with an intense trailer must be great, right? Right. It's rare for me to like a horror film or a PG-13 horror film. There are so many torture porn released these days that this film saved the day.<br/><br/>It's more like a psychological thriller rather than a horror, in the vein of The Twilight Zone and The Sixth Sense. Instead of buckets or gore and guts, this film is rather creepy and unsettling with it's classic scares and great sound work. I mean, it's a loud, LOUD movie. I love the dark atmosphere and the claustrophobic feel of the film.<br/><br/>The look of the film is fantastic, with an 80s feel. This film is (although not as scary as I thought) scary and not many films can scare me. It's more suspense than scary. There is excellent writing throughout the film with solid performances mostly by John Cusack (not to mention Mary McCormack and Samuel L. Jackson). I love the creepy score and cinematography of the film.<br/><br/>This is a film that you wouldn't expect to go deep through the emotions. It's the fear of losing someone that makes this film good. It's rather heartbreaking. Mikael Håfström directed this film also directed Derailed (Well, I also liked that film) and is a fine film to add to his collection.<br/><br/>With great sound work, solid performances, and great writing, this is one of the few surprises this summer.

This movie is not as brainlessly gratuitous as those, but you can switch off and enjoy about 90 minutes of John Cusack losing his cool.

","Imagine if you will; a horror writer that only believes in what he can see and is to be haunted by something so safe as ""We've Only Just Begun"" by the Carpenters. Based on a scary short story by the king of the macabre Stephen King. Mike Enslin(John Cusack)is a renowned horror novelist that has written a string of best sellers dealing with infamous haunted houses and hotels. And the occasional graveyard. He has no proof of the afterlife, so he makes a living debunking them in his books. His life changes forever when he decides to stay overnight in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in New York City. He arrives wearing his lucky Hawaaian shirt and a cigarette behind his ear. The hotel manager Mr. Olin(Samuel L. Jackson)warns Enslin to not stay in room 1408, where at least a dozen people have committed suicide and near 30 have died 'naturally'. Enslin will be the first person to stay in room 1408 since 1978. And the average time of stay is between 60 to 70 minutes; one way or another the occupant cuts their stay short. Enslin is a skeptic that becomes a true believer as he barely survives the night. He comes short of saying the room is haunted...but it is the dwelling of something pretty damn evil.<br/><br/>Some very good F/X and spectacular photography. You will squirm and flinch and try to pretend you aren't scared. Popcorn will definitely hide in your clothes and hit the floor. This may be the best Cusack has ever been. Jackson is strong and authoritative. Also in the cast: Tony Shalhoub, Mary McCormack, Andrew Lee Potts and Jasmine Jessica Anthony. This movie does Stephen King good.

","""1408"" is one of the movies that can give you a hard time when you're watching it at home alone in the dark. We get to know the story of an author that earns his living writing books about haunted hotels, who has to realize that not every case is just a hoax. Of course this is a story already told so often that it is quite a lazy attempt to reflect this in the movie itself. This is by no means a creative movie, regarding the story. Nonetheless it is quite enjoyable for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>The movie starts off rather slowly, the first paranormal phenomenons are still quite decent and that's something I really liked. Later on, unfortunately, they get the hammer out and at the latest when our hero lays in a room covered in snow, things shifted towards a bit too much. So why should you give this movie a try then? Because it achieves one of the most crucial things a horror film can achieve: It actually makes you feel uneasy. You can relate to the situation of the protagonist and you want to get out. It is exactly this feeling that makes this movie something special, achieved through clever ideas, a bit of well-proved horror tools and some plot-twists.<br/><br/>You don't necessarily have to have seen this movie, I wouldn't go that far. But if you're looking for some paranormal frightening action, this is what you're searching for."

"OllieSuave-007","6","0","0","19 June 2014"," Eerily confusing.
","As with many of the more recent horror films from Hollywood, 1408 is a creepy but confusing movie - a story where supernatural writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack) travels to New York to spend one night in the Dolphin Hotel, attempting to debunk the mystery of the unavailable room 1408, in which prior guests disappear in after checking in.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the plot gives you a subtle but eerie feeling that reminds viewers of the mystery of Room 1408; even a close-up of the key unlocking the door to the room was filmed in dramatic fashion. Enslin checking into the forbidden 1408 will make you nervously anxious to see what supernatural events will occur around him and to see if he will survive the ordeal - all making this a somewhat scary movie.<br/><br/>I liked how you can feel the unease and terror surrounding Enslin, but his portrayal by Cusack was sub-par at best - pretty emotionless. While the plot is quick-paced, there are many twists and turns that may confuse the viewers, especially during the climax, and many plot elements are unexplained (i.e., why is the room evil?).<br/><br/>There are many other horror flicks out there that have more captivating and dramatic stories. This one is good for a few scares, but the confusing plot points might leave you mind boggled and you might be tempted to re-watch it just to understand the film better.<br/><br/>Grade C+"
"KentaroK","7","0","0","15 March 2014"," Good at what it does, but not really my cup of tea.
","For a movie named ""1408"", it is sort of hard not to spoil it. The name itself is a spoiler. Nonetheless, I will try to avoid them, even though I am marking this review as ""contains spoilers"".<br/><br/>Firstly, I rate this two notches above average for the genre of suspense/thriller. The visual effect, acting, and pacing are well done. Technically, I cannot complain that anything broke my ""suspension of disbelief"".<br/><br/>On the other hand, the visual effects and so forth go too far, in my opinion, to illustrate the strange things which the main character experiences. Perhaps fans of Inception will like it, because although it is not that outlandish, the surreal nature reminds me of such. The difference is, in Inception, you expect ""dream world"". In this, you really can't tell when you should expect real vs. dreams.<br/><br/>That is intentional and helps to keep you ""on your toes"", but somehow, I did not enjoy it as much as I would a simpler story with less effects, but more character development, information on the history or nature of the paranormal, or some form of involved process of change or redemption for some major character.<br/><br/>So, although I cannot complain, and some people might rate it 10/10, for me, it was missing something that I come to expect from stories. It is difficult for me to explain what, but, if you like a movie that will keep you on your toes and let you identify with a skeptic who is forced to believe in the paranormal (or, at least, some sort of evil influence, perhaps as benign as some form of drugs), you will find that in this movie.<br/><br/>So, again, good at what it does, but not really my cup of tea.<br/><br/>Sorry if this is too vague, what few major surprises they are (which were not already given by posters, synopsis, et cetera), I would rather not mention, because, really, this is the hardest movie ever not to spoil."

","""1408"" is one of the good Stephen King adaptations, one that maintains its author's satirical view of human nature. However, it's not the script (by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski) that deserves most of the credit. Director Mikael Hafstrom ""Derailed"" (2005), who fares far better here than his debut, never resorts to the cheap tricks and gruesome visuals, while creating scares through a suffocating sense of claustrophobia and suspense. The movie appeals to an old-fashioned sense of horror that differs from your typical slasher flicks loaded with unrelenting carnage. <br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a professional skeptic. He makes his living by visiting supposed haunted houses and writing about the absence of ghosts. For him, room 1408 at New York's Dolphin Hotel is too good a challenge to pass up. In its nearly 100 years of existence, 56 people have died in that room. The hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson) advises in the strongest terms that Mike not stay there. ""No one,"" he advises, ""has lasted more than an hour."" At first, Mike is not impressed by the ordinariness of the accommodations. Then strange things begin happening, and by the time he decides that checking out early might be the wisest decision, that option no longer exists. <br/><br/>Too often, we see a movie with a good setup ruined with a subpar ending. ""1408"" deftly sidesteps the pitfall, delivering a conclusion that manages not to disappoint, while at the same time leaving things open-ended enough for viewer interpretation. Most of the movie focuses on Cusack, alone in his room, trapped in an escalating environment of paranoia. He uses his good natured disposition to get the audience's acceptance, and once that's accomplished, the film has us. It's riveting to watch his cynicism and disbelief give way to the horror of what is actually happening. Despite Mike's mantra ""We don't rattle, do we?"" The answer is in fact, we do."

","The film,it seems, has 2 endings with one being the original one and the other one being conjured after the first one was sensed to be a little disappointing. Whatever it may be, the movie has a hell lotta places where you find yourself at the edge of your seats. When other horror movies are following a recipe book, this one comes up with a flummoxing entanglement of events and realizations. Elsin, who apparently is a writer of paranormal books and who supposedly doesn't believe in the authenticity of third world forces, gets a challenge when some ostensibly anonymous person sends him a postcard suggesting about the Dolphin Hotel in New York and advises him not to enter the room no. 1408.. Elsin, who takes this up as a challenge makes sure that he does enter the room once and survives for more than an hour - something that 56 people acc. to the manager failed to do in the past 95 years. Initially, Elsin's doubts seem right with nothing unusual happening in the room but the moment the radio clock starts by itself and plays the song ""we've just begun"" and sets the timer to 60 minutes, you're already begun with the real 60 minutes that this movie is all about. And in actuality, 60 minutes in the movie nearly amount to 60 minutes of your viewing time.. Really worth a watch.. :)"

","I've got to admit, when I saw the trailer for 1408 I thought that it looked a bit naff. OK, so it may have been a few years ago but I can still remember some images that looked slightly try-hard. However, when I saw that my favourite critic gave it 5 stars (usually what he loves, I love) I thought that I should give it a chance. After all, I'm a great fan of the horror genre and the idea of someone trying to survive the night in a haunted hotel room does sound very appealing to me. However, by the end of it the major feeling which I felt was disappointment. Ultimately 1408 was not scary like everyone said it was and I didn't think that the story was strong enough to hold my attention for it's entire running time. However, that's not to say that it's terrible and I regret buying it, because I don't think I do.<br/><br/>First off, I loved the build-up. I loved how we followed the likable if not cocky character of John Cusack, I liked how we got to see his work and what he did etc. I also loved the cryptic postcard sending him to room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. I also loved the whole background of the hotel and how it kept us in suspense as to what is so terrible about the room. What I loved the most, and what I think was possibly the best scene in the film, was the confrontation between John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson, the hotel manager. The dialogue was involving and it really made you want to see what was going to happen in that room! The whole build-up to getting to the room in the lift and everything was also brilliant! Of course, a build-up like this which offers great things could easily turn into a let-down, and I'm afraid that that's what it ultimately did.<br/><br/>The simplicity of the room was wonderful. There seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary with it and nothing spooky happened for a while, until the digital clock turns into a countdown. Now I was thinking that this is when things are about to pick up and poor old John Cusack is going to have the night of his life! Which he does, but unfortunately I didn't get the night of my life. For me it almost seemed like an unfunny version of the Evil Dead 2 at times. With it aborting to cheap and clichéd haunted house scares such as the wall suddenly being cracked and blood coming through it, the clock working even though it's unplugged etc. It even seemed desperate at times to scare you such as with the living corpse in the pipey thing, but it's something we've all seen before and seen much better.<br/><br/>1408 sort of became repetitive, with the room constantly changing, showing how it's messing with John Cusack's mind without really having much to say. I felt that it had similar themes and ideas that were explored much, much more effectively and emotionally in Shutter Island. However, the film was undeniably effective at getting inside John's head. I felt that I was going as crazy as he was at times! There's a wonderfully claustrophobic atmosphere and sense of entrapment. The room was also incredibly cruel at times, which I liked (not in a sick way). I also have to admit that the directing and camera-work was superb, it never made you feel bored about being in the room, it was just the room's constant mind blows that became boring. It did make me feel dizzy at times and for that I applaud it.<br/><br/>It's just a shame that the story wasn't strong enough! The whole idea with the flashbacks was wonderful, but there simply wasn't enough there to sustain attention. In the end it just became a film showing off its big budget with endless gimmicks that became tiresome and not at all scary. 1408 does however have redeeming factors, and it did effectively eff my mind, but I was ultimately left feeling disappointed and I think that the film could've offered me more. In addition, John Cusack did give a really brilliant performance as Stephen King adaptations often do. However I'd stick to the likes of The Shining, Misery and Carrie, for this is unfortunately not up there with them."

","Master horror writer and cultural icon Stephen King has had over 30 stories adapted into movies or T.V. mini series. ""1408"" is one of the more successful film adaptations in recent memory. Starring John Cusack in a sort of one man performance as Mike Enslin. Enslin is a struggling writer who has just completed his latest book on haunted hotels. He is a non believer in ghosts and ghoulies and has lost his spiritual faith as well when his young daughter dies from a terminal illness. He has turned into a cold and cynical man looking for something in life and just can't find it until he gets a post card from the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.<br/><br/>Mike is from New York but since the death of his daughter Katie, he has left his wife and moved to Hermosa Beach, California. He receives all kinds of mail from across the country from supposed haunted hotels that want him to stay the night. He is drawn back home to New York and the Dolphin Hotel as he seems destined to stay in room 1408. Sam Jackson plays the hotels manager Mr. Olin, who warns Mike about the room and its history. How 56 people who have stayed in 1408 have died, some of natural causes, several suicides, and many other questionable deaths. ""Nobody has lasted more than an hour in 1408"" says Mr. Olin. Mike is on a mission and no mater what he is told he will stay in 1408 and that is final.<br/><br/>Upon arrival Mike is thoroughly unimpressed. The bland furnishings and clichéd art on the walls is thoroughly mocked as he talks into his trusty tape recorder. He settles in with a free bottle of expensive booze and starts to pass the time when things start to get a little eerie. Mike is not easily rattled but he starts to become unglued pretty quickly as things start to happen. The radio turns on and ominously plays ""We've only just begun"" by The Carpenters. Mike take a psychological ass kicking that propels the remainder of the movie. Director Mikael Hafstrom has included a few homages to other great psychological horror films as he has the walls crack open like in Polanski's ""Repulsion"" and a snow covered scene that brings back images of Kubrick's ""The Shining"". This movie doesn't approach that level of greatness but is still a good film non the less. John Cusack acts alone in a room for most of the film and pulls off an amazing performance. The movie boils down to a man who is having trouble dealing with the death of his daughter, even though in flashbacks Katie assures him ""everyone dies daddy"".<br/><br/>""1408"" is well made, well, acted and worth checking out so watch it tonight."

His interest piqued, he sets out to include this room as a closer for his latest book - 10 Haunted Hotels.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson plays a stunning cameo role as the hotel manager determined to prevent Cusack from staying in the room, even to the extent of giving him a file on all the deaths that have taken place in it. Nevertheless, Cusack won't be swayed.<br/><br/>The rest of the film I leave for you to enjoy. It's a visual and directorial masterpiece where the viewer can have no idea what the ending is actually going to be, so I shall not spoil it for you here. Just remember, this film actually feels more like a one-man-show theatre piece than a fully-cast film. Stylistically it's claustrophobic with most of the weight of the plot being borne only by Cusack. Actually, everyone else in the film can really be regarded as having only cameo roles.<br/><br/>I've only awarded 7/10 simply because I found the film rather uneven in tone in places and I have a tendency to dislike films where the ending isn't completely resolved.

","Every so often, I come across a movie that I had never heard of and had no expectations for whatever that surprises me with a great storyline, an awesome script, and a stunning cast performance. This was one of them.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by Stephen King, 1408 stars John Crusack and Samuel L. Jackson. Be aware, though, there are two very different versions of the film between the various releases; and, whether you love it or think its mediocre will depend on which version you see (and, of course, your own personal taste). The version that I think is a creative masterpiece is the one the studio released for the European market. The European release was also released in the US on Pay-Per-View On-Demand as the ""Director's Cut"" and is also the default version of the Blu-Ray release.<br/><br/>The US release of the film that distributed in movies theaters and shown on premium cable TV is a last minute studio cut, an effort on the behalf of the studio to give the film ""greater appeal for an American audience"". The flawed thinking here was that Americans like ""optimistic"" endings rather than the gloomy endings the likes of The Twilight Zone are known for. Suffice-it to say, the studio cut out the entire original ending and shot a new shorter, lower budget, not-so-scary and not-so- inspired one to replace it. Additionally, the US release cut out some important secondary character subplot elements.<br/><br/>John Crusack and Samuel L. Jackson give stunning performances. However, the US version cuts out one of the movie's best performances by Jackson, one that adds a great deal of depth to the character performed by Crusack. I am just baffled as to why studio execs would meddle with a filmmaker's artistic work. Studio heads are not artists and should not interfere with their work, especially rewriting an entire ending.<br/><br/>With the different versions of the film now off my chest, what I really loved about it was the fact that most of the film takes place inside a single location - a hotel room - and revolves around a single main character. Going into it, I wondered how on Earth could a solitary room and character possibly be scary. Without giving anything away, believe you me, Stephen King's warped imagination ingeniously has a way! With the Stephen King short story as the backbone, the movie's brilliantly written screenplay adds bone-chilling, cliff-hanging suspense and thrills that builds upon character development.<br/><br/>If you like the original version of this film as much as I do, other great movies of the same genre that I recommend are Wind Chill, White Noise, and The Mist."
"Corky1984","Null","0","0","29 December 2010"," genuinely chilling horror
","I don't tend to enjoy horror films, but 1408 was absolutely stunning. The plot was simple, but well-executed. John Cusack plays a writer who churns out populist 'haunted house' books which expose the myths and hearsay of hotel owners eager to pull the wool over tourists' eyes. He receives word that room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel has a blood-curdling past and is eager to stay in the room to prove that it is all made-up. He arrives at the hotel and the manager, played by Samuel L Jackson, does everything he can to talk him out of staying in 1408, but Cusack persists and gets his way. As Cusack is taken up to his floor by lift, the anticipation builds and Jackson offers one final warning, but his advice is rejected. Cusack checks into room 1408 and has no idea what is in store for him. At first glance, he is totally unimpressed and believes the room is just like any other. His cynicism lulls him into a false sense of security. Hereafter, the film really starts to get tense, as small oddities begin to occur and you get the sense that Cusack isn't alone in the room. Before long, Cusack himself grows concerned and his early swagger is replaced by mounting fear. The suspense of the film increases and increases, with Cusack coming under siege from numerous evil spirits and ghosts. He seeks in vain to escape the room, but to no avail, before a few red herrings indicate it was all a dream. He wakes up on a beach and is seemingly free from a vivid nightmare. Yet this is all an illusion and he finds that he never escaped. Ultimately, it becomes plain that he will never leave room 1408 and he goes out with a bang, destroying it in a haze of flames. There were so many genuinely chilling moments, that this has to rank as one of the best horrors for many years. It had echoes of the Shining. Definitely a film worth watching."

He plans to use his observations for a chapter in his book, but instead he goes on the ride of his life<br/><br/>I think I can see 1408 working as a short story, but as a movie it feels overlong, and overstuffed. There isn't enough plot to sustain a hundred minute running length. 1408 tries too hard. The horror devices are force fed to us in such a way that the movie never feels truly scary. It is certainly startling, no question there. 1408 doesn't generate suspense as much as it generates a sense of entrapment. We have nowhere to go. Unfortunately neither does the story, and it takes forever to end. <br/><br/>I think one of the worst decisions that 1408 makes is that it ignores the value of claustrophobia. The picture is surprisingly over lit for a horror film, perhaps as an attempt to avoid unrealistic lighting clichés. The camera is quite wide, and there is always to much in the frame. The room itself doesn't feel scary at all, and the devices used to make it scary are familiar and there are too many of them. The windows shutting is one that particularly bothers me, because it feels just plain unrealistic. PArt way through the film, 1408 attempts to justify this unrealism by turning it to surrealism. It becomes more of a fantasy, with rooms in the fridge and snow falling, paintings coming alive. <br/><br/>1408 is a very relentless film, it never lets up, to some degree it entertains, but it's too heavy handed for comfort and is never scary or clever enough to pass for a good horror movie. It's just a watchable one"

Beside the beginning and the ending, the whole movie just shows the desperate main character in this evil room with an own life, but it really works. Its thrilling, and surprising twists give the plot a flow and manage to create an unpromising evil atmosphere. The ending is unfortunately a bit uninspired and somehow breaks the logic of the movie, but that can't really destroy the joy of watching this man fighting this room of horror. Sadly it is irreproducible how a thinking human can decide to go into a room, where 56 persons verifiably died, whether you believe in a room's own life or not.<br/><br/>Still I really can recommend this movie, especially for people who are tired of bad slasher horror and who are interested in a clever and thrilling story that is able to keep suspense from the beginning till the end"

","The big - and it's BIG - problem with this film as a horror/suspense flick is simple, and it's all a spoiler: the set-up is far too overdone and the hotel room doesn't begin to live up to it. We're told of horrors so consistently unspeakable that guest after guest mutilates, blinds, castrates himself or herself. A lot. One maid gouged out her eyes after merely moments in the bathroom. And the bulk of the movie simply can't deliver anything that would remotely bring such extremes on. OK, Cusack sees painful ghosts from his past. He also has (harmless)phantoms swinging axes at him and others walking past him to defenestrate themselves yet again. Everything else - chiefly the rooms altered dimensions and implosion - are pretty much triggered by his own actions. As absurd as it sounds, I finished watching, thinking: it ain't all that bad a suite, really. Moreover, again, the filmmakers went way, way too far in promising unheard of nightmare experience. PS Oh, Mr. King. Please. Enough with the cynical writer/hero who wants to write Real Literature but settles for hack work.

Mike ignores the advice and stays.<br/><br/>What follows next is a psychological thriller where Mike's past is revealed, piece by piece. It begins quietly, but quickly spirals out of Mike's control and he finds himself trapped in his own subconsciousness. No matter what he does, things only get worse, and as the audience learn the real truth behind Mike Enslin, Mike himself completely loses his mind to a point where he's no longer able to distinguish reality from imagination.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of the room being a journey through Mike's personality. The way the story is revealed lets the audience learn piece by piece how he came to travel around the country looking for ghosts. The paranoia in the film is very credible, and the horror only adds to it. It's definitely one of the horror films which has a deeper story under it.<br/><br/>Even though the story is solid, I believe it progressed too fast, especially after Mike came into room 1408. The fact that it took a man who's visited nearly every haunted hotel room in the country a mere ten minutes or so to get that affected by room 1408 only proves that he himself is a hoax.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a true horror film with a story and character development.

Yet, the writers were able to adapt the minor amount of source material into a surprisingly effective PG-13 thriller. In the film, a disillusioned author who researches haunted locations for his book series decides to spend a night in the Dolphin Hotel's haunted room #1408, where fifty-six visitors had died of various strange circumstances. The film hits a few speed bumps but manages to be a thoroughly entertaining supernatural thriller.<br/><br/>It's seems to be a widely recognized notion that films based on the works of Stephen King are hit (THE GREEN MILE) or miss (DREAMCATCHER). 1408 is a hit; it's a thriller that doesn't rely on gore effects or slasher techniques to create tension. There are a handful of cheap ""boo"" moments but they aren't overused. The film stars John Cusack as Mike Enslin, the main character tormented by the room's evil, and the majority of the film is Cusack alone. Cusack's a great actor and, despite rarely having anyone to work off of other than his pocket recorder, does an awesome job. The film also boasts the ever-cool Samuel L. Jackson as Gerald Olin, the Dolphin's manager who does his best to warn Cusack to no avail.<br/><br/>The film starts strong and the first hour keeps the pace, baiting Cusack and the audience along with increasingly strange occurrences. Towards the end of the second act, the film grinds to a crawl with psych-out that goes on a bit too long and caused me to lose interest while I waited for the next big development in the story. Thankfully, it picks up in time for a decent conclusion (I personally prefer the theatrical ending over the director's cut). 1408 is entertaining spin on the usual ""haunted house"" motif and, despite it's PG-13 rating, delivers the tension and creep-outs to create a fun thriller."

","Story: This movie does a perfect build of creating anticipation in the mind of the audience, mainly through Jackson's constant warnings about room 1408. We're caught between saying, ""Don't go in there, stupid!"" and, ""But I'd really like to know what's in there, since it's been built up so well!"" Sometimes, Cusack's character comes across as a bit dense, but if he didn't then we wouldn't have a movie. B <br/><br/>Acting: John Cusack does a great job of portraying a man who has given up on his life and is simply living and writing for a paycheck. He then convincingly grows as a character without being cliché about it. Samuel L.Jackson is Samuel L. Jackson and awesome because of it.

In terms of quantity, there are very few scares in this movie, but those work and work well because of that atmosphere. A <br/><br/>Visuals: If the visuals hadn't worked, the direction would have failed in this movie. I think the best scene visually would have to be the scene of Cusack in the (SLIGHT SPOILER... BUT IT WAS IN THE TRAILER) snow filled room attempting to communicate with his wife through his laptop. The image is distorted and hard to make out when his avatar starts talking without his prompting, telling his wife to come to room 1408. The shot of his possessed avatar looking back at him though the LCD screen with a slight smirk on his shadowy face is probably one of the most effective visuals I've seen. A <br/><br/>Overall: I've read far too few Stephen King stories, something that I'm trying to rectify, but the most recent movies based on his stories have been absolute gold, and this one is near the top of the mountain along with The Mist.

","A climactic film which seemed to only get better and better and scarier and scarier as it went along. As soon as it finished it felt like a ride was over, this movie was very intense to watch, I couldn't look away for a second.<br/><br/>Definitely one of Stephen King's scariest short stories translated into a screenplay. The whole way through I could just imagine how the book would be, and how they thought to adapt it into a movie. However I do not think I have the guts to read the book!<br/><br/>This intense film is carried out pretty much inside room 1408, in the posh New York hotel named ""Dolphin"", following a small time writter of novels such as ""10 Most Haunted Hotels"" and ""10 Most Haunted Graveyards."" Which leaves the heavy burden on the acting skills of John Cusack and the writing of Stephen King. As mentioned, King executed the story immaculately, the character introductions are intriguing and not forgetting the great performance from Samual L. Jackson, who manages to set up the scenario impeccably. This film reminded me what a high quality actor John Cusack is, maybe the best I've seen him. I was told by my brother that he has this skill, he is just always given ""John Cusack"" roles. After watching the film I am definitely going to re-watch High Fidelity and also one of King's other scariest movies, the notorious It.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, it would seem only a certain number of events could occur in a hotel room. My friends, this could not be further from the truth. Despite expecting the next scare, it was always a surprise, and while one part of me was on the come down from the previous scare, it only seemed to get freakier. I found myself breathing heavily and thinking ""what else could possible happen? how can it get scarier than that??"" only to be thinking the same thought 15 minutes later after the next scene.<br/><br/>An excellently written story executed immaculately on the big screen. Highly recommended for a scary night in."

","On the surface you'll see mostly just jump-scares and a simple idea, but the highlight of the film is John Cusack's portrayal of Mike Enslin, the logical skeptic, losing his sanity and trying hopelessly to reason it out in his mind. It's really one of the more faithful adaptations of King's stories, compared to The Mist and other ones of late.<br/><br/>The special effects are used more tastefully than similar movies, where necessary for the most part. Those hoping to see lots of Samuel L Jackson will find he has little screen time. 90% of the acting in the film comes from Cusack, who expertly handles his character's attitude and weakness. He has a great sense of humor, but doesn't slip on the dramatic scenes.<br/><br/>1408 is a much more character-driven story than most horror movies of it's kind. As much as it's about everything that's happening to Enslin, it's about what's happening in him, and hopefully you'll be able to take notice and appreciate it's uniqueness. Stay scared."

","1408 is based on the chilling Stephen King novel, and it is a very suspenseful and well-made film. It is very psychological, as is the novel. The atmosphere is great. The art direction of the hotel is very nicely done. The direction is superb for a thriller like this, and John Cusack actually gives a superb performance. His portrayal of Mike Enslin is very realistic, and he is able to capture his character the way King wanted to in his novel. The film has some certain scares for sure, and some very creepy moments. The film does fade in its second half a bit, and I actually very much liked the director's cut ending more than the theatrical version's ending. I thought it was more fitting.

","Stephen King filmatisations rarely work, in fact I have enjoyed only maybe three of movies based on his works, at least from the ones I've seen. So that's why 1408 was such a pleasant surprise for me, as I really did like it and it didn't have the feeling of unnecessary dragging that most of the films based on King's novels have.<br/><br/>In it's core 1408 is pretty basic story of a tortured soul, writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack), who investigates and writes about ghost invested places of America. One day he checks into a hotel Dolphin, that has a room, that the director of the hotel, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), describes as one evil room. As usual Enslin doesn't believe a word that is said about the room, but soon enough he notices, that there indeed is something in there. Or then again it all might be in his head.<br/><br/>1408 is effective and well woven yarn, that mainly slips into the territory of supernatural drama than your standard generic slasher horror film."

","Wow. The first thing I must say is that I haven't been this much on the edge of my seat since I saw High Tension years ago. However the second thing I must say is I left the movie with a sense of dissatisfaction. The reason? The last quarter of the film.<br/><br/>From the time the spooky stuff started happening in this film I wanted it to reach the conclusion. Not because I wasn't enjoying it, but because I wanted to see how they were going to go about ending it. Not many movies leave themselves this many different roads to go down. Perhaps they had too many options because I feel they chose the wrong one. That being said it could've been worse also.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer who receives a hint about the mysterious room 1408 in the Dolphin hotel in New York. He plays him adequately, but never really makes you say ""wow"" about him. Samuel L. Jackson plays the hotel manager who heeds the warnings and does so very well indeed. He really sets the scene well for this supposedly terrifying room and has us unnerved before we've even seen what it's capable of for ourselves.<br/><br/>What makes the film so unsettling from here on out is the combination of well executed frights and the unknowing of what is going on due to the earlier mentioned many avenues the story could go down. Credit here must go to director Mikael Håfström and of course the master of storytelling Stephen King.<br/><br/>1408 mixes elements of terrifying horror, intriguing thrills and even a few touches of drama and the result is a very solid, entertaining film. All involved deserve much praise. A few have been put off seeing it in the first place by the seemingly unoriginal story of a haunted venue. This is a shame because rarely is the concept done this well and those people are really missing a treat."

","Review: movie is about a room in a hotel known for paranormal activity, room 1408. John Cusack investigates the room by staying in it. The room is controlled by a psychic angler team. What he experiences is all based in his mind even though it may appear the room is being physically changed by the events that unfold, so you will see him asleep part of the time after big events. The goal is to enable him to move into the next life by resolving personal issues from his past e.g. his dead daughter appears to him, but after he hugs her she crumbles to dust (like a corpse)  this is not real but is a role play by the psychic angler team. Other role plays involve his anger toward his Father. If all these issues are resolved to a sufficient level, the target-fish John Cusack can be killed  the method of choice being various forms of suicide. However, due to free will it's up to him whether he accepts this or not. He doesn't, so the cycle repeats itself - at which point he decides to take matters into his own hands. This film is based on a story by Steven King - in which he displays a total understanding of this subject matter."

","Despite being a big Stephen King fan I've yet to read the short story of this movie so I can't make any comparisons between the film and the story. Judging the movie on its own, it works brilliantly though it did take a while for the idea of John Cusack playing the character to wash over me during the first half an hour. However, he does later fit into the role naturally and makes a film which centres around one person in particular really interesting. A lot of the special effects were great and the 'window' scene was particularly well carried out. <br/><br/>The only major problem I had with the film was the end of the director's cut, to me it didn't make much sense.

He gets a postcard stating do not stay in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel. He decides the hotel would make a good chapter in his book, so elects to stay there. He has to get his publisher to threaten to sue the hotel in order to stay in the room. After arriving, he gets an earful from the hotel manager, Mr. Olin, as to why he should not stay in room 1408.

Spoilers.<br/><br/>Someone in one of the threads remarked about how the theatrical version was better than the director's cut ""for once."" Agreed.<br/><br/>Someone in yet another thread remarked that maybe he'd died in the original surfing accident.<br/><br/>Agreed. (Maybe. I saw this day before yesterday, missed the first few minutes completely, and had to catch the alternate ending later on.) Both basically say the same thing, but the theatrical version made it more creepy and ambiguous and to me, more appealing...lots of different little flow charts going on with that one. In this case, less shock = more ACTUAL terror.<br/><br/>(Anyone who thinks Cusack is not a GREAT actor after this and High Fidelity is just mad. Try carrying a film almost completely by yourself. He's a master at this.) Thirteen, thirteen, thirteen, everything adds up to thirteen! Must mean it's evil or bad luck.<br/><br/>No.<br/><br/>It's superstition and misdirection.<br/><br/>The real story is about illusion and reflection.<br/><br/>I'd had a question about how the room looked so retro-modern and updated when no one could or would go in there for more than a few minutes at a time without being in danger (was a sticky point for me, but--the engineer could have been part of the room, just as the receptionist ended up being, just as Olin may have been all along--food for thought).<br/><br/>Maybe people see the room the way they WANT to see it. ""I've been here before..."" You see what you WANT, but DON'T want... or NEED, but DON'T need... to see when you're in the room.<br/><br/>For a time during his ordeal, Enslin was in his own home, safe and sound, after a surfing accident.<br/><br/>""Whew! This was all a dream!"" But, the room is always with you.<br/><br/>It's your conscience; it's your most excruciating pain; it's your pathos; it's your love; it's your regret; it's your triumph; it's your disgrace; it's your greatest joy; it's your loneliness; it's your darkest fear; it's your wonderful relief; it's what you cannot change, but MUST accept; it's your life---it's your life that IS going to end at some point; it's your MIRROR.<br/><br/>It is the truth.<br/><br/>The room shows you YOURSELF. Maybe not even how you really are, but maybe how you perceive yourself to be, as it's all about images.<br/><br/>And that is why mirrors and mirror images are SO powerful in this film. It's why the very first unsettling thing we witness is the engraving on the cover of the bible (a symbol of any volume containing ""beliefs"") becoming a mirror image when he throws it back down into the drawer.<br/><br/>The room isn't hell.<br/><br/>The room isn't evil.<br/><br/>The room is a MIRROR.<br/><br/>A mirror of YOU.<br/><br/>And once you truly look into that mirror, you can't ever again deny what it is you saw looking back at you.<br/><br/>Scary stuff."

","This is a good horror movie, really good. It has a used kind of plot but the movie uses it in a very different frightening way. When Cusack first arrives at the hotel, only in the lobby you are starting to get bad vibes, because you know something bad is coming up. And when the hotel manager (Jackson) is starting to warn Cusack about staying in 1408, and telling him everything that has happened there, it only gets worse. I really felt that i didn't wanna see what happened when he went in there. I did NOT want Cusack to walk into that room. Now the really scary parts begin. But scary is good. 1408 delivers what it wants, a scary, mystical, psychological thriller with a really intense mood. Very different from other fast made mediocre horror movies, which seem to just come every single minute. Movies like 1408 is rare, also because of the actors. Good, talented actors stars in this movie. Its not many horror movies which stars this kind of actors. But i think that maybe this is because its a Steven King based movie. Then its not just an ordinary horror movie and draws different kind of thinking, actors and creators. A 8/10. Scary, tense, good acting and nice plot. See it."

","I guess it's quite common for people to say that they liked the book better than the movie. I'm afraid I have to agree, even though it wasn't even a book, but a short story. I read the story quite a while before the movie came out, and wasn't surprised they'd try to make a movie out of it. After all it was probably the scariest freaking short story I ever read. But this isn't a book review.<br/><br/>I must say that if you have already read the story, and are hoping for something as spooky as that, well I'd say your going to be let down. Don't get me wrong, they made a decent piece of cinema here, and I feel it's a better attempt at horror than you tend to get these days. There is a good feeling of suspense that they manage to build up throughout the movie, and the psychological effects of the movie are quite well done. It does manage to make you feel a small bit of the insanity that is occurring in the film. It doesn't however manage to pull off the affect to the level which a reader of the story would be expecting, it never really reaches that peak you are expecting. It doesn't keep a steady buildup of suspense, it allows the suspense to fall off at parts, and for this movie, I feel that was a serious error in judgement.<br/><br/>Of course I never really expected a movie to be able to capture the same feeling as the story, so I wasn't really surprised. It just didn't seem like the kind of story that could be transferred to film. I must say that they did do a better job than I expected them to do, though. So kudos for that. And I must say that Cusack did do a good job acting in the movie, though I felt that the part of the hotel manager, played well by Samuel L. Jackson, wasn't given the proper amount of depth, and I feel his main scene should have been given a little longer screen time.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, those of you who have read the story and are looking for something to live up to it, don't get your hopes to high. However, if you haven't read the story and don't know exactly what to be expecting, then it should be a really good watch for you. I feel that having too high a level of standards set for this movie is what probably made it fall short for me.<br/><br/>All in all a decent movie, but I feel that with the raw material they had to work with in the original short story, the script writers could have done a much better job."

","John Cusack plays an author whose specialty is debunking supposedly haunted locales. In this movie he tackles a hotel room, which he finds out really is, in the words of manager Sam Jackson, ""an evil f***ing room"". 1408 starts off on the right foot, using the skeptical Cusack as a surrogate for the viewer. And the writers and director do manage to create a few scary moments early on, but the movie is plagued by two main problems. First, the story is saddled with some heavy-handed ""lessons"". Second, and even more damaging, the movie is completely lacking in interior logic. The tricks the room deploys against Cusack are rather random, too often reliant on cheap shock value, and sometimes just plain laughable (It's too warm! It's too cold!! The sprinklers are going off!!! The mini-bar is empty! Oh, the horror!). And the way Cusack vanquishes the room is lame: he simply burns it down. Why would that even work on a supernatural room? Then we get the underwhelming final scene, when Cusack's ex-wife hears their dead daughter's voice on his tape recorder.<br/><br/>From what I've read, the director's cut at least has a better ending, with Cusack dying in the fire he sets. Jackson later sees an apparition that implies Cusack and his daughter are reunited."

","'Based' on a Stephen King short story, the premise of this movie is enough to send shivers of anticipation up and down the spine of any movie buff or horror fan. John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson share only a short amount of screen time together but even these electric few minutes serve to make the mouth water for the main course - the room! Unfortunately the movie relies on too many plot and character stereotypes to make it memorable after closing credits. The dishevelled protagonist with a tragic past is not only a staple of King's fiction but of other horror films (ie the Reaping). The wife and daughter have scarcely anything to work with, whilst Jackson's appearance is sadly too brief and he barely hits his stride before his scenes are over.<br/><br/>Once in the confines of 1408, what could have been a wonderful chillfest turns out to be a bizarre montage of events, some of which are downright creepy and some of which are downright idiotic. The scares come like clockwork - good scare, crap scare, good scare, crap scare... it starts off nicely with the creeps being subtle, building up the tension. As all hell breaks loose and the skeptical Cusack starts to lose it so does the plot. Cusack holds up his own but the room fails to deliver - except for the annoying receptionist on the end of the phone - pure gold! This could have been so much more and is made even more disappointing because the premise was so fantastic - it was a blank canvas waiting to be filled with horror - yet it appears as if the artist wasn't up to the task."

He comes up with Yet Another awesome performance. In fact this performance was according to me, His most awaited one. Samuel Jackson has hardly a role that doesn't last for more than 15 minutes. But Samuel still performed very well. The background score was a plus in this movie. It really scares you.<br/><br/>As i wrote earlier, I was a little hesitant by the film maker on this movie, But i am very glad to say that the Film Maker proved me wrong here.

Olins efforts to deter Enslin only spur him on so he allows him to book the room. He is warned that no one last more than an hour in the room.<br/><br/>After Enslin settles in the room his view on the supernatural radically changes after he initially thinks he is hallucinating on drug spiked alcohol.

","As grapefruits go, 1408 is right up there with The Shining, also inspired by a Stephen King work and featuring a menacing hotel and the wobbly sanity of a writer lodging there. ""It's an evil bleep-IN room!"" intones Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the smooth but vaguely sinister manager of the Dolphin Hotel. John Cusack is stellar as Mike Enslin, a cynical Everyschlub who writes ""occult travel guides,"" but believes in nothing, especially anything resembling an afterlife. What happens in room 1408 of the Dolphin may change Enslin forever--if he survives the first hour. The thrills range from jumpy ""gotcha"" moments involving mirror images, to more traditional horror fare like bleeding walls, to truly diabolical touches like the recurrence of the Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun."" (Shudder.) The film does a nice job of weaving the operatic horror effects with the truly heart-breaking back story of the death of Enslin's young daughter and his marriage--perhaps the only two things Enslin has ever believed in. And thankfully, there's just enough humor to leaven the intensity at key moments; Cusack is unparalleled when it comes to delivering a self-deprecating wisecrack, even as his life passes before his eyes. Get your adrenaline pumping and check into this room. Oh, and sorry, no refunds."

From the mere viewing of the trailer,you can tell that said novelist is about to have his mind forcibly changed.<br/><br/>An effective,if perhaps forced and puzzling,thriller that has much of the earmarks of a Stephen King tome,which makes sense since this is based off a short story by the horror master. Director Mikael Hafstrom is not shy about using physical special effects(As opposed to CGI) to make the terror as tangible as possible. The buffering support plot lines--Enslin's crumbled marriage to Lily(MAry McCormack),which was sped along by the terminal illness of their only child(Jasmine Jessica Anthony),and his broken relationship with his dad(Len Cariou)--does add depth to the story,but(and I hope to not give anything away here)doesn't give much satisfaction to the payoff. Also,the show(And perhaps this is the fault of the source material)gives SO much personality to the room(hence the summary line)that the side trips into Enslin's psyche seem to be little more than sacrificial offering for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>As said before,effective(read=creepy and scary to precision)but somewhat unsatisfying.

","This movie was exactly what I expected, not great, but also not that bad either. In my opinion PG13 movies aren't scary enough so that's why I already knew I was going to be bored throughout the entire film. Sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we all haven't already seen. I guess I didn't like it because I thought there were too many twists and turns happening; it got old and repetitive. I also didn't understand if all the things Cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not. There is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. The movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about. What I did like was the special effects. Other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it. Maybe its just me but I thought this was below average."

I can't wait to see Bag of Bones, read the book like 4 times already and will keep rereading like I have with The Stand and It and Dolores Claiborne and pretty much all the books I do own.

","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a eye-witness writer of paranormal ghost survival guides, his stories which have been held in high acclaim by his fans, and an individual who at one point went to supposedly haunted hotels for the stimulation of perhaps finding his elusive subject, but as time went on, his faith began to diminish. He created many stories from his imagination rather then personal experiences, and feels that his readers deserve the truth about it. Suffice to say that he is not going to be rattled by the ghastly Dolphin Hotel. The film opens where the short story (by Stephen King, who else?) doesn't, Enslin is going to a hotel that has apparent haunted history, but after a night of discovery and interminable periods of waiting, our protagonist's theory about the non-existent afterlife is only strengthened by this. To establish themes, properly and proficiently the beginning moves by quick, only because the buff of the film takes place in the hotel room, but we are also shown a day in the life of Enslin, including a book signing where he explains to the three fans that show'd up, that his work is not exactly cut out for him. Instead he is forced to create chilling plots and twists so the book isn't like the real experience he had. The Dolphin Hotel caught his eye, and he felt would make a solid final chapter for his book, so, even against the grave warnings attempted by hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), he goes on one of his usual adventures expecting the same result as every other desperate hotel makes to attract attention. Too bad for Mike, this room is actually haunted. As the night proceeds, the subtle creeks and cracks in the distance evolve to be the evil room Olin warned him of. Enslin's past is revealed and we see the selfish writer just happens to have been given a taste of his own medicine so-to-speak. In my opinion, the screenplay for this film is truly one that deserved an Oscar-nomination. It truly did. The complicated character and a night of very psychological, moral and self discovery lacked very little. Good direction and performances hold my opinion."

","Steven King has long been a favorite author of mine and 1408 is just another basic example of his work. I quite liked this movie adaptation but I have yet to read the original story. While the movie is not particularly scary, it certainly has a creepiness all its own. There a few twists and turns including one very big andshall I say, misleading, one in the latter half of the film. My main concern with this movie on the other hand, is that it includes a lot of back-story and other plot elements that don't seem to flesh out or get explained at all by the end of the film.<br/><br/>1408's acting isn't really much to talk about but it is quite good nonetheless. John Cusack's character is a rather typical caricature of the cynical man who ""believes in nothing but himself"" and has a dry sarcastic comment for everything. The movie spends the largest amount of its time around Mike Enslin for obvious reasons. I haven't really seen him act in much else but he certainly does a good job in this movie especially since he was forced to act by himself and respond terrified to nothing. Samuel Jackson acts pretty much the same as he does in most of his movies but with significantly less yelling. The first exchange between the two characters in particular is a fine display of their acting talent.<br/><br/>All together, 1408 is entertaining enough that a second view can be just as enjoyable as the first even after all the twists have been exposed. Eventually I'd like to see more Steven King adaptations but for now this is one of my favorites (second to Secret Window). If you enjoy a creepy but fun film or are a big Steven King fan than I certainly recommend this film."

"pninson","4","0","0","15 December 2007"," Clichéd, but watchable
","Stephen King has cranked out so many stories in the last 35 years that he long ago ceased coming up with any original ideas. His stories repeat and recycle the same ideas and concepts endlessly, and this film is certainly no exception.<br/><br/>Of course, King is not to blame for this by-the-numbers, clichéd script, which just barely manages to be watchable, but there's nothing here you haven't seen before. King's Overlook Hotel, in his breakthrough novel ""The Shining"", was the same contrivance, but far more effective. There wasn't a single scene or idea in ""1408"" that I haven't seen in another horror film, usually more than once. The story fails to build suspense; it's just a series of run-of-the-mill horror set pieces --- blood dripping from walls, radios and TVs turning themselves on (and continuing to run when unplugged) --- ghosts flitting across the room, etc. etc.<br/><br/>The production design is handsome enough, and John Cusack's performance rescues the film from being a complete embarrassment. Since he's by himself for at least half the film's running time, he has to carry the picture, and this is no small accomplishment. A less talented actor might well have fallen short. Samuel L. Jackson does as much as can be expected in a very small role.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's standard fare for horror fans. I seriously thought about turning it off about halfway through, but I managed to stick it out till the end.<br/><br/>Hopefully, it's not giving away too much to say I was mildly surprised by the ending. That's something."

I've never been able to properly express myself in this climate"" which was uttered by Hunter S. Thompson / Duke in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Was the director a fan, perhaps?

"cyberpixl","10","0","0","4 December 2007"," Excellent movie
","Anyone who like psychological thrillers should definitely see 1408. It is the best movie ever to reproduce effects of a delirium. It shows the horror and disorientation that a person can experience while being under influence of a mind altering substance. The state of mind where you no longer can distinguish what's real and what isn't. The story does not mention any mind altering substances though, and just models the whole experience as a horrible dream.<br/><br/>Though a little exaggerated, the experiences that Mike Enslin was going through could very well be experienced while on influence of psychedelic drugs. This movie shows what a bad trip can be like and gives the insight into the minds of people that commit suicides while on drugs. People who are not ready at all for the effects that await them. People not ready to turn their mind inside out and who just think it's all fun and games. I think Stephen King did a great job at describing his own psychedelic experiences and he also wrapped it all up into an innocent horror movie package so that only certain kind of people can really see whats deep inside. General public on the other hand just sees the outside and wanders how somebody could come up with such a genuine idea.<br/><br/>This was one of the best movies I have ever seen :)"

","John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson star in this adaptation of Stephen King's short story 1408, the story of a skeptic writer who spend the night in a hotel room which turns out to be an authentic source of unbridled evil. Mike Enslin (Cusack) has been writing about ghosts for a long time now but seriously doubts ever coming into contact with one. So when he receives a postcard warning him about a haunted room in the Dolphin Hotel, Enslin jumps at the chance. After the hotel owner's prophetic speeches on the room's danger, Enslin accepts the challenge. After a few minutes in the hotel room, Enslin resigns himself to believing that all the stories were hocus pocus. But when the clock radio begins playing We've Only Just Begun by the Carpenters untouched, thus begins one skeptic man's journey in the abyss of the unexplained. John Cusack gives a wonderful, authentic performance as Enslin, slowly making us care about his character and Samuel L. Jackson, although his screen time is ultimately limited, is a deadpan delight in an underplayed but effective performance. It has been said that PG-13 is one of the worst things to happen to the horror genre, and that's probably true, but this is one of those rare exceptions. The film pulls you in and freezes you in place as the evil unravels before your very eyes."

","40 min left to the end, I was slightly scared and pretty tensed and pleased by the movie. I was even comparing it with ""the shining"". of course the fact that both stories happened inside a hotel(room) helped a bit too. <br/><br/>But let's go back to 1408. It was mostly a 1-man's movie. I'd say the director made a pretty smart decision choosing John Cusack for the main character Mike. His performance was so persuading and vivid that I felt every mind changing and all the piled up fears. <br/><br/>30 min left to the end. The whole terrifying experience of Mike turned out to be a ""dream"" he had during his comma caused by the hit on the head of his surfing board. I couldn't be more disappointed.

So Hollywood!<br/><br/>Oh, my heart pounded once more when the hotel manager (by Samuel Jackson) was listening to the tape inside his car. Good old little trick.<br/><br/>I wasn't really happy that it didn't give an clear answer to why all these happened. But then it's just a movie, which already served its purpose to entertain me.

","This movie was as surprise from start to finish. I was not highly anticipating a work based on Stephen King, and adapted by Larry Karaszewski, whose dubious ""credits"" seem to lie flat on the page, as well as the screen. King's works are bastardized enough. I really saw no point to this new exercise in adulteration.<br/><br/>I can say I am happy a fan brought me a copy of the DVD. I was bowled over. The innovatives were quite creative, and the work itself held a great fascination beneath the seeming infectious insanity if a house gone mad.<br/><br/>I might find this an opportune time to interject that I may not have bought the execution of this work, without the beautifully tragic performance of John Cusak. He was this film's Jack Nicholson, and he pulled it off brilliantly.<br/><br/>All in all? Stephen King likes a haunted house, and quite frankly, I highly enjoy haunted houses via King. 1408 is like the Shining on a steroid overdrive, and I highly recommend it.

But once i saw it yesterday, i totally changed my mind and i'd completely classify it into the horror genre without any doubts.<br/><br/>John Cusack's magnificent and outstanding appearance have presented the character Mike Enslin beautifully that i cant suggest any other actor for that role.He introduces Mike as the father who lost his daughter and left his wife, and he became a man that specializes in abnormal phenomenas as well as writing books. What John Cusacks also brings to the character is that Mike doesn't fear anything since he doesn't believe in anything,which assures the viewers and makes them comfy. The manager of the hotel Mr.Gerald Olin (Samuel L.

The director Mikael Håfström has done his part when it came to bringing the pieces of this movie together as well as reaching the point to scare the audience through a new technique, and also a nice sophisticated ending.<br/><br/>1408 is a genuine masterpiece that i'd recommend to any horror movie fan. 10/10"

","Despite a promising cast, (John Cusack, Samuel L Jackson) the latest Stephen King adaption 1408 is a big disappointment. Sceptical ghost hunting author Michael Enslin (Cusack) blithely checks into the infamous NY hotel room, after strenuous efforts by the manager (Jackson) to dissuade him, primarily on the basis of 1408's frightening history: multiple deaths during its previous occupancies, a series of fatalities which include leapers from the high window, suicides, self-mutilators as well as many others not officially counted as they are from alleged 'natural causes'. Spending a whole night in a room or venue supposedly haunted is Cusack's modus operandi when researching his books on the subject. Jackson assures him that sticking more than an hour in 1408 will be a real something in itself...<br/><br/>Resolutely lacking much in the way of real suspense, instead substituting a couple of full colour ghosts, manufactured shocks, including the usual blood leaking out of wall cracks, claustrophobic chase scenes, bricked up windows, fluctuating temperature schemes, a couple of awkward dream sequences, as well as being interspersed with a maudlin supporting plot based around Enslin's grief over his dead child (which plays an important part of the climax) 1408 is very much the haunted hotel room by numbers, utilising a over stretched dramatic structure which ultimately seems less a genuinely effective device than a way of making a predictable series of events more interesting.<br/><br/>Acting alone on screen while reacting to this host of paranormal blather a lot of the time, the normally dependable Cusack does his best but, as the duly anticipated shock moments come and go more or less on cue, the whole thing remains unmemorable and just drags on too long. The initially highly rational Enslin also gets rattled much too quickly for this viewers taste, and remains rattled for too long without much self examination or investigation of his fears. (an interesting conspiracy theory concerning the hotel staff is played down) . Ironically, if the famous haunted room had been one placed in a sterile, modern hotel, it would had been much more frightening - neatly exemplifying Enslin's line about ""the blandness of evil"". As it is, amidst the Gothic, dark panelled veneers of the The Dolphin nothing is really more than we expect.<br/><br/>Jackson looks slightly out of place as a posh hotelier with just one or two major scenes to steal, and this reviewer for one will turn to SNAKES ON A PLANE again before this out of his recent appearances for most pleasure, a film which certainly had more entertaining, and better paced, scares than the largely po-faced 1408 mostly lacks. For a more interesting and heck, just plain fun version of the-author-facing-the-dark-forces thread in film I recommend Carpenter's decade old MOUTH OF MADNESS way over this, as at least it successfully suggests the disorientation and mounting distress of those literary doubters who stumble across, or provoke, evil forces."

Everything started with ""The Shining"" and then continued with ""Secret Window"" after all these years. My interest for King's books is very high and everything I read so far is good. I have to also admit that I've never read ""1408"" but I certainly will one day.<br/><br/>To me sometimes is better to watch a movie and then read a book, because you don't know how everything is going to end. That's why I liked ""1408"" and it has this King's genius touch. Only he can think of story like this.<br/><br/>The story is about writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack), who is writing about supernatural things, and and he receives a postcard with the hotel name and the number of the room. Enslin wants to go into that room although he read about all those people who died and also hotel manager Mr. Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) begs him not to do that. But Enslin is determined to go anyway. <br/><br/>This movie starts excellent, fast and gripping with lots of information to viewers. But in the middle gets a little lost but it repays at the end. Ah, that ending. Left me with so much questions. Was everything that happened to Enslin real? Yes it is. He has conversation with his dead daughter on tape. Is this possible? In King's world yes it is. But what is he trying to say with that ending? How I understood he wanted to say that there is connection with this world and world after death. That connection is only possible in room 1408 because Enslin managed to hold and talk to his dead daughter. But why did all those people died in this room and Enslin stayed alive? Again my explanation is that all other people were weak and they cracked, but Enslin says in one scene something like I will stay alive or if I'm going down I'm taking you (room) with me - when he starts fire. Enslin realized that he has to fight if he wants to stay alive, he didn't gave up although he could (that scene when there are ropes in the room so he can hang himself). But what is really brilliant is King's mind. He started from thing that is so basic - that all hotel rooms are creepy places: ""... Just think, how many people have slept in that bed before you? How many of them were sick? How many... died?"". <br/><br/>So briefly, ""1408"" is gripping horror-thriller that will keep your attention right till the end. Swed Håfström made very good adaptation of King's story and I also liked Cusack in this role. You will definitely think throughout and probably be scared in some scenes. I highly recommend this movie to all King's fans and to all others who never read any of his books. Just watch it and then write a comment how you understood this title."

But then, a series of events starts, and we see that the movie definitively began.<br/><br/>For most of the first half of the movie, you can see some mildly scary scenes. None of them are incredibly original, but they do an honest job bringing some tension to your room.<br/><br/>But at about the second half of the movie, it all goes down the drain. Everything you see is total non-sense. Scenes with no connection at all between one another. You begin to think that the authors had a few good ideas for initial 60 minutes, but simply couldn't figure out what to do for the rest of the movie. So they started to throw things that couldn't scare an eight years old.<br/><br/>Then, by the end of the movie, you get that awful plot turns that makes if you think: ""man, what are they trying to save here? just pack things up and leave with the rest of your dignity"".<br/><br/>The movie ends and you don't know what Samuel's roll really was, or if the room was evil or Cusack's character was just plain insane."

Samuel L. Jackson plays the hotel's manager, who recites the room's history of murder and suicide. Almost immediately after Mike checks in to 1408, strange things happen: The room becomes unbearably hot, then unbearably cold, Mike sees visions of the room's previous tenant-victims, and the radio won't stop playing the Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun.""<br/><br/>Cusack, an underrated actor who is usually better than his roles, does an admirable job as a tortured writer with a tragic past.

","1408 is about a trashy paranormal author (John Cusack: Better off Dead, American Sweathearts) who travels to globe to debunk haunted hotels, and other paranormal areas of interest. Maybe he finds an authentic place, but his personality tells us he has seen all the tricks. That is until he stays an hour in the famous room 1408 at the Dolphin in New York. Told the room is evil by the ever fun Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Snakes on a Plane) who plays the hotel manager our protagonist enters the room against the manager's wishes. What happens next is a series of rather effective and eerie images which John Cusack gives a very intense and provocative performance.<br/><br/>The movie's failure is its direction. The movie ends around 80 minutes but a quick time check will tell you, you still have 30 minutes to go. Right here would have been a good time to stop but the movie goes on and ends again. The idea the 1408 could be a room for Purgatory is quite effective, and could explain the hellish images. However the movie moves into another direction that just throws out the baby with the bathwater. In many ways the direction of the first 80 minutes is lost and we are left to believe the room is just torturing our protagonist. I found that to be a rather disappointing direction for the movie."

There are times when this movie goes through some unexpected premonitions that kind of mess with the flow of the movie but offers some back story to the main character giving him substance. The supernatural events that take place are classically done in the fashion of Poltergeist.

","This was a great movie. I was a little wary about watching it, seeing as how it's from a Stephen King story. I like to read Stephen King, but to watch? Not so much. Anyway, John Cusack was great. He had to handle most of the movie by himself, with very little human interaction for his character. The supporting characters didn't have much to do, but my personal favorites out of all of them were the ghosts. Be aware that things do tend to get a little silly toward the end. I know the big emotional scenes were supposed to be the ones with his dead daughter, but I found the scene in the bathroom, with his father in the wheelchair, to be strangely compelling, and that's one I have trouble getting out of my head. Typical Stephen King fare-the man is a writer for the people. He knows what we want, and he gives it to us in his great books. Without a lot of dithering, he delivers stories to keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie is the cinematic equivalent of that. Definitely recommended for a scare on a freezing autumn night."

","I watched a couple of movies last night. The first was the sequel to ""28 Days Later,"" ""28 Weeks Later."" I was severely disappointed, as the original was really good.<br/><br/>I went out, attempting to satisfy my ""scare tooth"" and picked up ""1408"" albeit hesitantly because the Blockbuster guy told me it wasn't that good. Boy was he wrong!<br/><br/>First off, Cusak is one of the greatest, underrated actors alive, and plays the role of Mike Eslin to a T. So much so that the viewer can't discern from Cusak and the character he plays, i.e. ""Identity."" Perhaps it shows how much an actor is willing to lose themselves in the role.<br/><br/>The build-up to room 1408 is masterfully created by Jackson's character with staunch and blatant resistance that heightens the appeal, anticipation and trepidation of the room.<br/><br/>The use of the Carpenter's ""We've Only Just Begun"" and the entrance of its creepy usage with volume is brilliant, and excites several times after the initial playing, I still have it going through my head.<br/><br/>The customized haunt of the room to Cusak's character's past is also very brilliantly done. The room shows him his fears he long forgot in the process of chasing ghosts, with beautiful symbolism of how his life had become chasing other's ghosts to avoid the impending presence of his own.<br/><br/>The paintings on the walls, the lighting, the carpet and wallpaper and bathroom design is all reminiscent of ""The Shining,"" yet also unique to its own story.<br/><br/>The fact that the whole floor that the room was on in the hotel is closed off adds to the intensity of the scare.<br/><br/>And in the end, don't read this if you have not seen it yet and are planning on, his ability to complete his relationship with his daughter and let go of the guilt and pain brought the film to an unexpected turn.<br/><br/>Favorites: The eerie woman's voice at the front desk. Cusak's character's progressive interaction with the room. Of course, ""We've Only Just Begun."" The resetting of the room, i.e. chocolates on the bed, folding of towels and toilet paper he used, etc.<br/><br/>There was a lot in this movie that categorizes it as very classy.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the fact that Cusak had a lot of ""alone"" on screen time that allowed him to really relate and interact with the room.<br/><br/>Well done!"

You really get drawn into the movie.<br/><br/>This movie isn't all that violent or bloody; instead the horror is psychological.

This is the good Stephen King type of horror.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>I liked how they showed Mike Enslin prior to showing up at the Dolphin Hotel. The short story only alludes to Mike's other travels. I felt that it really built the character up well. <br/><br/>I did feel that the scary parts of the film were all compacted in the middle. I also wasn't fooled by the ""it was just a dream"" sequence though they made that part longer than one expected in an attempt to fool you, it was just too obvious to me. <br/><br/>I seem to remember that in the short story, there is more detail about the deaths in the room. I would have liked to seen more ""ghosts"" or images as well as the back stories for the victims. Especially the guy with the hammer who periodically came after Mike. Though I suppose the director left that up for the individual viewer to play with in the mind.<br/><br/>I was a little surprised that Stephen King didn't have a cameo anywhere or maybe I missed it and no one else caught it either.

Enslin does his research and he finds there's strange local legends about that room, including murders and suicides. Enslin finds out that the room 1408 is off-limits in the Hotel. He convinces the hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) to let him stay in the room for the night. While Olin tries his best to not let Enslin stay in that room. Which Olin mentions other incidents that the newspaper didn't write about. But Enslin makes up his mind to stay in that infamous room and Olin says that no one survives after a certain time limit in that room. Once Enslin is in the room, he is amazed how normal that room is until very slowly strange things are starting to happen around him. Not everything makes sense in that room, when parts of his life are starting to haunt him. Now Enslin has to battle his own personal demons of his past to stay alive.<br/><br/>Directed by Mikael Hafstorm (Derailed) made an interesting, visually stylish supernatural ghost story about an evil room. Cusack is the whole show in the movie and he plays his part extremely well. Jackson is good in his small but memorable part as the Hotel Manager. This movie has some good scares and it is surprisingly intense as well. But after the strong 2/3 of the movie. Somewhere in the beginning of the last act nearly falls apart before finishing the film with an satisfying conclusion. But for some tastes, it is never as satisfying as you liked to be.

This review is the PG-13 Version of the movie. DVD only has two mini-featurettes and the original theatrical trailer. The Two Disc Collector's Edition have both the original theatrical cut and director's cut as well with an different darker conclusion. This fascinating premise is based on the short story by Stephen King (The Green Mile, Misery, The Mist). Which this film will certainly remind you of previous films of King's work on films. The picture was well received by the critics and it turned out to be a surprise box office success. Die Hard fans of King's work and for those, who like supernatural stories will probably enjoy this movie best. ""1408"" is an ambitious, suspenseful, well made movie that is certainly worth a look.

Its OK, don't get me wrong - but there its the same set pieces he's used before: old infirmed relative, dead sibling, haunted car/room/book etc etc...<br/><br/>There are scenes that are interesting and Cusack is his usual typecast self as a miserable, self-obsessed, voice over man. It works but only because its a tried and tested formula.<br/><br/>There are the almost cringe worthy ""horror"" moments, you know the ones: mirrors with dodgy reflections, phones calls that speak directly to the situation, lots of reaching on tiptoes only to loose balance and keep you on the ""edge of your seat"" etc etc.<br/><br/>This is a fairly enjoyable movie that falls into the ""worth watching once"" category.

I thought this movie was in the bad to awful range. There were no shocking moments (no ""shocking"" moments that weren't pathetically predictable, that is). I got the idea that electronics don't work in 1408 but, like another commenter mentioned, he is able to use wireless internet. but, don't worry, the internet goes down/gets too shaky/something to make communication complicated (i saw it in theaters awhile ago), which makes the fact that he was able to use it to begin with COMPLETELY realistic. The ending was an average one which was not effective in its attempt to pull up the rest of the below average storyline.

","""1408"" is probably the weirdest Stephen King adaptation so far. Weird in that you can't really say that it was a bad movie, but it wasn't completely satisfying, either. In its best moments ""1408"" seems like a mini-""Shining"" with all the claustrophobic paranoia of a hotel setting. Just like ""The Shining"" this movie works best when normal things like formal voices on the telephone or happy pop songs on the radio all of a sudden become more and more absurd as the main character descends into madness.<br/><br/>The direction in ""1408"" is good, too, sometimes reminiscent of classic haunted house movies. By filming certain scenes from weird angles director Hafstrom adds to the story's surrealism.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he makes some pretty painful mistakes, too. The original King-short story was effectively creepy. It was also too short to make for a 90 minutes motion picture, so in order to make it longer the screenwriters had to add a backstory. And what do you do in such cases when you need to stretch out a character's backstory? That's right, you add a dead kid, a divorced wife and a bad father/son-relationship. Everything that's completely by the numbers and doesn't really fit into the story. What's worse is that the backstory is conveyed very clumsily through numerous dream-like sequences that slow the movie down too much and aren't as dramatic or touching as they are supposed to be.<br/><br/>Apart from that, there are a few fine, creepy moments, but mostly we have nothing to be afraid of in ""1408"". A lot of ghosts move through the room, none of which are very interesting. We witness walls bleed (never seen that before, huh?) and portraits change. The latter was one of my favorite moments in the short story. On screen it didn't look as scary as I hoped it would. What bothered me most, though, was the changed ending all the way to a tacked on, final ""shock moment"" which was anything but cheesy and out of place.<br/><br/>Last but not least Cusack's performance isn't one of the glory moments in his career. He is left alone by himself for almost the entire movie and he's not awful or anything, but at the end of the day he's just John Cusack locked up in a room for one hour and a half.<br/><br/>""1408"" is really an odd movie. I can't believe that a story like this was made the way it has been made in 2007, but people seemed to like it and that's great. This is at the very least an original film in a genre that has become too formulaic in the past ten years, so even if it isn't entirely successful it's still very refreshing to see a horror movie that's different for a change."

The scene where he tries to capture the attention of someone in the opposite building across the road, and the air duct scene are other highlights. <br/><br/>The pace kinda of slows after the hour mark, and I was disappointed with the ending, but that was only because everything before was so good.

"petit76","8","0","0","1 October 2007"," nice premise ,cool pull off
","While doing some research before reviewing 1408, I was shocked to discover that this was the first time since 2004's Riding the Bullet that a film based on a Stephen King story had gotten the big screen treatment. 1408 marks somewhat of a comeback to the silver screen for the author after mainly working with television the past couple years. Director Mikael Hafstrom has created the most atmospheric and downright tense thriller I can think of so far this year. The premise may be thin, and yeah, it doesn't always make a lot of sense. But, is it ever effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) used to be a promising author until the untimely death of his young daughter, Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony). He now spends his time writing trashy paranormal novels about the world's most haunted areas. He travels the world, doing research by staying overnight at places that are supposed to be haunted, gets some colorful background info that he can use for material, and then moves on to his next job. One day, Mike receives a postcard informing him of an old hotel in New York City called the Dolphin Hotel, which is supposed to have a room that has quite the history. Doing some private research, he learns that the Dolphin has had a long and tragic history of deaths, all of them surrounding the guests that have stayed in Room 1408. Mike books the room, despite the warnings of the hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L.Jackson). Entering the room, nothing seems ominous at first. But then, the room itself begins to take on a life of its own, and begins tormenting Mike with various ghostly apparitions, mind tricks, and even displaying his own painful past before him in various ways.<br/><br/>1408 is the second thriller set around a hotel released in less than two months (the other being April's Vacancy), and is by far the superior film. The film is actually quite subtle in its way of creeping us out and disturbing us, which is a nice change of pace from the recent Hostel: Part II. Rather than bombard the audience with ghostly special effects and gore, the movie gets under your skin and goes for a much more psychological approach. The screenplay by Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski, wisely does not even attempt to explain Room 1408. It's just a very evil presence that can somehow look deep within troubled souls, and torture them to death with their own personal demons. In the wrong hands, this material could have been laughable. Even though the movie frequently flies into the realm of the unbelievable, it manages to somehow stay grounded.<br/><br/>A lot of this has to do with the fact that the film never loses its way, and become an excuse to throw as many special effects and jump scares into the movie as it possibly can. The human element of Mike Enslin is always at the center of the story itself, and its scares. The movie is built around the fact that he is forced to face his personal demons the longer he stays in his room, as well as try to keep his mind in check as various nightmarish hallucinations are paraded before him. It's much more effective than the usual characters that have passed as villains in recent paranormal films (usually gray-skinned people with hair over their faces), and it never once becomes heavy-handed or preachy. This is also a tricky balance to pull off. When the room started showing him flashbacks of Mike's own past, I grew nervous, thinking that the movie was going to start hitting us over the head with morales. Fortunately, it never once loses its sense of the eerie, and remains appropriately unsettling throughout.<br/><br/>At the center of the movie is John Cusack, who literally has to carry the movie almost by himself. This is essentially a one-man show for most of its running time, with fleeting apparitions being his main companions. Cusack has long been a favorite of mine, and this is one of his stronger recent roles. He not only has to carry almost the entire film on his own, but he also has to convincingly act like he is slowly going insane without hamming it up, or losing his personality. Any actor can tell you that madness is a difficult thing to depict. He strikes a very good balance, and remains believable throughout. Samuel L. Jackson is also notable in his small, but no less important, role as the manager who tries to talk Mike out of his decision to stay in the room. And then, of course, there is Room 1408, which is a character itself. The way it is constantly changing itself, right down to the paintings on the wall, creates an effectively creepy atmosphere that is continuously bizarre, but never so much so that we lose our sense to believe.<br/><br/>1408 succeeds where so many other films have failed in that it is not about apparitions jumping out at the actors or lurking in dark shadows. It digs much deeper for its horror than simple jolt thrills, and becomes an effectively thrilling horror film. It could be argued that the whole thing loses some weight when we apply logic to the story. But seriously, who wants to apply logic to a movie about an evil hotel room that can read your mind? When all is said and done, 1408 is a reminder of what horror can do. It can do so much more than thrill us. It can also make us laugh and leave us captivated. Perhaps what's more surprising than the fact that the movie can accomplish all that is that so few other horror films can. Evren Buyruk from California"

For me, it is a convincing tour-de-force acting performance. He really gets into the skin of his character and rides the storyline all the way through the roller coaster from hell, from its benign beginning to its heart-stopping twists and turns, up to its fiery end. He plays Mike Enslin, a writer who debunks popular haunted places. He gets challenged to stay at Rm. 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in New York City by an anonymous postcard. He couldn't resist the dare, so he thwarted all efforts to stop him from staying for a night. Needless to say, his life turns 360 degrees after the manager leaves him in the fated room. The evil spirit of the room, along with ghosts of the room's past victims, as well as Enslin's own personal ghosts regarding his daughter who died of cancer, all join forces to torment him and torture him both physically, mentally and emotionally.<br/><br/>After this movie, you will never hear ""We've Only Just Begun"" by the Carpenters the same way again. This sweet song actually became creepy! The movie never loses focus. Very exciting. Tight, very well-edited. There's a strange bit at the end with Samuel L. Jackson's hotel manager character in a perplexing scene. But then the whole movie is one big perplexing trip, you don't really notice."

","John Cusack plays a paranormal investigator tired of having to visit the fakes and hoaxes and who is cynical about new invitations to 'real' haunted places. He is intrigued by the stories of a haunted hotel room in the Dolphin in New York and decides to investigate.<br/><br/>So far, the plot moves along nicely his return to the city where he used to live with his now ex and now deceased daughter opens up a lot of possibilities in the plot. Unfortunately this is hardly addressed outside of the hotel room, making the subject somewhat forced once it does come into play. Still, Cusack plays the grieving father quite well in my opinion.<br/><br/>*spoilers ahead* Samuel L. Jackson is only in the way of the story. Cusack's publisher says the hotel manager cannot legally refuse him the room, but Cusack never has to use this option. Manager Jackson refused anyone to use the room for several years, yet Cusack talks him into in under five minutes.<br/><br/>From the moment Cusack's character enters the room, his credibility starts to disappear. Every second longer that he lasts, he becomes less coherent. He hints at hallucinogens in his drink or food, but this is never confirmed, making his behavior unrealistic, especially for the cynic he supposedly is.<br/><br/>This is what happens throughout the movie: A lot of elements are introduced and some are used once or twice, but so many of them are then left for new ones, as if the script cannot choose any one in particular. The plot tumbles from one disconnected element into the other and since many are both predictable and not scary, it never really builds up towards anything.<br/><br/>For such a long movie, this could have been so much more. The story seems incomplete and rather dull, especially compared to the trailer.<br/><br/>6 out of 10, for its unused potential and for Cusack's good acting almost making his character believable."
"Seagalogist","9","0","0","11 September 2007"," A great balanced traditional horror movie
","It has been a while since a movie such as 1408 has graced our screens. Firstly, this is not a gore fest. Actually I can hardly remember any blood in the movie let alone full on gore. The story is well written(as we have come to expect from King). It is putting King's work on the screen and doing his work justice. For me, this is the best transition of A king novel since The Shining or Misery. in fact, the story sort of gave me the impression that this is what would have happened if Jack, The main character from the Shining, had gone into that room! Cusack is perfectly cast as the non-believer with a lot of emotional baggage to boot. He has great comic timing, to ease the almost tense nature of the film. The balance between old fashioned in-your-face scares and more thought provoking scares is great. The downfall of this movie is the final 10-15 minutes. If you can bypass that, then you will find this movie enjoyable i suspect. It is a MUST for horror fans, and I would say for general audiences, this is a summer movie you should see before it sneaks past. It may not be the biggest blockbuster, but I found it one of the best movies this summer and the best horror this year. 9/10"

","My friends stared at me dumbstruck when I told them that I consider 1408 as a black comedy rather than a horror flick. '' Dude, did we just watch the same movie? '' one of them exclaimed with an ironic look on his face.<br/><br/>It starts of with the introduction of Mike Enslin ( John Cusack ), a traumatized writer that lost all faith in God and the supernatural after the death of his child. He spends his days trying to uncover paranormal occurrences as a lie by writing guides on the paranormal. A twisted leap of faith brings him in contact with the ''haunted'' room 1408, that is said to have a way to make its inhabitants kill itself in less than an hour. Manager Olin ( a short, not quite memorable role by Samuel L. Jackson ) does everything in his power to stop Enslin from going to this room. But,as you might have guessed, he fails and Enslin does go. From that point on the story unfolds as a roller-coaster of nightmarish situations for our cynical protagonist.<br/><br/>The thing with 1408 is that it's not that scary. Or,to be precise, its premise is scary but the outcome certainly isn't. But that doesn't make it an unpleasant movie. On the contrary. I really enjoyed the sadistic battle between Enslin and the horrible nightmares that ''room 1408 '' forces upon him. The room has the fiendishly power to be one step ahead of Enslin. Every attempt to escape culminates into more awkward situations. Not frightening, but cynical on a funny way. To give an example: at a certain point Enslin finds out that there is someone on the opposite of the hotel. He waves, trying to get attention, and discovers that this person is actually mimicking his every move. It is himself that he's seeing, and not some person that can come to his rescue. And than suddenly this mirrored version of himself is attacked by a screaming weirdo with a knife. He turns around, and...yeah, he's also being attacked. And this is just one example of the many tortures that will occur during the rest of the film."
"Muldwych","6","0","0","10 September 2007"," Entertaining and well acted, but unoriginal.
","In '1408', horror veteran Stephen King revisits elements of his early classic 'The Shining', by basically asking ""What would it actually be like to stay in Room 217? The result is naturally a battle of wits between whatever truly lurks in there, and the visitor's own mind. While it is definitely one of the better US horror offerings of late, I found '1408' to be largely derivative, partly from King's own work, but also of other horror films past.<br/><br/>I tend to think the ideal viewer for this isn't someone who's seen a lot of horror films, because with every scare on offer, I found each one bringing me back to a film, a King novel, or even certain computer games where I'd seen them before. Every step along the way, I felt ground being re-tread. It's inevitable that someone as prolific as Stephen King would end up retreading old ground, and it's certainly unintentional. Naturally, the Hollywood budget ensured that every chill and thrill was nicely realised, but it didn't stop the ending being easy to predict.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, '1408' was a good attempt to move away from the mindless gorefests that typify so many American horror films. That automatically elevates it by a level. Then there's the always-excellent John Cusack who turns in a very convincing performance as the sceptical paranormal investigator/writer who takes the challenge no-one else would. On balance, I think he's the main reason I'll be able to walk away from '1408' without being too disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall, if you seen/read a lot of King not to mention the genre films of recent decades, then there's not a lot new here - more the rearrangement of old ideas that suggest something new. It will entertain however, and I like to think of it as a good introduction to the genre for new fans."

","I seen this movie last night and i have to say that i just wasn't impressed. The acting was fine in fact i thought Cusack was fantastic, i thought the film looked the part, special effects and things like that were also up to scratch and it did provide some scary and jumpy moments (though some were predictable).<br/><br/>HOWEVER, this is what i really didn't like about the movie. in nearly all horror films i can think of there was always a motive for what was happening. For example, Scream, two guys slash people because they were influenced by movies they had seen(not the best example, just the first i thought of, obviously there are many more that i don't need to list, think of one for yourself and then think of a motive for it). 1408 on the other hand for me seemed to have no reason why this hotel room had the effect that it had on those who stayed in it. Many will argue that this leaves it to the imagination but i felt it left the movie with a lack of depth. Because of this i left feeling that the story was pretty random and pointless that a hotel room had become so spooky and freaky with no backing story as to why. If someone can explain why room 1408 was the way it was and what or more importantly who was responsible for what was happening in the room i will be satisfied but until then i will still say it lacked meaning and was therefore pointless."

I was hoping that Samuel L Jacksonhad put some LSD in the chocolate he ate and was filming everything while John Cusack is getting crazy and kills himself, but the story of Stephen King is great too. Haha, see this movie, It's great! Especially the part about God and Heaven and stuff, he's so right, the daughter didn't fight her cancer to survive and accepted to die and go to Heaven, 'the great beautiful place', John Cusack said 'Why do we had to fill her with all this ""bullpoo"" ', He's right, I felt butterflies in my stomach when he said that, beautiful.<br/><br/>I saw 'Rose Red' a while ago and it's stupid and silly, this '1408' one from Stephen King is shorter and better, I'd say almost the best movie from Stephen King so far, only the ending is not very great."

","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is an emotionally repressed ghost hunting enthusiast that has no true to life belief in the paranormal. Eslin's daughter Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony) recently passed away, and he has had no emotional release following her death. He has subsequently bottled up all his feelings and poured himself into his work of writing Top 10 books for various most haunted locations through out the United States such as, Top 10 Hotels, Motels, Lighthouses, etc. This writing of novelty books has kept him afloat for long enough, and his dwindling readership is of little concern to this author that is just trying to get by. While going through a small stack of fan letters one day Enslin sees a challenge when the Dolphin Hotel in New York is recommended to him with one exception. He must not stay in room 1408. Mike Enslin takes this as a challenge to his lack luster ghost hunting career and seeks out the vary room he's been told to steer clear of. Not believing in ghosts Enslin makes it a point to meet this challenge head on and dares to test fate and stay in the room that a supposed 56 people have died in. Upon arriving at the Dolphin Hotel, Enslin is told by the hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) in no uncertain terms, that he will not be allowing Mr. Eslin the option of staying in 1408. After dropping a few classic Sam Jackson lines such as, ""That room is ____ing evil,"" and through much bribery and negotiations Eslin cannot be deterred. Cusack pulls the roll off about as well as anyone in Hollywood could, but the story is really the conductor of this train, and we are merely along for the ride. 1408 has its ups and downs, and overall does a good job of scaring the wits out it's audience (one grown audience member even commented a need for their mommy); the movie just has no idea where it wants to end.

","This movie is like being stuck in a dream for 94 minutes because as you watch you question what is real and what it not. There are moments that will shock you, moments that might confuse you, and moments that will make you jump. There are even a few humorous parts. The viewer will not know what to expect. This is typical of Stephen King novels turned to movies. He is definitely a master of suspense. It is one of those movies where you pay attention to every detail because you're not sure which parts are going to be important in understanding the end. It keeps you focused. There are so many movies were I will get into certain parts and then realize my mind kind of wandered away at other parts. This movie is not like that though. It grabbed my attention and held onto the whole way through. The only warning I give is that if you are not open to the idea of the paranormal being real or are a very logical person, you might not like it as much. I only say this because the person I saw this with does not believe in any paranormal things and he did not enjoy the movie as much as I did. However, he did still like it because it's that good. If you like supernatural events, are a Stephen King fan, or looking for an interesting movie that will make you wonder, this is the movie for you. I also think that it is important to try to see in theaters because the effects are much better on a big screen."

"samseescinema","8","0","0","27 June 2007"," a classically styled, old-school haunt
","1408 Reviewed by Samuel Osborn <br/><br/>I remember reading the short story 1408 is based upon. It was a Stephen King yarn, bland in the way his writing gets when the prose aches to be a script. And like most of Mr. King's work, a script was madethe rights to his work apparently aren't hard to obtain from the easy-going writer. The necessary extrapolations were made, cluttering up the short story so it could fill 90 minutes of film and, voila, a movie was made. Between three screenwriters who, combined, have Reign of Fire and Agent Cody Banks to their resumes, a Swedish director with an abysmal American debut (Derailed), and a remarkably mediocre short story for source material, I had 1408 chalked up to be a joke. A sorry stab at the haunted house genre. I, of course, was wrong.<br/><br/>1408 isn't ""torture porn"" as the Saw and Hostel franchises have been deemed; it isn't a Japanese re-hash like The Ring or The Grudge; and also it's not a slasher glory days re-make like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the upcoming Halloween. 1408 is a classically styled, old-school haunt. And it's very effective.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a mythbuster for haunted houses. Once a laudable novelist, now Mr. Enslin slinks around the deepest, phoniest hotels dislodging their claims to supernatural fame. As is obligatory to any Stephen King romp, Mr. Enslin is, at heart, a troubled, middle-aged ordinary Joe. He's likable in the film noir sort of way: an agreeable prick. Life's thrown him some punches and Mr. King finds him a few rounds later, beaten but carrying on alright. Separated from his wife and without children, Mr. Enslin lives on the beach and spends his free time surfing and dressing like an idiot. He receives a postcard from The Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan one day, warning him not to enter the room 1408. Intrigued, he calls the hotel and asks for the room. The receptionist hangs up on him.<br/><br/>It isn't until he's pulled legal strings with his publishing house's lawyer does Mr. Enslin finally convince the hotel's manager, Mr. Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), to allow him the room for one night. 56 people have died in there, he says, either by natural death or suicide. A maid was once locked in the bathroom for no more than a few minutes. By the time Mr. Olin had gotten her out, the maid had gouged both of her eyes out. On this point, even at the risk of over-hyping his main attraction, Director Mikael Hafstrom goes to extensive efforts to make his haunted room a scare even before we set eyes upon it. So when the door finally creaks open, our stomach's already clenched and ready to fling itself up into our throats.<br/><br/>And from that moment on, when the key is turned and 1408 opened, we're treated to dozens of goodies from Mr. Hafstrom's big bucket of scares. The film is loaded with them. But what makes 1408 original is their enigmatic nature. There's no name or physicality to the spook that haunts 1408. It's just an awesome evil. And in this way, the curtain isn't drawn to reveal our opponent. We're never sure what we're up against. This gives the three screenwriters carte blanche on the scares their allowed to dream up.<br/><br/>The pacing also plays a role, as boring a point as that may seem. The scares, though abundant, do well to sneak up on us, compounding quietly behind our nerve endings where they wait to pounce. It's an old trick from the golden days, when censor boards didn't allow excessive gore or grotesque figures onto Hollywood's screens. Directors were forced to use minimalist tricks to crawl under our skin. So even though all that's wrong with 1408 early on is a preternaturally good housekeeping service, a faulty window, and an annoying clock radio, we're scared out of our wits.<br/><br/>But don't worry, Mr. Hafstrom doesn't rely on minimalist mumbo jumbo for 1408's full 94 minutes. The scope soon widens to a point where the reliable troops of CGI are recruited for service. The things this hotel room can do will knock your socks off. And with the ever-lovable John Cusack behind Mike Enslin, the ride's entertainment value is foolproof. And as a note on 2007, between The Hitcher, 28 Weeks Later, Mr. Brooks, Disturbia, 1408, and the upcoming Joshua, this year might be the year for horror's classy comeback.<br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"
"Jonny_Numb","7","0","0","2 July 2007"," Escalating nightmare will ""torture"" you with old-fashioned horror goodness
","Within a summer movie climate piled high with stagnant garbage (hello, threequels!), critical darlings I cannot fathom (have aliens removed everyone's mind in order to make ""Knocked Up"" a success?), and horror offerings that all but beg for the genre to be put to sleep (goodbye, ""Hostel: Part II""!), ""1408"" is like the chilled (and I do mean CHILLED) lemonade that hits the spot on a particularly hot day.<br/><br/>That being said, it should be made clear that the film is based on a short story by Stephen King, whose screen adaptations have grown finer (and more high-profile) over the past decade or so. ""1408"" is no exception. While screenwriters Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karasewski have added some narrative material to tighten the cinematic aspects of the story (though I must say, the guilt-over-a-lost-child subplot is becoming pretty cliché), it remains incredibly faithful to King's original tale; similarly, the notion of ""supernatural"" is made increasingly (and believably) threatening through special effects that manage to frighten with a bare minimum of bloodletting. Like ""Secret Window"" a few years back, ""1408"" is all about building mood through atmosphere and knowledge of character.<br/><br/>King's protagonist, Mike Enslin (John Cusack, in a strong lead role), is a writer whose stock and trade is documenting real-life haunts, but has fallen from his former glory. One day, he receives a curious postcard in the mail from the Dolphin Hotel in New York City; with its cryptic warning (""Do not enter 1408""), Mike is enticed to check it out (with the mentality of debunking a tall tale); after a meeting with the discouraging manager Olin (Samuel L. Jackson, lending a tense professionalism to his small role), the writer is left to his own devices in the room, whose history entails 50-some odd deaths. (And the less said about Enslin's stay, the better.) Director Mikael Hafstrom shows definite skill in building suspense and toying with audience expectations--just when our flawed hero appears to be safe out of harm's way, another complication springs up. My only qualm with this tactic is that it wears thin by the end...nevertheless, Hafstrom should be commended for wielding such shopworn clichés as loud musical cues, jump-scares (one of which got me), and creepy noises in a manner that complements the story while escalating the tension. As with other thrillers, like ""Phone Booth"" and ""Panic Room,"" the confined setting becomes naturally oppressive and suffocating, and the trapped character earns our empathy (if not right away); with ""1408,"" the details of Enslin's daughter feeds into the dream/nightmare reality of the room itself. While ""1408"" outstays its welcome slightly, it is one of this summer's more impressive releases, and a chilling meditation on both internal and external demons."

","The Dolphin Hotel. The Kafka-esquire montage of despair. 56 deaths in so many years, and don't expect to check in unless you never plan on checking out. But sometimes a man must go where angels fear to tread to remember what it is he needs to believe.<br/><br/>I watched this tonight; had to get drunk just to sit through it. I'm not saying it was bad, it was just tame, perfect for those with really thin skin, young teen horror I guess. I love the cast, so that's a plus. I love the premise, which is also good enough to keep me watching to the end, hoping it eventually satisfies. Whether it does or not I'll leave to each person's own experience.<br/><br/>1408 had some great moments, probably from the short story; gotta give King props for that. One could say it's finally a good King adaptation since The Shining. Should have used room 237 again though just for fun.<br/><br/>Scary? No, but all in all it was an enjoyable little throwback to the ghost stories I loved to read as a kid. Right down to the letter, or lack of any letters as it were.<br/><br/>1408 is like Dante's Inferno caught in a loop, never making it to Paradise beyond."

","Lots of people are getting carried away with this movie. It was pretty good. It even convinced me to like John Cusack. You see, I don't think I've seen a Cusack movie before, I've tended to see trailers of his movies that occur average at best, indulgent mediocrity at worst. He has one of those faces, you know, he reminds you of somebody you never liked from school.<br/><br/>Anyway, John is a cynical author who checks into the most haunted room in the universe. He does this against the will of Hotel Manager Samuel L Jackson (acting in usual cruise control). Soon the room transforms into a noisy earthquaking-harrowing-winter-wonderland where dead relatives hang out to haunt John. The bathroom stretches, the pictures wobble, the incidental music intensifies, the screaming mortifies, the sound effects nullify, the knee jerks quantify and in the end you have an assault on the senses worthy of any post-four hour line up for a Universal Studios theme park ride! <br/><br/>I think they could have significantly reduced the use of dramatic music, silence is often much more effective in horror flicks. Also, if I have to complain (I hate complaining you see), the ending wasn't resolved in a satisfying way. I thought the slight twist was dealt with too swiftly and too lightly.<br/><br/>Overall, not bad."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","5","16","27 June 2007"," Very good, but there were things that were left unexplained
","My friend and I saw 1408 yesterday, it looked like such an exciting thriller, and I was even more excited to see it when I saw what great reviews it was getting. 1408 is a guaranteed scare, this film was incredibly intense and very well told. A lot of the scenes were some of the most terrifying that I've seen in film for a while. Not to mention we have not had a great Stephen King flick for a while, so this was a great way to jump back into the game. John Cussack did a terrific job, considering all he had to face in this role, what he had to do on his own, he had to carry the film and did a fantastic job. Way to go, John!<br/><br/>Mike is an author who has written books mostly about places that are haunted, but he's not really famous and his books are not really on the best seller's list. He receives an interesting postcard from The Dolphin Hotel in New York saying ""Don't go to 1408"". He goes to the hotel and gets the room anyways despite the warnings and repeated attempts and bribery's from the manager, Gerold. Mike starts off normally, not impressed with the room, despite it's horrific stories of suicides, drownings, and bizarre behavior from people. Things go from normal to bad fast, he witnesses haunting moments from his past, his father, and his young daughter who passed away from an illness. Not to mention ghosts that just keep coming and coming at him while the room drives his sanity to the brinks.<br/><br/>I would very much recommend 1408, it's the best thriller of the year so far. But I do have a few complaints, maybe I just need to read the book, but like how did the room get evil? Why was the father so haunting to him? There are a few more questions, but I would appreciate some answers if you have them or some impute. Otherwise, please enjoy, this was a great horror/thriller movie that is going to be a huge classic down the road.<br/><br/>8/10"

","To my surprise after seeing a test screening of 1408 I was extremely disappointed. I'm a long time Stephen King fan. I usually like his work when transferred from page to screen, but for me 1408 was all wrong. The plot seemed forced almost contrived to the point of being silly, and instead of being scared I was just hoping for it to get better as time went on. Sometimes even if it is a bad movie the cast can save it, but frankly for me the choices were all wrong. John Cusack will always be a comedy front man in my eyes he seemed really out of place in this movie. After doing a movie like Snakes on a Plane, I really can't take Samuel L. Jackson seriously, maybe that's just a personal thing. I really wanted to like this movie especially after such a promising trailer, but to be honest it just didn't do anything for me. I left the screening thinking 'I Hope King hasn't lost his touch"" 1408 was not the thriller it wanted to be it was just another bad attempt to add into what seems like this years constant flow of disappointing horror movies. This is just my personal opinion maybe others will like this movie better than I did."

","I will never understand why people continue to buy into tripe like this, as we get our 1347th haunted house/hotel/room whatever story, all with the same flaws. I gave this 3 stars because I thought the buildup was pretty effective. In fact until Cusack actually enters the room I was settling in and hoping for the best. But instead of the best, we get almost a one man Cusack stage show that plays out more like an overwrought descent into insanity than it does a ghost story. And then, like all of this breed of story, the wheels come completely off, there are no rules, the main character reacts stupidly to everything, and you spend 45 minutes lost as Cusack runs around his one room breaking things and yelling, and occasionally big special effects that may or may not be in his head come crashing through. It gets tedious quickly. When a character does not know what is real or not, that is fine. When the audience doesn't it just encourages you to detach and sit back chomping popcorn waiting to see if any of the nonsensical special effects you are watching are real, or if its all just a dream. And really, by the end of this one you don't care."

There is no monster, and no murderer. Just one 'very f*cking evil room', to quote the hotel manager. And once the clock starts to run, the main character is subjected to a relentless assault on his mind. This movie creates a palpable sense of malevolence and does so without an on screen villain.<br/><br/>The movie is very entertaining without resorting to the same sort of tricks that most horror movies rely on, and for that alone it is well worth watching."

I couldn't imaging doing anything more or better to make this out-dated short story by Stephen King any better. I was fascinated by this film and watched it until the very end; their was applause in the theater. A well executed effort. I was tired just watching the movie.<br/><br/>John Cusack did the best job you could possibly do in this role; he was perfect, flawless. I kind of have a love hate relationship with John but this performance reminded why I love Mr Cusack. His fits of rage was masterfully executed; his affectionate emotional submission to 1408, when he just couldn't fight any longer was expressed immaculately. their is a lot of dimension John's acting in this film; he's not just smiling and acting cool all the time but giving us a very intimate and personal part of himself; seriously I can't tell when I've expressed such raw and natural emotions in my life.<br/><br/>But the MVP in this film has to go to Samuel L. Jackson. Sam popped the cork in this film. He was the pace setter; Jackson created so much tension in this film that almost everyone around me in the theater was giggling like a school girl, at the apprehension of what was about to take place in room 1408; his description of the entity in room 1408 was so original and 21st century that I don't thing their is another actor who would've conveyed such dread and fear as Sammy does.<br/><br/>I was spooked like a kid left in his room by himself for the first time; I wanted my mommy.<br/><br/>This movie was a great ride; easily charge 12 dollars a ticket."

He was forewarned that this hotel room was different than all the other cheap-thrills that this author bleakly wrote about. This was something he might not walk away from, atleast...56 others didn't. The film was very well made because of its smooth plot progression and the character's personal development from a miserable, hopeless skeptic to a terrified, bewildered believer.

Basically, the ending is different from the short story ending: the short story ends with him coming out of the room emotionally scarred, but the movie ends with him trapped in the room forever.

","I had such high expectations for 1408 and I really feel left down after seeing it. To compare, it was like seeing the trailer of 300, except that movie was great. The trailer made the movie seem so intense, but 1408 wasn't that good. I would have been more excited to see it if it was rated R and not PG-13. That somewhat killed it for me, because now it is classified as a teen thriller, and we all know how great those movies are.<br/><br/>The plot was well done, credit given to Stephen King obviously. The scenes that occurred during the film were good as well such as the water filling the room, the snow and the fire. John Cusack played a convincing role, and as much as I admire the guy, this wasn't the movie for him. The reason I didn't think the movie lived up to its hype was how it ended. It was odd that it ended halfway through but then started up again for more. Everyone in the audience thought it was ending that way and you could hear their groans from the front row.<br/><br/>I say 5 out of 10 stars.

I did enjoy the plot, and was interested to see where it went, but some of the horrors faced in the room are mildly cliché, and while the main character was well developed, I never really found myself fearing for his life.

","I love reading Stephen King novels. And with the recent resurgence of his books being adapted into well-done movies (IT, Pet Sematary, Gerald's Game, Doctor Sleep), I thought I might check out some of the other recent movies made about his works. I have heard good things about 1408 by Mikael Hafstrom so I decided to check it out. I thought it was quite good.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the character of Michael Enslin, a formerly exceptional fiction writer who now spends his time writing cheap paperbacks on the debunking of the paranormal while traveling around looking at supposedly haunted hotels. One day, he receives a mysterious postcard from the Dolphin Hotel that tells to not check in, especially room 1408. Determined to finish his book on Haunted Hotels, Enslin manages to be able to stay at room 1408, despite the extreme warnings of Manager Gerald Olin, and soon learns he won't be getting out in his current state.<br/><br/>John Cusack gives a great performance as Enslin, portraying him as a grieving man who is having severe trouble coping with a terrible loss. The majority of the movie revolves around him and the nightmarish ordeal in the Room. The performances of Samuel L. Jackson, Mary McCormack, and Tony Shalhoub are great also but are woefully underused.<br/><br/>The scares in the film are done very well with a rather slow build-up. There are some parts where you think, also, that there is going to be something terrible about to happen then it doesn't, throwing you completely off-balance and when the actual scares start happening, they hit harder than you think they will.<br/><br/>Finally, I watched the alternate ending cut, which is pretty good.

What other explanation does there need to be? I'm not sure how some people could not follow this movie, or what they were looking for. It was pretty straightforward and very well done. The man is being assaulted nonstop by a supernatural force and cannot tell what is real and what isn't. It's SUPERNATURAL. As in, a ghost story.

"filipemanuelneto","6","1","2","18 January 2017"," A good movie but with too many special effects.
","In this film, a skeptic tries to investigate (and demystify) the story of an allegedly haunted hotel room. The character, played by John Cussack, is quite stubborn and is convinced that the hotel has no ghosts. Less certain of this is the manager, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who does everything to demoralize the investigator, trying to protect his hotel from that ill-famed room, which remains closed and inaccessible. The two actors work well together and do a good job, especially if we consider that they are more accustomed to working on action films. But the great actor in the movie is the room itself. We never see an entity. In fact, the film is not clear about the existence of a ghost. We see, instead, a man in crisis, struggling with remorse of varied origin, with weights in consciousness. The isolation of the room confronts the investigator Enslin with all these ghosts which, in fact, may be no more than the ghosts of his own past. This is the beauty of this film, deeply psychological: sometimes the ghosts of our lives are the ones that can destroy us if we confront them. The film, however, commits the terrible sin of exaggeration, especially from the final third. It seems that director Mikael Håfström was fascinated by the possibilities of special effects, deciding to deeply distort the room in the strangest ways, trying to fit this into the film and making it a little intractable, taking the focus away from the psychological depth thought out in the script. Special effects, no matter how well done they may be, have their time and should be served to the public in the right measure."

The story is simple, yet still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for every minute of its 104 minute run-time. <br/><br/>It starts off unsettling, with obviously something wrong.

It's fantastic, its the movie that made me realize that I love horror movies. Despite its greatness, it isn't quite a 9/10.

","1408 (2007): Dir: Mikael Safstrom / Cast: John Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson, Mary McCormack, Tony Shalhoub, Lee Cariou: Based on the Stephen King short story about a hotel room of forbidden nature. John Cusack plays a washed up horror novelist who visits places of strange happenings then writes about it. He visits the Dolphin Hotel but the manager forbids his entry. This was suggested to him as a challenge but once inside he sees ghostly images that urge him to kill himself. He attempts contact with his wife via his laptop but any attempt to escape is met with tragedy. What is truly interesting is how Cusack solves his dilemma and proves himself. Director Mikael Safstrom creates endless happenings and Cusack plays out the sarcasm of disbelief that turns crazed as images of people jumping out the window appear. Samuel L. Jackson is wasted as the warning hotel manager. Jackson seems way too accessible to these brief roles when he is so much better in lead roles in superior films. Mary McCormack appears briefly as Cusack's wife but we are given a background where tension exists. They contact by laptop and she will have the privilege of knowing Cusack's innocence. Tony Shalhoub as his publicist is another wasted appearance. The visual imagery are a big payoff with a screenplay that works beyond what many thrillers present. The result is a flawed yet chilling film filled with ghostly images. Score: 7 / 10"

","The good thing about this movie is that it allows for multiple interpretations. However on a second viewing my vision doesn't change. The room is evil and is playing tricks on its guests. I don't think it were just Mike Enslin's hallucinations, how else can the victims before him be explained? His experiences in room 1408 were also very useful as it made him realize it what really was the reason he was writing about haunted places, his own personal demons and what eventually drove him and his wife apart. Visually a treat even though sometimes over the top this movie doesn't give you a moment of rest once Enslin is in the room. There clearly is a moralistic undertone in the movie but I don't mind. It's a good movie allowing for multiple revisits but I would leave a considerable amount of time between them."

","A typical PG-13 horror movie consists of a bunch of dumb teenagers aimlessly running around in their film either trying (and failing) to solve some urban myth or being killed off in the least inventive ways possible. Of course you get the rare Insidious or The Ring, but for the most part, you'll end up with a movie like Ouija or One Missed Call. 1408, however, is the former. Based on Stephen King's creepy short story, 1408 is about an author named Mike Enslin (because it's not a King story if there's no author involved) who writes about haunted houses, graveyards, and the likes. He gets a mysterious letter in his mail one day that tells him ""not to go to room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel"". Viewing this as a challenge, Enslin, who's played flawlessly by John Cusack, finds this hotel and gains access to the forbidden room 1408.<br/><br/>The horror begins before Enslin even steps into the room. As he's pacing the halls of the 14th floor, he finds himself back at an empty open elevator, as if the hotel is telling Enslin not to go into the room. Slightly confused, he finds 1408 and walks inside. Mike's first five minutes in the room is rather boring. Nothing particularly supernatural happens until his clock all of the sudden starts playing ""We've Only Just Begun"", and a 60 minute timer begins counting down, in response to the hotel manager who says that no one has ever lasted more than an hour in the room. The movie then becomes an increasingly terrifying, non-stop haunted house (or, in this case, haunted hotel room) ride that relentlessly scares the audiences with a growing sense of dread and a very heavy atmosphere. 1408 doesn't scare us with what does pop out; it scares us with what might pop out. If you've ever seen Oculus, this movie is similar to that, only in a hotel room.<br/><br/>Being based on a very short story, the structure of this movie is extremely simple. 1408 is a one-man show, and John Cusack is the star. For three-quarters of the movie, it's just him in the room witnessing all these bizarre and scary events. This movie isn't cluttered with unnecessary backstories, side-characters, or plot twists. It's a simple and effective horror movie that leaves a lingering sting. 1408 may not be as ground-breaking as Carrie or The Shining, but this movie is definitely one of the best Stephen King adaptations to date."

Don't they have a plan or script before starting to shoot a movie? Main actor is as flat as a chip board. Samuel Jackson has pitifully lowered his standard by working in this piece of crap. Do not waste your money and time to watch this movie."

","Alcoholic writer expects everyone to put up with his hallucinations. Yes, another Stephen King story.<br/><br/>Overall it's corny, but with some genius weird moments + way too many bloviations. In the end, nothing is explained. But we do get the sentimental back story - Daddy, do you still love me? - and the long suffering wife (very beautiful).<br/><br/>I haven't enjoyed a King story since I was fourteen years old, but he clearly adapts brilliantly to cinema. IMDb loves that prison movie ... you know, the one I think is just OK.<br/><br/>The pace was really off - at 40 mins I wondered how much further the story could go without a swift end. Eventually it slacked off to give a contrast of reality, but always with the sense we'd get back to the hallucinations. Which we did, but minus any twist or wit.<br/><br/>I got the sense Cusack was trying to sophisticate this up - he mentioned Kafka and looked like a puffy drunk. And what about Jackson in the final funeral scene? Appearance fee? <br/><br/>Watchable because of Cusack - but no scares, no jumps, no insight."
"vostf","6","1","2","30 August 2014"," Well done nowhere near impressive
","Stephen King is fantastic writer, he can take the simplest idea and build a whole story around to keep you captivated as you live the book. On the big scream most of the writer's talent vanishes: it is only one depiction of a story for which you would have build your own images based on the author's words. And the images summoned are countless times more powerful than the clean ones an adaptation will patch together.<br/><br/>1408 illustrates this point perfectly: the horror in room 1408 is beyond what the hero had imagined because it was not about some random ghost or spooky decoration, but really about his own personal tremors building up deep-rooted anguish and fear. In a book you would make up images that will really put you under the skin of the hero, in a movie... it is only a movie.<br/><br/>So 1408 is not bad, it's just that it cannot create the same claustrophobic tension as a good horror book. Visually the average user is too well-used to those haunted places' set of supernatural happenings."
"cathalokane","7","1","2","20 December 2013"," Competent shocker that slightly loses its way
","This was setting itself up to be one of my favourite horror films of all time for the first half of the film. However, things went downhill in the second half.<br/><br/>Cusack does a great job as our protagonist as the cynical, small-time hack who spends his time debunking ghost stories, knowing that these stories are just PR for the hotels in which he stays. He sells a few books and they get a bit more business - everyone's a winner! His world-weariness comes across really well in the opening stages but everything goes a little bit awry when he gets a postcard directing him to the Dolphin Hotel in New York.<br/><br/>On arriving at the hotel we are treated to a great scene between Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, where Jackson tries to dissuade Cusack from staying in the room. This scene does a fantastic job of setting up room 1408 in the watcher's mind as we are told about its history, so that by the time Cusack inserts his key into that 1408 lock, the tension is palpable.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes in the room is great viewing with the spookiness and fright levels ramping up slowly but surely, but just as the film gets to the fear-sweet-spot, it goes just a little too far and enters into silly/surreal territory which ultimately breaks the atmosphere, and it doesn't ever quite get it back.<br/><br/>This is a film, like so many in the horror genre, that would have hugely benefited from reigning things in just a little as the film progresses. The breaks should have been applied earlier and the spookiness and atmosphere of the room should have been allowed to mature. Instead it just gets a bit too much, to the extent that I lost interest twenty minutes from the end. The atmosphere just dissipated as the vibe went from spooky haunted room to full blown psychedelic acid trip.<br/><br/>It's a bit of a shame as so much good work was done in the early stages of the film, and the production and acting were spot on all the way through.<br/><br/>Some might find the way this film ramps to its crescendo appealing, but I did not. Despite that, it's well worth a watch."

Unfortunately, I could easily predict most of the ""scare"" moments, but it has a really good horror ""feeling"", because of the music, compositions and the color grading. Later this movie, I discovered that the main character was seeing his self and all the mistakes he has made in his life... He was seeing his kid dieing, but... that doesn't make any sense! I didn't even know he had a daughter or even a relationship... The watcher of this movie can't really have ""sympathy"" for a character he doesn't even know a little. After this disappointment he also realized that it was a dream; the most overused cliché in film history and so not well used at this moment. I almost wanted to turn of the TV! Luckily it wasn't a dream, or maybe it was (that's still not clear to me) but this was the moment I calmed down and watched the movie till the end. Then the better part came what showed me what the movie was meant to be. I saw a good ending, with a little plot-twist and finally I saw the little horror aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this came too late... After all it didn't really impress me. Sorry.

It may not be as scary as some of the classics out there, but it is impossible to watch it without admiring its utter originality.<br/><br/>Stephen King (The author of the short story on which this film is based) lets us into a fantastical world where our conceived boundaries between dreams and reality are illusory or even nonexistent. The director's rendition of the story is simply amazing and I'm sure King himself must have been very pleased with the results. <br/><br/>1408 is primarily a visual movie; it is nothing short of a continuous bombardment on your visual apparatus. I mentioned the movie to my brother today and he immediately started recalling specific scenes that he liked.

","What better is there to write about a film, but that it is catchy every time I see it. By now I saw it five times - and it happened again. And this time it got a very special side effect: I saw it under the aspect of the ego. With that, the whole movie wins even more depth. Imagine the whole film as a metaphor for how the ego acts - and what results you earn. When you do that, it gets a real close portrait of the acting of any ""normal"" person in modern society. Mike Enslin had the free choice - but driven by unconscious motives he checks in to his personal hell. A behavior most people do all the time. And then his ego finds guilt in anything - but never in himself. The whole movie can be seen as a fight of an ego to escape the truth. But room 1408 doesn't allow that. Therefore the room isn't actual ""evil"". It's just what l-i-v-e happens. Mike Enslin has to face the facts of his life. The room is kind of a mirror to him. If you are able to make a connection to your own life, this film is even educating. But most of all: It is so well done, that it is hard to believe, that this film isn't known too well. So: If you are looking for a spooky event: This is the first choice."

","1408 was a different horror movie with alternate endings. And one of its kind !!! Mike Enslin is a ghost stories writer who visits to the haunted places and describes about his sensation in his books. One such fine day he gets to know about evil room 1408 in Dolphin Hotel and decides to visit the place to seek the truth. He is objected and restrained by the manager (Samuel L Jackson)As he enters the room , he experiences the horrifying , gruesome incidents that he leaves his stone unturned and he changes his mind and tries to leave the room . But, he realizes that he cannot escape the horrendous situation and he fights back to see the light of the day. Mikael Håfström adapted the story written by Stephen Hawking. Though , the story is centered around one room buts it's the atmosphere inside the room which makes this film worth a watch. The CGI , the background score, the chilling moments makes it a perfect popcorn entertainment. You have to watch every reel carefully to understand the film and you will soon realize that it is worth interesting to watch. John Cusack carries the film on his shoulder. The actor shows immense talent in terms of his grandeur performs. He emotes so much through his expression that I would hardly believe if anyone apart from Cusack could play the part so vividly. Samuel L Jackson is effective in a minor role. There are two versions to the film ending. One , in which he survives the fire attack and gets up in the hospital with his wife beside his bed and the another one where he sacrifices his life by destroying the room and ends the supernatural era. This one is sure going to be loved by ones who are sucker for good twist and turns thrillers. Good– 3.5/5"

","Finally a good horror movie!! I was so reluctant to watch 1408 expecting a usual, gory, deformed-monster-running-after-a-blonde-chick movie. Nevertheless, I'm glad I was let down. The movie is based on a Stephen King short story, which pretty much explains the refined sense of horror. The story tackles fear in its most basic and instinctual forms, playing on the psyche of the human mind and soul. Hotel rooms, as mentioned in the movie, are creepy by nature, not to mention the notorious, haunted ones. However, to use the 'haunted place' theme in a 21st-century drama is quite a challenge. That's why giving it a psychological depth was a smart move. <br/><br/>I never considered John Cusack more than a 'cute' actor, and watching him in a great horror movie like this one left me confused. He played his role naturally and well, but not well enough to blow my mind away. I give it 4 stars with a clear conscience."

Some people might like it, I suppose - I do remember some friend or another tell me that 1408 is cool - but frankly I have no idea why anyone would.<br/><br/>You see, there is this writer turned psychic investigator who, after the death of his daughter and eventual separation from the wife, does not believe in anything and is looking for haunted places in order to sell ""10 haunted (something)"" books. Typical setup, he gets an intriguing letter about a haunted room in a hotel.<br/><br/>That being said, the beginning was kind of obvious, but not bad. The atmosphere was creepy enough, Samuel L. Jackson had the best role he landed in quite some time and I started hoping. As any long time Hollywood movie watcher could tell you, you must leave all hope before you watch one.<br/><br/>Long story short, by the middle of the game I was hoping the ending would be bad, like the character winning over ""the evil room"" without any merit, but that it would come soon. It did not, mind you, instead came a false ending, which was pretty obvious because there was quite some time left of the movie, so it didn't work on any level.<br/><br/>In the end, the tough supernatural investigator completely caved in (or rather, he gave up from the first minutes when his hand got hurt - awww - but the room took him hostage) and started acting like an insane monkey, leaving the screenwriters to take care of any decency in the ending of the film. And, of course, they didn't even try.<br/><br/>Bottom line, the movie stank on so many levels, that I could write a novel (get it?) about how bad it was.

John Cusack is great as Enslin, a man who has lost something close to him and now feels he has to find ghosts in order to find what he lost. John portrays Enslin so well, becoming extremely paranoid and disturbed as his character is stuck in 1408. The supporting cast is great as well, with Samuel L. Jackson filling in the shoes of Gerald Olin, the hotel manager, who knows what the room truly is, and Mary McCormack as Enslin's wife, who he is separated from. The story is fantastic, with so much background filled in about the room and how is has affected many people in various ways over the years, and as you come to see how powerful 'it' is, you also see how the room truly is a thing. 1408 is among the best Stephen King adaptations of all time and should be seen by all Stephen King fans, and anyone who likes a great thriller.<br/><br/>9/10 Stars***"

"IheartCali5882","6","1","2","27 June 2010"," Strong start, but loses its way.
","The first half hour of 1408 is spot on. It shows the character Mike Enslin (John Cusack) as a hack writer covering America's most haunted destinations. Because of his job, he's a natural cynic where ghosts and paranormal phenomena are concerned. According to Enslin, he's never actually seen a certified case of a haunted building. There's always a rational explanation hidden there somewhere, and up until the point that we're introduced to him, he's never been proved wrong. So shortly thereafter he receives an intriguing postcard inviting him to stay at a New York hotel, specifically room 1408. He's been told that no one ever lasts more than 30 minutes in that room, and those that do are not in any condition to tell about it. So the premise is obviously that Enslin will go to this room, and that the majority of scenes will take place there.<br/><br/>It's got a pretty predictable plot; non-believer becomes a believer. I don't mind predictable when it's done well and keeps me entertained. The first half of the film is done very well. It's just that somewhere around the midpoint it starts to drag and become a bit scattered. There are just one too many jump moments, and after so many they start to lose their impact. And I wasn't really a fan of those animation-style ghosts (think cartoon caricatures). If they had been more zombie-like it would have been much scarier. After about 30 minutes of watching him in the room, the film started to feel a little bit sluggish. I felt like saying ""We get the point. So what happens now?"" The movie does tell us but it just waits too long. And when the finale comes, it flip flops back on itself just one too many times.<br/><br/>In spite of this, 1408 has a great deal of genuinely creepy moments. It's made well and has a lead star who can carry just about any material that he's given. With one more turn at the editing table, this film would have easily been a 7/8. Still, it's definitely worth a one-time viewing.<br/><br/>6/10"

","I am always eager to watch movies based on Stephen King's work, some are amazing but some are let downs. I think the story is important, but the screenplay and direction doesn't come across in the same chilling manner and it disappoints the viewer. I have not read the short story, but I do blame it on those factors.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays a writer who goes all over visiting so-called haunted places so he can stay and write about them and let his viewers know that nothing has ever happened to him. When he is told to visit 1408 he doesn't pay it much attention. Samuel L. Jackson plays the hotel manager who begs him not to go there. The room is no longer in use, but writer Mike insists. Once there he quickly realizes the room is indeed no joke, and his night in 1408 is a living Hell.<br/><br/>The directing wasn't very great, I think all of the shots of John entering the room and looking around the room should have been from his point of view, the fact we are often in the room looking out at him, takes a creepiness away from it. I think the ghosts are badly shown and there could've been some great chances to spook the audience but it wasn't done. Cusack and Jackson both did a great job in their parts, most of the other cast members had tiny roles, but all were okay.<br/><br/>The movie goes by pretty fast and that was a good thing, I was never bored at any given time. There were too many things I didn't like, as I said above the p.o.v. angles should've been altered, the movie should've did scary set-ups to scare the viewer, esp. with the little girl. There were horrible scenes where John thinks he has gotten out and is with his wife only to find its a mind trick, I thought that whole section was taking so much away from the film.<br/><br/>The film had a promising beginning and kept setting up for a scare, it just never happened.. not scary...avoid this movie if you wanna be scared or creeped out, but if you like psychological thrillers it might satisfy you.<br/><br/>4/10 just because it does entertain to a degree."

And boy, when things really starts happening, it comes those shivers through your entire spine. I'm not kidding, I've sh*t my pants watching this on the big screen and I still do when I watch it from my DVD.<br/><br/>And when you watch it, it's so intense that it's like if you were there with John Cusack, experiencing the whole thing.

Yes, I've watched The Shining before, and I'm still a huge fan of the movie, but when I first watched years ago, I was more interested in science fiction literature. But after 1408 and The Myst, I've read the 1408 tale from King and started to get interested by his work, and bought The Shining and Dreamcatcher books to read.<br/><br/>So, in a nutshell, just watch this movie, pal.

I found the reviews, the ratings and the description of this movie to be rather misleading.<br/><br/>One user commented - 'There are, of course, those who will be disappointed by 1408--because when all is said and done, they will find it's not a movie about a freaky hotel room, but rather the man who's trapped in that hotel room and what he finds there.' This is a fair point, this movie is more about the psychological, emotional state of the main character Mike Enslin and has a lot to do with his past; therefore if you are expecting a movie primarily about a haunted, paranormal, supernatural or frightening hotel room, do not bother. I realise that the movie is advertised to be just that, but it is not.<br/><br/>As an avid watcher of horror and supernatural movies I tend to choose Asian horror movies or European horror movies rather than American/US movies where special effects tend to be over the top and high budget and take over the actual plot/story. There are some quite impressive special effects in this movie, so if that is your thing then you may enjoy this I just found the whole thing to be unbelievable, unrealistic and poorly presented to the viewer.<br/><br/>I had been really looking forward to sitting in my darkened room watching a movie masterpiece full of frightening, shocking and disturbing scenes accompanied by a deep, dark and thought-provoking plot.

"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","2","3 August 2009"," One of Steven King's best.
","1408 is a spectacular scary film. Not only is it a scary film, it's also a tear jerker. John Cusack stars as Michael Enslin, a haunted destination author who is told not to go to room 1408 at the Dolphin hotel in New York. He goes there anyways. Once he gets there, the manager of the hotel Gerad Olin(Samuel L. Jackson) tries to bribe him out of it by Scotch and Knicks tickets. But of course he refuses. So he stays in the room. Appaerently, there have been fifty six deaths in that room. One person even drowned in soup while staying in that room. Michael goes through tons of stuff. The room even gets inside his head and causes him to see things and people from his past. 1408 is a fantastic film. If you exclude The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile, then this is his best film. All of Steven King's horror films usually suck. 1408 is one of the rare few that actually doesn't and is a great film. John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson are amazing actors. Both are probably on my favorites list. Supported by scares, drama and a great cast, 1408 is a top notch scary film.<br/><br/>1408: ****/****"
"tsmith417","3","1","2","30 April 2009"," Typical Stephen King story
","When I caught this movie on TV I didn't know it was a Stephen King adaptation but I should've realized right away because it had all the typical King trademarks: plot devices that make no sense, no character development, major characters that disappear halfway through without explanation, and unsatisfying dead ends.<br/><br/>John Cusack, a writer, gets invited to stay in a haunted hotel room. The hotel manager, Samuel L. Jackson, could be God or he could be Satan, it is never made clear which, probably because Mr. King didn't know himself.<br/><br/>The film's complete title should be ""1408, or How To Trash A Hotel Room In 60 Minutes Or Less"". I was constantly distracted by how many furnishings got broken in the course of a one-hour stay by Cusack's character. At least the other room inhabitants, the ones who gouged their own eyes out or jumped out of the window, had the decency to leave the room and its furniture intact and only destroy themselves.<br/><br/>A woman with an old-fashioned baby carriage is entering another room just as Cusack enters his. Who is she? Who cares? The thermostat in the room is broken. Why is it stuck at 80 degrees? Who knows? Cusack finds that he is trapped inside the room because the door is locked. It was at this point I found myself yelling at the television, ""Take the %#@*& hinges apart you &%$#@* idiot!"" Is Cusack dead? Is he in Hell? Purgatory? Why? His daughter died but he didn't kill her, she died of an illness, so why should he be punished this way? Because he left his wife when he couldn't deal with the child's death? Even the meanest nun will admit that's not a reason to suffer eternal damnation.<br/><br/>He sees ghosts of other people who killed themselves in room 1408. Is his hour of suffering overlapping theirs? Does everyone get the same hour in which to suffer? Is that why he sees these people whenever he is outside the hotel room? And why does he only see a couple of the other victims? Why not all 56 of them? And what ever happened to Samuel L. Jackson's character? Why does he show up only inside the mini-bar and never anywhere else? The list of unanswered questions goes on and on, and so does the trashing of room 1408, and it was all just too much for me. I understand the story developed out of an outline Mr. King was making to teach students how to write novels; I pray to The Almighty that none of those students took his advice."
"sun_kwon","3","1","2","4 April 2009"," Too many unanswered questions...
","The first 30 minutes or so of this film were actually quite captivating. The story built itself up very well. The anticipation of wanting to finally see what this room was all about was great.<br/><br/>Then, he finally gets in the room and at that point the film kind of goes bland. Too many loose ends, too many unanswered questions, too many unanswered back stories that were presented.<br/><br/>My main continuity issue with this movie is that it was said before he entered the room that electronics tend to not work inside 1408. But, his cellphone worked, his laptop worked-with full internet capabilities, the television worked, all the lights within the room worked, etc.<br/><br/>I'm also confused as too why the ""ghosts"" if you will, were electronic looking and would fizzle out, as if it were done with a projector of sorts.<br/><br/>I don't know what too think. Too many ideas were thrown around with no attempt at answering them.<br/><br/>I suppose if you enjoy a movie with a limited ""boo"" factor, which has no substance or attempt at creating a back story, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>Watching this was too much effort with not enough reward."
"The-Kissable-Writer","7","1","2","7 February 2009"," 1408: shining the spotlight on the ending of the theatrical cut.
","This dark horse of a film walks a tightrope: how do you adapt a Stephen King psychological horror story set in a hotel without awakening ""The Shining"" fans' wrath? Working off a skimpy three dozen page novella, director Mikael Hafstrom sparks interest in and empathy for his protagonist, the morose pulp word-smith Mike Enslin (John Cusack) as he duels with an evil f-ing room. Hafstrom is clever enough to use the horror from within, but his true masterstroke is the concept of repetition as hell itself. The latter being a concept touched upon by another Stephen King's short from ""Everything's Eventual"" (the same bundle in which ""1408"" is published), namely ""That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French"". I think it's a safe bet that's where Hafstrom got his mustard.<br/><br/>ENDING: Mike lights the room ablaze (literally a hell of a way to go) and survives the inferno miraculously thanks to his wife's intervention in the nick of time. As he later rummages through his charred possessions, he finds his trustworthy voice-recorder. He presses play and hears a record of his encounter with his dead daughter in 1408. He throws his wife, who had been skeptical about the whole ordeal up until this point, a look with worlds of meaning in it. FADE TO BLACK.<br/><br/>If one takes the events at face value, the end brings forth a resolution: what occurred in that room really happened. When digging deeper, another theory is unearthed, based on the old switch-a-roo past the half-way point. Let me set up the time-line for you: First Enslin takes his surfboard out for a spin and an aggressive tidal wave knocks him senseless. He washes out onto the shore. Then he sets foot in The Dolphin's notorious hotel suite. After a series of events where the room toys with Enslin, it floods and he wakes up on that very same shore again. A plane flies through his field of vision sporting a phone number containing the numbers 1,4,0 and 8. An epilogue plays out that seems to conclude the movie. However, in a spectacular and haunting scene, he discovers the epilogue is a dream. He exclaims ""I thought I was out"", as he finds himself located back in the room. Then he throws an impromptu Molotov cocktail, survives and plays the tape as elaborated on in one of the previous paragraphs.<br/><br/>The way the plot folds back onto itself in the middle of the runtime fuels the theory that Enslin is still in room 1408 after he hears his daughter's voice at the end of the movie's runtime. In fact, the one ending creates enough ambiguity to feed no less than three theories. Bear with me now as I explain.1)Either he's gone insane and everything in the room is a figment of his imagination. This is quite plausible as he's plagued by flashbacks in which we learn his child has died, he's left his wife and his father suffers from Alzheimer's. Reason enough to not have his ducks in a row. This is a much used variant of the 'it-was-all-a-dream' cop-out. Lately the 'he-turns-out-to-be-schizo' cop-out is more frequent still. These are not very satisfying conclusions.2)Or he's really out and has conquered his personal demons by pouring his heart out in his new book.3)Or his wife is stuck in the room. This stems from the people who don't buy the Enslin in the epilogue being real. The strange, bordering on evil, look Enslin throws his wife at the very end can signify a demonic clone, much like the one that beacons his wife to come get him (on the computer screen).4)The last lines of Enslins new book are: no more ghost stories for me,I've checked out. But has he really? This is my personal favorite theory: he's still in the room! Follow my train of thought: There are some similarities between when the room first fools him into thinking he's out, and the epilogue(after the fire). First of all, both plot twists come forth from a destruction via natural elements(water and fire). Second of all, both times he ends up with the best life one can dream up: his wife forgives him, and he's got a foot in the door of reprising his marriage where he left it. Third, he writes the same book. His wife asks him how he can write so fast, he replies: simple, I've wrote this book once before already.He is forced to relive this hour in the ninth circle of hell(see ""Dante's Inferno"")until all eternity. Possibly as a punishment for his egotistical road of life: abandoning your wife after the death of her child because you can't stop wallowing in self-pity? Big misstep.5)A slight nuance on that last theory: Enslin really died in the surfing accident and is tested in 1408. The result will determine whether or not he gets into heaven. Heaven: if he takes the room down with him (the selfless choice). Hell: if he commits suicide. A lot of religions name suicide as the ultimate sin because you basically defy God by refusing the gift of life. The repeated hour in 1408 is purgatory.<br/><br/>Additionally, looked through my storyteller glasses, it's also much more satisfying than a cliché death of the hero (director's cut). Such an intensely emotional movie is required to end in one of two extremes: either he escapes safe and sound and the room gets turned to cinder or he meets his demise and 1408 survives."

","Funny how many times you could see the label of the bottle. ""Les cinquante sept deces : The fifty seven deaths"". The hotel manager tells Mike there were 56 deaths in the room and serves him a cognac called The fifty seven deaths! For the people who don't know if Mike lives or not at the end, here's what I think! The hotel manager in his office drinking, a cognac,cheers him and says: ""Well done, Mr Enslin! Well done!"" When Mike sees brick walls surrounding him, you could read ""burn me alive"" on one of them. It's how he got the idea to burn the place even if he had to perish! But did he perish? One of the best King's movies I've ever seen! What makes this movie so scary? The number of details...In many horror movies those days are filled with blood, zombies, special effects and, not cleverly arranged...If you are talented you just need a room and talented actors and you make a great movie! Well done, Mr King! Well done!"
"scott-keiser","7","1","2","3 January 2009"," A true psychological horror
","The movie is set staring a washed up writer, Mike Enslin played by John Cusack, whose books on the paranormal sell on bargain book racks in every bookstore. For the mans chosen path he believes in nothing, good nor evil, it seems because of the loss of his daughter. The movie really gets going after he receives a post card in the mail telling him not to go in room 1408. Apparently this was one of many and he finally decided to check it out.<br/><br/>The room is set in the Dolphin Hotel in New York City. After a small but well played role by Samuel Jackson as the hotel manager who tries to dissuade him from staying in the room, the inevitable happens and Enslin checks in. The room is rather dull, nothing out of the ordinary or special. The occurrences start off slow but the pace quickly builds.<br/><br/>The room is not the traditional haunted house where things leap out from the darkness. The room is darkness itself. The room manifests real to life images of the darkest times in Enslin's life.<br/><br/>The movie is wonderful because it never deviates from a central theme. The entire movie is held up by Cusack who plays the role very convincingly displaying his versatility as an actor. Although he has to play a man who is slipping into insanity he is still able to keep the personality of his character. How he does this is quite mesmerizing.<br/><br/>1408 is not a typical horror of walking zombies, ghosts, or monsters. This horror explores the darkness of an individuals past and brings it forth in the most evil way imaginable. King outdid himself with this fantastic horror."

"claptonisgod53","7","1","2","6 October 2008"," Good adaption of the short story!
","The main purpose of taking a story to be portrayed on a film is so that the audience can see the directors perspective. Some movies stay true to the book, while others veer from the book completely. I have not read Stephen King's short story ""1408"", but I was still impressed with the movie. What I really liked was the fact that this movie was able to do was stretch out a short story to a full length film. For a PG-13 film, this movie delivers higher than expected.<br/><br/>1408 is an overall good pop-corn horror flick. It supplies a decent amount of jumps and scares, while maintaining a chilling atmosphere.<br/><br/>What I thought was outstanding was the lead performance by John Cusack. He was able to make this movie something somewhat believable, rather than just have a guy talk to himself for an hour and a half. Since no other character received more than 15 minutes of screen time, it was good to see that he was able to make up for the small amount of characters with his one performance.<br/><br/>Overall, 1408 is a very fun way to kill an hour and a half. It is surprisingly effective, chilling, and it supplies a good amount of good entertainment, which is something that most modern horror films aren't able to do. Don't be turned off by the PG-13 rating, it's a good film."

","Upon watching the film ""1408"" i realised that what separated this film from the average horror fare was a number of reasons. I won't go into the plot because there would be far better descriptions elsewhere than what i can provide.<br/><br/>The most important reason was the exceedingly excellent performance of John Cusack. He carried this film solely and completed what was a dark, suspenseful and claustrophobic ride. The film often relied on the mood and atmosphere, rather than jump-out scares (despite the film containing a couple).<br/><br/>Samuel l. Jackson was also put to good use. His shady and confident persona set the tone of what was to come before Cusack even entered the room. If you are to watch this, i would strongly suggest you watch the theatrical ending rather than the lesser, and rather disappointing alternate ending. I won't go into details as to not reveal what happens, but it is a rather fitting end to a surprisingly good movie.<br/><br/>Whilst the film is not without it's flaws, the combination of Cusack and the film's growing tension made me walk out of the cinema with the feeling that I got my money's worth."

I could almost picture myself in the shoes of John Cusack's character and felt very sorry for him going through a living hell of a repeated living nightmare that the room keeps dishing out to him. Samuel L. Jackson plays a very convincing role of trying to talk Cusack's character out of staying the night in room 1408. My only complaint is the beginning of this movie moves somewhat slow. However, I think it is necessary to build up the suspense for what's to come later. See this movie if you want to be spooked."

","1408 is a very good horror movie, as much as I didn't expect it to be. I guess I should've known it would be this good seeing how it is based on the literary work of Stephen King. 1408 follows a man named Mike Enslin. He believes, after much trial and error, that there is no such thing as the paranormal. But then he stays at Room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel, and discovers that paranormal activity is most definitely real!<br/><br/>The reason this movie was so good (besides the fact that it's based on a King book)is that the acting was simply remarkable on John Cusack's behalf, and most of the other actors as well. Also, it was portrayed very well on film, thus making it very easy to buy into. After seeing the movie you might actually believe in the supernatural. So needless to say, I'd recommend this movie, and after seeing how well done it was, it seems impossible for any fan of scary movies not to like this one as well."

It is a very tough mind that can still be able to analyze even in an extremely hallucinated situation. He never gives up which matches the words his dad would say "" I used to be...

"cchase","9","1","2","9 June 2008"," Don't ""OVERLOOK"" This One...
","Stephen King has always been a big fan of haunted places, and has carried on the honored literary tradition of introducing his legions of fans to locations that are completely terrifying and unforgettable. At the top of the list (at least for me) would have to be THE SHINING'S Overlook Hotel and the Marsten House from 'SALEM'S LOT. <br/><br/>Well, one visit to 1408, and suddenly you'll realize that those two garden spots for supernatural shocks are just for wimps. If you can survive an hour in this particular room, you can survive anything. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, author Mike Enslin (John Cusack) doesn't know this. Once a terrible family tragedy shattered his life, he devoted the bulk of his career to writing about and demystifying the supernatural, the unexplainable. He travels around the country, staying at so-called haunted hotels, mansions, houses and other places, then writing about them in cult-worthy bargain-bin knockoffs with titles like ""The 10 Most Violent Vacation Spots"", that sort of thing. Most of the tales of local spookery are nothing more than feeble fables, gussied up by the proprietors of failing lodgings and B&B's to drum up customers to pump up their sagging businesses. <br/><br/>But one day, as he's thumbing through the mound of letters and postcards he receives daily from places who would welcome one of his visits, one postcard catches his eye. It's from the world-famous Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan, and the message is clear and simple: ""DO NOT ENTER 1408.""<br/><br/>Used to having people all but bribe him to come and check out their haunted hostels, the message piques Mike's interest. He wants into this room in the worst way, even after he meets the more-than-slightly menacing General Manager of the Dolphin, Mr. Gerald Olin, (Samuel L. Jackson in an elegantly eerie role.) With the greatest reluctance and the most dire warnings to Mike imaginable, Olin finally forks over the key to the one room the Dolphin usually refuses to check anyone into...and where over 50 guests in the hotel's nearly 100-year history have availed themselves of a very special kind of ""express check-out"" service...using every method from homemade nooses and straight razors, to taking swan dives out of the window...<br/><br/>It isn't long after he checks into 1408, that Mike begins to realize how right Mr. Olin was. It's going to be one stay he'll remember for a very long time...and so will you.<br/><br/>I didn't have the pleasure of reading the short story that was the basis of this script. I was also not familiar with director Mikael Hafstrom's other work, since I have yet to see DERAILED. One thing's pretty clear: Hafstrom and writers Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski are definitely die-hard King fans, because even if they aren't slavishly faithful to the original prose, the FEEL of a King story is there, much in the same way the skillful adaptations of Frank Darabont capture the essence as well. The creeping sense of dread and unease; that queasy, rattling feeling that everything is slightly off-kilter and about to get MUCH worse...that's in the best and most unsettling parts of King's writing.<br/><br/>Casting John Cusack was a brilliant idea. Not since roles like his turn in THE GRIFTERS has he gotten the chance to work with a character and a scenario that lets him explore such a wide range of emotional states. Not to mention that he provides us with something of a rarity these days in horror films - a three-dimensional hero who you actually give a damn about, and find yourself rooting for when the odds get as stacked against him as mind-bendingly possible. <br/><br/>And though Sam Jackson's role in 1408 is so short that it would be considered an insult to his fans in any other film, for his role a little bit goes a long way, and he makes the most of his turn as the mysterious Mr. Olin...who has an agenda all his own in getting Mike Enslin into what has to be the most evil and most haunted room in the world. <br/><br/>While I'm at it, mention must be made of a quick but terrifyingly effective cameo from stage and screen vet Len Cariou. With just the way he said a single line, that alone left more egg- sized goosebumps on my forearms than the top three slasher series combined. Talk about less being more? Mr. Cariou makes it into an art form.<br/><br/>Which reminds me - you can't forget the most important character of all...1408 itself. A place more terrible and insidious than probably any other of Stephen King's creations, not because of its reputation, but because of how it earned that reputation. There's evil, and possession, and the trapped and tormented spirits of the dead stuck between worlds. And then there's something just a little worse than that...<br/><br/>But why spoil the surprises for you? Every element that goes into the creation of a great horror movie AND a psychological thriller is here. All you have to do is step in with Mike Enslin, close the door behind you, and see where things go...if your nerves can handle it!"

Apparently writing about having seen no ghosts doesn't sell many books, either, which may explain why there are so many authors that apparently see them, and not many that don't.<br/><br/>After the initial setup, which was very well paced, there is the (basically) one and only scene with Samuel L. Jackson, who must have been able to film all of his parts in a single day. That's a shame, too, because he has a great deal of screen presence, and the parts he is in are very effective.<br/><br/>Then begins the roller-coaster ride of scary things that go bump in the night. This is done a *lot* better than I expected, and there is quite a bit of frenetic energy in this scare-a-thon.<br/><br/>And then... the movie basically just ends. It is almost like they weren't sure what to do, and just flipped the switch. The final scene with his wife seemed tacked on.

I rented this film but it will definitely be on my Christmas list this year and someone else's if they rub me up the wrong way. lol. I'm not going to describe any part of this film as you really have to watch it to appreciate it. Truly Harrowing, Truly Remarkable."

","Not one of Kings best stories and certainly not one of the best film adaptations of one of his books. Very silly,not frightening ,predictable overall a very boring horror flick that eventually becomes preposterous. I couldn't give any spoilers because the viewer will soon realise quite quickly into the movie that they have seen it all before. I haven't seen a decent film in ages and its getting frustrating,mind you i knew that this would be garbage anyway.There has not Benn a truly frightening movie for years ,perhaps i am getting old(hang on i am) I scored it a 5 ,now come to think of it i am being very silly,cos i gave no country 3!!! and thats unfair,i going to swap the scores."

","This film really surprised me as the only reason I went to see it was because I'd missed the film I had intended to see in the first place.<br/><br/>Stephen King is renowned for some great films such as the Green Mile. However, some of his films have been very disappointing such as The Secret Window and Dreamcatcher. So when I bought my tickets to go see 1408, I didn't really know what to expect, especially since no-one I knew had been to see it and I had no reviews.<br/><br/>The basic plot is the story of an ageing paranormal investigator turned Author who is famed for writing books about ghost finding hotels and spots in the US. After receiving an anonymous postcard from the Dolphin Hotel, he decides to spend a night in room 1408 with terrifying results.<br/><br/>This film really scared me! It has a good blend of pscycological and physical scares which is quite hard to achieve.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays the role of a strong and narrow-minded fighter losing a battle of sanity with great integrity.<br/><br/>John Cusack at his best.<br/><br/>A good horror film. Recommended for those who plan a night in with a good horror."

","Mike Enslin, a confirmed cynic, has made his living by staying in haunted hotels and then writing about them. He receives an anonymous postcard from the Dolphin Hotel in New York. The postcard simply states, ""Do not enter 1408."" Despite various warnings, chiefly from the Hotel's Manager, Gerald Olin, Mike Enslin enters 1408.<br/><br/>1408 is the creepiest film I have seen in quite some time. In the first twenty minutes, nothing much happens in terms of scares. The first few scenes of the movie allow you to get to know the central character, which is a very good plot device for any horror movie. After all, if an audience doesn't care about the star, they will not bat an eye during his ever- increasing torment. John Cusack portrays the character of Mike Enslin with gusto. Cusack, brings to life an individual who is funny, cynical, and on the brink of becoming an alcoholic.<br/><br/>When Enslin meets Gerald Olin (a slick and subtle performance by Samuel L. Jackson), Olin tries his best to convince Enslin not to stay in 1408. But, of course, this only intrigues Enslin more, and he is determined to spend the night there.<br/><br/>When Enslin crosses the threshold of 1408, the pace of the movie steps up a notch. From that point on, the audience is treated to a bombardment of either subtle psychological mind games or violent, in-your-face, shockers. However, the tension does tend to dissipate a few times during the movie. I don't think ghosts should ever be seen in clear focus, walking slowly around a haunted room. And Enslin's descent into mania becomes a bit too frenzied at times.<br/><br/>There is nothing very original in 1408. The movie uses some of the classic horror movie tricks. Long camera angles, references to the number 13, loud bangs, and flashing images are all utilized. But I can forgive 1408 for using these obvious scare tactics, because they have been melded together to create the best possible impact and certainly will have a lot of the audience on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>In conclusion, despite the slight lapses in tension and a lack of any real originality 1408 is destined to become a classic horror movie. In my opinion, it is the spookiest film produced since Blair Witch."

","Most of us must be sick of watching all the mindless horror movies in recent times and along comes 1408 for the rescue.<br/><br/>Its very neatly done with a smooth pace. Esp. The build up they give for the first half was simply real scary. If you are not sure on what I'm talking about, try watching this movie alone in the night and you will know how this movie can cast great fear on your mind. In my opinion, thats the way you get the most of the horror movies, watch it alone and your mind will add up thrill to the top.<br/><br/>The performances from Cussac and Samuel is also good.<br/><br/>I have always been a big fan of Stephen King and for a while thought he was fading off but this movie said it all. He is Still at the top of his form. Watch this and you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>I would easily rate this as one of the best horror movies I have ever seen."
"eirenightshade","8","1","2","31 January 2008"," A Psychological Joyride
","1408 was a solid, conclusive film. It succeeded in being a great psychological thriller because it veered into much more intelligent and introspective scenes than your run-of-the-mill films like Saw or Hostel. This isn't a movie seething with blood and gore, but even more to its credit than that is the fact that it also doesn't try too hard NOT to be within the same genre as those gore-horror movies, so the outcome isn't overdone to the point of being tacky and pitifully ""artsy."" You won't find any shaky camera scenes or other overstated camera tricks thrown in here. This is a wonderful homage to purer times; back when we still had to use our imaginations when watching movies. Unfortunately we live in a day and age where most films spell everything out for you so you are spoonfed a mediocre story that basically does all the thinking for you...this film lets you think. It lets you understand the very basic bits of information (i.e. that the room is basically driving this man mad), but the chills, thrills, and spine-tingling moments are all perpetuated by your OWN sense of paranoia and your own sense of fear, rather than going along with situations that have already been dictated to you.<br/><br/>As for the story; it was enjoyable. Not stunningly original, but stylish and still fresh. You will get the feeling at various times throughout the movie that you have seen certain things before; and certainly they are standards of several classic Stephen King stories, but I think of that more as Stephen King's personal trademark rather than the writers resting on their laurels by adding touches that have worked well in the past. I wasn't impressed with the underlying story of Mike's past, particularly his daughter coming back to haunt him. I felt like it was thrown in to add something touching, but it detracted from the feel of the movie rather than adding the bit of humanity I suspect was its purpose. Overall, it was a chilling, excellently told film. The story itself in not a new one; but John Cusack's perfect performance, a good story that didn't veer off and lose you with too much new age imagery, and an expertly creepy feel set off by a truly bone chilling soundtrack was the perfect mix. Truth be told, if I was sleeping alone tonight, I would be lying awake and more than a little uneasy about being alone in the dark...especially with a clock radio by the bed. And I don't consider myself a person who gets rattled easily. Mission accomplished. Highly recommend."
"khemass","8","1","2","27 January 2008"," Reminding me of real nightmares
","This film is a good thrill ride. It builds up fear and tension very well without using too much blood. I like the way it slowly makes us scared of this room by let us hear the story about it first. I also like the way it creates a world of nightmare where anything can happen and then disappears and then changes into something else. It's like getting locked in Hell and you can never escape even when you thought you already have.<br/><br/>I have had nightmares before and I must say that this film present something very, very similar to them. A world where you can never escape and the horrible thing in them came from the depth of darkness in your heart.<br/><br/>However, the film drags a bit in the second half. Too many things happen at the same and without a break. Also,the story doesn't really give any significant message. If it has a theme, then it fails to deliver that theme, because I didn't learn anything. It was just a good scary movie that tells you how things in your head can haunt you like hell. I didn't like the ending. It was a bit confusing what the movie tries to say at the last scene.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this one for anybody who enjoy psycho-horror films. I wasn't disappointed. This movie kept my heart beating and my eyes staring at the screen the whole way through."
"aesgaard41","10","1","2","23 January 2008"," Interesting and Compelling King
","Whenever I go into a ghost movie, I go into it playing ghost hunter and paranormal detective. My mind is always in ""Yes, that's happened,"" ""Aw, come on..."" and ""Would never happen."" Hollywood rarely gets it right when it comes to trying to depict the supernatural, and when it's Stephen King, reality goes out the window. King may be inspired by the paranormal, but he generally brings your worst fears to life. In his latest movie venture, John Cusack plays a writer with a past over his head who doesn't believe in ghosts and goes around exposing them with pure cynicism with the artful styling of a seasoned writer. When he heads to Room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel, he is there to challenge it, but it proves to challenge him. Samuel L. Jackson plays the elegant yet austere hotel manager with all the pomp and grace of the grim reaper trying to talk him out of it. It's never explained just who sent the post card that sends Cusack to the hotel: the manager trolling for victims or the spirit of his dead daughter trying to warn him. Both Cusack and Jackson give intense roles, and the haunting activity and Cusack's rambling soliloquy and flashbacks keeps it from becoming too claustrophobic. In the end, even the audience feels trapped in the room. It's an excellent movie of the supernatural as explained by and deciphered by the mind of Stephen King. It's definitely worth a watch as long as you look for all the references to the number thirteen."
"ivanrojas","7","1","2","6 January 2008"," Over the average
","In some way, John Cusack manages to cast always in over the average films, and the most curious detail is that the movies are from many different types, but he plays always the same type of character. <br/><br/>1408 is not a piece of art, but keeps you interested until the end. It does not scares me as I have been in others films, but maybe this is because the main role tries all the movie to stay himself sane, and you as an spectator, try to be with him in this quest.<br/><br/>The music, photography and the rest of the casting is OK. <br/><br/>The plot has few missed lines (who sent the postcard?, what happened to the hotel manager?), but in general, if you play under the terms of the story, you can enjoy the mystery and mainly with John Cusack's performance."
"Tomici","7","1","2","6 January 2008"," One hell of a horror movie!!!
","I'm big fan of Stephen King and I must say that this is one of the best King's adaptations since the Storm of the century. The truth is that I have already seen one horror movie (if I remember correctly the movie was Drowning ghost) from this director and I didn't had some great expectations about this movie - well I was very wrong.<br/><br/>This is one of the movies that are very rare today - movie that will keep you in tension from the beginning till the end. John's and Jackson's acting was great and they are the main reason why this movie is so good. That speech Jackson made in the beginning of the movie was stunning. And yes, the movie is not perfect, but which horror movie today is? This one maybe has some pointless scenes, but it kept me on the edge of my seat till the end. It's definitely better than a lot's of other Hollywood crap movies we unfortunately watch these days.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for some good suspense horror movie, go and see it. I can tell you one thing for sure - it is worth checking in."
"phantomfox24","9","1","2","3 January 2008"," The Worst Stephen King Adaption
","This was by far the worst Stephen King adaption ever. That's not to say the movie was bad, quite the contrary, but it had little connection between the short story, Characters and some phrases aside, and the movie. Thats very good though as I found the book a little lacklustre while the movie was masterful. The plot was much more involving and much more involved. The characters seemed more like real people. I particularly enjoyed how the room itself looked much normal and unassuming than any hotel room You'll ever stay in. Also the lighting in the film was amazing and reflected moods, as well as accentuate the rising drama and horror. One of the best part of the films didn't even come from the dialog but from their expressions and the tone of their voices. The actors in this paint a believable as well as a beautiful portrait. A definite must see for horror fans or just people looking for a gripping and engaging story this is it."
"masterjk2","2","1","2","29 December 2007"," Utterly stupid
","Well, Cusack was good, most of the time. That ends the good news. For people who can't write, this was brilliant. Imagine, a dream world in which one never knows whether it's a dream or ""reality."" Such is the stuff of nightmares, particularly if you paid good money to see it. Plots, well written ones anyway, require some logic. This movie had none. A lot of special effects that were well done, but the director could have added anything and it would have been as logical as what he did add. A hodge podge of montages, with one silly thing after another. When things go creepy, there has to be some reason behind it. And when things happen, there needs to be a reason for that also. We see a lot of random things happen for no reason. So we're just supposed to sit back and take it. Ugh. True, there was no real gore and that beats movies at the other end of the scale which have nothing but. But a plot would have been nice...this endless hit in the head with a surf board, all a dream, all reality, all fantasy nonsense is for people with no real sense of good story telling. King should be ashamed to have allowed his name to be used in conjunction with this piece of tripe. Surely his short story was better written. If it wasn't, he better retire to the farm and milk cows, instead of money out of ridiculous plot lines."

"mrnemmers","5","1","2","19 December 2007"," Poor Translation
","I'm a purist, so please keep that in mind when reading this review.<br/><br/>If you've read (or listened to) King's short story in either ""Blood and Smoke"" or ""Everything's Eventual,"" then you will probably be disappointed with the movie. The old saying, ""The book's always better"" couldn't be more true with regards to the screen adaptation of 1408.<br/><br/>First of all, a take on the choice of actors. Samuel L. Jackson, while undoubtedly a brilliant actor in his own right, is mis-cast as Mr. Olin, the manager of the Hotel Dolphin. He's too strong a presence on screen and the ""pudgy little hotel manager"" who loses his ""personal magnetism"" when out of his office in the story is lost on such a powerful actor. To better capture the essence of the written story, Wayne Knight (Seinfeld's ""Newman"") would've been a better choice, in my view. John Cusak as Mike Enslin, however, was a perfect match.<br/><br/>The dialogue that takes place in the written version between Enslin and Olin at the beginning of the story really sets the pace for what's to come, and while movie did a so-so job of capturing that tension and foreboding in their exchange it could've been a lot better. Instead of keeping Enslin and Olin conversating longer in the office, thereby building the tension even more, a sub-plot is added to fill the space in which Enslin sees his dead daughter and a ghost of himself communicating via teleconference with his estranged wife. While this is in keeping with many of King's bizarre stories, I felt it was a little out of place and things from the original -- such as a longer scene in Olin's office -- would've made for a better script.<br/><br/>The time Enslin spends in Room 1408 is a bit creepy in the style of the old Suspense radio plays of the 40's & 50's, but his experiences are nothing like those in the book. Also, his mini-corder and the comments he records on them play a big part in the story, but it's completely downplayed by what's happening. The storyline is almost...well, boring. It has its moments, but I don't think the direction they went with it is in keeping with the spirit of horror Enslin experiences in the written version.<br/><br/>If you're a die-hard Stephen King movie fan, you'll probably like this movie. However, if you've read/listed to the story in it's original form, I think you'll find it a bit tedious and pedantic."
"Bluwulfyre","6","1","2","7 December 2007"," Imaginative and Thoughtful
","A warning to those who want to see blood and gore in this movie: sorry, you've come to the wrong place. What we have here in 1408 is an intriguing exploration of the stability of the human mind in a man's struggle to overcome his own 'inner demons' or at least, that was the general interpretation within my group. There are no overly graphic, bloody scenes of the macabre and ghastly and instead, I'd recommend going into this film without expecting that. <br/><br/>There is a fair measure of conventional shocks and thrills though, ones that pleasantly occur without warning which is a welcome change to the more common things you see in the mainstream. While the horror isn't really emphasized the film manages to compensate for it by the well-crafted progression of the main character's descent into madness so to speak. Although the somewhat lackluster acting of John Cusack left something to be desired and Samuel L. Jackson played the creepy hotel manager well but seemed to be a little too one- dimensional. <br/><br/>Things did start to deteriorate somewhat though in the latter half of the film and it felt like it was dragging at some points. However the musical score was brilliant and accompanied the scenes' atmosphere quite well, building tension at the right moments though more would have been nice. Tension was something that needed to be upped throughout the film so that by the end the audience would be sitting on the edge of their seats, heart pounding in excitement and fear, nerves frayed to breaking point...but unfortunately that wasn't something I felt. <br/><br/>Now I did mention in the summary that it was imaginative and thoughtful. Why, you ask? Well, because despite anything else I have said, the best thing about 1408 is that it has scenes which are just out of this world (the ghost of the daughter crumbling into rubble sticks out in my mind the most) and not something you see every day. Of course, what else can you expect when the source material comes from Stephen King?) <br/><br/>Go see this movie with an open mind because that's the best way you're going to enjoy it."

This movie is a must watch for all scare lovers. For those who loved ""horror movies"" like 30 days of night it will show them what horror is.

","The best since ""The Shining""? Just might be. I read that this is the only selection that Stephen King has re-read that scared him. Watching the film, I can see why. It is a horror story that makes your blood run cold. Samuel L. Jackson's part is small but effective. He has that air of respectability and the demeanor of a guy who sits in a large expensively furnished office of a major hotel and perhaps, might have a fondness for sending postcards. Jackson was a nice touch. Cusack's character is believable, likable, and of course, stubborn as a donkey. The third trait gets his rear end into serious trouble. We can all exhibit that sort of mulishness at times and knowing when to listen to someone can be the best way to prevent disaster. If he had this knowledge, there would be no story. And everyone loves a good story. I'm also looking forward to ""The Mist"" and ""Pet Sematary"". King's bucks just keep rolling in and I can't say he doesn't earn them."

","I've been a fan of John Cusack from as far back as ""Better Off Dead"". John's ability to live a part, to really go with it, no matter how corny, no matter how lame, no matter how trite, no matter how cliché, (not many actors could pull off ""Being John Malkovich"", for instance,) is amazing. So when a movie comes along that isn't corny, lame, trite or cliché, it's a double-bonus to have John in it! I felt that way with ""The Ice Harvest"", and I feel the same about ""1408"". With so many miserable movie flops of good works by Stephen King, I wasn't expecting much,and, frankly, was worried that Hollywood might make a movie with Cusack in it I didn't like. However, they did a superb job with creating an atmosphere of terror and suspense, and not screwing it up by yanking you out of the moment with lame dialog for the trailers (save perhaps for ""It's an evil f***ing room"") or by making the effects more important than the story. They even managed to surprise me with the ending. Even though I didn't fall for the drowning setup (too easy,) I still didn't know where they were taking me until it was done. Thanks, guys, for keeping my eyes glued on the screen for a wonderful 94 minutes."
"carolyns_world","6","1","2","28 October 2007"," The movie had potential, but only offered cheap thrills.
","I'm not a fan when it comes to other people telling me how a movie is or what other people had said. I rented 1408 disregarding what other people had told me, which was usually this : 'Well I heard it wasn't that good'. But I decided to see for myself.<br/><br/>The movie starts off steadily, we can quickly understand the main character, Mike Enslin (John Cusack), is a writer who has written a bunch of scary books that were mediocre at best. Throughout the movie the viewer develops a better sense of Mike Enslin's personal life and his struggles he has faced throughout his life. He decides to check in to room 1408 where his personal, inner demons come out and taunt him, along with some other ghastly sights.<br/><br/>But please, don't stop reading there.<br/><br/>I anticipated a lot of suspense, a lot of mystery, and quite frankly, a good scare. All of this was possible but didn't show through in the movie. It's a shame that a novel from a distinguished author such as Steven King was poorly portrayed in '1408'. All the 'scary' parts were cheap and short lasting. The aura of suspense quickly turns into boredom as you are waiting for some development throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was meant to display the psychological and mental that Mike Enslin goes through in room 1408, the problem is that the audience fails to associate with that mental torture. I couldn't empathize with the character, and thought that the acting could have been better. Sammuel L. Jackson created a fine performance. John Cusack started off really well, but as soon as he steps into that room he fails to convince me that he is scared, hence I am not. A lot of his acting was limited because the majority of the time he was talking into is tape recorder. It distracts from the action of the movie.<br/><br/>Also, the storyline has so many unanswered questions. You don't get a sense of what is going on. Okay, I suppose you could argue 'well isn't that the whole idea of a scary, suspenseful, movie?' Yes, it is, but there are too many unanswered questions at the end that defeat the whole purpose of the ghostly inhabitants or 'personal demons' of that room.<br/><br/>The music was very good. I won't say it was perfect, but it had it's perks.<br/><br/>Camera angles give you headaches, but to the director's credit, that evened out toward the end. Still, I wish the director thought twice about where he put the camera. Perhaps he was trying to create an aura of confusion...or maybe he had no idea what the hell he was doing.<br/><br/>If you are trying to watch this movie for a scare - do not. This movie will tug some strings in your heart, but will fail to disturb your soul."

","This is the story of a cynical John Cusack, who travels the country visiting places that advertise in ""spookiness"" and then writes about them in books like ""The Top 10 Haunted Hotels"", but he doesn't personally believe in anything supernatural. One day he checks into room ""1408"" and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>What he experiences in 1408 is a montage of your average horror flick scares, mixed with a bit of what's real and what's not and spiced up with a little dive into the depths of a tormented soul. Nothing too special though. Only a handful of original ideas, the rest is business as usual.<br/><br/>The movie should have been 30 minutes shorter. The ending is, unsurprisingly for Stephen King, not satisfying. John Cusack is being just his usual self, you either like him or not. I do. As I liked Samuel L. Jacksons rather brief appearances.<br/><br/>All in all, if you don't watch too many films or play lots of video games, it might strike you as original and refreshing and you'll maybe like it. Veterans of the psycho horror genre will probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 5/10: Average."

","1408 was a bright film. The use of special effects made the story come to life. The movie starts out slow but sets up for a complex plot. I found the use of the post card to send to Mike Enslin the start of the room attracting him in. This also leads into the background around the room and the staffs fear of this room. the room is feared by the whole staff. The handy man won't walk into the room and the manager of the hotel refuses to have anyone stay there. the only way they figured out how to stay in the room was by a law saying that they must give him the room if it is available. The room itself is a beast. It screams confusion from the point of entering. The room has a mind of its own. It can first send slashers after you or freak you out by ghosts of the people who jumped out of the window. The room also has the ability of changing into any environment. One minute you are in a bathroom the next your dead daughter comes out of nowhere to confront you. One ironic theme that presented itself was the radio turning on and singing ""its only just begun"". This phrase can summarize the whole movie. Whenever I thought the movie was over it jumps back into the plot. This movie twist and turns the viewer and grabs you until the end. I found the movie kind of short though and would have rather seen more events about the room but the conclusion to the movie is to die for and if you start it make sure you finish. Overall this movie shows the greatness in Steven King and how his books can convert to movie easily. it is one of the best scary movies I have ever seen. So go see 1408. It is perfect for a Holloween fright and there isn't much gore."

Looking back on myself, I did not want to see this movie because it John Cusack in it. He is a good actor, better than his sister Joan. I was really wrong about him this time. The movie is based off of a short story in the book Nightmares and Dreamscapes, which tells the story of a paranormal investigator/author, who is recently divorced and lost his daughter, checking into a room with a very grisly past. A skeptic at first, he quickly learns the horrible haunts and pains that this room holds. I will say this, it is genius how Mikael Håfström approached this and created a whole movie inside a hotel room. The set, with looks like it came from a Broadway play, was masterfully done and really stayed true to the book's description.<br/><br/>John Cusack really established himself as a great actor. His performance in this movie was nothing short of brilliant and perfect. Though in the beginning of the movie he is sort of stale and kind of tired, he quickly takes a swan dive into madness once the room starts mindscrew him. His performance is believable even when he becomes emotionally damaged when he sees his dead daughter. Samuel L. Jackson who we all know from Snakes does not overdue his character to point of ridiculousness. He does not have that big of a role but more of a supporting character, and for his magnitude is just right. He is in plenty other movies where he is perfect for a main character, this one he is just fine as a supporting character. He adds a sort of charisma to the hotel manager, who is seldom, calm, very proper and persistent. If it weren't for the emotions, the movie probably would be just another haunted house story.<br/><br/>For a PG-13, this movie had some pretty good scares, but the main ""scare tactic"" was not jump out scare, which it had, but more psychological scares. Granted, the jump-out scare worked effectively, especially in enclosed areas and dark open areas but psychologically you never know what is real and what is not and that is the biggest scare out of the whole movie. Only SK and Håfström could make a radio seem so creepy, which they did perfectly. The room also plays horrible emotional tricks on our protagonist and at one point you feel for him, especially since the room is just playing games on him. I think that his movie is very different from some of the SK adaptations for these exact reasons, and this movie is definitely a must-see for any SK fan or horror fan."

","Could anyone tell me what's the last ""good"" movie based on a Stephen King story?? i am a big fan of Stephen King's work but sadly most of his works are poorly adapted to the screen but amazingly, Swedish director Mikael Håfström did a great job translating King's short story into the screen creating the most atmospheric and chilling horror movie in years and not forgetting the remarkably intense performance of John Cusack who carried the whole movie on his shoulder.. also the music by Gabriel Yared is so powerful and gave the movie unease feeling while you are watching, Samuel L. Jackson has a small but effective role as the Dolphin hotel manager..... i am not going through the plot of the movie, but it's a great horror movie with decent scare jumps, enjoy watching it.."
"Aaron1375","9","1","2","6 October 2007"," Room 1408, holds you in never letting go.
","This movie had me hooked rather quickly as the John Cusak character's job of writing about haunted places was very interesting. He goes into an old bed and breakfast place and does what he normally does and goes about his business. One day though he receives a post card that simply states a hotel's name and a warning, don't go into room 1408. Of course, being a writer of haunted places he is now compelled to go into this one. Once he arrives he is greeted by the hotel manager played very well by Samuel Jackson. They have a great conversation where Jackson's character tries everything to get our curious writer to reconsider staying in the room, a room where there are many deaths as no one has ever apparently survived an hour. Well the writer goes and at the start there is nothing really all that out of the ordinary. However, little things start to happen and before you know it spooks and such begin to appear, the room seems to be holding the writer prisoner and you begin to question what is real, or what is happening and if the writer has any chance of escaping. I was kind of relieved when he was ready to leave after the one incident, as I would have found it hard to believe anyone would not be spooked after the window and hand thing. The movie goes at a good pace and keeps you guessing, I was happy about the ending too, as I thought the sort of predictable scene that looked like the ending was going to be it. This room will take a hold of you, hopefully you can escape its grasp."
"luvkittys7","9","1","2","6 October 2007"," Dang! Now that was a GOOD MOVIE!
","I must say that it is very hard for me to sit through an entire movie, due to my ADD. For this reason, I rarely go the theaters and I always tape things off TV so I can fast forward through the commercials and come and go from the movie at will. That being said, I sat through this entire movie, in an uncomfortable chair, thirsty as heck, without out blinking, or getting up once for a glass of water.. This movie made me laugh. It made me cry. But most importantly... it scared the crap out of me!!! Much different from traditional horror movies, it showed true Stephen King style. But unlike most of SK's books brought to the screen-this one actually managed to portray that mad and somehow KNOWING horror that Stephen King is so good at scaring us with. All I can say is WELL DONE!!"
"Slickflix","7","1","2","5 October 2007"," One Evil Room
","Hollywood loves Stephen King. His work has seen numerous adaptations, mostly in the form of films and mini-series. Unfortunately, for every successful adaptation, we are subject to about ten poor ones. In thirty years his literature has gone through nearly 100 screen adaptations, only a fraction of which have been satisfactory. The dramas ""Stand by me"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are widely considered to be the best adaptations of King's work. Genre filmmakers David Cronenberg and John Carpenter saw success with their film adaptations, as did masters Stanley Kubrick and Brian De Palma. Outside of those films, most of King's films have ranged from moderate to mediocre. ""1408"", based on a short story by King, is among the better works.<br/><br/>John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a once respected author who has been reduced to writing schlock for years. It's a role tailor made for Cusack, with all of his trademark wit and cynicism. Since falling into his slump, Enslin has made ends meet writing stuff like ""10 Haunted Graveyards"", and ""10 Haunted Cemeteries"". His latest work, entitled you guessed it ""10 Haunted Hotels"", has Mike traveling the country to investigate the most infamous haunted hotel rooms. Unfortunately for him, every room turns out to be an over-hyped disappointment. So when gets word about ""1408"", the haunted room in New York's luxurious ""Dolphin Hotel"", Enslin is immediately skeptical. Who cares that 56 people have died in that room over the years, rooms aren't haunted. Right? Like Mike, I was a bit skeptical going into ""1408"". How scary can a movie about a haunted hotel room be? Well, color me surprised. Director Mikael Hafstrom and his screenwriters have crafted a very effective thriller. What starts as a boring night in 1408 for Enslin, slowly becomes a nightmare of genuine terror and madness. Subtle creeps slowly escalate to a desperate fight to stay alive.<br/><br/>The movie owes a lot of its success to John Cusack, who is on screen for about 99% of the picture. His ability to identify with viewers while commanding the screen with his sharp performance is key to the success of ""1408"". That, combined with effective direction and smart screen writing, makes this a refreshing little thriller that doesn't rely on the over-the-top gore of most of today's horror."
"oneloveall","5","1","2","30 September 2007"," Entertaining but unsatisfying....the clichés of exploiting subjectivity
","1408 is a decent enough psychological horror film that benefits from an exciting pace, attractive ambiance, and an unusually unhinged (though slightly over-the-top in a hammed out way) performance from Cusack. However, when battling it out in the final stretch, this mental exercise is exhausted with the constant plot-twists hardly adding up to anything more then...constant plot-twists. It is as if the third act of this hellish premise was so determined to continuously pull successive sheets off of our confused faces for further revelatory excitement that the conclusion just ends up feeling silly, contrived, and will likely end up leaving many viewers apathetic to the previous hour of entertaining suspense."
"fedor8","Null","1","2","28 September 2007"," Am I hallucinating or is it Cusack? A good movie based on King's material??
","This is one of the most fun horror films to come out in recent years. Set mostly in a hotel suite, it is never dull, slickly directed, and a great ride. There are even a twist or two, which is amazing considering that King, the King of Predictability, wrote the story this is based on.<br/><br/>This is only the second time - since Kubrick's phenomenal ""The Shining"" - that a movie based on a Stephen King book or story turns out very good. It took nearly three decades for it to happen, but here it is. My guess is that the story was re-written in a major way (that is to say improved), and/or that the script-writer is very bright i.e. capable of turning crap into gold, which is a rare talent.<br/><br/>Take a look at Mary McCormack's new lips. She looks like a frog. Her plastic surgeon should have his license revoked."
"richard_sleboe","6","1","2","24 September 2007"," Pascal got it wrong
","Blaise Pascal said all human misery was ultimately due to man's inability to stay in his room by himself. After watching ""1408"", I guess he wouldn't be so sure. The basic plot idea closely resembles Star Trek TNG episode ""Remember Me"": People start disappearing from the Enterprise until Doctor Crusher is all by herself. Finally, the universe shrinks to nothing but the size of the ship. In ""1408"", once mystery hack Mike Enslin checks into the Dolphin Hotel, the room becomes his world, and soon the world is nothing but his room. The story isn't any more original than Mike Enslin's very own trashy paperbacks, but Mikael Håfström has three things going for his movie. One, it may be a one-man show, but that's alright when that one man is John Cusack. Two, some images stick with you for days, such as Enslin's mirror image in a room across the street or the limitless expanse of the hotel's exterior brick wall. Three, who would want to miss the guest appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as the hotel's glib, yet obliging general manager?"
"luke-346","5","1","2","22 September 2007"," It's not awful... but it really should be better!
","In what has, allegedly, been perceived as an interesting concept for a horror in a time when contemporary and commercial American cinema seems to be offering nothing more than ""torture trash"", is in fact not that interesting. This is mainly due to the fact that once intellectual logic is applied, the film flounders. Overall 1408 fails in its attempt to offer the acceptable psychological horror that has so often been associated with Stephen King adaptations, and it is for precisely this reason that many will feel let down.<br/><br/>Those familiar with this genre will however notice the inventive and directorial aspects that make the film stand apart (most notably the drawn out scenes in which our anticipation is ridden on the basis of genre clichés and the claustrophobic nature so brilliantly conveyed via the imaginative use of surrealist imagery). 1408 is not awful, but it should be brilliant and unfortunately it is not"
"shivdas99","9","1","2","16 September 2007"," In the same league as Jacobs ladder, the Machinist and Memento
","Firstly there are two main characters in this movie and the movie totally relies on these two main characters - 1408 the room and John Cusack. It is all about the interplay between these 2 central characters mentally and physically. So thank god Cusack acted to the hefty acting ability the nature of this movie demands.<br/><br/>Secondly what is the definition of a horror movie these days? Good looking teenagers being chased by a stranger from an isolated part of the remote country? Lots of blood and the occasional jump and scream? Yes. Because in a generation of hostels and saws no one gets scared or disturbed in the true sense of the word. Everyone is just disgusted or shocked because of the gravity of the torture and the deaths. There is no pharmacologically effect brought, only a display a guts. 1408 is a hopefully the start of a fresh wave of horrors.<br/><br/>Lastly i hope this movie makes you think. It is not just a horror but almost in the same league of the machinist, memento, spider and Jacobs ladder. The movie is dealing with a man whose lost his daughter, has a tricky relationship with his wife and has human qualities like arrogance and selfishness. We are dealing with a human here.<br/><br/>Watch this."

There was nothing very scary, but I must say that this film kept me on the edge all the time. John Cusack did a fine job in portraying his fear, helplessness and desperation. Towards the ending, I was so disappointed by the fact that he got out of the hotel room just like that, I thought the film could not have ended worse. Then, a surprise twist revived the story and made it even more thrilling! There were several plot holes in the film, but it was still enjoyable to watch."
"davideo-2","7","1","2","6 September 2007"," There have been far worse King adaptations, for sure, but still a bit over-rated
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a cynical writer who tries to debunk popular ghost stories and myths with his novels. But he has one more to crack- a room in an old New York hotel called 1408, which has been plagued with stories of murder, suicide and creepy happenings. The hotel owner Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) desperately tries to convince him not to go ahead with it, but Mike won't be satisfied until he's tried it for himself. To begin with, it all seems like he suspected, a big hoax, but then creepy happenings do begin, and he's confronted with events from his own past that drive him to the brink of insanity.<br/><br/>Stephen King sets a lot of his books in his home town of Bangor, Maine. Other fans of his work may not have noticed this, but I've always felt that this setting has added to the sense of creepiness and tension of his stories. But what's this??? New York??? Somehow, a hotel room in the Big Apple hasn't got quite the same impact as somewhere as enclosed as Maine. It's a great place to set a horror story. I myself have always felt a weird sense of tension if I stay alone overnight in an old hotel room in somewhere like Cornwall for some reason, but setting is everything and New York, well...<br/><br/>Cusack has received a lot of praise for his performance in the lead role, and he does try his best, even if his constantly being distracted by The Carpenters's We've Only Just Begun comically reminded me of Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. Other scenes that were meant to add to the scare factor, like his hand getting hit by a closing window and a tap bursting in his face, also lead to some unintentional amusement. Jackson is his usual steely, stern self in the supporting role and the rest of the supporting cast are also pretty good.<br/><br/>The first short story to be adapted from King's Everything's Eventual novel, this has a lot of good ideas floating around in it as well as some strong performances and a few neat scare scenes. But the story feels awfully disjointed and without a solid, firm foundation to hold your interest through-out and King's robbed it of his familiar, neat sense of claustrophobia by switching settings to somewhere so wide, colourful and populated. There are far, far worse adaptations of his work out there, of course, but of the few that get praise anything above pretty good, personally I didn't think this was one of them. ***"
"dbborroughs","7","1","2","26 August 2007"," Great Hollywood horror, a rare find these days
","Don't watch this just before you go to bed. The movie hung with me and I rally didn't sleep, not because I was scared rather I didn't want my head to end up in a 1408 existence.<br/><br/>The plot has John Cusack as a writer of horror guide books (10 haunted lighthouses) who goes to a hotel in new York and stays in room 1408 where people either die or go insane or both. Cusack is certain there is nothing to the stories, of course he finds out otherwise.<br/><br/>Creepy horror story thats one of the better Hollywood horror movies in years. It helps not to be a remake or a complete retread like most of the recent crap we've been subjected to recently. A genuine horror movie as opposed to one of the thrillers (Disturbia, Vacancy, etc) where things do bump in the night and ghosts do seem to walk. I liked this movie a great deal. Its not the be all and end all of horror movies but it is a nice creepy little distractions.<br/><br/>If there are any real flaws to the film they are minor. There is perhaps a bit too many effects, the scariest moments are the ones with out them. Also the casting of John Cusack, while very good on the face of it, distracts from the sense that this is a real hotel and events happening to a real person. It doesn't diminish the scares, except perhaps that you know on some level there will be a suitable ending. (I could almost argue that Samuel l Jackson, in what amounts to a cameo, is too Hollywood as well except that his presence and delivery, especially of the ""Its an evil f#%$ing room"" line that adds a great deal of weight to what follows. I don't know if the movie would have been as frightening with out his dire warnings)"
"Protilius","9","1","2","26 August 2007"," What horror should be...
","I saw ""1408"" recently and have to say this was a breath of fresh air compared to the typical horror escapades I've been seeing in circulation lately. <br/><br/>The main character is a journalist that investigates the paranormal. A man not without his own share of tragedy to draw character from, John does an excellent job in his performance as room 1408 reveals it's true nature to our skeptical main character. <br/><br/>Note worthy moments were the dialog between Mr.Jackson as the Hotel manager and John himself as the freelance paranormal journalist/writer. I was entertained to see two such cool actors go head to head with they're own agenda's, it made for a great prelude to actually entering room 1408 and built the momentum well. <br/><br/>Once entering the room, things start off seemingly dismissive and uneventful, but 1408 soon makes it very clear that John is no longer a guest to the hotel... but more so a prisoner by the room's choosing. <br/><br/>A prisoner subject to it's trickery and madness as the story progresses into the depths of insanity. <br/><br/>1408 was a great movie... Go see it. You'll be pleased with the experience as a whole if you have any appreciation for the unexplained or supernatural... You'll also be pleased that unlike other horrors, they don't rely on wet-works and blood props to tell the story, somebody actually took the time to write out a decent script for this one.<br/><br/>Cheers:)"
"lyvewyer","8","1","2","25 August 2007"," refreshingly chilling
","It's been a while since I've seen a movie that was able to draw me in and genuinely unsettle me. 1408 manages to do this. Though at times relying on ""old-hat"" spooks to drive the plot, there are more than enough inventive deliveries of the movie's abundant chills to keep you watching. John Cusack delivers a solid performance and carries the movie almost completely by himself. And just when you thought it was safe, just when you had convinced yourself that it was impossible; there is no way that Cusack can have a scene where he is being rained on in this movie, the fire sprinklers turn on, soaking him. Priceless. All in all, a definite must-see for enthusiasts of the thriller/horror genre."

Hang on, I've Only Just Begun."
"jboyaquar","5","1","2","13 August 2007"," Not nearly as enveloped as others
","Why do producers have a predilection for adapting Stephen King's impressionistic short stories? Although they're blessed with a catchy premise their resolutions are almost always sloppy and overstuffed assuring filmmakers a difficult time ascribing both the visual and temporal into a convincing emotional whole. Unfortunately, this film follows that same pattern. Two different teams collaborated on this project, and their differing takes on the material rears its head early as scenes feel disjointed and the dialogue a little too irreverently silly. However, the strength of the premise and appealing takes by Cusack and Jackson - their scene has a mephistophiclean appeal - draws us into the far-fetched notion of a single room in a large metropolitan hotel as being the beacon of a ridiculous amount of freakish happenings. Credit also to director Hafstrom for using employing every possible camera angle inside '1408' as to open up the audience's mind as to where the source of menace may be coming from...or coming at you next. Cusack is quite capable of carrying most ships as long as he's not required to burden the emotional load. But, this is a King tale - their can't be horror without some treacly subplot involving a kid. And plop - as the action in the room grows more hectic, Cusack's forced to wring through every emotion imaginable... and everything falls apart. I didn't buy anything from the hour point on...and the last moments inside the room are ludicrous. Cusack wisely knows he lacks the talent or charisma to appear in either tentpole or prestige pictures every year - so he generously offers himself to genre - wistful romantic comedy being his favorite. Although this is a sidestep from 'Identity's' surprising bounty, he should continue exploring the dark side - though something closer to 'Grosse Pointe's' black comedy would probably suit his appeal a lot more."
"bburns","7","1","2","11 August 2007"," Cusack finally does a good job outside his comfort zone
","Ever since ""Better Off Dead"", John Cusack has specialized in comedies from independent-minded writers and directors where he plays neurotic intellectuals. And nearly every time he has worked outside that zone, he's fallen flat on his face (e.g. ""Con Air"", ""Runaway Jury""). In ""1408"", for the first time in his career, Cusack has made a good movie that can't be labeled indie or comedy, although he still plays a neurotic intellectual.<br/><br/>Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer of haunted hotel tour guides. Prior to his current career, he wrote a critically acclaimed novel that sold poorly and is now out-of-print. He learns of room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel in New York and is intrigued. When he tries to check into the room, the Dolphin's manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson in another in a series of silly wigs) warns him that nobody has spent more than an hour in the room and lived. They have a heated argument that reveals the crux of the rest of the film: Enslin admits that he does not believe in ghosts or haunted rooms, and Olin accuses him of not believing in anything outside of or bigger than his own ego. This is important because once Enslin gets inside the room, in addition to the standard horror-movie tropes of slashers and ghosts, he is forced to relive his painful past: At one time, he was a happy family man with wife Lily (Mary McCormack) and daughter Katie (Jasmine Jessica Anthony) and they would read the Bible together. But when Katie died, Enslin renounced God and left his wife. And we also learn that Olin is in control of room 1408's supernatural evil.<br/><br/>Normally I don't like the washed-out look of DV, but in this case it worked in helping to create a dream-like environment inside the room. Also--unlike all too many horror films--nobody involved is slumming. The script by Matt Greenberg and Scott Alexander (from a short story by Stephen King) is well-written in the vein of an episode of the original ""Twilight Zone"". The acting is also uniformly good. Special mention must be given to Cusack, as he attempted another haunted hotel movie with ""Identity"" and failed. In that film, he just wasn't credible as a heroic ex-cop. But in ""1408"", I completely believed him as a cynical writer with a troubled past.<br/><br/>I didn't care too much for the fact that director Mikael Hafstrom stole all his visual cues from the greatest Stephen King adaptation and haunted hotel movie of all (Stanley Kubrick's version of ""The Shining"", which King himself hates). And Samuel Jackson should have been banned from wearing hairpieces after ""The Negotiator"". But the main reason I only give this film 7 out of 10 instead of 8 or 9 is the fake ending, where the audience is tricked into thinking this was all a dream. That may be fine for ""The Wizard of Oz"", but it has no business in a film aimed at grown-ups (David Lynch, this means you. I'm still mad at you for ""Mulholland Drive""). Fortunately it's a bit like the Monty Python sketch where a man stands in front of a Soviet firing squad and suddenly wakes up in his mother's arms. ""Thank God it was all a dream,"" he says. To which his mother replies, ""No, dear. This is the dream, you're really about to be executed.""<br/><br/>Overall, ""1408"" is a good thinking person's horror film, like ""The Exorcist"" or ""The Sixth Sense"". Although it doesn't quite measure up to those two, it is a far sight better than the usual teenage slasher fare out there. 7 out of 10."
"jmbartle","8","1","2","6 August 2007"," One of the Best Entries Into the Horror Genre in Recent Years
","Finally a horror movie that messes with your head instead of your stomach. 1408 doesn't try to scare you by throwing gallons of blood onto the screen. It gets its scares by taking a trip into the depths of the human mind. Psychological horror has always been scarier to me, and this film definitely delivers on that.<br/><br/>Great acting all around. You literally feel like your losing your mind along with John Cusack's character. He conquers a hard task by spending most of the time on screen by himself, and he also interacts very well with his surroundings. Samuel L. Jackson was also good in his small role.<br/><br/>The director Mikael Hafstrom really took a step forward from his mediocre American film debut, Derailed. I'm sure its hard to make a full length film about one man in a single room, but he does so successfully. He manages to capture the essence of a Stephen King story like very few directors have been able to do. The only other director that comes to mind off of the top of my head is Frank Darabont, and thats pretty good company to be with."

","For starters i didn't know this was a book before a movie, in which case i think i should have read it first. For anyone who has watched the trailer to 1408, thats it you don't need to watch the film as the trailer contains all there is to see really, unless you absolutely love Samuel Jackson. As usual, Samuels performance is flawless, sarcastic and added the only creepy aspect to this movie for me( apart from the end scene in the film. John Cusack was a total disaster and wasn't believable at all, he overreacted to the slightest thing from the start which i found funny. Other people have mentioned ''the shining'',well they should have asked for advice from everyone who was involved with that film on how to play with the audiences mind as I'm still bothered by that film. Cusack should stick to characters like the one he played in the awesome film'' con air'', and i think Samuel should have played the lead part of 1408 or been able to pick the lead character....better yet next time you want something to psychologically get to you, watch something by Quentin Tarantino or watch films with Jack Nicholson. this film was disappointing. Not the same quality as ''The Green Mile, IT, Carrie, MIsery etc."

","This film was amazing to watch, it had me tense from the word go. The acting was sublime and so too was the writing and direction. There are so many horror films these days that fail to appeal because of the heavy-load of blood and gore, but this was scary and tension filled without having to shed much. For someone who has read Stephen King's novels for a long time and who has been disappointed in the past, when his work has been blemished on screen, I would say that this is by far the best one on screen. Its everything you would want to watch. And its scary too! There were many occasions during this film that I was reaching for something to shield my eyes. This is definitely worth a watch, and especially for chiller and Stephen King fans alike."
"elutz55","9","1","2","2 August 2007"," 1408 Exceeds High Expectations
","Admittedly, I had very high expectations for this film - something that I rarely have for horror films - because of a few reasons. For one, a cast that includes John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson (even if for a few brief scenes) certainly yields grand results. For another, I've always found that thrillers which take place in urban landscapes are always much scarier. In the horror films that take place in the country, there is always a sense of isolation. But if a film taking place in a city can create that same isolation, even around millions of people, that really adds a lot of eeriness to a film.<br/><br/>Still, I had my reservations - even with the superb lineup and the lugubrious cityscape, there is always the chance for a flop. And the effects of a flop would be monstrous - two of my favorite actors and a setting I find to be truly frightening would be wounded. Jackson would have to star in ""Snakes on a Rowboat"", Cusack would have to make another flick where he's a chain-smoking, obsessive-compulsive record store owner, and someone would need to make another Ring movie just to reconcile all the damage that could have been done.<br/><br/>I digress.<br/><br/>Luckily, the film didn't disappoint - Cusack wonderfully did what he does best: freak out, and Jackson was foreboding and successfully laid down the storyboard for the events that would unfold. And yes, the beloved, lonely city landscape prevailed; going even beyond simply being a background, 1408 employed this setting as even another character, becoming a world that Cusack desperately wanted to make contact with - a goal that he could set himself on accomplishing.<br/><br/>Adding to the plot were some psychological scares - such as the overwhelming presence of death within the room - including murders and suicides that hang around in the back of the viewer's mind, as well as appear on the screen to torment Cusack; will their fates be the same? For the majority of the film, the audience is inclined to believe that they will not, that somehow, Cusack will avoid death and escape the ""Kafka-esque"" room with a story to tell and a lesson learned. But as his hour within the hotel room progresses, so does our sinking feeling that he will not escape alive (or dead) and that he shall be doomed to haunt the place, to stalk the bedroom and the bathroom and the living room a spirit, a mere apparition, a poltergeist imprisoned by his own poor decision.<br/><br/>""1408"" exceeded my expectations by making full use of everything they could use. The acting was excellent, the writing and direction were superb, and the music and setting act not only as a backdrop, but as tools to build the morose mood of the room."

In this chilling short story by Stephen King directed by Swedish filmmaker Mikael Håfström, you WILL scream in spite of yourself. <br/><br/>I saw this alone in my room one night and I endured the good creepy build-up leading to skeptical Enslin's fateful entry into Room 1408 of the haunted Dolphin Hotel. I liked the motivated use of extreme close-ups to add to the claustrophobia, and the bird's eye view shots that give a feeling of someone watching over everything. The scary, unsettling cinematography and the masterful, fragmented visuals really make you feel the fear. <br/><br/>Cusack makes 1408 work. His almost one-man act makes a good case of cynicism at the beginning. When he says: ""sarcophagal chambers; hotel rooms are naturally creepy places"" you just keep waiting to be defied. I will never hear The Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun"" the same way again nor look at radio clocks as innocent harbingers of time. You keep expecting the worst. You share his panic and frustration. For your own self-preservation, you want to believe him when he tries to talk sense to his tape recorder to calm himself. The 'power of suggestion' is indeed very strong; the score and sound effects are effective and thoughtful, with enough moments and good pacing for you to sober up till the next. <br/><br/>The momentum is destroyed, however, when the specters are actually shown. Major plot hole: why suddenly think of his laptop and cell phone too late? The monster-like thing bent on hacking him also had a pathetic mask; and then it just starts getting silly (check out what gets faxed to him), then melodramatic in the exposition of his own 'personal ghosts' that he is helplessly exorcising. He is forced to just 'ride it out' like the aftermath of a hallucination gone awry.<br/><br/>Then it starts to get even more fantastic and ridiculous, getting harder to accept as even stranger things happen in the ""Kafkaesque hotel"". Cusack is just such an excellent actor that you still are emotionally tied to him despite the circumstances and share his despair of getting yanked back and forth into alternate realities. Reliving the horror of loss with him was cruel, rude and shocking, but the cheesy dialogue punctuated with the wry humor only he can truthfully deliver helped."
"mikenason","8","1","2","12 July 2007"," It was good.
","This movie has my approval for a PG-13 Thriller/Horror. Very creep indeed. A man stays into a room with many deaths starting from 1912. When things start getting fishy, he tries to escape but realizes that he is trapped in there. He goes through numerous obstacles the room plays on him, which seems to be all his imagination. It kind of takes him into an alternate reality. We then find out that no one enters this room and leaves alive. The phone operator tells him if he's ready to check out, he would need to hang himself. But if he's going down, he's taking the entire room with him. I definitely will be getting this one on DVD and would make a great thriller film to watch at night with friends."
"xo_BrIa_xo","8","1","2","10 July 2007"," I've never screamed in a scary movie, this movie once again proved to me there's a first time for everything..
","This movie was great, it had a good background, a nicely chosen actor, and the setting was perfect. Before I went to see the movie, I thought it was going to be so stupid, but my brother told me before I went, this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. So, I was looking forward to watching. Through almost the whole movie, I had to cover my ears because of how scared i was..haha..its very jumpy, and that really gets me. Before you watch, make sure you like jumpy movies. It's also one of the movies where if your in the movies watching it, make sure you go to the bathroom before it starts because you can't miss anything or your kind of lost. Anyway, this was a great movie and I was very satisfied. I hope another comes out."
"Travthescumbag","Null","1","2","9 July 2007"," Bad movie!
","At the beginning of the movie, employees of the Dolphin Hotel claim that nobody stays in room 1408 very long. Strange, for I didn't want to watch 1408 for very long either.<br/><br/>Judging by the movie trailer and the 7.7 out of 10 rating IMDb users had given the film, I was expecting something good. However, this movie was anything but good. I tried to like it, and I tried to hold on to scenes I did like so that scenes that didn't fit could be forgiven, but it just wasn't possible. There was too much to try to forget.<br/><br/>Now, I can pretend.and I like a good fantasy story, but only when it is supposed to be a fantasy story. When something as portrayed as true at times, and a huge stretch of the imagination at other times, it just doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a lot of promise. Still some minor elements that you'll wish would just go away, but nothing too damaging to the major themea writer who doesn't believe in ghosts is confronted with something he can't explain. That's spooky enough! That's believable! That simple, basic story is something everyone can identify with and believe. Why they wouldn't leave it at that, I don't know. Instead, they complicate things, and thrown in moments meant to be frightening, but cause more confusion than fear.<br/><br/>It appeared that they had something going, as they built the audience up for something huge, something realistic, and something creative, but instead deliver scenes that simply didn't fit the plot the movie laid out.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin, played by John Cusak, is a paranormal invesigator who doesn't believe in ghosts. He feels hotel managers claim places are haunted to boast interest in the hotel. Believable. He thinks that everything believe to be a ""haunting,"" can be contributed to other real factors. Still believable. Once he enters room 1408 in the Dolphin Hotel, everything he has believed before changes. The radio turns on and off. A repair man will not enter the room out of fear, windows open and shut, ghostly images seen around the room, hanging pictures move on their own, and the bed makes itself. All of these things are somewhat believableat least, when referring to a haunting. They're realisticthese things COULD happen, and a number of people claim they happen at various sites, so OK, the movie is still OK.<br/><br/>But then everything changes. Poor Mr. Enslin, who still morns the death of his daughter and sees his father in a strange scene that did not make sense and didn't progress the film in any way, starts to experience more paranormal activity. I'm not even sure the order of it, but it doesn't really mattertrust me: The paintings on the wall come alive, like something out of Harry Potter, he contacts his wife via Yahoo Messenger and a ghost or spirit takes over his image and tells his wife things that he isn't saying (ghosts from 50 years ago can do that), he is chased by a zombie old man in the ventilation shaft, the wall cracks (and I mean CRACKS) and then bleeds, other windows of the hotel vanish, his window is covered with bricks, and his room temperature gets so cold that it begins to snow.<br/><br/>So take out everything they start you with at the beginning, and try to forget about it. Because nothing else you see will be like it. Not one thing will be realistic or even the least bit believable. And nothing else will really make sense.<br/><br/>Even after all of that crap (and there's more) I tried to hold on and I hoped that the ending would somehow pull it all together. But it didn't.<br/><br/>Think of it this waythink of someone you trust, someone who's words have a great deal of credibility. If they come to you and say that they saw a ghost, or a door opened and shut on its own, or the radio turned on by itself...would you believe them? You might.<br/><br/>But what if they came to you saying that a ghost caused it to snow in their room or their wall cracked all over and bleedwould you believe them then? The movie begins as something you can get into, something you can suspend disbelief and enjoy for it is somewhat possible, but then it turns into something else. Some of the events they portray could happen in real lifesome people certainly claim they do. And some of the events only happen in fairy tales. This movie started as something believable, but then quickly turned into a very bad, poorly executed fairy tale.<br/><br/>With Transformers, and the new Die Hard already in theaters, and with the new Harry Potter out tomorrow, there's plenty of other good movies to see. So make like the repairman in this oneand don't go in 1408."
"Ipecac314","7","1","2","8 July 2007"," Best King movie in years!
","Honestly, I came into this movie having low expectations due to the fact that it was PG-13, and as well all know, most of those ""scary"" movies have been terrible. From the start I was intrigued immediately. The fact that it kept you on the edge of your seat, was impressive. It's been a while since I've seen a scary movie that was all mental and made you think about it. When I saw Hostel 2, I was on the edge of my seat, but that's because of the intensity of the violence. Let's face it, most movies can't pull off what this one did. This movie was well written, well directed, and had a great cast. I'd say it's worth a watch AT LEAST once, if not more."
"CinemasPlight","6","1","2","7 July 2007"," What Could of Been a Good Horror Film
","I went to see 1408 in hopes of rekindling my spirit of the horror film genre. Having seen numerous amounts of Drama, Action, and Gore I had high hopes that this movie could pull me back to the genre I never really fully appreciated or understand.<br/><br/>It however, sadly failed. The movie was an enjoyable experience I felt the acting was superb by Cusack who plays Mike Enslin a cynical writer who's sick of his job. Also Samuel L. Jackson who made the room seem scarier with six words: ""It's just an evil f---ing room"" The cinematography and direction were superb, I loved the angles chosen and how we seemed to get closer and closer to Mike's face as the movie went on, but with all these positive things that allowed me to give this movie a six, the only major flaw was the story.<br/><br/>The story did not give me the scary jumps that ""The Shining"" has once given me. I've read Stephen King and his style of horror is merely to blur the line between reality and fantasy the only problem with this is that all of the scary parts came were predictable. I felt it was smart but not scary, a great dramatic story, but not a scary bone-chilling story. What this movie proves is, even with great directing, great acting, and great camera work, the story is what makes a movie great, or decent.<br/><br/>I recommend film lovers to go see it, to prove why the screenplay is just as important if not more important than the camera itself."
"goober448","4","1","2","6 July 2007"," Just didn't work for me....
","A Stephen King short about an evil room made into a film starring John Cusack just has spine chilling thriller written all over it. Just viewing the trailer I felt the chill bumps start rising. I had to go and spoil those wonderful chill bumps. I saw the movie- chill bumps only once & jumped in my seat only twice. During the entire 1 hour and 34 minutes of this film, only one person in the theater made a sound similar to a scream. What went wrong with this film? The story is evident and John Cusack brings it all to the table. Mikael Håfstrom didn't deliver the goods. This is only the second film I've viewed which Mikael Håfstrom has directed. The first was Derailed. Could someone please ask the film companies to cut this man from their list? His direction destroys what should be really good films. The plot in this film is one that should be so intense you grip the edge of your seat the entire film. The direction instead turns out a want to be psychological thriller. I have to give 4 stars for the story and Cusack. Cusack gave 110% trying to make this film work. It saddens me that it didn't. King and Cusack fans will want to see this film. If you're looking for what the trailer promised, don't bother......"

Until now he his a non-believer and has manage to blow out every single superstition in every single place he has been. But now something different is ahead. A room in the Dolphin Hotel seems to have something more than just a scary story. The room 1408 is the room to whip out all the Enslin fears. Based upon a Stephen King's tale this is one more with is seal. Terror, suspense and something special for the end.

"todietotruth","9","1","2","3 July 2007"," Manages to attain what other horror films sorely lack
","I am not a horror fan. One of the best horror films of all time, The Birds, is not on my favourite movie list. Even though it's done by my favourite director, Hitchcock, and obtains that thing that 1408 also obtains... It's not up there because I really just don't like horror... Especially Stephen King.<br/><br/>I found The Shining to be boring... And Red Rose to be trite.<br/><br/>But when I saw this film's trailer, I wanted to watch it for two reasons... The first being that I think Cusak actually has great potential (Identity showed it, though it wasn't a very good flick at all) and I wanted to see if he could live up to it... The second being that I thought this movie might have more to it than the usual spook movie.<br/><br/>I was right.<br/><br/>1408 is an experience. An experience of one man's inability to escape his past. True, this is a subject that could have been attacked in a thousand different ways that we easily could have thought up ourselves, but I doubt would have had the effect this film had.<br/><br/>At one point I was moved to tears by the power of the imagery (when some fools actually began to laugh)... I too, know this man's struggle... And if you stop to think, you realize you know it too.<br/><br/>The room, is his past. He is stuck in it... He has been for some time, way before he ever gets to the hotel. His writing career is stuck because of it... His is stuck estranged from his wife because of it... The room is merely the climax... The moments where he must face those choking memories.<br/><br/>And even though the premise is hokey, the room is effective for this. I think it's a shame that many people will approach this film the wrong way. They'll say it wasn't spooky enough... Or too slow...<br/><br/>*Shakes head* That's what happens when you're not willing to approach a movie for what it is... But insist on approaching it with your expectations... Which happens WAY too often.<br/><br/>This is the one horror film that actually had an existential message that I've seen since The Birds.<br/><br/>It also features Samuel L. Jackson's new best line ever... And an ending finally feature Cusak as a true badass.<br/><br/>Go see it, approach it with an open mind for what it is, then apply liberally."
"barberoux","7","1","2","2 July 2007"," Effective
","""1408"" was an effective scary movie. I typically do not go for this type of movie. I don't believe in ghosts or supernatural phenomena and so just the depiction of either leaves me unimpressed. How well the movie tells the story and pulls you into its world is very important. Too often the premise and execution is just silly and not in the least scary. Frank Booth in ""Blue Velvet"" was scary. Anyway I enjoyed the movie. It was paced well and slowly revealed the scary bits. I think it was effective because it could be seen as just a mental breakdown of the protagonist, that what was happening was just happening inside his head. I'm going to issue a SPOILER warning here so I don't wreck the watching experience for others but I really want to comment on the false ending. I thought the false ending was effective since it was the way most of these types of movies end and I was ready to leave when things started to go weird again. I was surprised and amused at how effective it was. SPOILER warning defunct. John Cusack was effective in the role of the disbelieving author. He plays the world weary part well. Samuel L. Jackson was good as always. The movie is not a gore fest but is more of a physiological thriller and I recommend it. I give it 7 out of 10 stars."
"jaredmobarak","5","1","2","30 June 2007"," Let's ""Encyclopedia Brown"" this1408
","It seems that the best Stephen King films are culled from his short stories (Shawshank Redemption and Stand By Me among them). However, those also tend to be the dramatic films with little supernatural scares. So, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the new film 1408. It is a short story, so it would hopefully be concise and to the point, but it was also a thriller/horror which never quite make the jump from book to screen successfully. What works in words at creating imagery in your head doesn't pack the same punch when someone else shows you what it looks like to them. The film has been garnering good buzz though, and I'm a John Cusack apologist; the man can still be loved even in the drivel he associates with lately. So, the question becomes, was the film a successful thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout? My answer here is actually yes, but with numerous reservations. There was a lot to like with this movie, but unfortunately there was just as much to shake your head at.<br/><br/>The real winner in all of this is Cusack. He gives a fantastic performance while being the center of attention throughout the entire duration. He must get through many emotions as we slowly find out the motives that led him to being a cynical occult writer, estranged from his wife. His story is a tragic one and Cusack delivers on the repressed anger and sadness he has tried to keep buried inside. Once he enters room 1408, however, all those feelings are used against him and brought to the surface, creating the most horrific hour of his life. Horrific in the psychological sense; he deals with his own demons in the film, not ghoulies and monsters. The way in which director Mikael Håfström deals with these manifestations of Cusack's soul is very effective.<br/><br/>As far as the progression of what was happening to him in that hotel room, I couldn't have been more pleased. The set pieces were creative and the climate changes that transformed the room with every increase in the scale of terror were effective. Sure the jump scares were tried and true, (a crazed person with a knife that popped up every once in a while, the high tension of walking a building's ledgeCat's Eye anyone?and the dead man trapped in the ventilation system), but they were also paced right and less boring than just common. All the effects were good, the TV-like holograms of the dead walking around the room was handled well if also the norm in all horror films these days, and the room's destruction seemed real rather than computer-generated. I wouldn't be surprised if they actually destroyed the set rather than dressed it up to look that way.<br/><br/>Where the film really fails is in the supporting characters and the misstep that occurs towards the end. For a movie that works when it is just Cusack in a hotel room, we are given too many outsiders and too many scenes outside of the room. Not to ruin anything, but there is a moment when our lead exits the hotel towards the conclusion of the film. This ends up derailing any suspense that had been building for me. Not only does it kill the claustrophobia that was settling in, but it kills the pacing and makes you think they are going in a specific direction which I just keep saying to myself, ""I really hope they don't do what I think,"" instead of watching to see how it plays out. The use of twists these days is so common that when utilized correctly or not, the audience finds themselves thinking about the structure of the trick rather than letting it happen to them.<br/><br/>As far as the supporting roles, I'm not saying they were poorly acted, they were poorly written and fleshed out. Besides Mary McCormack as Cusack's estranged wife, all the roles were made to seem more important than they are. The real failure, to me, is the Gerald Olin role, played by Sam Jackson. What begins as a setup character, someone to give us the hotel's history and create mood becomes something else completely by the end. If Jackson never came back on screen after Cusack goes into the room, I would have been happy. He soon becomes our lead's default person to blame for the crazy events happening, and that is OK. What isn't is that as the film goes on, we start to see Jackson some more, almost like he is really orchestrating it all. The truth is though, that it makes no sense because all that is happening is inside Cusack's head. It is the final scene with Jackson that put me over the top on hating his role. The moment takes place outside of the room and therefore is real, but it is so cryptic and unnecessary that it just makes you subvert all you were thinking for absolutely no payoff whatsoever.<br/><br/>So, overall, the mood and atmosphere were effective, Cusack was amazing throughout, and the way the psychological horrors play out, right to the end scene with his tape recorder, is spot-on. Unfortunately, the actual scares were generic and the writing of the supporting roles weak. While it is definitely not a total loss, I wouldn't recommend seeing it in the theatres. A rental or TV-sitting is all that's needed here."

","Mike Enslin is a moderately successful writer about the paranormal and a dedicated skeptic. He visits supposedly haunted places and writes about them and it is ""just a job."" However, when he checks into The Dolphin hotel's room 1408, against the wishes and warnings of the manager, he finds out his is in for a lot more than another boring night as the line between reality and nightmare begins to get thinner...<br/><br/>By the time the film is over someone might think that said line didn't just get very thin... it vanished! And the build up to this collision of real and nightmarish is very interesting. The film starts a bit slow and by the time Enslin gets into the room you are just eager to see what sorts of scares the film has to offer. However, thinking about the sort of drawn out introduction there are plenty of signs, some obvious some not, that are hints and virtually all are referenced later. Even when Enslin first enters the room the build up isn't really slow... it's gradual. Just like that thinning border between reality and nightmare. There is no jump to the other side but more of a slow or even painfully slow drift through some kind of limbo.<br/><br/>The presentation of the supernatural was also pretty interesting. Bearing some similarities to The Shining (also originally written by Stephen King) the supernatural occurrences here aren't just seemingly random frightening occurrences. They start that way, but as Enslin begins to explore his new reality there is a reason for him being faced with the horror in 1408. A reason that hits home for him and that makes the story come full circle and makes a smart use of ""ghosts"" to explain certain things. And mercifully sparing excessive sappiness or violence. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violent content/terror. Ages 13+."
"Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday","7","1","2","28 June 2007"," John Cusack's One Man Show in a House of Horrors
","In a world where film goers actually cough up $9.50 to see blood and guts for movies like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw 4,"" the horror genre seems dead in the water by now. ""Psycho"" and ""Jaws"" seem like an urban legend, where imagination and true terror of the unknown reigned. People would rather watch basically a gruesome 90-minute episode of ""Fear Factor"" than to have a cold hand slowly massage your neck while breaking it at the same time, never really revealing the enemy and therefore making the (almost) loneliness unbearable. While ""1408"" will probably not become a classic like the Hitchcock or the Spielberg films and clearly invites comparison to the classic ""The Shining,"" it does what very few horror films have done in years: given chills with the fewest of gore and blood. And then it goes where no horror film has gone before: it genuinely breaks your heart.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a paperback author who debunks ""haunted"" houses. When he receives a postcard warning him not to go in the eponymous room number, that only intrigues him even more. At the Dolphin Hotel, his interest is only raised when Mr. Olin (Samuel L. Jackson in a small role but, as always, stealing every scene he graces) tries ANYTHING to get him from going into that room, including bribes and revealing information about the room even the newspapers have never reported. But Enslin is even more stubborn than Olin, and gets the key to the room. Though initially cynical (aren't all writers?) and pessimistic about finding anything haunting about that room, he is soon proved wrong. A clock radio blasts a Carpenters song without any button pushed. Then it starts counting down from 1 hour. Just when Mike's realized he wants out of the room, he's trapped in his own hell in a room that would make the saloon of Satre's ""No Exit"" look like a cocktail party in Holly Golightly's apartment.<br/><br/>To talk about the twists and spoilers would only ruin the effectiveness on-screen...and believe me, there are plenty, even if a handful are given away in the trailer for the film.<br/><br/>The amazing glory of ""1408"" is that the amount of thrills are more than made up for in emotion. Though the trailer and poster advertise the Gothic tone and hellish roller coaster ride of the movie, the film will surprise you with the tears as often as the screams. We see through flashbacks/torture devices that at one point, Enslin wasn't always alone in a room. He once had a family, a wife and a daughter. He had promise as a novelist, as we see at a book signing. But then his young beloved daughter died and shattered his existence. Separated from his wife, Enslin is an emotionally closed-off human being. Instead of slowing down the pace of the story, it enhances it, in the way that ""Batman Begins"" nearly LOST its momentum when Bruce Wayne put on his costume and became Batman. The character development is nearly as interesting as the action.<br/><br/>Everything I wrote above would mean nothing and produce no love or emotion had it not been in the hands of such an amazing actor as John Cusack, who has to carry the movie almost entirely on his back. Much as I adore Cusack (""Say Anything..."" was my all-time favorite movie as a teenager), I haven't been impressed with his recent movies--I know he has to pay the water bills, but did we have to sit through a boring and clichéd 1/2 hour sitcom achingly stretched out to 90 minutes and then call it ""Must Love Dogs""? But here he delivers far and away his best performance since ""High Fidelity."" Cusack literally screams and cries, but never once does it feel hammy or contrived. The nuances, subtleties and reactions of Enslin feel improvised and fresh. Cusack demands our attention, and boy does he earn it. He shows a versatility and a rainbow of emotions that he has never shown before, and finally is given a character with so many dimensions. There is a scene that I'm sure will be talked about, when he sees his daughter and has to re-experience her demise. Every angle of his face is full of pain, his body weak with longing and uncertainty. It's amazing to note that Cusack in real life is not a father. How could he have known?...<br/><br/>Mikael Hafstrom made some amazing movies in Europe before, inevitably, making English films. His American debut ""Derailed"" would be forgettable had Jennifer Aniston not floundered in her first dramatic role. But he's a director to watch--his tone and atmosphere is dark, and somewhere Edgar Allen Poe must be smiling. He keeps his story moving at a nice pace. There is never a dull or predictable moment in ""1408."" <br/><br/>You may walk into the theater and be expected to scream. You'll walk out scratching your head in confusion, with a screaming pulse, and just maybe a broken heart. That's something only an amazing movie can accomplish."
"zardoz-13","8","1","2","27 June 2007"," ""1408"" is one eerie creep show that delivers the shivers without sickening you with its skulduggery
","Watching the creepy John Cusack horror chiller ""1408"" reminded me of the spooky Jack Nicholson screamer ""The Shining,"" except everything that occurred on a grand scale in an entire hotel in the Nicholson picture is confined to one single room occupancy in the Cusack epic. Not surprisingly, talented Swedish director Mikael Hafstrom of ""Derailed"" and scenarists Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander, and Larry Karaszewski took their haunted room opus ""1408"" from a short story by ""Shining"" author Stephen King. ""1408"" concerns a notorious room at the Hotel Dauphin in New York City that nobody spends more than an hour in before they either commit suicide or die from natural causes. Compared with previous haunted house movies, this gripping, white-knuckled adaptation of a Stephen King yarn doesn't break any new ground. Nevertheless, Hafstrom illustrates that with good writing and agile directing 'less' can actually mean 'more.' Actor John Cusack, who has never starred in a throat-throttling tale of terror, is virtually the whole show and his persuasive performance rivals the first-rate computer generated special effects. Hardcore gorehounds may grimace at this PG-13 nail biter because you won't see private body parts hacked up and fed to German Shepherds as in ""Hostel: Part II."" Basically, ""1408"" qualifies as a stimulating, old-fashioned horror movie whose psychological plot invites favorable comparison with Rod Serling's venerable TV show ""The Twilight Zone""<br/><br/>Mike Enslin (John Cusack of ""Identity"") has acquired a 'ghost buster' reputation for the books he has written where he exposes haunted houses with supernatural apparitions as hoaxes. Mike doesn't believe in ghosts, but he is as game as he is curious. One day a postcard arrives about the Hotel Dauphin and its room 1408. He tries to register at the Dauphin to spend a night in the room, but the innkeepers refuse to accommodate our hero. Enslin's publisher Sam Farrell (Tony Shalhoub of TV's ""Monk"") threatens the hotel with a civil rights lawsuit. Halfheartedly, hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Snakes on a Plane"") allows Mike to check in, but not before he enlightens the author about 1408's tragic history. Earlier, Mike had discovered in his research that 4 people killed themselves in 1408, but Olin surprises him with more revelations. Fifty-six other guests died from natural causes after they stayed in 1408. One of Olin's maids gouged out her eyes out when he left her unattended in the room for a few minutes. Predictably, Mike dismisses Olin's admonitions as hokum. He points out that he has been at some of the worst nightmare palaces in the U.S. and proved that none were haunted. Mike's skepticism doesn't get him very far after he shuts the door to 1408 and settles in for the evening. Less than twenty minutes later strange things transpire. The AM-FM clock radio begins an hour-long countdown and the classic top-40 Carpenter's tune ""We've Only Just Begun"" splits his eardrums. No matter how many times that Mike shuts off or unplugs the AM-FM clock radio, the possessed appliance recovers. Mike finally goes over the edge when a window inexplicably slams down on his hand and draws blood. Mike decides it's time to bail, but he's too late. When he tries to unlock the door from the inside with the key, the keyhole devours the key and the knob snaps off in Mike's fist when he yanks on it.<br/><br/>""Derailed"" director Mike Hafstrom relies on imagination rather than blood and gore to frighten the fiddlesticks out of you in ''1408."" Of course, he resorts to the time-honored horror movie tactics of having something leap out at you without warning, but he doesn't plow this tactic into the ground. Moreover, he refrains from harrowing depictions of ax-wielding felons on chopping sprees. There are several moments in ""1408"" when it appears as if nothing is occurring in the quaint hotel room. For example, Mike uses his laptop to instant message his ex-wife Lily (Mary McCormack of ""Mystery, Alaska,"" who lives in Manhattan, to tell her about his predicament. However, after the N.Y.P.D. investigates, they inform Lily that they found nobody in room 1408. At another point, Mike tries desperately to escape from the room by climbing out onto the ledge, but what he sees outside scares him so badly that he returns to the room. Not long afterward, Mike has hallucinations that his young daughter Katie (newcomer Jasmine Jessica Anthony) who died from cancer has come back to console him. Is Mike going insane? Does evil really dwell in the hotel? ""1408"" emerges as one of the better horror movies about demonic hotels. Hafstrom's suspenseful 94-minute saga surpasses the half-baked Ashley Judd psycho drama ""Bug,"" splashes less blood and gore than Eli Roth's ""Hostel: Part II,"" and puts its hero through more mind-blowing ordeals than Kate Beckinsale and Luke Wilson faced in their own off-beat serial killers-in-a-hotel-room thriller ""Vacancy."" Altogether, ""1408"" is one eerie creep show that delivers the shivers without sickening you with its skulduggery."

","For anyone out there who is debating whether or not to go see this film, hesitate no more. This is absolutely the scariest movie EVER MADE. I am a huge fan of the Saw movies, yet when 1408 ended, I said that it made Saw look like a nursery rhyme. This movie is complete with amazing acting, spectacular visuals, extremely terrifying jumps and images which will leave you chilled to the bone. This film captures the audience and never lets go. This is also the best Stephen King movie and blows away the horror of the Shining. Definitely worth the money and by far the best horror movie I have ever seen. Go see 1408 and be prepared to be scared to the core!"
"reclined","9","1","2","25 June 2007"," Best film so far this year
","Wow! What a great tribute to earlier films like ""The Shining"" (with the snow, a writer really ""losing it, "" etc.), ""The Amityville Horror"" (bleeding walls, anyone?),""Groundhog Day"" (with the existential radio music), ""Poltergeist"" (with a nearly inescapable interior), and even the old TV episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" that force us to consider whether what we are seeing is reality or fantastic hallucination.<br/><br/>At the same time, it's also a tribute to Edgar Allan Poe-- a collapsible structure to rival the ""House of Usher's,"" a protagonist as mad as the ""Tell Tale Heart's,"" a painting of a ship that turns into a true ""Descent Into the Maelstrom,"" a walled-in victim reminiscent of ""The Cask of Amontillado"" and a mental chase of sorts that's right on par with ""The Man of the Crowd.""<br/><br/>And yet, we never really feel as if Stephen King has really stolen too much here. Sure, the ax-wielding specter looks a little bit like the killer clown from ""It,"" but there's enough here that seems fresh and innovative: a laptop that sends the room's requests instead of the tenant's, a throttling of a hospitality fridge instead of a hotel manager, and a real satiric sting on automated-voice systems.<br/><br/>Cusack is perfect in every scene except for a few. There's a revolving shot near the end where he makes a ridiculous ""crazy"" face before it bleeds into a more convincing ""hear no evil"" kind of pose, and his early vehemence after the window cuts his hand seems a little too abrupt for such a calm, cynical guy.<br/><br/>Great ideas here, though, to really begin the breakdown: the call to the window across the street only to have us shudder at its own reflections is classic, and the replaying of ""We've Only Just Begun"" as the room's sinister overture is brilliant as well.<br/><br/>The conversation between Cusack and Jackson in the manager's office is almost worth the price of admission alone and will leave us with a new catch phrase: ""It's just an evil f---'n room.""<br/><br/>Let's hope that the Academy remembers this one come next year-- I'd love to see a return to movies as truly eerie as this."

","I've never read a Stephen King novel (I don't read many novels anyway!)but I've enjoyed many of the movies based on them. I can't say whether or not the book was better but I can say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. There were many Stephen King based movies that have disappointed me so I'm glad to say this isn't one of them. It may have been a bit slow at times and I wouldn't call it terrifying but if you like Stephen King stories, you should see this movie. There are a couple of nice twists too! John Cusack is one of may favorite actors of his generation, he shows a wide range of emotions and does it very well! My vote would actually be 8.5/10 but since I couldn't pick 8.5, I picked 9. I hope that more Stephen King novels are made into movies and done as well as this one. The special effects were very good too! One thing I'd like to say to the people that give this movie 1 or 2 out of 10, you're in the minority. If you love Stephen King's novels, the movies will probably never live up to your expectations so rating the movie so poorly doesn't serve anyone. Take a couple of days to cool off before you vote!"

","I went to see this with some anticipation, I won't lie. Hearing this was a great Stephen King film (something few and far between) and hearing that Cusack's performance was stellar I didn't know what to think going in, only I hoped it would be good. I was not let down. Although not top notch, and with an ending or reasons for hauntings not entirely explained it was an entertaining interpretation of the King novel. I say ""interpretation"" because it did take certain liberties on the story, however it was still a great ride! The first hour of the film are great, the last 30 mins, goes on a gradual decline, upping the CG effects, but it still works, just not as well as the first hour. All in all, good lead in to the summer, I hope to see more from Cusack in the horror sense, he could be an over the top kind of horror hero (am I the only one who thought he played this role like Bruce Campbell would, circa Evil Dead 2?).

"screenwrita17","9","1","2","24 June 2007"," 1408 is a ghost story that actually works
","1408 is not your typical ghost story, and that's why it works! It's not a family moving into the haunted mansion, or teenagers trying to solve the death of a ghost they met. It's something completely new, and that's what makes it a good ghost story. John Cusack plays a writer who writes about haunted places after he visits them. After receiving a post card from the Dolphin Hotel, he decides to check out the haunted room they have to offer. After repeated warnings from the hotel manager(Samuel L. Jackson), Cusack decides to stay in the room. Whit out giving too much away, I liked that in this movie, John Cusack can't escape what he's going through. In other ghost movies, the people can easily run and leave the haunted place, but this movie is different in that way that the character cannot escape what's happening. The movie has plenty of jumps, scares, twists, and turns to keep going until the movie is finished. If you're looking for a fresh type of ghost story, check into 1408, and you shouldn't be disappointed."
"xredgarnetx","7","1","2","24 June 2007"," Scary and inventive, but a bit overwhelming at times
","1408 is the (mostly) scary tale of a once-promising author turned hack writer (John Cusack) who is determined to spend a night in a supposedly haunted hotel room in mid-town Manhattan, of all places. He is amply warned off this plan by the hotel manager (Sam Jackson), to no avail. The room has claimed numerous victims, most of whom have met bloody fates after spending an hour or less in the room. Cusack is no sooner checked in than he wishes he could check out, having almost lost his hand to a window with a mind of its own. And that's only the beginning. The room soon throws everything at him, and it all gets to be a bit much after awhile. The elaborate, eye-popping sets are magnificent and were obviously shot overseas to save money. Since the movie is derived from a short-short story, the scenario is opened up to include a subplot involving the writer's estranged wife and dead daughter. And this is where things go slightly awry. The dead daughter bit is a really tired cliché, and the actress playing the daughter is not particularly convincing. Nevertheless, what the filmmakers have done with Stephen King's marvelous little tale is quite the feat of filmic ledgerdemain. Cusack is great and he definitely sees ghosts, which were absent in the short story and are a welcome addition here. Jackson is also terrific, although physically he is quite a departure from the manager as described in the story. The movie ending is not that far off from the story ending, praise be, and it is actually more clever than the story ending. Aside from the boring dead daughter business, I would strongly advise you not to see 1408 alone. It is pretty scary. Even if it is only a PG-13."

","Walking out of the theater I tried to think of the last horror flicks that I have thought was as good as this. Ghost Ship and 13 Ghost were the last ones to come to my mind. Being a Cusack fans makes this one even better. John Cusack holds the evolutionist's beliefs in ghosts and God and goes around writing books like ""The 10 Most Haunted Motels"". Most hotels ""claiming"" to be haunted send him invitations begging him to revue their hauntedness on his scale of 1 to 10 skulls then see their bookings increase by something like 80%. He receives an anonymous postcard in his own hand writing (creative) not to stay in room 1408 in the Dolphin hotel. He tries to book room 1408 and the hotel wishes him not to stay there and have no interest in anything he does because they keep a 90% booking and never let anyone stay in that room. If a room in a hotel is available, by law, a hotel has to give it up to a paying customer when it is requested. He gets his way and more."

It's worth seeing, but don't look for answers. Also, it does little for the audience to play into this emotional, family driven nightmare. Making the horror personal in the room fell short because the character involved seemed to display little emotion or depth and gives nothing to the audience to work with. I think Cusack did a great job, but I think his job was not that great. It was a new role for him and he did it well. I think most people will enjoy the scares and the unfolding mystery. I just hope they get more out of the ending than I did."

"vortexrider","7","1","2","23 June 2007"," Vivid, scary experiences but too little character
","1408 is an above average Stephen King style film that has pretty good scares and some touching moments. Just like in other films based on Stephen King's books the main character Michael is haunted by his past demons which seem to materialize throughout the film. As can be seen from the trailer there is a sick child involved, so you see what I am talking about.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is done pretty well. The hotel is scary, the ghosts are scary, and there are plenty moments where you will be scared out of your seat. There is not too much gore, which is a good thing as the film manages to be an effective horror movie without it.<br/><br/>What 1408 does lack is well developed characters. The best movies, especially the ones based on Stephen King's stories, have well developed scary characters to represent evil. They may be demons such as in IT or The Stand. They could be aliens as in Dreamcatcher, or werewolves like as in Silver Bullet. Here however, there are manifestations of evil that the protagonist goes through, but there is no personified demon or evil he might have to face. This means there is no well defined conflict between the good and the evil.<br/><br/>1408 is still a great film that does not follow the trends and has no clichés. You will not see body parts and blood splatter on the screen or any sex scenes, but you will still enjoy the film and be scared."
"dfranzen70","9","1","2","23 June 2007"," Your spine will shatter with terror
","Prepare to be shocked! 1408, the story of a truly haunted hotel room, is electric and terrifying and not a little bit unsettling.<br/><br/>John Cusack stars as Mike Enslin, a writer who specializes in debunking haunted-whatever myths. He's stayed in hotels and inns and B&Bs all across the country and has not, he says, ever seen evidence of paranormal behavior. Even so, he's managed to make a somewhat modest living writing about his experiences. He's a cynic, as most writers are, but Enslin is not only skeptical about things, he outright doesn't believe in anything, owing in no small part to an earlier tragedy in his life.<br/><br/>And then one day he finds a postcard in his mail from the Dolphin Hotel in New York. There's but one sentence on the back: ""Don't go into Room 1408."" Enslin's research then shows that numerous people have died in that particular hotel room - people jumping to their deaths, people slashing their own throats, gouging their own eyes, and so on. Pretty creepy stuff. But since that's sort of par for the course in Enslin's line of work, he doesn't think much of it and manages to wrangle a reservation in the infamous room.<br/><br/>The hotel's manager, Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) tries desperately to talk Enslin out of staying in the room overnight. No one lasts more than an hour, he warns. Olin points out that many people have died in 1408 of *natural* causes, too - bringing the death toll to 56. Olin even offers Enslin a rare bottle of booze and the chance to read up on the history of the room, anything to keep Enslin from actually going into the room. He fails.<br/><br/>And who could blame Enslin for being a wee bit skeptical that 1408 is anything to be scared of? He's been in so many places just like the Dolphin, from seedy motels to high-rise palaces, and he's never seen anything all that terrifying, and certainly nothing that couldn't be explained away easily enough. And then he steps into 1408, and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>It appears to be such an ordinary room, a fact that Enslin notes into his dictaphone. But then it gets hot, and the window slams shut on his fingers, and he hears a baby crying, and most importantly, the digital clock radio seems to be counting down from one hour - even after he forcibly yanks it from the wall outlet. Before you know it, ghosts from his own past are appearing in his room alongside the ghosts of those who'd died there themselves.<br/><br/>The greatest part about all of this is that while Enslin's mind is being tortured, smacked around like a tetherball hooked to a pole of sanity, we're suffering right along with him. We jump when he jumps - and not before he jumps. He feel like screaming just as he does. We're right there with him through ever shiver, every shudder, every wide-eyed gulp of terror. Enslin isn't merely frazzled, he's undone. Even he can't explain the happenings inside 1408 as creaky floorboards or bad wiring. The horror in the room is personal, reducing even the cockiest skeptic into a pile of blubbering goo.<br/><br/>Cusack, whom I think is one of the finest actors of his generation, is absolutely aces. His idiom is that he's an Everyman, not someone to whom superhuman powers have been conveyed. Throw another actor into the movie, and you'd expect him to grit his teeth and wipe out the unseen enemies with a blowtorch and some grenades, but not Cusack. Cusack's Enslin doesn't know how to deal with the psychological warfare, because neither would we.<br/><br/>That ripping sound you just heard? It was your sanity departing right after Enslin's.<br/><br/>***1/2"
"somf","8","1","2","23 June 2007"," I have to throw my two cents in here and give some kudos to Hafstrom
","This is one of the best Stephen King adaptations ever and without a doubt the best in well over 20 years, as has been said by many of the other reviewers. John Cusack gives an Oscar worthy performance as well. Though I highly doubt he will be recognized come Oscar time, it truly is a tour de force performance. But no one seems to be giving Hafstrom praises. Along with John Dahl and Gregory Hoblit, Hafstrom ranks in my list of little talked about directors whose films I plan to never miss. You liked this film and you don't mind subtitles, then check out ""Evil"". Don't be fooled that it is another horror film though. It is more a coming of age tale, but truly gripping. The guy is an excellent director. ""Derailed"" was nothing great but it was a very solid and entertaining film as well. I really like this guy. One more thing, catch 1408 in the theater if you can. I think most home systems won't capture the sound quality that made me jump several times while watching this solid scary film yesterday."

","****Not really a spoiler**** <br/><br/>""1408"" begins with us meeting Mike Enslin, played by John Cusack, who is a haunted house book writer/detective. Enslin, being the unbeliever of sorts, receives a letter in the mail from Dolphin Hotel manager Gerald Olin (Sam Jackson) saying not to enter room 1408. Being the cynic, Enslin promptly gathers information about the hotel.<br/><br/>From the opening of the hotel in 1920, people have been killing themselves by way of strangulation, wrist cuttings, even drowning in a bowl of food. Even with all the warnings and bribes from Manager Olin, Enslin dutifully requests the room.<br/><br/>Upon entry, Enslin notices the makings of the most average room imaginable. With this he makes the most laughable comment in the entire movie, ""This is it? You gotta be sh*tting me."" This is where the real fun begins. All the way from seeing his dead daughter to finding out that he isn't occupying the room, 1408 lacks the scare tactics it would take to make the even most terrified movie goer to jump.<br/><br/>Sure, there is a few little tense sequences. But all in all, 1408 is another movie that, although good, lacks the power to make in memorable"

","What was it that disturbed me about 1408? Was it the part when he looked across the street and saw himself in the other building? Or was every time the alarm clock turned itself on and started playing that music? Or maybe it was when he was trying to get into the next room over only to find that instead of another window to crawl into, it was just more of the cold brick wall? Well, I can say that all of these things were good qualities of a jumpy thriller flick. However, what I found made this movie work was the typical things you would find in a hotel room. The elevator music...the paintings...the bible...the bed that countless people have been in (a fact John was happy to bring up). Yes, I am going to be reminded of 1408 every time I check into a hotel for a while.<br/><br/>There have been many horror movies in the past few years. The most notable stories have been the one where a group of people are lured off the interstate where there is no cell phone service, and creepy villains await them with sharp objects. And then there is the one where a man imprisons several people and tortures them, usually with psychological mind games for no reason at all. 1408 is neither. And while I question whether it does earn the genre of horror, it certainly kept the annoying audience in the theater screaming on opening night.<br/><br/>Once again John Cusack is that guy that goes into the hotel and finds himself in a situation with no rational answers. This movie was no Identity, but I still give 1408 its props."

This horror movie is definitely more of a psychological thriller than a pure gore flic so you are never quite sure which direction it is headed. Mr. Cusack and Mr. Jackson both did a terrific job acting which help sell the story. I was entertained and I highly recommend this movie.

"aharmas","4","2","9","22 June 2007"," Was this as bland for you as it was for me?
","There is more than one saving grace in ""1408""; unfortunately, it is the tour-De-force by Mr. Cusack that literally kills everything else here. The concept is fine, the special effects are sometimes very impressive, but the whole project feels like the accompanying documentary that shows up in a few DVD's... it is not the movie, it doesn't have the dramatic core that makes the feature presentation appealing, either good, bad, superb, or awful. What is so distinctive about this film is that it feels very bland, devoid of any life, inspiration, or difference between the highs and lows.<br/><br/>Cusack, the non believer, pretty much, along the lines of the most interesting ""The Reaping"", where an intense Hillary Swank became personally involved in finding redemption and salvation for a town and others, as well as herself. In ""1408"", a reporter is now in the middle of a world that he doesn't really believe in. Clunkily directed and written, Cusack goes from a typical assignment to a nightmarish one, where is quickly besieged by his own demons and a few other unexplainable events, and he learns that the occurrences that he has somehow disregarded as impossible, are indeed more real than he ever thought possible.<br/><br/>There are some ""chilling"" moments in the film, as Cusack realizes that he has lost all control, and a couple of times we see the moments that would have startling in a much better movie, here look like apathetic first rehearsals. There is a moment when Cusack searches for numbing liquor, and instead he opens a window into the manipulative connection between horror and reality. In the climax, there is another upsetting scene, with the power of a bad ""Three Stooges sketch"".<br/><br/>Maybe it's the anticipation of seeing an experiment with Cusack, who is an intelligent and capable actor. One expects much more than this amateurish result. Cusack somehow typecasts himself. He looks rather familiar, perhaps in the way he is presented. There is not much that is different from the Cusack we have seen in films, like ""High Fidelity"", ""Must Love Dogs"", or a few other movies. In fact, his physical appearance might be a drawback here. Had more time been invested in smoothing details and had someone taken the time to look at the director's work before the entire film was shot, we might have come up with a much better movie.<br/><br/>There is something known as suspension of disbelief, but I doubt even that can help here. So, American audiences have already used much of that when viewing ""Spiderman 3"", ""Shrek 3"", and ""Pirates 3"", after those three there is not much left, and ""1408"" is the first casualty of the summer. Hollywood, you have the resources, use them and come up with another Golden Age; well, maybe you can at least get close enough to silver..."

How can a room be evil? It's not alive. Is it some kind of a ghost? Evil spirit? Demon? What? Something has to be behind all of it and the fact that the manager never bothered to try fixing the underlying problem - the room being haunted by some evil presence, instead of simply saying the room is evil, nobody can stay in it... It's stupid. There are way better horrors to spend your time on. This is a big failure for my tastes."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","10","1","3","8 February 2018"," Less is more
","I'll never understand why so many people think that for a horror film to be ""scary"" or ""good"", it needs to have lots of blood, sex, gore and swearing. 1408, much like 2012's ""Sinister"" and 2001's ""Session 9"", relies less on cheap thrills and gimmicks and instead uses atmosphere to tell a story that's more sad than frightening, a perfect portrayal of a man going through the stages of deep grief in a hotel room feeding off his own bad memories and sadistically waving them in front of him. Set in beautiful New York City, it follows the obnoxiously cynical yet strangely likable Mike Enslin, a writer of cheap supernatural fodder who doesn't actually believe a single thing he publishes. He takes great pride in mocking and debunking the beliefs of his readers, even advising a young man to visit Disney World's Haunted Mansion in Orlando if he's looking for ""real ghosts"". Worse than that he mocks those who rely on ghost stories to keep their businesses open, including Mr. Olin, the manager of the Dolphin Hotel who actually wishes the owners of the building would simply shut the room down. He's a decent guy and he feels responsible in a way for the room's many atrocities, but he's simply unable to sway Mike from worming his way in and getting 1408 all to himself for the night.<br/><br/>This is a truly remarkable, criminally underrated film. It's not as massive and epic as ""The Shining"", yet it manages to convey something really unsettling throughout, whether it's a deceased corpse of a sewing machine salesman in an air duct, two parents losing their young daughter to cancer or the notion that not believing in something will only make it stronger. It's not showy or pretentious or cheesy, it's just a good, clean ghost story reminiscent of old classics in every respect. You never know what will happen next but Mike is so flawed that it makes him all the more human and honest as a protagonist in a story that seems to be eating him alive."

Meet Mike Enslin. He was dealt a bad hand. In fact, his little girl died. It's made him pretty cynical, and he now makes a career as a sort of reviewer of the ""scare factor"" of hotels claimed to be haunted. His skepticism drives him to test the infamous room 1408 of The Dolphin in New York. The plot is interesting and the back-story fairly nicely told. As a character study, it doesn't leave much to be desired. This builds up atmosphere impeccably well, and almost all of the countless of effective shocks are from the mood, with a very limited use of blood and gore. I would call this a psychological horror-thriller. The Shining is an appropriate comparison, and the Silent Hill video-games are similar, as well. This makes several decisions that took guts to make, and they tend to pay off. There are a lot of jump-scares, but not a single one is the cheap ""cat leaps at the camera"" type. The acting is all strong, including the child, with Cusack's vital performance being fully convincing, and Jackson doing amazing, as usual. Dialog is great and well-delivered. There is some humor, very natural, never forced and not an excessive amount. The effects are incredible. Cinematography and editing are masterful. I haven't watched Ondskan, or, in English, Evil, Håfström's most talked-about of his Swedish films, though I now wish to more than ever. Both the Theatrical Release and Director's Cut are on the set. The two are largely identical save for twelve minutes of running time(which may add up to rendering the DC an R), the tone of the final scene being the biggest difference. There are well-done and informative featurettes about the production, as well as a commentary track well worth listening to, deleted scenes all in the complete state(meaning they look and sound just as good as what wasn't taken out), two alternate endings(both being other takes on those of the two versions of the movie), a trailer, B-roll footage and several brief interviews that do not contain spoilers. There is language(they went about as far with that as they could and maintain a PG-13 rating), violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of this type of picture. 7/10"

","I love horror movies. I like John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson in most movies I've seen them in. Honestly, I tried to like this movie. Decent actors, a haunted hotel room setup, what's not to like, after all?<br/><br/>In the beginning I thought my hopes would be fulfilled, the setup is just nothing short of great. John Cusack plays a disillusioned horror novelist visiting supposedly haunted places, only to find there's nothing to them after all. After returning from such a place he receives a post card that lures him to room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. Samuel L. Jackson comes into play as the manager of said hotel. The following dialog between Jackson and Cusack is really well written and well acted and sets the bar pretty high for the rest of the movie: Jackson manages to convincingly portray a manager who's really trying to talk a guy out of staying in that room. After that I was pretty hyped for the rest of the movie. Sadly, the setup sets the bar too high for the rest of the movie to deliver on the promise.<br/><br/>The problem is that ""1408"" happily includes about every cliché imaginable for a haunted house story. It's all there: Room getting colder, bleeding walls, light flickering, thing's moving or appearing / disappearing, pictures changing, ghosts reliving their demise, ghosts attacking the visitor... everything. Too bad there is nothing really surprising or catchy about it. The background of the room is sadly completely left in the cold after the setup that it's ""evil"" and that people died there. The main character's background gets a bit of attention after all, but I couldn't shake the feeling that it's just there so that the room can use it against him: It's left in an unfinished state, just a rough draw of a background for our hero. Until the big ""twist"" the movie still was somewhat decent, but that thing doesn't even deserve being called twist. It's so obvious from the first scene of that supposed ""twist"" that it hurts, trying to hard to make the audience wonder.<br/><br/>When the movie finished I was left really disappointed that it failed so miserably at reaching the goal it so eagerly set for itself.<br/><br/>Overall: Okay for a rental or simply watch it on TV when it gets aired."

","Not only was I able to predict the end of the film after 10 minutes, but I kept wanting to pinch myself to see if I was really in the movie theater, much like John Cusack kept wondering if he was really in the hotel room. I am a huge film buff and love all types of movies, including horror films. Perhaps what has tainted my judgement is the fact that within the past week I saw 2 works of art : ""The lives of others"" and ""La Vie en Rose."" Compared to ""real"" films, 1408 is completely pathetic despite acting efforts by two normally great actors, John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. Normally I write reviews only of movies I enjoy, but this time I felt compelled to warn people that this film is completely predictable and sometimes pathetic. Obviously this is my own personal opinion and I respect people who enjoyed this film. Just throwing that out there so that I don't get attacked!"

","I never read the book by Stephen King and so I have no idea how much of the movie depicts the book but never the less, this film was a bore. It is plagued by the same pg 13 elements that the horror movie industry is currently stuck in (lots of screaming, quick flashes, visions of a dead daughter, etc) so it is easily forgettable. The movie is nothing but John Cusack throwing objects around the room, crawling around the floor, and then repeating itself.<br/><br/>Like I said, I have never read the book so I don't know if the same events take place in the book but if that is the case, i'll be sure to stay away from reading it."
"vincentinja","4","1","3","15 October 2007"," Not as scary not as good
","Unlike many others I did not like this film. I Went to see it based upon reviews here expecting to see something different. Apart from the acting performance of Cusack (briliant) and the promising script, the film disappointed me big time. The film is a long row of scare effects and got me bored so much that I wanted to leave the theater (my girlfriend stopped me). Probably because it was announced as a ""different"" horror film and not one of many. Once again it appears to be hard to turn a scary novel into a scary film. Hard enough also considering only ""The Shining"" pulled it off when looking at Kings stories. In 1408, the much appreciated ""story"" about the child is skin deep. It made my skin crawl alright but out of utter annoyance. Somehow it seems hard every time and again for Hollywood to produce a film without a moralistic undertone. Well, undertone to say the least, it's thrown straight into your face. Once again a call upon those who have lost their faith to turn back to their fate as quick as possible because without it you not only make your own life miserable but also most certainly that of people close to you."
"apple100","5","1","3","6 October 2007"," Some things done make sense...
","Sorry but I personally did not take to this movie. 1) Samuel Jackson gives the impression that this room is so dangerous, he wont even go near it when the lift opens, you get the impression that its on a floor on its own. Yet, the Hotel stupidly gives a room to a mother and baby - next door to this dangerous room - and maids are walking about happily quite near it.<br/><br/>2) With all its dangerous things in this room, the Hotel send ONLY two people in at a time - monthly - to clean it. Common sense dictates that you would send in a team of at least 5-6 people, and one of them being the current Governor of California.<br/><br/>3) If Samuel is so concerned as he indicated - and did not want anything happen to the nitwit writer (Cusack) who goes in there, why did not his common sense dictate to him to at least have a check on his guest every 2 -3 hours? If this was reality, they don't leave the ape in there and forget about him?<br/><br/>4) The Ghost is a technophobe - amazing how it able to manage to stream Cusacks home videos into his bedroom TV.<br/><br/>I did not understand some parts of the film though. What is the message at the end? Does he really meet this daughter again? Whats the meaning or the point of him meeting his daughter again? Is the message that their is a spirit world and God does exist?"

We have this man with soooo deep past that he can only be a plastic Hollywood horror hero. And his sooo cynical personality (of course). And this sooo scary hotel room. And - who could ever know? He will change at the end because of his sooo deep mental experience. It sooo much lacks originality... Nothing new, nothing interesting, just a bunch of slightly FX'ed scenes randomly incorporated in way too long movie.

","Call me picky. Call me choosy. Call me anything you like. Just don't have the executives call me from that phone in Room 1408.<br/><br/>As a genuine fan of psychological terror in flicks, 1408 for the first 65 minutes had me creeping the crawlies - and I don't scare easy these days.<br/><br/>Not because I am in possession of a DNA strand that separates me from anyone else, but simply because I know what makes me shiver - and it's the same, primal thing that makes everyone do likewise.<br/><br/>1408, is a room split right down the middle - one end of it is so bleak, stark, horrifying and tense it's hard to visit. Every corner oozes fear, every breathing part of the structure is intent on showing you hell for the good it'll do you. That's the good end.<br/><br/>The bad end, is the end filled with Hollywood executives and money men who are ensuring they get a return on their investments. In reality, this part of 1408 is far more horrid than the other, but when film and politics mix, it all gets waxed.<br/><br/>Think 'The Haunting', 'The Exorcist', 'Don't Look Now', 'The Shining'. Think of all the sequences from these movies that gave you that gut-wrenching sense of dread and unpredictability. Keep thinking that for the first hour.<br/><br/>Then switch it off.<br/><br/>Because to be honest, what you have here is ironically one of the finest psychological horror movies made for YEARS, combined with one of the worst. I genuinely felt a bit hollow after it ended.<br/><br/>The first hour is SO good, it puts every horror flick with the exception of three or four to shame. Ever. The last 'bit', is so contrived it re-enforces the notion that Hollywood is dead, and is feeding on the brains of any unsuspecting, talented director who has the inclination, but not the balls to tell these vampires where to get off.<br/><br/>As you may be aware, there are alternative endings - not that it matters. Get to 65.00 on your player and stop it right there. Don't ruin the dream of a classic.<br/><br/>With regards to acting, sequence work and direction - everything is absolutely as you want. It's a lonely, isolated place, the dread building with every moment. You won't so much jump as sink into a feeling of genuine fear. The rhythm of the attacks are perfectly timed, giving the viewer a moment to breath - but when they do, it's either a moment too soon or a moment too late.<br/><br/>Cusack is top-notch, spanning a spectrum of emotions and playing them just so - that being up to the point when the executives made a phone call and said; ""Right, can we make it a little bit happy at the end because we don't want people complaining. Let's just make another Skeleton Key but a bit better, yeah?"". Then he just becomes John Cusack again - you can almost sense the actors disdain at the change of course, and for that I hope he gets another bite at such a fantastic cherry. Potentially.<br/><br/>The last 'bit' - and I can only refer to it as a 'bit' - is so contrived, so banal, so washed-out, watered-down and weak that it belongs in another film. As horror films go, this 'bit' is horrible to watch - but for all the wrong reasons. To be perfectly honest, I have to feel for the director.<br/><br/>You can picture Noe, Kubrick, Roeg, Lynch, Fincher and Cronenberg all sat in the same row at the theatre shaking their heads and wondering if they had enough between them to give this bloke another shot at the title.<br/><br/>It's like watching someone make a record-breaking attempt at spinning plates, albeit plates of terror, and fall short with just one more to go - you can almost hear the gasps from the audience as that last plate smashes in slow-motion onto the cold, corporate floor. For the first half they are gasps of horror and amazement - for the latter, they are gasps of surprise and shame.<br/><br/>That said, if you want to watch the first half of the best horror movie made for well over 30 years - watch 1408. If you need a reason to have a moan on the IMDb boards - watch 1408. If you're an independent movie maker and want inspiration - watch 1408. If you reckon you'll be sorely disappointed by what could have been - watch 1408.<br/><br/>Rated at 7.0 / 10 just because the first 65 is THAT GOOD. If it finished the job it set out to do, this could have been scariest, most upsetting horror flick ever, and worthy of something close to a 9.0 / 10.<br/><br/>Really. No. REALLY. This movie could have been the best in genre."

"DICK STEEL","7","1","3","30 August 2007"," A Nutshell Review: 1408
","If you believe in urban legends, there are some pretty nifty ones out there regarding hotel rooms. You know, the ones about not requesting for a room with a double bed when you're alone, or to check under the bed, cupboards for erm, extras, or the golden rule to knock before entering. Pah! you may say, but some deem them standard operating procedures as you just do not know the history behind the strange room you're going to spend the night in.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by horror maestro Stephen King, 1408 is a horror tale about an evil hotel room. It's so evil, that the entire movie for the most parts is devoted in that single room itself. You can say that the room is the star of the movie, but I'd rather give that kudos to one of my favourite character actors, John Cusack. Cusack plays writer Mike Enslin, whose popular works include his accounts in checking out supposedly haunted hotel rooms, with scientific equipment in tow and a cynical mind, to live and tell the story. He's a non-believer, but in order to get that regular paycheck, he writes what his audience wants to read.<br/><br/>Until he got an anonymous invitation to visit the Dolphin Hotel's room 1408, whose notorious history has a series of bizarre murders taking place within the confines of the room. Picking up the challenge much against the wishes of hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), here's when things start to really go bump in the night. Touted as the room where you won't last an hour in, we follow Mike Enslin as he tries to uncover just what is the mystery behind this evil force is, but like the cynic in him, we start to cast that suspecting eye on Mike himself - is he going insane, letting his dark history catch up with him, or is the room truly hell in luxurious settings? It's basically Jumanji within four walls, as wave after wave of spooky events hit Mike, and tests the limits of his sanity.<br/><br/>And there are some genuinely spooky moments in 1408, so credit goes to the film-making team in setting everything up for little climaxes in the narrative. But too much of a good thing tends to make it seem like being stuck in a repetitive loop, and before long, you'll be crying out loud for the entire episode to end, just like how Mike just wants to get out. For a small set, 1408 unleashed total mayhem onto itself, so much so that you suspect it doesn't know how to end, falling prey to the multiple ending syndrome, and at one point I was cringing that it could go along the same direction as that Nicolas Cage stinker Next. Thankfully, it didn't, but it after too much ingredients stuffed into it, the outcome was really quite bland, that its ending, with great promise, just doesn't wow, after the fatigued long drawn route to conclusion.<br/><br/>In actuality, what made this movie engaging is that John Cusack essentially does a one man show here. Fear, despair, desperation, hope, we see it all as his Mike battles with the unknown with great aplomb. He doesn't disappoint, and one of the highlights is his sparring with Samuel L Jackson as the hotel manager with an attitude. But don't hold your breaths for many scenes where they appear together. Despite having shared top billing with Cusack, Jackson got nothing more than a supporting role here, showing shades of his mo-fo attitude, before having the spotlight centered firmly on Cusack again.<br/><br/>Great buildup, effective spooky moments, but overall a rather dull affair if you piece them all together. And one thing's for sure, you'll never listen to The Carpenter's ""We've Only Just Begun"", in the same light ever again."
"chi-cerca-trova","10","1","3","27 August 2007"," Bravo!
","I will come right out and say it. I hate horror movies. I find them to be trite and too serious for their own good. I consider slasher films the bane of modern cinema, and too many stories play into the gore and sheer jump moments rather than taking the time to develop the story or characters.<br/><br/>Having said that, this is an amazing movie. Brilliantly acted and directed, with amazing cinematography and set design. A very claustophobic movie for the majority, it grips you and will not let go.<br/><br/>But, what sets this movie apart is the purely psychological nature of the movie. Sure, it has its jump moments. However, the tone of the movie is straight creepy, furthered by the aforementioned claustrophobic style of the main set piece. John Cusack and Sam Jackson are brilliant in their opposing roles, playing off of each other seamlessly, feeling completely natural.<br/><br/>The tour de force in this movie is the room of the title itself. It morphs brilliantly, each new surprise and jump effortlessly put into the action. I can't say enough about this movie.<br/><br/>If you want obnoxious blood and gore, nudity and ridiculous story and acting, this is not for you. If you want an intelligent, stylish thriller, don't be put off by the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Hitchcock would be proud"
"jellyneckr","Null","1","3","16 August 2007"," An impressive summer surprise!
","The 2000s have not been a good to horror fans. While some people love torture porn such as the Saw and Hostel films, I find them to be utterly repulsive and pointless and this is coming from a guy who loves gore (when used correctly). The alternative to these snuff films is not much better. The political climate over the years has drifted to such a PC state that almost all other horror flicks have been neutered down to a PG-13 rating, cutting out all the elements fans want to see in the process. It was with that in mind that I went to see 1408, based on the Stephen King short story I'd read when it first came out though had mostly forgotten about by the time the feature went into production. My one reason for going was the fact the adaptation was co-written by Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski, the duo responsible for writing such smart and underrated classics like Man on the Moon and People vs. Larry Flynt. It was my hope that despite the PG-13 rating, there would still be a great story. As always, Alexander and Karaszewski (along with Matt Greenberg) came through. This is the first straightforward horror picture in years to have a story and characters worth giving a hoot about. The best part of 1408 is the set-up, taking up about half an hour in the beginning to establish the lead character well played by John Cusack. Director Mikael Håfström is able to build suspense and tension with these scenes long before the frights even begin. That takes talent. Håfström makes the rest of the film visually impressive. More importantly, he is able to do so with little to no CG work. Cinematographer Benoît Delhomme has done amazing job here. Although I doubt he'll be nominated, he definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for what he has accomplished. With a near perfect look and a solid story, 1408 is recommended watching for horror fans even if the PG-13 rating is a bit of a letdown. 8/10<br/><br/>Director's Cut note: The extended director's cut contained on the two-disc DVD is a superior version with more depth and a much better ending. I give that version a 9 out of 10."
"MaxBorg89","8","1","3","14 August 2007"," A return to form for both King and Cusack
","""Stay scared"" is a line Mike Enslin (John Cusack) repeats a few times throughout this movie. It doesn't only apply to the people he talks to, but is also a message from director Mikael Håfström to the audience, one it will be hard not to pay attention to: 1408, based on a short story by Stephen King, is one of the scariest films in recent years (even more remarkable if you take into account that it's rated PG-13), and arguably the first good adaptation of the horror master's work since The Green Mile.<br/><br/>As is often the case with King, the protagonist is a writer: more precisely, Enslin specializes in finding ""haunted"" buildings and spending the night in those places, proving there is no such thing as ghosts or any other supernatural forces. One day he receives a postcard which persuades him to go to a glamorous New York hotel and ask to be given the titular room. The hotel manager, played by Samuel L. Jackson, tries to convince him it is a crazy choice, given 56 people have died in that room over the course of 95 years, and when asked what exactly caused those deaths he sums it up with a short, chilling sentence: ""It's an evil f*cking room."". Nonetheless, Enslin decides to stay in 1408, believing all the warnings he has received are merely publicity stunts. But once things start appearing and disappearing, the door gets permanently locked and a watch starts counting down from 60 minutes (the time-frame within which every previous guest died), the cynical author begins to believe he might actually have entered a room that embodies pure evil.<br/><br/>No one has ever lasted more than one hour in 1408, we are told at the beginning. Ironically, that is also how long it takes before the movie starts showing small signs of weakness, mostly plot-related: as long as he relies on psychological tension and thrills deriving from everyday objects, like Kubrick did with The Shining, Håfström has everything under control; it is when he gets to the third act and needs to come up with a satisfying solution that he slightly disappoints, the surreal mid-film twist being way too far-fetched even for a King story (the creepy epilogue, however, is just about enough to forgive that misstep).<br/><br/>Less forgivable is the choice of the supporting actors in what is essentially a one-man show: Jackson, who appears in two scenes, manages to be terrific in the first (see paragraph 2) and border on the ridiculous in the second, while there is no logical explanation for why a fine character actor like Tony Shalhoub accepted to do a 30-second cameo which adds absolutely nothing of value to the film. Only Mary McCormack, playing Mrs. Enslin, is able to partially match the painful intensity that emanates from Cusack.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the real reason to watch this movie: having not appeared in anything of relevance since 2003's Runaway Jury (where he still ended up playing second fiddle to Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman), the Grifters star is finally given the chance to really sink his teeth into quality material, and he turns out to be genuinely shocking in his second King-based role (he previously played Gordie Lachance's dead brother in Stand By Me). The most gratifying aspect of his performance is the fact he doesn't show symptoms of mad despair immediately: it worked for Jack Nicholson in The Shining, but that was Nicholson; Cusack, who has always gone for a subtler approach to his roles, lets the panic out gradually, making his crazier antics in the picture's second half more believable. The same goes for the back-story: normally, a character's tragic past is thrown in right away to make the audience feel sorry, although it generally causes the opposite effect; this movie's three screenwriters, on the other hand, unveil the dramatic subplot slowly, bit by bit, so that by the time it is tied to present events it is actually possible to care for the people involved.<br/><br/>A great premise, consistent suspense and a mesmerizing central performance: those are three valid reasons why lovers of the horror genre should watch 1408. Dodgy ""twist"" toward the end and largely irrelevant secondary cast aside, this film has enough assets to ensure King fans will, to paraphrase Mike Enslin, stay scared."

There is some parts for comedy, (i wont say when) but it is not laugh out loud comedy, like after a scary part, to some it might be funny, and to others he is just going crazy (in the movie). But overall: 6/10! Last the overall vote. I Really enjoyed this film, and can't wait till it comes out on DVD!! But the overall rating is 10/10! this is one of the best horror films of 2007, the other is Disturbia. But, this one is for people who like supernatural horror films and just like being scared out of their wits!

John Cusack played very well and i think Samuel L Jackson played an intriguing roll. the film is in the middle of a horror-drama-thriller-scary movie. and to all nonbelievers of ghost now is time to believe in weird things,in weird ""rooms"",evil things which are happening in our life and we can't explain them to us. . I'm Bogdan from Romania,Brasov and i think the film must be rated 9 or 10. So now i will advise you to watch this movie and post a comment about this movie and let odors now how scary is this 1408"

","A Stephen King short story returns to the big screen in a powerful movie about a skeptic who debunks haunted places by insisting that ghosts don't exist and therefore every supposedly haunted place has been the imagination of the guests, occupants or just good old fashion tall tales.<br/><br/>This movie was excellent and kept your interest throughout. John Cusak gives a great, almost one man performance, as he insists on staying in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York City.<br/><br/>The movie is in typical Stephen King style and leaves you wondering about the facts up to the final scene.<br/><br/>I recommend 1408 to anyone who likes a little scare in their life or anyone who had a vivid dream or nightmare that seems so real they can't believe it was just a dream.<br/><br/>Stephen King...great."

","WOW, was this ever good.<br/><br/>I was excited for this immediately after seeing the trailer, and after seeing that the reviews lived up to it, I was doubly so.<br/><br/>John Cusack, who is alone on screen for about 80% of the film, does a superb job as always. His emotional range is amazing, and at times in the film, it takes him nothing more than a facial expression to drag you right down into the emotional hell his character Michael Enslin is currently trapped in.<br/><br/>The scares in the film are absolutely breathtaking, ranging from shocks to carefully built suspense, and the emotional catharises verge on tear-jerking.<br/><br/>Back it all up with a very solid supporting performance from Samuel L Jackson, and you've got a true must-see.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Shinobu_Sensui","8","1","3","29 June 2007"," The best Horror Film since The Grudge
","Years of Slasher film after Slasher film have been brought to an end with the release of 1408. This has to be the best film released since 300.<br/><br/>The story goes like this- A man named Mike has a career of debunking legends of places being haunted. His next place is a hotel in New York called the Dolphin. Room 1408 on the top floor, is rumored to be haunted. When Mike goes to check in the manager takes him to his(the manager's) office. There, the manager insists that Mike not stay in 1408. His attempts fail however, and eventually he gives in and escorts Mike to 1408.<br/><br/>At first everything seems normal, however, strange things start happening. The radio goes on by itself, the window slams shut while Mike just happens to have his hand through it. A strange apparition attacks Mike with a weapon. And Mike hears the voice of his daughter, who died a year ago. Eventually more bizarre things start to happen and Mike, unable to get out of the room, must battle the mind tricks and attacks of a room that is trying to drive him to suicide.<br/><br/>The Good -- First of all, the acting from Jackson and Cuzak is well done, as is the acting of Mike's wife. <br/><br/>This film is genuinely scary. From the siren that causes Mike to nearly fall from the ledge he is attempting to cross in order to get to the window of another hotel room to the scene where the noose for Mike to hang himself appears, to the painting of the old woman reading a story to deranged children. It is almost terrifying.<br/><br/>The Bad -- Not enough time ios spent detailing Mike's profession.<br/><br/>This takes me back to the classic horror of the 20s-70s. I hope t directs horror back to a more atmospheric approach and away from hack and slash."
"I_Was_Incepted","10","1","3","28 June 2007"," 1408 = good
","Ruining precisely how things go bump would be spoiling most of the fun of 1408. The usual slamming shut and sudden disquieting aside, 1408 is more creepy than outright scary and much of its success is due to John Cusack's performance. Praise is long overdue on Cusack as one of our best everyman actors who can convey just enough cynicism and yet still allow an audience to root for him. This is never more evident in the pre-room scenes, particularly those with Jackson, sparring wits with another master of matter-of-fact delivery, but Cusack also sails through the film's more questionable turns with a command of the situation. For all the additions made to Stephen King's short story, it's a shame the screenwriters missed the obvious allegorical connotations to the final decision Enslin is presented with. A stronger metaphor for life in the face of death there could not have been, but I'm satisfied enough with 1408 being a stronger horror film in the face of garbage like Hostel Part II.<br/><br/>Jens Naeyaert"
"ChiefGoreMongral","6","1","3","25 June 2007"," Goremongral's Review: 1408
","John Cusack has always been one of my favorite actors...come on the guy has made some kick ass movies and my personal favorite 80's comedy ""Better Off Dead""!!! Enough of that though John always seems to go for the not so normal film which I love but in this case ""1408"" we get a movie that offers entertainment, but only in moderation.<br/><br/>Cusack stars as Mike Enslin a paranormal investigator/writer of sorts that goes to all the hot haunt spots then writes a review of the stay and its general creepiness. One day he receives a postcard for a place called the Dolphin Hotel which has an infamous room 1408 that so happens to have killed a lot of people. After talking with the manager of the hotel Gerald Olin (played by Samuel L. Jackson) who all but begs him not to stay in the room Mike proceeds to stay in the room for the night.<br/><br/>Mr Olin tells Mike that no one has survived for more than 1 hour in the room. Shore enough after some minimal meandering the alarm clock goes crazy and shows a countdown timer of 60 minutes and begins a countdown. From there Mike has to endure a living hell as visions of past and present collide attempting to cause him to end his life and the suffering.<br/><br/>The movie is a sort of cerebral haunted house film that works in parts and in others not quite as well. This is due to some rather mediocre scenes that really do not pay off and end up being a tad boring. There is some entertaining things here don't get me wrong, the humor is typical dead pan Cusak and the scenes with Mike and Gerald are really well done and there are some good scenes of suspense here and there but I left the theater feeling like there was so much more that they could have done here to make for a complete thriller experience.<br/><br/>Do to some lulls in the story and some parts that went on a tad to long at times I give 1014 a modest yet slightly better than average score of: 6/10: Above Average: haunted house fans don't expect to see tons of ghouls and specters but those into head trips and mind games in the paranormal realm take a look. Just be prepared for a mediocre middle act that could have been so much more."

Warning:please do not watch this film if you do not like films that kick at you from within but give you the choice to accept their premise or not. This film was most definitely much better than early Spring release of ""The Reaping"". The acting is top notch and the directing is better than most of his genre. Think ""12 Monkeys"", ""The Others"" and ""The Exorcist"" all rolled into one as this is one of the few films that were meant to frighten you and shall we say it more than delivers, however the ending apparently was tested by audience approval so it may not be everyone's cup of tea and I will definitely want to see the DVD when it comes out to see the other possible alternative endings.

","I went into the theaters knowing I would get my moneys worth, and I ended up getting more than expected. The story is just awesome, now I never read the short story by Stephen King but I am sure those who read it will believe the movie follows it well. John Cusack puts on a great performance, I just loved it. Samuel L. Jackson may not be in the movie for long, but his appearance is quite entertaining and I think he plays the role of the hotel manager very well. There are even some good laughs in this film which is surprising due to the fact that it is horror. It had good jump moments no doubt about it, and there were creepy moments that just sucked you into the movie. The film was so good that after the film, I had to search online to see if there was an actual Dolphin Hotel in New York.

","This is the best scary film since the original Haunting with Julie Harris. At the level of the Ring, Legend of Hell House, the Others and Dark Water. 1408 has its own style and got quite a good reaction from the leaving crowd. The film builds and turns very intense. Some incredible vertigo dizzy scenes and a tremendous mirror scene as well as genuinely scary scenes.<br/><br/>The underlying story is excellent and is woven into the plot through the end of the movie. The following sentence is a super spoiler. The last shot and recording that confuses some viewers was brilliant. The recording pounds home that something was real. There may be some other interpretations but I believe it is clear.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film which has no agenda. The film has very little swearing or gore with no love scenes. It is actually OK for most ages and the terror is not brutal or cruel. It is old fashioned scare fest with good acting. Sam Jackson gives his usual good performance in a small role. I only give it one star because the film is so classic and good and seems out of place in the large amounts of trash films recently. This is a great film with a fine ending that is not a set up for a sequel."

From ""The Sure thing to Serendipity. He is a very underrated actor.<br/><br/>But this is one movie I think he would like to forget.<br/><br/>He lays Michael Enslin a cynical writer who debunks a lot of these so called haunted houses and the people claim they live in.<br/><br/>He gets a post card from ""The Dolphin Hotel "" telling him to not stay in room 1408. After many calls from him and his publisher's lawyers he goes to the hotel and asks to stay in 1408.<br/><br/>The Manager keeps telling him not to go into that room, any room but that room since there is pure evil in this room.<br/><br/>It keeps you wondering what is really and what is not. It twists and turns away too much and Mr.Cusack seems to overplay the part in this one.<br/><br/>My suggestion rent it when it comes out in a couple of months.

"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","12","29 January 2008"," Refreshing and original.
","In this present time, in which most of the currently being released horror movies are mostly all the same, ""1408"" is a refreshing and welcome addition to the genre.<br/><br/>""1408"" is mostly a movie that distinct itself in its build-up of the tension. It provides the movie with some original and genuine scare moments but when it comes down to the overall and 'old fashioned' style of horror, this movie just isn't among the best. No way ""1408"" will be one of the scariest movies you'll ever see but it will be a movie that will perhaps make you jump and raise your heartbeat at some moments but above all it will be a movie that you'll enjoy watching, since its such a well made and acted one.<br/><br/>This movie is a rare case of an horror movie that is actually made better by its special effects. Most of the time the special effects in modern horror movies are totally lame and take away lots of the tension and actual horror of the movie. This movie uses its special effects really well and it of course also really helps that the special effects are top-class. The use of special effects is also another reason why ""1408"" works quite original, since it provides the movie with a couple of unique and also good looking moments.<br/><br/>The story on its own is kept pretty simple, as it should be. It's based on a short story by Stephen King. The movie nevertheless still has some twists and turns, though most genre fans and fans of Stephen King will see most of these twist coming from miles away. But that's sort of OK. It doesn't really downgrade the movie that it's fairly predictable all, mostly because its such a fine made and enjoyable movie to watch. It still sort of bother me that none of the, obvious unusual, events happening in the movie get ever 'explained', which in my opinion is just a cheap and simple way of horror film-making, as if you're telling the viewers; just take it all for what it is and don't bother to think about because we are too lazy to give an explanation for any of it and we just want to make a horror movie that will scare you, without you ever knowing why and how these events in the movie are all happening.<br/><br/>What I always like about John Cusack is that he is no big movie star, even though he has played in more than a few blockbusters and acclaimed movies. He still very natural and 'untouched'. He is not the sort of guy that ever steps into the spot-lights, though he still really seems like a nice guy in real life. He always gives movies something special, without really having to do much for it. His acting is most of the time mostly subtle and to a lot of people will seem like he is always playing the same type of characters. He's also really in his element in this movie and he makes the movie even more enjoyable to watch. For most of the time he is the only actor on screen, so he has to Carry the movie mostly on his own, with mostly the help of the professional film-makers involved, which makes this a good and also good looking one to watch.<br/><br/>All in all ""1408"" will not go down in history as one of the best horror movies of this decade but it is a very refreshing, enjoyable and well made and good looking one, that will still also certainly provides more than a couple of scares. A movie that will please the genre fans, as well as those who aren't really into horror.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

But it really is unfortunately, considering how great older horror was. This movie just failed to scare me at all. I'll admit, the acting was the best part of the movie, and the storyline was great. It was just WAY too over-the-top once the action started. It seemed to stop making sense and just kept trying to be scary/shocking, causing it to fail in both.

The plot of 1408 was terrific. (at least the set up) The actors were good. Cusack was excellent. Some of the scenes and situations were brilliant.. (SPOILER) the clock and the song, the chocolates on the pillow, the ghosts jumping out of the window, seeing himself in the apartment, the whole first scene with Samuel L. Jackson, were fantastic. I was actually scared...on the edge of my seat, too scared to eat my popcorn, scared. Then, frustratingly, the whole thing fell apart.<br/><br/>Why must King. and whoever makes his books into movies, loose restraint and resort to wallowing in a total mess of nonsense? This happens repeatedly. It happened with Rose Red. (again, good plot, interesting back story with the website and book, etc, good first half, and then....crap.) This movie needed an editor...someone to say, ""Wait. Let's get back on track here."" We don't need to blow up the room again.""

The last one 40 minutes or so are kind of drag though, you feel like OK lets get done with it. John Kusack also never looked like he is fully into it.

After slowly gaining your interest the star, who may I add basically acts the whole movie himself,(true talent) checks into 1408 despite the discouragement from Samuel L. Jackson. Once he enters the movie starts up like a horror masterpiece, the star finds himself in a completely normal hotel. Without spoiling the movie for anyone once the **** hits the fan, the movie shows its true colors. Each ghost perfectly placed to send chills down your spine.

His fight with the room leads for a few dry, quirky, and quite humorous moments in the movie. Samuel Jackson doesn't yell in this movie and really has a small part in it.

I just got home from watching it's release in Philly and I walked out of the theater a little unfilled.

"BA_Harrison","8","1","9","27 September 2007"," Cusack checks in for a night of terror in this excellent Stephen King adaptation.
","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a writer who, after the death of his daughter, has given up on life. Separated from his wife, he squanders his talent writing guidebooks on America's most haunted hotels, despite being quite convinced that life after death is a fallacy.<br/><br/>When Mike receives a postcard warning him not to stay in room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel, NY, he can't resist the challenge. He books the room, and, despite being repeatedly warned by the hotel's manager (Samuel L. Jackson) not to do so, he checks in for a night of unspeakable terror that drives him to the edge of sanity.<br/><br/>Based on a story by Stephen King book, 1408 is a terrific thrill-ride that managed the almost impossible task of freaking me out. Cusack gives a bravura performance as the man forced to face his demons whilst trapped in the hotel room from hell. Carrying the film almost entirely on his own, he convincingly portrays a man who, faced with unspeakable horror, gradually loses his marbles and possibly his will to live.<br/><br/>Even before Enslin enters 1408, director Mikael HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m ensures that the tension is made unbearable by having Jackson's character repeatedly warn the writer against the idea, telling him of the dreadful history of the room and the numerous people who have died there. By the time our protagonist steps across the threshold of the malevolent room, the audience is on tenterhooks, nervously awaiting the first inevitable sign of trouble.<br/><br/>HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m then carefully cranks up the tension by having his character gradually realise that all is not as it should be in 1408. At first Enslin is his usual sceptical self when confronted with the unexplained: he suspects that someone in his room is playing tricks on him. As the terror escalates, however, Mike realises that he has made a grave mistake and tries to leave, but it is too late... room 1408 has a new victim.<br/><br/>Mixing moments of absolute fear (Enslin's attempts at escaping the room are nail-biting exercises in tension) with pure shock horror (a couple of moments are guaranteed to have you leaving your seat), 1408 is a very effective movie. Only towards the end, when events spiral out of control and perhaps become a little too melodramatic, does the film lose some of its power, but this is a minor quibble and one that does little to spoil one's enjoyment of the film. Freaky, creepy and downright unnerving, this is one of the best King adaptations in a long time, and highly recommended viewing."

","Review:
'1408' is an American psychological-horror directed by Mikael HÃ¥fstrÃ¶m. It is based on Stephen King's short story of the same name. This is in my 'Top 5' Stephen King movies of all time. I think this movie is very underrated and is really something special.
The film follows Mike Enslin (John Cusack), an author who investigates allegedly haunted houses and rents the titular room 1408 at a New York City hotel. Although skeptical of the paranormal, he is soon trapped in the room where he experiences bizarre events.
While there are some other minor characters in the movie, John Cusack is in every scene of this movie and there are a lot of scenes where it's just him stuck in this hotel room. He is fantastic in this movie, and nobody should be able to say otherwise without being able to say exactly what he did wrong, this performance is flawless in my eyes. He starts off being a dick and you're not sure is your going to like the character or not, then we learn more about his past and can sympathise a bit and then starts to happen and the way he portrays the character differently in between these scenes really make his character dynamic.
The thing that makes this movie stand out over a lot of the other paranormal movies out there, is that usage of tension building and the fact the movie is trying to make you feel uncomfortable rather than out right scar you using psychological elements in the film. There is nothing I can think of that I don't like in this movie. It starts out strong introducing us to our main character and finding out what he does and why he is important for the story, has a great middle bringing tension and scares when necessary without overdoing the jump scares, and a strong twist of an ending.
Overall, I love this movie, I think anybody can at least enjoy this movie if they're fan of Stephen King and thriller films. I can't believe I'm, going to give a horror/thriller film this rating, but this one deserves it.
5/5"

","What a creepy, scary movie! I don't normally enjoy supernatural horror stories as I find them rather ridiculous but this one was something else.
It's about a writer who travels around finding haunted places to stay and writing about them. He is a total sceptic and ridicules the notion of ghosts and phantoms and those that spread the stories. His opinions however are turned upside down when he stays at the Dolphin Hotel room 1408.
Samuel L Jackson plays the hotel manager and tries to convince him not to stay in the room. His warnings are ignored with great regret. John Cusack plays the writer very convincingly.<br/><br/>I gave this 8 because I actually found it very scary."

Strangely, its not some much the John Cusack gives an Oscar performance rather that the script and special effects work so well with his acting and on-screen time that the combination is a special, heightened horror experience that one has not witnessed in years.

The ending (of the theatrical version that I saw) is very weak indeed.

"Aly200","6","0","1","9 July 2016"," The Haunted Hotel and the Skeptic
","Leave it to Stephen King to write a short story about another haunted hotel. This time instead of Jack Torrance, we have paranormal writer Mike Enslin, a complete non-believer in the supernatural until he steps foot into the allegedly haunted Dolphin Hotel. Chaos soon unleashes itself on the writer when he dares to stay in the haunted room 1408 and Mike is soon made a believer in otherworldly phenomena. <br/><br/>Playing the key role of Mike Enslin is Chicago actor John Cusack. Cusack brings his trademark dry wit to the paranormal writer, but also is able to bring out the character's insecurities. Convincingly portraying a broken man who is at odds with those around him after a terrible tragedy prior to the film's events. His past mistakes come back to haunt him as he begins to be tormented by 1408's sinister atmosphere. Cusack keeps the overacting down until he finally lets loose in the film's grand finale as Mike Enslin sets out to end the curse of 1408 even at his own expense.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is relatively generic in the ""haunted house"" genre. There's the hotel manager (a subdued Samuel L. Jackson) who warns the skeptic of the haunted spot's danger zone to which the protagonist ignores the warning. Room 1408's haunting is pretty simple as it messes with the setting around Cusack's Enslin from unexplained noises to placing Enslin in some unknown setting or tormenting him psychologically with his past traumas. Ultimately in true Stephen King fashion, the hero is overcome by the evil force around them and consumed with stopping the horror from claiming more.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film, but there are enough scary moments to entertain the viewer."

I am not sure that is the genre it goes under but it seems like the right one to me. It is a movie that leaves you with a lot of questions and things to think about. It has a slow start to the movie that helps build up to the integral scenes in the hotel.Samuel L Jackson role is this movie is also very important. He helps build up the fear of the room in the first place so we gain the anticipation. my favorite scene is when he plays the tape at the end and her mom hears her voice on the tape"
"jmhammerstein-980-842586","10","0","1","23 March 2016"," wonderful movie
","1408 is a wonderful movie. The plot is a man named Mike Enslin goes to supposedly haunted places for a living and writes horror books based on his experiences. He has never found evidence of the paranormal and is convinced that there is none. He finds out about stories of bad things that happened in room 1408 at a hotel in New York City and decides he wants to stay a night in that room. After a while of everything seeming normal, weird things start to happen. The movie is very scary and creepy. After Mike gets to the hotel, the manager, unlike other people where he stays who are happy for him to stay in the bedroom or hotel room or whatever, DOESN'T want him to stay to the degree where he begs him not to. This is slightly funny and Mike dismisses him as either crazy or messing with him. There is a point in the movie early during the supernatural parts where Mike is trapped in the room and he sees someone in a room in another building directly across from him and yells at the guy and signals for help and the guy starts mimicking him and it comes to appear as if the guy has become Mike's reflection in a mirror. This seems more the case when you see the guy looks like Mike. This seems like Mike was slipped some kind of very powerful hallucinatory drug by Gerald Olin, the hotel manager, and that is an early part of a period of extreme hallucinations. Maybe. Maybe not. The theatrical ending, which is the ending I like best, has Mike playing a tape to his wife that has their dead daughter Katie talking to him which shocks her. Maybe. It might also be that Mike's wife went into the room without that being shown in the movie and the room trapped her and what she thought she experienced after that was an illusion created by the room for her and it was revealing that it had her and wasn't going to let her go by having the fake room Mike play the tape of the real Mike saying I've got you now. I'm not going to let you go when he was talking to Katie. Although I don't know how Mike's wife would ever get into the room because there's a scene where she's outside of the hotel and sees fire exploding out of the windows of 1408."
"schroeder-gustavo","7","0","1","20 February 2016"," Solid Horror Flick
","1408 is a movie that relies much more on old-school scares than what you see in most horror films these days. It's a movie that relies on deep psychological horror and building tension rather than cheap and unnecessary, ineffective jump scares. This is something I love about 1408.<br/><br/>The movie follows Mike Enslin, a not so successful writer that writes about ""haunted"" hotels, rooms, cemeteries and such. What is interesting about his character is the fact that he is a skeptic. He has never seen anything to make him believe in ghosts or in the paranormal. Interestingly though, this was also kind of a flaw for me, because it does make the character more interesting, but at the same time it sets up the later events of the film a little too perfect for me. Even if you knew nothing about the plot of this film, within the first 5 minutes of it you would know exactly where it's going, so it makes the movie predictable. You know the character will undergo some kind of cathartic situation that will make him change his mind, which is great, but predictable.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, John Cusack as Enslin is good, nothing outstanding but he does get the job done. Samuel L. Jackson is also in the film as the hotel manager. I thought he was miscast. The fact that he's Sam Jackson and knowing his roles of the past distracted me, however he does a great job with the material he is given.<br/><br/>The build up to the room and the first few minutes in the room are brilliant. Definitely the best parts of the movie, because the tension is great. After the first few minutes in the room, the movie does, unfortunately, slow down and begins to roll downhill. The tension starts to fade away and the movie feels way too slow, even a little boring at times. It does pick up the pace at times and regain speed, but those scenes that are slow do take you out of the movie.<br/><br/>There are certain things in 1408 that also make no sense: If it's established early in the film by Samuel L. Jackson that electronics do not function in 1408, why is there a TV and a radio in there and why do they work even before things start to escalate? Just don't say electronics don't work in the room and it would have worked fine. At a point in the film, Enslin starts to see like TV projections of the people that killed themselves. We see this woman jump out of the window and kill herself. Then, when Enslin climbs out of the window and tries to get back in, the same projection tries to kill him, although we did see her every move before and she definitely did not try to kill anyone. If the room is so smart and evil and even turns on the water sprinklers at one point to wreck Enslin's laptop, how come it didn't notice his intentions when he wanted to literally burn the room and start sprinkling away? Like I said, Sam Jackson does the best he can with the material, but some of his lines are just retarded. Like when he says ""It's an evil f'ing room"". Also the electronics situation which is just not true. But the worst one is at the end when he's just sitting in his room with a cigar and his glass of scotch and says ""Well done Mr. Enslin, well done."" or something like that. Welcome to schlock town. Why is Enslin's first book even mentioned at the beginning of the film if it has no payoff whatsoever. Great setup for something but absolutely no payoff. Are we supposed to interpret that he started writing his horror books after his daughter died? It's never really explained or made clear at which point in his life he started writing the books. The things with the daughter were interesting, it gave the character depth and stuff the room could mess around with to alter him. But what's up with his dad? He's in one scene and it's never mentioned ever again.<br/><br/>In the end, 1408 is a flawed movie, sure. But the flaws I have with it are almost exclusively with the script. But I can't deny the fact that it's a well made movie. I love how it starts to build tension and there are absolutely no stupid cheap jump scares in the movie. Almost no blood, the movie is almost purely psychological. It's a solid horror movie, an entertaining one and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who can appreciate a good psychological horror movie.<br/><br/>7.0/10"

","First off, I am a big fan of Stephen King's books and, apart from The Shining, I don't much care for the movie versions (obviously for reasons of space they leave way too much out). This is a movie version of a King book, though one I've not read. So we find Mike Enslin, a spectacularly unsuccessful author (relegated to paperback book bins, as one of this film's characters refers) undertaking research for a book about hauntings. He is a sceptic and has no belief in god, ghosts or any paranormal bulldust. He hears about this hotel in Manhattan and decides to book a night in the infamous room 1408. He attempts to book 'the room' and is told it's not available, a lawyer tells him he can due to some legal technicality which I didn't get. Anyways, he ends up in 1408 and his night of terror begins. Although the ""night in a haunted house"" scenario has been done to death, Mikæl Håfström for the most part effectively plays his audience with an eerie, often jarring, soundtrack, clever cutting, and a minimum of effects. ""1408"" is a ghost story, not a horror or slasher flick. It is much more about the 'unseen' terror – and this he achieves with panache. John Cusack is brilliant as the beleaguered ""soon-to-be-new-ghost"" character AND I loved Samuel L. Jackson. He gives a chilling performance as a manager whose intent is ignored. I also kind of got the feeling his character was one of the many ghosts. The music was unmemorable and the stupid radio kept playing ""We've Only Just Begun"" a song I loath. The graphics/GCI were very fine, indeed. I loved the various people leaping from the window!"

","In celebration of my 1408th review, I had revisit one of the only few ghost/haunted dwellings I can tolerate. (The Shining is the only other one that comes to mind)<br/><br/>Since I don't believe in ghosts, haunted houses or any sort of unintentionally hilarious Paranormal chapter, it's generally hard for me to get into them or even be a bit frightened. It doesn't help that 99% of them fall in the same trap of unoriginal material, i.e. family puts all their money into a house they got a great deal on only to be slowly tormented by some variation of the usually angered previous resident blah, blahthey can't afford to move, medium kinda helpsyada, yadathey find a way out at the 11th hour but only to leave the screen door open for a shameless sequel.<br/><br/>1408 threw that all out and finally came up with something fresh. Well, in 2007, that is. (Sadly, the 10,992 haunted house movies that's come since said F that! We're going back to the clichés!)<br/><br/>Love the story of (pretty much me) writer, Mike – played brilliantly by Cusack, who not only doesn't believe in ghosts, but travels around to debunk the so-called haunted areas in his books. It wouldn't be much of a movie if he didn't finally find one that was actually haunted.<br/><br/>The buildup to Mike checking into the title's hotel room was incredible from both Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. And a ton of what happens in the room and surrounding was extremely effective. (My biggest scare was the ledge, but then, I still don't believe in the supernatural and I'm afraid of heights.)<br/><br/>I loved the twist on the haunted story. Wish they'd do more of these original stories – course, it's mostly thanks to the brilliant mind of Stephen King who ALWAYS thinks outside the box. Sadly, America just wants the same old crap recycled at least twice a year. The overkill was tedious four years ago and the unoriginal haunted house stories continue. Laughably, most are supposedly based on true events. <br/><br/>Bring back this kind of greatness (and, yeah, the other King masterpiece, The Shining) and I will renew my faith in the washed-up subgenre."

","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a cynical skeptic based in LA who writes about haunted hotels and other places. His first book holds some promising insights but he has settled into a rut. He is still haunted by a lost. He gets a postcard from Dolphin Hotel in NYC warning him against going to room 1408. It gets his attention but they won't book him in that room. He threatens to sue to get the room but hotel manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) still vehemently warns him not to stay in that room. The room seems ordinary at first except for a broken thermostat, a baby next door and a few odd stains. Then things start to happen. He tries to leave but he is trapped. He sees visions of past guests, his father, his wife Lily (Mary McCormack) and their daughter.<br/><br/>This is essentially a haunted house movie. The setup is very nice. Samuel L. Jackson does a terrific job. The main missing element is another character to bounce Cusack off of. Compared to another King story-turn-movie 'The Shining', Nicholson has his family to act against. Cusack is able to do a great one-person show for the most part. The constant changing visions work well."
"SanteeFats","8","0","1","1 March 2015"," Not bad at all
","I like John Cusack. He usually plays an understated role and excels at it. In this movie he is an atheistic man who has no believe in anything supernatural and has written several books on the subjects. UNTIL he checks into room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. Samuel L. Jackson is the Dolphin Hotel manager and does everything in his power to keep Cusack out of room 1408. To no avail of course. Turns out there have been over fifty deaths in the room, from natural ones (?) to suicides. The hotel will no longer rent the room out until Cusack shows up. In this room Cusack finally meets his truth, well at least in this movie. He tries to escape through the duct system and runs into a couple of nightmares. He gets dumped back into the room but continues to see things. Flashbacks appear to show that Cusack was married and had a little girl with some disease. When this daughter apparently dies it seems to be what lead him to lose his faith in God. This seems to be the cause of all his writings. Towards the end of the film he is really hallucinating, the pictures on the walls not only come alive but gets dragged into a sea scene. Any way this is an entertaining show. Fopr the very end Watch It."
"bradman1118","9","0","1","14 November 2014"," a tense, fast-paced, edge of your seat thriller/horror movie that messes with your mind!
","1408 follows the story of a writer (John Cusack) who spends the night at supposedly haunted places, takes notes and observations, and proves that they are not haunted. His goal is to one day experience a supernatural event. One day he spends the night at a haunted hotel room in New York City and becomes trapped in and must fight for his life. Unlike most paranormal/ghost movies (i.e., Paranormal Activity, the Conjuring, etc.), 1408 is actually fast-paced and exciting. I like movies that take their time building tension, but this one gets into the action right away and the suspense and terror does not let up. Much of this is supported by a strong performance from John Cusack, who captures his character and the horrible situation he is in perfectly. The movie gets more and more crazy as it goes along and it is very unpredictable. Rather than following the clichéd pattern where each scene is a buildup to a jump-scare, the movie actually goes in unexpected directions and takes abrupt twists. The thing I loved most about 1408 was the psychological anxiety experienced by the viewer while watching. The movie gets inside your head and makes you think about whether certain things are real or if they are illusions from the room. In conclusion, 1408 is a great horror movie that sucks you into the story. It is definitely worth watching for anyone who likes psychological horror rather than blatant violence and cheap jump-scares."

","There have been plenty of haunted houses: Poltergeist, House, and Amityville Horror immediately come to mind, but how many haunted hotel rooms have there been? 1408 is about a writer, Michael Enslin (John Cusak), who writes about haunted hotels and motels. He debunks many myths of haunted locations until he tries room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in New York.<br/><br/>Almost immediately the hotel room begins to give you chills. On top of that it was played up very well by the hotel manager played by Samuel L. Jackson. He didn't chillingly rundown the hotel room's history, rather he matter-of-factly stated its bane in an attempt to keep Mr. Enslin from staying there. Of course he failed at that and so we were treated to the hair-raising ride that was Michael's stay in 1408.<br/><br/>There are startling moments, eerie moments and even depressing moments. The room, and the movie merges from creepy to scary to massively depressing within the span of an hour.<br/><br/>If you already have hang ups about haunted locations then this movie will give you a thrill. If you are looking to be scared from beginning to end, then this isn't the movie for you. The movie centers around one character and you can only be kept on edge for so long awaiting someones peril. Eventually, you and the character will say, ""just end it already."""

","This outstanding movie, definitely does not lack for excitement. Only 5 minutes into watching this movie, as I was preparing for bed, very late at night, (early A.M.), as I began to go to bed, I could NOT peel myself away from this great movie. No doubt this movie is one of the best thrillers, yet is not a gory film. The content is 2nd to none for movies of adventure and thrill, as well as very well written drama. Not many movies can grab my attention so quickly, and shortly into the story, without letting go of my attention, like 1408 does and did. Needless to say, I got 3 hours of sleep due to staying up late, way beyond bedtime to finish this film, rather than watch it on DVR the next day. 1408 is the kind of film, which grabs the viewer from its inception, and only gets better, growing more intense with each passing minute. John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson, are both perfect for the roles they were cast in. I cannot think of two actors who could of made this movie with the same intensity, and curiosity of both great actors. I was never a big Cusack fan either before I watched this film. Now I am, and this may be the role of Cusacks career. If you haven't seen this movie your doing yourself a disfavor. I am stunned this movie has not received the higher ratings from IMDb viewers who rated this movie. Perhaps they voted with their conscious rather than their hearts. This movie on its own merit, deserves to be ranked right along all the other great movies of its genre (of which the movie can easily be categorized by genre under: thriller, drama, action, even comedy at many a moment). Do yourself a favor you will NOT regret, watch this movie. It is one of the few movies in the last decade which grabbed my interests and attention without thinking of letting go. A 10 star movie if their ever was one. Kudos..."

","I wish I watched the official ending. I don't remember clearly but I think I watched ""1408"" when the DVD released. I rented it. The ending was the original one which differs from the one that people watched in theaters. I found it really depressing and gave 5 stars on IMDb at that time. Here, about 6 years later, I only remembered the bitter feeling after I watched it the first time and forgot most of the scenes or even its story line. So I decided to watch it again on Netflix. The ending was as same as I watched before, but this time I thought this is actually a quite good horror. However I still didn't like the ending. It is such a downer. I often read reviews on IMDb before and after I watch a movie and I realized that there are a few alternative endings, moreover, the ending that I know is not an official ending!! So I googled it and found it. It is much much much better ending than the others. If I watched it 6 years ago, I would have rated this movie at 8 probably.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend to people, who watched the depressing DVD version ending, to watch the official one. You might end up changing the rate of this movie."

"callanvass","8","0","3","16 November 2013"," A rare occurrence when P.G horror shines (MAJOR SPOILERS!)
","This review is for the Director's cut<br/><br/>Mike Enslin is a depressed atheist, who has lost his daughter due to illness. He's separated from his wife, and is bored of debunking paranormal occurrences in haunted places, and wants to find something that is real. He gets interested in the infamous room at the Dolphin Hotel, room 1408. The manager (Samuel L. Jackson) gives Cusack a caveat to not go into the room. He offers him fancy booze, private files from the room, and all the accommodations you could think of, New York Knicks tickets included. Mike Enslin ignores him, and goes into the room anyway. Not only does the hotel end up frightening him, but it toys with him as well. <br/><br/>I'm a rated R guy. I don't like P.G horror films. It's not that I always want a gore drenched movie, but when you are Rated R, you're not so limited. 1408 surprised the hell out of me, not only with the high amount of competence, but how creative and sinister it was. It's also been a really long time where I have squirmed wherever I was sitting. Despite the P.G limitations, this was oozing style, and there were many times I felt trapped and highly uncomfortable from that room, due to its undeniable mystique. They put a lot of emphasis on the room, and the effort paid off. You wouldn't catch me in there for all the money in the world. This hotel is a mean bastard! There is no line it won't cross to intimidate you in the most sadistic ways imaginable. Mikael Håfström is masterful at raising tension levels. There were many neat tricks that were thrown my way. The scene where Cusack tries to climb out the window, onto the ledge to get into another room was terrific. The way they made the building look much bigger gave me the willies. I'm sort of afraid of heights, so that was pretty creepy. I found the family storyline to be absolutely riveting. The flashback scenes of Cusack, his daughter & his wife chilled me to the bone. Even though John Cusack's character is a bit bigoted in the first half, I couldn't help but feel for him, because he was in despair. His showcase was fantastic, and I feel it's one of the best performances of his illustrious career. He goes through so many emotions, and conveys them all to near perfection. This is his movie, and we are embarking on his harrowing journey. Cusack has to be one of Hollywood's most unheralded actors. It was pretty powerful stuff. Samuel L. Jackson doesn't have a ton of screen time, but his intensity knows no bounds. He was great. Mary McCormack adds solid support as Cusack's separated wife. It's one of the most thought provoking horror films you will find. It makes you realize life is so short, and that living your life in such a selfish way, benefits nobody. I couldn't stop thinking about it for a while. <br/><br/>These are my thoughts on the two endings I saw. The director's cut & the theatrical cut. If you don't want to know, stop reading this instant. Don't say I didn't warn you <br/><br/>Director's Cut ending<br/><br/>Cusack burning the room and dying so he can get out of the hotel was very depressing. He passes away, and the hotel manager approaches Lilly to offer Cusack's belongings. Lilly denies it, and Jackson winds up seeing Cusack's burned body in the car in the backseat. They also show Mike Enslin & his daughter reunited, going up to heaven. The ending was rather deflating. After everything Mike went through, this crushed me. At least it has some semblance of happiness, but it was rather morbid<br/><br/>Theatrical Ending<br/><br/>I honestly prefer the theatrical ending. It's more upbeat, and more satisfying, and it also lets you interpret as to what happened. Does the wife hearing their daughter's voice on the tape recorder mean she now believes Cusack saw their deceased daughter, or does it simply mean they are both trapped in the hotel? I like to believe Cusack got out. Either one is possible, though. That's what makes it so great, because it's left to your imagination<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I can't begin to tell you how impressed I was with this movie. It's scary, disturbing, and provocative. If you want an intelligent horror film that is recent, this one is a perfect choice. <br/><br/>8.7/10"
"christopher-underwood","8","0","1","17 August 2013"," 'Director's Cut'
","One of the reasons I've never watched this before is because i thought it was some historical tale, surely, 'Room 1408' would have been a better title? But then I assume the Stephen King short story, upon which this is based, was simply called '1408'. Interestingly, the story originated as a device within King's autobiographical work, 'On Writing' to help explain story construction and as this film proceeds one becomes very aware of tragic background details of the main protagonist (and maybe King, himself). John Cusack does a very good job here, virtually carrying the bulk of the film himself. In some ways it is a shame because Samuel L Jackson is on such fine form that some extra scenes with him, possibly detailing some back story, might have been welcome. Even so this works surprisingly well and considering most of the film is set within a hotel room, the interest and suspense and intrigue are very well maintained. As well as discovering the origins of the film, after watching it, I also discovered afterwards that I had watched the 'Director's Cut' and that this is substantially different from the theatrical release both in length and in the ending. Now guess which one had the happy ending?"

HAS ANYONE WITHIN FIVE MILES OF THIS SCRIPT READ KAFKA?<br/><br/>okay, i'm sorry, was trying to keep from commenting and force immersion for the last half hour but did they honestly cast that black man from the shining at this point in the film? that's spitting in so many faces, the least of which is mine. i can't even. please, please, don't ever waste your time watching this. hold while i finish so you don't have to.<br/><br/>i'm sorry, but to reiterate, there's one rule in psychological horror: never break immersion. you can break reality as many times as you please, but you NEVER break immersion. this movie treats you like you're eight, so maybe it's something you should show to your six year old.<br/><br/>i can't even. so done. everyone involved in this movie needs to be shot. how many hours of life have they sucked out of this miserable world? why? i know you almost want to watch it at this point, but, no. don't. it isn't boring, it isn't amusing. it isn't even so bad that it's good. it's just infuriatingly poorly conceived, designed and made, end of story."

","After watching it for the 6th time I had to write a review.<br/><br/>1408 is one of those great popcorn, and comfy couch horror movies. Not enough credit goes to the sound guys for this one. Something about the way they used the volume levels, and effects works really well in this film. Great sound, also ""we've only just begun"" by the carpenters will never sound cheesy again, but more creepy. The theme music is also quite sinister.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie is the fact that you get a very good idea of who Mike Enslin is. Watching him go from cynical sceptic, to firm believer begging for mercy is very entertaining and well done. And of course the dialogue between Gerald Olin, and Mike Enslin set the tone perfectly. The twists also work well even after the 6th time because you begin to imagine how terrible that scenario might be in reality.<br/><br/>Of the two endings i'm a fan of the original theatrical ending because it doesn't leave you feeling terrible. Happy endings are essential in a good horror movie I feel.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a horror movie that will keep you entertained, and leave you feeling chills (theatrical ending only) at the end this is a great choice."

","A writer of paranormal activities asks to spend the night in a famously-haunted hotel room hoping for another quick debunking of a tourist attraction only to find that it may be more dangerous to stay than previously imagined.<br/><br/>Overall, this one was pretty mediocre like most of King's efforts. As always, there's something here that works quite well, which here comes from the concept of transporting the scenario of a haunted house into a single hotel room, and those concepts are impressive and generate some fine suspense. A lot of this comes from the great and truly chilling scenes here including the ghostly hallucinations from the woman appearing to attack him in the window across the walkway or the old-time people crawling out the window of the room, although the majority of this one comes from the room interacting with him. These scenes here are where the film really gets good parts as the several different settings intent on trying to terrify him are just absolutely amazing with the utterly irrational behavior that would occur inside such a situation in real life taking place inside here form utilizing disappearing and reappearing objects throughout the room, unexplained reactions to loud radios, tuning into home videos on the TV or around the several different concepts that it plays around with keeping him there. That does lead into a few rather impressive action scenes along the way with his escape into the heating ducts encounter the body there, the later destruction of the postal office to reveal he's still in the room and the finale where he goes to destroy it once and for all where is a great scene here and makes this one quite enjoyable. These's aren't really enough to hold this one off, though, as it just suffers from an over- abundance of clichés that offer up no real surprises here. These really tend to over-play the fact that there's no real amount of logic presented to any of the scenes here since they're so out-of-the-norm for what is supposed to happened in a hotel room to the constant series of mental tortures that keep occurring start to lose their impact due to the non-letup of the pace. It doesn't really build to anything or top the previous gag as it's more a series of scenes that are potentially creepy but just don't register anything that way as we wait for the next scene. As well, there's another problem as absolutely nothing is told of what's going on, as there's no explanation for why anything happens or even if there's anything in the room that haunts it or curses it, since there's nothing given here at all. The last flaw that really hurts this one is a huge heaping dose of melodrama that is unwanted, unneeded and just plain irritating to suffer through, and dragging these out far longer than they should which stand out far more than it's good points.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Violence and Language"

","What a disappointment. What starts as an interesting premise just slides into silly episodes of ridiculous imagery, hallucinations and mumbo jumbo that becomes tedious. John Cusack is always interesting to see on screen and there is a trust that you invest in him as an actor. but sadly here his character is abrasive and selfish and sadly argumentative. Cynical. As a result as he bounces off walls (that drip jam/jelly/blood/yawn) you end up not giving two hoots how he is coping. I actually think 1408 is an allegory for DETOX.

"karllacey1","9","0","1","23 February 2012"," Very solid horror film
","First of all, growing up with John Cusack - I have been one of his skeptics right from the outset with his romcom/teen flicks that spurted out in the 80s and 90s. I watched a film of his which was recommended from a friend a couple of years ago because he said it was great. It wasn't and only compounded my dislike for movies which he appears in.<br/><br/>Herein lies the dilemma, I am a big Stephen King fan - but I don't like John Cusack - so I have put this film off for a few years.<br/><br/>the first point is that it is not about the year 1408 which is what I assumed from the cover of the item, it is about room 1408 a hotel room number.<br/><br/>Firstly, to put the ghosts to bed above. John Cusack's performance was nothing short of outstanding. He was believable, you sympathised with his situation and the range of emotions you went with him was absolutely spot on. Well done Mr Cusack! you have restored my faith in you! Samuel L Jackson's ""Jool's"" performance has been identical in whatever role he has played in. But with his one dimensional acting, it is always pretty decent, he does a job.<br/><br/>So onto the movie, storyline - solid, twists and turns - solid, entertainment value - solid, acting - solid. Scare factor: pretty damn high!!!! I have watched many Stephen King movies (Shawshank being the best) and read many of his books also (IT being the best). As a horror movie, this ranks right up there with Misery and given the fact that the level of horror movies out there that can possibly scare you is very low (Paranormal Activity, The Grudge 1 & 2 - (Japanese), Let the Right One in (Swedish) - do not skip this movie!!!

","The matter of a closed haunted room is fabulous. It's a new shape for a horror, and with one place, one character; it's another (Die Hard) yet against supernatural unseen powers, plus it's a film of a movie as well; where room 1408 equals a moment in which the person meets nobody but himself, facing his conscience's ghosts in inescapable trial. But.. did our dear movie realize any of that? Well, that's the problem. While having unusual potential, it - stupidly - chose to be usual. Let's see the shamefully easy way to achieve everything.<br/><br/>(John Cusack) as a lead? BOO. BOOO. BOOOO! This guy is not that talented, let alone being uncharismatic to the MAX. So baring watching him, for all the time, without seeing someone else, was impossible. A more expensive star, not greater actor, like (Bruce Willis) could have been less provoking, since at least he has a charisma. But (Cusack) was fitter because he demands low fee. Knowing that we're in a horror, nothing was more horrific than Cusack's performance at the moment of ""BUT I WAS OUT, I WAS OUT, I WAS OUTTTTTT"". Mr. (Cusack), I hoped you were out.. of the movie!<br/><br/>No doubt that the rich idea met a poor dealing. The script uses many empty circles for just filling the time with ""some frightening anything""; recorded phone calls, timer radio runs suddenly, ghosts walk in one specific way, etc. It has counted freaky gags as the same as what any silly Tom Arnold movie has, yet purely!<br/><br/>The theatrical end is terrible, I don't know who's the fool who put it there. So the daughter's voice was real; what can I, or anyone in the world, gain out of that?!! And remember, this totally meaningless moment was for ending happily with (John Cusack) alive, JOHN CUSACK ALIVE!!!!!! Kill the bore for god's sake, and for the horror's sake as well! Later, I watched the alternative ending; it's so wonderfully dark, hence more suitable. Obviously this time, with tame everything, choosing tame ending was devastating!<br/><br/>Some points were correctly realized though; the sound effects; being the real lead of this movie, brilliant few moments like meeting the father or having a fax of the daughter's dress, and part of the music. And No, don't wait for me to say (Samuel L. Jackson). He didn't do it coolingly as he could have!<br/><br/>1408 = disappointing whether as a horror, different Die Hard version, or serious film about meeting the ugliness of oneself. It's where being mediocre means weak compared to its potential. Here's a movie that could have been a stroke of genius, but ended up as a strike of genius. Uncreative and cheap are the right words to diagnose why.<br/><br/>P.S: meeting (Samuel L. Jackson) in the refrigerator was laughable in the wrong place. Tells you how the makers of this movie don't know a lot about the basics of horror."
"chaos-rampant","Null","0","1","22 February 2011"," Haunted rooms, haunted minds
","The hotel room fascinates me. When I happen to sleep in one, but especially the cinematic depiction. It's something about the air of ritual anonymity, the numbered keys exchanging hands and the nameless figures disappearing behind numbered doors, the close proximity to a system of lives played out for a few hours or days with a tacit understanding that the private and the public can be allowed to mingle gracefully, under a façade of respectability. Naturally I'm drawn to the perversion of that façade, to the strangeness I find inherent in it. But it's also the thunderous quiet of the empty hotel corridor with the thick carpet that muffles the footsteps. This explains a lot of my love for The Shining, it's an aesthetic affair for the camera that discovers around corners or behind doors, and also my affinity for what 1408 is trying to establish as a world, or borrow from the Kubrick film.<br/><br/>What is troubling for me here, is that the film touches on something I find important, cheapens it by an explicit mention, but is none the wiser in the end. I'm hooked by the idea that we're pretending to talk about a haunted hotel room when we're really talking about a haunted mind long before Mike's wife sits across a dinner table to tell him (and us, in case we didn't pick it up) that his experience with room 1408 was probably an experience with the subconscious. The movie deems the point important enough to explicitly mention it, we should all know, so what comes of it? In Barton Fink, a quizzical John Turturro was fighting in the hot damp Los Angeles afternoon to glue back the peeling wallpapers of his mind as he anguished for the truth of inspiration. Whatever allegory exists in the Coen film, is coming from a point of view that the mind matters, that it can master form or at least bring us close to that primordial stretch of sand washed by the cosmic waves. The sight of the woman in the bathing suit from the picture is a curious sight of relief, a kind of peace afforded by the memory of her picture.<br/><br/>In 1408, we see the process of that anguish, the way by which the mind is deranged. Mike's annoyance begins when he reacts within the walls of his subconscious, to a phone ringing, to an alarm clock. Bewilderment turns into terror, and the ensuing nightmare where he wrestles with inner demons, fear or remorse, where he relives the torments of the past, reveals the limitations of the mind, how it's not the keyhole from which we spy on human misery but the progenitor of it, that a way out is not assured if we dig deep enough.<br/><br/>Perhaps by fashioning a metaphor broad enough, 1408 has stumbled upon a fundamental tenet of Buddhist truth. We are responsible for our bad kharma, and more, we further it by reacting to it. Kubrick didn't give us this in his film for Jack Torrance, as a classicist he values thought and eschews the spiritual, but through a writing happenstance I find here a more lucid picture.<br/><br/>Two instances particularly fascinate me in this representation of the reality of the mind.<br/><br/>One is when Mike discovers his doppelganger in the building across the street and plays a game of tao, who is the mirror, who is the mirrored. The second, when the workers in the post office begin to tear down the post office to reveal the walls of the dreary hotel room now sagging with rot. This apparent reality that we walk in exists within the mind.<br/><br/>But if the apparent reality is a shell, what is the actual reality, what do we come back to? I try to love films despite themselves, but to an extent. Here the extent is the ending, where Mike and his wife listen to the voice of their lost daughter in that tape.<br/><br/>It all becomes irrelevant for me because apparently the movie deems more important the triviality of a horror plot that concludes with a twist about the afterlife than the honest representation of the present one, the haunted room more than the haunted mind. Mike was plainly exposed to the destructive machinations of the mind but is none the wiser. Eventually he concludes that ""some bad memories we don't throw away"" and we're back where we started, to repeat the cycle of misery."

","Stephen King once said ""We make up horrors to help us cope with the real ones."" I would say that Mikael Håfström's adaptation of ""1408"" shows that statement in its entirety. John Cusack plays Mike Enslin, an author who goes to supposedly haunted hotels to debunk the ghost stories. One day, he gets a postcard from a New York hotel warning about room 1408. So, Mike decides to stay there. The hotel owner (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to talk him out of it, but Mike is determined. So begins an experience such as Mike had never imagined...and in the process, the audience learns more about Mike's own history.<br/><br/>Much like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Dolores Claiborne"" focused on personal horror, so does ""1408"", although it certainly adds elements of spooky horror. The movie is less about scaring us than about forcing us to confront the unpleasant episodes in our lives. The point is, a person can't run away from reality.

","I am not one to sit around watching horror films. I am one to sit around watching super- hero flicks and sci-fi's and comedies- genres I consider not even remotely close to horror. I am the type who can't even read the description of a horror film on Wikipedia without feeling slightly terrified. Quite to the contrary, I absolutely love Stephen King. And so when I stumble upon 1408 I instantly wanted to watch it, despite the unsettling feeling that I was going to be freaked out by this. After bracing myself through gory trailers, I anxiously pressed play on the computer... and I was instantly ported into the first movie I've seen in a while that honestly makes you think.<br/><br/>1408, while it does on occasion have undead... zombies? Well, undead ghosts jump out at Mike Enslin (John Cusack), most of the fear you get doesn't derive from slash-and-tear cliché horror. I'm getting the same feelings I got from Inception. I just couldn't help but think of how closely I could relate to Mike Enslin. The emotions Cusack portrays are organic and I honestly invested myself in Mike Enslin and routed for him throughout. (And to clear things right now, I have seen all versions of the film and I'm reviewing the theatrical one, I think. (Not the original version, the other one.)) By the end of the film I was so... seriously shocked by what had unfolded that I was truly speechless. While Mike Enslin might have deserved what he got to some degree I nod my head to John Cusack- he played a believably sad ex- husband/grieving dad. Most actors simply have a generic sad face that you get bored of after 20 minutes.<br/><br/>1408 is not your conventional horror flick. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say I feel like it's more of a mind-bender flick than anything. Challenge what you think you know and SEE THIS FILM!"

","1408 (2007)<br/><br/>5 word summary<br/><br/>Writer stays in killer room<br/><br/>1408 is a classic style horror movie. It doesn't just depend on a serial killer like many horror movies of the last few decades. It has more of a Gothic old school feel to it which makes it stand out from others. <br/><br/>This is one of my favorite Stephen King horror adaptations, second to Kubrick's The Shinning. With a story that barely depends on actual dialog, except for the set up, Director Mikael Hafstrom and the rest of the crew did a great job building suspense. Using music and camera work they get every little thing that happens to be tense. <br/><br/>John Cusack deserves a lot of credit for the thrills as well. Though not his best work, he did a great job at making the film creepy and did have an overall good performance, which doesn't happen much in horror films. Samuel Jackson's role was also really good and was a lot of fun to watch. <br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, one of my favorite parts of this film is that it isn't an average horror movie. The bad guy isn't a killer or anything, it's the mind. Though room 1408 is a ""haunted room"" its not a regular ghost story, it doesn't attack him, it makes him attack himself. Its similar to The Shinning but a different version. Instead of having a hotel room make you go insane and try killing people, the room makes you go insane and kill yourself. <br/><br/>****Spoilers****<br/><br/>My favorite thing about this film is when he wakes up at the beach its all been a dream after he got knocked out while surfing. And really you hate them for it. What a cop out. I actually kind of wanted to walk out. <br/><br/>As his life goes on and thing start showing up from the hotel, faces and people he saw there. You start to wonder what is gonna happen, how can this film save itself. Then the mail room falls apart and he's been in the room the whole time and is still stuck. As a viewer I couldn't help but smile, but for him it makes it worse. What a great save.<br/><br/>As the rest of the film goes on and the end comes you still kind of feel it wasn't real. To him it was real but really he was just crazy. That's why the ending is so great. He plays the recorder and you here his daughter, his wife looks terrified and shocked, he doesn't look surprised at all, he knew it was real, he looks at her with a blank expression. Credits role. <br/><br/>****End Spoilers****<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite horror films. Even if you don't really like horror films you should still like this one. I don't usually enjoy that many horror films but this is an exception. Any horror, King, Cusack or Jackson fans should watch this one and sit back for a fun, creepy, and original horror thriller. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Its been sometime since one of King's works have made it to the big screen, since most of his works go straight to video or television with the likes of IT and The Stand. With 1408, King brings us a serious but enjoyable psychological horror that mixes well with a thriller too.<br/><br/>Performance wise, John Cusack and Samuel L Jackson are on top form and for Jackson it proves he can go for the more deeper smaller screen films in the cinema. Cusack and Jackson work well together here, and show some good moments together.<br/><br/>The eeriness of the film is evident a lot, and we are really messed with psychologically and so you feel like you are getting a good experience.

","Everybody complains when a great novel or short story gets a treatment on film that doesn't do it justice. But what about when a TRULY terrible short story is graced by a talents that makes it almost--ALMOST-- watchable? (Ah, Cusack. I can so much more forgive you for slumming in 2012 than this... And the screenwriters added streaks of poignancy about the life experiences of Mike Enslin that almost bring this into the realm of the existential, but these are nowhere near enough.)<br/><br/>Mr. Olin: During your investigation did you discover the twenty-two natural deaths that have occurred in 1408? Mike Enslin: Natural deaths? Mr. Olin: All told, in the ninety-five years of the hotel's existence there have been fifty-six deaths in Room 1408...<br/><br/>Funny, you'd think any decent investigation of such an abattoir would involve a small army of people to both rigorously record any phenomena and watch each others' backs.<br/><br/>You know, like those ""Ghost Hunters"" style shows. The kind that bore me to tears. As the ""investigators"" describe subjective experiences with no empirical basis, or at best ""encounters"" (""Aaaah! Something scratched my back!"") that, if they were caused by any ""entity,"" would be the result of something so pitifully weak it's laughable. Hey guys, get yourself ""scratched"" by a tiger, a grizzly, a rattlesnake. You won't be lacking empirical evidence of its existence. As Carl Sagan used to say, ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" Funny how many supposedly classic ""supernatural"" writers set up Straw Man scenarios to give characters ""comeuppance"" for intelligent skepticism and intellectual maturity.<br/><br/>S. T. Joshi was right on King. Whatever his *considerable* talents in characterization and accessibility, seen in works adapted to Stand by Me or The Shawshank Redemption, much of King's out-and-out ""supernatural"" horror--the stuff that MADE his career, ironically--is Derek. Not absolutely all of it, there are still a very few classics like ""The Raft,"" ""The Mist,"" (Now there is not only a good story, but a film adaptation gives an ending that improves on the original!) and so on. But to paraphrase the old saying, you can't make chicken salad from chicken excrement."

","With 1408 I was given the opportunity to watch a movie that I had no previous knowledge about. This is usually a rare blessing for me. However, after watching this whole film I now wish I had read a few reviews first.<br/><br/>At first I was intrigued by the basic elements of this film. The plot revolved around a writer who travels about and rates supposedly haunted places. It seemed kind of interesting. However, before I could get too excited about the premise of this film, it caught a bad case of leprosy and began to simply fall apart.<br/><br/>If you ever find yourself forgetting the meaning of ""plot holes"" simply rent this movie and be amazed at how many obvious details can be completely forgotten in the course of 2 hours. How come the question of who sent Mike Enslin (John Cusack) the postcard giving him the idea to go to Room 1408 in the first place never came up? Seriously, it was like watching a version of The Lord of the Rings that didn't explain the story of the one Ring . Sure, we got the idea that Room 1408 was evil, but we were never once explained why. When the movie itself asks questions during some point of the story, for the love of god answer them.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to explain the lack of character exploration in this film. Everybody was a static character. No way would Stephen King write a story that didn't focus on the struggles of the people within it. As I recall, he did not appreciate the recreation of his character Jack in the movie The Shining. I can't imagine he was impressed at all by this awful movie.<br/><br/>3 out of 10, baby.

","I can't think that anyone except the most tirelessly devoted of horror movie fans will find anything of interest in this film. A script so corny you can smell the butter and clichés by the truck load. Add to that some really hammy acting. To be fair, John Cusack does his best  but at the moments of greatest 'horror', his expression seems to be saying that even he can't believe he's been reduced to doing stuff like this. Samuel L. Jackson is just completely wasted: a big bucks name used for no other reason than to sell the thing at the box office.<br/><br/>In ""Danse Macabre"", Stephen King gives the nod to Coleridge's idea of the 'suspension of disbelief', saying that such a thing is made possible in the horror genre (in whatever medium) if the reader or viewer has a complete emotional involvement with the characters. That's what's lacking here. Mike Enslin is such an arrogant, rude, self-important a**hole that you really don't care what happens to him. Even after the rather tame and predictable back-story comes out, you don't feel much different. By three-quarters of the way through, I couldn't care less about him any more and just wanted it to end  preferably in his death.<br/><br/>As a postscript, I watched this on the same evening as 'The Machinist'. This, by complete contrast, is a genuinely creepy examination of a deeply-troubled mind  and not a cliché or cheap trick in sight. Watch this instead if you want to see how it should be done."

","Again, we have another film where the preview was excellent and enticing, but the film itself was rubbish.<br/><br/>It was a Saturday morning, I was feeling the after effects of the night before and decided it was time for a bit of mindless fun and frights.<br/><br/>The opening forty minutes of 1408 was about 35 minutes too long. The final hour of the film was about 40 minutes too long. The end product was pathetic.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this film was supposed to be a scary horror-esq film, but the only really worthwhile moment was when he stepped out onto the window ledge and tried to sidle over to the next room's window. Beyond that, the ghosts and creatures that haunt him are more reminiscent of things you'd see on a ""Ghost Train"" ride at an amusement park. Added to this, the film makers seems to run out of steam and ideas in an attempt to create the worst hotel room imaginable. For instance, the room suddenly became a freezer, nearly killing our hero. Yet there isn't anything particularly scary about an arctic hotel room. This was basically the main problem with the film: it simply was not scary most of time and the ideas seemed almost childish. Many of the attempts to get you to jump out of your seat seem to fail miserably.<br/><br/>The film then attempts to pull some sort of fancy looping, attempting to convince the audience that perhaps it was all a dream. But I'm afraid that I wasn't fooled for a minute.<br/><br/>Above all else, there was something very contrived about the way the room started to play on his personal life. We learn he has a daughter who died and a broken marriage resulted, so it somehow unimaginatively followed that the room would start playing on his person vulnerabilities by bringing up his daughter. There was something so predictable about it.<br/><br/>The ending was rather poor and by then I didn't care anyway. Probably the only positive was the perfectly cast Samuel L Jackson as the host of the haunted hotel. Beyond that, no positives that would make me recommend this film to others."

","Well, 1408 kept at least my attention till the end but I was disappointed about the plot. I watched it on DVD and I chose the original theatric version and not the director'a cut. Okay, John Cusack delivered a very good performance and Mikael Hàfstrom directed flawless. The problem is the story that offers not too much suspense time and it failed on this level. Maybe the writer Stephen King created finally a better book but there were meanwhile much more interesting horror movies filmed from other writers. 1408 hits with this genre no doubt a creepy theme but at the end it went more and more downhill with a poorly executed end. It works more as a psycho than a horror thriller. Don't be afraid, there aren't many bloody or violent scenes to see. Final vote: 5/10 and I'm not interested watching the alternative end that is included in the DVD-Pocket. Watch instead the much more amazing ones such as THE RING, GOTHIKA, SKELETON KEY, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES or the remake THE AMITYVILLE HORROR - read for all my critics."

","1408 (2007) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>John Cusack plays a writer who spends the night in haunted places just so that he can prove that their legends are false. He eventually spends the night at the Dolphin Hotel in room 1408, which is rumored to have caused the death of over fifty people. As I said earlier, the majority of the crowd was jumping out of their seats from start to finish but I guess I've seen too many of these films to be scared by any of them. I was really letdown because the film is so routine in the horror department that if you've seen one ghost film then you should be able to know where all the jump scares are going to come. Why go ahead and give the film three stars? Because Cusack turns in a downright brilliant performance in his nearly one-man act. Cusack goes through all sorts of emotions throughout the film and he nailed them all perfectly creating a true character instead of just a cardboard cutout of someone who has to jump during certain scenes. His scene with Samuel L. Jackson was very well done by both actors but there's a scene at the end with his daughter, which is incredibly sad and really nails the entire film. I thought the third act of the movie and its multiple endings didn't work very well but the final one will leave some hating it but I rather enjoyed its simple nature. Some have compared this to King's other ""haunted"" book/film The Shining but this certainly isn't in its league. The build up and Cusack's performance are the main reason to see this film. If you aren't familiar with ghost stories then this might scare you but if you're a vet like me then just sit back and enjoy the performance."

One of the best horror/psychological films to come out in a longggggggggggggg time. We are bombarded today by hack and slash films with no depth or even good writing. If you like saw, and movies of the like and consider those to be good horror movies, 1408 is NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. I repeat, IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU. People do not get chopped up in this movie, and there is not an abundance of blood or people screaming in agony from being tortured. I personally do not like those kinds of horror movies. They lack serious quality and depth. I don't find someone being chopped up or chainsawed up scary. I can see that anytime I want by turning on the news. Horror films today a lot of times mirror what's happening in our society, so it's hard to be scarred by it. John Cusak was sensational in his role. Absolutely amazing. His range of emotional display in the movie was very impressive and believable. His character sucks you right into the movie. Samuel L. Jacksons role though small but poignant, created a masterpiece of dialog between him and Cusaks character. I could write more but from my rating you can see where I'm going with this. If you like The Shining, and movies along those lines, then you'll love this movie. If psychological thrillers are not your thing and you prefer Saw, Jason, or anyone with a chainsaw or a huge ax, you may want to skip it. As for me, it was a masterpiece."

And in the 104 minutes of the film you can't help but think that maybe we're getting a quick fable pulled out at either end to help fit it onto the cinema screen.<br/><br/>Cusack's character performance moves backwards and forwards from the suitably disdainful Mike Enslin to the terrified and apologetic Mike Enslin, at the instant sight of the ghosts he's been hunting for the past years since the death of his daughter. One would question why, when faced with something he's been looking for, does he turn into a nervous wreck so quickly? Given his profession, an element of fascination would probably have been more suitable, but Cusack's character breaks down mentally as soon as he's faced with his first real test.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson also makes an appearance as the hotel manager, warning Cusack not to enter the room that has claimed 56 lives as he arrives for his overnight stay. Jackson's character is amusing, if a little one dimensional.<br/><br/>But this film is really all about Cusack and the terror. And of course, with any Stephen King story, it's about the twist in the plot. Sad to say those that haven't read the book will most likely still see both twists coming a mile off.<br/><br/>The other things that let the film down is that we don't see the connection between what's happening in the room and its history of deaths. We don't get to understand how/who invited Cusack to the hotel in the first place, other than a weak postcard connection. We get a soft conversation between the room and Cusack that frankly delivers a 'get out of jail' card so big it spoils the horror. And any background about Cusack's disturbed state of mind is shoved in haphazardly to try and explain to us what's going on in his head.<br/><br/>When you look back at Cusack's work, you struggle to see past 2000's 'Hi-Fidelity'. There's been 6 or 7 years of fairly low quality films and had the script-writers on 1408 offered us a better and cleaner insight into the character of Mike Enslin, we might be looking at a Cusack revival..."

I could empathize with him, because I'm also a writer and a skeptic with an interest in horror-related topics and the supernatural. I thought the unusual move of setting this in a major, working New York hotel was well thought-out. I also love the atmosphere of the hotel--the interior decoration, the design of the sets, etc.<br/><br/>All of the above primed me for the film, combined with some fine scriptwriting and performances--for example, the extended scene featuring Jackson's character, Gerald Olin, pleading with and trying every way to bribe Enslin into rethinking his decision to stay in Room 1408 was one of the better I've seen in some time.<br/><br/>The scariest moments arrive fairly early--shortly after Enslin begins his stay in 1408, but the whole film is incredibly engrossing, even if it begins to turn into more of a ""rubber reality"" trip by the end--ala Jacob's Ladder (1990), Memento (2000), The I Inside (2003), and maybe not just coincidentally, the too-little-known Nightmare on the 13th Floor (1990) (different than the Thirteenth Floor from 1999, even though that's another rubber reality film) . . . and that's another favorite genre for me. The ambiguities in 1408 are a lot of fun to speculate about afterwards, but they're also not aggravating, as some rubber reality films can be."

","Very good movie. Its not a horror movie, its more like a thriller with lots of suspense and mystery. Based on the novel of famous writer Stephen King, the story about a writer who after her daughter's death began to investigate haunted places, receives an invitation to stay on room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel and begins to live paranormal experiences in in there its not the most original but it is interesting, it is full of unexpected twists that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole movie. The cast is excellent, John Cusack's performance is awesome, you can really feel his desperation ans Samuel L. Jackson as the hotel manager is also amazing and convincing. In conclusion, this is a movie worth to see."
"The_Orenda","4","0","1","28 October 2007"," A conflict for the ages: man vs hotel room
","Before I say anything about the film, I have to compliment the performance of John Cusack here. From that little crony in Sixteen Candles, Cusack's come a long way in mastering an expressive, manic persona that fits the bill perfectly for 1408. As for the movie itself, 1408 is a stylish thriller that's strong in delivery but weak in substance. Sure the room is evil and plays mind games, but its boogie tactics evolve from the clever to the outright ludicrous. How you could taunt a man with Karen Carpenter's voice in one scene and later have him flee from a corpse in an air duct in another is beyond me but there you see it.<br/><br/>Novelist Mike Enslin stays overnight in hotels and inns and writes of their horror stories. When he receives a postcard to not check into a room in New York, his further investigation shows it's too good of an offer to pass up.<br/><br/>As with other King movies, pay attention to the little scenes at the beginning that may seem pointless but later add up. The room plays all sorts of games from physical to downright emotional and there's no greater tool that it uses to me than its clock. But eventually it uses the phone, the window, the walls and even the fire escape route map to break Michael Enslin even further down. But there is still no funnier scene than Cusack being chased down by a zombie or something in an air duct. What were they thinking? Anyhow, the movie is still an OK psychological thriller once you suspend your disbelief in knowing the antagonist is an evil hotel room. Jackson and Cusack can't get much better in their skills as they themselves convince you that something is terribly wrong in room 1408."

","The set up for the movie is great. Samuel L Jackson plays a Hotel manager for the Dolphin, and he is the one that sets it up perfectly. Yes we have the main actor John Cussack, playing a not so famous writer, that writes about Ghosts, or in his reality the fact he believes their is no such a thing as Ghosts,by the fact he has gone to many hotel's that claim paranormal activity, and had has yet to encounter such an experience, he is basically skeptical and humorous about it with witty lines. So when Cussack decides he wants to check out 1408 a room in the Dolphin Hotel, the room at first is off limits, but Cussack and his lawyers find a loophole to get in. Here is the part that shone so well, Samuel Jackson try's every trick in the book to get Cussack not to go in the room, not for the sake of Cussack, for the sake of not cleaning out the mess, he goes about telling him the history, very convincing and sets up what could or might happen perfectly, this is key part, of the movie to the transition to main event, to Cussack experience in 1408.<br/><br/>OK, am not going to start spoiling the movie. But Samuel Jackson sets up very well. This movie actually creep me out, for a couple seconds, that hardly ever happens. had the type of ending I like. I recommend this movie, to people that like a good scare, or a good story. It might be confusing here and there, for some, but is part of the intricacy and what makes this movie interesting in the first place."

","It's genuinely scary and pretty faithful to the story, for most of it, until the numerous twists and false endings bog it down. Cusack is pretty good, as he manages to be a likable leading man while also portraying his character's quick descent into madness, but Sam Jackson is wasted (unfortunately!), save for his one great line. The direction is impressive and adds to the terror, and the effects are solid without being too flashy. But the last half hour or so adds too many twists on top of one another, and the result is far from effective. It veers too far from the source material, and the ending is confusing in the worst way. Still, it's a fairly decent King adaptation, and I did find it scary."

","A tall, non-descript, centrally based New York hotel named ""Dolphin"" is not exactly the setting where you would expect an other worldly experience but this is exactly the place it all happens and specifically in room 1408. Just as the name of the hotel, and the title which, other than being the number of the room in question, seems to be chosen randomly, the movie fails to deliver a good plot that would keep viewers at the edge of their seats for what seems like a very very long time.<br/><br/>The acting is not up to scratch despite the big names, and the story is just not that convincing  one criteria that is absolutely crucial if we are meant to be scared. As we follow what appears at first to be a jaded, been there done that got the t-shirt small time writer on his quest to find a truly haunted hotel, just to be reassured over and over again that no such thing as ghosts exist, we see him loose his cool demeanour as the radio turns itself on in this ""haunted"" room 1408. This is followed by a few more ""scary"" happenings where the window closes itself when he bumps his head on it, or the loo roll seems to have folded itself into place , and our ghost buster is peeing his pants (not literarly) and is ready to leave the room. Thankfully, or not, he does not leave and we are rewarded for our patience with a fairly good show of some poltergeist activity for the next hour or so.<br/><br/>There is a nice twist in the movie, just when we thought it was safe, and we get a good scare near the very end, but there is nothing there that would disturb your good night sleep after watching it.

","1408 is a movie which is refreshing and full of clichés at the same time. In fact, if the main idea is somewhat new (at least I don't remember to watch too many movies about haunted hotel rooms!) the way the plot develops and the kind of suspense used is everything but a novelty! The plot is a bit confusing, but it's not even a big deal, since I use to like puzzling stories; the main problem is that it's too confusing in the middle, being even senseless at parts, just to have an incredibly common/average ending! Why create those ""pseudo""-twists in the plot? Were they to create suspense? If so, I think they totally failed! <br/><br/>On the other hand, I think the visual effects are pretty good (but only if we exclude those shallow-ghosts, which seemed to come out from a comic book!). The acting was also fine, especially if we consider it's almost a ""one man's movie"", since the role of John Cusack is a great part of it! <br/><br/>Globally, I don't think the film is bad, but it's nothing special either"
"classicsoncall","8","0","1","7 October 2007"," ""Stay scared.""
","If you've seen enough horror films, it's pretty hard to come away totally surprised by events in a picture that are meant to be scary. Still, ""1408"" does a pretty good job with setting up the viewer and it's principal player, John Cusack, for a roller coaster ride of conflicting emotions. I thought the selection of The Carpenters' tune was pretty interesting, as it conveyed to Mike Enslin (Cusack) that yes indeedy, we're just getting warmed up here and you better buckle yourself in for the ride. I thought though, that Cusack's character started to lose it just a little too early in the picture when the coincidence angle could have been played up a bit more. But by the time things really get rolling, the story builds with more and more authenticity so that you start putting yourself in Cusack's shoes and start wondering what you'd do if you were stuck in Room 1408 yourself. Me, I'd rather not even think about it, because if you've ever read one of Stephen King's books alone at night in the dark, on purpose, then that's as much of a scare as I'd like to attempt. Try watching this one alone at night, in the dark, on purpose."

","The only word that comes to mind to describe this film is a mess.<br/><br/>Generally, I love John Cusack in just about everything he's done... But in my opinion, this was his worst acting job ever... And maybe it wasn't all his fault since the film itself was all over the place. I don't know how close this film followed King's short story, but it's as though the story tellers would have one idea, begin to follow it, then suddenly yell out, ""Hey, let's take this story in this strange direction by having John's character waving at himself through the window."" Nothing that happened would follow through with itself, if that's the best way to put it, and the film was not scary in the least. The only remotely scary part of the film was Samuel L. Jackson's scene in his office persuading Cusack not to stay in the room.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to a good scare... but alas, this movie failed."
"miketigas25","7","0","1","29 September 2007"," A really nice horror movie
","Not exactly a ""true masterpiece"" but still awesome in all respects. It didn't rely much on ""make-up ghosts"" and CGI monsters (Uh-oh. Boogeyman comes into mind). It's the kind of movie that makes you want to think about putting yourself into the main character's situation and wondering what you could or would have done. It's a psychological/horror thriller. And the horror part isn't poorly written nor incompetently exaggerated (to the point that it makes you laugh). Both elements just blends together perfectly. Nice work on the part of the writer.<br/><br/>So what else could mess a good movie like this? The actors. I wouldn't say John Cusack is a bad actor. But some scenes with John was just... funny. Just when the movie was picking up pace, suddenly there's this scene that ruins it all. And John's facial expressions during THAT scene made me smile and lose the ""built"" fear that the first minutes of the film have created. I don't know. Maybe it's just me. Or maybe it's the fact that John Cusack got a little... fatter than the last time I saw him.<br/><br/>As usual, Samuel Jackson is great. At first I was disappointed at how ""limited"" his role was but after the movie I began to realize that his role was just right. The movie needed someone to kick-start the first parts of the movie. And someone as good as Samuel was just right for the part. But apparently, whenever I see Mr. Jackson, there's only one thing I could think of: ""SNAKES ON A PLANE!!! NOOOOO!!!"" Seriously, snakes on a plane? Why Mr. Jackson?! Why?! All in all, a pretty good movie with a lot of scares that doesn't rely on cheap startles. Probably the scariest thing about the movie is that it makes you expect something to happen in the next few seconds (i.e. John switching the lights on) then nothing happens and just when you are about to settle down - BOOM - the movie gets you.

","Well we all have seen it in the music industry, with the lack of truly original talent and craftsmanship produced. And I mean 1408 contains all the commercial tricks of how to sell bland garbage to the masses. It seems all to apparent that this film makes use of every type of trick in the book, stolen rite from some classic films made previous. Obviously the makers of this film didn't intend it to be viewed by mature film fans and I also can understand why its gone down well with a younger audience whom are ignorant to the art of films from which so much of this films content was stolen to make cold hard cash.<br/><br/>The film sets out rather promising with some mediocre filming that gives the film an edge of unease. You actually develop quite a strong relationship with the broken character and look forward to watching him plunder into the depths of hell. And with the quite a good performance but a simple part that Jackson plays your kind of expecting something hideous.<br/><br/>From then on your drawn into a kind of cocktail of surreal happenings that seem just plain wrong. The special effects just don't work at all like a badly doctored photograph and add to a confusion. The film takes you into a kind of Twilight Zone stroke The Shining with cinematography techniques to compliment but again are used from many types of movies before it.<br/><br/>Towards the end your even tormented by a harrowing sadness that could send some watchers into a raw depression. <br/><br/>So as you can tell after watching this film I was not at all impressed but I do actually like watching bad films because like anything when you get to point that you can look down at a film it say's you have seen some better ones.<br/><br/>My Ratings are Entertainment value 3, Mainstream entertainment value 7, Cinematography 6, Originality 2, Special effects 4, Acting 6, Watch again level 3, Cult level 4, and an overall 4.5 <br/><br/>Conclusion is it will be favourable to the new age of movie goers but lacks any substance to give it anything more.

Mike is a writer and after the tragic death of his daughter he leaves writing novels behind and creates his own, albeit, rather unsuccessful ""10 Ten Most Haunted"" franchise.<br/><br/>The movie starts of with Mike travelling to a haunted hotel to investigate whether or not it is actually haunted, but in no way does Mike actually believe in ghosts or actual hauntings.<br/><br/>After a good 20mins Mike receives an anonymous postcard informing him about a mysterious and dangerous room at the Dolphin Hotel. Mike sets of to the hotel only to be informed by manager Samuel L Jackson, who is not playing a cop or bad ass mutha, that room 1408 is haunted and that many of his clients have died unnatural deaths and .shock horror .even natural deaths in that particular room.<br/><br/>So off Mike goes to room 1408. Here it is were John Cusacks performance really shines. You have to bear in mind that four the next hour it is basically Mike alone reacting with the goings on.<br/><br/>Instead of running around shrieking in a pair of hot pants as is the norm in modern horror movies, Mike tries to logically explain what is going on and how the staff of the Dolphin Hotel are trying to put the frighteners on him.<br/><br/>Just when you think that the movie is all sewn up in a totally predictable way and we can go home for the night the twist comes, and I don't want to spoil anything in great detail but what I can say is that it is one of the biggest disappointments in movie history. The twist served no real purpose but to extend the movie for another thirty minutes and supply the audience with another inferior ending to wrap the movie up.<br/><br/>There was no conclusion or explanation as to why the room was evil but I do know that if it was all sewn up there would be no need for a much inferior sequel staring a lesser known actor.<br/><br/>There is no doubting that there were some jumpy moments throughout the movie, but someone quietly sneaking up behind you isn't really that scary.<br/><br/>The movie was saved by John Cusack who went from a sarcastic unbeliever to a terrified wreak. Samuel L Jackson showed up to give us some background information and as it is probably written into all his contracts he provides the movies only ""F"" word.<br/><br/>The 1408 also wins an award for the most pointless CGI scene ever - who ever thought that the audience would need to see a special effect of someone turning a key in a door is very deluded.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the 1408 is an OK movie and I would give it 7/10.<br/><br/>It loses a point for Samuel L Jacksons use of the ""F"" word, it was predictable and as much as I love Samuel L Jackson, he just wasn't believable as a hotel manager. It loses two points for the twist and the ending. I would rather they just ended it at the twist as the actual ending was just as predictable and to be honest boring.<br/><br/>John Cusack did save the movie and it would be worth seeing it just for him - and this comes from someone who wouldn't call herself a huge Cusack fan.<br/><br/>I would say to you - go and see the movie - it is entertaining but you will come of the cinema thinking that it could have ended so much better."

Mike continues around 1408 looking for tell tale signs of foul play uttering to himself his sarcastic theories to explain the earlier events, fortunately this is short lived as the horror kicks in. 1408's history is very cleverly portrayed by a case file provided by the manager detailing some of the rooms disturbed inhabitants and also some extremely good special effects. Sadly the special effects are also what made this movie a bit of a stinker for me, I was left wondering if Stephen King had written this around the release of Time Bandits or The Twilight Zone using the same effects team or at least some unconvincing illusions brought back from the 80's.

","I think even the most ardent fan would have to admit that a lot of films based on the work of Stephen King are somewhat less than brilliant, but with 1408, he's certainly scored a hit this time! The film will obviously always be compared to what is probably the most successful film based on one of his novels - The Shining - due to the hotel setting and supernatural theme of the film, but the two stories really aren't much alike and 1408 can be enjoyed without having to draw comparisons between the two. The film stars John Cusack in his first good role in ages, and he plays Mike Enslin - a writer who makes a living by writing about haunted places, and also a man broken by the loss of his daughter. One day, while looking for places to visit, he receives a mysterious postcard from the Dolphin Hotel with a note telling him to stay out of room 1408. Naturally, he decides that he wants to stay in that room, but the hotel manager is not at all keen on the idea and does his best to change Mike's mind. But he's having none of it, and after an argument, he gets the keys to 1408...<br/><br/>The build up to the inevitable stay in the room is fantastic, and the film features an absolutely great scene between the stars John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson. The room itself is a masterpiece of supernatural horror and director Mikael Håfström piles on the scares once the action reaches the title location. It has to be said that the film does have a few problems - the plot doesn't always flow well and certain parts of it feel unneeded (probably as a result of the fact that this is a feature length film based on a short story), but most viewers are unlikely to care about this once the film gets to room 1408, as from there on out 1408 is a thrill ride from start to finish. The atmosphere is superb and the way that the horror builds up slowly is extremely unsettling and expertly puts the viewer in Mike Enslin's precarious situation. Cusack is just great in the central role and delivers an excellent varied performance. The film also features a great twist on the classic clichéd ending that really does the story justice. Overall, this is certainly one of the best horror films in years and one of the best based on King's work - highly recommended!"
"WarriorAlien","9","0","1","24 August 2007"," What lies in the the silence of the next few moments? 1408 lets us anticipate.
","Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a jaded man, probably because he's dedicated a good portion of the past few years searching for any sign of life beyond the mortal coil. He travels across the country, spending single nights in the time at every possible haunted site in America, looking for signs of the paranormal and finding nothing. At his latest book signing, the worn-out writing admits that his lack of contact with ghosts and ghouls he's long hoped for has invoked skepticism in him.<br/><br/>Yet he is summoned to the Dolphin Hotel in New York City in a manner reminiscent of Pandora's Box: a postcard is sent to him from the hotel, warning him not to enter a certain room 1408. Of course, this is implied as much more an invitation than anything else. His curiosity piqued, Mike Enslin makes his way to NYC to find out just what is going on with room #1408.<br/><br/>The past decade has seen many horror films categorised into either ""exploitive,"" ""contrived"" or ""unoriginal,"" the latter category defined by the veritable slew of remakes that has dominated the horror movie industry. As of 2007, I have seen only three such remakes that would qualify as great movies in my eyes: Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (2004), Marcus Nispel's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and Jonathan Liebesman's prequel, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (2006). 1408 is not a remake or prequel by any means, but an adaptation of one of Stephen King's short stories. Another novella of his, ""Secret Window, Secret Garden,"" provided the basis for the excellent Johnny Depp thriller Secret Window in 2004 and proved that the horror genre can survive without gratuitous blood and gore, and with immersive characters as well.<br/><br/>1408 follows suit, invoking a style of horror much more comparable to Stanley Kubrick's semi-adaptation of King's The Shining (1980) than anything like Saw. We learn from hotel manager Gerald Olin (played snarkily by Samuel L. Jackson) that there has been a total of 56 deaths, natural and unnatural, in room #1408, the building's only haunted site. Against Olin's wishes (and with the man's brandy in hand), Mike Enslin decides to spend the night, expecting more of the same that he's encountered along the way.<br/><br/>What starts off with simple drafts of wind and mysterious mints manifesting on pillows between shots becomes a literal house of horror for Enslin as window's shut without warning, his key breaks off in the lock, and The Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun"" blasts on the clock radio, signifying that Mike has only 60 minutes left to live in 1408.<br/><br/>The remaining portion of the movie is a wonderful combination of suspense, visual horror, and an insight into what drives Mike Enslin to do his (until now) unrewarding work. This film makes some of the greatest use of silence in a film since Ridley Scott's Alien, and more than ten seconds without music on the soundtrack would leave me thinking that something was about to pop up. When the sound is going, the surround sound system makes the most of its potential. Most notably, we learn about Enslin, his estranged wife, and the daughter they lost to terminal disease, and how her early death lead him to search for her in some way.<br/><br/>While the suspense in 1408 certainly stands out, it is totally and completely a story about human loss and letting go of your loved ones. Mike Enslin's struggle with his daughter's death is just as, if not more fascinating than the horrible room he spends the vast majority of the movie trapped in. You feel for him, and desperately want him to come to terms with the issues in his life and escape.<br/><br/>One of the best movies of 2007, by far, and I wait for it eagerly to hit shelves on DVD. Mr. King should be proud his short work has turned into something so well made."

This is important as the rest of the film is spent by himself in a hotel room. To be honest that did put me off before I watched it but don't be fooled.

","That was really frightening. Movie doesn't have full of blood scenes, there are no monsters, no paranoiac insane maniacs; but it *is* scary. An egoistic writer Mike Enslin gets royalties from sellings of cheap books about paranormal hotels and rooms. One day he got a card about mysterious room 1408 in the ""Dolphin Hotel"". This room is never leased or booked because nobody ever returned from it alive, nobody even stayed alive for more than hour. These facts only strengthen Mike's desire, and he stayed in it in spite of all warning of hotel's manager. Very soon Mike realized that it was his mistake. I haven't noticed any philosophical ideas or thoughts to think about. May be there shouldn't be those, such films are intended for another, just for emotional experience and a bit fear. If so, this movie definitely is a good horror movie. One can say that sometimes it is stupid and abnormal. And that's right - several episodes are that sort of. Well, if there were a multitude of movies such as ""Psycho"" or ""Jaws"", I would say that ""1408"" is sucks. But in contrast to many-many other ""horrors"", it looks very exciting and thrilling. I guess that's the main point of the film and that's what many fans of horrors like. My recommendation: it's one of the best horrors of late years, just go and see it."

If you've watched both movies, you know what I mean. Other than that, it wasn't scary in the least except for that weird slasher guy you see a couple times is mildly startling.

","Many devoted horror fans may have noticed the lack of truly horrifying movies within the last fews years or so. Violence and gore have become the current standards of the Horror/Thriller genre. But this adaption of Stephen King's short story 1408, may be heralded a savior.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Mike Enslin(John Cusack), a man who looks to find evidence of real ghosts/hauntings. He stumbles upon the Dolphin Hotel in New York, that contains a haunted room, which is obviously 1408. But thats all I can say for the story, you yourself have to sit down and enjoy the rest of the ride.<br/><br/>First off I must say the focus point of the film, Cusack, performs very well. I haven't seen much of his other work, but watching this made me more interested in doing so. He effectively portrays a man who feels alone and terrified, writhing in a pool of psychological torment based on his past one moment and the room's own brand of terror the next. He keeps your grip on him and without all the unnecessary bloodshed, makes you feel connected with his character's ordeals.<br/><br/>Samuel Jackson also has a smaller role in the movie, but is nonetheless a benefit to the quality of the movie itself.<br/><br/>See it if you actually want to feel horror only Stephen King's mind can provide."

","1408 started off OK, but once the interaction of John Cusack and Samuel L. Jackson was over the story became predictable. The cat and mouse of the two characters was engaging and well worth the $8.75 for the ticket, but there just was not a whole lot to the movie. The acting by Cusack was competent and his predicament understandable as a writer of haunted hotel reviews, but there were no real surprises. Samuel L. Jackson rarely gives a sub-par performance these days, but his presence in the film as the manager of the hotel in question could have been so much more. The ghosties and ghoulies that inhabit the Dolphin Hotel aren't really that scary. The most terrifying part of the movie is the incessant Carpenter's music that comes from the bedside radio alarm clock. To categorize this film as a thriller or suspense or horror is to mislead the potential viewer. In fact, there are quite a few comedic moments in the film that had the whole audience howling in laughter. All in all a good film but one that doesn't deserve to be added to any-one's DVD collection."

Too bad the man didn't really have any function though. This movie wasn't as big on explaining as it was on showing. Yeah, some skeptical author on supernatural phenomena who ironically doesn't believe in the paranormal spends a night in some haunted hotel room...and that's the plot. What the hell? What was the function of Jackson's character besides providing gory background about 1408? How could the dream sequence happen if Cusack actually never left the room? How come a hotel employee mutilated herself seconds after being in left in its bathroom but Cusack could spend five minutes in there unharmed? Maybe it's because he's Cusack, and the ghosties decided to give him a chance because they really liked his performance in Better Off Dead. Entertaining, but leaves questions unresolved."

","When I heard Stephen King's short story 1408 from Everything's Eventual was being turned into a full length movie, I had doubts. Most of Stephen's work can't be transfered onto the big screen correctly. Sure, it wasn't exactly like the book, but it was still great. John Cusack's acting was right on the mark. He gave a strong performance which helped the movie flow. Although Samuel Jackson didn't have a lot of screen time, he did a great job as the manager of the Dolphin Hotel. The plot is very fresh and creative. There aren't just a bunch of ghost, the room itself plays a role in making the guest go mad. The plot even gets to see John's character's background unravel as he loses his mind. Most horror films these days are very clichéd and boring, this one isn't. There are many twist that will catch you by surprise like they did to me. At one point you'll drop your jaw thinking the film makers pulled an easy one on you, but you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised by the true outcome of this film.

","Good horrors are like good women (or men depending, on your point of view). They are damn hard to find, but I hit pay dirt today with 1408. Its the John Cusack Actors' Workshop, here. He still plays John Cusack, as he always does, but this is a challenging script to perform, not only because of the wide range of extreme emotions required, but also because he is usually acting alone. To make this work, Cusack has to sell us with his performance. Wrap it, bag it and ship it C.O.D., because I bought it. I am a Cusack fan, but this is the most challenging role of his career. There is a strong, suspenseful story that manages to change gears whenever it is in danger of becoming mired down in repeat material. Finish it off with a pretty good ending (always the most challenging part of any screenplay, particularly suspense features) and the result is a tense, clever thriller. <br/><br/>John Cusack is Mike Enslin, a cynical, but determined horror writer who gets wind of a particularly haunted suite at an exclusive NYC hotel. Hotel manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson), does his best to dissuade Enslin from staying in the room with tales of strange occurrences and the countless guests who really did 'check out', but to no avail. Enslin is determined to stay the night and debunk the supernatural reputation of room 1408. Sounds simple enough. <br/><br/>Imagine Castaway crossed with The Shining and you will have some idea of what to expect from this film. Horror fans will like it's shock-and-jump scenes and thriller fans will enjoy the persistent tension. Cusack fans will be glad to see him stretching himself.

","I went to see 1408 this last weekend and was shocked by how good it was. I remember the short story from Stephen King's Everything's Eventual. I've even reread it since seeing the movie. The filmmaker really nailed the details of the story, even the clothes described (hawaiin shirt). Not only that, part of the dialog to the movie (the main character's dialog) was cribbed whole from King's own introduction to the story in the anthology. Not only that, but King himself is heartily endorsing the movie. There's been A lot of bad Stephen King movies (and more than a few bad books), but I read King's articles in Entertainment Weekly and he and I share A lot of the same likes and dislikes. If he dug it, I knew it would be good.<br/><br/>When I took my wife to it, it was with the stipulation that the movie wasn't horror, that it was a slick ghost story with horror elements, but much more along the lines of a thriller. She wasn't thrilled to go and I could foresee what happened at 29 Weeks Later happening again (her curling into a fetal ball and going to a happier place...the crap she has to put up with being married to me).<br/><br/>The movie unfolded. Suffice it to say, it was one of the best, scariest rides I've taken in the movies in recent memory. Forgetting the couple of jump-scares (there's a few), the feeling of utter terror permeates the movie. Every time you think you know where its going, it turns 90 degrees in a completely unsuspected direction. By the time its over, it was amazing.<br/><br/>Now, I understand people are referencing The Shining in their reviews. That's understandable. King wrote both (although I do prefer the Kubrick movie to the piece of crap that was on TV a few years ago) and it does have to do with a haunted hotel. But that's where the similarities end. What I compare this to is much more of Jacob's Ladder, the 1990 Adrian Lyne mindscrew starring Tim Robbins. Both are about the internal effects of trauma, about how the haunted can also be the haunter.<br/><br/>This was a great movie, one which surprised me about 20 times. Still not 100% sure of everything in the movie. There are loose ends, a few little plot gaps, but the acting is top notch (Cusack for Oscar?) and the directing was superb. My hats off to Mikael Håfström. He's a directing talent to watch. He just got added to my 'don't care what the flicks about, he's directing' list. Romero is on that list too (although after Bruiser...)"
"wandererwillow","8","0","1","8 July 2007"," An interesting movie, if you can see the reason for it...
","Many people I know went into the movie thinking ""the room is haunted"" and they had the general air that it would be a horror film. What many seem to miss is that the film was NOT about the room. The movie was based on the character, and his understandings of the room. If you are confused as to what was happening, change the perspective. The room wasn't causing the visions. He was.<br/><br/>All the memories, all the visions, all the things that happened to him were all inside his head. If you take the short time needed to read the story, you see exactly what was being portrayed. Most may go to a movie like this, expecting to be scared out of their minds but not thinking deeply about why things were happening. Yes, there were many changes from the book, but the air of it all remained the same. The man was slowly losing his mind. The room was overtaking him and he was going insane.<br/><br/>If you see the movie, remind yourself at times that you need to think deeper. King's work is very deep and has many levels to it, and sometimes you miss the true meaning when you only look at the surface. The only reason the book and movie are different is because of the style used to write the book, which would have been almost impossible to transfer to film. Yet, I feel they still do an amazing job.<br/><br/>My only complaint (that gave this movie 8 Skulls) was at the end, which seemed to take away that arguable side of whether it was real or not. After a certain scene, a definitive answer is given that kills the wonder of what happened prior. Beyond that, the acting was great, the events were perfectly done, and if you take the time to think deeper on the movie, you will see how truly amazing it is."

","Stars: John Cusack, Mary McDonnell, Samuel L.

One of the main reasons it might have been so fun was having actor John Cusack playing the frightened victim and having Samuel L. Jackson play the hotel manager. When you have two good actors, movies always seem better. The plot for ""1408"" is pretty simple. Mike Enslin (Cusack) is a disheartened author who used to write well liked novels, and now writes about scary places to go. Enslin ends up at the Dolphin Hotel, home of 56 deaths in one room. When he stays in the room, he learns the truth about the room. I thought the movie could've been really scary, instead of just scary (which it was). It all too often scared the audience by putting them into a cool calm, then having a noise, or something loud jump out. I really liked the music, except for towards the end where I thought it was just getting too dramatic and didn't work. Though there were a few things I didn't like, ""1408"" was still a great scary movie that I could easily see again.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 87 mins. PG-13 for language and violence."
"gavin6942","8","0","2","6 July 2007"," One of the Few Truly Good Modern Haunted House Stories
","Michael Enslin is a hack writer who travels the country writing about haunted mansions, hotels and cottages... despite not believing in ghosts, poltergeists or even gods. He will have to face his nihilism in room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in New York, where not only apparent ghosts but also his tormented soul comes to get him in his own little prison of the mind.<br/><br/>This great (and, in my opinion, overlooked) film comes from Mikael Håfström, director of one of 2005's better and more psychologically intense films, ""Derailed"". If you saw ""Derailed"", you know what this man is capable of as far as setting a very dark and gritty tone to his movies. Where that film explored rape, kidnapping and blackmail, here we examine why God allows children to die and how families get torn apart in the process (which, while still sad, is far less messy for the viewer).<br/><br/>Almost all the great horror tricks are employed here (with the notable exception of the cat fake-out). Bleeding walls, screaming children, hammer-wielding psychos, and some new ideas I've never seen before. One scene where Enslin sees a vision across the street is both creepy and memorable. I was worried when I saw this was Stephen King movie and even ore worried knowing it was PG-13, but they pushed the envelope every chance they got. I never had a moment to be let down in the scary department (yes, I jumped a few times -- even this veteran is not immune).<br/><br/>What makes this a more powerful film is that while the superficial story is a man in a haunted room, the real story is his relationship with his wife and daughter. The audience is left being jolted between terror and sadness, not being sure whether to cover their eyes in fright or wipe the tears from their eyes from the family drama. Again, Håfström knows how to draw tension amongst families. And John Cusack, who is consistently a powerful actor, is able to fill the shoes given to him.<br/><br/>If you went to this movie to see Samuel L. Jackson, you went for the wrong reason, as his role is relatively minor (though, not at all strange, he's the character who delivers the PG-13's one f-word). He does well, there's just not that much of him. What started to lose me (and made me think for a while that I'd have to lower my grade on this one) was the film's length. Although the movie is very good, it carries on a bit long and there are many times where it seems like it should end but just keeps going. I fear that while this works alright in theaters, where complete attention is given, this might lose a lot of viewers when the film comes to video. I was never ""fed up"", but I can't deny as much as I loved it I was also fidgety.<br/><br/>When's the last time you saw a good haunted house film? A long time. As much as you might have loved Ryan Reynolds getting naked in ""Amityville Horror"", you'll love Cusack (not getting naked) much more in this one. Scary creatures and psychological madness combine for what is the horror thriller of 2007 so far. Catch it while in theaters, if possible. The surround-sound experience will really drive this one home. Yes sir, I like it."

Everyone in the theater was leaning forward in their seats at the same time, and the calls of ""oh my god"" came from most people present as the entity tortures him in ways that are ever more cruel and disturbing.<br/><br/>I no longer remember the story well enough to know if it follows the book to the letter, but it doesn't have to and you don't care when you watch it.<br/><br/>John Cusack is flawless in his role, and he has to be since the movie is mostly just him alone with The Room.

Horror films have always had the potential to be so much more than the industry or public has let them be. I really believe that 1408's story lends itself to more way subtlety that it is given in this film. Sure its billed as a psychological thriller and definitely deals with some dark subjects. However the overall tone of the film is just not creepy enough for me to be convinced that it is a thriller. Once he entered the room, I more or less just sat in the dark and waited for sh*t to pop out. Where's the creepiness in that? Where's the women in the tub, like in the shining? If this room makes people go mad, why not show some serious hallucinations? Not just a wide angle lens and camera wobble? It seems as if the director wanted this to be a fun film that could appeal to a non-horror crowd. A scary, fun-house kind of entertainment that constantly reminds you that nothing you are looking at could be real. At one point Samuel Jackson tells John Cusack that ""thats a evil f*cking room"". Well? All I can say is, show me! Don't pull punches. Give me evil, not a tales from the crypt episode. My advice is, save your money and rent the DVD"

Over and over, but that didn't stop Mike. There were some funny parts in the film as well. Even when John Cusack was experiencing the strange events. This movie will make you jump and feel all tingly like some movies do. At least I did when I saw it. I've never seen a movie with John Cusack, but this one made a amazing impression. So, trust me you will want to see this. You may not think the same way I do, but you will get a sense of entertainment out of this wonderful film."

","I love Stephen King...adore everything he does and writes. I think he is a downright modern day literary genius and I have loved almost every film based on his works done with the right spin and the right 'King' touch. You can't go wrong because the man is the master of suspense, terror and horror and 1408 is no exception. I credit King as the writer only because screenplay writers Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (all very accomplished writers) did a terrific job of adapting over King's short story and keeping in all the King-ism's that make his stories great. The name of Mike Enslin in itself is a King-ism in some way, the main character is a writer, free to travel and do his thing, separated from his wife, cynical, and then you have the more precise things like the old song suddenly blaring on the radio, turning something mundane into something evil and horrible (ie: The Motel Room) The film just holds it's King style very well and rivets you to the story. Much of that must be accredited to it's lead actor who, like many critics say, performs basically a one-man-show holding 99% of our attention and action and suspense in one room.<br/><br/>John Cusack has always been a personal favorite of mine. Somehow I don't think he's really gotten his BIG breakthrough although he has had some incredible roles and 1408 is definitely one of them. Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a low budget horror writer that investigates haunted locals and writes about them. His cynicism and the tragic loss of his daughter has left him believing nothing about the afterlife or ghosts of any kind. Cusack's gradual character change from the cynic to the man trapped by the very essence he fought to not believe is brilliant and he still holds that feisty cynicism even as everything comes crashing around. He is the action star, the dramatic star, the comedic star, and the horror star all in one film sometimes all at once and that makes his performance absolutely brilliant. Of course there is some support there for him including the amazing Samuel L. Jackson who honestly doesn't get much of a chance to be amazing. He has a very small cameo role as the manager of the hotel who pleads with Cusack not to stay in room '1408.' Jackson gets maybe 15 minutes of screen time but he's still fun to watch. Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony play Cusack's family (daughter and wife) and they share a little bit less screen time than Jackson but they are both very good in the perspective roles.<br/><br/>'1408' doesn't rely on gore or excessive violence and scares but rather works in the sub conscious creating this eerie and sci-fi type situation with every day situations and objects to really make your skin crawl. There is a surprise around every corner and any time you think you know what's going on it's never the answer. The seemingly 'horrible' ending is not the ending at all and keeps you in your seat for the next half hour. 1408 is the perfect suspense movie for a night at the movies. A worthwhile treat that potentially could be serialized. Only Stephen King could make a terrific story about a killer hotel room. 9/10"

","I start off my review with a warning. If you don't like to think about your movies, and review them over in your head trying to construct a conclusion on exactly what you just saw, skip this movie completely.<br/><br/>The movie starts out informing you about what the central character, Mike Enslin (John Cusack), does for a living. While it doesn't give you too much information about Enslin in the beginning, you gradually learn more about him as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>Mike Enslin is a writer who has focused mainly on informational books about haunted houses, lighthouses, forts, etc. As he looks for a hotel to complete his stories in his latest book, he is sent a postcard informing him to ""Do not enter 1408"". Once the reverse psychology sets in, Enslin is on his way to the Dolphin Hotel, where the Manager (Samuel L. Jackson) is bent on forbidding him to enter 1408, where previously many deaths has occurred.<br/><br/>From there on to the end of the movie, John Cusack shows a fantastic one man performance with many twists and turns along the way. This movie shows the true acting power of Cusack as well as the uniquely eerie style of Samuel L. Jackson.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Stephen King's short book ""1408"", you will not be disappointed by this movie. While some drastic changes are made from the book to this movie, they still fit smoothly in with the rest of the original story. ""1408"" seems just as creepy and ingenious as the book.<br/><br/>So all in all, this movie is not for the absent, small, or thoughtless minded. While it is spooky at some parts, and a few things might startle you, the only thing you will want to do after this movie is think, ""Wow."" ""1408"" is the movie for you, if you can enjoy a good conversation afterwards."

","Alright, so I broke down and went to see this movie and I must say I'm amazed. I've always been a big Cusack fan since better off dead but this sealed the deal. His performance was the best yet in this film. He was awesome in gross point blank(if you've not seen it, buy it now!) but this topped the list in my opinion. For those of you that have also done large amounts of acid in the years past, the movie is easy to relate to. I'm not one to watch a movie more than once every few years but this is one I will go back to the movies and see and I will buy it on DVD as soon as its out.<br/><br/>What type of film is it? Easy to point it out. Its the shining in a much nicer wrapping. If you enjoyed the shining i would suggest goig to the theater NOW, or the vido store if this comment lasts that long. I give this movie a perfect ten because Cusack delivered a stunning performance along with a great story line, ongoing suspense, and a very well put together film."

","Mike Enslin played by John Cusack is a man searching for a hope of an after life. The desperation comes from the death of his daughter, which sends him on a endless quest for closure. Along side Cusack, the film credits Samuel L. Jackson as Gerald Olin the foreboding Dolphin Hotel manager and a small bit role by Monk's Tony Shalhoub.<br/><br/>Much to my satisfaction this film actually made me jump a few times. However, the scare factor does not lie in cheap thrills, although I must say that I was put off a few times by one to many scare tactics, but granted a horror film must have necessary evils. The aspect that sets this movie a part from recent attempts a decent horror film is the imagination. Now a days screen writers use reality to their advantage where as Director Mikael Håfström is not afraid to use his imagination.<br/><br/>I don't think this film would have worked had it not been for Cusack. Even though his older age is starting to show, he still has a sinister presence on screen. As much as I wanted to not like this film, Cusack brought me back in every time. I also though Jackson did a fare job with what he was given. Perhaps a little too Samuel L. Jackson and not enough hotel manager, but what can you expect. I thought the daughter Katie played by an up and comer Jasmine Jessica Anthony added an unsettling element that brought Cusack to his knees.<br/><br/>Biased on a short story by Steven King, this film gave a new hope to a genre that seemed to be loosing itself to the mainstream. Would it have not been as good had Kings name not been on it, or Cusack playing an erratic atheist? Perhaps not, but that just goes to show good casting can save a less then perfect script. All in all, the best way to describe it is Evil Dead meets The Shining, and if you're a fan of either of those, I believe you'll get your money's worth with 1408."
