","I'd have to say this is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing, just a few weeks ago. I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie.<br/><br/>A gorgeous color palette (man, this looks good) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with ""Scat,"" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. ""Sid"" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger<br/><br/>This isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters. This isn't interrupted with a lot of songs, either: one only brief one and there is nothing offensive, language-wise.<br/><br/>If more animated movies were this good, I'd own more."
"TuckMN","9","84","107","14 May 2002"," Great fun for everyone that has a sense of humour.
","With a relatively small budget for an animated film of only $60 million the people at Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios have done an incredible job.<br/><br/>They have combined state-of-the-art digital animation, the perfectly cast voice talents of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Dennis Leary (among many others) to create a highly entertaining, family film with a strong message about cooperation, friendship and caring for your fellow herd members. And how sometimes it takes many different creatures to make up a herd.<br/><br/>While watching this film I got a strong political message about getting along with the people that share your space -- maybe it should be required viewing for all world leaders!<br/><br/>David Newman -- yet another member of the Newman family of Hollywood composers -- provides a superb score that is not intrusive yet serves to move the action along and, at times, is positively toe tapping.<br/><br/>The overall look of the film is incredible; an intensely coloured, strangely believable fantasyland of snow, geysers, mud, rocks and ice. The individual characters were delightfully believable too, with the facial expressions of Ray Romano's Â‘Manfred' being a particular treat.<br/><br/>The entire sequence with the DoDos will leave no doubt as to where the expression `Dumb as a DoDo comes from.'<br/><br/>This is a good family film that keeps the things that could alarm or frighten children pretty much sanitized -- but real nonetheless.<br/><br/>It would be a great movie to see in the theater and to buy for home."
"vegetable_milkshake","10","60","77","25 March 2005"," A great warm, funny movie in the golden age of 3D animation.
","I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in '02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth.<br/><br/>We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.<br/><br/>Also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.<br/><br/>Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.<br/><br/>All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out."
"TxMike","Null","37","46","4 January 2003"," A time in history when animals could talk, but humans couldn't yet!
","In what amounts to a throw-back to the early, manually-animated cartoons, ""Ice Age"" chooses a very simple story around which is wrapped clever and exciting animation. Highly intelligent sabre-tooth tigers want to get revenge for the killing of one of their pack, so plot to steal the baby son of the human tribe leader. A goofy sloth (Lugiezamo) and a kind wooly mammoth (Ray Romano) rescue the child and attempt to find his parents, joined by a sly tiger (Denis Leary) who at first is planning to lead all of them into a corner so his tiger friends can help get the child back and eat the mammoth. But a series of events, and the tiger's being saved by the mammoth, causes all of them to ""bond"". <br/><br/>The DVD is flawless. The Dolby surround sound is remarkably good, truly surrounding you with sound. The direct digital to DVD video transfer is as good, colorful, and sharp as the other recent ones like ""Toy Story 2"", ""Shrek"", and ""Monsters Inc.""  There is a whole second disk of ""extras"" which take you through the whole animated film-making process. Also a short animated film ""Bunny"" which won an oscar in 1998. Plus another ""short"" which shows the little squirrel, 20,000 years later, in an ice block drifting onto a deserted island, and his pounding of a coconut into the ground triggering the continental drift which resulted in the present day continents!  Very inventive and funny.<br/><br/>Watching ""Ice Age"", my wife and I noticed that much of the action and pratfalls reminded us of the old ""Roadrunner"" cartoons. In the DVD extras the director mentions that those old cartoons of Chuck Jones were the insriration of many of the scenes. Yes, a throw-back to the old manually-animated cartoons, and a worthy tribute."
"tfrizzell","Null","30","37","27 November 2002"," Oh So Very Cool.
","Excellent computer-generated animated feature that makes a case for one of the finest films of 2002. It is the frozen era and prehistoric animals try to find their way to land that is warmer and drier. An early group of human hunters become the hunted themselves as a group of sabertooth tigers begin to plot revenge. As an attack occurs, a small infant child is taken out of harm's way. Enter a kind wooly mammoth (voiced by the priceless Ray Romano) and a silly sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) who find the young child and decide to return it to the humans. It appears that a sabertooth tiger (Denis Leary) is helping the duo, but his motives are devious as he is trying to lead them all into a trap of other sabertooth tigers. The film is another great animated piece of film-making that has important messages for the youngsters and is also highly entertaining for all audiences. 5 stars out of 5."
"SILV3R","9","71","95","19 September 2002"," CGI fun for all.
","This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek, but is different in its less cartoony feel (despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures). The story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end (its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves) but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different ""animals."" You know the outcome, but you can't help being drawn in.<br/><br/> The characters themselves are far more than their voices (the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices), unlike most Disney movies. They are well rounded and completely believable, strangely. The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations and quirks are subtle and enjoyable. You will find yourself rooting for them far sooner than you would like to think.<br/><br/> The animation is brilliant, as you would expect, and you will be praying for the opportunity to go on the ice slide in the movie. You will fall in love with the characters, especially the comic relief of the prehistoric squirrel and its desperate attempts to bury its nuts. I came out wanting the obligatory merchandise, especially the sloth toy, only to be disappointed the next day when I couldn't find anything vaguely related.<br/><br/>Which, strangely, makes the movie all the more pure.<br/><br/> Better than Monsters Inc or Shrek."
"Buddy-51","Null","42","54","28 November 2002"," cute, clever, entertaining
","`Ice Age' emerges as one of the better animated films of recent years, cleverly designed and even more cleverly written.  Scenarists Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman have devised a story set 20,000 years ago about an unlikely trio of companions who find themselves making a long trek through a harsh environment in an effort, ostensibly, to return a baby human to the tribe from which he has become separated.  The triumvirate is made up of a deadpan, cynical mammoth, a wisecracking, over-the-top sloth (whose mile-a-minute mouth more than makes up for his legendary slowness) and a malevolent saber-tooth tiger, who learns a thing or two about friendship and teamwork before the adventure is over.<br/><br/>`Ice Age' is at its most amusing in those scenes in which the characters make prescient jokes about their own place in the evolutionary scheme of things.  One particularly clever scene involves the three travelers discovering what looks like an underground museum of natural history encased in ice, replete with ancient creatures caught in naturally occurring, chain-of-life exhibits.  Like most animated films set in the past, `Ice Age' derives much of its humor through the use of anachronism.  We chuckle to hear these creatures applying modern, scientific knowledge to the pre-scientific era in which they are living.<br/><br/>The animators and designers have done a beautiful job in achieving just the right look for this tale.  The backgrounds have a colorful, clean, streamlined look to them, and the animals themselves, in their appearance and design, provide a witty commentary on evolutionary history.   Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary do superb voiceover work, each achieving just the right tone for the character he has been assigned to play.  One could wish, perhaps, for a bit less sentimentality at the end, but that is a minor quibble in a film that works so well for both children and adults.  The kids will revel in the cuteness of the animals and the clever action sequences, while adults will savor the sly knowingness of the evolutionary and historical in-jokes.  Not bad in an era when most films can't find a way to please even ONE audience demographic."
"Psy Dragon","7","32","41","5 March 2002"," Very nice looking pic!
","Just saw ICE AGE, a very funny and especially nice looking film. The story is simple but effective, the characters lovable and nicely fleshed out but what really shines is the digital set design.<br/><br/>More inspired by traditional animated movies than reality, the designs give you a really, really nice looking world in a astounding use of colour. Sometimes the touches of reality shine through (especially the water was impressive), but nonetheless, it's a fantasy-world based on reality. Including loads of vast landscapes especially helps to minimise the costs of rendering.<br/><br/>Pixar films shine with technical brilliance, this one shines with effective uses of technical know-how.<br/><br/>Enough technical babble, the film's entertaining, family-friendly and sometimes just hilariously funny."

","I'm always way behind the curve on these animated features, this one by about a dozen years. I don't know how that happens but time does go by. Maybe because I've seen so many films, I have to conclude that the story here wasn't very original or exciting, but on the plus side, young kids watching will probably get the message about teamwork, friendship, loyalty and integrity. Animation wise, I thought there was room for improvement with some of the characters but that was offset by the vivid use of color. I did get a kick out of the Tae-Kwan-Dodo bird gimmick, that was pretty funny. Overall, a passable story and recommended for the younger set, so if you have youngsters in the family, treat them by watching along side."

","I saw the movie with two grown children. Although it was not as clever as Shrek, I thought it was rather good. In a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break, there was not a sound so I know the children all liked it. There parents also seemed engaged. The death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate gasps and comments. Hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids. As such, it was successful although I liked it too. Personally I liked the Scrat!!"

","This was great. I liked it better than I did Shrek, by far. 'Manfred' and the Squirrel really take the cake here-excellant voice work, nice animation of the character faces, Denis Leary was a hoot too....with just the right amount of an edge, as is usual for him.<br/><br/>Some of the vignettes-the Dodos, (You've got three melons), etc are right up there with anything Pixar has done. I also thought that the little montage of Mannfred's parent's(cave drawings come to life) were done well too.<br/><br/>As for the messages-'Non-trad families are okay too-', people can work together, etc.-well, all are pretty obvious and all that-but it's not hammered home ala Disney, and you also don't have anyone breaking out into song, either.<br/><br/>See it for the Mammoth and the squirrel, though the Sloth is fun too. Cute kid baby too, not far removed from 'Boo' in Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>*** outta ****"

","Being only a kid when I first saw this, I didn't know what to expect. I had never heard the name of this movie, and being brought into this world when classic animation was still ""in"" (and thankfully being brought back), computer animation was still new to me at the time. So, I went to the theatre having so-so expectations, and I walked out smiling. But... now I look at it today, and occasionally I find myself reaching for a tissue. The story is so well told that I found myself laughing at most of Sid's antics, and Scrat's, which have never gotten old for this movie by the way... ever. But, now being old enough to understand, I also found that the implied, but still tragic, death of Manny's family being revealed is one of the saddest moments in this beautifully animated film. Nonetheless, it is still a great movie that has an even better message for kids, and a few in-jokes for adults, too."
"bsinc","9","11","16","17 September 2003"," Funny and touching
","Finally I got to see the infamous ""Ice Age"". Apart from maybe not being as dead funny as I'd hoped for after seeing the brilliant teaser there is not a bad word I can say about it. Sure, it's not as glamorous as a Disney production(besides, it is Fox's 1st attempt at a full length CG movie) but it's got immense heart and on some occasions(like the look in Manfred's eyes after we see the sad glimpse of his past) I found myself on the verge of tears. But when they reunited the baby with its father I just couldn't hold them in anymore. A movie that has no trouble walking on the thin line of sappy and clichÃ© and manages to bring more than the best out of it; the end result being one of the most touching animated creations I have ever seen. Great funny looking characters that quickly grow on you(and great voice talents as well) and many funny memorable scenes, especially from Scrat's behalf make the movie more than enough reason to give it a go. Plus the Dodo scene, which is my personal favorite funny scene of 2002.<br/><br/>I honestly don't get it, but for some reason it really looks like CG animation will be taking the upper hand in the future. But if it just means that there will be more movies like this one (and who can forget Pixar's creations) then I don't really mind, at least for now. 9/10"

","Ice Age is perfect example of an animated film that's suitable for kids and adults.<br/><br/>The movie takes place during an ice age, where temperatures are going below freezing and animals are migrating south. However, a lonely mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano) is going the opposite direction. He then meets up with an irritating, but likable sloth, Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) and a kind hearted saber tooth tiger named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary). Manny and Sid find a human baby boy and want to return it to his tribe, while Diego tags along and pretends to do the same thing, when in reality, he's setting them up for a trap. So it is up to the three misfits to survive through the coldest weather of all. There's also a saber tooth squirrel named Scrat who all he wants to do is find a spot to bury his acorn, but always gets into messes.<br/><br/>Ice Age has a very unique plot. The characters are very likable and funny. The animation is good, however it does have the worst animation of all of the Ice Age movies. But that's not a bad thing because they went from good to better in this case with the sequels.<br/><br/>The voice acting is also very good. They got a great cast to voice these characters.<br/><br/>The pacing for the movie is also fantastic for 80 minutes.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Ice Age is an excellent movie for all ages."

Spite of the fact that 'Ice Age'has many flaws and scientific errors,like humans,sabers,dinosaurs and mammoths living at the same period, and even the location of where the story passes(looks North America,but has some characteristics from Iceland for example) we can have fun even so.(unless you are very severe!) <br/><br/>The planet is entering an ICE AGE, and many animals are immigrating to the south where is warmer.

The mother dies but Manfred and Sid decides to take him and return the baby for the humans. Diego, one of the sabers, decides to follow and help them to go to a shortcut to the human's camp.

"michael-colan","8","4","5","10 November 2012"," Although it may not be Original we are Won Over by the Great Characters and Humor
","Around the early 21st century computer animated family films had really taken off. Through the recent hits of Shrek and Monster's Inc, people started seeing money in this business. So in Blue Sky's first ever animated film they may have not been very original but the film known as Ice Age has enough charm and laughs to be very acceptable.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the Ice Age when a sabertooth cat, a sloth and a mammoth take in the care of a lost baby and attempt to return it to the humans who have lost it.<br/><br/>Now the story is really a cross between Shrek and Monsters' Inc. In Shrek we have the lonely character (in this film is Manny) getting crossed in the path of a lovable idiot (Sid the Sloth) that is faced with a quest and in this film it's returning the baby. Returning the baby part is just like Monster's Inc. where the characters have to return a little girl back to her room. So really story wise the film isn't that original and it's not like a good homage, it feels a little too noticeable in places. Usually when a film does this it takes me right out of the movie but because of the characters and the funny stuff they get themselves into I can't help but ignore this ""big"" problem.<br/><br/>The characters are the best part of the film. Manny the Mammoth is the lonely character that would rather be left alone then be bothered by anyone else. He doesn't like people (or the other animals) and he really doesn't want to deal with stupid things. Yet for an animated film he has a rather deep character with a dark past that is explored in more detail later in the film. But also he is really funny making the sarcastic remarks and other smaller jokes that is really funny. Ray Romano really shines in this part and makes a mark as a different character and doesn't play Raymond Barone from Everybody Loves Raymond.<br/><br/>The next character is the stupid and lovable and funny Sid the Sloth. He isn't that deep of a character but he really doesn't need to be. All we need to know is that he cares a great deal about the rest of the characters and just wants to be accepted. Other than that he really is ""the funny guy"" and he is really funny. John Leguizamo creates a very memorable character filled with great jokes and gags and memorable lines.<br/><br/>The final character out of the main ones is Diego the sabertooth cat (tiger)and he is another fantastic character. He is at first set up as the villain and throughout the film you can never tell whose side he is on but you can tell that he starts to care for the other characters. Denis Leary voices him and is a great talent and a great voice. He can be serious and funny at the same time and just like the rest gives us a great show.<br/><br/>As a bonus we get a side character named Scrat. He is the Wild Coyote of our times. He presents us with no dialogue but a good dose of some fantastically funny slapstick humor that will always make you laugh. The character has nothing to do with the story and he is just there to give a few extra laughs and the character works.<br/><br/>The humor is the film is very well done. It may not be ground breaking by any means and some jokes are recycled from other films but really the rest of it works completely. We get slapstick humor, smart humor and some plan old good old fashion jokes. All work well and should be enjoyable for every age group.<br/><br/>There are also some good animated action sequences, some of them really fun (like the ice cave sequence) and some of them very tense and exciting. All of them of course have jokes in there even the more serious sequences with the exception of the fight at the end. These sequences are great for people of all ages and will be enjoyed by people of all ages.<br/><br/>Another thing the film has is a lot of heart. Throughout the film you get this theme of family and love and even loyalty along with friendship. Parts where Manny's Character is explored more is very touching and might even come as a surprise. Also near the end where we finally see Diego as he true self is also very touching and well done. Also where the characters first save the baby after the rest of the humans lose it is also very well done. In fact this film was originally supposed to a Drama instead of a family animated film but Fox would not accept it as a Drama and wanted it to be a family film. But I think a lot of the Drama Elements still carried over to the final film without being in your face about it. The film has a lot of themes and really a lot of heart which is something that is missing is a lot of recent non-computer animated films.<br/><br/>The animation on the film is really good too. It might not be as good as Pixar or DreamWorks buts it wasn't trying to be. The film has animation that looks very good and state of the art but it maintains a more classic animated film. So the animation is good but it's nothing grand and I think it works for a film like this.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line is this is a very funny animated film that has some great animated characters and is very well drawn out and funny and even though the film sometimes feels like a copy of other films the film has enough charm and touching moments to make us forget about it.<br/><br/>Final Score <br/><br/>8/10"
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","10","4","5","25 January 2012"," The best Non-Disney film that reaches the emotional levels of Pixar before Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon
","Generation after generation, Pixar and Dreamworks Animation has started to become very successful CGI animation companies creating such great hits like Toy Story (1995) a story about toys who come to life and face many villains and many dangers in lost of their adventures and Shrek (2001) about an ogre who is sent on a mission with his donkey friend to rescue a princess in an epic tale of pop culture references, but before they continue making more groundbreaking movies, Blue Sky Studios, a division of 20th Century Fox Animation, seems to be facing those two companies as they make their first debut in the CGI animation genre by making this their very first masterpiece from the past ten years, ""Ice Age"", a story about three Paleolithic animals named Manny, a mammoth, Diego, a saber-tooth tiger, and Sid, a sloth on an adventure to return a baby to the human tribe.<br/><br/>Considering that I watched this a few times on video when I was little child after it's release in theaters in 2002 and still loved it even as a young adult, this film is the best non-Disney film that reaches the emotional levels as Pixar before Dreamworks' How To Train Your Dragon which also became a masterpiece in 2010 after this one.<br/><br/>The story is very original with likable characters and includes touching and emotional scenes where Manny discovers that his kind were killed by the humans and I actually felt sorry for him seeing how we humans had done such a terrible thing in killing animals in terms of live-action and animation. It also has hilarious dialogue and laugh-out-loud comedy including where Diego and Sid try to cheer the baby up with Sid getting hit by Manny causing him to make a weird face which caused me to laugh my head off.<br/><br/>The strongest aspects of the film are the animation and the voice cast. The visuals are lovely with the impressive look of the mountains and the look of the ice glaciers while having great character animation with the animation on the animals as the best. The voice actors are great. Ray Romano did a good job as Manny, Denis Leary did great as Diego, but I think John Leguizamo as Sid and the evil saber-tooth tiger named Soto (which is, in my opinion, the best non-Disney villain in an animated film since Rasputin from Anastasia due to his dark nature and intent on killing the baby) voiced by Goran Visnjic steal the show.<br/><br/>The orchestra score from David Newman is also the strongest aspect of the film with a great opening sequence and a great song ""Send Me On My Way"" while having a mixture of drama, suspense, and emotion.<br/><br/>Since this film became so popular it spawned two sequels with a fourth one coming this year, but not only that. It became a start of Blue Sky Studios' career in making other CGI films including Robots, Horton Hears A Who, and Rio and although not as compelling as this film, they were both enjoyable and fun. Since I still loved it, Ice Age will remain one of the greatest masterpieces of computer animation since Toy Story."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","8","4","5","28 February 2005"," Much better than it seems
","From the commercials and trailers, this movie looked pretty good. When I saw it at the theater, it was really good, much better than I ever would've expected.<br/><br/>The animation is quite stunning. The story is good too, with plenty of good points about working in a team and overcoming hardships together as one.<br/><br/>This is often compared to Shrek, while I think that Shrek is an entirely different type of movie. Even though the sloth in this movie does kind resemble the chatterbox donkey in Shrek, the two films are much different. Both films have great animation. The animation in Shrek is more colorful, while in Ice Age there is snow everywhere, so the main ground color is white.<br/><br/>I'm sure most kids will enjoy Ice Age, even the 13 year olds will probably enjoy it too. People in the age area between 14 and 16 might think other wise.<br/><br/>This is great, it is thrilling, enjoyable, and has a good meaning deep inside. This is one that, unlike many children's films, will probably entertain the whole family, and yes that does include teenagers."

It says something about the sophistication of our society when a cartoon aimed at 6 year olds has something this intelligent in concept. <br/><br/>Here we are watching a cartoon, and at one point the cartoon characters watch a cartoon. Their cartoon is placed at the same distance of abstraction from them as they are from us. More, that cartoon tugs on the same strings as the one we are watching: parental loyalty in a situation of natural violence.<br/><br/>We are growing a set of young minds that easily understand manifold selfreference and complex multilevel ironies.

"bikini_bottom_7","10","7","11","27 January 2006"," Overall review
","I thought that Ice Age was an excellent movie! As a woman of 30, with no children, I still seem to really enjoy these humorous, witty animated movies. Sid is the best character I have seen in some time, better than Bartok in Anastasia (although he was really humorous, and I did not think that his character could be matched or even beaten) and even more humorous than Melman in Madagascar. I have seen the movie at least 15 times (I own it obviously) and I quote the movie at work (on many occasions...yes,still). My favourite scene is the part where Sid says ""Oh, oh, oh, I love this game!"" and Sid and Manny continue to figure out what the squirrel is trying to tell them about the ""tigers""...""Pack of wolves, pack of bears, pack of fleas, pack of whiskers, pack of noses, pack a derm?, pack of lies, pack of troubles, pack a wallop, pack of birds, pack of flying fish..."" or however that part goes! That is THE funniest part about the whole movie, although I also really enjoyed the humour behind ""putting sloths on the map"" and many other parts as well. The only animated movie that can remotely compare to Ice Age is ""Brother Bear""."

","This is one film that my family has had for a while, and we have no regrets about it whatsoever. The story, despite (just in my pointless opinion) its lack of decent humor (while there are some occasional chuckles), has enough touching moments and action to make it an excellent diversion for audiences. The animation is very well done by 2002 standards, utilizing the help of brand new rendering technology that can render minute details like fur very well (despite how in some areas, it was still quite primitive, such as dug-up ice not leaving holes where it came from). The characters aren't exactly funny: rather, they're touching, cold, dark, and overall characters that will be appreciated or depreciated for the right reasons. Despite having some references that are obviously out-of-place in its timeline (including possible foreshadowing in the cave scenes), it sums up to one of the better animated movies of 2002. It isn't Lilo and Stitch, but a view is as warranted as an Ice Age migration (which may come soon)."
"MUFCOK","8","2","2","21 July 2015"," A film I watched countless times, which I then re-watched years later only to find it less enjoyable than I remembered.
","Ice Age is a good movie, there is no doubt about that. As with most popular animation flicks, it appeals to all ages and has a decent enough mix of humour to keep all the family entertained. I loved Ice Age growing up and have memories of it being one of the favourite animated movies of all time. Having re-watched it at weekend, 7 or 8 years after previously viewing it, I felt a little flat. Sid seriously carries the film, many of the jokes and the majority of the dialogue comes through him. The supporting cast all do a pleasant job, Manny is entertaining and they do share some good chemistry but the film relies heavily on Sid's presence.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but compare Ice Age to two very famous animated movies. The relationship between Sid and Manny and the unlikely relationship that they develop is reminiscent of Shrek and Donkey. The way they take care of the baby, taking him into their tribe, naming him Pinky and looking after him and getting emotionally attached as they search for his parents, reminded me too much of Monsters Inc. I don't know how I didn't see these comparisons in the past but upon recent viewing they were far too blindly obvious.<br/><br/>With a run time of less than 1 hour 20 minutes, Ice Age really struggles with the pacing. It takes 20 or so minutes to introduce all the characters and get the plot in order then it flies through the next hour! We see scenes which could have added a little more depth - the drawings of Mammoths on the cave wall for example, this was brushed aside very quickly which I thought was a shame. I personally think Ice Age could have benefited with being 15-20 minutes longer.<br/><br/>With the negatives that I have mentioned above being considered, I still think Ice Age is a very good film! It is funny, feel good, caring and creative. An aspect that I especially liked was that the animals didn't have a home, they weren't based anywhere, it was essentially a road trip. They moved from place to place, out of their comfort zone with only each other for support and guidance. I appreciated the message behind the story and enjoyed how the movie panned out as it progressed. The on screen relationship between Sid and Manny is very well done and Diego is a decent enough addition to the group. The story is pleasant if not a little clichÃ©d and the comedy is a decent mix of slapstick and subtle humour. This is certainly the strongest film in the Ice Age franchise and certainly worth a watch!<br/><br/>8/10"
"smakawhat","7","2","2","16 March 2002"," Mildly Entertaining
","Keeping up with the standard Disney fair, heartstrings are pulled, comic side kicks abound, and funny looking computer animated characters are created once again.. Is it any good?  Well It seems to be fairly good for kids and adults alike..<br/><br/>Take a tree sloth, a wooly mammoth, and a sabertooth tiger who end up adopting a child in hopes to return it to some humans tribe.  While the animation looks great and some of the voices are a perfect match (particularly Ray Romano as the Mammoth), there is still a lot of formulaic plotting meant to sheepishly tug at your heartstrings..  The animation is quite good, particularly a running repeating montage involving a squirrel like character and his desire to crack an acorn throughout the film.  There are also some pot shot humour that is clearly aimed at kids, (gags involving doo doo) and adults alike (We have to be the most screwed up herd in history)..<br/><br/>So I guess all in all it turns out ok, but not a good picture, yet not a bad one either <br/><br/>Rating 6.5 out of 10"
"The-Sarkologist","5","4","6","2 March 2019"," Entertaining, but nothing new
","I had this idea that this film, and the sequels, are basically about this squirrel, which is actually a sabre tooth squirrel, named Scrat, that is running around trying to do something with its acorn. Well, it is sort of like that but it is sort of a lot more than just that, he really is only something that sort of happens in the background, but he does keep on popping up throughout the story, and not surprisingly the movie opens with him, and closes with him.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is one of those films that I have actually been meaning to watch for quite a while but never really got around to it. I guess being as old as it is now sort of starts to give some character to it, and it also makes me think that maybe there is some actual staying power to it, especially since a number of sequels (four) were spawned out of it. Well, it turns out that this was not really the case.<br/><br/>So, other than our squirrel, which is really only a background character, the film is about how a Wooly Mammoth named Manfred, and a Sloth named Sid are attempting to get a human baby back to their parents. The catch is that humans aren't actually seen as being all that nice - not only are they predators but they are apex predators, which is why the sabre tooth cats sort of have a problem with them.<br/><br/>Yeah, this is one of those quest stories, but it is also a story about how three unlikely people are thrown together and end up becoming good friends, particularly since one of them is a sabretooth tiger and sort of has some rather dubious ulterior motives. Then again, as can be expected with a lot of similar films, we can probably work out where this is all heading.<br/><br/>Manfred is rather interesting though because he is a lonely and brooding character that seems to be going against the grain. Everybody is migrating south, but he is heading north. As for Sid, well, he is just plain annoying, namely because he gets left behind when everybody else sort of decides to head south - they basically decide not to wake him up.<br/><br/>I guess I could say that this film was fun, but honestly, there really wasn't all that much with it that made it stand out from all the other films that seem to come and go over the years. Yeah, it had staying power, but the catch is that new moves have come along, and all the kids who grew up with this film are all adults now."
"Starfiremyst","10","4","6","15 April 2008"," Ice Age: The only 2002 film that is not Sylvialess
","""Ice Age"" is one of the cartoon movies ever produced by Blue Sky Studios and released in 2002 as the company's first. We are introduced to the main characters: a squirrel named Scrat (voiced by Chris Wedge, AND PLEASE NOTE: the sound of Scrat's screams is the sound of Tom's screams from the ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons), a woolly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano of ""Everybody Loves Raymond""), a sloth named Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo of ""Titan A. E.""), and a saber toothed tiger named Diego (voiced by Denis Leary of Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"").<br/><br/>The movie opens with Scrat trying to bury an acorn and right after that, he caused an avalanche. We then see a herd going south for the coming Ice Age (except for Manny, who is going the other way looking for other mammoths that looked like him). Sid comes out of his cave yawning, and saw that his family abandoned him. He then pays toll with some aardvarks. Unfortunately, he gets pursued by Sylvia (voiced by Kirsten Johnston of ""3rd Rock from the Sun""), a female orange sloth, who wants Sid to go migrating with her. Sid eventually teams up with Manny, and they became friends.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, nearby a human tribe, Soto (voiced by Goran Visnjic), an evil saber toothed tiger, wants revenge against the tribe's leader for wiping out half of his pack just by stealing his infant son, Roshan, away from him. In the morning, he, Diego, and Soto's henchmen, Lenny (voiced by Alan Tudyk), Oscar (voiced by Diedrich Bader), and Zeke (voiced by Jack Black) attacked the tribe, but the leader's wife escaped with Roshan and gave him to Manny and Sid to look after. Eventually, Diego joins them, and went on a journey to return Roshan back to his tribe, who are also looking for him as well. Relax and watch the rest of the movie and find out, okay? Besides Manny, Sid, Diego, Scrat, Sylvia, and Roshan, the supporting characters in there including a pack of wolves that Roshan's tribe are using, and not to mention a fat female purple sloth named Jennifer (voiced by Jane Krakowski), and a skinny female yellow sloth named Rachel (voiced by Lorri Bagley), to whom Sid shows them Roshan as they relax in a tar pit. Incidentally, the two rhinos, Carl (voiced by Cedric The Entertainer of PDI's ""Madagascar""), and Frank (voiced by Stephen Root of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo""), who go after Sid for ruining their meal and confront Manny on a cliff, are simple minor characters. Same went for the dodos, who are using melons as their food supply.<br/><br/>The gags in this movie are very funny. For instance, Manny talks through his trunk saying, ""I'M NOT GOING!"" When Jennifer and Rachel are out of the tar pit, Sid asks Jennifer ""What do you say if we jump into the gene pool and see what happens?"" Jennifer then responds to him, ""What do you say if you go jump into the TAR PIT!?"" Rachel also then kicks Sid in the waist. Sylvia sees Diego holding Sid by the neck with his teeth, then she asks Sid if he's holding his breath, tells Diego to eat him, and promptly walks off.<br/><br/>Since ""Ice Age"" is not only a success, but it has 2 sequels: the first one was ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"", which was released in 2006, and the other was ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"", which is going to be releasing next year. I can hardly die waiting to see what ""Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" will be like."

His slothy slur was just too much for me.  By about 5 minutes in I was sick of hearing him talk.  Aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good.  There were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better.  This is a good movie for kids. It has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids.

","Who decided that characters getting pummeled, squished, slammed, zapped, whacked, and impaled is funny? Yet, as I cringed while Scrat and Sid were forced to endure one indignity after another, the kids and parents around me were laughing their butts off. Somehow, this didn't surprise me.<br/><br/>Although it implied some of the violence and death, I found ""Ice Age"" to be unusually cruel. I was especially disturbed by the dodo bird sequence. It was not only historically inaccurate, it was vicious. Good thing they've been extinct since 1681, otherwise, Fox would be shilling out mucho dinero to the dodos and their lawyers. And, the watermelon concern also has grounds for a big-time lawsuit as well.<br/><br/>Shamelessly manipulative and paint-by-the-numbers, it's no better than Disney's recent offerings. Manfred's story was an obvious play for our sympathies, but he's not likable to begin with, so it was hard to empathize with him.<br/><br/>My hopes were raised when Diego comments that the baby will become a hunter and he might, someday, hunt them! But the film makers didn't have the guts to explore the moral and ethical questions just raised, especially in light of Manfred's story. It reminded me of the soldiers in ""Saving Private Ryan"" discussing the stupidity of 8 guys risking their lives to save one then the issue being dropped: it was patronizing and insulting.<br/><br/>And why did they add on that coda? Talk about cold! Hadn't Scrat suffered enough? Leave the poor thing (and his acorn) alone!"

When the pair come across a human baby that has just escaped a sabre tooth tiger attack they plan to return him to his village but have to enlist the help of one of the tigers to help track them down.  But can they trust Diego?<br/><br/>Someday I'm sure we will tire of CGI animated tales of creatures that all have famous voices and sharp wits, but so far that day has yet to come.  Ice Age doesn't totally stand out in the field of really enjoyable films within the genre (I'd say Shrek, Monsters Inc, Toy Story) but it is funny enough to be worth watching.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't matter all that much suffice to say that a quest is undertaken and lessons are learned about friendship Â– so far nothing new. What it does allow is plenty of comedy set pieces and jokes that, as usual, are aimed at adults as much (if not more so) than the children themselves. Ranging from quick visual gags to longer physical stuff for kids it is all quite enjoyable.  The only weakness I felt it had was the lack of a really sharp edge Â– most of it is quite average rather than being imaginative and hilarious.<br/><br/>The cast do pretty well.  As much as I dislike him as an actor (too many bad performances!) Leguizamo does a really good job as Sid and carries a lot of the film.  Romano is a solid Manny while Leary never really gets to use his comedy skills as Diego Â– although thinking of his old acts, maybe that's for the best here!<br/><br/>Overall I didn't feel that Ice Age stood out as one of the better of the recent genre but it is still funny and worth a watch.  If I'm honest it did sort of put me in the mood to go and watch one of the better ones in it's class."

"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","2","3","28 September 2006"," Sub-zero heroes on an adult-humoured adventure
","I've been having a bit of an animation treat lately with films such as Robots, Finding Nemo, Shrek II and Ice Age Â–and while I may have had my favourite all along, this viewing cemented ""Ice Age"" as the best of the bunch. It holds up amazingly well since its primary focus is not meticulous animation (like DreamWorks focus on), but story and humour. Sure, you could probably find an animated film with more heartfelt messages and substance than this (Finding Nemo), but I dare you to find a funnier one. This film remains completely unrivaled in the laugh-department.<br/><br/>Its sequel, Ice Age: The Meltdown, rode largely on this humour advantage throughout and unsurprisingly suffered a few pitfalls when it attempted to 'get serious' by adding morals and messages. Thankfully, Ice Age does not have this problem because it knows it is mostly funny and it makes no pretense about it. Make no mistake however; it was originally written as a drama and therefore still has a lot of story to fall back on Â– the story of three outcasts turned Sub-Zero heroes (Manny the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger) joining up to return a human baby to its herd Â– and all the detours, diversions and conflicts that this journey entails, pinning the stunningly hilarious prehistoric rodent-squirrel Scrat somewhere in between, collecting his acorns. No words can describe how funny this character is but the special short on him on the DVD extra material should give you some idea.<br/><br/>So if there is just this one template story and humour, without heartfelt messages Ã¡ la Disney/Pixar and meticulous fluent animation Ã¡ la DreamWorks, then how does it manage to be such a great film? I don't know, but it is likely that its success stems from the fact that it lacks these very aspects of its peers. For example, it does not indulge in homages and references to the same extent as DreamWorks (except one little Star Trek joke squeezed in) and it never falls prey to predictable sappiness in the same way that Disney does. Without these things it therefore NEEDS a great backstory and fun characters to fall back on Â– and it truly does.<br/><br/>It is a bit more adult-humoured, too. There is a continuous gay joke with the rhinos Carl and Frank, for example. It never resorts to fart or pee jokes (ok - fine, there is a poop-joke, but so what?). There is an hilarious joke about modern architecture Â– Manny walking past Stonehenge and remarking on how ""it'll never last."" There is subtle use of irony in all the animals being able to express themselves eloquently while no humans talk in the film. It's insightful. The children's side of things is best tended to by John Leguizamo as Sid, who has clearly done something very cool with his character which ends up catering just as much to adults as its target audience Â– which is probably true for the whole film.<br/><br/>8 out 10"

The movie is sometimes very funny and sometimes really moving. The ability to pass from laugh to tears is noteworthy. The characters are nicely shaped and very different in order to make their association very surprising. Yet, this combination makes the quality of the pack and allows our heroes to overcome the various challenges they meet on the way. As in most Disney movies,the motivation and values shared by the animals can be translated into human beings. It makes Ice Age a very pleasant and entertaining movie for all."

","Reading the reviews of this film, I was skeptical that it was something I would enjoy. The plot is indeed rather contrived, but the film has a charm that won me over completely. The animation, while hardly realistic, is nevertheless convincing. The voicing is great and the main characters just perfect (Diego was my personal favorite). Good music too. Rating: a rather surprised 8/10!"

","Millions of years ago (or thousands, depending on your religious beliefs) a squirrel-rat forced an acorn into a crack in the ice, causing an avalanche that kicked off the Ice Age.<br/><br/>At least, that's what this silly diversion of a movie would have you believe.<br/><br/>And the comic relief provided by that squirrel-rat character (known as Scrat) as he repeatedly tries to find a hiding place for that acorn is the highlight of an otherwise uneven but sporadically funny, though at times mean-spirited family movie.<br/><br/>After the Ice Age hits, herds of prehistoric mammals start migrating towards warmer temperatures.  A sloth named Sid (voiced by a lisping John Leguizamo) gets left behind by his family (not surprising, considering how annoying this odd-looking little creature is) and takes up with a brooding woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a pack of sabre-tooth tigers led by the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic) attacks a tribe of primitive humans.  One human mother manages to get away with her baby, but is chased down by Soto's second-in-command Diego (Dennis Leary).  Soto commands Diego to bring the baby back at all costs.<br/><br/>And wouldn't you know, the baby is found by Sid and Manfred, who decide to guard him and get him back to his family.<br/><br/>Essentially a road movie without cars, the rest of the plot follows the adventures of Sid, Manfred and Diego in their trek across the tundra played mostly for laughs.  Which is why the occasional lapses into dramatic territory (such as the revelation of what happened to Manfred's family, and the rather violent end that comes to one of the villains) seem to come in from another movie altogether.<br/><br/>The animation is good, but noticeably inferior to the similarly plotted MONSTER'S INC; but then I don't think they were going for realism here.  All of the characters look like three-dimensional cartoons.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a passable time-killer with a few good laughs, and a storyline that's just predictable enough to keep you comfortable.<br/><br/>Sort of like a comfy old coat that's been worn a few too many times."

If you were to compare ICE AGE to SHREK, the Mammoth takes the part of Shrek, while the Sloth takes the part of the won't-stop-talking Donkey. The squirrel you've seen in the trailers is actually a transitional character added mostly for comic relief between scenes. He adds a Road Runner style to the film. <br/><br/>Filmed in three-dimensional computer animation (similar to SHREK) the film is visually quite good. While SHREK played well to audiences of all ages, ICE AGE is aimed more towards kids. But adults will love it too. I found the final scene (featuring the squirrel) worth the price of admission.

Carefully timed and executed references to things that adults would recognize elicited well deserved giggles and chuckles from the moms and dads, leaving children wondering what the fun is all about.

However, when comparing it to some of the other main animated family films of the 2000s, I can't agree with the ratings that put it among the best. For me, 'Ice Age' isn't in the same league as classics like 'Finding Nemo' and 'The Incredibles'.<br/><br/>'Ice Age' is a good animated film that works for all ages, but I can't help but feel it is a little overrated.

There are also very sincere and emotional moments, like a mother willing to sacrifice everything to save her child, a mammoth longing for a family, and a villain becoming a hero.

"mitsubishizero","7","1","1","24 May 2019"," Ok though a little dated
","I grew up watching this as a kid and I have to say I enjoyed it then and I still do now. The jokes are funny, the characters have well defined likable personalities and the animation's nice though by today's standards it's somewhat dated but I'll get to that.<br/><br/>The story's about a misfit trio journeying during the ice age while looking after a baby they find. Sid(John Leguizamo), a clumsy yet well-meaning sloth trying to reunite with his family bumps into an irritable mammoth named Manfred ""Manny""(Ray Romano) and an enigmatic saber tooth tiger named Diego(Denis Leary) who may have a hidden agenda.<br/><br/>Meanwhile a saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat struggles to find a place to store his acorn leading to several hilarious gags that indirectly effect the trio on their quest. Will they get to their destination without killing each other? I'll let you decide that. What it lacks in animation it makes up in story. The story's nothing new but what pulls it through are the characters and their chemistry. The jokes don't always hit but when they do they get a laugh. The scene where they're walking through the snow with the baby has some pretty good gags such as the scene where Sid throws a snowball at Manny a few times leading to Manny finally throwing a snowboulder at him.<br/><br/>Sid could easily be annoying but he has charm and Manny to bounce off of leading to some funny scenes like the one where he's forced to change the baby's diaper. They're like an odd couple and Diego's the third wheel. The baby also gets some laughs too. There's a scene where it test Manny's patience by pulling on his nose hairs leading to Manny hanging him on a branch threatening to leave him there. I thought that was funny.<br/><br/>The animation's fine though though as I said earlier some of the textures feel off. The snow never feels right and the people look somewhat strange and rubbery. The fur also doesn't feel real in how it looks and moves. Again that's just nitpicking. For what it is it's a good family movie. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself."

","Definitely the best in the (what would soon be) franchise. I say that even if other people say that the franchise as a whole is awful, at least check this film out. While they aren't wrong in saying the other films in the franchise are terrible, this one holds a special place in several people's hearts.<br/><br/>Since the story's too good to give away, i'll simply fill you in on the characters.<br/><br/>I enjoy Sid's personality a lot. He's a small, wimpy guy, but tries his hardest to make some form of impact. From some sources, it was said that he was intended to be a hustler/con-artist, which I would have liked to see. I think Diego is quite enjoyable as well. In my option, he should have had somewhat of a redemption ark given he wasn't the nicest when the group first met him. However, they make up for it in a short, but sweet reveal sequence when he bids a key character farewell.<br/><br/>I think the character that really breaks the ice in this film is Manny. He's the largest, loudest and most threatening in the ragtag group of misfits, but won't hesitate to stand up for his friends. The backstory of his family is very saddening to me, most likely because i've gone through something similar to it.<br/><br/>Ice Age might have some problems in it's story and it's CGI hasn't aged super well, but for what we got, it's a fun little movie that'd i'd like to see a few more times in the future.<br/><br/>One final note. My favorite scene from this film (and the entire franchise) is the opening with Scrat. No dialogue. No music. Just the low howls of wind and the saber-toothed screw up doing what he does best; wreaking havoc."

","When Ice Age was released in 2002, computer animation was still pretty new, but it was one of the best visual films.

The story was different, and it wasn't Disney, so it was kind of slow at first, but still a fairly good family film. The animation and settings were beautifully done.<br/><br/>Even sixteen years later, Ice Age is still a popular film that has spawned a franchise, including four sequels so far. Ice Age was also the first feature film from Blue Sky Studios, who later brought us Rio, Epic and Ferdinand. Ice Age was also honored with being nominated for best animated film at the Oscars, but lost to Spirited Away.<br/><br/>For the voice acting, Denis Leary stood out as the best of the cast.

But regardless of questionable originality, the story is very emotional with lots of gags and witty remarks and 80 minutes will fly by in a jiffy.

","Ice Age is an enjoyable family film with something for everybody. I don't think it's something spectacular, but what we get is enjoyable. <br/><br/>This is a buddy comedy story we've seen before, but it is executed well with each character providing their own sense of humour ranging from the mostly goofball slapstick of Sid to the deadpan from Manfred and the similar style from Diego. <br/><br/>But it's not only fun and gags, because these characters are actually pretty well made. Even though Sid primarilly plays the role of the socially inept one whom nobody wants he is both kind and brave when he needs to. Manfred may seem grumpy and stern, but their is a sad reason to that (no spoilers). Diego gets into their trip with a completely different agenda than when he pretends to have and that makes some good tension between the three of them. <br/><br/>My only little issue with Ice Age is that the animation hasn't aged very well. Even compared to other animated features of its time it is not that great which is shown best in the human characters' unnatural look. You can't blame it for that, because it's a first from Blue Sky Studios and they did a great job. <br/><br/>Even though it's been milked with pointless sequels which went in a completely different way than I had hoped, people seem to like it, because the box office performances sure don't lie. It all started with this enjoyable feature with good humour, good characters and some powerfull moments."

"SimonJack","7","1","1","16 August 2017"," This animal bunch entertains all ages
","This is the first of what was to become a series of animated films with animal characters living in the ice age. Ostensibly for children, it carries a PG rating. It could be because of some of the mild violence that's shown, and some of the scary characters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ notably the lions. But more than likely, it's because of the humorous dialog that at times is adult. Indeed, I think ""Ice Age"" and it's follow-up films were made more for adults than for kids. <br/><br/>It is funny and entertaining, and I think suitable for the whole family. It's one of a small field of films that all ages will sit still for. The little tykes like the fuzzy, cute and bug-eyed animal characters. The young kids and teens will like the action and antics. And adults mostly will enjoy the dialog. <br/><br/>This one was a big hit and the sequels continue to draw the crowds.

","Establishing Blue Sky Studios as the new player in the computer animation arena after both Pixar & DreamWorks Animation had made their mark, Ice Age is a sensibly crafted, delightfully humoured & wonderfully narrated adventure comedy that packs in an interesting set of pre-historic characters, manages to be surprisingly touching on few occasions & is thoroughly amusing from start to finish.<br/><br/>The story of Ice Age takes place during the advent of the titular global phenomenon and follows a woolly mammoth named Manny, a ground sloth named Sid & a saber-toothed cat named Diego who, after coming across a human child & ultimately deciding to return him to his tribe, embark on an exciting adventure while braving the harsh conditions & unexpected challenges of the worsening weather.<br/><br/>Directed by Chris Wedge & Carlos Saldanha, Ice Age sets its lighthearted tone right within the opening segment that follows a squirrel's obsession with acorn and this side story keeps recurring throughout the movie to provide the comic relief. The main plot itself is brilliantly narrated, the characters are introduced without swaying from the main premise, and it has plenty of laughs in store for everyone.<br/><br/>The relationship between the characters develops naturally, the computer animation appears a bit dated today yet it's top-notch for its time, the pre-historic animals are nicely designed & rendered on the screen, the cold colour palette, smooth camera-work, fine editing & adventurous score also helps in uplifting the experience while Ray Romano, John Leguizamo & Denis Leary chip in with fitting voice work.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ice Age marks a promising start for Blue Sky Studios and delivers the goods in sufficient doses to succeed as an enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying picture that will appease the appetite of both kids & adults. Wonderfully balancing its moments of comedy with sincere drama, further strengthened by terrific chemistry between its three characters, and exploring the theme of friendship with genuine warmth, Ice Age is definitely worth a shot."

Also to have Denis Leary is amazing as the saber toothed tiger Diego. He throws you off because you often hear a swear word laced in his speech.

While all the animals are migrating north Manfred an outcast is heading south. On his way Manfred is joined company by Diego and Sid. They encounter a women swept on a river bank trying to get her baby out of the freezing water. Manfred and Sid make it their mission to return the baby to ""its own herd"".

","'Ice Age' was the break which introduced Blue Sky Studios to the world; in other words it was their own lower class version of Pixar's 'Toy Story' and Dreamworks' 'Shrek'.<br/><br/>It cannot be compared to the original 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek' due to the fact they were and still are some of the finest movies to hit the big screen. They both have incredibly strong and likable story-lines as well as better characters with more developed personalities. However, 'Ice Age' is able to stand on its own two feet more than comfortably with numerous features such as its humour, its emotional presence and its strong visuals. Impressively, these fine features are consistent throughout the first three films although the fourth appears to be an anomaly in what was an entertaining franchise.<br/><br/>When Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) makes an unlikely partnership with Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), they attempt to return a lost child to its family. Sly sabre tooth Diego (Denis Leary) secretly pretends to join forces with the duo however his actual intentions appear to be with his herd.<br/><br/>As the audience, you will develop feelings for the characters and bond with them as the duration unfolds. Romano, Leguizamo and Leary provide fantastic voice works for the main trio of characters as they provide good on-screen chemistry as well as bags of enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the stronger animation collections out there, the original is awarded seven thumbs up!"

","Dream works keeps coming, hitting, but then missing. I have a hate/love relationship with their animations, but once in a while they'll hit the mark; hence Ice Age. Now this film takes the setting of the ice age and very cleverly executes it with a hint of wittiness and even a hint of emotion. The movie adventures through all these events that happened back then, and makes it funny. We even get the hilarious scene of the Dodo bird extinction. This is what makes the film for me, because they executed this setting very cleverly. <br/><br/>The voice acting was pretty good, and the jokes were hit well. But instead of my praising of the film, I have to give it a dosage of my complaints. The characters, although funny, seemed very bland. I know that's saying a lot, because I know lots of people love these characters and their antics, but me? I don't know. They were new and original but I think they could've done something more with them. Maybe it was the plot, where they kind of took a shortcut by placing a baby in there to insert some clichÃ©d jokes. Maybe it was the atmosphere they chose. Or maybe it was the mood I was in when I watched it. Whatever it was, I still enjoyed it and found it to be a great and original animation film, especially for the hit and miss Dream works. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I recommend watching Ice Age. Although I found something about it offbeat, the movie still delivers a great amount of wit and fun. I reckon the kids will enjoy it more though, and it would make out to be a great weekend movie.

","Manny, Sid and Diego, a mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger, form a surprising trio as they journey through the ice-ridden mountains of the Ice Age to return a lost human infant that they found. However, one of them has a hidden ulterior motive..<br/><br/>I remember that I watched this movie twice in theaters in 2002. I was laughing like there was no tomorrow when this was out. Granted, I was quite young- about 7-years-old or so. The good memories that I had of this film were what pushed me to re-watch the trilogy. :)<br/><br/>Re-watching the film now, I can see that the story line was a bit too simple. Just fit for a kids film. If I was still the 7-year-old me that had watched this years ago, I would have given this an instant 10. But time does things for people, and for that I'm giving it a 7.<br/><br/>""Ice Age"" is a GREAT film for young children. Or even parents watching it with their children. It will garner lots of laughs from the silly antics the trio get themselves into."

","This is simple: this feature has all: great characters, original story, excellent design, matching score! A lot of animations try to be funny but fail: here's i laugh from the beginning to the end, thanks to Sid, Scrat and his nut. Next, the other animations want also to move the audience but fail to carry the message in an easy way: here, the friendship between the trio and the family values are depicted simply and directly: no boring dialogs, through painted cavern for example! At last, this animation is superb with his close ties to Nature: the environment is stunning: simple and soft colored! The animals, even the heroes, stay animals: they don't try to fake humans. In conclusion, this animation is a classic and you will be very happy to share it with your kids!"

","This is a simple yet entertaining film that children, along with parents will all enjoy. This film is set back 20,000 years ago where three eccentric characters team up for an unexpected adventure. This is a story about Manfred (Ray Romano), a woolly mammoth, Diego (Denis Leary), a saber tooth tiger, and Sid (John Leguizame), a sloth. These three cross paths as Manfred the sad and lonely mammoth decides not to migrate south with the rest of the animals where he runs into the stuttering and fast-talking Sid the sloth. As also seen in the movie Shrek, Sid becomes a follower of the loner. The two together run into a lost child. To Sid and Manfred he is a lost child but to Diego the child is prey. Diego was ordered to bring this child back to his pack as the pack sought revenge on the humans. Diego deceptively offers help in returning the child back to his family and their journey begins across mountains of ice. This awkward combination of characters brings humor and comedy to the screen. Not to forget one of the most humorous and speechless characters alone, Scrat, a half squirrel, half rat that has set out on a mission of his own. In doing so, each character learns to work together and eventually become friends. Their differing personalities mixed together provide for a mission full of laughs and giggles. This films simplicity allows watchers to just sit down and be entertained. <br/><br/>The voices of all the characters were impeccable. From the stutter of Sid to the grave tone of Diego. These animated voices brought these characters to life and provided personality. This personality contributed to the adventures of this team's journey.<br/><br/>This film reaches out to children as well as the adults. The simplicity of the film plot allows for children to easily follow these lively characters throughout their journey. This film also shows depth as it looks brings details to the characters. From the beginning of the film Manfred was seen only as a loner deciding to travel north alone. His character was expanded with reasoning as he viewed the art within the cave. This brought great continuity to the film as each of the characters brought their contributions to the team. Ice age was simple and entertaining enough for children pleasure and added enough depth and emotions for adult interests. Entertainment for the whole family!"

","Pretty good film if you ask me. The majority of movies with prehistoric creatures were commonly dinosaurs. But what about mammals? <br/><br/>Neanderthal Man, Austrolopithicus, Saber-Toothed Tiger and of course Wooly Mammoth. Werethe only well known ones that roamed the screen. This film introduces us to lesser known mammals that prehistoric animal fans (like me) heard and read about, like the freaky Macrauchenia, the short rotund Moeritherium, the armadillo ancestor Glyptodon and a pair of tough Borntotheriums. Now this film is as funny as SHREK, the first part is copying SHREK, except the rest of the film involves bringing a Baby Neanderthal back to it's family. It mixes drama with action and comedy, but all the comedy dominates the movie. This film was nominated for an Oscar and it deserved to be nominated (because of SPIRITED AWAY). <br/><br/>Alland all, this is a good movie and it was a box-office smash! I liked it. I saw it's sequel (comment coming soon) and I can't wait to see the second sequel.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>Rated PG for mild peril."

","I think too many people compare this to Monsters' Inc and Shrek in terms of animation quality. I also think that this film would have been a lot more successful, had it not been released too soon to Monsters' Inc. I thought it was a well-written film and in some case sweet too. The animation is spot on, and when I saw it at the cinema, the whole room were in hysterics in the first five minutes, because of Scrat, who was one of the funnier characters. The voice work is highly commendable, especially Ray Romano as Manny and Denis Leary as Diego. John Leguizamo has his moments as Sid. The script was well written, very funny, but sometimes especially towards the end, when the humour could have been more focused. I actually liked the sentimentality brought into the story. The baby, is one of those characters you love or hate, I warmed to him, but i never empathised with him. Although, I was really moved by the bit where Manny is seen staring at the drawing with the hunters killing mammoths. Anyway, the music score was perfect. All in all, a funny and sometimes touching picture, that had a tendency to get a bit slow, but overall this is misjudged by people. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"sddavis63","8","1","1","14 March 2008"," Exceptionally Well Done
","Marvellous animation, a good story and fun characters all add up to make ""Ice Age"" one of the better ""kids"" movies I've seen. The story - set during the Ice Age - revolves around a giant sloth named Sid who stumbles across a human baby, and decides that the baby should be returned to its family. He enlists the reluctant help of Manfred the Woolly Mammoth, and the duo then first do battle with Diego the Sabre-Toothed Cat, who wants to capture the baby, and then, through a series of adventures, manage to turn Diego into a somewhat surprising and surprised ally.<br/><br/>Sid is clearly the highlight of the movie. He provides most of the action and most of the fun - a giant sloth who just can't keep still or keep quiet. And yet, for all the humour Sid injects, I appreciated that there were some serious plot elements in the movie as well. The trio stumble upon some cave paintings as they seek out the baby's human family, and a painting of a mammoth family obviously makes Manfred remember his own family, who were apparently hunted down and killed by humans. This also helps to explain Manfred's rather gruff exterior, and penchant for aloofness. Diego's apparent death scene near the end of the movie also injects a dramatic feel, although, on that note, I question the decision to bring Diego back at the end of the movie. His ""death"" was a poignant moment, and made the point forcefully of what we should be willing to sacrifice for our friends. Since Disney killed off Bambi's mom, it seems that animated children's stories have wanted to avoid the reality of death. Having said that, the combination of the three (or four, if you count the human baby) points out that families come in many different shapes - ""it's what herds do"" is the repeated mantra as Sid, Manfred and Diego (as unlikely a herd as you could imagine) find themselves coming to each other's rescue over and over again as the story progresses.<br/><br/>There's some great satirical material here: as the trio trudge southward to escape the ice, Sid reflects wistfully that some global warming would be great, and I appreciated the irony of the fact (as was pointed out by one of the characters) that, in this movie, animals could talk and humans couldn't! The portrayal of the dodo birds was also quite hilarious.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an extremely well done family movie. 8/10"
"Andy-296","8","1","1","4 March 2008"," Enjoyable and well done animated film
","A very enjoyable animated feature, whose plot is loosely based on 1948's classic western from John Ford Three Godfathers. Set during (of course) the last Ice Age, the story has a mammoth called Manny, an annoying sloth named Sid and a duplicitous saber tiger called Diego finding a dying human mother along with her baby. They decide to return the infant to their tribe, against all odds, and facing a series of predators (especially saber tigers, who count on Diego on helping them on the inside). Punctuating the plot, a squirrel tries to save an acorn in a series of very funny vignettes. And a running joke is that the only species that do not talk during the movie are human beings. Unfortunately, the graphics are a bit below standard (they are no match for Pixar's works). The sequel has better graphics but a far less interesting plot (though it has a very funny final scene)."
"DavidSim240183","8","1","1","12 February 2008"," Cold surroundings, but a warm story at heart
","Ice Age marked the debut of Blue Sky Studios, another player in the arena of computer animation. Pixar remain the undisputed kings of the field. Just about every film they turn out is an absolute delight. And even less received films like Cars and Ratatouille have that magic Pixar touch.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if Blue Sky are what you would call a truly great studio. Their films are amiable enough to make them instantly likable, but they somehow lack the shrewd intelligence of a Pixar film. Still, judging from Ice Age, Blue Sky have the potential to go onto a very promising future. If not a great one.<br/><br/>Set 20'000 years ago, animals are on the move to find warmer climates now the Ice Age has set in. Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo), ditched by his migrating family, gets on the wrong side of a couple of hot-headed rhinos. But he's saved (reluctantly) by Manfred, the Great Wooly Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano).<br/><br/>Latching onto Manfred, Sid comes across a baby human. His tribe were attacked by a pack of sabre-toothed tigers, and his mother managed to get him to safety before she died. Sid takes it upon himself to return the little tyke to his people, with Manny's help of course. But they have to contend with Diego the Sabre-Tooth (voiced by Denis Leary), who says he's out to help when really he's leading them into an ambush.<br/><br/>Ice Age, although a reasonable box-office hit, could have brought in more money if it had opened in cinemas before the likes of Monsters Inc and Shrek. Because when you're watching Ice Age, its impossible not to think of those two films. Manny is the sullen giant saddled with Sid's annoying chatterbox...Shrek & Donkey. And the baby often reminds you of Boo, in the care of Sully and Mike Wazowski from Monsters Inc.<br/><br/>But to say Ice Age is predictable is to shortchange its virtues. Because although its a rather slim film plotwise, it has surprising depths and unexpected charms.<br/><br/>Manny, Diego and Sid are all quite well written. Granted they tend to seem a little generic. Manny's the loner who gradually thaws. Sid's the annoying sidekick who provides comic relief. And Diego's the unknown variable faced with a moral dilemma. But they're all voiced well by the actors, imbuing each character with a separate identity.<br/><br/>Especially impressive is Denis Leary, who plays it totally straight for once. He never launches into the rapid, manic monologues that he seems to enjoy. He almost makes Diego seem dignified. And its an appealing moral dilemma the writers have laid at his feet.<br/><br/>Half of Diego's pack were wiped out by human hunters. And he's supposed to bring this baby back to the people who slaughtered his own. The rest of Diego's pack are interested in settling the score, by feasting on Junior, so Diego is supposed to deliver him to them. Quite an interesting problem isn't it? And Leary rises to the challenge admirably.<br/><br/>Ray Romano and John Leguizamo are both on good form. But its really Denis Leary who shines. He totally convinces you of Diego's struggle. Whether or not he should give in to his instincts. Or rise above them for the greater good. Its a great piece of characterisation. Madagascar tried the same thing. To much lesser effect.<br/><br/>From the way I've described the film, you'd think it was a dramatic endeavour solely. But there are plenty of laughs to be had. Particularly appealing, and something that was a common staple of the trailers are the sidesplitting adventures of a squirrel trying to bury his beloved acorn. But because the ground is frozen solid, he can't achieve this one simple task.<br/><br/>Everything he does to bury the damned thing sets off avalanches, earthquakes, lightning strikes, you name it. The scenes with Scrat the Squirrel are actually the funniest thing about the film. What I especially liked is they're told in complete silence. Scrat never talks, but he has an endless supply of squeaks, grunts and exasperated facial expressions on his neverending quest to bury that acorn. He arguably goes through more trials and tribulations than our trio.<br/><br/>The filmmakers include obstacles for Manny, Diego and Sid to circumvent. A common theme for this type of film. The trip through the ice tunnels is a hair raiser. As is our heroes encounter with a lava flow. And in between the action, there's a quite poignant scene where through a cave painting, Manny relives the extinction of his herd. Its a scene where the film holds still for a few minutes, and allows you to feel Manny's pain.<br/><br/>One thing I thought was an especially nice touch is the film's depiction of humans. They don't talk. Probably because they haven't mastered the mysteries of the human language yet. And in a neat twist, its perfectly natural to see an animal talk instead of a human. Its nice to see a film finding the time to take something like that into account.<br/><br/>Also, Ice Age is mercifully free of film references and smart-ass hip colloquialisms. Things that have sunk many an animated film. DreamWorks is a particularly guilty offender. Blue Sky have no desire to distract us with adornments like that, because they're clever enough to know the drama is a strong enough hook to bring in the audience. And they're right.<br/><br/>Ice Age is visually appealing, even if it doesn't have the razzle-dazzle of a Pixar film, but the characters dilemmas are really quite enough to draw us in. It may seem like an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, but its much deeper than that (and much better too!). Surprisingly forthright (the death of the baby's mother). Funny at a lot of the right moments. And its charming and heartwarming. Great theme from David Newman too."
"Victor Field","Null","1","1","30 March 2003"," The settings are cold, but the movie isn't.
","Twentieth Century Fox hasn't had the best of luck with animated movies -""FernGully: The Last Rainforest"" is best forgotten, ""The Pagemaster"" was patchy, ""Anastacia"" wasn't bad but was unmemorable, and ""Titan A.E."" was a misfire (in addition to helping shut down Fox Animation Studios). ""Ice Age"" finally delivers the goods through Blue Sky.<br/><br/>This is well animated than Walt Disney Pictures's own prehistoric trek ""Dinosaur"" but a better movie all told, because it has characters on its side - a sloth and mammoth trailing behind in the annual migration to get away from the winter discover a human baby (given to them by his mother, who dies in escaping a tiger attack) and take it on themselves to return the child to his people before the snow sets in and closes the only route available. If dave-hart is reading this, the reason they're joined by a sabretooth tiger called Diego is that he's been sent by the leader of his group to get the baby from Sid the sloth and Manfred the mammoth (""I see - can't have kids of your own, so you want to adopt"") and bring him back, so that his revenge can be complete; the tigers attacked the humans because the baby's father hunted the tigers. As Mrs Loman put it, ""Attention must be paid.""<br/><br/>The storyline won't win any awards for originality, but the movie has plenty of points of interest (the mute human characters - ""You know humans can't talk!"" - in accordance with the true first settlers of America, have distinctly Native American looks), and enough humour and genuine appeal to win over most viewers; the flock of survivalist dodos preparing for the imminent Ice Age are my favourites among the subsidary characters, but the three main characters all get to share the spotlight. As the one who's the most nebbishy, Sid could have been truly annoying, but he stays the right side of amusing throughout (kudos to the writers and John Leguizamo); Manfred is good enough to suggest another look at ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" may be in order, and as for Denis Leary as Diego... well, when is he NOT worth the time?<br/><br/>It is a bit predictable, and it's not Pixar admittedly, but it's not as self-satisfied as DreamWorks either; it's just a movie. But it's a good one - entertaining from the running joke of Scrat and his nut to the final scene. ""Ice Age"" is the best prehistoric cartoon since ""The First Bad Man,"" though not quite up to Tex Avery level... but then again, what is?<br/><br/>And please note the absence of dinosaurs (and singing). Already this is more accurate than some live-action movies."

","Ice Age is the latest of the 3D animated features aimed at that magic demographic Â– the children's movie adults can be dragged along to. Shrek, The Toy Story Double and Monster's Inc. have been huge successes in recent years.  Ice Age will do pretty well.<br/><br/>                Ice Age is less sophisticated than the others though, with a story line less likely to excite the intelligence of older viewers.<br/><br/>
Still Ice Age has its more cerebral moments. It's set while animals are migrating to beat what looks to be at least pretty harsh winter. Three youngster mammals are playing in a tar pit or mud hole. Their mother tells them to hurry up and join the herd. `You can play extinction later.'<br/><br/>In a fun sequence the creatures are walking through an ice cave and enclosed in the walls are the entombed bodies of previously extinct animals. Then we see evidence of alien visitors from millenniums past. The anti evolutionists will be tutt tutting to the max.<br/><br/>But the star of the show is a creature you'll see in the shorts for the feature. It's a desperate, jerky squirrel trying  to bury his acorn. He pops up throughout the film and is a fascinating show stopper.<br/><br/>Ice Age mainly concerns three animals trying to return a baby human to its species. A wooly mammoth, a sloth and a saber toothed tiger unite in an uneasy alliance and test the odds trying to get baby home.<br/><br/>The animation is of course astounding but seems sadly lacking when the humans hove into view. We seem to be able to move a mammoth more realistically than a human. Perhaps the animators haven't put the energy yet into animating people.

But jumping from Yellowstone (Old Faithful) to England (Stonehenge) to France (Lascaux) seems a stretch, even if the world was one big continent at the time.  Not good for a children's movie...no wonder we don't know geography in America.<br/><br/>Character voices were good.  Ray Romano didn't have to stretch too much, and was effective as the Manfred the Mammoth.  Supporting cast was good as well. Goran Visnijic (Dr. Kovac, ER) as Soto, the alpha-male sabre-tooth?  I didn't even recognize the voice until the credits.  But in my humble opinion, John Leguizamo WAS Sid.  He did an excellent job voicing the character, and making Sid his own.  John has talent, I just wish he did more (maybe it is the To Wong Foo... curse.)<br/><br/>One last thing.  Sid bears an awfully big resemblance to the donkey in Shrek.  Sid is saved by a big scary Mammoth; the donkey, by ugly looking Shrek.  Sid makes the Mammoth his friend; the donkey, Shrek...well, I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  I hope next time Pixar comes up with something completely new.<br/><br/>I thought the little sabre toothed mouse (or whatever it was) would be the Jar-Jar of the movie, and ruin it.

Maybe I'm just too lenient on kid's films.<br/><br/>Okay, I saw the trailer with the little squirrel dude, whose name I think is Scratch. It was funny when I saw the scenes in the trailer, and it was still hilarious in the film. I guess I couldn't get enough of that squirrel! Generally I liked 'Ice Age', and it's characters such as Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego the Sabretooth (Dennis Leary), and I thought the voice acting was good too. Unlike 'Shrek', 'Ice Age' had a better villain in Soto the Sabretooth, and in general I liked the way they played with Diego's character although you knew how it was going to turn out. Quite sentimental in parts, but generally fun to watch, and extremely hilarious in many scenes. The animation was less realistic than 'Shrek' and 'Final Fantasy' but still very good and I preferred it! It was easier on the eyes, and you still got a sense that 'Ice Age' is an ""animated"" film more in the tradition of cartoons, than computer-generated effects.  <br/><br/>I'm an adult, and I fully enjoyed this film, and while I didn't expect it to be thought-provoking or insightful, I did receive my expectations of entertainment and laughs.

"HBeachBabe","7","1","1","17 March 2002"," silly and entertaining
","This was a fun movie. It's perhaps more ""silly"" and kid oriented than some other recent computer animated films like Shrek or Monsters Inc. which work on 2 levels.  The majority of humor here is physical, reminiscent of early Looney Toons cartoons or even Three Stooges style violence-as-humor horsing around.  The kids in the theater with me seemed to enjoy it.  The only concession to adult-level humor appeared to be a Pumbaa & Timon inspired possibly-gay rhino couple.<br/><br/>The message is pretty basic, involving standing by your friends, but that still didn't stop it from being fun.  And despite the carnivore vs. plant eater premise, and the humorous violence, the actual level of violent threat was minimal, with only one real death and that being off screen.<br/><br/>The animation style was interesting, looking more like claymation than computer. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. The surfaces looked smooth and realistically 3D. Like it was a physical object, but the blockiness made it clear it wasn't ""real."" But the look worked for the film. It certainly never looked computer created, however it also lacked that level of realism seen in movies like ""Dinosaur.""  These creatures and this world were highly stylized, from the sloth's wide set eyes, to the sabre-tooth's almost disembodied lower jaws.<br/><br/>The voice talents of the leads were quite well done, with each actor essentially playing himself (or his well known persona).  Ray Romano, plays the large wooly mammoth Manfred with an arrogance and attitude appropriate for his size, but with an underlying vulnerability and pathos.  John Leguizamo has the enviable role of motormouth sloth, Sid, essentially the comic foil to Romano's straight man (mammoth).  Dennis Leary is rather sedate as Sabre-tooth tiger Diego, toning down his usual hyperactive vocal mannerisms to a more kid-friendly level. His seems to be the only character who's appearance was modeled directly from actor.<br/><br/>A minor complaint is that aside from a brief opening ""migration"" sequence featuring a number of humorous prehistoric mammals, strange enough in appearance to rival any dinosaur (my personal favorites are the glyphodons, early ancestor's to modern armadillos), there are no female characters. This is a story for the boys, again reinforcing the Three Stooges style silliness.<br/><br/>A film the kids will love and parents will be able to sit through without squirming.  Depending on your tolerance for silliness, you may even enjoy it."

","It always seems to be with these computer animated movies, to have a charm all it's own, humor that usually works all around, and (a flaw to be sure) the same plot elements fitted into different settings (notice how friendship, betrayal and a climax involving kids in some way fit into every animated movie in the past 7 years outside of Antz).  Ice Age follows that tradition being the first 20th Century Fox computer animated movie from Bunny director Chris Wedge, and it has an undeniable sweetness that can strike young and old alike.  This also goes with the laughs too.<br/><br/>Manfred (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Denis Leary) join together, obvious un-wantingly at first, to return a baby to it's father. That's the plot-line and it works in it's typical way, borrowing from the two good computer flicks from last year as well (Monster's Inc. and Shrek). But what keeps young and old and inbetween alike in their seats is not the story but rather the good natured and silly humor, convinving if not always realistic surroundings and splendid voice work by the three leads.  A fine movie.<br/><br/>One more note: while Leary, Romano and Leguizamo show off their capabilities, I jest to forget who steals a good chunk of the movie- a little squirrel chasing after an all important acorn nut throughout the pan of the movie.

","(Caution: there may be some spoilers here, but I don't think there are that many.)<br/><br/>I saw this today and it was really cute. All the little kids in the audience (it was packed) seemed to love it and there were no really scary scenes that freaked them out. It's a clever movie, not amazingly original but still very cute.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simple. A mammoth reluctantly becomes friends with an annoying sloth (think Shrek here). They discover a Neanderthal/Cro Magnon baby who has got lost from his ""herd"" (family), and some saber tooth tigers want to eat the baby because he might grow up to be a hunter, and as revenge. The mammoth and sloth decide to return the baby to his parents with the help of a reluctant saber tooth tiger. A rat/mouse type of mammal who just really, really, really wants to eat its nut rounds out the cast, offering some humor throughout the way but never actually helping the mammoth, sloth, and saber tooth.<br/><br/>The plot is kind of simplistic--there are no big twists--but that's because it's a kid's movie. As a kid's movie it succeeds very well, and there were lots of gags that I (a teenager) and my mom laughed at."

"TheBabblingFool","Null","1","1","27 March 2002"," Puts Shrek on Ice.
","It's unfourtunate that every computer animated family friendly flick will have to be compared to the likes of the overrated Shrek from now on. On that note I will review Ice Age to Shrek. Yes, Shrek has better character models and a more realistic look to it, but the movement of those characters were stiff and rigid. Ice Age has a more simplistic style, a pretty basic look, almost like a cave painting with a little more detail and color (and it works). And the characters in this film bring back the classic nostalgia of the American slap-stick cartoon, which is slowly becoming extinct. I had a grin from ear to ear watching Sid the Sloth and the sabertooth squirrel flop, squash, and bump their way through the movie. The squirrel and Sid provide the physical humor (along with a bunch of Dodos) while the rest of the cast provides witty dialouge, common in most computer animated flicks. So get the kids, and go chill out at Ice Age, and watch some slap-stick and be happy."

"aisuru2001","2","5","12","1 April 2002"," Just a poor movie after Shrek and Monsters, Inc
","I have been very excited to watch Ice Age when I first saw the trailer. I thought this must be a cool movie, as much fun as Shrek or Monsters, Inc. I believe now that it was not as good as either, although Shrek is still my favorite. One idea was even almost the same as Shrek although Ice Age lacks the cool voices. The sloth's attempt to be the mammoth's friend is identical to the donkey's attempt to be Shrek's friend. It may be true that the writers/producers of this movie did not know of Shrek's story line but it still felt like a cheap way to make a movie with a similar theme. It is true that this movie may be more child friendly than Shrek but it also misses the edge and most of the humor of the other movie. The story is blatantly simple and reminds us of a cheap copy of lovely Disney movies. If you can avoid this computer animated feature, you won't miss anything. Actually the trailer was the best of the whole movie."
"mallory34","4","4","9","28 November 2004"," Just not funny
","I'm usually a big fan of computer animated movies, so I had high hopes for Ice Age because of its big budget and recognizable voice cast. However, I was a more than a little disappointed with the non-organic, almost polygonal animation of what should have been organic, believable characters. Character development wasn't believable, and verged on stereotypical, and the humor just wasn't funny. I was hoping for jokes and scenarios that would appeal to both adults and children, but any attempts at more adult humor by the movie didn't go over too well. Perhaps the worst mistake that Ice Age made was casting the monotonous Ray Romano as the voice of the main character. Normally, cartoon characters need a voice with range and variety, and Romanos voice was lacking in both. The only scenes that I partially enjoyed were the ones with the squirrel, but the running-gag of the squirrel never getting the nut got old quickly. If it's on TV, go ahead and watch it, but don't waste your time and money on a rental. I know that they pretty much hold the monopoly on computer animation films, but check out anything by Pixar instead."
"culbeda","5","3","6","24 June 2006"," Yawn...
","While graphically amazing, the story never held my interest and I found the humor lacking. It had style but VERY little substance with a forced morality lesson in tow.<br/><br/>I really don't understand why everyone was so jazzed about this movie. Maybe they were voting based on how well their kids liked it. As an adult, I was personally rather bored.<br/><br/>I only gave it a 5 because of the technical wizardy of the CG.<br/><br/>Well, since I'm forced to put in at least 10 lines, I'll also say that Ray Romano is talentless and continues to play the same character no matter what he does. He's even worse than Kevin Costner and Nicolas Cage."
"FeverDog","5","3","6","8 October 2003"," THREE MAMMALS AND A BABY? Exactly.
","I didn't think much ICE AGE. Never mind the drab visual look or the predictable plot.  What annoyed me was its unrealized premise.<br/><br/>I dunno, but why do these animals need to speak? Disregard, as I have, the fact that English wasn't around when the movie was set. What bothered me was the laziness of the scriptwriters. Wouldn't the movie be more creative if the animals didn't speak at all? How about telling the story through their own means - with body language and grunts and whatnot. What's the point in making a movie about animals if all you're gonna do is supply them with recognizable human characteristics? Sure, it'd be terribly difficult to make this movie without dialogue, but it'd be possible right? Think of all the money to be saved without hiring B-list actors to supply the voices.<br/><br/>This would also eliminate another gripe I had - the anachronistic dialogue. At one point Manfred spoke of a ""petting zoo."" Would zoos have been in existence at the time the movie takes place, much less the petting variety? Another quip had to do with a slalom; I don't believe any form of sport exist back then, especially not a sophisticated zigzag skiing type. <br/><br/>
I guess I'm too hard on these kiddie movies. I still haven't figured out exactly what Stuart Little is (a mouse, or a boy who looks like a mouse? And why doesn't his family treat him as such? Are they blind, or just stupid?), so maybe I should stop watching them."

That said, this might not be the best choice for really little kids.<br/><br/>As for the rest of us, enjoy the movie ""Dinosaur"" had mad delusions of being.

"Mrswing","1","9","28","26 July 2002"," the only person in the world to dislike this? Probably
","I disliked Ice Age from the time I first saw the trailer. So when I finally went to see it with my girlfriend to avoid taking her to Blade II, I was not looking forward to it but hoped for the best. Unfortunately my worst fears came true : I didn't like this movie one bit. The main reason is the character design, which I find to be hideous to such a degree that I cannot identify with any of the characters. Sid the Sloth looks yucky (like a really filthy plush toy), the sabre tooth tigre's facial features are just wrong, etc. Only the baby is appealing. I did find myself wondering whether I would have enjoyed the film if I had felt the character design was more attractive, but I doubt it somehow (I liked Shrek's designs but found that to be a big disappointment too, though still better than this). The plot is very predictable, the baby's mother dies but no one cares, the drama is wonky (the sabretooths cannot defeat a single human in their raid on the encampment - which makes them weak as villains - yet the immensely powerful Manny the Mammoth seems to be helpless before them in the finale though he can throw giant brontotheriums through the air with the greatest of ease), the emotional arc doesn't make sense (Manny has lost his wife and child to human hunters - so he finds closure by saving a human baby??? Very noble, but does this make sense? Saving the offspring of those who destroyed your life?), the creation of the bonds between the mismatched 'herd' never really gells, and the humour is to my mind very often forced. And I do not find Scrat's being picked on by fate to be funny in the slightest.<br/><br/>However, I know I'm in an absolute minority with this one. I just had to vent... :-)"
"Silverzero","10","3","7","18 January 2003"," Amazing, heartwarming, clever, hilarious, everything you could possibly want.
","Many critics and snobs say that this movie is adequate but doesn't compare with Monsters Inc and Shrek. Ice Age is much too under-estimated. It's better than Monsters Inc and just as good as Shrek. Perhaps the concept for the film may be familiar to the other two, but they were all in production at about the same time so you can't blame them for that.<br/><br/>It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny and is always consistently entertaining. The visual gags and the wit should appeal to adults and children of all ages. While in Toy Story 2, serious scenes dragged the film down and made it lose momentum, in Ice Age moments of sentamentality are heartwarming and engaging. But if you have problems with your inner-child, thats not my problem.<br/><br/>The cast may not be as well known as the vocal talents in Shrek, they still work perfectly together. Ray Romano exceeds Mike Myers (whose evident flaws were overlooked) as being the loner-like but lovable mammoth (Shrek was an ogre) and was highly appropriate for the part. No one will EVER match Eddie Murphy as the talking donkey, but John Lequizamo is a good contender as the comical sloth. Denis Leary is also very good. ER's Goran Visnijc is more of a Gene Hackman in ""Antz"" than a John Lithgow in ""Shrek"", and gives the film a darker mood instead of more comedy, which is fine in its own way.<br/><br/>It follows a familiar outline, but Ice Age is always entertaining and definitely the best animated movie of 2002. 8.1 out of 10."

","The first half an hour of this was so yawn-inducing, with cut-rate characters, and B grade ideas, that when the low-stakes conflict was introduced (returning a lost baby!?) I could not have been less interested. I turned it off with no interest in watching the rest. But then I needed something to fall asleep to later, so I put it back in.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie had no hope of being better than a mediocre animated 'Three Men and a Baby.' But the quality improves a little. I laughed a few times (""Iceberg ahead, captain!""). And the sequence where Manny relives the demise of his family is touching, and subtly done in a style of animation based on cave paintings.<br/><br/>The humans here are creepy, but then they're intended to be so. No one has ever provided an explanation on why the humans in Shrek are so damned stiff and disturbing.<br/><br/>The DVD is designed so poorly that if you put it in your laptop it will insist that you view the games menu and not let you access the movie, even if you just want to watch it."
"DICK STEEL","7","2","4","18 March 2006"," A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Ice Age (2002)
","I've missed this animated movie when it was out in Singapore a few years back. Since the sequel is hitting our shores real soon, I thought I'd better get myself up to speed with the original movie, lest I miss out on some references used in the sequel. You see, must do homework mah? It has been 4 years since this movie was released, but I am marveled at the level of animation detail that was already incorporated - the ice never looked as white or as menacing, and the scenes of water in this movie, could have been the real thing. It really is that good. Which is quite surprising, considering that Ice Age was only Fox Animation Studios' attempt after their initial offering of Titan AE.<br/><br/>The beginning of Ice Age comprised of that extra long trailer featuring Scrat (the part squirrel part rat animal) trying to bury its acorn into the ice. Yes, it's the same one, which lead directly to a scene which looked straight out of A Land Before Time. The prehistoric animals are making their way down south, but somehow, Manny the Mammoth decides to leave the herd, and head up north instead. He meets Sid the Sloth, and they begin an uneasy alliance - you know, the usual bored character meets witty-but-irritating character routine.<br/><br/>At the same time, some sabre-tooth tigers have ambushed some early-humans (they don't speak), and their prized target, a human baby, escapes. Diego gets appointed by the pack to hunt the baby down and deliver it, so that they can exact revenge. But alas the baby gets saved rather reluctantly by Manny and Sid, and Diego has to use its cunning to infiltrate the group, and complete its mission.<br/><br/>It's a simple movie with mature themes, infused with madcap comedy. I especially enjoyed the crazy sequence with the dumb dodo birds - after watching this, you'd think that they deserve to be extinct! But anyhow, central to the themes is that of sacrifice and friendship. It got played out really well, since you have a double agent amongst the group of unlikely friends. And it is precisely this that the sequel can be born.<br/><br/>As with most animation flicks these days, look out for some spoofs, especially in the cave (with the UFO), and pay close attention to the dialog - lots of gems to listen out for. It's an interesting caper, and the sequel, yes I'm awaiting.<br/><br/>This Code 1, two-discs special edition comes with features filled to the brim. The first disc contains an audio commentary, interactive games, both widescreen and fullscreen formats, and the usual audio selection and subtitles. The second discs comes with an animated short Scrat's Missing Adventure, an HBO behind the scenes special, a making-of documentary, 6 deleted scenes, 6 production featurettes, trailers, and a clip from Blue Sky Studio's Oscar winning film ""Bunny"". Whew!"
"Gandoon","4","2","4","24 April 2003"," Funny, but does not reach greatness
","This was a nice film, it was funny and so on but it had a major flaw: It embraces many classic Hollywood clichÃƒÂ©s. At points it is almost too much with all the classic plot evolution that can be found in a not insignificant number of other titles, mostly found in the adventure and action genres.<br/><br/>The dialog was witty in a very characteristic Hollywood manner and if you don't like that this film might get a little annoying but not impossible to watch.<br/><br/>The animation is surprisingly cubistic for a film made in 2002 and that could be allright if it were a stylistic move but that is not obvious from the film. If you compare it to such resent computer animated films as ""Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within"" and ""Shrek"", both are by the way made before Ice Age, you will probably be disappointed if you wanted a brilliantly animated film.<br/><br/>With this I want to say that this is a nice film, worth the time to watch but does not give much more than an average Hollywood production."

"LawTiger87","Null","2","4","1 December 2002"," Did I see the same movie as everyone else? What was the point? Boring & hard to follow
","In reading these reviews, I find it hard to believe that I saw the same movie. Ice Age had okay animation, although not as good as Shrek, a few funny scenes, but overall as an adult it did not catch my interest at all and I found myself to be quite bored upon renting it. I have no idea how kids liked the movie so I can not judge as to them.<br/><br/>I did not particularly like or identify with any of the characters (except maybe Scrat, the proto-squirrel trying to hide his nut who was rather funny). I also like for my movies to have a well-rounded, well-conceived plot, which Ice Age definitely did not. In most stories, such as Shrek, we understand the plot and root for the heroes to overcome problems or adversaries and triumph in the end. In this story it was hard to tell who were the heroes and who was not.<br/><br/>I need to preface my review in that I love the old Bugs Bunny cartoons. I also loved Shrek and think it still to be the most clever and witty animated movie ever, along with a cool soundtrack. Monster's Inc. and Toy Story were good but not great animated stories along the same lines and I have watched each of them several times for entertainment value. Therefore, I am not a cartoon slammer and I am not some old fuddy-duddy who does not understand what is funny and what is not. I don't try to look for some hidden agenda or deep, mysterious moral behind a movie, I just watch to get some enjoyment and fun out of it (such as Shrek).<br/><br/>And then comes ""Ice Age."" I rented it last week. Unfortunately, with ""Ice Age"", I was rather confused, bored almost all the time, and perhaps appalled at times by the meandering storyline that never quite connected up for me. The animation was okay but Shrek is a much, much better movie in all facets.<br/><br/>
*SPOILER WARNING* I won't go into detail as to the plot as that has been done elsewhere. But I could not really ascertain what we were supposed to feel in this movie? Was this a buddy movie, a morality play about helping others, ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"" or what? Very murky writing from what I could see as I could not gather what it all meant. I am not one to slam movies and can find almost anything good about the most awful movies I have ever seen, but I had no clue as to motivations or who we should root for --- the humans who apparently kill all animals, the Mammoth and sabertooth Tiger who are doomed as doomed can be due to extinction issues in real life, or<br/><br/>the sloth, who is rather stupid and the only one who should not survive anyway (See Jar Jar Binks - LOL).<br/><br/>But in ""Ice Age"" what was the motivation for Manfred the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Sabertooth Tiger, taking the human baby back to the hunters? Apparently we are to assume that they were ""doing the right thing."" Accepting that theory, then why was taking the human baby back to the hunters the right thing? One could assume that as far as motivations go, it might have been better to kill the human baby so that Manfred and Diego could live longer. After all, these were HUNTERS not Cro-Magnon vegetarians!<br/><br/>Also, at the end of the movie, I find it hard to believe that Sid would not hunt down his old sloth herd and that Diego would not find a new bunch of sabertooth tigers to hang with. The buddy-buddy connection was not as strong or believable as in Shrek. Especially, since Diego turns out to be a ""friend"" only in the last 15 minutes of the movie or so after leading Manfred and Sid to an ambush for the first 1 1/2 hours of the flick.<br/><br/>Maybe I am overly cynical, but in the flash-back scene, it appears as though Manfred the Mammoth had his entire family killed by hunters and now he is taking a baby back that will grow up and kill him, too? Is he stupid? Is this some kind of thorn in the lion's paw type quid-pro-quo?<br/><br/>Are we supposed to see some kind of profound life-changing experience, i.e, the Mammoth brought back the baby, I will never hunt again??? Fat chance of that, I would think. There is no connecting up so that we actually believe the hunters will not kill the animals ever again, so who are we to speculate?<br/><br/>Also, is this some kind of pro-vegetarian movie, don't kill the animals because they are the same as us? Fat chance again. Ice age humans lived a nomadic hunting existence and did not start agrarian societies until some 10,000 years later. So they did not establish farms or stay in one place as that was not possible with the advancing Ice Age. They ate what they could, which was mostly meat, along with berries, fruits, and what-not they picked as they went along. So the chances that they would not kill Manfred for food at a later date are slim and none. Not believable even in a kiddy movie context.<br/><br/>Don't forget at the beginning that either Diego or the head of his sabertooth pack says that the hunters have killed half their pack and that is why they want to kill the baby. So Diego helps take a human baby back, so the baby will grow up and kill him, too??? Is this believeable or am I missing something?<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, the main hunter never mentions what happened nor sheds a tear about the death of his wife (who apparently drowns off-camera), it is all about the male baby who will also grow up to be a hunter. And this is a kid's movie??? Very shocking/interesting undertones for a kid's movie. Not exactly the type of sentimentality engendered when Bambi's mother dies!<br/><br/>Also, for continuity's sake, I thought that Diego was trying to lead the Mammoth and Sid into a trap of the other sabertooth Tigers and not necessarily to the humans? However, coincidentally the humans and sabertooth Tigers are all in one place. I really did not see an entire pack, just 5 or 6 Tigers. They could have easily jumped the Mammoth and Sloth earlier in the film instead of supposedly letting Diego get the baby and bringing the baby to them.<br/><br/>Scrat the proto-squirrel provides some good scenes although he really does not fit into the storyline at all. The dodo dancing scene was interesting as was the Ice slide scenes. Even taken as a cute, funny kiddy story with no motives attributed to the producers, I didn't appreciate the undertones to the rhinoceros pair. This was truly not necessary. Also, as adults we know the Mammoth and the sabertooth Tiger are doomed to extinction, so this put a bad slant on the movie for me, knowing that Manfred and Diego were doomed from the get-go.<br/><br/>Overall, I would have to give Ice Age an 8 for animation, but a 2 for plotline and continuity. I did not really care much about the characters and did not really care what happened at the end. Here coming up on Christmas, I hate to sound like the Grinch, but this movie was not good at all for adults."

","Kids, adults, seniors, teens...everyone should like ""Ice Age."" It was funny, it had a good story, it was visually impressive, the voice cast was talented...what else do I need to say here? When an animated movie can feature the development of numerous characters only through the actors' vocal performances, I think that is a great accomplishment. Denis Leary especially, as Diego the sabertooth-tiger, goes through so much development. As a villain helping the heroes, its impossible to see which way he will turn when the climax comes. And when it does come, you feel as if you have just watched something amazing happen. Ray Romano and John Leguizamo also give immense emotional contributions to the story. All the actors gave this movie a charming element that is not encountered often on film. When the movie was over, I wanted for there to be more. But I'll be okay; ""Ice Age"" is a tremendously good movie."

Denis Leary was also a standout, making his presence felt even though his character wasn't meant for comic relief. A funny, solid film that doesn't last too long (only 81 minutes) and doesn't overdo any jokes. While the story turned out to be predictable, the little interludes with Scrat were rather entertaining."

","Totally unaware of what awaited me in the theatre I went to see Ice age, with a rebate coupon and a pretty funny trailer, it couldn't be that bad... At first I was afraid that the funny sequences from the two trailers would be the best clips from the movie cut into a nice teaser, but it didn't take long to get rid of that fear, as the fun just kept going & going for the whole film through!<br/><br/>The characters are extremely funny and really nicely animated, it's hard to believe this was not a Dreamworks or a Disney picture but for me at least a total newcomer in the animated movies genre not having seen Titan AE yet (even though this movie has certainly made me put it up in queue).<br/><br/>I do not get the criticism this movie has got from some of the early user comments. ""Ray Romano boring and depressed as the mammoth"" - A. Well, the mammoth was a depressed and sad character in the movie, so that shouldn't be such a surprise?! B. He did a very good job with the voice IMHO and was also really funny at times. C. This movie would hardly need any more energy than it already has, thank you very much!<br/><br/>Also, just because a few of the scenes reminds me of other movies (Shrek comes to mind at about 2 short scenes) doesn't make it any worse! All movies takes ideas and inspiration from other movies in the same genre and this one can definitely stand on its own!<br/><br/>Monsters has nothing compared to this movie, which is right now doing a major struggle in my mind for first place with Shrek. Can't wait for the DVD to come out! Just wish there is a nice DTS track and plenty of special features on it *hint* *hint*."

The story itself may not be the innovation of the year but the characters are so lovely - especially the unlucky squirrel which is so funny that it deserves a leading role.<br/><br/>To sum up, Fox hit it big with that movie and (in my opinion) even tops all the other great animated features like Toy Story, Antz or Shrek.

It was kind of funny for about a minute, then it just got annoying.  But like I said after a while you get used to it and just live to deal with it.

","The film Ice Age is very interesting. At the beginning of the film, I found to be under the impression that it was similar to the animated film, Shrek. This is because when Sid was following Manfred around, I immediately thought of when the Donkey kept following Shrek around. I could clearly tell that the writers of Ice Age thought through every single detail of the characters and the storyline itself and that is what is lacking in some films today. That extra bit of thought made this film to be one of the best animated films I have seen which is why I gave this film a 10. Overall, the characters made me laugh, the storyline was very unique and I enjoyed watching it."

","Having been blown away by what animated films are capable of in<br/><br/>the last year (Shrek & Monsters, Inc.) as far as cross-generational<br/><br/>humor, I was sadly disappointed by Ice Age.<br/><br/>All the reviews said, if you like Shrek and Monsters, Inc., you'll love<br/><br/>Ice Age.  The trailer made it look interesting, the cast was good,<br/><br/>and this movie had everything going for it.  Sadly, it didn't live up to<br/><br/>what it could have been.<br/><br/>The animation was poor by today's standards, with the human<br/><br/>characters looking more like GI Joe's than people.  The cave men<br/><br/>had square jaws, rigid lines, and twine hair.  Their movement was<br/><br/>jerky and unnatural.  It was a big step down from other recent<br/><br/>animated films.  The wind blowing through Sullivan's hair on the<br/><br/>ice covered mountainside in Monsters, Inc. comes to mind for<br/><br/>example.<br/><br/>Poor animation could have been overlooked, if it weren't for the<br/><br/>predictable plot and tired jokes.  At one point in the movie, an 8<br/><br/>year old boy sitting next to me turned to his friend and said, ""Oh my<br/><br/>god, this is so predictable, next he's gonna <insert spoiler here>"". <br/><br/>All I can say is that when an 8 year old finds a movie too<br/><br/>predictable, it's not going to keep me interested for long.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, I've enjoyed several other recent animated<br/><br/>films that offered something to multiple generations.  They<br/><br/>contained jokes that were clearly intended for a mature audience. <br/><br/>Ice Age had one or two, an amusing commentary on evolution<br/><br/>comes to mind, but for the most part, the jokes were all kid stuff.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, if you've got kids that want to go see Ice Age, by all<br/><br/>means, take them; I'm sure they'll love it.  If on the other hand<br/><br/>you're interested in something you can both enjoy, or maybe you<br/><br/>don't have any kids at all but are a kid at heart, I'm afraid Ice Age<br/><br/>may let you down."

","I first saw Ice Age in the Subiaco Cinemas when it came out, back in '02. I was only 13 at the time, but even then I liked it. It had some sort of warmth.<br/><br/>We've had it on video for a number of years now and no matter how many times you watch it, it never gets boring. This is because of the one element which makes it different from all of the other 3D animations made at the time - The characters have no particular 'home' which they leave. They are nomads, and that's really refreshing and uplifting to watch.<br/><br/>Also, each individual character on the surface, appear to be just putting up with each other, but they're really all good friends. As well, all of the characters have their own charms (even the bad guys). Sid the sloth is charming in his annoying, over-affectionate and naive sort of way. Manny is adorable in his depressed, reclusive character, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>Another great point about the movie is the beauty of the animation. All the environments and characters were modeled originally by clay, giving the film an artistic edge.<br/><br/>Another aspect that adds to the feel of the movie, is that gender means very little. There are hardly any female characters, but you don't really realize that until after you watch it a few times and even then it has little effect on the way you view the film. Due to this, there's also no mention of a nuclear family which would really be pathetic in a setting like the ice age.<br/><br/>All in all, Ice Age is a great movie and is proof on how much effort was put into 3d animations before Shrek 2 and The Incredibles came out."

","Ice Age is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific voice cast. It's certainly a very original animated film, focusing around a group of animals as the ice age begins, it's quite funny and the characters are very likable, it also has a lot of heart and the ending of the film is very sweet, I also really loved Scrat's scenes, being my favourite parts of the entire franchise. It's a fun movie, but it's definitely much more entertaining for kids, I loved it when it first came out, I probably would have rated it ten back then, but now I'm giving it a seven as it just dosen't hold up as well when you're older, it dosen't have enough humour for adults to laugh, something that is evident in all the best animated films, such as Monsters Inc and Shrek, it's understandable that it wanted kids to be its target audiences but there should have been more in it for an older viewer. The ending is very anti-climatic, as the story finishes, we are left feeling there should have been more, it definitely could have been at least ten minutes longer, to give us a better idea where the characters were headed, how their relationship has changed over the course of this movie and give them more closure with the child. It's certainly not the finest animated film, but Ice Age is still sure to entertain and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>As the ice age begins, three animals discover a lost human infant, they must travel far and wide to find his tribe."

It felt like the animators were so lazy they forgot to make it more realistic looking as the backgrounds look so generic its like what you see in a Barbie movie or a made for TV or straight to DVD animated film with the quality of the film. Maybe its only my opinion on it but it didn't seem as realistic as let's say Big Hero 6 or Tangled which had more realistic backgrounds than this but I guess the two I have mentioned are from Disney,while this is 20th Century Fox.<br/><br/>Overall thought if you love Shrek,you will like this film.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Ice Age was a completely original story when it first came out, and in this last generation it is hard to be original in the film industry. <br/><br/>Ice Age is about three prehistoric creatures forming an unlikely friendship over something unexpected. Manny the Mammoth believes himself to be the last mammoth alive (having watched his wife and child lose their lives to the savage human tribes that kill for meat and fur to stay alive) and unwillingly befriends an idiotic sloth named Sid. A group of saber tooth tigers seek revenge on the human tribes for attacking their pack and the leader tells Diego to kill a woman and her baby, and asks that he bring the baby to him alive. The woman flees into a river with the baby, and having washed onto a rock, sees Manny and Sid watching her. She slides the baby before them and disappears into the river. Manny and Sid set out to return the baby to the tribe, and run into Diego who pretends to befriend them in order to steal the baby at the right time.

","When a group of sabre-toothed cats led by Soto (Goran Visnjic) attack a group of humans that have been hunting their pack, a mother of a new- born baby escapes, inadvertently leaving the baby with the giant mammoth Manny (Ray Romano) and his clumsy, clueless tag-a-long friend Sid (John Leguizamo), a sloth. Soto puts his lieutenant Diego (Denis Leary) in charge of finding the baby and bringing it back to him alive, so Diego befriends Manny and Sid, who are returning the baby to the humans, in an attempt to mislead them into the path of Soto and his savage pack. But they have treacherous caves and a group of idiotic dodo's in their path, amongst other things.<br/><br/>With a relatively microscopic budget (of around $60 million) in terms of modern funding, 20th Century Fox have managed to create a lovely-looking (although it suffers in comparison to the likes of WALL-E (2008)) piece of animation with a host of talented voice actors. Of course, due to its massive popularity, the Ice Age films have now produced three sequels, a Christmas special, and a rather impressive profit. I was interested to see why this was so popular, given the massive amount of CGI animated films being churned out these days that are of mainly poor quality. Although the film isn't exactly a classic, the well realised characters (and the voices behind them) and its genuine heart raises it above the rest.<br/><br/>This kind of story has been done before, for instance it was bettered in Pixar's Monsters, Inc. (2001) that came out a year before, and although it would be harsh to call the film unoriginal, Ice Age does suffer somewhat because of this. But whoever's idea it was to cast Hollywood misfit John Leguizamo as the idiotic Sid deserves a firm pat on the back. He is the comic relief to the film, and if mishandled could have come across as annoying, yet Leguizamo's voice (coming across as Louis Spence crossed with Mort from Family Guy) and some impressive facial capturing makes him a very funny and endearing character. And every time the story seems to be heading into predictable territory (which is does often), a clever running joke involving Scrat, a sabre-toothed squirrel, trying to smuggle an acorn to be frequently interrupted, makes the film fun again. Hardly anything breakthrough, but there's much fun to be had and I will be watching the sequels.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"Hey_Sweden","8","0","0","1 July 2012"," Completely endearing.
","The Looney Tunes spirit is kept alive and well in this likable computer animated feature, that also continues the tradition started by ""Toy Story"" in having humour for younger and older viewers. It's also got real heart and soul, and characters that are never less than entertaining. It can often bring a lump to ones' throat, just as much as it elicits chuckles with its one liners and visual gags. Set during the title time in Earths' history, it brings together three very unlikely comrades - a solitary mammoth named Manfred (voice of Ray Romano), a goof ball sloth named Sid (voice of John Leguizamo), and a sabre toothed tiger named Diego (voice of Denis Leary). Their mission is to return a human baby to its tribe, although Diegos' motive has nothing to do with wanting to do the ""right"" thing. Punctuated by the misadventures of a prehistoric squirrel named Scrat (voice of director Chris Wedge), just as terminally unlucky as Wile E. Coyote himself, ""Ice Age"" is hard to resist, right from start to finish. The characters are wittily and inventively realized visually, especially Sid, the kind of character who can be seen as annoying but who is also very likable in his way. Leguizamo is a standout in this role, getting most of the big laughs. Other talents providing voices are Goran Visnjic as Soto, and Jack Black as Zeke, as well as Cedric the Entertainer, Stephen Root, Diedrich Bader, Alan Tudyk, and Jane Krakowski. Some scenes of peril may indeed be too much for the very young to take, but for others there is a deliciously dark edge to some of the humour, especially in regards to the dodo birds. There's also a very nice message in here about looking out for others, as well as one about redemption. All in all, a fine family feature, one that charms and amuses for a well paced 81 minutes. Eight out of 10."

I won't get into details, but all the things you'd expect in a movie like this is there. There's even a sub- plot with a squirrel thing that has it's own funny comedic plot going, and it at times affects the main movie (especially in the sequels)<br/><br/>Anyway the movie was pretty good, and thus I'll rate it 7/10."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","0","17 September 2011"," In spite of the title, this is very much a warm film; whether it's one for the ages is another matter, but it's affirming and exciting enough to recommend.
","Ice Age is a three way buddy pic set in the pre-prehistoric era unfolding as a modern day road movie of sorts, in spite of taking place at a time many millennia before roads would even exist; a neat comedy driven by the rocky relationships between a trio of hapless creatures of ancient times gone by running on some good interplay and wily writing as we observe them negate a long, relatively hostile, terrain rife with the elements; sight gags and the fleeting pop culture reference. The film, a sort of two way riff on the likes of Shrek and Monter's Inc., is a workable and often exciting excursion into animation; made more impacting by the real lack of this era in planet Earth's long existence ever really being put to screen, particularly in the animated format. Where Ice Age is nothing above and beyond, it is quaint and timely; its attitude to what it essentially represents never more than evident during a more-dramatic-than-we-expect denouement, something which sees directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha exude an offbeat idea that primitive humans and plentiful mammals may actually co-exist peacefully in this unremitting world of food-chains and strife Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is somewhat nonsensical, and more than fanciful, but you've oddly swayed with it. <br/><br/>The film begins with a short skit, within which we observe a small squirrel-like character speaking to us in agonised squeaks and offering us pained reactions to his pratfalls. His unfortunate exploits linked to never quite knowing what to do with a small nut he's managed to get his hands on are what follows, with an attempted burying of it in the snow causing a huge rift in the ground, a rift formulating into a crack and then causing a huge glazier to break off seemingly dooming all the creatures within the realms of this world. Those of whom it will affect the most dwell in the valleys and the forests below this mountainous locale; here, a large but seemingly downcast mammoth named Manfred (Romano) is, in a literal sense, heading counter to the tide as he walks against the mass exodus of animals fleeing this glacier rift and looming ice age. It isn't long until he bumps into Sid, or rather Sid bumps into him; a character who has to be one of the more talkative sloths ever devised and of whom is voiced by John Leguizamo - Sid's scenario seeing him left behind by that of his close family prior to disembarkment: for reasons that become clearer. The dynamic of Sid and Manfred's relationship feeds off the animated film of 2001 of equally good value in Shrek; specifically, Eddie Murphy's Donkey character literally running into that of the hulking titular lead following a mix up with those out to get at him: the nature of their later bond a clear riff on the said pairing in their ""little-and-large"" double act plus easily wound up nature clashing with the smaller element of the pairing's talkative nature. <br/><br/>Away from these proceedings lie a pack of sabre tooth tigers led by that of Soto (Visnjic), who employs the services of one of his more competent aides, Diego (Leary), to swipe an infant from a camp of early-human Neanderthals amidst the chaos of a surprise attack; early-human Neanderthals of whom look suspiciously drawn from 1995's Pocahontas and its respective homo-sapiens. Soto has preordained this attack out of spite for the mass slaughters implemented upon the tiger clan that have transpired at the discretion of the Neanderthals. The tigers, with their predominantly Hispanic sounding Christian names and evident subscription to gang culture, allude to a greater extent of misrepresentation, but a misrepresentation of which isn't prominent enough to sag the film into a messy trough of any kind. Indeed, Soto puts it very clearly to the rest of us that it is a guided idea born out of a desire for retribution; a veering of the characters away from stock villainy sort and perhaps doing well to draw the more younger members of the targeted audience into identifying the politics of the two sides before having them take their own stance. <br/><br/>The raid is a success but Diego looses the baby down a nearby river, only for it to end up in the laps of Manfred and Sid further on down the stretch of water; Diego's angling for it back clashing with Manfred's ignorance out of Diego's true intent as he strives to return it to the humans. Principally, the duality in Manfred and Diego's attitudes towards the primitive humans in regards to specific tragedies that have come to affect either their lives or existences is what's at the forefront here; later revelations linked to Manfred reveal certain truths that do not do enough to sway him onto the ill-guided tract of blood-lust and destruction that drove Diego pre-crucible. What unfolds is an often exciting, albeit reasonably routine, adventure film about these grossly differing animals connecting and repelling at various stages, with a neat framework concluding with quaint epiphanies we do not necessarily have much of a problem with no matter how channelled they may be. The film has fun with that post modern approach to animation contemporary American animations usually feed off, a tract reading something along the lines of ""real life in a world not entirely true to life""; the stopping for a mock-level crossing occurring shortly after we're made aware of the trio's travelling ought to resemble a holidaying family separate examples of this. We enjoy the film's sense of adventure, its grandiose feel in spite of it being a little over 80-odd minutes in length, as well as its core politic pitched solely towards its target demographic that teamwork persistently wins out in the end, and that when prejudices and such are put aside, things can more often than not come off for the much better."

","Ice Age is just one a slew of computer generated films aimed for young children and families that came out in the early 2000s. It centers around three friends; a woolly mammoth named Manny who is voiced by Ray Romano, a saber-toothed tiger called Diego who is voiced by Denis Leary, and a smooth-talking, dimwitted sloth named Sid, who is voiced by John Leguizamo. Together the three friends face the destruction of their home by impending glaciers brought on by a coming ice age, all the while trying to return a human baby back to his village.<br/><br/>As with most family friendly movies, this one centers around friendship, trust and togetherness as the three reluctant friends face many hardships such as lava pits, glaciers, and ice caverns all to accomplish their goal. <br/><br/>Though this film is solid, it doesn't rank with the powerhouses of family films such as Shrek, mostly because of the pacing and lack of thrill. The movie is funny, but not because of the usually reasons, such as the characters finding themselves in zany predicaments, but rather the characters themselves add to the majority of the humor. Manny, the mammoth is boorish and slow, Diego is slick and somewhat devilish, while Sid is fast talking but not fast thinking. The character combination is what makes the film generally enjoyable. However, the most enjoyable character is one that does not get equal billing with the others, and that is Scrat. Scrat is a saber-toothed squirrel, who wants nothing more than to secure his fortune that comes in the form of an elusive acorn. Throughout the film the camera will cut to Scrat chasing the acorn and finding himself in some hilarious situations. Yes, the bulk of the comedy focuses mainly on Scrat, and most adults would find his scenes more entertaining than watching the rest of the animals on their adventure. <br/><br/>This is most likely because the pacing is as slow as Manny lumbering up a hill. As you watch the movie, you find it obvious that the pacing is set more for children than adults, which is okay, except that there are some rather scary scenes in which most young children shouldn't watch it alone without adults their to reassure them.<br/><br/>As far as the artistic styling of the film, the lighting, and camera angles, and colors are all brilliant and vibrant throughout the film, and they tie in well with the overall attitude of the movie being of a light and airy sort. The theme does well to show kids that friendships can be made and challenges overcome with teamwork. For the most part, Ice Age is a solid family movie most intended for children 6 and up."

","The computer-animated epic ""Ice Age"" musters cross-generational appeal--adolescents as well as adults--with its ""Looney Tunes"" like tale about a woolly mammoth, Manfred (Ray Romano), a dim-witted sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo of ""The Pest""), and a sagacious saber-toothed tiger, Diego (Denis Leary of ""The Amazing Spiderman"") and their exploits 20,000 years ago when glaciers moved and wildlife migrated. Director Chris Wedge and co-director Carlos Saldanha get things off to a hilarious start with a woebegone little character named ""Scrat"" as it chases an acorn without being crushed by a glacier. The desperate efforts by the varmint to save the acorn while not being killed by the ice makes this opening gambit wonderfully funny. Basically, this is a road trip comedy with an odd couple. The story unfolds rather dramatically with a pack of saber-tooth tigers plotting to wipe out a village of prehistoric humans so that they can get the morsel of a baby. Later, the helpless Sid has to elude a couple of pugnacious rhinos and Manfred intervenes to save his life from the rhinos. The saber-tooth tigers attack the village. During the battle, the mother seizes her baby and flees. Diego corners her on a high rock above a water fall and she plunges into the rapidly flowing water to save her child. Downriver she manages to get the baby safely put on land while Manfred and Sid watch. The next time that we see them, Sid observes that the mother is 'gone.' ""Ice Age"" turns into three critters and a baby. The baby grows up enough to learn how to watch. Other amusing gags include our heroes stumbling upon a tribe of dodo birds that contribute more to their own extinction by stupidity than the dangers that they face. Diego joins up with Manfred and Sid but he does so because the saber-tooth tiger leader wants him to deliver the baby alive or suffer dire consequences. We learn later on from a cave painting what may have happened to Manfred's family. ""Ice Age"" packs several surprises, and sensitive adults will shed tears at Diego's untimely demise. Sid and the acorn-chasing Scrat steal the show. The animation is particularly good, too. The end gambit with a frozen Scrat washing ashore on an island is a rib-tickling hoot."

","Ice age isn't a great movie. If you think about some of the other animated achievements in the past(Toy story, Up, Ratatouille). All beautiful films.Ice age doesn't compare to those, but it's a fun film.<br/><br/>Ice age is a film that takes place, well, obviously, in the Ice age. It revolves around three characters. A Whooly mammoth named Manny(voiced by Ray Ramono), a sloth or something named Sid(voiced by John Leguizamo), and a Sabertooth named... well, I can't remember right now.(voiced by the great Dennis Leary).They begin a search when an Indian tribe is attacked and they find an infant. <br/><br/>They don't know whether to trust the saber tooth. Because he might have attacked the tribe(which he kind of did). The three animals try to take the infant home on a very fun journey. A journey that some may forget.<br/><br/>Ice age is entertaining no doubt about it. But saying that it is art and a masterpiece is pushing it. Really pushing it. Luckily, I don't know anybody who has. Ice age is a fun movie. And the only good one in the trilogy. Yes, I am sad to admit that it is the only good Ice age film. The others just got extinct after a while. This one... that won't happen.<br/><br/>Ice age:***/****"
"TheUnknown837-1","8","0","0","9 November 2009"," the plot treads on familiar ground, but ""Ice Age"" succeeds because of an arsenal of funny moments, charming characters, and some surprisingly strong and beautiful moments
","As far as plot is concerned, there is nothing particularly spectacular about ""Ice Age"" because Manny the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the saber-tooth are treading over the same ground that movies such as ""Shrek"" did shortly before. However, that does not disqualify it from being an enjoyable movie. By contrast, this is a very sweet, funny, and wonderfully charming little movie that I actually prefer over ""Shrek."" Yes, ""Shrek"" is a better movie, but I personally prefer ""Ice Age.""<br/><br/>Like ""Shrek"", the movie concerns a grumpy hermit, an irritating sidekick, and an unwanted burden all joined together on a quest. Only this time, the hermit is a moody mammoth named Manny (voice by Ray Romano), the sidekick is a rejected sloth named Sid (voice by John Leguizamo) and the unwanted burden is a human child whose been separated from his clan following an attack by a pack of saber-toothed tigers. One of the tigers, a cunning feline named Diego (Denis Leary) has also joined the quest to return the child to his clan. And as they travel, there's a rat-like squirrel known only as Scrat, darting around, obsessed with protecting his acorn against everything from nosey sloths to avalanches.<br/><br/>The reason why ""Ice Age"" holds up despite an all-too-familiar plot is because it boasts surprisingly funny jokes, well-realized characters, a decent enough story, and much to my delight, a potent level of charm. The movie is not all light-noted funny moments. There are some surprisingly moving moments in the movie, including one that succeeded in bringing tears to my eyes. And that's the primary reason why I like this movie so much. It makes me laugh, but also warms my heart. Yet it does not overplay the dramatic hand to the point where it becomes mopey or too depressing for younger children.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Ice Age"" is a very well-realized family entertainment movie. It's not a jaw-dropping spectacle or a revolutionary film, but it is influential, very funny, charming, and it can pull at your heart strings. And that nutty little squirrel Scrat, he never fails at producing a grin."

So today I decided to watch again Ice Age and it wasn't the same, it wasn't like in 2002. And I wasn't a very little kid back in 2002 but still 7 years are 7 years and certainly I remembered a much better movie, I remembered a much funnier squirrel but now I can say this isn't even better than Dawn of the Dinosaurs, of course this doesn't looks as good as ""Dinosaurs"" (still it is a good-looking movie) and well this is just an OK movie, entertaining at least.<br/><br/>It's very simple, simple elements: three different animals, a mammoth, a sloth and a saber tooth tiger, will have a common goal which is returning a lost baby to his people. The saber tooth tiger while at first with a different goal will end being good, you know it is basic. The squirrel works a bit better here than in ""Dinosaurs"", it feels that it is a bit more stick with the main story. But still apart of that scene when the main characters ask it about the humans and of its very last expression (that happens 20, 000 years later of the events in the movie) the squirrel is never hilarious.<br/><br/>So, yesterday I was thinking ""the first one was much better than its sequels"" but now I'm not, this is far from being a great."

","My Take: Nowhere near SHREK on the level of craftsmanship, but amusing and energetic enough. <br/><br/>ICE AGE may not be a much for SHREK nor TOY STORY 2, but with fine characters, an appealing (of somewhat familiar) story and terrific animation (fur has never been this accurate), ICE AGE earns its place in the animation milestone. A trio of Pleistocene critters including Manny the moody Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), a talkative sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) and a shady sabertooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) come together when they come across a baby Neanderthal whom they plan to bring back to his tribe. While on the other hand, Diego's pack of hungry sabers, led by its vengeful leader (Goran Visnjic), look on the little human as a snack (while also looking at the mammoth as a little bonus).<br/><br/>There's really not much of a story, partly being the main plot itself has already been done on MONSTER'S INC., released almost the same time as this film. Basically, it's just an environment-hopping adventure moving from one place to another, encountering critter (a pair of grumpy rhinos) to critter (a flock of dimwitted dodos who plan the biggest hibernation of their lives, with a stock of only three melons). The animation is fairly well, with the computerized fur almost nearing its perfection. The comedy is surprisingly sharp, with great help from the always reliable Ray Romano on the helm. ICE AGE is yet to be on the level of SHREK or other competitions, but it's a fine start for (hopefully) great things to come. <br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

I can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office. Apparently, a lot of people liked this movie. A gorgeous color palette (man, this DVD looks incredible on a flat screen TV set) and a lot of good adult (but clean) humor make this a big winner. The opening 3-4-minute scene with ""Scat,"" is excellent as are subsequent interludes with him. ""Sid"" the sloth (voiced by John Leguizano), however, provides the main humor in the movie. He usually has something funny to say throughout the movie. Ray Romano is the voice of the mammoth, the big character of the film, literally, while Denis Leary is the ferocious bad-guy-turned-good sabertooth tiger. This isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice, sentimental story of how a little baby softens up a couple of tough characters.

You don't have to be sad, tedious and formal to make people's consciences change. I'm sure you will be pleased and will laugh out loud, but in some times one tear will appear in your eye and you've been moved by a lot of scenes. On the other hand, I won't recommend the same way Ice Age 2. Yes, it's very funny to see that rare animal pursuing its acorn, but I think it's tiring. It has some good things like love for family and also a full charge of friendship. Second part is not bad. First part is fantastic. I remember a lot of good cartoon series in the 70's and the 80's (say Heidi, Maya...) and some good films from Disney's Factory. It's a pleasure to see that the spirit of such productions is in this 21st Century Movie. One of the best of its genre. I strongly recommend a purchase. Put it to your kids and make them laugh.

The film introduces the principals in a series of actions that demonstrate some favorable personality traits while revealing they have weakness too. As the story progresses, we get to know these creatures through their interaction as they slowly learn to trust and even like one another.<br/><br/>The construct of the movie is a quest. A wooly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a sloth join forces to return a baby human to its people, after a tragedy the child survives. The mammoth was my favorite, a heroic and gentle giant who made the silent pact with a dying human to save the child. He has nothing to gain personally for doing this; it's just the right thing to do. The sloth makes a great comic relief sidekick, and the tiger Diego is a deceptively complex character that is developed well. The running gag with the little guy trying to capture a nut that is seemingly always just out of his reach works well and seems to fit anywhere they choose to put it.<br/><br/>The characters grow in ways which are surprising during the first viewing, but the logic in how they change ultimately makes sense. The film tells a wonderful story, and some moments, like the petroglyph imagery are quite touching. The expressions on the faces of the characters are magnificently done; no words need be said. The wild ice slide ride (with its ingenious sight gags) are the other side of the picture, just some entertaining silliness for its own sake.<br/><br/>The movie involves you with the characters, as you join them on their journey.

","I first saw this film in a cinema when it was first released, and it is now one of my personal favourites. Even now, 5 years later, it still manages to make me laugh. I can't really choose just one aspect of the film that makes it so brilliant, but I definitely think that the cast has something to do with it. <br/><br/>Ray Romano is a great choice for Manny; he can be moody and sullen at times, but we also get an insight into why he is like that; he is hiding his pain. Dennis Leary is brilliant as Diego; you're never quite sure where you stand with his character until the very end. Sid the sloth has got to be the funniest character in the film (aside from Scrat possibly); without him, the other characters would have no one to direct their sarcastic comments at, and there would be a lot less comic relief. John Leguizamo is amazing; the voice he gives Sid is so distinct and funny that it makes me laugh every time. He gives a charm to the character; even though he may well be one of the ugliest things you've ever seen, you warm to his kindness and loyalty to his friends. Sometimes when watching a film, there are parts that really seem to drag; fortunately, I did not find any such moments in this film. <br/><br/>Possibly the best scene ever has got to be the one with the dodos. Granted, the way they died was dissimilar to the truth (we were the ones who hunted them to extinction) but the slow-mo scene with Sid and the melon was absolutely hilarious: Dodos flying everywhere and Sid leaping over their heads. I was in stitches. Backgrounds are a little plain and not realistic, but hey, this is a cartoon, not a super-realistic blockbuster. <br/><br/>As I have mentioned before, the voices are perfect for their characters, and they give a little bit of themselves to the role.

See? It's already sweet.<br/><br/>And it just gets cuter and sweeter, more zany, and absolutely FUN from there on out. There are some tense moments, so parents may wish to prescreen before allowing younger children to view it.<br/><br/>This was easily the best animation of 2007, and is still highly enjoyable today.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","Ice Age is a great film, I have watched it for three times. It is an interesting and funny movie too! I think it is the best animation the world has ever had before.<br/><br/>In the movie, the baby learned to walk and eat. She became friend of Diego- a tiger.This was really educative. I love the Dodo birds most, they protected their watermelons with their life. In the end, Diego changed his mind of saving the baby from other tigers instead of eating her. That showed justice, Diego was noble. Mannfred the Mammoth had saved Diego's life. That was the main factor that changed Diego's mind. They argued at the first but became good friends at the end.<br/><br/>Ice Age is really too short, and I wished it would be longer. But the content is good.That's all I want to say. Hope everyone like this movie!"

","This film is one of those in the world of animated movies that just says to folks ""Hey, not all of the great computer animated films out there come from Disney and Dreamworks alone!"" It is simple and yet it is none too shabby either. The story starts off with an unsuspecting little ""Scrat"" (saber-toothed squirrel) trying to store his acorn for the winter, and as he does, is soon in the midst of a great migration of all prehistoric mammals, great and small. Among these creatures a lone mammoth named Manny is shown trying to leave all of the others behind, and soon meeting an oafish ground sloth named Sid. The two travel and soon Sid, who had found a baby human, made a move to try to return this baby to his tribe. Manny, not seeming to care a whit for Sid but having an altruistic attitude, teamed up with him and the two made their way to meet up with a saber-toothed cat known as Diego, who was employed in the finding of the humans, claiming that he could find them. And so through many hardships and goofy antics, the trio now make their way to try and return the baby to his family. With some touching moments showed in this fine little film and some hilarious cartoon-like antics, it is not to be missed by cartoon film patrons in the know."

","I was thoroughly pleased after watching Ice Age. Every moment of the movie was enjoyable me, and is for people of all ages, from infants to geriatrics. This visually animated film is about a hilarious journey of a few unlikely friends. As animals of all species start their journey to run from the oncoming Ice Age, a few of them get separated from their families and join together to overcome this feat and survive. A mammoth, sloth, and saber-toothed tiger join together to migrate south. Along the way they even rescue a human baby while overcoming their differences with each other.

","It was hard not to compare this movie to others like Monsters Inc. or Shrek, which were also great animated films. I really like the computer animated movies like these. This film is just fun enough and enjoyable enough to rank itself up with the other two. While this film may not be as original, actually seeming to blend the plots of Monsters and Shrek, it doesn't matter due to the lovable character personalities and intriguing scenery. It didn't seem to matter too much that the relationship between Manny and Sid was much like Shrek and the donkey, or that two odd characters are stuck with a human baby, with the larger hairy one eventually warming up to it. Mixing the two plots, tossing the setting back into prehistoric times and using that as a basis for a lot of its humor, works very well here. And the film has heart. While it does seem a little corny at times, the heart is there, and it's always great to see a warm movie like this."

","Equally balanced computer animated children's adventure carefully measures comedic, dramatic, and action elements to make the movie fly by for all ages. Ice Age shares most ingredients that make any successful animation work- diverse characters of opposite emotions, fast-paced and beautifully rendered visual design, heartfelt morality, and staggering zaniness (let us not forget the unsung hero of this franchise, the squirrel in his eternal quest to enjoy a little acorn).

"coolfasho-1","9","0","0","11 September 2006"," A Truly exceptional animation
","Here we have a a phenomenal animated cinematic production. The financial investment it must have taken to establish such a highly-defined animated film must have been considerably extensive, but as any typical viewer can perceive, including myself, the effort has truly paid off. The voluminous and solemn Manfred (Ray Romano) accompanied by the burdensome yet substantially droll Sid (John Leguizamo) make an interesting duo as they embark upon an adventure to return a child to his widower father. Even Denis Leary's voice acting of Siego applies an interesting vocal sound which fluctuates in between the prosaic dialogue of Manfred and the high pitched monotony of Sid.<br/><br/>The augmentation of the plot outline by the periodic intervention of the hilarious small furry creature (dubbed Scrat) is ingenious. His dogged efforts to conceal his acorn from a foreboding ice age apocalypse results in constant precarious changes in the icy environment. Throughout viewing this singular and witty animated accomplishment I couldn't resist bursting into peals of laughter and calling my friend over to watch it a second time. From beginning to end, the explicit plot is gripping, the voice acting is strikingly humorous, and that inner desire one possesses to view an extraordinary film a second, a third, or even fourth time resounds. In my ranks this intriguing picture deserves a 9/10"
"Stampsfightclub","8","0","0","1 September 2006"," A definite watch for the whole family
","When watching family animation I always like to have a good laugh and appreciate the sentimental and humorous ideologies as well as the fantastic graphics and this 2002 hit is one if not my favourite animation.<br/><br/>This story sees a sloth; a mammoth and a sabre-toothed tiger form an unlikely friendship as they travel through the icy climate looking for humans to return the stranded baby.<br/><br/>The story is slow moving. This way we can accept the different ideas put forth and gain the persona's of the characters. Its emotional, funny, and appreciative of the family comedy drama genre.<br/><br/>The side story about the Scrat the squirrel is great and adds a different aspect to the animation genre. It's a little story about one squirrel and his nut and the physical humour is great.<br/><br/>Having different animals the audience can gain an insight into different views, opinions on life. It's an unlikely combination and that's what makes the whole film exciting, because we don't know how they're going to deal with each other.<br/><br/>The film is very humorous, it prides itself on physical humour although it does have some great speech humour between characters. Having humour was great but a real reason why I loved this film is because it is emotionally driven as well. The film sells ideologies of loyalty, friendship, families and survival making it a real aspect of real life. It preaches through the likable characters and therefore younger children will appreciate the ideas and realise how important they are in real life, because they will admire the characters and want to understand about life. Having humour combined with emotion allows audiences to accept the characters who are portrayed in a 'real' light.<br/><br/>My favourite scene involved the three animals trying to rescue a watermelon from a group of dodos who are tripping over themselves, literally. It is hilarious and younger audiences as well as an older one can appreciate the hilarity behind the great physical humour.<br/><br/>The CGI used is simply outstanding. It is used very effectively to gain the aspects of the characters. The funny expressions of the squirrel, the stupidity of the sloth, the greatness of the mammoth and he scenery is also outstanding, especially in the ice cavern towards the end.<br/><br/>It's a different animation to what you normally see. Because of the high amount of loyalty emotional situations it is very different to your other animation films such as 'Toy Story 2' which should have been emotional but was comedy driven, and therefore adds something different.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend it to anyone. It's a great film to watch with the family. You will laugh and you will cry when watching 'Ice Age' an enjoyable comedy/drama with a great energetic storyline"

I have to admit that before I bought the DVD I had some doubts because when I was a little child I saw Walt Disney or Warner Bros cartoon and not CGI generated films.

He puts his trust in Deigo and Sid and when he almost died when the ice bridge collapsed trying to save Diego I lost it. When Diego asked Manny why he did it he simply said because that's what friends do. I think the story line really shows what we as humans should be like.

"nycritic","9","0","0","3 April 2006"," The Quest to Return a Lost Child
","I have a soft spot for animated movies because even the lesser effective ones (HOODWINKED) have their own magic even when either their very story, overall composition, or continuity may bog it down. And due to the fact that they're aimed at the younger audience, it's become a staple that these films -- deemed ""safe"" -- have a simple plot allegorical in nature with clearly defined characters, comic interludes, a frightful chase sequence involving the main character(s), and a character that either switches sides from bad to good or from weak to strong which comes in at the crucial climactic, dramatic moment where a resolution is needed. It goes back to the days of Disney and BAMBI.<br/><br/>ICE AGE is no different. It follows these elements closely in the story of Manfred the woolly mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego, a saber-toothed tiger, who due to circumstances not of their own making come together to return a child back to its parents. Throughout the way they will come closer even though the tiger may not have clear intentions with the child, and there is a truly beautiful scene when Manfred comes upon some cave drawings made by humans in which he sees the tragic story of his own breed. We see it too -- from Manfred's point of view. Both we and Manfred react the same way: with a sad feeling of irony.<br/><br/>A very good movie that may appeal to young and old, ICE AGE benefits from the vocal personalities of its cast: Ray Romano brings likability to Manfred, John Leguizamo is great as the goofy Sid, and most of all Denis Leary, with his gravelly low menace of a voice, does a sharp turn as the conflicted, dangerous Diego. A cute story adds a little padding to the movie and exists in its own universe: a little squirrel trying to get his nut -- watch the end credits, which intended or not, sort of foreshadow the title of its sequel."

","Ice Age is a very funny film. The story revolves around three different animals during the migration because of an Ice Age, who find a baby human and begin a quest to reunite the baby with his tribe. An interesting take on the John Wayne film ""3 Godfathers"", which revolved around three outlaws who find a dying woman that gives birth to a baby and requests the men take the baby back to town to give the baby a chance at life. Similar indeed. The difference is that ""3 Godfathers"" was more a drama and ""Ice Age"" is a family comedy. I'd recommend watching both films, then compare and contrast the two of them.

"Syrchek","8","0","0","20 September 2005"," Great fun. Presumably the funniest animated film I've seen so far.
","Ice Age is a movie that really focuses on it's characters. I found the way the characters look, move and sound very funny and amazing. It wouldn't be fair to say that they just had some life in them like I did for Madagascar. At times I was so sunk in that I forgot that I was watching invented creatures because they appeared so authentic.<br/><br/>I won't give away the story, all I can say is that it's pretty classical but still very worth watching and portraying on the big screen. There's also a pile of fun and imaginative creatures in the movie. But most of all the creators gave great significance to fun and adventure.<br/><br/>Surprisingly there's just a handful of movie references which I didn't mind at all. One of the few things I didn't find very good was the action that went a bit overboard at times. Overall this is a very fun animated feature. I'm still quite new in seeing these sort of movies but this one was perhaps the best I've seen so far.<br/><br/>........ 4/5 ........"

","Filled with clichÃ©s of all cartoons this one still has enough to overcome its mediocre story. The cast has a blast with the characters who are all well thought out. The characters with great voices are the highlight here. It looks great and can be fun if you let it. It is an obvious attempt to cash in on the success of the pixar movies but fails to get the magic of those wonderful films. The writing is only half what those movies are although the look and cast seems top notch. It is certainly one that can be enjoyed by kids although adults might have a hard time sitting through it as they've seen the same basics done a million times over since they were kids."
"ccm043","8","0","0","19 May 2005"," Very Funny Movie. A lot better than ""Robots""
","This is an extremely funny movie. Although some of it seems stolen from other movies, it manages to pull off a difficult job: making a believable world that is consistently funny throughout. Undeniably, the best part is Scrat (or is it Scrap). Whenever he's on screen, I can't help to bust out laughing. Too bad he's not part of the main story. The main characters include a mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), Sid the sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego the saber tooth tiger (Dennis Leary; apparently, they didn't think alliteration was appropriate for this character). All in all, these characters manage to get some good laughs (although they pale in comparison with Scrat). Sid can sometimes get annoying, but overall the three main characters aren't bad.<br/><br/>There are plenty of good scenes, including a fight with a group of apocalyptic dodos, an amusing trip in an ice cave, and a final scene with Diego's pack. Some parts of the movie feel stolen from other movies. The pack feels like something from ""The Lion King"" and the baby seems like it was lifted out of ""Monsters Inc."" Furthermore, although I'm not complaining about the voice talents, I wish they would do what Pixar does, and mine the creative depths of the staff as opposed to just going to large scale celebrities for voices.<br/><br/>Still, this was an excellent animated film. I would recommend this over ""Robots"" any day."

","The computer animation revolution took off after Shrek broke box office records in 2001, prompting all studios to produce their own pop culture rich computer animated features of their own. The first Fox Studios entry was this one, Ice Age, a funny movie following Manfred the Mammouth (Ray Romano) and Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo) as they go the wrong way during the seasonal migration. Manfred has always been an outcast in this chilly society, and Sid just annoys everyone to the point that he's out there by himself as well. The plot takes off when Manfred and Sid find a baby human after saber-tooth tigers attack an early man settlement. Manfred and Sid decide to take the baby back to the humans. One problem is that one of the attacking saber-tooths, Diego (Denis Leary), travels with them, his motivations unclear. The movie follows the traveling party in mainly good cheer and with outstanding animation. The scene where the party slides through an ice shield is especially effective. Ice Age is a good movie that has funny moments, lead mostly through the comedic chemistry that exists between Romana, Leguizamo, and Leary. However, when compared to the Shrek movies, the overall laugh-out-loud humor just does not measure up. However, that is not to say Ice Age is a bad movie, it's just not as good as the contemporary gold standards. The animation, however, is top notch, even the humans, though have their own style, look good enough to do well. Ice Age is quality entertainment, just not to the level of Shrek."

","The Ice Age, a time in the earths history that brought many, many years of cold temperatures, death, lack of food... and a reason to make an animated classic that I have bought, watched and loved. <br/><br/>Scrat, undeniably, makes this movie what it is. There is no way that anyone can tell me differant. If it wasn't for his comic little pieces through the film, I would have lost interest and probably switched off. If you are a serious Scrat lover like I am, You have got to get this DVD as there is a special short-movie all about Scrat!<br/><br/>Everyone should regress back to the animation genre at least once a week.

","Above all Ice Age is a marvel of computer generated animation. The rendering of the bleak ice and snow is truly impressive, too bad the story doesn't hold up as well. The best bit of business is a running gag with a small cartoony animal trying desperately to store an acorn in his desolate glacial environment. The rest of the film seems to be trying too hard to capture the zany fun of Shrek, or the spark of  Monster's, Inc, but lacklustre writing and predictable situations cast a chill over the whole thing. John Leguizamo's voicing of Sid the Sloth is very good, although Ray Romano as Manfred the Mammoth is a monotone bore."

","I wouldn't go so far as to not recommend this movie, since the only problems I have with it are due to an overexposure to the plot devices used in the movie - the sort of things common to every kids movie ever made it seems. That doesn't make it bad, just not something I'd go far.<br/><br/>It is a little saccharine, so I might say that for the most part anyone looking for something with a little more wit could be disappointed in an obviously for-kids movie like this.<br/><br/>However, all of that goes out the window when that squirrel (the one in all the trailers) comes on-screen. His time is limited, but it seems apparent that the decision makers had the wisdom to tell these guys 'hey, could you stick in a little more squirrel?' every time it's getting intolerably dull. That doesn't save the movie, but you can leave saying 'at least there was one aspect where I couldn't stop laughing.'<br/><br/>And of course, visually it won't disappoint, but that's almost a given with Pixar flicks. Of all of their stuff, I'd put this at the bottom...but that isn't in itself bad."

","This is my first CG animated film that I've ever seen. Usually, the look of other animated films made me reticent to see them. Not Ice Age. I wanted to see it the moment I saw the trailer with Scrat, the hilarious sabertooth squirrel.<br/><br/>Ice Age was sporadically funny and overall fun film to watch. The story is basically an animated version of Three Men and a Baby, set 20,000 years in the past. The visuals were great. Simply beautiful. It's one thing to create convincing aninmation, it's another thing altogether to create visually arresting stuff and Ice Age is great to look at with its stylized visuals.

","My family and I rented this movie last night and we thought it was so cute and funny. The squirrel-rat (Scrat) cracked me up while he chased his acorn. I liked all the characters but out of Manfred the Mammoth, Sid the Sloth, and Diego the Saber-Toothed Tiger I favored Sid the best. I loved the way he talked! It was so funny and I just had to laugh every time I heard him say his s's. The baby was really cute. It just had a cute face and was just so adorable. I also liked the fact that Diego started out as a bad guy and just wanted the baby and to eat Manfred but once he started hanging out with Manfred and Sid and got close to the baby he realized that he couldn't get the baby and just became friends with everyone. ""Ice Age"" had a lot of funny scenes and funny dialogue and was just an overall funny movie not just for kids but for everyone if they're interested.

","I rented 'Ice Age' for my neice and newphews while I was babysitting one afternoon. I saw a preview for this film in a theater, and truth be told, I wasn't too keen on seeing it. Still, I'd read some great reviews and I wanted a good movie for the kids. I am glad I took a chance on it.<br/><br/>Ray Romano heads an all-star cast of voices as Manfred the mammoth. The story takes place during the ice age, where primitive man and ancient animals are going head to head. Denis Leary provides the voice of Diago, a cunning saber-tooth tiger who kidnaps a human baby as revenge against the humans for destroying some of his pack. Manfred and his dorky sidekick, Sid (John Leguizamo) get ahold of the baby, and vow to return it. Diago has plans to thwart their good intentions. Along way, Manfred, Sid, and Diago learn about the goodness that lies in every heart, but they also learn some important lessons about themselves.<br/><br/>I love this movie for three reasons: A) The pathetic squirrel chasing after the nut, almost a totally unrelated tangent to the story, is hilarious. B) Unlike a great many animated films, there are no disgusting bad guys to beat up. The premise of the story is simple and not too complex for little kids to figure out. There is also a very positive message that you don't have to dig around to find. C) The cast of voices, which also includes Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, Cedric the Entertainer, Diedrich Bader, and Jane Krakowski, are wonderful.<br/><br/>I am not sure that all adults would like this movie, but my neice and nephews LOVED it. I really liked it too, and I would recommend it to any parents who want a nice, refreshing break from hard-core violence and glittery, overactive animation."

So I know exactly what is going on, but in this movie I understood him and what he was doing. There was one part though in the movie at the end the sand splits in half, which was not quite realistic, funny but not realistic.

","Having long been a fan of computer animation, back from the days<br/><br/>where tech wizards fiddled with strangely vacant faces and<br/><br/>bouncing tea pots, Ice Age is another in a recent trend of computer<br/><br/>animated features that are proving the medium is finally coming of<br/><br/>age.<br/><br/>The obvious comparisons with 'Shrek' , 'Toy Story' and 'Monsters<br/><br/>inc' are immediate.  However, Ice Age, should probably be<br/><br/>compared to Classic 'Warner Bros' animations than it's silicon<br/><br/>chip rendered cousins.  The Pacing, humour and story are<br/><br/>obviously inspired by celluloid than to the likes of Shrek.<br/><br/>The story is pretty basic, and by no means original, but it is this<br/><br/>simplicity that creates the opportunity for the strengths of Ice Age to<br/><br/>shine, more so than the 'others'.  With one of the most amusing<br/><br/>opening scenes of any film, you know that this is going to be fun<br/><br/>from start to finish, with humour (like shrek et al) that is aimed at<br/><br/>children, but geared towards adults.<br/><br/>So lets speak of the animation.  The power of the the technology<br/><br/>has progressed to a stage where almost anything is possible. <br/><br/>What the makers have done though, with Ice Age, is capture the<br/><br/>subtlety of expression that many might miss.  For Example the<br/><br/>'squirrel' with a nervous twitch in his eye. While the overall 'art<br/><br/>direction' is beautiful and at times, absolutely stunning, though<br/><br/>heavily stylized.  A direction which I think is more interesting that<br/><br/>trying to create absolute realism.<br/><br/>Ice age is hilarious, and expressive.  While the 'Dodo' scene is<br/><br/>one of the most clever and funny scenes of any Computer<br/><br/>animated feature.<br/><br/>Remember now, cartoons are not just for kids, and this is a<br/><br/>'cartoon', but it is more than that, it is a film where the directors<br/><br/>have absolute control over every expression, action and<br/><br/>mannerism of its actors.

","Wohoo! Animated movie! These usually make me curious...and I usually like to compare them, as long as they're comedies, to ""The Emperor's New Groove""...so here we go on a short ride in the ICE AGE...

The sweet little mammal, with his acorn! I believe Scrat's probably the funniest character in the movie. Well, after a nice introduction, and a little bit of action, Manfred and Sid end up in looking after a human baby. They decide to take the baby back to the humans, but they have a long way to go, and they have to catch up with the humans. Just then comes Diego...he's mission is to take the baby alive to the leader of the saber-toothed tigers. Unluckily for him, it's not really easy to get the baby from a huge mammoth...so he initially decides to betray his companions, and to lead them to the horde of saber-toothed tigers...well, it's not really a horde, only several, but...enough to finish Manfred. Of course, things will become rather complicated on the way, and a bond will appear between them. The movie is nice, and enjoyable, but I believe it's not as good as The Emperor's New Groove...that one's a lot funnier!

","No day passes without a new released computer animated movie, so we now really have chances to see more than some nice effects. After watching Ice Age I felt that's it was not that big impact on me than some other films of this genre.<br/><br/>But it's because I am a Big Guy now, and I am pretty sure that this is a very enjoyable movie for children (maybe up to 14). The story is quite simple, and the ""actors"" are funny in a cute way, without any crude or complex humour. Even the ""evil"" is lovely, fluffy big cat with those funny teeth. And the story has a happy end, which was a small disappointment for me (knowing that most of the main characters are doomed to extinction in a sad way) but a great thing for children. And apart from some fights nobody dies (not even when he gets stomped on by a mammoth, several times), which made a cartoony feeling.<br/><br/>The computer animation part is nice but nothing special, apart from some really nice cartoony feeling scenes, when you feel like walking in a nice painting or pages of a comics. [Which means lots of work nevertheless!]<br/><br/>There were some gags which made me smile - I accept, the creators tried to satisfy those grownups - but they are hard to spot and (in my opinion) better left unnoticed, since it does not feel to fit into the story.<br/><br/>Overall it's a nice movie, but it's rather in the ideal-world-and-fluffy-animals-for-children disney cliche. If you don't hate cute animals making funny things, watch it at least once."

","My expectations for ICE AGE were not great; after the pretty uninspired trailer, I rented the movie primarily for the kids. But then I always say that, and much like TOY STORY before it, ICE AGE is much more than a film that's just for the nippers. Indeed, it's a charming, heartfelt tale that will appeal to people of all ages. The animation is outstanding, and ICE AGE is yet another example of the shift within the genre away from the painstakingly hand drawn, classic Disney cartoons of old to the modern, computer-assisted animated features of today. (Although the work in animated flicks such as ICE AGE is no less impressive. Check out the DVD behind the scenes features for an eye-opening look at the Â– ahem Â– Â‘mammoth' task involved in bringing such a project to life.)<br/><br/>Set 20,000 years previously in the midst of an Ice Age, the film opens with a look at the most amusing character in the movie: Scrat, the sabre-toothed squirrel. Poor Scrat wants nothing more than to bury an acorn, his food source for the winter, and throughout the film we're treated to his exploits as he attempts to do this supposedly simple task. Yet, no matter what he does, no matter how hard he tries, he is continuously foiled by the elements, his fellow beasts, or just plain bad luck. Scrat is a hilarious creation and his scenes are the highlight of the entire movie. (Scrat, incidentally, is Â‘voiced' Â– a series of screeches, grunts and screams Â– by ICE AGE director Chris Wedge. Make sure you check out the extra Scrat animated short on the DVD Â– it's the best of the lot.)<br/><br/>The true story of ICE AGE centres on the tale of three unlikely friends: Manfred (Ray Romano), an enormous mammoth who decides that, unlike the rest of the world, he'll migrate North this winter; Sid, a lazy, good-for-nothing sloth who talks a mile-a-minute (voiced by the hilarious John Leguizamo); and Diego (Dennis Leary), a fierce, sly sabre-toothed tiger who doesn't tolerate fools Â– or anyone else Â– lightly. The trio are brought together by the discovery of a human baby. Sid decides that the right thing to do is to return the child to its father, and talks the reluctant Manfred around. Diego's motives are more sinister Â– his secret mission is to return the child to his pack.<br/><br/>The story progresses as the three battle increasingly harsh conditions, including snowstorms, wind, volcanoes, a theme park inspired ice-ride through a cave, and more, as they move on towards their destiny. Along the way they become closer to each other and to the man-child, particularly the confused Diego, who begins to question his motives. Manfred, meantime, battles with inner demons about his own feelings towards mankind, while the upbeat Sid blunders in regardless of the dangers around him.<br/><br/>
The principle cast of ICE AGE provide a significant amount of character in their respective parts. In particular, John Leguizamo's Sid is very funny indeed, and the extra on the DVD that shows us how Leguizamo came up with Sid's very unique, toothsome voice, is worth the price of the DVD alone. In his other work, Ray Romano, a massive star in the U.S. thanks to his EVERYONE LOVES RAYMOND series, but a virtual unknown outside of the States, isn't as funny as he thinks he is. But his nasally, thick voice is perfectly suited to the gruff, no B.S. Manfred. Denis Leary is always good value, and his sixty-a-day croak of a voice is ideal for the sly Diego. As stated above, however, it is the priceless Scrat that steals ICE AGE.<br/><br/>Beautiful animation is almost a prerequisite nowadays; if a movie cannot deliver in that sense, it's almost a failure irrespective of the quality of the story (i.e., POKEMON). ICE AGE has some of the best quality work you will see. The team behind the animation talked of their desire to replicate the work of Chuck Jones ROADRUNNER style of animation Â– that being, simply, sketched backgrounds with the focus on detail applied completely to the characters in the foreground. Whilst the background detail is a million miles above that seen in Jones' classic work, the ICE AGE team have succeeded in making the foreground so visually appealing that you'll hardly notice anything else. But you should, as some of the background scenery, particularly in long shot POV, is breathtaking.<br/><br/>But it's the animation on the main characters that you've paid to see and it doesn't disappoint Â– little things, like the attention paid to Manfred's eyes, the lone source of all of his emotion and feelings, are handled with the utmost in care and detail. Likewise Diego's smooth, graceful yet twitchy mannerisms beat that seen of the big cats in Disney's THE LION KING. Sid, of the three main leads, steals the show with his endless repartee and exaggerated goofiness, and that's mostly thanks to Leguizamo, who clearly had a blast with the character.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat predictable, but don't let that spoil your enjoyment. It's enormous fun. As I said, I came in expecting little Â‘cause of the poor trailer but had a blast. Which is a very good sign.<br/><br/>To conclude, this falls just short of the overall quality of TOY STORY or TOY STORY 2 but is miles better than any Disney film post THE LION KING. If you have kids, this is highly recommended, but also give it a look yourself. And the DVD is a must buy if you have already seen and enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Rating: **** (out of five)<br/><br/>DVD Review: So much! Hours and hours of extra animated clips, deleted scenes, behind the scenes, commentaries, etc. So much that you'd do well to buy this DVD if you had an interest in getting into computer animation Â– it's that thorough, and they provide that much background detail. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>DVD: ***** (out of five)"

The baby is cute and the mammoth is cute and the other little dude is cute ... and the guy who has a problem hanging onto his acorn is cute etc. Even though this movie is more for younger kids, I enjoyed it even though I'm 13. This is a cool movie that really helps you calm down, and yep, it's kind of sad near the end. (Sorry, did that spoil much?) Here's a cool movie that you shouldn't miss, even if you think it looks dumb, it's heaps better than what it seems."
"Dockelektro","7","0","0","18 July 2002"," Now I know why this was originally intended to be a drama.
","Ok, at the beginning it looked like ""Shrek"" - the loner that is persistently followed by the comic relief. Then it evolves into something really compelling, as the gauntlet is set. And the result is an enjoyable movie, which has moments that I agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch (Manny's past, for example). The premise has been obviously worked for a long time, so that they can suceed in making a movie set with almost no different sets (only ice caps and rocks), and three characters. It's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it. As I said, it can be tear-jerking at some times, so, kids, be warned. The real letdown is the animation. This wasn't so souped up like the toy story movies or shrek, and it shows. The humans are unrealistic, and we have seen better examples of CGI before. But don't let this stain the record: as a solo effort, ""Ice Age"" is commendable. And it will gather many fans, I have no doubt. Oh and yes, the moments with that small mouse are priceless, and show-stealing."

It is worth taking kids 10 and under to, but teens would probably find it a tad bit boring.  Also, the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting.

","*May contain spoilers* *May contain spoilers*<br/><br/>In the age of Shrek(the movie) & Pixar(the studio), this is a much more traditional animation film. It put together some characters that normally wouldn't be seen together(not to mentioned, try to save a human baby and bring it back to his father). They begin as enemies and end as best friend. If this sound like a Disney film, it is(only made through 20th Century Fox). The trailer to the movie was one of the best I've seen in ages, but the movie doesn't live to the expectation the trailer set. The problem lie with the fact that the makers of the film didn't made up their mind who is the target audience of the film. Yes, there are some jokes in the film that only adults will understand but  the film is mostly aimed at children. The parents will enjoy the fact that for 90 min. their children's attention is focused on something else than them. The backgrounds are excellent and the voice are good but this is nothing more the a nice film. Children will love this film, adults will only like it."
"chrisbrown6453","7","0","0","24 June 2002"," The animated Ice Age has more than a couple of visually exciting sequences. Well done story, but just not quite Toy Story quality.
","A glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: A Space Odyssey. Miles apart in vision, but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless. A magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn. You've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and, results, an avalanche. The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. <br/><br/>The movie traces two characters, a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a buck-toothed sloth (John Leguizamo) as they try to migrate south. They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. They are joined by a saber tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan, by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap. Diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all, but Diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end. <br/><br/>There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in Shrek. Characters contemplate on why they're in the Ice Age, while they could have called it The Big Chill or the Nippy Era. Some characters wish for a forthcoming global warming. Another great line about the mating issues between girlfriends: `All the great guys are never around. The sensitive ones get eaten.' Throwaway lines galore, whimsical comedy and light-fingered adventure makes this one pretty easy to watch. Also, food is so scarce for the nice vegetarians that they consider dandelions and pine cones as `good eating.' <br/><br/>The vocal talents of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary make good on their personas, while the children will delight in their antics, the adults will fancy their riffs on their own talents. There is some mild violence and intense content, but kids will be jazzed by the excitement and will get one of their early introductions of the age-old battle of good versus evil, and family tradition and friendship are strong thematic ties. The animators also make majestic use of background landscapes that are coolly fantastic."
"roykommers","Null","0","0","19 June 2002"," Great new style
","Ice age is a really entertaining movie, a lot of laughs for the kids and their parents and really nice graphics. A completely new style was used. A smart move you don't want your work to end being crushed by pixar films or the Box-buster Shrek, which has great graphics but a bit of the same we have had already seen with Toy Story, and a lot of other computer animated movies. Instead of trying to make the characters and backgrounds as realistic as possible they tried to give the movie more the style of a classic cartoon, at which they succeeded, so don't expect to see Manfred the Mammoth's hair move in the wind like donkey's does in Shrek. But you can expect a movie that has a great use of colours and will give you the feeling of the old cartoons from fifteen years ago.<br/><br/>The children will love all the characters (and so will adults), especially Sid the Sloth. I have never seen a cartoon character so adorable as Sid.<br/><br/>The story is a little too sweet and predictable but the good humour makes up for that. The many jokes the movie is rich are great, as well for the little ones as for the more mature people under us, the more adult humour is brought to us very subtle and some of the jokes will never be understood by children or the less intelligent living among us. Especially the side story of the acorn-adventures of the little saber-tooth squirrel Scrat is a lot of fun and makes sure that even in the more serious parts of the movie there is humour present.<br/><br/>To conclude: this is a great movie for everyone, the humour is as much fun for adults as it is for children. The only thing I liked less was the story line, but that is forgiven because everything else is great and deserves a lot more credit than it has been given."
"taikman","7","0","0","18 June 2002"," Funny and well made, but not one of the best animated movies.
","I love cartoons. They can show things that films with 'real' actors and scenery cannot - though computer effects are changing that more and more. They can push the boundaries of satire ('The Simpsons'), good taste ('South Park'), spectacle ('Aladdin'), or reality  ('Toy Story'). There are some good examples of this in 'Ice Age', such as when we see a motley herd of now-extinct mammals migrating across countryside, chatting like old friends. Such scenes are a pleasure to watch, as we get the feeling of both the familiar and the strange at the same time, usually in a way that makes us laugh. While Ice Age is not as good as the top animated movies of all time, it's a really fun film. Sit back, enjoy the deliberate anachronisms, the lovely backgrounds and the belly-laughs.<br/><br/>The story follows Manfred the grumpy mammoth, Sid, an idiotic sloth, and Diego, a sabretooth tiger, as they take a human baby back to his tribe - for very different reasons. On the way, naturally, they have a whole lot of problems. Also popping up throughout the journey is Scrat, history's unluckiest rodent, who is desperately trying to bury an acorn for the winter: in glaciers, on top of dead trees, in ice-caves. His opening scene is a classic.<br/><br/>It's a simple story with a very predictable end and a middle that is just a series of funny incidents with some character-building moments thrown in, but some of the scenes, such as the nappy-changing or the dodos, are hilarious, the animals are likeable and it looks good. There is one quite touching moment too, when cave paintings of mammoths come to life in front of Manfred's eyes.<br/><br/>Not a must-see, but good for a fun hour or so.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Firstly, let me say that I haven't enjoyed most of the kids films that have come out these past few years. The last childrens film I actually enjoyed was Beauty and the Beast (1992 version). Since then I haven't been impressed. I thought to myself that it was my age and that adults such as myself can't enjoy a kids movie. Well, I enjoyed this movie very much indeed.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful and so is the colour. The story is moralistic and very well done. There's comedy, tragedy, action and adventure throughout. Everyone involved in the production of this film from the director to the artists and all the rest deserve a huge pat on the back and it would be nice if this film won an award.<br/><br/>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) In this film a mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger attempt to return a young infant to his tribe. Along the way they get up to all kind of strange things. At times, I was on the edge of the seat and I really felt myself caring for the characters-including the saber-toothed tiger. This was a very moralistic cartoon and reminded me of the beautiful Land Before Time series of films. <br/><br/>The characters were all great. The sloth was annoying but likeable at the same time (you always find characters like him in a film like this). The mammoth was my favourite. He was the leader in a sense and whilst he too was annoyed by the sloth and the tiger he nevertheless cared for them both. The tiger was a great character as well. His motives for returning the boy to his tribe were different to the sloths and the mammoths motives. What were his motives I hear you ask? Well, see the film and you will find out.<br/><br/>There was one recurring character that had me laughing at times. Some kind of creature (I guess it was some kind of rodent) was trying to find a place to bury his acorn. This set up all kinds of comic situations-particularly one at the end of the film.<br/><br/>All in all this was a terrific film to watch and for the first time in ages I came out of the cinema feeling that my money was well spent."

","Let's be honest 70% of the people going to see this movie will be Star Wars fans trying to catch a glimpse of the Episode 2 Trailer ""The Clone War"". Part of the motivation for myself was certainly that dubious pleasure, but also I'd been suckered by the rather amusing trailers. If only the movie had been as funny as the trailers !<br/><br/>The running gag throughout the film of the squirrel and the nut was great, but this sort of thing belonged in a Looney Tune NOT a top line sophisticated CGI animated feature. To say that this was THE funniest bit of the film is a sad indictment of the state of FOX's animated features. Critics hated ""Titan AE"", and yet that was so much more a better film pitched at just the right level.<br/><br/>""Ice Age"" had none of the knowing humour of ""Shrek"", or the wide appeal of ""Monster Inc"". It was more of a throwback to the Disney flicks of the late 60s/early 70s had banal characters going on a quest against a silkily sly enemy ie ""The Jungle Book"".<br/><br/>Manfred, Sid, and Diego were fairly well characterised 'road' buddies with their fair share of good lines a piece, but nothing from the script stuck in my head after viewing. There was no 'Do you think he's compensating for something' style wit here !<br/><br/>The movie's two saving graces (apart from the squirrel) were the stand out ice cavern rollercoaster ride sequence, and Dodo extinction gag. The ice cavern (with sly asides to the opening scene in 'The X-Files' movie), was an exciting, funny and well animated (ice that looks like ice-what will they think of next !!!) scene. The Dodo bit starring suicidal dodos (why they became extinct, geddit ??!) was probably the only 'adult' appealing bit in the feature. A neat touch,  dodos scrambling over each other unwittingly going to their deaths !<br/><br/>So with all it's unsophisticated humour kids will probably lap this film up, but I feel their attention spans will be tried at times as mine certainly was-and the whole film was only about 85 minutes long !<br/><br/>Next time FOX forget the cutesy kid, forget the iritating sloth, and forget plagarising past animated epics from Disney, and Warner. The future was 'Titan AE' with a bit of tweaking required..."

","Going to see this movie, I was concerned that the plot would be aimed at a younger target audience.  I was delighted to find that this movie offered not only something for the kids, but a lot of humor and sentiment that adults can and will appreciate.  I was thoroughly entertained by this movie!<br/><br/>The computer animation was stunning (the humans were a little blocky!), the dialogue was snappy and crisp, and the physical comedy was reminiscent of the old road runner/wile e. coyote cartoons of my youth.  It's difficult to find quality slapstick humor on television these days, as kids are desensitized to violence, and need more sophistication in their cartoons than simple physical comedy. Ice Age will please many who long for the golden age of cartoons with its simple physical gags and more complex humorous dialogue aimed at both adults and kids.  On top of all this is a heart-warming tale with a moral of seeing past what's on the outside, and loyalty among friends.  I was glad by the fact that the theater was filled with families, and I heard equal spurts of laughter from parents, and their kids. This movie is a must see!"

","Ice Age is the latest computer animated film to come down the pipe and is certainly a pleasant way to spend time staring at the big screen while transferring popcorn to your mouth.<br/><br/>The story is simplistic (a mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger and a sloth return a lost baby to its tribe) and appeals more to younger children, lacking the multi-layered depth of Shrek and even Monsters Inc. Not that it's boring. Indeed, there is some stand-out stuff, such as the running gag with the squirrel and the priceless sequence with the dodo's. This latter is not only laugh-aloud funny, but qualitatively even seems lifted from another production altogether. As if often the case, you can tell some scenes had more care, attention, and most likely money, lavished on them than others.<br/><br/>In technical terms, Ice Age breaks no new ground and the script and characterisation, as well as the animation, also lag behind Shrek and Monsters Inc. The fact of the matter is, these two films, have now raised the bar so high they are very hard acts to follow.<br/><br/>The children who were at the press screening I attended certainly sat attentively (but they are German and their teacher had threatened them with massive death if they so much as ... ) and did laugh a few times.<br/><br/>Ice Age certainly qualifies as a good family film and if it gets the kids' minds off the latest Harry Potter merchandise then that's a relief to parents everywhere.<br/><br/>Where the film suffers, though, is the appalling voice performance of Ray Romano as Manfred the Mammoth. He sounds like John Ratzenberger (Cliff the mailman from Cheers), only drugged, depressed and telephoning in his lines. Literally!<br/><br/>Romano might be a name in the US, but anywhere else? So what if he stars in Everybody Loves Raymond? (And what kind of suspicious title is that? ""Whaddya mean you don't love Raymond?! What's wrong wit yer?! You some kinda commie?!""). To most of the world he's Ray Who and it's I've Never Heard of Raymond, Haven't Seen The Show and Care Even Less.<br/><br/>OK, so the film will be dubbed, or at least subtitled, outside english-speaking territories, but his performance is so bad as to seriously drag it down. It's thanks to John Leguizamo, as Sid the Sloth, that the energy isn't so sucked out of you that you dissolve in your seat and slide, a shapeless blob, to the floor. I've thought long and hard about when I last heard such a miscast cartoon voice and still haven't come up with one."

I kept being bothered by the fact that sloths are known to be very slow, but this one moved very quickly.  I couldn't accept that two different species of rhinoceros would be hanging out together.  I just couldn't let myself get into it as a cartoon.  Maybe that was because the animation was so good. If the animation had looked more fake, maybe I could have gotten into the improbable plot better<br/><br/>I was offended that the Dodo's were shown as going extinct because of stupidity, rather than because of human predation, which was the reality of the thing -- though I must say that their idiotic group think was an excellent social commentary.  I was also offended that the Native Americans were shown as having extremely low foreheads, sort of like the tiger, implying that they did not have any brains.<br/><br/>NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS:<br/><br/>It wasn't too scary or violent and had a nice heartwarming story, so it would be o.k. for most kids, though I still don't think that it's a good idea to take pre-schoolers to movies that have any violence or any suspense, and this does have some.<br/><br/>It is nice that people are starting to pay attention to the age of the giant mammals, because it has been kind of ignored in favor of the dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The facial expressions and acting were just great.

","""Ice Age"" falls into one of those vague areas of film criticism. The animated movie makes you want to like it so much, despite not being perfect. The film pours out creative energy and slapstick high jinks for the entire 90 minutes. This computer animated movie doesn't miss a beat in terms of visual style. A ice sliding sequence is especially impressive. The story, meanwhile, revolves around a sloth (John Leguizamo) named Sid, Manfred the mammoth (Ray Romano) and Diego (Dennis Leary) a tiger. The group of animals are trying to return a baby to its tribe after he ends up away from them following a Sabertooth tiger attack. ""Ice Age"" reminds one of the classic Warner Brother's Wile E. Coyote cartoons. Scrat, a wide-eyed, prehistoric squirrel provides some truly funny moments in a desperate attempt to open up a nut. Despite, the strengths of some funny slapstick comedy and solid voice characterizations, the film does feel tad too familiar. Computer animation provided cinema with some terrific films the past two to three years including: ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Shrek"". The animation, while still impressive, does have that ""been there, done that"" touch to it. The film contains moments of obvious sappiness and overall is not quite as original as the wide range of humor displayed in ""Shrek"". Yet, all that being said, ""Ice Age"" delivers the goods. It's a solid family film, even if the style and script reek of familiarity. A 7 out of 10."

","Director Carlos Saldanha's animated feature ""Ice Age"" starts ordinarily, then half way through it finds it's voice and says something remarkable about communities or ""herds"". This is a good surprise, and a welcome one. <br/><br/>""Ice Age"" is 20th Century Fox's entry into cutting edge animated feature market. Techincally, it is not on par with some of the Disney or Dreamworks entries, though what makes it promising is that it has a worthwhile story to tell much like ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" Note that ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters"" are better movies. For one thing the story by Michael Wilson and the screenplay by Wilson and Michael Berg wastes time wandering in the first half, without really providing a context for what they really want to say. <br/><br/>Our hero Manny, the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Ramano), is migrating south, though curiously alone. He is suffering over his family from his past. He saves a goofy sloth, Sid (voiced by John Leguizamo) from a curious pair of male Rhinos-- a friend and I ""wondered"" about the nature of their relationship. The reluctant Manny agrees to take on Sid as a traveling bud. <br/><br/>Along the way Manny and Sid become involved in the dark plot of a Sabertooth Tiger pack to kidnap a human child. Manny rescues the child in the failed attempt, and the child joins their herd. Sabertooth Diego (voiced by the always edgy Denis Leary) is the Judas who joins Manny's herd, pretending to help lead the child back to safely-- he is really following the orders of his leader, the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic). However, Manny saves Diego's life. Diego asks why Manny risked his own life for his. Manny says ""... That's what you do when you're part of a herd."" Now does Manny trust Diego, who is out to betray him? The ""Part of the herd"" or this community conversation saves ""Ice Age"", and offers value. Heroes and leaders can emerge from communities that are very diverse. And these are communities simply because they declared themselves to be--""Our herd"". Heroes and leaders emerging unexpectedly from communities are touching and inspiring-- what is cool that it is also expansive. Ultimately, ""Ice Age"" along with Ramano, Leary, and Leguizamo gets the job done."

Too much digital, too much Lightsabring and its all anachronistic to the classic trilogy, it could still pack some good thrills though.<br/><br/>Now about Ice Age. It doesn't belabour the hip humour like Monsters, Inc., that style I believe is wearing thin already, and after less than a decade. This movie recycles everything basically, Jar Jar included. It still packs some big laughs though I must admit. But other ones are skipped over so quick that there is no time to appreciate them, eg. ""there'll be plenty of time to play extinction later kids."" The story also at points is a bit borderline for it's target audience and after less than a month the movie as a whole starts to rot in the memory. The little dude with the wallnut is the most memorable thing but he gets such a harsh beating from the Coyote/Road Runner gags that you feel too sorry for him, it's extremely violent.<br/><br/>So basically all that's left is the glory of the landscapes and vistas, which are of high note. At the time you forgive the movie for that, but there is not enough otherwise to recommend a second cinema viewing, and the cinema is the only place you'll really appreciate that redeeming factor. Besides that is pretty much all we get nowadays is astounding visuals. 'films', are fast retreating the onslaught of 'movies', and even movies are fleeing the advance of 'blockbusters'. If there is one thing cinema is not short of its technological breakthroughs.<br/><br/>The very conclusion, though irrelivant to the core story is both unexpected and refreshingly novel. But this movie is not much chop, and easily forgettable. Watch Shrek or Toy Story 2 instead, and Disney is unlikely to put anything of that grade out again.

","ICE AGE is a very good computer animation film even if somewhat derivative of other recent titles ( SHREK, DINOSAUR etc. ) in this particular genre. The main characters are quite good, all the way from the aloof Manny the Mammoth to the flippant Sid the Sloth. There is certainly a feeling a ""deja vu"" in the proceedings ( ala DINOSAUR and MONSTERS, INC. ), yet the situations are settings are unique enough to keep the story fresh and entertaining. Some of the strong points are Diego's character development from an antagonist to hero, and the lovable Scrat whose presence charms even if adding nothing to the storyline ( seemingly inspired by toon-master Tex Avery ).<br/><br/>Of course, the human characters in ICE AGE are as minimal as to be expected; even the baby ( though cute ) is a minor presence though constantly seen throughout. One has to wonder why these prehistoric mammals are going through all this bother to bring this infant back to its clan. Another weakness is with Manny himself; there are practically no insights into the basic nature of this massive elephant except for a brief incident where he remembers his family being killed by hunters ( giving more reason to wonder about his involvement here ). Sid is better defined but extremely similar to the goofy lemur in DINOSAUR ( with a ""hot tub"" scene where he is also trying to wow the ladies much like the Disney pic ).<br/><br/>Some other notable elements are the other saber-toothed cats of Diego's pride, either wholly evil or comical like THE LION KING, and the hilarious suicidal Dodos which didn't die out until comparatively recent times. In spite of the aforementioned familiarity of the material, there is enough originality and cleverness to more than compensate for this recycling of story elements to make it a winner. Pleasing to the eyes, ICE AGE doesn't redefine the genre but is just as worthy as any of the others ( and in some regards even better ).<br/><br/>On a 1-10 scale, a solid 8"

I liked the way the animators did not go for total realism, animated films (I hate to say 'cartoons') of this nature need to be slightly divorced from reality for the zany humour to have the right effect. The rendering of the characters' motion is particularly well done, IMHO much better than, say, 'Final Fantasy' - and the voices were much better chosen than other movies of this genre ... I would far rather have a distinctive voice for each character, than a well-known actor chosen just because he/she is well-known (to increase hype/attendance??).<br/><br/>What I also liked is the cross-generation appeal of this film, there were people there aged from 3 to geriatry and EVERYONE enjoyed it - helped (I think) by the largely visual humour, the lack of snappy, fast-talking characters of the Robin Williams mold and the absence of 'in-jokes'.<br/><br/>

","Animation has always managed to keep up with the current techology. Nowadays, the big thing is computer-generated animation.  The leaders in this field is Pixar, the studio under the wing of Disney, which has given us ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc.""  Then, Dreamworks' partner Pacific Data Images came to produce ""Antz"" and ""Shrek.""  Now a new studio steps into the ring, Blue Sky, which is partnered with 20th Century Fox.  Its first feature, ""Ice Age"" has already shown that it has what it takes to be a major player in the CGI animation game.  ""Ice Age"" isn't as finely polished as a Pixar movie, but it is very well done.  The story has its share of laughs and heartfelt moments.  But the main draw is the sight gags.  The walk through the glacier cave is a classic example.  Plus, the antics of the Scrat also amuse.  Another good point of the movie is its portrayal of prehistoric wildlife.  Almost everyone thinks of dinosaurs, but few people are aware of the more obscure mammals that walked the earth after dinos ruled.  And an interesting cross-section is presented in ""Ice Age.""  Chris Wedge has already given us an epic in ""Ice Age.""  I hope he can continue to give the competition a run for its money!"

The mammoth was a character that I also didn't care for.  He was just a lazy lop that complained the whole movie.  And what did that little weasel in the beginning have to do with anything? This movie could have been much better."

","The humans have (unseen, before the film opens) killed a sabertooth tiger, and the tigers want revenge, so they plot to kidnap a human baby. Diego (voice by Denis Leary) is charged with this task, and he partially succeeds, but finds himself sharing three-way custody of the baby with a woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), who rightly don't trust Diego alone with the baby. Manny and Sid want to return the baby to the humans and Diego agrees, although he secretly has other plans. All of this occurs as the ice age is beginning and almost all animals are migrating south. Interspersed with this main story we occasionally see a hapless sabertooth squirrel thingy trying valiantly (and painfully) to find somewhere to hide the acorn he has found. Besides the squirrel there are a number of other very fun bits, such as dodo birds performing ""Tae Kwon-Dodo"" and showing why they became extinct, as well as references to Star Trek and Titanic.<br/><br/>The animation is not as polished or flashy as in Shrek or Monsters, Inc., but it might be a little more human. On the whole, I definitely enjoyed this film and would recommend it, but the story which holds the brilliant bits together is pretty obvious and a little too precious to let it measure up to the high standards set by other recent animated films."

He's not only really funny-looking, he's also hilarious.  The squirrel is also cool, although you end up feeling so sorry for him because he's so unlucky. It's not a brilliant movie, but it's fun, and a good family film (You know, the ones where you say you're going with the kids to watch, but you're really watching it yourself).

"DeepJedi","Null","0","0","8 April 2002"," Not as good as it might seem...
","This film raises quite a few points about what qualifies as good animation these days.  Many people seem to be of the opinion that computer generated animation is automatically 'better' than the hand drawn variety but I fail to see it.  How superficial has our society become when we claim to be satisfactorily entertained by a flimsy story rendered in a largely sterile style of animation?  Lost to us is the artistry and skill with which past greats like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was brought to us.  There are many reasons why this is not a particularly good film, yet all require one to think, so most people will fail to realise this and give it a good review; fair enough.  If you only want an entertaining pastime for 80 minutes or so, something to occupy the kids on a Sunday afternoon, then Ice Age will do the job better than many; at least it *is* suitable for kids (all too rare these days, even when intended for them) with little scatological humour and no jokes of a sexual nature. Look more critically at Ice Age though and several things are apparent.  The story, as I have said, is wafer thin, making the film rely too heavily on the character animation for its entertainment value.  These are fine but I couldn't help but feel that *all* the effort had gone into them; apart from the three main characters, all the others looked very plain and in many cases e.g. the fat sabre-toothed tiger and the small, particularly nasty, sabre-toothed tiger, actually seemed to have been designed by different hands.  This is a bad thing in any type of film, when the viewer senses that not everyone who was on board the project was pulling in the same direction. The style of these animations wasn't in harmony with the leads. Furthermore, none of them had any real depth; an attempt was made at this with Manfred, but it was way too little to generate the kind of sympathy audiences built up for characters in the great Disney features.  This means that Ice Age relies throughout, entirely, on the nuances of animation in what the characters do as opposed to what motivates them.  Luckily, what the characters do *is* entertaining - they are funny, look great, and say funny things with good sounding voices.  There are some great set pieces e.g. the ice slide sequence, and the genuinely dramatic lava flow, with some great sound effects. I was unhappy with the super-realistic water; judging from everything else in the film, the intent wasn't to make the film 'realistic' yet the water looked incredibly so.  This worked to draw the attention to how real the water looked and away from the film; yet it clearly couldn't have been rendered in any other way than by computer, so surely this undermines any real artistic talent that may have been on display elsewhere.  I wish more effort had been put into story and characterisation than in developing water-rendering computer software. As well as those characters that looked odd, the entire dodo sequence didn't seem to fit in with the film's look.<br/><br/>Overall, Ice Age is a slick-appearing film with too much emphasis on the superficial, which, given the success of the overated Pixar films, is exactly what most people want."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** How can anyone with half a brain really think this was a great film?!<br/><br/>
Yes the scenes with the squirrel are very funny, but what does it say about a film when the star is a non-talking character who has absolutely nothing what so ever to do with the story.  The squirrel is basically just comic relief, which this film is certainly in dire need of.  It reminds me of that Simpsons episode - one of the few under par episodes - that they salvaged by having characters pop up every so often blurting out, ""worst episode ever"". Realising that the episode was seriously lacking on the story front, they inserted this comic relief gag to help people make it through to the end. At least in the Simpsons case they brought attention to the fact that they knew the episode was weak, but in Ice Age they try and distract you from the film's serious shortcomings - and apparently they succeeded with many a viewer.<br/><br/>There were a few mildly amusing gags in Ice Age, but these by no means make up for the horrifically weak story, which is full of holes and convenient solutions that seem tacked on.  A film should not simply be a collection of gags.  Even those who have commented on the weakness of the story seem to be ready to excuse it because it's a film for kids.  But what is clear from the success of all of Pixar's films, as well as Shrek, and even a lot of old Disney classics for that matter, is that children not only can handle complex plots with a bit of depth - come on give them some credit as thinking human beings - but they like them.  That's also why the heartfelt scenes in Ice Age involving the characters interacting with the baby are both superficial and nauseatingly mawkish, while in Monsters Inc. you can get into the cuteness of the little girl Boo interacting with Mike and Sullivan (because they're invested and layered), and still find the scene hilarious.<br/><br/>Things that annoyed me most:<br/><br/>-The whole reason why the leader of the saber-tooth tigers wants the baby alive, which is the foundation for the entire story, is not very believable as it is set up in the film,and is not strong enough to drive things convincingly to the final showdown.<br/><br/>-The mammoth's reasons for wanting to defend and ultimately save the human child from the tigers.  You see very early on that despite his gruffness, he has a soft spot for anyone in trouble.  Then through a maudlin scene later on you understand that he once had a mate and child, who were hunted and killed by humans - boo hoo - and since then he instinctively helps children in trouble?!  Including a child of the creatures that perpetrated the horrible deed and deprived him of his love and joy.  He, if anyone, had reason to want to kill the darn thing.  Compare this to Shirkahn in Jungle Book, who wants to kill the man-cub before he grows up to be a man and kills him - much more believable, don't you think?  If they do a sequel to Ice Age that's what should happen - the child grows up, roasts the sloth and leads a hunting party that stones the mammoth to death.<br/><br/>-The plan to outwit the tigers at the end is not well founded - I mean, the sloth suddenly saving the day on a snowboard, where did that come from?! It might be kind of fun, but it comes out of nowhere and has the feel of a last minute brainstorm trying to decide how to finish a badly thought-out story.<br/><br/>-So much of it felt borrowed directly from other films, almost like a blueprint for success: Dinosaurs, Tarzan, Shrek, Monsters Inc. etc - only all these did it better.<br/><br/>-As for the CG: felt far more flat and dead than Pixar's work and the textures felt no better even than Shrek's, though Shrek had an excellent script so it didn't matter.  Also, the movement, especially the tigers running through the snow at the end of the film, sometimes felt a bit like Playstation 2 characters.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I'll leave it here.  Hope there are a few sane people out there who didn't let FOX pull the wool over their eyes."

","With the success of ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" Fox has decided to give their brand of computer-based animation a try. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close to the aforementioned films. While it is cute and kids will most likely enjoy it, it's not of the caliber of its competitors and doesn't seem to reach its full potential.  First time director Chris Wedge does well keeping the film rolling along at an ADD-acceptable pace, but the overall feel of the movie isn't as fun as it looks in the previews. The voices are provided by B-listers Ray Romano, Denis Leary, and John Leguizamo, who do an OK job, but don't seem to make the characters loveable enough.  The opening sequence (which is what you may have seen in previews last year) with the little furry animal and the acorn is classic, but the dialogue-heavy sequences aren't quite as funny. The plot isn't too bad, but the sequence of events is pretty predictable. While no one is expecting anything groundbreaking, there's nothing really new here. This is one that is worth taking the kids to, but will still be OK to wait for video as well. It's not too adult and not too childish either. This film wasn't made for critics, though. It was made for kids so in that respect it's good. Through the eyes of a child, this one is pretty entertaining. Go ahead and check it out if it looks good to you (or your kids)."

","It's not quite up there with the likes of great animated films such as Toy Story and The Iron Giant, but it will definitely keep you entertained.  The action and slapstick bits feel much like watching a classic Looney Tune short.  The dialogue has enough witticisms to get it by, but thankfully knows when to stop and let the physical humor garner the laughs.  The movie does have a serious side involving returning a human baby to its tribe.  It serves well enough to provide a plot, but couldn't have been pushed much further without making this a tedious movie.  The voice talent is overall very good.  John Lequizamo's Sid the Sloth in particular fits the character quite well.  I didn't mind Ray Romano's monotonic rendering of the mammoth, and his tone makes sense when you learn the character's background, but I can see where some people wouldn't like it.  Visually, the animal characters are all rendered in a unique and distinctly caricatured style.  The humans don't look as good given their style, but since the story doesn't focus on them it wasn't too distracting.  The scenery is sometimes beautiful, given that there's only so much you can do with a movie set mostly in the snow. <br/><br/>
In short, when it tries to be funny, it generally succeeds.  The plot is indeed an amalgam of Things We've Seen Before, but I was willing to forgive that to get to enjoy the laughs.

Even a lesser Disney effort like Return to Neverland has more to offer in it's first two minutes than all of Ice Age.  All artistic merit has been abandoned in lieu of juvenile computer graphics and a tired story line. Just because the producers knew their intended audience would not demand more than a typical computer game does not mean they had to dive so low in the intelligence pool.  Don't expect kids seeing this film today sharing it with their own kids twenty years from now.  More likely they will be denying they even saw it.  My vote for the worse film, so far, of 2002.

","From the realm of digital animation, this is a film that is geared to the younger set, but one that most adults will find pleasantly entertaining, as well.  Heavy on visual humor, with a few one-liners thrown in for good measure, `Ice Age,' directed by Carlos Saldanha and Chris Wedge, is a fairly pedestrian, family comedy that is viewer friendly and has a heart as big as it's main character, who just happens to be a mammoth named Manfred.<br/><br/>	It's the Ice Age, and the migration is on; but as the mammals begin to move, three very distinct individuals are about to be thrown together by circumstances of fate:  Manfred the Mammoth (Ray Romano) insists on going against the tide of the migration movement (literally), and it brings him in touch with Sid the Sloth (John Leguizamo), who awakens from his slothful slumber to find that he's been left behind by the other sloths.  Meanwhile, a pack of Sabertooth Tigers, led by the ruthless Soto (Goran Visnjic), is about to exact revenge on the humans, the hunters he feels are responsible for the decimation of his pack.  An attack is planned, with Soto especially intent on claiming a human baby as his prize.  But during the attack, one of Soto's pack, Diego (Denis Leary), fails to prevent the baby's mother from escaping with her child.  Outraged that the baby has escaped his grasp, Soto charges Diego with the task of locating the baby and bringing him back, alive.  What Diego does not know, however, is that the baby has ended up in the care of one of the most unlikely duos imaginable, Manfred and Sid, who have joined forces in an attempt to locate the humans and return the baby to it's herd.  When Diego realizes what has happened, he decides that his best shot at getting ahold of the baby is to join Manfred and Sid in their quest, which he does by convincing them that they need him-- a tracker by nature-- if they are to succeed in finding the humans, who are also on the move.  And so they begin their journey, with Manfred and Sid unaware of the treachery at hand, lying hidden in their very midst.<br/><br/>	Unlike other prominent films of this genre, such as `Shrek,' or even `Monster's Inc.,' `Ice Age' is not terrifically clever or witty; nor does it try to be.  The strength of this film, in fact, lies in the very straightforward manner in which it is presented, and the filmmakers obviously made some very deliberate choices as to what they wanted to do with their film, and what exactly they wanted it to be.  Rather than go for the hip and hilarious, they chose warm and funny-- and it works.  There is some subtle humor, but for the most part the jokes are what they are; Saldanha and Wedge do not employ the double entendre, for example, so you don't have to go looking for what they're trying to say.  It's a matter of what you see is what you get.  <br/><br/>	What they do give you are some engaging characters (especially Manfred and Sid) and a number of things that visually stimulate the funny bone, beginning with the hapless squirrel who mugs his way through the opening frames with a nut in tow (and who pops up occasionally throughout the film), whose bug-eyed looks and frantic antics are enough to start you chuckling and take you right on into some full-blown gales of laughter.  And it's all tempered so that it never goes too far over the top into `Road Runner' type slapstick, relying instead on some imaginative touches (such as the stages of evolution of the sloth preserved frozen in ice, with Sid falling into frieze briefly at the end of the tableau) and a basic story that's involving enough to sustain interest.<br/><br/>	Anyone familiar with the TV show `Everybody Loves Raymond' will know what to expect as far as the Manfred character, whom Ray Romano infuses with the same wry persona as his Raymond TV character.  But Romano does it well, his Manfred is quite likable, and he even manages to create a couple of truly poignant moments with him.  Simply put, he gives you a mammoth to whom you can actually relate.  And that's a pretty good piece of acting.<br/><br/>	As Sid, John Leguizamo gives a distinct voice to the film, creating a personality that definitely fits the wall-eyed looks of the sloth.  Like Romano, Leguizamo has a unique comedic style, and the contrast between the two works beautifully for their respective characters and the way in which they play off of one another.  And when you add Denis Leary to the mix-- which offers yet another distinct style of comedy (a bit more on the caustic side)-- the result is quite an interesting and diverse combination that in the end works extremely well.  It should be noted, too, that Leary is comparatively subdued with his character, while Leguizamo gives a stream-of-consciousness type performance, though he manages to stay just this side of Robin Williams territory (which is a positive within the context of this film and this particular character).  Most importantly, all three create characters that succeed in effectively telling the story, and they do it in a way that is not only inoffensive, but which enables the audience to embrace them, as well.<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Jack Black (Zeke), Tara Strong (Roshan), Stephen Root (Rhino), Diedrich Bader (Saber-tooth Tiger) and Jane Krakowski (Jennifer the Sloth).  Entertaining, feel-good family fare, `Ice Age' is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and provide you with a satisfying cinematic experience.  And I dare not neglect to mention the educational significance of this film, too; I mean, where else are you going to find out what really happened to the Dodo Bird?  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10."

","I went to see this because I wanted a real cartoon - you know, the kind animated by pencil rather than keyboard - and it was the only plausible substitute available.  It's a far better substitute than I'd dared hope.<br/><br/>The title says it all: it's an ice age.  We watch animals migrate away from the ice.  That's the point to the film; there is no other.  There IS, admittedly, also a story, and don't believe anyone who tells you it's not a good story; if there's a problem with it, it lies not with its inherent quality but with the fact that it feels at times like an intrusion - something which takes valuable time away from the character-based vignettes about odd-looking mammals travelling through the frozen landscape.  But not so much time that we have any grounds for being impatient.<br/><br/>All the animals (the humans being a trivial exception) are animated well, simply but convincingly.  Essentially they're the three-dimensional counterparts of the Coyote and the Roadrunner, the various beasts developed by Jack Hannah in the inspired cartoons he directed at Disney ... and more recent animals, too, like the raccoon in ""Pocahontas"" or the enchanted llama in ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  The computer animators have really learnt something from their pen-and-paper colleagues.  About time!  Or maybe this film was animated by people who USED to animate by hand but left what they took to be a sinking ship, in which case the gain comes at too high a price.<br/><br/>""Ice Age"" has the best art direction of the ten computer animated film ever released, better even than ""Monsters, Inc.""  At first I though it was just the ice, that the mere fact that everything HAD to be the colour of snow made it virtually impossible to duplicate the ugly, garish, cluttered mishmash of ""Shrek"" (or ""Jimmy Neutron"", a film I'm admittedly judging from the trailer - but doesn't it look like the ghastliest things ever made?). But this is uncharitable.  Many scenes take place on land on which snow has not yet fallen, and the art direction is STILL superb; everything MATCHES the snow, stylised in the same artful way.  And the creatures match the background.  It's not just that they're ""drawn"" similarly; the main point is that they all look and move and are framed relative to other things as though they belong here.  Only three computer-animated features have art direction that's even worth mentioning (except perhaps to complain about): ""Toy Story 2"", ""Monsters, Inc."" and now ""Ice Age"".  Each is visually better than the last.  ""Ice Age"" may not be as inspired overall - it's certainly not as deep - as the two Pixar movies, and perhaps some of the jokes in the first half fall flat.  ""Monsters, Inc."" was a masterpiece; so (to take a recent example of something traditionally animated) was ""The Emperor's New Groove"".  ""Ice Age"" isn't.  But it's still the real deal; a good, sincere movie with something real to offer.  It's not a ""substitute"" anything."

","Personally, I didn't like it. Me giving it 3/10 is pretty generous in my opinion. All the jokes....were old. They were all previously used in previous Disney/Dreamworks cartoons, The Simpsons, and other comedy sitcoms. Seriously. All the comedy was predictable and dull. The writers were in desperate need for new material. The storyline wasn't that bad. But wasn't too interesting either. The idea of a group having to return a baby to its rightful home has been done many times. If you're going to make a movie with a clichÃƒÂ© concept, you're gonna have to make it GOOD. Make it original. Make it different from all the others. This, was just pathetic. You knew what was going to happen from the beginning too. It was just a dull, 'same old' plot from a cartoon that would have been original in 1991. The whole movie, everything... from the jokes, the actions, the plot, the character development, even the dialog...was predictable. <br/><br/>This movie, was disappointing. and I'm a huge animation/cartoon fan.

","Misanthropic woolly mammoth Manny (Romano), lazy sloth Sid (Leguizamo) and wise-ass sabre-toothed tiger Diego (Leary) embark on a trek to reunite abandoned human infant Roshan with his nomadic family.
Sharing a similar plot mechanic to Monsters, Inc. - goofy creatures discover themselves through caring for an abandoned infant - Ice Age is a likable, fast-paced, computer-generated opus that opts for good gags and enjoyable action instead of sappy moralising and Phil Collins songs.<br/><br/>Sidestepping the attention to detail of Pixar, there is an intentional 'cartoon' quality to the character animation and backdrops. The comedy here covers all the bases, from the broad to the sly - in this world, creatures speak, human's can't.<br/><br/>While the journey throws up the requisite thrills and spills, Ice Age's real strength lies in sharply-defined relationship dynamics and likable characters that are worth rooting for. Best of all is Romano's world-weary yet big-hearted mammoth - cold on the outside, warm on the inside. Just like the film itself.<br/><br/>It may lack the fine-tuned inventiveness of Toy Story or the knowingness of Shrek, but it still delivers solid laughs and thrills wrapped up in an infectious sense of character."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","12 December 2014"," Touch of Jungle Book and Monsters, Inc., but succeeds on its own
","""Ice Age"" is widely considered one of the best animated feature films of the 2000s and even if it is already 12 years old now, it is still certainly worth watching. It lost the Animated Oscar to Hayao Miyazaki's ""Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi"" and runs for only 75 minutes not counting the closing credits. It has a parallel to the very successful ""Monsters, Inc."" as the film's protagonists also spend most of the movie with carrying a little kid around that does not really belong into their world. Here it is an Eskimo baby and the saber-toothed tiger, the mammoth and the sloth go on a journey to bring it back to its parents. The voice cast is fairly unknown, no real superstars here unlike most animated films these days. The most known member may be Jack Black.<br/><br/>Visually, it is excellent work. The animated ice world is as nice to look at as all the creatures living in there. In terms of the story, early on it is mostly fun and a kids movie, but it gets deeper towards the end with some really emotionally investing moments. One would be the mammoth seeing the cave paintings and how he reacts to them. Another would be the ending when they reach the Eskimo tribe and give back the baby. I think they chose wisely to make this the final highlight of the film and not the dramatic tiger fight which happens before. Adds a lot of heart to the movie. Apart from that, it is interesting to see how the motivations of the trio change during the journey. The sloth wants to bring the baby back from start to finish. The mammoth really only wants to get rid of the sloth early on and develops a bond with the baby as the story continues. The tiger basically takes the enemy within role and wants to trick the other two in order to feed them to his fellows, but his motivations also change quickly.<br/><br/>Director Chris Wedge started his career with the Academy Award winning animated short film ""Bunny"" and most recently directed ""Epic"", which I enjoyed a lot. He seems to have a talent to take us into new worlds mostly including animals. There are 3 sequels to ""Ice Age"" by now, but Wedge only directed the original. He gave his voice to Scrat in the other films though. The scenes including Scrat will be especially loved by younger audiences and serve as intermissions between the main story parts. It's a pretty interesting concept, somehow like short films within a movie almost completely independent from the story. Co-director Saldanha worked also on the sequels and not too long ago on ""Rio 2"", a film also centered on animals, but in a completely different spot of the planet, especially in terms of the climate.<br/><br/>I recommend watching ""Ice Age"". It could almost be described as a road movie from many centuries ago and that is probably pretty unique. It has lots of humor, basically from start to finish, and heart and is worth a watch also for people who are not that interested in the animation genre."

","I liked Ice Age. I thought it offered a nice change to the films of Pixar (which don't get me wrong I love but everyone needs a change sometimes) and to play on the buddy comedy idea between the creatures worked well.<br/><br/>It's a good film that works on many levels and is one that both adults and kids can enjoy. The voice talents aren't as well known to people in the UK as perhaps they are in the US with Ray Romano being the only one I knew from his great sitcom.<br/><br/>However while I like this film I feel it could have worked much better as a stand alone film because the standard was so good and has only been cheapened by the many sequels it has now produced. Perhaps studios need to understand that not everything needs to be a franchise."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","1","2","11 November 2009"," Humour, touching moments, action, and great animation make this a worthwhile CGI film
","After Pixar and DreamWorks Animation had made successful CGI animated movies, Blue Sky Studios, another computer animation company, made their feature-length debut with this 2002 blockbuster, ""Ice Age"". Even though this was apparently both a critical and box office success, and has spawned two sequels since then, it took me years to finally get around to seeing it. I'm not exactly sure why, since I've been aware of its existence for a few years now and saw ""Robots"" nearly four years ago and ""Horton Hears a Who"" last year. However, despite how long it took me to finally watch it after all these years, I now have seen it. Aware of its popularity beforehand, the movie did not fail to meet my reasonably high expectations.<br/><br/>The story takes place many thousands of years ago. An ice age is coming, and animals are migrating south to escape the increasingly cold weather. A goofy, motormouth sloth named Sid wakes up to find that his family has migrated without him, and he is alone. As he tries to migrate on his own, he meets two rhinos and accidentally angers them. They want to kill him, but as he runs from them, they are fought off by a woolly mammoth named Manfred, whom Sid calls ""Manny."" Sid begins to follow Manny, even though the mammoth finds him annoying and wants him to go away. Nearby, saber-toothed tigers invade the camp of a human tribe in an attempt to eat an infant as an act of revenge! The mother of this infant runs away with him and jumps into a river, leading her to Sid and Manny. Manny saves the baby just before his mother drowns, and the mammoth and sloth must attempt to get him back to his father. Diego, one of the tigers who attacked the camp, helps the two, but what they don't know is that he is leading them to a trap! <br/><br/>The animation here is amazing, which is often the case in these CGI films. They developed some beautiful imagery of frozen land. I didn't like the way the humans were animated as much as the way the animals were, but animation-wise, I definitely can't complain about anything else. There's a lot of humour in the film, often thanks to the goofy antics of Sid, voiced by John Leguizamo (though other characters can also be very funny as well), and the comical situations and conflict the main characters get into on their adventure. The subplot with a squirrel named Scrat trying to bury his acorn in various places is also pretty funny, if you like physical humour. Around the beginning, it may look like the film relies mainly on the animation and laughs for entertainment value, but as it goes on, it proves this isn't quite the case. There are some good action sequences, and eventually some touching moments and good morals, which it wouldn't be the same without. Of the three main cast members, Leguizamo was the only one I wasn't familiar with, and he does a nice job with his voice-over. There's also good voice acting from comedians Ray Romano (Manny) and Denis Leary (Diego).<br/><br/>Since they started making full-length computer animated movies in the 90's, I've seen many that have come out over the years, and have found that some are masterpieces while others are basically average (haven't seen any terrible ones, though it takes a lot to make a movie terrible to me). Like a number of others I've seen, this one comes somewhere in between, but fortunately comes closer to the former. I guess I can see why this 2002 release doesn't have appeal as wide as several Pixar efforts do, but can also see why it is quite popular nonetheless. ""Ice Age"" was a good way for Blue Sky Studios to make their feature-length debut, and they have since gone on to do more good stuff. This movie has a simple but effective plot, plus a lot more to entertain viewers of different ages, making it another example of good family entertainment. Regardless of your age, if you like computer animation, this particular film probably isn't one to miss."

","Ice Age is a very funny movie. This is one of the best animations ever. Even after I saw this film nearly 20 times, I still laugh hard which is not very often for a lot of comedies. This story is about a shrewd woolly mammoth, a dumb sloth, and a baby-hungry saber toothed tiger trying to return a lost baby to its tribe before a pack of tigers ambush the baby and the gang. The acting in the film is great. Ray Romano and John Leguizamo were hilarious as their parts. Denis Leary as Diego is good too. I liked the music in this film.

"GSmith9072","5","1","2","18 January 2007"," It's average...and immoral
","Maybe a bit below. For me, ""Ice Age"" is what defined the decline of inventive story-telling in the new cgi era. I remember seeing this in theaters. I was thrilled to see it because I was mentally inclined to think that cgi = greatness thanks to the likes of Pixar. Aside from the incorporation of several ""Scrat"" sequences, the film was average average average. I had the thought process of the film fully envisioned in my head after viewing it. The creators needed a unique environment with some animals and chose the ice age. They then invented a very 'Shrek'-esque formula: a tetchy large protagonist is accompanied by a underdog who for no apparent reason insists on joining in on the journey to complete the task that is the conflict of the film. It is however less inspired than ""Shrek"" and the laughs are more sporadic. Well, for me anyway. I must admit that the audience is always driven to giggles over the annoying 'sabre tooth' squirrel thing that suffers in his many pursuits for nuts. I hate it, it's a Looney Tunes rehash. But if the crowd likes, fine. That is actually a merit for the film. The other characters, ""Manny"", ""Sid"" and ""Diego"" are average characters when it comes to personality. Diego is the soon-to-be-redeemed for his evil meat eating ways (as long as he's not human) character who will learn to befriend the annoying sloth and the stubborn Mammoth. Manny will learn to love and respect the small child that falls into his care despite the fact that the child will grow to cause the extinction of Manny's species. Too bad he can't learn to respect the tigers for attempting, like the humans, to live. Nope, the tigers are evil demons. Moving on.<br/><br/>Sid is the irritating sidekick. Dorry, Donkey, Mike from ""Monster's Inc"" all come to mind, although most likely it wasn't plagiarized from any of those. He did garner the most laughs aside from ""Scrat"", the infamous squirrel and his nut. The story overall is not very interesting or creative. Some animals find a human child and must return it, finding laughter along the way. The attention is gained from the character's antics (which many have grown to love). If you aren't interested in the characters you'd hate the movie. The overall theme of the film is that meat-eaters should give up meat and magically live while befriending the prey. Also, that animals are reprehensible for causing any kind of discrepancies to the human race in an effort to not be killed for their fur, and that the animals should deal with it. Indeed, a watermelon is ""hilariously"" stolen from some dodo birds for the human and we laugh at the stupid soon-to-be-extinct birds as our heroes effectively steal from them. The film epitomizes the formulaic talking animal genre, for the most part, but the main problem is that it relies on the gimmicks on the comedy and it isn't gut-wrenchingly funny. I had a hard time laughing at the screwed morality. Luckily, as usual, I was the only one who noticed it. What I have left to review is the animation, which for the time was adequate. The film is average, and it needs to get it's problems with the food chain settled out. It caused Ebert to give thumbs up to Disney's ""The Wild"" for paying heed to this issue."

"basrutten","5","1","2","28 March 2006"," Hit and miss animation
","Back in 2002, animation movies were really becoming hugely popular, so it's no surprise that Fox decided to jump on the bandwagon with their first real effort at a CGI movie. The result, ""Ice Age"", is watchable but certainly no match for the Pixar and Dreamworks competition.<br/><br/>To start with the good things, all the scenes involving the frantic squirrel/rat (""Skrat"") character trying to hide his nuts everywhere are simply great. The same is true for the part involving the hilariously stupid and suicidal dodos.<br/><br/>As for real laughs, that's about it though. There are some occasionally funny bits, but for the most part ""Ice Age"" is too predictable and repetitive to be really funny. The constant bickering between the main characters gets old really fast, and the Sloth character in particular often crosses the line between funny and just downright annoying.<br/><br/>Don't expect anything from the story or the characterization either. I don't mind that the plot is predictable (let's face it, most animation movies have similar plots) but it's so sickeningly cute and delivered in such a pedestrian, play-it-safe manner that it should really appeal to kids only. The characters also left me completely cold, other than that I felt sorry for Skrat.<br/><br/>As for the animation itself, I have to say in general that it's below par, even by 2002 standards. This might have been intentional and for the most part the overly cartoony style works reasonably well, but don't expect to marvel at the visuals.<br/><br/>In the end, I'd have to say Ice Age is still watchable. I didn't care much for the fairly dull characters and the overly cute and basic plot but there are enough funny bits to mostly make up for that.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"

","They're an odd team, so they have problems; yet, after a while, they belong and learn about themselves. Yeah, that old chestnut. Then there's the other chestnut (or acorn) which provides us with what is the best that this has to offer. Sadly, the greatest sequence is indeed the utterly irrelevant epilogue (though it is of course wisely placed in the end). The whole has a half-baked air to it, thanks and no thanks in part to the animation.<br/><br/>Sure, it was aimed at kids, but even they deserve better.<br/><br/>One of the low-points of the film perfectly represents the rest of the writing and voicing (animation-wise and movement-wise, the moment is better): the ""shlalom"" exclamation (whether semi-improvised or not). Leguizamo, who reportedly didn't quite know how to voice Sid at first, decided to go with a lisp. How hilarious, the sloth's got a lisp. Ray Romano fails as well, but in the opposite way. These aren't total failures, but even if they were, the almost witless dialogue would still be the same. (Unfortunately, I can only discuss the English voicing, but perhaps I'll update this if I for some reason feel the need to see this for the third time.)<br/><br/>There's pseudo-energy, which is bad.<br/><br/>In addition to the at-times grotesque-looking fauna (the female sloths look almost as disturbing as that lass next door, and that, I'm telling you, is saying something), the humans look atrocious, as I'm sure you already know. The surfaces, too, are too artificial-looking, which becomes apparent because the landscapes are, and had to be, so vast and, you know, monotonous. (So much so that they rival Romano's voice. Drums.) The film does, I must admit, look very nice at times. In fact, the water looks too nice in these surroundings.<br/><br/>I know it seems as if I despised the film, but such is not the case. This does not make me want to pay for the upcoming sequel, but there's good to it. It's concise, and there's still the occasional good quip in the dialogue and the occasional lively moment in the animation. All the recycling is quite competently realised, which saves this from being a complete failure. Come to think of it, it's only a minor failure, a routine effort. Could've done without the obligatory montage sequence to a bad song, though."

","After an attack by a pack of saber-toothed cats (Soto, the leader, with Diego, Zeke and another) a camp of Neanderthal humans try to protect their women and children. Jumping into a raging river with her baby, one woman is dragged downstream. She manages to place the infant on an embankment but is too drained to climb out of the water herself. Soto orders Diego to find the baby and bring it to him alive. Meanwhile the animals are all trying to avoid the coming ice age by retreating to warmer climates. Left by his family, Sid, a clumsy Sloth, is rescued from two rhinoceroses by Manfred, one of the last remaining mammoths. Not wanting to be alone Sid follows Manfred, much to the mammoth's annoyance. Sid and Manfred spot the baby on the side of the river and decide to return it to its tribe, but when they get there the humans have already left. Diego, still trying to pinch the baby, convinces the pair that he knows where the humans are going and begins leading Sid and Manfred to find them. Over the course of their adventures Diego realizes that it would be wrong to harm the child and works with Sid and Manfred to return it to the tribe. At one point he even fights off his former pack. Eventually finding the humans, the trio return the child and say an emotional goodbye to the baby they had gotten somewhat attached to. A subplot involving Scrat, a sabre-toothed prehistoric squirrel who defends his beloved acorn with paranoid fervor, is continued in the follow-up short film ""Gone Nutty"".

And that's for one reason.<br/><br/>Ice Age has one main thing going for it and that's ""the cute factor"". In fact the adorable factor! Be prepared, people who may not have seen this, if you are an animal lover, you will find many friends here. I think part of the reason Ice Age was made was to make the viewer melt a little at all the cute little animals scampering across the screen. And yes it worked. On me anyway.<br/><br/>Ice Age is NOT a movie I enjoyed strongly but it is a movie that pushed all the right buttons for me in terms of the cute factor. The plot does take awhile to get going. During the first half, I wanted to go to sleep. During the second half, I wanted to hug all the characters. They all reach out and draw you in on their wintery journey, particularly Diego (and that darn squirrel!!).Another positive is that the movie, blissfully, does not wear out it's welcome because it's rather short and doesn't go on and on and on. <br/><br/>Ice Age is not a movie I'd watch over and over again, it's a little dull at times and is not in the league of a Shrek, but it is perfect when one is exhausted and just wants to lose themselves in cuteness.

They're all uniquely lovable & you root for them to succeed. The animation itself is awe inspiring. I especially liked the cave painting sequence, Scrat's intro & the lava bridge. There are some real tear jerker moments & others of pure comedy. The supporting characters, especially the rhinos & dodos, flesh out the story nicely. There's no offensive humour & is clearly aimed to entertain, whatever your age. The soundtrack was unfortunately not released but that's great too. The casting couldn't be better. I look forward to the sequel. 10/10"

","Ice Age was OK, but the story wasn't as good as Monster's Inc.  Plus, it wasn't as funny and the animation wasn't as good.  Ice Age wasn't as original as Monster's Inc or Toy Story.  It's about a mammoth, a sloth, and a sabertooth tiger, who all come together to take a baby back to its dad. Predictably, the bad guy, Diego the tiger, becomes friends with his companions and helps them escape the tiger ambush.  The best character was Sid the Sloth.

","Probably the best animated feature film I've seen. The animation is astounding. The expression of the characters through their movement and faces is amazing. Definitely the best out of everything I've seen before. So realistic. It's the subtlety that does it. <br/><br/>The story is a relatively straight-forward adventure/return to home type thing. What makes this stand above other films of this type is the interaction between the characters. Using animals means that they can be physically very different from one another alongside their personality differences, and this works very well indeed. There's some great humour in there and some really touching moments as the main characters overcome their differences and bond into their herd.<br/><br/>I really can't fault it. I'd recommend it to anybody. I just hope that they make a sequel."

","Ice Age is the next amusing chapter in the computer-animated family film genre.  Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say it is a rehash of the previous chapters.  It is certainly a fun film, with witty word play and some exciting action sequences, including an ice-slide ride which every child (and probably most adults too) would love to try out.  But one can't help feeling that the story is a little tired through previous overuse.  A group of unlikely acquaintances - this time comprised of a mammoth, a sloth and a sabre-toothed tiger - set out on a quest to return the obligatory lost-but-cute child to his family.<br/><br/>The animation is adequate, but nowhere near the high standard set by Monsters, Inc.  This is particularly noticeable with regards to the various animals' fur, which is disappointingly static.  Additionally the background landscapes are very basic and the snow is somehow just too pristine.  Having said that however, the film does have some nice attention to detail, such as the eye tic in Scrat - the acorn-obsessed and incredibly unlucky squirrel. The misadventures of Scrat are the best parts of the movie, and made more impressive by the fact that, as he doesn't speak a single word of dialogue, the humour is entirely visual. <br/><br/>There are also nice character touches evident in Manny the mammoth (who has amazingly emotive eyes), and a sequence in which a cave painting comes alive and depicts a tragic scene from his past is very effective.  While an emotional sequence like this gives the movie a heart, its descent at the finale into saccharine sentimentality is somewhat cloying, but will probably satisfy the kids (and anyone else who requires a film to have a happy ending)."

","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>A+ for animation, the humans looked human, loved the look and feel.<br/><br/>
However, if you want a story about a mis-understood giant and an annoying small sidekick, you would be better off watching _Shrek (2001)_. Everytime I would see a scene that was suppposed to be funny, I would think ""This is just like Shrek, only, different somehow, oh yes, not as funny"".  The one true original scene was the ice cave sequence.  Everything else was a stereotypical mishmash of animation cliches.  Oh look, the psuedo-villian has a last-second change of heart (Emperor's New Groove).  Oh look, a lake of lava, never seen that before (Shrek).  Oh look, creatures stuck with a baby and hilarious antics ensue (Monsters Inc).<br/><br/>Seems like the animators had some cool technology to show off and simply cut and paste a plot together.  I mean, don't get me wrong, there are broad elements common to almost all movies/stories, however, it seemed that Ice Age went out of its way to simply reuse other bits of movies, without giving it a personal touch/ new spin.  What a shame.  Great cast though."

While the technology is impressive as seen in the remarkable fire, moving water and smoke filled scenes, the technology is used sparingly which is good as it lets the story shine and it does. In addition to a neat and clever story the voices of the characters fit and the plot really books avoiding getting bogged in songs that don't further the plot [like some of Don Bluth's epics].I have not yet seen the special DVD features, but I did watch the film twice on our first showing on DVD.

Even the drawing style had a certain skewed idiosyncracy that was enjoyable. <br/><br/>And the required-by-law tearjerking heartstring-pulling scene was done with a subtlety, delicacy and tastefulness that was nothing short of great, in addition to passing over the heads of the tiniest audience members so as not to give them existential angst beyond their ability to handle.<br/><br/>Really well done.

","""Ice Age"" is one of the most mixed and uneven movies I've seen in a long time. Overall it was ""OK."" There were wonderful aspects-- and some really bad aspects. The mammoth and the sloth, for example, were amazing bits of animation. The water at the end of the movie was also marvelous. Some of the scenes, though, were cheesey rip-offs of way better films. Note the similarity between the mountain cave passages in ""Ice Age"" and the flying whale scene in Disney's ""Fantasia 2000."" The flying whales, and the whole trapped under the iceberg thing--- was enchanting, evocative, uplifting, and a masterpiece. The rip-off version in ""Ice Age"" by contrast seems dim, depressing, and dreary.<br/><br/>Much of ""Ice Age"" resembled the frenetic and abbreviated desert scenes of the later, crappier, Road Runner cartoons. I saw ""Ice Age"" in a small town full of ordinary people. The audience at my showing was a mix of small and medium kids and their parents. There were a few moments of ""Ooooh!"" and a few quiet chuckles. One or two kids guffawed every time an animal stepped on a stick and got hit in the face. Otherwise, the theater was pretty quiet. I think we were all waiting for the cool part to start, when all of a sudden, the movie was over.<br/><br/>Referring again to the moments of goodness-- the tigers looked awful, but Dang! The mammoth and the sloth looked great. Their fur was so well done! But if it weren't for their great looking fur, this movie could probably have gone straight to video.<br/><br/>Take the kids! Take the grandparents. But to keep from boring yourself into a stupor, get drunk first (but don't drink and drive, take a taxi!)."

The more negative note goes to Sid, an unpleasantly greenish sloth, which associates a grotesque aspect to an endless collection of stupid moments. Unfortunately, this creature is the largest attempt to make this movie something funny. The intelligent humor of other characters works better, making more digestible a film that, without it, it would be quite silly.

","'Toy Story' is widely acclaimed for being the first film to rely entirely on computer animation; but in fact, it also had qualities that make it quite special among animated films. The ploy about obsolesce - a thinly disguised metaphor for human death - was amazingly dark for a ""childrens'"" film. The humour - centred on a toy spaceman who thinks he's a real spaceman - was incredibly sophisticated. And the metaphysic was entirely consistent throughout: every action the toys undertook was entirely in character, which meant that an adult could stay engaged throughout it's feature length. Many computer-animated movies since then have received similar rave reviews, but they haven't possessed these special qualities - and 'Ice Age' has none of them, just a bunch of annoying comedy animals and a by-numbers, episodic plot. There are other features of this film that also seem strange: the absence of any significant female characters, for example, and the unhappy contrast between the nicely rendered central characters and the static backdrops - it's like watching an old film where (human) actors pose in front of painted cardboard. It's also very strange to make the hero a hyperactive sloth with no slothful characterises at all. The best animated films have the same qualities as the best non-animated films, but I didn't find them in this film. And if you really want to watch a film where dinosaurs and humans roam the earth simultaneously, 'One Million Years B.C.' was actually more fun"
"jboothmillard","5","1","3","9 September 2005"," Ice Age
","This was the first computer-animated film to be released by 20th Century Fox and Blue Sky Studios, and led to films like Robots, Rio, and Ferdinand. I watched it several times when I was younger, it was a box office success, so it was inevitable that a franchise of sequels would follow, directed by Chris Wedge (Robots, Monster Trucks). Basically, it opens with a sabre-toothed squirrel known as Scrat (Chris Wedge) trying to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. In doing so, he inadvertently causes a crack in the ice, setting off a large avalanche, which he barely escapes. At the same time, a herd of prehistoric animals are migrating south to escape the forthcoming ice age. While a gruff woolly mammoth named Manfred aka ""Manny"" (Ray Romano) is heading north. Sid (John Leguizamo), a clumsy ground sloth, has been left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself. He inadvertently angers two Brontotheres, Carl (voice) and Frank (Stephen Root), after ruining their meal. Manny fights the rhinos after thy try to attack and continues on his path. Sid follows him, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanour and wishes to migrate alone, nevertheless Sid continues to follow him. Meanwhile, Soto (Goran Visnjic), the leader of a Smilodon pack aka sabretooth tigers, wants revenge on a neanderthal tribe for killing half of his pack by killing the chief's infant son. Soto leads a raid on the neanderthal camp, during which the baby's mother is cornered by Soto's lieutenant, Diego (Denis Leary), until she jumps down a waterfall. Soto orders Diego to find and retrieve the baby while the rest of the pack will wait for him at the mountain known as Half-Peak. Later, Sid and Manny encounter the mother in the river. In her dying moments she rests the baby on a rock for Manny to take, before disappearing into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but the camp has been deserted. They meet Diego, who claims he wanted to help the child, he convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the tribe. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to Half-Peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them. On the way, they must change the baby, get into a squabble for a melon for the baby with a flock of dodo birds, encounter the Brontotheres once again, and enter an ice cavern. Scrat also pops up along the way still trying to find a place to keep his beloved acorn. Following these misadventures, the group reaches a cave with several cave paintings. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with neanderthal hunters; they slaughtered his family, consisting of his mate and child, leaving Manny a depressed loner. Before reaching Half-Peak, they encounter a forming river of lava. While Sid and the baby get safely across, Diego almost falls, but Manny saves him, narrowly missing death himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and the baby takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who is having a change of heart after his time with Manny and Sid. The next day, the herd approaches the mountain, but Diego changes his mind and confesses to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego asks for their trust and wants to help them escape attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, and guard the baby from harm, but Soto and his associates Zeke (Jack Black) and Oscar (Diedrich Bader) manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall and impale Soto, killing him instantly. The rest of the pack retreat in fear. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego, believing his injury is fatal, and go on without him. The two manage to successfully return the baby to his tribe, the father Runar bestows a beaded necklace to Manny in thanks. As the tribe walk away, Diego reunites with Sid and Manny, and they head off to warmer climates. 20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, washes up on the shores of a tropical island. The ice slowly melts, and the acorn falls out, but Scrat cannot get himself out in time to rescue it from being washed away. Scrat then finds a coconut and tries to stomp it into the ground, he ends up accidentally triggering a volcanic eruption. Also starring Alan Tudyk as Lenny / Oscar / Dab, Lorri Bagley as Jennifer, and Jane Krakowski as Rachel. The voices of Romano, Leguizamo and Leary are suited for their characters who banter well together, I agree it is not the most exciting film, but it has fun and amusing moments that will entertain kids and adults alike, it is an alright family animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. Worth watching!"

Along the way, this unique herd will bond as they face countless difficulties.<br/><br/>As far as animation styles go, this film isn't that bad. Feeling distinctly out of place in comparison with more modern effects, it returns to an older style where animals were realistic, and humans were irrelevant. While humans might look distinctly block based however, scenes involving ice and steam are treated with incredible detail and look remarkably realistic.<br/><br/>Humour in ""Ice Age"" is also just as inconsistent as the animation. A scene involving a huge number of Dodo saving for the winter is perhaps one of the funniest scenes to come out of animation since the turn of the 21st century. Simultaneously though, the ongoing joke about Sid's annoyance is quick to loose steam and by the end of the film, you find yourself more agitated than amused.<br/><br/>Another flaw with ""Ice Age"" is a bad choice of casting. Sometimes the best thing about watching a cartoon is working out who does what voice. In ""Shrek"" and it's sequel, there was a ridiculous amount of star voices present. In more minor films like ""Robots"", there are less, but they are still distinctive. In ""Ice Age"" however, with the exception of the always noticeable tones of Denis Leary, very few voices are identifiable. In America, perhaps the voice of Ray Romano might be known for ""I Love Raymond"", but in Britain where the show never caught on, the name is a complete unknown and is unidentifiable.<br/><br/>For an animation to be successful, it generally has to be funny, well made and with a cast of familiar voices. With moments of hilarity and some equally impressive animation, ""Ice Age"" does make some headway. Unfortunately though it is far too inconsistent and too lacking in the vocal front. A laugh to watch when there is nothing else to do, but it's best not to set your expectations too high."
"zaayrdragon","6","1","3","2 April 2004"," Ugly version of Monsters, Inc.
","***WARNING:  MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Just saw this one tonight for the first time... and I gotta say, although it had its moments, Ice Age seemed a little too much like a very ugly Monsters, Inc.  John L's sloth was utterly unloveable, and I cringed through most of his lines.  The mammoth had one, and ONLY one, shining moment - when he saw the paintings in the cavern.  The sabretooth was at least a good character, but had such a small role, really.  And Pinky/Lumpy wasn't HALF as cute as Boo.  Plus, the animation was really second-rate (compared to MI), the plot was methodical and predictable, and most of the humour fell flat. <br/><br/>
On the up side, this movie had much more death (implied, not shown) than most Pixar creations, so I'd say it's much more mature and therefore earns an extra point.<br/><br/>If this film had one truly redeemable quality, it'd be that darned squirrel. Add about another four segments with HIM, and this movie would have been a hoot.  As it is, I rate Ice Age slightly better than average, 6/10."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","3","12 December 2003"," A great film for children and adults, but they needed more of that squirrel!
","Ice Age is a visually stunning animated feature that takes after Shrek in that it is wisely aimed toward adults just as much as children - an important detail the oversight of which just about single-handedly caused the failure of Cats & Dogs. It is structured unfortunately like a birthday cake, in that the candy frosting is at the very beginning and then the actual body of the film, the cake, bears much less of an immediate appeal but is still willingly consumed.<br/><br/>The spectacular opening sequence in the film is probably the most recognizable part of the film since it is what makes up the majority of the theatrical trailers. By far the most entertaining part of the film, it introduces a lowly squirrel (lowly in that it is one of the few animals in the film that doesn't speak) that makes occasional and very welcome appearances throughout the rest of the film. After this opening sequence (which easily surpasses the opening sequence of any James Bond film), we are quickly introduced to an accident prone sloth named Sid, who is saved from a couple of angry rhinos by a caring mammoth (Manfred) who would just as soon save his life and never be seen with him again. They become a grudging partnership when they come across a human baby, as their care of life itself overcomes Manfred's dislike of Sid and his desire to be left alone.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed that this was going to be yet another animated movie with talking animals (seriously, do we not already have enough of these?) the way I was with Dinosaur in 2000, but for the most part, Ice Age manages to avoid being a routine animated talking animal movie. There is a curious interaction between animals that clearly do not belong together, given their random places on the food chain. Sid sticks with Manfred because Manfred is huge and scary and able to protect Sid from the threat of predators if he can only convince him to let him tag along. Sid does this, even though this is obviously not a symbiotic relationship, and then ultimately they are joined by a sabertooth tiger, of all things, who they trust only because he claims to know a shorter way to get to the humans and return the baby, and also because he alone is not much of a threat to Manfred.<br/><br/>(spoilers) The place where this film graciously strays from the routine talking animal movie is where the subject of good and evil in the film is concerned. It is no secret that Diego (the sabertooth, voiced brilliantly by Denis Leary) is a vicious predator with little on his mind other than obtaining this baby for his pack for revenge purposes and, as an added bonus, tricking Manfred into walking into a trap and feeding his whole pack of tigers with his abundance of meat. This develops a wonderful situation in that we never know what is going to happen and who to trust, and even this involving story is intercut with things like the thrilling ice-slide scene (which mirrors the sheer thrills created by the door factory scene in Monster, Inc., arguably the best scene in the film), and blanketed by the breathtaking animation first introduced in a mainstream film with Toy Story in 1995.<br/><br/>There is, however, a rather unfortunate quality to the mixing of the characters here, in that it so effectively portrays the carnivores as the bad guys, the evil part of the necessary good and evil ingredients in order to have a story. Also like Cats & Dogs (which chose to impose the characteristic of evil onto one of the two breeds of rivals seemingly at random), this film chooses to present the carnivores as the evil ones, but at least the reasoning is apparent here. The sabertooth tigers are meat-eaters, they kill other animals for food (and talking animals at that!), so clearly they have to be presented as the antagonists. Never mind the fact that humans are much more vicious and violent predators than sabertooth tigers, right? Newsflash, vegetarians, if you only want to eat things that were never alive, I hope you can get used to a diet of sand and rocks, because that is just about all that's going to be on the menu.<br/><br/>Just kidding, I actually applaud people who make restrictions in their diets because of the things that go on in slaughterhouses. Killing animals for human food is one of the least supervised industries in the world by the animal rights groups, and these practices sicken me to no end (although have little to no impact on my own gleeful consumption of meat), but I hardly think this is an adequate reason to portray sabertooth tigers, who are doing nothing more than following their natural instincts, as evil because of their longing for such a large quantity of meat as Manfred would provide them.<br/><br/>The end of Ice Age is the point where the movie comes dangerously close to being overly sentimental and cheesy, given the tearful antics that go on when the baby is returned to the humans. Sid and Manfred give their teary goodbyes just as Diego staggers over the horizon (assuring us that he is not really dead), to do a little peek-a-boo at the baby and then give a little wave. This is cheesy crap, but the rest of the movie is good enough to allow for a little over-sentimentality like this.<br/><br/>The best things about Ice Age were things like the rearrangement of the food chain in the partnership that develops throughout the film, the sheer comedy involved in the squirrel's unending efforts to stow away acorns for a winter that is already here, and the new idea of where the English language may have come from (humans don't speak!!). Despite the ham-handed message of vegetarianism that permeates the film from beginning to end (which I dislike more for its blatant ham-handedness than its presence at all), Ice Age proudly carries the distinction of being one for the whole family and not just one that the producers want you to BELIEVE is one for the whole family, as was the case with Cats & Dogs. Enjoy it, and don't sit too close to the TV."
"rosscinema","5","1","3","12 July 2003"," Predictable story
","This is the second animated feature by Twentieth Century Fox and I thought the general idea was endearing enough but it just plods along in a very predictable manner. The story of course takes place in the ice age and we see a sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo) being saved by a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and they start traveling together during the southern migration. Also, some sabertooth tigers want to get revenge on a tribe of humans and the leader of the pack decides to steal a human baby and he selects a tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) to carry out this mission. He chases the human mother until she and her baby jump into the river and disappear. She washes up down the river where Manfred and Sid find her. She dies but the baby is alive but then Diego shows up and wants the baby. Manfred and Sid say no but Diego says he can lead them to a pass in the mountains where the humans are going and they can hand the child over. But Diego is really leading them to an ambush where the other tigers will be waiting. So the journey begins and at this point in the film Diego discovers the importance of being in a herd and how you should look after one another. The story is very predictable and you can guess what is going to happen before it even happens! There really is nothing new here. A band of talking animals protecting a human baby, haven't we seen that before? Didn't that happen in ""Monsters Inc""? The animation is not overly impressive although some of the shots have some good detail. As you watch this film the animation just doesn't grab your attention. I think part of the reason is the bleak landscape. How attention grabbing is the color white? It doesn't leave a lot of room for detail. I did enjoy Ray Romano's voice for his character. His deep and slow drawl seems perfectly suited for a slow moving mammoth. Its not a bad animated film and its hard not to root for these characters no matter how hokey the story is. But the story is really aimed at a very young audience and it should work best for that mentality. But if your a teenager or older than you will easily spot how familiar the story is."

"asticht","9","1","3","10 December 2002"," A visual spectacle that is a must see
","I'll admit that when I saw the trailer for Ice Age in the theater, I thought it was extremely comical but it didn't spark my interest to go and see the movie.  Some of this reluctance is due to my love of the CG animated film Shrek.  But I wish now that I had seen this film on the big screen as it is a really magnificently done film, considering it was a first effort by Blue Sky Studios and Fox.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant and very very believable.  The animation was some of the best CG stuff that I have seen yet.  The story was well written and contained a very good and solid plot that never left the audience feeling that the movie had bogged down.  The movie contains many scenes which have double entendres and inuendos that are definitely geared for a mature audience but are so well disguised that the average young viewer is not going to pick up on them in the double meaning in which they were intended. <br/><br/>
Two very emotional and touching moments occurred in the film that were much warmer than hardly any film I have seen live action or animated in a long time.  All in all, I would have to say that this is one of the best films that I have seen come out in a long time.  <br/><br/>In addition, since I saw the film for the first time on a DVD format, I would also have to comment on the content of the DVD.  Absolutely breathtaking and in many ways as funy and entertaining as the film itself. There is even two animated short films on the DVD which in and of themselves are amazing with their fluid clean crisp CG graphics.<br/><br/>Congratulations to the animators, director, studio and producers for generating an instant classic."

The running gag of the critter trying to catch the acorn continues throughout the film and makes the movie even more enjoyable. This is one great film. Ray Romano and the other actors who do the voices are great. I have seen this movie twice already and will definitely get the DVD when it comes out tomorrow. Absolutely a delightful film, and the computer animation is excellent. This is one of the year's best films, and it comes at a time when good movies are hard to find, since Hollywood seems to enjoy making films with filthy language, grotesque violence and other things that we don't need to see in movies."

","What can I say. I just saw this film today and God, I LOVE it!! Fox people finally got the hang of it; I liked 'Anastasia' pretty much though. I don't understand why 'Ice Age' is NOT in the IMDb #200 list! This should be in it. What are you thinking, people?!? I've seen a lot of animations so far in my life and this is it. 'Shrek'? No way. 'Toy Story 2'? Close but not enough inspiration as this one has. No offense though- I basically like all well-made animations. Probably the FOX image came under a shadow. What if this was made by Disney?-while it is not possible whatsoever. They became too complacent to produce this kind of gem.<br/><br/>Anyhow,""Ice Age"" is THE first animated picture that made me laugh a hearty laugh(TRUE!) and also made me naturally sob at the end.

I can't believe that so many adults rate this highly. I'm not complaining, the animation is nice. It's perfect for kids but not really for anyone over 10. It is not comparable with any of the ""Toy Story"" movies or even Monsters Inc. to a lesser extent which all work on so many levels... for both kids and adults. Shrek blows it out of the water. Just don't bother, get it out for the kids if you want them to be distracted for 90mins or so. Otherwise just stick with Pixar!

","Why are digital animation films taking successfully over traditional animation? Because of examples like ""Toy Story"" (1&2), ""A Bug's Life"", ""Shrek"" (wonderful), ""Monsters, Inc."" and now, ""Ice Age"".<br/><br/>As the rest of listed films, the secret of this new breed of animation is found in the ORIGINALITY of the idea...ORIGINALITY-something quite difficult to find in cinema nowadays. The story told by ""Ice Age"", although simple, is perfectly narrated and very well ""juiced"" by their producers, as throughout the story you find lots of gags and scenes that could seem not essential for the story, but are excellent (the final scene, for instance) and very funny.<br/><br/>The originality of this ""Ice Age"" stands in the excellent design of both characters and scenery, and in the excellent personification of the animals we see during the movie. A special mention for the squirrel, Scrat, one of the funniest toons I've ever seen. Another interesting point is the ambition of Fox Animation to transmitt, alike Disney films, a message (in this film, sort of friendship, courage and ecologic balance between humans and nature), but not in the classic ""kiddish"" way we are so tired of watching. The thing is, here that message doesn't take over the whole plot of the story: the real ingredient is the humour the film constantly radiates, let the public enjoy a memorable film just by its ambition of being extremely funny and humorous, not by showing a kind of serious melodrama, like happened with ""The Prince Of Egypt"" and many of the last DisneyÂ´s, such as ""Pocahontas"". David Newman's music outstands: rhythmic and very playful, like the very first piece of the film, in the starting credits and the migration of animals to the south.<br/><br/>What more can I say? Many more small things and details, but the essential is summarized here. Just say this is NO film for kids and youngsters: the fame of animation of being exclusively aimed at children is finished. So important has this genre become, that even the Academy has made an exclusive Oscar for the best animation film of the year. Because thingts have changed. Just by watching the films I listed at the beginning, you'll find the answer. And ""Ice Age"" follows this new tradition of excellent and original digital animation.<br/><br/>VOTE ----> 9/10"

","Kudos to writers, Michael J. Wilson and Michael Berg, who have given us a unique and cleverly written film that will appeal to anyone over four. The story revolves around two misfit characters, a depressed giant wooly mammoth, and an obnoxious, irritating sloth who has been rejected by his family. They meet as one heads south to escape the ""ice age"" and the other is heading north to escape life. A friendship of sorts ensues and then strengthens when they find a baby boy and decide to try to find its parents. Trouble ensues when they meet up with a tiger who tags along with them under pretense of concern for the child, while secretly imagining it as breakfast. This is simply a downright funny movie, filled with clean comedy, slapstick, lots of action and the sweetness that we adore in Disney films. Some scenes are very poorly digitally mastered however, which distracts from the film, and for this reason alone I deducted a point. Despite that fact, however, this film should appeal to anyone age 4 and above, and I do recommend it as a good family outing.."
"dr_rjp","10","1","3","19 March 2002"," I loved this film!
","What I think is a testament to this animated film is the fact that I forgot it was an animated film while watching it.<br/><br/>The artwork is beautiful and captivating, but the antics and cameraderie of the cast are what take it to a higher level.  The storyline is not unique, but how many films are these days?  What is unique is how well the writer, producer, director and cast all work together.<br/><br/>Despite the superficial resemblance to ""Three Men and a Baby,"" this is a buddy film in all respects. The characters continually play off each other in subtle ways lacking in such other films as ""Monsters, Inc."" and even ""Shrek.""<br/><br/>Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, and Denis Leary work so well together that it's hard to believe this was their first, joint project.  The only flaw I found in this trio was Romano's voiceover of Manny (which was no different from his ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" character).  As plain, bland, and easily recognizable as Ray's voice was, it was more than compensated by Leguizamo's quirky-sounding Sid and Leary's cool-cat rendition of Diego.<br/><br/>From the moment the movie begins, the gags flow fast and furious, thanks to the addition of the adorable Scrat (voiceover by Director, Chris Wedge). Scrat is the Pleistocene's answer to Wile E. Coyote, but much funnier. There are other throwbacks to previous animated fare (such as Tarzan and Lion King), but, for the most part, Ice Age avoids the strictly formulaic approach to toon films that Hollywood seems to lazily adopt.  Sure, there are those intentionally sentimental moments you have come to expect in every Disney film ever made. Yet, they are not so weighty as to put a drag on the comic continuity of the film.<br/><br/>There are also moments in the film where you can see homage being paid to the great animator and gagster, Fred Avery, as when all the characters make their imprint on a snow bank as they crash into it at high speed.<br/><br/>This is a film that has something for all age groups. It has silly toon humor for the kidlets, and sly innuendoes for the adults.  I cannot wait to see it again."

"San Franciscan","10","1","3","16 March 2002"," Well, what do you know? 20th Century Fox DID it!
","I went to see ""Ice Age"" out of curiosity and boredom only. I thought, ""What the heck, let's go see it."" I didn't have terribly big hopes for it and just thought it would be merely a slightly passable hit which would be mildly successful because of the lack of animated films otherwise out in theaters at the time of this writing.<br/><br/>But what do you know? The great news is that 20th Century Fox has managed to pull a winner out of its bag on their very first outing!<br/><br/>Although the plot won't win any huge awards for originality, it's beside the point: the fun here is with the wildly zany, energetic direction that the film takes in getting from A to B. Unlike the horrendous ""Shrek"", which was basically a bunch of childish gross-out jokes attached to an extremely juvenile attempt to mock Disney (which was so limp that it ended up being the motion picture equivalent of scribbling dirty pictures and wisecracks all over a bully's photo in his high school yearbook), this one is guaranteed to appeal to ALL ages and not just those who haven't yet outgrown the buttcrack/fart stage. This is because ""Ice Age"" is written with a very adult, sly and sophisticated sense of humour that hasn't really seen much of the light of day since the original Looney Tunes creations, gags which grow out of situations and personality as well as clever animation--NOT just cheap laughs.<br/><br/>The film is blessedly free of the trendy gross outs that prevails excuses for modern family comedy today. There are only three gags here (which I won't give away) which mildly approach that area--but they work because of the attitude behind them. Let me give you an idea by saying this: the stupid gross outs in ""Shrek"" were created by people would thought that the offensive bodily actions THEMSELVES were funny. By sharp comparison, the three in this film are funny not because of what they are, but because of the identifiable situations they are PLACED in. There's a huge difference, one that frat crowds tend to be all too late to realize until they hit the emotional equivalent of puberty.<br/><br/>I'd be tempted to say that it was created as a tribute to the now-late Chuck Jones if it weren't for the fact that it's been in the works since long before his death. I say this because it pays such a huge and loving tribute to the classic WB studio. It's no coincidence that the little squirrel-like character who spends all his time trying to hide an acorn is created with a facial structure and expressions which are almost identical to Wile E. Coyote's.<br/><br/>And speaking of facial expressions...well, the ones here put ""Shrek"" to shame. They are wild, cartoony and even manage to outdo the emotions expressed in even Pixar's creations. This film KNOWS it's a computer-animated cartoon as opposed to a computer-animated ""feature film"", so it goes for broke with fantastic exaggerations that would do the Old School proud. Even its gorgeous backgrounds refuse to take themselves too seriously, sporting a cartoonish surrealism that echoes Maurice Noble.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that, as with ""Shrek"" and the Pixar films, the people STILL tend to look awfully plastic. But that's such a minor quibble concerning this film, because its only main concern is to provide audiences with the best time watching a comedy that they've seen all winter. And it succeeds terrifically.<br/><br/>Take the kids, take your parents--heck, take your grandmother. Everyone will get a kick out of this gem.<br/><br/>(NOTE: Why slap a PG rating on a film that has virtually nothing any more objectionable in it than Disney's current G-rated animated features?)"

It's a film that will make you smile along the way and maybe sniffle at the end.  This wasn't meant to be an astract masterpiece.  It was meant as a fun for all ages film and it definitely succeeds. Basic storyline of 3 mammalian misfits coming together to save a baby boy. The voice casting was perfect.  John L. is especially fitting as the clumsy sloth.  The others barely have lines.  The small rodent/squirrel is also good for some short comic relief along the way as he tries hard to bury its acorn.  It was nice to see how they kept Manny's reason for being a loner mysterious until the (almost) very end. What made this movie enjoyable for me were the fantastic job the animators did with the whole body expressions.  This is like watching a CG muppets/Sesame street.  The fur and fat undulates, muscles stretch and contract conveying a very comical feel. Manny's fur and Sid's belly were especially well done. Unfortunately, they focused so much on the animals the humans were left as an afterthought; too robotic but you don't see much of them anyway.  I also love how there were very little saccharine songs (ahem, Disney) to revolt you.  It's wonderful to see how well CG (and people talent) is coming along.  This presents a much more level playing field for the movie studios.  Disney definitely doesn't own this joint which is a great thing since their stuff has been uninspired of late. I can easily (and heartily) recommend this film seeing as how the competition the last 4 weeks have been utter garbage.  So go on, watch it and bring the kids!"
"Figaro-8","10","1","3","15 March 2002"," Cool ICE AGE gets a warm reception.
","Fox has had a hard time with animated features.  ANASTASIA did moderately well; TITAN AE did not.  But with ICE AGE, they may finally have their foot firmly in the door.<br/><br/>The animation:  Okay, maybe Blue Sky won't dethrone Pixar or PDI anytime soon.  But make no mistake, ICE AGE is a visual marvel still.  It fits the story perfectly:  alternately cartoonish and detailed when it needs to be. (It's not ALWAYS necessary to see every strand of hair on a creature's body.)<br/><br/>Voices and characters:  One of the best things about the film.  The characters are quite memorable, and the vocal performances are great. Others have objected to Ray Romano's performance as Manfred the mammoth, but I felt that his deadpan delivery was just right to portray the strong, yet emotionally wounded loner.  Denis Leary makes Diego a cool cat, whether he's bad or good.  But the best vocal performance goes to John Leguizamo, who is simply hilarious as Sid.  He makes Sid immediately endearing rather than irritating.<br/><br/>And then there's Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel whose antics with an acorn open, close, and serve as the transitional elements of the film. He's a miniature Wile E. Coyote to his acorn's Road Runner.  You know he's gonna get it, but you just gotta cheer for--and laugh at--the guy.<br/><br/>But the success of a film ultimately comes down to its script.  The trailers make this film out to be hilarious, and it is.  But what a nice surprise to find out there is more to it than mere comedy.  It's a testament to the talents of director Chris Wedge and the writers that you will laugh hard one minute and have a tear in your eye the next.  They also know when dialogue is not needed, which is commendable.<br/><br/>ICE AGE has the potential to be a big hit.  It's got one of the best ad campaigns in years, no Disney competition on opening weekend, and on top of that, it has a solid story with endearing characters.  I hope it will be a film for the ages."

","I thought that Ice Age would be just like other animated films like Toy Story or Monsters Inc., but it turned out to be quite a lot different. The characters were very lovable, especially Sid, with his lisping and ignorance. Manfred had an attitude that matched his size, but as the movie went on, he turned out to be quite a softie inside. Diego at first was leading the other two and the baby into a trap, but changed his mind after Manfred risked his own life to save him. The characters seem very true to life.

"Cylex","10","1","3","19 April 2002"," Roshan & his tribe are good too.
","Since this is my favourite animation I'm going to comment on it again.<br/><br/>
Although the animals have more screen impact than the humans, this does not mean Roshan & his tribe are badly done. On the contrary I liked the way they were animated. Several people have remarked that they are unrealistic but I don't see the problem. Photo realism is not what I'm looking for in animation. In any case they look better than the humans in Toy Story.<br/><br/>Roshan is cute and I love watching him interact with Sid, Manny & Diego. Sid falls for him immediately and they treat each other like siblings, sometimes fighting, sometimes just having fun. Manny is like a grumpy uncle at first but is soon won over by the baby's charms. The scene where Roshan hugs him is adorable. Even Diego gradually weakens. It is these relationships that make the film such a success.<br/><br/>Roshan's parents and tribe only have a small part to play, but an important one too. The ending is beautifully done and no one can fail to be moved. It's just a shame that such a magnificent film wasn't longer. (The same is true for The Land Before Time.

"SwingBatta","10","1","3","2 April 2002"," Heartwarming, comical ""Ice"" is one for the ages
","""Ice Age,"" which could have been alternatively titled ""Three Mammals and a Baby,"" is the smartest and most entertaining animated movie since 2000's ""Chicken Run."" It's an intellectual winner that will prove gratifying for both children and adults, and it's the first great film of a year otherwise marred by rubbish like ""All About the Benjamins"" and ""Resident Evil."" There's just something about small-studio-produced, anthropomorphized animals that does the trick every time.<br/><br/>Then again, considering my name, I probably would've been hard-pressed to dislike this movie in the first place.<br/><br/>Manfred, a huge, aloof woolly mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano), is clearly uninterested in tagging along with an assembly of prehistoric creatures who are migrating south to escape the oncoming Ice Age. Before he knows it, he is thrust into an unexpected and unwelcome position of playing bodyguard to a good-natured yet incompetent sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), when the latter angers a pair of rhinos after inadvertently ruining their dinner in a most unpleasant manner. Meanwhile, Diego (Denis Leary), a revenge-minded sabertooth tiger, has the task of kidnapping a human baby from a tribe who have killed and reduced his pack to the brink of extinction, but his plan of attack fails and the baby disappears from the fracas. Later, Manfred and Sid are shocked to see this little pink thing wash up at their feet on a riverbank, still alive. Though distrustful of one another, the threesome reluctantly put their agendas aside and join forces in order to try to return the child to his family. It's a race against time as they try to succeed in their quest before the Ice Age destroys them all.<br/><br/>
Considering that this is a computer-generated film, there's no element of surprise in the animation. But ""Ice Age,"" directed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha, has something that sets it apart from its brethren. It's oddly reminiscent of the immortal Looney Tunes cartoons, due to its old-school slapstick. Throughout the picture, a feisty little critter named Scrat (so called because he's part squirrel and part rat) tries constantly in vain to bury his beloved acorn. His first attempt - pounding it into solid ice - sets off one heck of an avalanche. Scrat's continuous failed attempts to bury that darned acorn resemble Wile E. Coyote's vain pursuits of the Roadrunner. The aforementioned avalanche scene, in which two icy mountain ranges collide with each other and nearly crush our diminutive protagonist, is a blast. The resulting ""uh-oh"" expression on his little face, upon realizing his grave mistake, is priceless; you almost expect him to whip out that tiny umbrella and cower beneath it. (He also features in a hilarious tag scene at the film's conclusion.) When characters go flying into a snowbank, they leave their silhouette-shaped imprints in their wake. Diego and Manfred continuously knock Sid on the noggin simply for the baby's amusement. ""Ice Age"" even contains a unique and spectacular take on the chase scene, courtesy of what looks like a frozen waterslide hidden deep in a cave.<br/><br/>As was the case with ""Chicken Run,"" this film's centerpiece is its superb voice acting. With a trio of venerable comedians cast in the leading roles, the chance was there for them to ham it up and try to outdo each other. Instead, their performances are considerably restrained and they mesh together well, resulting in near-impeccable comic timing. Romano brings the right touch of endearing grouchiness as Manfred, but without becoming a completely miserable sourpuss. Leguizamo's high-pitched voice, coupled with a Cindy Brady-type lisp, is perfect for the cowardly and lovable Sid, while Leary, one of the greatest - and most ribald - stand-up comics ever, is all easygoing attitude as shady Diego, who may or may not have something to hide. Their voices fit the characters in the tradition of Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny or Elmer Fudd; it's hard to imagine anyone else in these roles.<br/><br/>It doesn't hurt that their bestial counterparts are so darn cute and well developed either. Sure, Diego's mission is to abduct the baby and bring him to the leader of his pack (voiced by Goran Visnjic), but viewers will discover that it's near impossible to feel any animosity towards him. His character is hurt slightly by predictability, but that doesn't make him any less enjoyable. Manfred is pretty much a Neanderthal Lou Grant in terms of his take on the familiar surly-on-the-outside and soft-on-the-inside disposition, but he doesn't whine constantly about it. He doesn't expect anyone's sympathy. The oddly proportioned Sid steals the show, from his funny backside-swinging strut to his personality as a timid little sloth with a heart of gold; no one is more dedicated to returning the baby safely back to his home. There is a hysterical scene where poor Sid sits in the pouring rain while trying futilely to build a fire, or when he entertains some girlfriends in a prehistoric Jacuzzi (in this case, a tar pit). But while ""Ice Age"" succeeds at tickling the funny bone, it's not all mindless fun and games. There is one emotional moment when our three heroes look at a series of cave paintings, including one featuring a mammoth family - mother, father, and child - which transforms into a beautifully animated yet melancholy sequence showing a horrible human slaughter of the family, as seen through Manfred's perspective. He feels a spiritual connection to the baby after the death of his own. Not since Gandalf's demise in ""Lord of the Rings"" have I teared up during a movie, which, needless to say, is something I don't do very often. It's a rarity when a film causes viewers to believably experience different emotions without feeling forced to do so.<br/><br/>""Ice Age"" succeeds in various ways where ""Shrek,"" to which it has drawn many comparisons to, fails. How remarkable is this film? It may mark the first time that the toilet humor contains actual humor. The stiff partnership between Manfred and Sid is parallel to the relationship between Shrek and Donkey, only it's much more amusing. There's no juvenile or crude humor, nor are there any unnecessary potshots aimed at its competition or hypocritical morals preached to the audience, such as the rampant don't-judge-someone-until-you-know-them ethics in ""Shrek"" that were wedged in between the short jokes. The film's only real weakness is an insignificant sequence involving an army of dodo birds, but it's no more abhorrent than watching frogs and snakes being grossly inflated into balloon animals. And, there are no bloody ""Matrix"" spoofs to be seen anywhere.<br/><br/>After a string of disappointments like ""Anastasia"" and ""Titan A.E.,"" Fox's beleaguered animation department has finally broken the jinx with this comic delight, and you can do likewise with ""Ice Age"" if you've already lost hope for the 2002 movie season. 9/10"

"thousandisland","10","1","3","2 April 2002"," Excellent.
","Ice Age is a wonderful film.  The main characters are so lovable and developed (a rarity in film these days.) that you can't help but be engaged and totally absorbed in their adventures.  The key to good film isn't plot, story or effects.  It isn't even good animation.  It's CHARACTER, and this film's got that in spades.  There are also deep and emotional messages about family and friendship, morality and betrayal.  Contrary to what you may read in some reviews, this film is not for little kids.  It is totally adult in feel and execution, full of maturity and perspective.   The humor is a great touch, even the ""poop"" humor, because it is dealt with in a sophisticated, adult way, not a Shrek-Ohh!-Someone farted!-That's so FUNNY!-way.  I would know because I HATE childish ""humor"" like that. Movies like Dr. Dolittle 2 make me want to walk out. It ISN'T funny.  It is just stupid and talks down to the audience as though we're all fourth graders.  What IS funny is three Prehistoric beasts arguing about who is going to look at the ""baby thing"" the baby is wearing and be the ""poop checker""... These are adult animals having to deal with a human baby, and that is just plain funny, especially when they conclude from it that ""humans are disgusting.""   To put a scene like this even NEAR the immaturity of Shrek's is unbelievable.   One is realistic and reflective, the other is just rubbish from some writer with a six year-old mentality.     ""Ice Age"" is light years beyond Shrek in its approach to real themes like death, loss and sacrifice, and all of it is carried off with perfect results.  There are a couple of very brief moments where the emotion is excessive, but it is so meaningful that this is hardly a complaint.   The story is wonderful and, unlike other great films like The Lion King, the quality of the humor and emotion is uniform to the very end.  I love this film because it is full of terrific dialogue.. The characters discuss everything with absolute honesty and realism, which rounds out all their personalities and provides lots of humor.  I went into this movie thinking it was going to be awful-- (Hearing things like, ""If you liked Shrek, you'll love Ice Age"" only confirmed my dread.)  I couldn't have been more wrong.  Ice Age was amazing and moved me to laughter and tears, and I'm going to see it again today.  If you're a big Shrek fan, you might not like Ice Age.  But if you like an adult movie with a great, emotional story and rich characterization, I highly recommend ""Ice Age."" <br/><br/>My score: 9.8"

"IcicleFyre","9","1","3","27 March 2002"," Slapstick, heart, and more laughs than I've had in a while
","Having been disappointed by the overrated Shrek, I was delighted to find the fun and whimsy in Ice Age that's been missing in recent films, particularly animated ones. Yes, there are moments, particularly at the beginning, that feel somewhat cliche, but how many ways are there to kick off a journey picture? The characters are strong, the voice acting is excellent, and the plot far more emotion-driven than one would expect from the previews. That being said, the reason I love this picture is the slapstick. It features, in the form of a bizarrely shaped buck-toothed squirrel and his eternal crusade to bury a nut, one of the most original and hysterically funny opening sequences and running gags I've ever seen. Watching Ice Age is like watching an hour and a half of Shrek's Gingerbread Man. I have not laughed this hard in a movie theatre in an extremely long time, and I'd recommend Ice Age to anyone of any age. Nothing too scary for little kids or too intense for the older crowd and enough wit and heart for everyone in between."

","Computer animation is merely a tool. Like all tools the tool actually creates nothing without human intervention and while they may be key to getting something done (this sort of  3D technique is relatively new) they are not a force by themselves. Only a new genre. Here a (talking) comic sloth, a stern mammoth and a slick mountain tiger work together to return a lost baby to its tribe. Well sort-of, but don't let me spoil one of the few lines of plot development for you!<br/><br/>Boy is this thin and well trodden stuff. When two people can't stand each other in films you can be sure that ten minutes down-the-line they will be the best of pals, ready to die for one another. Shame real life isn't like that! <br/><br/>Cliches are not cliches for nothing and the script writers haven't left anything obvious out - bar maybe a musical number, which would have at least been some light relief.<br/><br/>I am reminded of a well known gag that Woody Allen once quoted in a movie about two old women in a restaurant. One says ""isn't the food here terrible."" And the other says ""yes, and such small portions."" This is far from terrible - indeed it is not at all bad - but the portions are too small: Character introduction - journey - climax. <br/><br/>There should have been far more, but in this type of animation every second counts and every extra second shaves a point off the box office income!<br/><br/>Glad I didn't pay for it though and anyone seeing it at a cinema better get a small popcorn or they will be still  eating it on the way home."

I won't go any further.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes animated movies and can overlook some childish flaws.  The humor is satisfying in most (but not all) areas, the characters are deep, the plot isn't bad, and the storyline follows a solid stream of events that will entice you to continue watching.<br/><br/>Also, the music isn't bad in some places.

Sid the sloth is left behind by his family on the way to escaping the coming ice age. He meets up with Manny, a crusty wooly mammoth voiced by Ray Romano, who does a fantastic job. They come upon a mother and her infant and while the mother dies in the icy water they rescue the baby and set off to return him to his own ""herd."" Along the way they pick up Diego, a sabre tooth tiger who is leading them into an ambush by his pack. As time goes on, though, Diego warms up to them all and they end up saving each others life several times over. In the end they all fall in love with the kid, return him to his tribe, and leave as friends. To be an animated film, this has a very moving and emotional storyline and an excellent climax.

The ice age has arrived and animals are heading south but not Manfred the mammoth. He is accompanied by a sloth named Sid and they are forced to trust a saber-tooth tiger named Diago. Ray Romano voices Manfred who faces tradition yet must care for an Eskimo child. This all climaxes upon an unrealistic compromise. John Leguizamo voices the irritating Sid whose job is to provide comic relief and be a complete pain in the frozen asshole to everyone else on this journey. Denis Leary voices Diago who has a predicted change of heart as if nobody could see that coming. And as if anyone needs to point out that it is a saber-tooth cat's nature to be carnivores and not buddy up to humongous mammoths and cuddly sloths. Besides Manfred, the only character of interest is the prehistoric squirrel that is featured periodically in his hazardous quest to obtain an acorn. Director Chris Wedge is backed by decent humour, which works best, but not so much of a script.

As a story, it's more than a bit sloppy, and the humor is hit-and-miss, but it does get better as it goes and makes for painless companion viewing with the little 'uns.<br/><br/>Long before the dawn of modern man, we join a migration of prehistoric mammals â€“ heading north instead of south. For Manfred (Ray Romano), a mammoth, and Sid (John Leguizamo), a giant sloth, it's less a marriage of convenience than the fact they have no one else. They meet an abandoned Neanderthal baby and a saber-toothed tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) with an unhealthy interest in taking the kid for himself. The three work out a deal to deliver the kid to its missing father. Diego's true motives are just the start of their trouble.<br/><br/>Basically an animated, kid-friendly version of the John Wayne cowboy flick ""3 Godfathers,"" ""Ice Age"" presents a harsh winterscape of high imagination. An early example of a fully computer-animated movie produced not by Pixar or Dreamworks but the smaller Blue Sky Studios, ""Ice Age"" is remarkable for its tactile depiction of snow and water as well as the strange beasts long extinct that make up its cast.<br/><br/>It's not all that funny or engaging on its own. The banter is merry but tends to be unmemorable.<br/><br/>""How do we know it's the Ice Age,"" we hear one critter ask.<br/><br/>""Because of all the ice!"" answers another.<br/><br/>The best things about the movie, beyond the sheer spectacle of it, are the voice work of the main actors and David Newman's infectious musical score. Co-directors Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha seem more amused by the plight of ""Ice Age's"" luckless critters than they have a right to be, particularly a poor sabre-tooth squirrel named Scrat whose attempts at securing an acorn unleash a lot of Chuck- Jones-style mayhem without the twisted joy of those classic cartoons of yore. Any time the action shifts to Scrat, I wince a little, but the kids will like it if they are anything like the twisted brats I know.<br/><br/>The film does get better as the relationships between the characters develop. The Diego story arc, as predictable and hokey as it is, pays off rather well. To enjoy ""Ice Age,"" you have to believe in the threat behind the story, and Diego provides much of that. Leary is very good at working the menace into the jokes, and vice versa, though Leguizamo is easily the funniest of the trio, while Romano makes for a solidly enjoyable center.<br/><br/>Some things are not well explained, like the reason Manfred is so determined to journey north in the first place and why he puts up with the annoying Sid for so long. The film moves a bit too slow, even after it brings together our core foursome but especially before that. An emphasis on sentimentality, like multiple close-ups of the spritely Neanderthal baby and Manfred's backstory as revealed in some cave drawings, give ""Ice Age"" a weightiness it doesn't really earn. You just know the directors want to get the theater sniffling, as they admit in their DVD commentary.<br/><br/>The best scenes do have the power to bring out the kid in anyone. If Blue Sky ever opens their own Magic Kingdom, I hope they offer an ice-tunnel ride or Sid Slalom of the kind we get to enjoy here. The film plays too much to its core demographic that way, but I found it preferable at times to the more adult sensibility of snarky Shrek or the Pixar factory."
"hayashimegumi","5","0","3","8 June 2014"," Totally did not expect Ice Age films started like this
","This film will reveal to us how Manny, Sid and Diego meet each other but it is also precisely a story about three prehistoric animals and a baby. I find the whole thing very draggy and the only thing I liked about this film is Scrat, the saber-toothed squirrel with acorn fetish (minor appearances) so watching this film certainly gave me a huge shock.<br/><br/>Fortunately, all the shortcomings have been compensated in the newer Ice Age films. Perhaps the production emphasized too much on visuals so it lacked big time in terms of storyline and characters. Can't wait for Ice Age 5!!"
"willcundallreview","7","0","1","2 April 2014"," A fun animation adventure
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Ice Age is an animation which people still enjoy today, with some quick jokes and fun characters to be around the story truly lifts off and the plot is a fun one too any many cases. With a lovely voice cast to guide us through and it's running time being perfect, we can now truly say that Ice Age is not just a film aimed at 3 year olds. My personal feeling with this was that it is a strongly good movie and worth a watch, and so well here below is why I think it is a movie you should watch.<br/><br/>The story is nicely paced and as said the running time doesn't drag it, it actually makes it better. The plot is fun and not icy at all with some fun jokes but with a sweet centre that can at times pull at the heart strings(well enough to say this is animation and extinct animals). I did love the characters to and I will get onto them in a little bit but they contribute massively to the story and make it flow even nicer. Maybe not superbly funny, the film I feel is meant to be just a big old adventure and if you enjoy that, then give it a go and see where it takes you.<br/><br/>Now on to the characters, I particularly liked all three together as Ray Romano(Manny), John Leguizamo(Sid) and Denis Leary(Diego) work well and really make this film even more fun. Everyone talks about Scrat the little saber toothed squirrel who does make this film even more higher up in the world of animation with a performance that will be remembered for years, and everyone will remember he just couldn't get that acorn out. Finally on Cast I felt the voices were good and varied and I liked the way that the Saber toothed tigers sounded the same as each other, and things like the Dodo's also sounded similar.<br/><br/>Animation isn't the top thing about this and I didn't feel it moved flowingly to be fair, although a fair point is that it was made in 2002 so I guess not to much can be expected of it in that department if made then. I loved the effect used though and some lovely looking things like snow falling and even fire are done well, but on the technical side of the film there isn't too much to talk about so best move on.<br/><br/>It isn't that funny and maybe a point why this isn't a great film, the humour is there but sometimes it feels as if it is aimed too much at kids and that the adults taking there children there, just won't be in the cinema with them. I also said about the animation being a bit poor and well at times it can be very plain the movie scenery wise but in all fairness the animation was never a point I dragged this down on.<br/><br/>I could just tell you that kids will enjoy this, but I also feel adults can too and if your up for an animated adventure then this is for you, especially also that isn't too long a film either. Those who want a really funny film don't watch and people who dislike more slapstick ""type"" humour also don't watch, but I would also like to say that I would recommend this film to anyone, even if you don't always watch things like this.<br/><br/>Overall a 7/10 from me as I felt it was Strongly a Good film, quite near to being very good but what I put in criticisms just didn't allow it. Either watching this with children, or watching by your yourself Ice Age has a little something for everyone, you won't be crying with laughter but I do think this film will leave a little warm feeling in you, and you may want to see more of it, of which there is plenty."
"aswath3006","7","0","1","22 October 2013"," Good, Warming Experience
","This movie is Blue Sky's first all CGI film. Definiatly, it was a very good first. The story, though simple and very much predictable (The ending), was a good twist of a classic story, that of finding a lost child, and getting him/her, back home.<br/><br/>The movie engages the traits, values and qualities of friendship, trust, betrayal and togetherness. The scene in which we find out that Diego is actually behind killing the mammoth, is shocking and also a little absurd and 'hole-y' as Diego was seen alone in the beginning of the movie but not as a pack.<br/><br/>Later when Diego betrays his pack (it was the right thing, but I'm still gonna go with betray), the scene was very much predictable to older audiences (such as myself), but does teach younger audiences about betrayal, friendship and doing the right things.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie. Comedy was good, but average. Scratt was the best, followed by Sid.<br/><br/>MY RATING = 7/10."

","Ice Age<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>81 mins/ U<br/><br/>Cast: (voice) Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, Cedric the Entertainer, Stephen Root, Diedrich Bader, Alan Tudyk, Chris Wedge<br/><br/>Directors: Carlos Saldanha, Chris Wedge<br/><br/>Plot: A sabre-tooth tiger, a sloth and a mammoth come together to return a human child to its tribe in the Ice Age.<br/><br/>JJ's Verdict: Ice Age is a talky, fun but poor looking animation set in the times of the deep freeze. Although it includes many other animals, the film centres mainly on a charming but vicious sabre-tooth tiger, a lively but irritating sloth and a miserable and cynical mammoth who are forced to join each other in a quest to return a lost human infant back to its tribe.<br/><br/>Ice Age is full of brilliant voice work from Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary who all clearly define their animal's characteristics and have excellent chemistry with one and other. This was a must in a film with poor and unrealistic CGI animation that not only gives little effect to the backdrops and landscapes but also gives the characters few facial expressions and emotions.<br/><br/>Apart from the main trio, there is also an excellent independent character in Scrat, an acorn- chasing squirrel. Scrat is entirely there to be laughed at and as lightning, an avalanche, and glacier and ice cracking prevent Scrat from his acorns, you can only sit there in hysterics. Although the verbal humour is funny, the physical, slapstick humour can get tiring to watch and most of the 'action' sequences turn out to be somewhat anti-climaxes. <br/><br/>Ice Age is an emotionally advanced kids film with very strong themes of friendship and divided loyalty but it's just a shame that it has to come through the voice-actors â€“ not the animation."
"roedyg","3","0","1","1 July 2010"," Lame
","This is the worst feature length cartoon I have ever seen. I usually enjoy the genre as much as any kid. The problem is the lack of originality. Ice Age feels like those old Matlock episodes they would create by cutting together from previous ones. It is like they cranked previous cartoons through some AI morpher to create pseudo-new content.<br/><br/>Manfred the Mammoth has a leading role. He has not a funny bone in his body. He is depressed, rude, a bully and self-centred, hardly a likable hero. He would be a fine side character, but he wastes huge amounts of screen time. He is BORING! For the genre to work, it really needs danceable, singable music.<br/><br/>John Leguizamo, as Sid, was up to Lion King quality, but that was not enough to carry the show."

","I saw Ice Age for the first time this past year. (2006) I love the movie, more then any other movie I watch this whole year. This would defiantly be my favorite movie. My friends and I watch this movie every few weeks. It always makes us laugh. Ice Age has many characters that well keep you laughing during the whole movie. It is a movie that any age group can watch it, and love it. <br/><br/>There are many characters in the movie that will keep you entertain. Sid (a sloth), Manny (a mammoth), Diego (a saber tooth tiger), three different animals coming together to back their own heard. But they never knew that they would run into a lost human infant, and go into an adventure to try to return him to his father and his tribe.<br/><br/>It's a movie that will honestly keep you laughing. From the sloth just saying random things, to the squirrel chasing the nut all around the place. Causing damage to the Ice Age. It's a great movie, full of laughs and it also has a great theme."
"abrafocus","6","0","2","9 March 2006"," Good story, poor animation.
","I hated the fact that the animators made it so the humans looked like they were halfway from evolving from apes. They didn't talk at all through the whole movie. What's up with that? On the other hand, the story is fairly good. I like the humor of Manfred, the giant mammoth, (voiced by Ray Ramano) and Sid, the dumb sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo). Diego was a good character too, voiced by Denis Leary. (who also voices Francis the male ladybug in ""A Bug's Life."") The finding and returning the human ""baby"" though, is a little typical. Why must it always be a ""find and rescue"" type of thing?"" Though, ""Finding Nemo"" is an example of a great ""search and rescue"" -type movie.<br/><br/>The humans were poorly animated, and as I said before, look like half-apes and half-human. We all should know by now that evolution is still an unproven theory. It's 100% theory, nothing more.<br/><br/>""Ice Age"" is not among my Top 30, nor will it ever will be. But it still is an average movie, so if you have nothing better to do, watch it. Otherwise, pick something else.<br/><br/>My Score: 6/10."

","I watched this film with a bit of trepidation, since I don't normally care for films of this genre. However, I found myself mildly surprised at the quality of this one. While the animation isn't terribly great, the story pulls the film along nicely. It's paced properly, with no wasted time. There is little need for violence, so there's very little of it. Drama and humor are the major elements in the film. Much of the humor is provided almost as a sidebar by a prehistoric saber-toothed squirrel named Scrat. He has the worst time keeping up with an acorn that he's trying to store away. The dramatic element is provided by an unlikely trio trying to return a lost human infant to it's ""herd"". The trio, a woolly mammoth, a sloth and a saber-toothed tiger, face several trials and some outside interference to try to accomplish their task. This was a pretty enjoyable flick and I'd recommend it to everybody, especially children."
"rebeljenn","7","0","2","30 December 2005"," Fun, fresh, engaging - and the best trailer I've seen
","'Ice Age' is a fresh and original animation taking place among animal misfits in the ice age. The unlikely animals band together to form a friendship based on returning a human baby to its parents and avoiding the evil sabre-toothed tigers from stealing the baby. Hilarious events take place on their journey, and it is a deeply engaging and fresh film. Children and adults both can enjoy this film.<br/><br/>I remember catching the trailer for this film in 2000 - several times. The trailer itself was a work of art. As soon as the little squirrel came on the screen with his acorn, the audience was immediately hushed and wrapped up in the unfolding action. I have never seen an audience react so intensely on a film trailer. I think that they did a very good job putting the trailer together, and it is - by far - the most effective trailer I have ever seen. Watching the audience's response to this trailer time and time again was wonderful.<br/><br/>I was amazed at how good the animation was. It's not totally realistic animation, but they did a good job at keeping it simple and not letting it distract from the action. The 'feel' of the film reminded me of 'The Lion King', but this story was much better; I was also not annoyed with the sloth character, but I was annoyed with Timon and Pumba from 'The Lion King'. I thought that all of the characters, including the secondary ones, were quite charming in their own individual aspects. It's a touching little animation, and I recommend this to both adults and children."
"reindeer2uk","10","0","2","7 December 2005"," ""Ice Age"",a marvellous film for everyone
","Although aimed at children, ""Ice Age"" is a little like one of those timeless tribal stories where different age groups get something valuable out of the tale at different levels, whilst always enjoying the story into the bargain.<br/><br/>Its simple plot and easy going pace, do nothing but enhance its delivery and charm. Timeless you might say.<br/><br/>The film follows three widely different species of mammal as they seek to return a Human child to his people.They are Manfred the mammoth, Sid the sloth, and Diego the sabre-toothed tiger. They go through several testing adventures together, an experience which is often fertile soil for the making of strong friendships. Here is no exception since they come to refer to themselves as ""the herd"".<br/><br/>I think the choice of mammoth as one of the child's saviours is a wise one since there have been allegorical tales of their surviving relatives, the elephants extending a level of concern beyond their own species.<br/><br/>There is one very touching scene which takes place within a cave which Humans have perhaps used for generations to reflect and meditate on their place in the world. It is daubed with paintings of various animals, among which are mammoths being hunted. We are witness though to what appears to be a bond and an understanding between the child and Manfred, that their friendship transcends such concerns.<br/><br/>Sid looks like a caricature rather than a real sloth, and most of Diego's feline pride also look caricatured. That said, I simply love the animation of the characters, and the level of observation which has obviously gone into living cats, pachyderms and Humans. Diego does the cat-crawl, and Manfred uses his trunk with absolute sensitivity, as would his latter day relatives.<br/><br/>If you have young children show them this film, they'll love it. If you don't have children don't worry. See it anyway, and remember that friendship and responsibility frequently extends to those of another species."

","Forget Shrek.. Forget Toy Story.. This is the best animated film EVER. It has everything. Comedy, Drama, and it has a really good storyline, with another ongoing storyline. That of Scrat's Acorn Hunt. Ice Age has to be my favourite film ever, as i never get bored of it! The voices a great, as well as the characters themselves. Sid's voice in my opinion being the best as well as him being my favourite character in the film.. All three main characters have background issues going on which we are told more about as the film unfolds. The detail on the animation is very good as well.. You can tell when they're wet. You can see every different hair on Manfred's body, and you can see it swaying in the wind. I have just found out that they're making a sequel. Let's hope it is as good if not better than the first one.. Undoubtedly it will be a great animated film. Let's hope we see Sid, Manfred, Diago and Scrat in the sequel as well as some new faces!"

","This movie was flat out hilarious and Sid the Sloth will make you laugh yourself silly. Sid is a cross between Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin, and Travis Rice. Scrat is the most hilarious squirrel to ever walk the face of the earth and undoubtedly the most unlucky one. Manfred is a normal lonely mammoth played by Ray Romano so he has to be funny. And Diego is a good saber tooth tiger who starts off as the bad guy but ends up saving everyones life and is also kind funny.And a warm hearted human baby. So you can imagine this being funny but you would be wrong, this is hilarious. And a useful tip, if you ever rent this movie or buy it be sure to watch Scrats missing adventure because it is the funniest short film you will ever see plenty of fun for the whole family for all ages.10/10 stars"

All the lead characters were hilarious, the lines wouldn't have been presented as well without the great comedians that did their voices. John Leguizamo and Denis Leary were superb!  Ray Romano was really good too, but the best lines and voices were - from Leguizamo and Leary.<br/><br/>Ice Age is a sweet story for kids and a few double ant Andres for the adults.  Although, I'm not sure why they insist on throwing those in there. <br/><br/>
But overall it was a really enjoyable little Pixar movie (much better than Monsters, Inc.) and the CG was really something else. I give the movie (10 being the highest) a 7.

","ICE AGE is a compelling animation which uses simple imagery, dark humour and quirky characters to pull a masterpiece together.  <br/><br/>This is a movie for all ages:the belief that lesser beings should be helped or protected,that those in danger should be looked out for(cos that's what we do in a herd)that silly situations should be laughed off(dinner on a shelf), that you can redeem yourself by not lowering your standards (I don't eat junk food). <br/><br/>The thrill of it all is that every situation is humourous(if darkly so), the morality stands out all through; never be surety for a stranger as you'll pay for it.  Which is what Manny & Sid found out with Diego though he developed a change of heart after Manny risked his life to save him. <br/><br/>
My nieces and nephew loved this picture and laughed all through it as did four other adults who accompanied them to see it(We laughed even louder and harder than they did).<br/><br/>ICE AGE will definitely leave you with internal global warming(hint). <br/><br/>

","Following as it did so successfully on the heels of Pixar's Monster's Inc. and Dreamworks' Shrek, Ice Age may have been the film that cemented the new age of computer generated animation on the big screen.  The fact that the film was so successful at its release date (March 15,2002), not a particularly lucrative period in the film release season suggests that the computer was beginning to erode the interest that audiences held in traditional cell animation.  Of course strong story, interesting characters, a Chuck Jone's inspired stylization and a inventive take on the Ice Age helped make this film a hit.  But the images and visual language, especially in the lighting of the settings had a big impact, making Blue Sky Studios a fresh new competitor on the animated film scene.  It will be interesting to see how Chris Wedge and his cohorts use this success in future developments and how this will play in the competitive world of computer and cell animation."

That and good artistic direction gives this film a very ""pure"" look to it.  By comparison, the animation in Monsters Inc. looks too way busy with its emphasis on physics, shadows, and hair.

As a result, I missed ""Ice Age"" on its theatrical release, but thankfully I bit the bullet and bought it on DVD and I can now say that Fox have come back with a vengeance: ""Ice Age"" is a scream!<br/><br/>Where ""Monsters, Inc"" was uncharacteristically flat and irritating (especially the character 'Mike', voiced by Billy Crystal), ""Ice Age"" hits you with a knockout opening (featuring a character not unlike Wile E Coyote (Skrat) who never quite manages to bury his acorn) and goes on from there until the closing credits.<br/><br/>The main protagonists of the movie: Manfred the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano who sounds not unlike John Ratzenberger, who voiced 'Hamm' from ""Toy Story"" and 'P T Flea' from ""A Bug's Life""); Sid the Sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo, the actor who played 'Clown' in ""Spawn"") and Diego the Sabre-Toothed Tiger (voiced by Denis Leary who did Francis the Ladybug in ""A Bug's Life""), all have amazing characteristics and interact perfectly. The action sequences are spectacular (the opening and the ice slide sequences especially) and the moments of pathos are executed well. Even the cutesy child is not as remotely annoying as the cutesy child in ""Monsters, Inc"".<br/><br/>On the DVD, you even get Skrat appearing in a four plus minute adventure ""Gone Nutty"", which is an homage to Tex Avery. Awesome!<br/><br/>10/10!"

","I just saw this on a flight back from Hawaii, and, as a way to kill time on a crowded airplane, this fit the bill nicely. It is typical animated light entertainment, in which an unlikely group of animals team up (for a variety of different reasons) after they find a baby human. This plot gimmick is, for grown-ups anyway, rather contrived, but who cares? This is, first and foremost, a kid's movie, and it borrows heavily from the classic Disney animated films in that it features a veritable menagerie of interesting and offbeat animal characters whose interactions manage to transcend an otherwise implausible story. This is by no means a great film, nor even a great animated film, nevertheless it is entirely satisfying way to spend an hour and a half, especially when you're stuffed into the back of a DC-10 late at night out in the middle of the Pacific. <br/><br/>6/10"

","In Ice Age, a wooly mammoth named Manny (voiced by Ray Romano); a dull-witted, chatty sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo), and a fierce saber-tooth tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) join to bring a lost human infant back to his father. What peril over yon hill awaits these merry travelers?<br/><br/>Manny is the linchpin of the trio. He's a lone mammoth, staying put when all others of his kind (as well as of any other kind) begin their yearly migration to a more arid climate. Manny is morose and a little bitter, but this is quickly recognized as a facade for a warmhearted mammal. He initially wants to stay a lone mammoth, but he's soon joined by the ever-jabbering Sid, who's a little short on both brain and brawn power. When a baby human is left behind by his dying mother, Sid convinces the immovable Manny to help transport the tyke back to his family.<br/><br/>The two are joined by Diego, a saber-tooth tiger who was in on the attack on the family and tribe of the young human. Diego's been ordered to retrieve the baby by the head tiger, who wants to do all sorts of nasty and unspeakable things to the infant. Diego's plan is to ingratiate himself with Sid and Manny, offering to take them to the area where they can meet up with the human tribe. Which is fine with Manny, who just wants to be rid of the kid - and Sid.<br/><br/>Ice Age, then, is a good old-fashioned buddy pic. The three disparate animals, each outcast in very subtle ways, form a bond that has a common goal. Along the way, they face dangers more of the nature type than of the predator type, and each saves and is saved. But this isn't a movie about great moral lessons; it's a damn hilarious laugh-a-minute cartoon. It's aimed at kids, of course, although the style of animation (it looks a little closer to Toy Story than, say, Looney Toons) can be appreciated by adults, too. <br/><br/>But what makes this such a cool movie is that the writing and the timing of the humor - and it's heavy into physical comedy - are impeccable. Sure, it's easier to do this with animation than with live action, but any movie at which I can laugh out loud, unprompted, at a near-constant rate is a surefire winner. Of course, at this point most kids have seen this - pardon me for being one of the last - but if you can still spot it in the theater, please do go."
"pmcollectorboy","6","0","1","26 March 2002"," Funny but brutally straightforward
","Much like Monsters, Inc., I had a really good time watching this movie but felt that something had gone wrong somewhere.<br/><br/>First let's start with the good. The jokes are funny and clever and never let up. They're a good combination of the typical verbal humor and the not so typical sight gags. This movie also has one of the longest running gags I've ever seen in an animated movie. The characters are colorful and really know how to tickle your funny bone.<br/><br/>Now the bad. The characters fall prey to unconvincing conventions later on in the movie. The story doesn't have the minor plot nitpicks that Monsters, Inc. had, but it's also much more brutally straightforward. Unlike Monsters, Inc., there's really not much point to Ice Age's story. It's there and back again, and you're left wondering ""Um. Yeah.""<br/><br/>Even still, Ice Age is a fun knee-slapper that has enough charm and humor to elevate it above Dinosaur. But it lacks the gentle charm combined with zaniness found in The Emperor's New Groove or the craftiness of Chicken Run or Shrek. Even The Land Before Time was a better ""buddies on a journey"" movie than this one. But at any rate, I give this a 7."

","ICE AGE (2002) ***1/2 (VOICES: Ray Romano, John Leguizamo, Denis Leary, Goran Visnjic, Jack Black, Tara Strong, Cedric the Entertainer, Stephen Root, Deidrich Bader, Jane Krakowski, Josh Hamilton)  Fun and frenetic animated farce set during the prehistoric era with an unlikely trio of mammals on the verge of extinction Â– a woolly mammoth (dead-panned Romano); a hyperactive yet warm-hearted sloth (goofy Leguizamo); and a snarky underhanded saber tooth tiger (subtly edgy Leary) Â– who team up to save a human baby in their trek of evolution.  Free-wheeling and intriguing color schemes gives the genre a unique look and a dandy screenplay by Michael Berg, Michael J. Wilson and Peter Ackerman with lots of verbal interplay between the trio is a delight while surprisingly touching.  Best bit is the scrat (cross between squirrel & rat) as a running gag.

","This is a wonderful film, full of laughs and a terrific message for kids. The animation is first rate and the actors involved are delightful. Following the ""herd"" has never been so much fun.  The movie is perfect for any age.  It was enlightening to discover what really happened to the dodo bird and to sit back and just enjoy a fun family film.  Adults will not be disappointed with this film.  Parents, if it is your turn to take the youngsters to the movies, you will be pleased with this one."
