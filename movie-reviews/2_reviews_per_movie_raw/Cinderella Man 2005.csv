"MR_Heraclius","10","37","39","21 February 2020"," Best boxing movie made.
","Truly inspiring story of James J. Braddock. This story is about more than boxing. It is about a man and his wife trying to raise a family in the tough times of the 1920s. And the integrity and example he shows his children in those times. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are just part of this incredible cast. It is a must see."
"MartinHafer","8","13","13","22 August 2012"," A very good film that apparently takes HUGE liberties with some facts to make for a more exciting film.
","Before I get to whether or not I liked this film, the history teacher in me thinks it's very important to set the record straight. Although the film is pretty accurate when it comes to the career of James Braddock, it's very inaccurate in portraying his opponent, Max Baer. The champion, Baer, is shown as a sadistic jerk who killed two men while boxing--and really delighted in taunting Braddock about this. In the film, the evil and filthy-mouthed Baer tells Braddock to bow out of the fight, as he could be the next to die in the ring--and he really seems to LIKE tormenting Braddock's wife about this. In reality, Baer killed one man in the ring. It was a horrible accident which occasionally happens in boxing--one which apparently haunted Baer for the rest of his life. In fact, he helped pay for his dead opponents to get educations and looked after this family--hardly the act of a sadist. I understand why the folks who made ""Cinderella Man"" changed this in an attempt to create tension, but the story would have STILL worked great if it had just stuck to the truth. Plus, think of how this film affected Baer's relatives when they saw it. Max Baer Jr. ('Jethro' from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"") knew his father was not like this and I am sure it pained him to see him so badly misrepresented.<br/><br/>As for the NON-Baer parts of the film, they are great. The look of the 1930s is exceptional--much more realistic than you often see in films. Also, the acting is terrific, the film VERY engaging and the story of Braddock very compelling. Without the misrepresentation of Baer's in the story, I would have given this one a 10. Really....it's that compelling and they did a great job. The acting, direction, designs...everything but the writing was perfect.<br/><br/>By the way, this isn't so much a complaint as an observation. In this movie, like practically EVERY other boxing movie, there is hardly any defense (such as blocked shots) in the boxing matches--punch after punch that lands on the opponent. If fights REALLY were like this, they'd rarely go beyond the first round!"
"bitcetc","9","319","419","23 May 2005"," Russell Crowe K.O.
","The dilemma: I hate boxing movies; I love Russell Crowe movies. I've already seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Raging Bull"" this year, and accidentally watched part of one of the ""son of Rocky"" serial movies on a Saturday afternoon. I feel like I am being punched, as Renee' Zellwegger's character Mae Braddock says, and I'm not as tough as these prize fighters.<br/><br/>But this one has Russell Crowe in it. And that makes all the difference. <br/><br/>It is not that Renee Zellwegger and Paul Giamatti, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and Craig Bierko, among others, give less than stellar performances: they all live up to their justifiably great reputations. You have to believe they are at the top of their game. But for all of Russell Crowe's reputation for being ""difficult"", it is hard to think of actors who can equal his personal force on the screen. He is brilliant. <br/><br/>Ron Howard has made of the real life of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock a work of art. The camera work is phenomenal. Without using violins or cliché' pull-back shots showing the numbers of people homeless and in soup lines, Howard makes the Depression a visceral reality with scenes of near-hopeless men at the docks, pleading for a day's work; a stolen salami; Crowe's giving his daughter his breakfast piece of bologna, telling her he dreamed he was full. The bleakness of the times is the graininess and the sepia/greyness of the camera shots; the images are stark but completely descriptive. Crowe as Braddock with hat in hand and tears in his eyes, begging for twenty dollars so he can get his children back into his home, is the personification of pride sacrificed to desperation. But when Braddock is later asked at a press conference why he is fighting at his age and after so many poor showings, all he has to say is ""milk"" to be supremely eloquent.<br/><br/>Doubtless many people know the history of James Braddock, and know the outcome of his fights, including the championship bout with Max Baer, who had already killed two men in the ring. If you don't know, DON'T look it up before you see the movie, and if you DO KNOW, DON'T TELL, but go. Analogous to watching Howard's film ""Apollo 13"", you may know the outcome, but there's wonderful suspense in the details. These were among the most exciting last twenty minutes I've seen on film. I didn't expect to be able to watch, but like Braddock's terrified wife Mae, I was unable to tear myself away.<br/><br/>The audience was like a prize fight audience, cheering, booing, gasping, groaning during the fights. We applauded Braddock's wins, suffered his defeats. It is a great movie, with authentic heart. Solid A."
"mstomaso","10","228","297","4 June 2005"," Very little to say...
","My heart was firmly lodged in my throat for the last hour and a half of The Cinderella Man. Nobody does true-story heroism like Ron Howard, and few can do heroes like Russell Crowe. Though Howard fictionalizes his subjects, and does not pretend to make documentaries, he does accurately depict the feeling and the major points of his subjects. <br/><br/>Jim Braddock was a depression-era boxer who everybody thought was down for the count. Though there is a lot of boxing in this film, this is not a boxing movie, but rather his story and the story of the family that inspired him to fight back against prejudice and hopelessness, to rise to heights that would inspire a nation. Braddock is portrayed in a moving and powerful manner, with remarkable performances all around, one of the best scripts I can remember in recent years, and occasionally brutal action.<br/><br/>Those who have run into my reviews may note that this is one of my shortest. Please understand that I really don't think there's much to say about this simple, beautiful and very human story, besides - see it!"
"lavatch","Null","127","162","3 June 2005"," James J. Braddock: Gladiator of the Great Depression
","""Cinderella Man"" deserves to be placed alongside other great biographical films dealing with the lives and times of great boxers. Such films include ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Joe Louis Story,"" ""Ali,"" ""The Hurricane,"" and ""Ring of Fire: The Emile Griffith Story."" <br/><br/>These films share in common not just a documentary-like approach to boxing or a superficial biopic. They also portray the human side of a modern gladiator and the culture that produced him. In the case of ""Cinderella Man,"" we are given a detailed and heart-rending portrait of the Great Depression in American. The story of the gentleman pugilist James J. Braddock is the backdrop to the larger drama of Americans' struggle in the 1930s.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe provides a brilliant interpretation of Braddock, capturing the decency of a man whose career as a boxer would appear to have peaked at just the wrong time prior to the Crash of 1929. After that momentous event, Braddock's boxing went into decline just like the lives of millions of Americans. The scenes of Braddock and his family living in squalid conditions and with uncertainty about such basics as heat and electricity were carefully developed in the film. Renée Zellweger was outstanding as Mae, the caring but feisty wife of Braddock. Paul Giamatti was also excellent as Braddock's handler-manager, Joe Gould. Joe tries to keep up appearances by sporting fancy clothes. But in one revealing scene in the film when we see the interior of Joe's ostensibly swanky apartment, there is no fancy furniture other than a dowdy table and some flimsy deck chairs. Everyone is reeling from the Depression. In the depiction of the massive unemployment, the ""Hoovervilles"" of the homeless residing in Central Park, and the desperate need for Americans for an optimistic icon like Braddock to raise their spirits, the film truly captured the tragedy of the Great American Depression.<br/><br/>The film's director Ron Howard emphasized close-ups throughout the film with uneven results. In many of the boxing sequences, the close-ups and rapid editing made it difficult tell the fighters apart. The close-ups continued even into the domestic scenes and the outdoor sequences depicting Braddock working as a longshoreman. The film's dark cinematography conveyed the bleakness of the Depression years, but it worked against bringing out the buoyant spirit of Braddock himself and the optimism that he instilled in others. As a director, Howard's strength is not in film artistry or technique. As apparent in this and other films, his gift lies in narrative storytelling and the development of dramatic character.<br/><br/>Indeed, the characters and the story were the strong points of ""Cinderella Man."" Much credit should go to Cliff Hollingsworth for a screenplay that included thoughtful dialogue, humor, and multi-dimensional characters. Daniel Orlandi also merits praise for the brilliant costumes that helped to recreate the period of the early 1930s.<br/><br/>But the heart of this film experience is Russell Crowe's screen portrayal of Braddock. It was the colorful sportswriter and raconteur Damon Runyan who coined the nickname of ""Cinderella Man"" for Braddock. However, the real James J. Braddock was more than lucky. It was his strength of character in and out of the ring that captivated America. One of the most moving scenes of the film was a heated argument between Braddock and his wife Mae where Braddock insists that even in the most difficult of times, he would refuse to be separated from his children. As a boxer, he was fearless. But he demonstrated even more courage in fighting for family valuesa lesson from which we can learn a great deal today in reflecting on this sensitive film."
"cquinn-1","10","254","333","25 May 2005"," Old story well told!
","Geez, another boxing movie! Yeah, Yeah, I know the story. Down and out guy gets a break and makes the most of it. He's fighting for his family, he's fighting for all those other hopeless people. Been there, done that.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot to mention one thing. This movie is about the best 140 minute I've spent in a movie theater since . . . . since . . . ., Oh, well, you get the picture. Better yet, instead of getting the picture, go see it.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe owns the character of James Braddock, the unlikely hero who makes the most of his second chance. He's a good fighter turned hack. Injury, bad luck and this thing called the Depression sends him down the drain.<br/><br/>His wife, Mae, played by Renee Zelleweger, wants to be his biggest fan, but the kids need a dad, the rent has to get paid and the money from boxing dried up along time ago. Her husband's courage is undoubted, but his nerve is killing her.<br/><br/>And then there's Joe Gould, played by Paul Giamatti.<br/><br/>A boxer by the name of George Cochan once told me his manager was the bravest man he ever knew, he was willing to pit his man (Cochan) against anyone. As a result, Cochan had his head handed to him multiple times by the likes of Jake LaMotta and other class middle weights of the Forties and Fifties. Gould, is that brave manager, if not literally, in spirit. He pits Braddock, out of shape and with one day notice, against the number two heavy weight contender. Regardless of the risk, it's a pay day needed by both Gould and Braddock.<br/><br/>The story, while familiar, is executed brilliantly. The camera work is both subtle and, in turn, spectacular. Craig Bierko, Paddy Considine, Bruce McGill and the rest of the cast give flawless performances.<br/><br/>Yes, been there, done that! And I'm ready to do it again for anyone who wants to go with me."

"Hmshollyt","10","207","281","25 May 2005"," Wonderful!
","This is a truly great film. Russel Crowe, Rene Zellweger and Paul Giametti were all fabulous. Russell Crowe is the best actor of our time. I am not a boxing fan, but I was so engrossed by the character of the Cinderalla Man that I was totally involved in every punch. I didn't know how the story would end, so I had the added thrill of suspense during the final fight.<br/><br/>The story of a family in the midst of the Great Depression was as compelling as the boxing story. The solid family man played by Russell gives us a much needed role model. The historical and socio-economic background was powerfully shown and greatly added to the audience's involvement and is particularly relevant to today. This is a classic film."
"maxlebow","10","21","25","2 March 2006"," Living and Surviving During the Great Depression
","If the great depression of the 1930s is a mystery to you, then Cinderella Man can fix that. The story, about the ups and downs in the career of a boxer, is uplifting and entertaining. However, what makes this film more than that is its believable depiction of the great depression.<br/><br/>The sets look similar to pictures I have seen in books I read about the depression, and the costumes are correct. But this is not just a ""period piece."" The behavior of everyone in the cast, and every extra, shows dedication to reproducing the gestures and attitudes I have observed in people I have personally known who lived through the depression.<br/><br/>Take, for example, the scene at the dock where Braddock, the boxer, waits with dozens of other men for the chance to work a stevedore job for the day. ""We need ten,"" shouts the boss. Then he points, and counts. Every eye is trying to meet his, trying to be picked. Not a gesture is out of place.<br/><br/>This kind of verisimilitude comes only from fanatics for accuracy. Look at drector Ron Howard and male lead Russell Crowe. Ron Howard also directed Cocoon, Willow, and -- for the Academy Award for Best Director and the Academy Award for Best Picture -- A Beautiful Mind, which also starred Crowe. He drove the set designers, the costumers, the cast, and the extras, with telling effect. Nothing is over-acted.<br/><br/>Crowe trained for the film using the same, low-tech methods used in boxing in the 1930s. He also studied film footage of Braddock to master the real fighter's characteristic gestures. In the ring, said one of Crowe's trainers, he successfully duplicated Braddock's moves, his footwork, and his style.<br/><br/>The boxing drives the story along. It is bloody, fierce boxing. Some people may find the fight scenes objectionably violent. Crowe broke his hand in training. Real fighters played most of his opponents. Sometimes they forgot they were supposed to fake punches, leading to the spilling of real blood, which was left in the final version. Crowe also landed a few real punches by mistake.<br/><br/>The boxing, however, is overshadowed by life during the depression. Millions were out of work. Milk was delivered in bottles, by a milk man. People left their empty milk bottles out at night so the milk man could collect them early the next morning, and replace them with full bottles. When the dairy could no longer extend a family's credit, the empty bottles were still there in the morning with a note of apology stuck in the mouth of one of them.<br/><br/>During the depression, there was no unemployment insurance, no Medicaid, and no Social Security. There was the dole, but it was new, humiliating, and under funded. You cold not get enough to keep your family fed and clothed.<br/><br/>Braddock is shown waiting for and getting his dole, another moving scene in which everyone is stoically in character. The film also accurately depicts the huge gap that opened between the masses of the poor, and the few, fabulously wealthy.<br/><br/>This is a very entertaining film. However, if you are just beginning to study the great depression, it can be a a great head start."

","I saw this film on May 17th in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival that screens films for their Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""...explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>The impact of this film on the viewer is as powerful as Rocky and Million Dollar Baby. While all three films have boxing and love of the underdog as a common theme, this movie is much more. The backdrop of the movie is Depression-era America around NYC. And you are taken back to this depressing and hopeless time of willing, hard-working, idle, discouraged, poor people.<br/><br/>The threesome of Russell Crowe, as the fighter Braddock, and Renee Zellweger, as his wife, and Paul Giamatti, as his manager were Academy-Award worthy. They professionally played their parts and let the story be the real star.<br/><br/>Braddock is a down-on-his-luck aging and hurt boxer who can no longer box and can no longer find enough work to support his wife and three kids. By a twist of fate, he is given another chance to fight, and his career begins again.<br/><br/>Braddock and his wife display low-key dignity and honor that we wish we all had. They are good spouses, parents, neighbors and citizens without ""showing off."" While this is a serious drama, it has a lot of light humor throughout the picture that is entertaining and appropriate. Director Ron Howard does a wonderful storytelling job and has kept directorial tricks to a minimum.

","This is the best film Ron Howard has ever done. They really caught lightning in a bottle with this one. All the departments brought their A game to the table. I especially loved the editing and cinematography.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect and, under Ron Howard's confident hand, all give amazing performances. Russel Crowe's soulful performance puts him back in Maximus territory here and, boy, was this cat born to play these types of roles. Bruce McGill is in it (San Antonio, represent!!!) and that's always a good thing.<br/><br/>My only complaint (if it can be called that) is that the boxing sequences break no new ground. They are very reminiscent of the boxing sequences in Raging Bull. They are so well executed, however, that I quickly forgot about this small nitpick.<br/><br/>The script works on so many levels, it's not even funny. There is plenty of time devoted to character development and it pays off handsomely in the long run as we really care about Jim Braddock every time he steps in the ring.<br/><br/>All in all, Cinderella Man is a rousing, classy film that utterly satisfies."

","I also went to a sneak preview of this movie last night, and it was good enough for me to join this site and write my first review. It did start out kind of slow, but the complete rainbow of emotions was contained in this movie. There were parts that nearly made you cry. There were parts that made you laugh out loud. I could barely contain my excitement during the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, I just wanted to scream out loud I was so excited. When we left the theater there was a ~60 year old woman delicately shadow boxing on her way out the door. Her husband asked her, ""Are you winning?""

Him and his family experienced all the heartaches that everyone else did at that time.<br/><br/>Even though he retired from boxing (he was viewed as a joke), his manager (Giamatti) got him one fight against a #1 contender to the belt.

"Bmovie","8","89","132","17 May 2005"," Excellent fiction treatment of historical boxer ""Humbling Bull""
","Just saw a preview of this film (opens June 3) and as shamelessly emotional as it is, I liked it very much. It provides a more visceral view of the Great Depression era than did another fine film, Seabiscuit. Call it Seabiscuit with even more heart! <br/><br/>Ron Howard teams with Russell Crowe (James J. Braddock) again and shows they can repeat with a winner. Like him as a person or not, Crowe puts forth another finely tuned, very convincing performance. Unlike in real life, he can be quite humble and sympathetic while beating the heck out of people. Really, his character is affecting, especially in his scenes with Braddock's children, and may be fairly reflective of the actual person of Braddock. (The fight game at that time, or any time, was not for saints but, whatever.) Renee Zellweger, who is not my favorite except for a brilliant portrayal in Cold Mountain, plays the wife effectively and mirrors the emotions for the females in the audience. (If my observations at the showing are typical, women fans will spend time alternately heading their eyes and virtually cheering out loud for Braddock/Crowe.) <br/><br/>There are a number of good supporting actors but Paul Giamatti strikes again! He plays the manager who supports Braddock through thick and thin and his character recalls the era better than anyone in the film. I don't know what kind of research he did for this role but his Joe Gould is the archetypal boxing manager of the time or, at least, our cinema image of one. Here's hoping he pulled some big bucks for a role for once.<br/><br/>(You will certainly recognize Bruce McGill, as the seemingly hard-hearted fight promoter who could care less about Braddock but really doesn't want to see him get killed in the ring, from many movie and TV appearances where he is always reliable and who may be remembered from an early exposure as ""D-Day"" in Animal House.)"
"mentalcritic","8","5","5","5 October 2005"," Flawed, but moving biopic
","Readers of some of my comments might guess that I am not terribly impressed with Ron Howard as a producer or director, and that one of his projects will go down in my memory as an insult. So it should tell you a lot about the quality of Cinderella Man that I found it an enjoyable and moving film. It is not without its faults, granted, but its strengths are great enough that this mostly does not matter. I thought that it could have been better if Howard had not resorted to bowdlerising his subject at the expense of an opponent, but as I said to a fellow viewer the night I saw it, it could have been much worse. Like many films that star Russell Crowe, Cinderella Man literally balances itself upon his shoulders, and it gets very comfortable there for once. Crowe has been carrying films on his individual strength since almost the beginning of his career, so it should come as no surprise that he handles this with expert poise. He may have a reputation for being difficult to work with, but he also produces results that are well worth it.<br/><br/>The Great Depression was a time of many things, mostly variations on misery, and Cinderella Man does not let up for one minute in depicting this. The biggest challenge of a film about boxing is giving the central character a reason to box, and this film nails that from the get-go. In an interview before the climactic fight, we hear Braddock tell the press that he is doing the fight because he wants to be able to buy milk. There are few people in today's English-speaking world who know anything resembling such desperation. Most of them only know it because of how they were born a little different to those in power. Anyway, the second challenge of a boxing film is to make the audience feel as if they are part of the match. Howard apparently accomplished this partly by placing a camera in a protective case and having his actors punch that. In other places, he uses the viewpoint of the character, or just films the action from the appropriate angle. Granted, some of the camera-work was a bit on the nose, so to speak, but it was mostly effective. If nothing else, Ron Howard knows how to simulate a fight for a film.<br/><br/>Renée Zellweger gives a surprisingly good performance as Mae, the wife of Jimmy. At one (possibly more) point of the film, she tells Crowe that when he is in the ring being hit, it feels to her like she is being hit. Most of the time, when you hear the long-suffering wife character say something like this, it is comical. That one can fully empathise with Zellweger as she says this in Cinderella Man is testament to how well-scripted and well-acted her scenes with Crowe are. Paul Giamatti also gets to shine as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. For much of the film, we see Gould as being simply a trainer and facilitator, looking down his nose at the thoroughly working-class Braddock. Then in one amazing scene, we learn just how intense the pinch of the Great Depression really was, and how much Gould really had invested in what he thought up until recently was a man past his prime. In a sense, the film works especially because of how powerful a performance these two put in.<br/><br/>The weak spot in the film is the portrayal of Max Baer. Yes, Max was a mountain of muscle who loved to punch his opponents into submission. Yes, Max killed two men in the ring. Where Cinderella Man errs is that it portrays Max Baer as having bragged extensively about the incident, even to the point of insulting Braddock's wife. Baer's son claims that Baer senior was haunted by the death of his opponent in the ring, and often wept about it. There is some corroboration to this account, but even without it, one has to consider that killing opponents in the ring and bragging about it is bad for a boxer's business. Not to mention that it is difficult to believe a man born in 1937 would say this about his dad if there weren't a fair chunk of truth to it. The essential problem here is that Howard's film portrays Max Baer with no development and no second dimension. He is a caricature, and thus Jimmy Braddock's victory in the climactic scene is lessened by it. I won't go into all the films that have been made better by multidimensional villains, but I was quite disappointed by this lapse. It is shared by all Howard films, which cannot seem to function without the good guys being very good and the bad very bad.<br/><br/>It is for that reason I gave Cinderella Man an eight out of ten. It is not nearly in the same league as Crowe's other riches-rags-riches combat performance, but it is worth a look. With the competition it was up against, in fact, I am surprised it failed to make more money."

","Cinderella Man is the story of a Depression-era boxer and American hero Jim Braddock, but it contains enough love interest, family interest, and great-champion-of-the-people interest to satisfy most Saturday night out filmgoers. It's a total no-brainer, beautifully served up, and all the clichés delivered with such accurate emotional punch that you forgive it for being a tad unoriginal.<br/><br/>Gladiator and bar-brawl man Russell Crowe plays the lead role and Renée Zellweger puts in a good performance as the ideal and very loving wife that supports her husband through thick and thin. The story starts in 1928 when Braddock is doing quite well, but the depression hits and, with an injured hand, he is forced to work in the shipyard. He and his family live in fairly abject poverty until a lucky break enables him to make a comeback.<br/><br/>This is the working man's hero who never says a bad word, teaches his kids never to steal for food even when they are starving, and nobly gives back his social security money the minute he can afford to. Zellwegger is similarly faultless of course, striking the right balance between supportiveness and concern that her man could get his brains knocked out permanently. The last fight generates quite a lot of genuine excitement due largely to neat editing and intense cinematography - you can almost feel your nose bleed just watching it.<br/><br/>This is classic American-style hero creation and worship and, on the face of it, healthy enough. So why the doubts? Sure you can sit back and just enjoy it, it's the type of story the U.S. has done well for a long time; but compare it with European cinema and it all seems very full of absolutes. The heroes don't have any failings. The choice is between total success and total failure, no half measures. Much as I admire the use of role models, I somehow wonder if more human heroes aren't sometimes called for, people who do quite well, who sincerely better themselves and others, but without becoming the most applauded individual on the continent. In watching the big picture we sometimes miss the detail that makes life real to everyone, not just the lucky few."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","18","25","14 January 2006"," 'Seabiscuit' In Human Form
","Wow, this was an involving story and the best boxing movie I think I've ever seen, and I've seen most of them. <br/><br/>It's an old-fashioned underdog rags-to-riches sports story about a very likable hero, heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock, played fantastically by Russell Crowe. This is another ""Seabiscuit,"" meaning a true-life tale of longshot going up against extraordinary odds. <br/><br/>More than the boxing, however, this is a great family story of a devoted husband and father and a loving, supporting wife and mother. That's the crux of this biography, more than the boxing angle. Nothing but the highest of morals and ethics are espoused by our hero here, who would starve himself rather see his children miss a meal, while teaching his kids honesty and unselfishness and doing whatever it took to take care of his family. Renee Zellweger also shines as Braddock's wife. After a string of some sleazy roles, it's nice to see Zellweger play this type of character. The two make an inspiring couple which is refreshing to see in this age of cynical film-making. This is another reason why I label this an old-fashioned story. The primary subject's strengths, not flaws, are emphasized.<br/><br/>Is it exaggerated? Probably, but I have no complaints seeing a good guy look better instead of worse. One gets tired of the modern-day age of the ""anti-hero."" It's nice once again to see a good man propped up instead of shot down.<br/><br/>The third major character in the film is ""Joe Gould"" (Paul Giamatti), Braddock's trainer and loyal friend. Unfortunately, he spits out the Lord's name in vain so many times I lost count, the only objectionable aspect of this film. But Gould was the kind of friend every guy would want.<br/><br/>Craig Bierko gets fourth billing as Max Baer, the reigning heavyweight champ whom Braddock has to beat to get the title. Now here is where I would not be surprised if his movie character was nothing like real life because Hollywood has to have a ""bad guy"" to counteract the ""good guy"" so here it is Baer, the last obstacle in the way of Braddock's quest to be heavyweight champion. Whatever the real Baer was like I don''t know but I know Bierko does a great job in this role.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes, supervised by real-life Hall Of Fame trainer Angelo Dundee, are lifelike and well-done. Crowe did a wonderful job of imitating Braddock's ring style.<br/><br/>The story isn't the only thing that is entertaining. Visually, this is a wonderful treat for your eyes. It's simply beautiful and director Ron Howard really excelled in capturing the 1930s Depression era with some beautifully muted colors. The sets are fantastic and the clothing, cars, buildings, etc put you smack in the middle of the 1930s. There are great production values in this film and the DVD does it all justice with a fabulous transfer on widescreen DVD."

It's ""beautifull"" to see that 2 people stand a long time on their love. But in this movie you get a view of results of the depression, where hunger and soberness is normal. <br/><br/>Maybe the story sounds like the Rocky sequence but this is different stuff. The come back and suffering from the early 30's can't be compared to the Rocky culture.<br/><br/>I always have problems with macho guys.

Generally, when I go in with high expectation (and this film was the one I was most looking forward to this year) I come out more than a little disappointed, although the films are often good, they rarely live up to my rampant anticipation. Cinderella Man, however, exceeded all my expectations. <br/><br/>Russel Crowe, who, since Master and Commander has been my favorite actor, outdoes any of his performances to date. He has clearly lost weight, he seemingly effortlessly picked up an accent, and his attitude is flawlessly proud, browbeaten, and unendingly strong. When he first loses his license to box at the beginning of the film he conveys, without shoving anything in our face, his sense of disappointment that he cannot provide for his family. He works furiously on the docks with a broken hand and still cannot keep his house heated. So at last, in one of the most moving moments of the film, he does what he would almost rather die than do, goes to his old friends and asks them for money. <br/><br/>I do not want to give away too many details of the film. But I can say, it is the best in years and, although i doubt it will because of A Beautiful Mind, it should win more than a few Oscars."

"don-lockwood","7","7","9","12 November 2005"," Certainly good, but more standard than sweeping
","With Ron Howard directing and Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti starring, Cinderella Man was sure to be a worthwhile cinematic experience, if only it hadn't been released in the unsuitable summer months of blockbuster fever. It didn't help that previous DreamWorks summer hit Seabiscuit starred a horse (and was more emotionally uplifting without being too violent or predictable), or that Cinderella Man was preceded by last year's Oscar winner Million Dollar Baby or the lackluster NBC reality series The Contender. But even when taken out of context, Cinderella Man is a fine, elaborately and accurately produced (if minimalistic) Depression-era boxing-pic love story that simply doesn't go where no great movie hasn't gone before.<br/><br/>Crowe, as always, gave a studied performance that reflected his involved physical and mental preparation, not to mention his accent! Zellweger, I thought, was the most underrated of the bunch because she really held her own opposite Crowe, stealing many of his scenes as the heart-tugging emotional core of the story. Giamatti's supporting perf should earn him his first (and overdue) Oscar nomination, since it was a fun, snarky kind of role infused with vigor and heart - great for a character actor. Otherwise, though, Ron Howard's direction might have made an already unoriginal subject matter more predictable. Still, it was, without a doubt, a good movie, if not a great one - a film that was well-made, if neither innovative nor emotionally sweeping."

","I just saw the movie tonight at a special advanced screening here in Newport Beach, and it is so good. I cannot tell you one single performance in the film that wasn't terrific. I can only think of a couple negatives. One being the man coughing behind me the WHOLE time. In terms of the movie, the section where the Braddocks suffer in the Depression went on pretty long, and the Braddock's kids were WAY too cute. A little shamelessly so. As in, no three kids are that well-behaved,loving and adorable ALL THE TIME. Great points: There were a lot more funny moments than i had expected, but none were cheap laughs, all were just honest and nice little moments. The acting and directing are just incredible. Renee Zellweger, Russel Crowe, Paul Giamatti (who practically steals the show), even Craig Bierko as the boxing nemesis were so great! Oscars FOR EVERYONE!

","Great movie. Crowe is in for another Oscar. Coming close on the heels of million dollar baby and surviving is massive. Comparisons would be obvious but it stands apart as one of the boxing great movies though at times moving but great performances by Crowe and Renee. The movie may not be a top contender for an Oscar but Crowe and Renee sure are. A lot of people have filled in a lot of details so I guess I won't go there. But I particularly like that scene when Braddock is to fight Max and they meet in the hotel and later Mae is shown cleaning the dishes. Very true depiction of the era. Money's worth by all means though some scenes are very graphic and could have been avoided but I guess Crowe (or his directors) like gore just as in gladiator. The fight with Max is very well shown like history being retold. Roles like this come once in a career and Renee has given a winning punch. Lets see if the Oscar pundits agree."
"tedg","Null","12","18","1 November 2006"," Fighting Intents
","Here's an interesting situation. Evil versus good, or if you prefer: a life of the purehearted versus that of the thuggish.<br/><br/>Yes, its the story, but its also the form of the movie itself.<br/><br/>The blunt, the stupid, the ugly is the movie itself. Howard and Grazier are so pedestrian it makes me cry. There isn't a shred of sophistication, elaboration or depth in this. Its one arc, unimpeded and unarticulated. Good man, Hard times, Comeback. The only slight elaboration is the worried-wife-as-watcher. Compare this to the richly woven ""Seabiscuit,"" essentially the same story but with all sorts of parallel threads and reflections.<br/><br/>These two guys Howard and Grazier are the enemy of life with their industrial storytelling, their plywood narrative. It makes it all the worse that they have achieved a glossy style that looks competent, if you think manufactured cookies with artificial ingredients are competent. Zellweger is not a fine actress, so she goes with the manufactured sweep of the thing.<br/><br/>The good which opposes it. Say what you will about Crowe's strutting, the man is an Australian actor and there's no escaping that. Even when told to be simple, and even in spite of his own imperfect and unformed soul, he just cannot avoid some depth, some parallel being  a reality under the cartoon. <br/><br/>And also on the good side is the simple fact of boxing. Now boxing is brutal. And perhaps most people involved in it are simple. But they are real, and that's all the difference. And it is a real sport, perhaps the only real one. No complex rules and balls. No question of goals or finish lines, just a straightforward matter of the ability to give and take. Its genuine, and I'm sure that's why it was selected, to counter the cartoon limits of what the filmmaker could handle. And since Scorsece mapped the ring and Stallone in vented the slomo flying sweat, its been cinematic as well.<br/><br/>So Its unintuitive that somethings that seem thuggish: Crowe and boxing, are the real things here, the pure and the good. And the bad, the evil, the thuggish; why they are our men behind the camera who make money from simplifying it for the goobs on the street. <br/><br/>Who will win this fight, do you suppose?<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","it's difficult for me to make a well-informed assessment of this biopic about James Braddock, because i wasn't there. i'm an ardent history buff though, and i know something about the ""dirty thirties"" from anecdotes and text books.this was beautifully crafted with it's sepia tones and shadowed images, the presence of radios and the poverty that was so much a part of the decade. what powered this film was the great performance by Russell Crowe. if indeed Mr Braddock had this kind of class, Russell brought it forward with his toned down, self-effacing yet proud countenance. and once again, Paul Giamatti was terrific as his manager. Paul is always great and i'd love to see him get acknowledgment for his body of work. Renee Zellweger was OK too, surprisingly credible with black hair. i didn't watch any of Max Baer's fights, and i know nothing about him other than he was world champion and his son was Jethro on the BH's. but i can understand why his family would take exception to his portrayal as a man who enjoyed womanizing, was disrespectful of women and basically everyone, and relished killing people in the ring. did he? was he? one thing i've noticed about Ron Howard is how he glosses over things. he's all Hollywood, and really who can blame him? he grew up in it's milieu. he's no Fernando Meirelles or Terrance Malick and he doesn't pretend to be. Mr Howard likes to entertain, and he's such an amiable fellow, hard to resist. all in all, this is a better-than-average boxing movie about a gracious, classy, humble man who loved his family and represented the little guy who could. Quite a Stretch for Russell. not in the same league as Raging Bull (what is?)nor Million Dollar Baby, about as good as Somebody Up There Likes Me, better than the Rockies and Ali. i'd recommend it, for the performances, and the look and feel of the thirties. even though i knew how it ended, i still found myself cheering."

","Why use real stories if you are going to ""make it better"" with lies? Just makeup your own original story and leave history alone. Couldn't we have cheered on the underdog without defaming the character of his opponent? It is an unnecessary detraction from the storyline to make it so black and white, feeds unsuspecting readers a lie that a generation comes to believe as truth, and creates a great deal of sorrow and pain for those who knew and loved Max Baer. Like a Beautiful Mind the truth has been twisted to tell a good story. Read the real stories of Nash and Baer. Nash's life was far more interesting and complex, he paid many times for his disease and certainly did not sit around the house and the college all those years till he could get back his life. It was a process that was far more interesting, less beautiful, and more really like schizophrenia than Howard's production. People said ""He made me really know what it is like to be schizophrenic."" Ha ha. Read the real story if you REALLY want to know what it is like to be schizophrenic. And look at the truth about the evil ""Black Bart"" Baer before deciding about the man.

","""Cinderella Man""  WOW! ""Cinderella Man"" cast  WOW! ""Cinderella Man"" script  WOW! WOW, WOW, WOW  what a movie! <br/><br/>The new film ""Cinderella Man"" is the true story of boxer James J. (Jim) Braddock. This film is stunning and exciting from beginning to end. In my opinion, it's the best movie so far in 2005, and it may well be the second boxing movie in two years to win the Academy's nod for Best Picture. How can I say this? Well, Russell Crowe as Braddock has never been better. Incredible! Director Ron Howard also gets terrific performances from Renée Zellweger as Braddock's wife, Mae, and from talented actor Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould.<br/><br/>What a lucky hit and maybe it was more than luck that reunited Academy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, director Ron Howard, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (all Oscar winners for 2001's ""A Beautiful Mind"") with Oscar winner Russell Crowe. What a team and what a story! The film recreates the pain of the dark days of 1930s Depression in a way that will stir you to the core. Braddock, a once-promising heavyweight boxer, struggles along with wife Mae to survive and hold their family together. Braddock's impressive run of wins has been surpassed by a string of losses that has rendered him a ring has-been, grubbing for any kind of work. Then an unlikely stroke of good fortune  a last minute cancellation  offers Braddock one more night in the ring against a second-ranked world contender. Unbelievable  except it really happened  Braddock, with no training for the fight, wins that match. Everywhere in the country, this new hero  who is one of their own  uplifts the downtrodden people living through this terrible time. Those controlling the matches can't ignore Braddock's popularity and the potential for profit as the old man is brought back to fight young savages who will probably kill him. (Shades of ""Million Dollar Baby""!)<br/><br/>You'll be on the edge of your seat for the whole play-out. If you're a boxing fan, you probably know what happens  but I won't spoil it for you if you don't know. Either way, don't miss this dream moviea true-life fairy tale.

","Perhaps I had a bad day yesterday before I sat down to watch ""Cinderella Man"", but let me try to convince you why I did not really like this film a lot.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this film. I tried to really get into the Depression-era feel and the ""feel-good-everyman"" riches-to-rags to riches story of Jimmy Braddock, the underdog-cum-heavyweight-champion who outlasted a younger, more deadly Max Baer in 1935. This film is perhaps is the most historically realistic and visually stunning film that Ron Howard has ever directed. It may also be the most ambitious film that Brian Grazer and Penny Marshall have ever been involved in, including Marshall's ""A League of Their Own""). ""Cinderella Man"" has every stylistic element in the book going for it. Production design, costuming, set design, general casting, art direction, and music was created by the likes of people who made ""Chicago"", ""A Beautiful Mind"" (which I call ""A Beautiful Lie"", and if I have time one day I will write about why I call it that)"",""Apollo 13"",""Do the Right Thing"", and countless other great movies. This film has more heavyweight talent backing it up than Mohammed Ali every carried into a boxing ring during the height of his career. This film has the painted-portrait ambiance of Depression Era New York City.<br/><br/>What could possibly be wrong with ""Cinderella Man""?<br/><br/>For me, the real problem is that I have seen this kind of movie too many times before. Remove Sylvester Stallone's self-effacing ""bad-side-of-the-tracks"" Italian untermensch and insert Russell Crowe with his well-practiced but overly-understated Jersey accent and you have ""Rocky I"". Replace Rene Zellweger's half-Betty-Boop, half-horrible-imitation-of-Cyndi-Lauper rendition of Braddock's wife, Mae with Talia Shire, and you have Rocky's wife Adrienne from that same film. Paul Giamatti, who plays Braddock's manager, must have imitated every bad 1930's and 1940's formula picture actor to smooth out the stilted and wisecracking dialog he is given in this film. Let's also just be frank. Brain Grazer was one of the people responsible for the remake of ""Psycho"" which should, by law, prevent him from ever making another film in his life, if justice were truly blind. This film, basically, was made by a group of recyclers. This film is the equivalent of an EPA ""Super Fund"" project for cinematographers.<br/><br/>In short, just about everything in ""Cinderella Man"" is too perfect. It is the same thing we get from Ron Howard every time (with the possible exception of ""Apollo 13""). It's the same old substance-less sentimentality wrapped up in a lovely cinematic package that we got in Cocoon, Splash, Far and Away, Willow, and countless other Howard projects.<br/><br/>The real imperfections come from the extended length of the film, the predictable dialog, and the severe over-emoting of Renee Zellweger's Mae Braddock character at the end of the film. I am almost certain Ron Howard studied ""Rocky II"" a little too long when he copied the feel of the Stallone sequel for the last portion of this film. I also honestly believe the casting crew could have hired Cyndi Lauper for a lot less and gotten a better performance from her than they got from Ms. Zellweger in this movie. At least Ms. Lauper came from the same neighborhood upon which this film was based. She could even have been made up to look younger. Ms. Lauper also wouldn't have had to fake the Jersey smirk that Ms. Zellweger had to practice for months prior to doing this film.<br/><br/>I am also tired of seeing Clint Howard, who still looks too young for his age, in any movie, let alone trying to portray a character much older than his age. Perhaps, when Ron Howard dies and no one else will hire him to act, he can write that New York Times Best Seller ""I Was Opie's Brother"". Until then, we will have to continue to endure his presence. (If you want to see Clint Howard in something truly funny, watch ""Evilspeak"", which is perhaps one of the worst horror films ever made).<br/><br/>The politically correct will also likely be angry at the casting and make-up job of Craig Bierko as Max Baer, as well as his portrayal as a violent villain. This will be the second film in which Russell Crowe has been cast either as a character with supposed anti-Semitic views (John Nash) or opposing someone who supported Jewish causes like Baer (even though ethnically questionable to some). I have read that the Star of David was minimized on Baer's trunks to minimize any racial or religious association with Baer's trumped-up villainy in this film. Baer was more clown than villain in real life and was horribly shaken up by the deaths in the ring that he caused. And let's not forget, he was Jethro Bodine's (Max Baer, Junior's) dad. He could only be so mean, if you catch my drift. <br/><br/>In the final analysis, we get what we always get from Ron Howard. We get the feel of eating fine prime rib when in reality we are simply sucking on dry cardboard. He has built one more fantastic cacophony of sound and fury, signifying nothing.<br/><br/>This will be a wonderful film to rent at home, but I would save my money and not see this one in the theater. It will no doubt do well and I am certain the DVD will go into production very shortly after the film's theater run and will also be successful.<br/><br/>I just think there are better films out there somewhere worth dodging commuter traffic to see on the big screen."

","""In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of J J. Braddock"".<br/><br/><ul><li>Damon Runyan.</li></ul><br/><br/>Rags to riches films are notoriously divisive amongst critics and fans alike, often tagged derogative wise as Awards Baiters, one could be forgiven for thinking that uplifting pictures have no place in cinema society. On the surface, Cinderella Man was always going to struggle to totally capture the movie loving world. It's directed by Ron Howard, who seems to forever be charged with the crime of lacing his puddings with too much sugar, and it's written by the person who brought us Batman & Robin! So not a good start there for many. Add into the equation that Russell Crowe stars as Braddock, at a time when Crowe was gaining unfavourable press for anger issues and a love of poetry: And also that it's yet another boxing movie, this film was disliked before it had even been released. Which is a mighty shame as the finished product is a triumph of acting and story telling nous, in fact inspiring probably isn't the word to do it total justice.<br/><br/>Much like with Apollo 13, Howard has managed to grab a story with a known ending and mold it into a heavyweight champion of a picture. Set as it is in the Great Depression, the amount of sentiment and heart tugging is naturally very high, but what would you have Howard do? Forgo the feeling of the time and Braddock's real life situation? Perhaps in favour of filler scenes that have no actual worth? Cinderella Man has no agenda other than to tell this incredible story of a good honest family man struggling to make ends meet. With a heart of a lion and a chin quarried from granite, Braddock {brilliantly realised by the irrepressible Crowe} went from top to bottom and rose like a phoenix to defy the odds and stun the boxing world at a time when morale was particularly low for many. This is no Rocky Balboa bunting strewn fanfare picture, this is a real story, from a real period, expertly told by all involved.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Cinderella Man is a perfect piece, it most definitely isn't. My personal complaint rests with not fully fleshing out the friendship between Braddock and Mike Wilson, with the almost unforgivable crime of underusing the talent of Paddy Considine {Wilson} entered on to the charge sheet. Craig Bierko as the murderously ruthless champion boxer, Max Baer, has obviously studied the character, getting the movements of the champ down pat, but he just never fully convinces as a real life boxer of note, something that Crowe most assuredly manages to do. But they are minor quibbles to me, and offset by the wonderful Paul Giamatti as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould, every sequence featuring just him and Crowe are real cinema high points; an acting tour de force from two very talented men. A special mention has to go to Renee Zellweger, who as Braddock's devoted wife, gets arguably the toughest role in the picture, that she leaves a firm and emotionally enlightening impression is with much credit to the pretty and undervalued Texan.<br/><br/>Rags to riches films are here to serve a purpose, they exist and will continue to be made because the world sometimes needs reminders that love, hope and respect can reign supreme, especially in trying and troubled times. Cinema is actually a form of medicine, especially when grounded in facts. Is it right to deny yourself a tonic when the need arises? Of course not, thankfully those involved with Cinderella Man knew exactly what to prescribe for the story of J J. Braddock. 9/10"
"rowmorg","2","17","30","21 March 2006"," Typical journey through the formatted mangle
","Another boxing movie? Can nobody think of anything new? Obviously the Depression era is total news to today's Americans, but nary a hint in this picture that an economic depression is anything more than a force of nature, like the weather. Nor is there the slightest indication of any solution of the New Deal kind --- heaven forbid.<br/><br/>Braddock and his wife are depicted as the ideal working class couple: devoted, devout and dutiful. Yep, it's ""family values"" territory. Wifey stays at home and takes in sewing (although we never see her sewing anything). Hubbie goes down and tries his luck as a navvy at the docks, when he can't get in a legal punch-up at Madison Square Gardens to earn some extra cash. It's enough to make the Bible belt go weak at the knees.<br/><br/>When he is driven in desperation to take a welfare hand-out Braddock is depicted as profoundly humiliated and ashamed, and he actually turns up later with a wad of cash and pays it back --- as if his taxes and the human rights of his children did not merit the welfare payments. The conservative financiers of this picture (Ron Meyer/Universal and Miramax/Disney) would have lapped this up.<br/><br/>I recommend to anyone fascinated by the climactic bout of this long, women-oriented flick to watch the video of the real thing that is included in the DVD package. They will see a sporting bout with no fireworks, and only a couple of sharp blows landed by either fighter. There's a clear winner on points and both fighters shake gloves at the end.<br/><br/>In particular, they may be surprised to see in the genuine film the Baer character shown wearing a prominent Star of David on his trunks. Baer wore the star in honour of his Jewish father (although he was raised Catholic) when he fought Hitler's favourite boxer, Schmeling, and wore it thereafter. The star is unnoticeable in the movie's preposterously distorted version of the match, presumably because Baer was being built up as the big villain.<br/><br/>In short the picture is a travesty, not only of the Depression era, but also of boxing history. Definitely avoidable."

","Though Cinderella Man got great critical notices it did not do well at the box office which is a shame for those who missed a great sports story and Russell Crowe's performance as James J. Braddock.<br/><br/>Between the time Gene Tunney retired in 1928 and Joe Louis ascended to boxing's heavyweight championship, there were a succession of champions who were not among the greatest, but who in and of themselves had some interesting stories. In order they were, Max Schmeling, Jack Sharkey, Primo Carnera, Max Baer and finally the working class champion James J. Braddock. Most of these guys fought each other and Joe Louis in fact on his way up the ladder fought and licked all of them except most notoriously Schmeling.<br/><br/>Jim Braddock was a promising light heavyweight in the late twenties who got a title shot against champion Tommy Loughran and lost. As is the usual pattern of things, Braddock went gradually downhill and at the same time injured his right hand. This was the Great Depression and Braddock took work on the docks as a longshoreman to support his wife and family.<br/><br/>Ron Howard did a fine job in recreating the era of Braddock and got a great performance out of Russell Crowe as the man. What Crowe gives you as Braddock is the real deal. Crowe nearly won an Oscar on the strength of a very touching scene with one of his children who he caught stealing a loaf of bread. Economics were bad, but Braddock's values stood the test.<br/><br/>I suppose it was a matter of necessity, every heroic story has to have a villain and poor Max Baer's reputation suffers as a result of it. Craig Bierko is fine as Max Baer, but he did not give you the real Max at all. Baer was a savage puncher and in fact was responsible for the death of two men in the ring. Ron Howard shows him as a man with no regrets about that. In fact Baer was deeply affected by the deaths and held his punches on many occasions because of it.<br/><br/>Baer was however a party animal who loved a good time above all. That was his undoing in his real career and in the film. <br/><br/>Viewers will also like Paul Giamatti as Braddock's shrewd and loyal manager Joe Gould. Giamatti's performance might seem a caricature yet boxing manager were and are very much like Joe Gould, at least the best of them.<br/><br/>As a personal story and a sports story Cinderella Man rates as one of the best films so far in this new millenia of our's. I wouldn't miss it when it's broadcast. Too bad that so many folks did miss it on the big screen."

","Let's get one thing out of the way right off...this isn't a movie about boxing. This is a movie about family, about the real responsibilities of being a parent, about meeting those responsibilities. Yes, boxing is the canvas and it is presented with no romance or softness. But the focus of this film is Jim Braddock and his wife Mae and how they faced and triumphed as a family in the face of horrible challenges. It has heart, humor and horror of life on the edge. The acting is uniformly superb. Russell Crowe once again shows his mastery of the small moment, the subtle facial expressions, the power of the eyes. Rene Zellwegger rises to his challenge and puts in a surprisingly restrained and powerful performance as his partner in life. Their children are allowed to be children, not sassy Hollywood smart mouths. While many in the supporting roles shine, Paul Giamatti is brilliant as manager Joe Gould. He and Russell create a rapport the likes of Hope and Crosby. This is a movie for adults and those with adult sensibilities. If all you want is special effects, pass this by. If you want a thrilling piece of entertainment that will transport you to another time and place, if you want acting at its best, this is the movie for you."
"elcopy","2","9","14","19 June 2005"," Split decision
","It seems today anything done by the Crowe-Howard combo is going to get rave reviews. ""Cinderella Man"" is a pretty good movie, just not a magnificent one. The script is paint-by- numbers. Renée Zellweger was as best mediocre (she has the most embarrassing line in the movie: ""You're the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!"") the rest of the acting was pretty good, but not as good as other past performances by Crowe and Giamatti.<br/><br/>A terrible mistake in the movie was the demonization of champion Max Baer, who was as beloved as Braddock back in the day. As if the poverty and humiliation of Braddock wasn't enough to carry a story of redemption and second chances, they had to bring a villain. That's so Hollywood.<br/><br/>Finally, there are two bigger problems with ""Cinderella Man"": The uplifting, true, sport story about people who win back a second chance from the Great Depression was seen years earlier in ""Seabiscuit"". The other problem is, despite being a true story, there was already a beloved boxer who came out of poverty and adversity to win our hearts. His name is Rocky. The real film version of this true story."
"cinemafilo","3","13","22","22 October 2005"," Unoriginal, melodramatic & manipulative hooey!
","I felt manipulated from beginning to end. The director and scriptwriter obviously do not respect the intelligence of their audience to manipulate us with such over the top melodrama. One example of the type of manipulation I am talking about is the scene with Crowe and the son when they are having the conversation that they will never give up their kids....and the son starts crying. Is this really necessary? They are poor, its hard times for the family....WE GET IT!!!Do we need to be hit over the head with this??I felt that so many of the elements in this film have been done before and done better in such films as ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"". The film never tried to be bold or original in its story telling.....it seemed just geared to please Oscar members...thats all. This film does not have the originality or complexity of other films released this year and SHOULD NOT be rewarded with any kind of nominations. If it does get noms...then Ron Howard will have succeeded in manipulating AMPAS. He didn't succeed in manipulating me and based on the mixed reviews and not entirely glowing reviews by most respectable critics.....he did not manipulate critics either."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","5","7","30 August 2006"," Dangerously close to being ""just another movie about boxing"", but the portrayal of an era saves it and Russell Crowe is great in roles like this
","Now I know Russell Crowe may be a jerk in reality, but he clearly knows his stuff on screen so we can move past that. As a buff, bare-chested Gladiator-hero with a big ol' softie heart for his family, we love him in this film. It is set during the depression in the 1930s New York. The fact that he isn't fighting for glory but for for survival immediately makes his struggle much more poignant, and Ron Howard's Cinderella Man (2005) rides on this advantage throughout  this desperate depression time that drives a man to desperate measures.<br/><br/>I think boxing is a truly inhumane sport. It shouldn't even qualify as a sport; it's two people inflicting maximum damage on each other. But Jim Bradock (that's Russell Crowe)'s fighting is something different  this isn't something he does for fun. In the beginning, after having lost a boxing match, a sponsor-person tells him ""Go home to your kids, Bradock"" to which Braddock replies, ""Go home? Go home with what?"" He needs to do it and it is apparent in the fighting.<br/><br/>So in spite of my dislike for boxing, I have to credit this film for its dynamic, fast-paced and realistic games that even surpass those of Million Dollar Baby (2004). It's pretty damn exciting. Another plus for this film that elevates it above generic sports-movie formula is its setting. The murky, barren feel of the Depression invests the scenes in a kind of simplicity that is only ever present in Dogme 95. It places the environment in the backseat, with minimal visuals flair to detract, to make room for its realistic characters that consume the film. <br/><br/>Ultimately, The Cinderella Man is a well-crafted and often entertaining film but it is extremely standard, safe, predictable, logical, been-there-done-that  there are no puzzling detours, twists, or unusual character developments. Sure, it is grounded as a reality-based biography but there is NO flair. Another director could have had more fun with the script. You've seen it all before, the build-up to that one final fight with the most ferocious and feared boxer, the wife's concern, not following the coach's instructions, the favouring crowd.<br/><br/>Lastly, I have one more complaint: Cinderella Man could easily have been at least 40 minutes shorter. Not because it dawdled exactly, but by concentrating the key scenes into a shorter version, it would have been even more poignant.<br/><br/>7/10"
"WalterFrith","Null","5","7","16 July 2006"," Genteel and cheerful boxing movie.
","As boxing movies go, this one certainly can't compare to 2004's 'Million Dollar Baby' or the original 'Rocky'. However, Russell Crowe is convincing in the role of Jim Braddock, a man struggling to reach the top of his profession and while the underdog story has been done to death, audiences still love it because they always see themselves in their heroes' role. I liked the subject matter and the idea of the film a lot more than its execution, which admittedly, is flawed. Depression era people struggling to make something out of their lives. Crowe's children in the film represent my father's family and his siblings growing up. Something I've learned about in my life, and I'm glad there are those with big hearts like director Ron Howard, still brave enough to make these films in an era when no one seems to care about the impoverished anymore."

","The latest film from director Ron Howard follows the Depression-era boxing career of Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), who retires after a number of defeats. Because he still has to support his wife (Renée Zellweger) and children, Braddock returns to boxing when he has a chance to fill-in for someone in a high profile match. His unexpected win over the #1 contender begins a series of victories that get the masses behind this true-life underdog.<br/><br/>I love underdog movies. They're predictable and safe but still enjoyable and heartwarming. Cinderella Man is the perfect example of a good underdog story. It does feature a bunch of clichés but the film wins the viewer over by the end. I think Ron Howard is a very good director. He kept the film on a familiar path but he still kept it entertaining. He could have edited the movie though. It was overlong and the 140 minutes was not necessary at all. It didn't take away from the quality of the film too much though. Howard portrayed the good guy well, making him extremely likable. I didn't like the way the ""bad guy"" was portrayed though. In real life, Max Baer was a nice person but in Cinderella Man, he's portrayed as a cold and vile man. It was an unfair portrayal and Ron Howard shouldn't have gone over the top with it.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes were exciting and well done. Howard captured the danger, fortitude and skill involved in boxing. The first half of the film was a little slow but still nicely done. The second half was faster and not as depressing. The ending was nicely done and very heartwarming. The film wasn't perfect though. The family scenes were too melodramatic. They all fell flat and the actors portraying the three kids weren't very good. There were also a few other cheesy moments that slowed the movie down. I blame screenwriter Akiva Goldsman for this. In my opinion, he's a weak writer and it amazes me that he was able to win an Oscar.<br/><br/>The acting was great and pretty much everyone gave a good performance. Paul Giamatti gave a very engaging performance as Joe Gould. It was intense, realistic and he put a lot of soul into the role. Russell Crowe played Jim Braddock extremely well. His off screen behavior is questionable but he still delivers some nice performances. Renée Zellweger was just as good as Crowe and it's surprising that neither of them received nominations. After seeing Craig Bierko in Scary Movie 4, it was a little hard to take him seriously as Max Baer. He gave just an okay performance. In my opinion, Cinderella Man was a strong and heartwarming film but it wasn't anything amazing either. It was far from bland but it wasn't best picture worthy either. In the end, Cinderella Man is a fine film that's worth checking out. Rating 7/10"

","Heavyweight champ James J. Braddock looks back on his humble beginnings: in the Depression Era as a washed-up boxer with a broken hand and a revoked license, he struggles to take care of his wife and three kids before making a miraculous comeback. Director Ron Howard builds every scene as something extraordinary, while his throwaway bits (such as a married couple fighting in front of a church, or a man walking out on his wife) are hammered home with little subtlety. Howard constructs the film disappointingly, with a flashback segue intervening about seven minutes in, and with principal actors who look pained, perplexed or disinterested. Renée Zellweger, playing Braddock's fiercely devoted wife Mae (who sews under a single lamp while her kids always seem to be in bed), is stuck with lines like, ""When you get hit, I feel it, too"". This is the passive, loving wifey movie fans have seen since the beginning of time, and Zellweger does absolutely nothing original with the part; Russell Crowe has some strong scenes as Braddock, but our introduction to him, smugly collecting his money after a fight, is curiously sour. He and Zellweger have no screen chemistry whatsoever, and their dialects and acting styles clash. The smaller roles are filled with scenery-chewing overachievers, and Howard is shameless in allowing them to hold nothing back (everything is done 'colorfully', for effect, and the film plays like a ham sandwich). This true story comes hilariously ""pre-approved"" with a quote from Damon Runyan, with period detail that is careful but disappointing. The whole enterprise suffers from boxing fatigue. ** from ****"

","I don't know how many times I watched this movie. But the truth is it still entertains me. The movie clearly shows the pains and struggles that James Braddock had to face in his real life. Instead of picturing it as a mere sports flick, Ron Howard has tried to jell it with family elements, which immensely helped in elevating the quality of the overall movie. Russel Crow has given a solid performance, whereas it is Rene Zellweger and Paul Gimatti who wows me with their stellar performance. The boxing scenes were absolutely jaw dropping and thrilling enough to feel the intensity of the match. I would say this as a ""Must watch"" movie in the sports genre."

It's much more exciting seeing him win you want him to succeed and see his dream of coming back become true. <br/><br/>Braddock's story is more moving because he wants to fight for his family to make them feel secure and never be hungry again. <br/><br/>The performances are fantastic especially Russell Crowe and the actor who played his trainer. He is funny and you like him as much as Braddock because he also is doing this for his wife so you see him having a lot in common with James so his care for him is genuine not just coach and boxer but you see a real friendship between them.<br/><br/>Rocky is not bad by any means but like I said this one is much better mainly due to being based on a true story"

I can't agree with those who complain about the fact that this film was ""over-emotional"". If the life of a man who got from working on the docks and not being able sometimes to provide food for his children to winning the heavyweight crown doesn't strike you as extraordinarily emotional, then you must be as sensitive as a kitchen knife.

","first thought around midsection of the movie for me was how similar this was to rocky balboa. had that same kinda ""i'm too old for this s***"" feel, but this time, i couldn't help but feel more strongly for Jim because losing the fight would mean more than him just losing his pride. throughout the second half of the movie, there were constant references to the Max's 2 fatal victims, and u can't help but feel for Jim's life, and his family, more than u care about him winning (at least for me).<br/><br/>i think the family emotions came on pretty strong, and both Renee and Crowe did a great job of putting it together. excellent acting on both their parts. somehow, it made a boxing movie less about the brutality than it was about the heart and spirit of the masses behind what the commoner perceived as a representative to their woes.<br/><br/>i do agree with a previous poster though that it started out kinda slow, but i feel it was necessary in creating the kind of endearing family bonding that Jim, Mae and the 3 kids have. throughout the first half i was constantly asking myself: "" this guy's a boxer? well he ain't looking the part, but he's sure got a soul and a heart."" great movie, just made my day."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","2","2","26 June 2007"," A simple, moving and very human story about surviving and triumph
","Ron Howard's 'Cinderella Man' is the story of of Depression-era prize-fighter James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) and his wife Mae Braddock (Renee Zellweger). Howard gives us a glimpse through the ups and downs of their lives. In the beginning we see the Braddocks as a happy family and then we see them during the depression era: James struggling to find work at the docks, his fighting with a broken hand, giving his daughter his breakfast meal, Mae watching her children get ill, she and the children stealing wood from the sign to provide warmthwe are provided with many such hard hitting scenes. We see James trying to keep his head high until despair wins over when he begs for money to get his children back. Through it all the family stick together and their love and devotion to one another keeps them strong. Then things take a turn for the better, when Gould (his former manager) comes up with an opportunity to box. Braddock is back in the ring and continues climbing the ladder to success. He does not let success corrupt him. The Braddocks remain aware of where they have come from. In a wonderful restaurant dinner scene, we see Mae slip some meat in her purse (to feed the children at home). Mae tries her best to be supportive but she fears for his life and her fears become more apparent when James agrees to fight Max Baer.<br/><br/>Howard's direction is good, nothing outstanding. There are several memorable scenes (some of which I've already mentioned) most of which is because of the actors' performances.<br/><br/>Credit goes to Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti for turning this movie from good to great. Crowe fits his character like a glove and delivers one of his finest performances. His restraint makes his character human. His chemistry with Zellweger and with Giamatti stand out and make the scenes memorable. Zellweger is gold. Can this actress ever go wrong? Giamatti is outstanding. Check out his facial expression in various scenes especially the one where he requests McGill to take Braddock back. Bruce McGill is adequate and Paddy Considine does well (though his plot appears to deviate). Craig Bierko's Max Baer seems more like a typical one-dimensional villain, but then again, this is not his story.<br/><br/>On the whole, this movie is more than worth a watch and one of my favorite 'boxing' movies. It's not just about winning but more about surviving. It's a wonderfully simple, moving and very human story even though it's predictable."

","This is a rich, poignant, full movie - full of real people, real life scenarios, real history, REALLY good performances and wonderful sets and camera work. I saw it yesterday afternoon and I am still affected by the sheer heart and soul of it. And, as Ron Howard can so magically do, I am still feeling a connection with the historical characters he brings to life on screen, such as in ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"". They linger in my mind as if I just spent a wonderful evening talking intimately with them over a few glasses of wine. Maybe it's because he deals with emotions in a direct and unsentimental fashion, and yet his respect for the human heart shines through. I dunno. I just know that I was deeply touched by this film from start to finish.<br/><br/>Also, I am so pleased to finally see Russell Crowe playing a decent man (not a bully, a madman or a gladiator) in a major motion picture that mainstream America will see. Anyone who hasn't seen his delicate and convincing work in ""Proof"" and ""The Sum of Us"" (both Australian releases) still don't have a clue about this man's range and the depth of character he can somehow bring to his roles. Between his reputation as a bar brawler and the powerhouse characters he is famous for, not many Americans know this side of the man. The heart, decency and love inside of Jim Braddock comes through so convincingly that you ache for him ~ you can feel every punch, every indignity, every moment of despair as if he were sitting next to you. And yet, you CARE so darn much, you can't turn away.<br/><br/>And Paul Giamatti (sp?) is incredible ~ funny, human, caring, cocky. This simply MUST be the year the Academy finally recognizes his work. His chemistry with Russell's character is very touching ~ even more so that with Renee Zellwegger (who does a credible job as the anxious wife.) This is a 'must see' because it will surely be talked about in the upcoming awards season. And see it on the big screen. The action is too good to miss."

And probably he wasn't laughing because he kill someone, but for sure what i see is the adrenaline going to top fighting to keep his championship. Or people expect him to knockout someone and been able to have lovely eyes. They are fighting not blessing the people.. So he was portrayed as he was a fighter.

Just watching this film inspires me to become a more wholesome man like Jim Braddock. The fight choreography is incredible, every fight looks as if you're the one receiving the punches to the face. The story is told masterfully, with the perfect combination of family, personal anguish and triumph, and ultimately, the perfect unfolding of Jim's quest for the title. I have always respected Ron Howard as a director, but Cinderella Man is a cut above anything else he's done before, including A Beautiful Mind.

","Let me start off by first saying this was a movie I had avoided seeing for a very long time. To be sure, I had heard many glowing reviews as well as some negative ones, but I'm not one to pay much attention to the opinions of movie critics; I would prefer to make up my own mind. As well, I'm not one to go for the ""heartwarming sports story"" type of film, as I find most of them to be unwatchable trash. So it was with much hesitation that I plucked this movie off the shelf and took it home for a look-see. <br/><br/>This movie possesses it's own quiet, understated beauty expressed a multitude of ways. The old-fashioned sepia tones used throughout lend an air of authenticity, evoking the atmosphere of the dirty thirties and suggesting the despair of the time. The dialogue of the characters comes across as very true to life to this viewer. I'm not talking about the dialogue being true to patterns of speech typical of depression era New Jersey. Rather, the interplay between different characters comes across as very real, much like what actual people in this situation would say and do.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man tells the story of James Braddock, a New Jersey boxer during the depression who, down on his luck, fights his way back into the ring after having his license revoked and finds himself scheduled to fight Max Baer, a man widely known as having killed two men in the ring. The daily struggle to survive waged by the Braddock family has taken it's toll on everyone, as it has with others in the neighborhood. James agrees to fight Baer out of financial desperation. <br/><br/>There are many memorable scenes in this film. However, the one which stands out in my mind has to be the one where James, determined to get his children back after farming them out because of an inability to provide for them, goes to the boxing commission to ask for money to turn the hydro back on. If ever there were doubts in my mind about Russell Crowe's ability as an actor, they disappeared as I watched him portray a husband and father forced to pack his pride and do the only thing which could be done to dig his family out of the pit they were in. Heartbreaking isn't a word I would normally use when describing a movie, but it's the only one I can think of to describe his growing awareness that he will have to risk his health and safety to put food on the table.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti provide support in their roles as Mae Braddock and Joe Gould, Braddock's manager, and both of them knock it out of the park, providing performances equal to Russell Crowe's.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet, watch this movie."

I have never seen this actor coming out so crystal clear.All over the movie has been carved beautifully under the back drops of economic crises in America in early 1930's.

"wishkah7","10","3","4","16 September 2006"," Another Oscar Worthy performance from Russell Crowe.
","I love boxing movies! Forget ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Against The Ropes"", Cinderella Man takes the cake! Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as Jim Braddock. A boxer who struggled to make ends meet to provide for his family during The Great Depression. He goes against a lot of boxers, including Max Baer, the famous boxer who's son went on to play Jethro from The Beverly Hillbillies. While he's struggling to get a job after injuring his hand, his family suffers from poverty, and has to go look for work. I recommend this movie for boxing fans, Russell Crowe fans, or fans of the sports genre. Too bad Cinderella Man only came in at #4 on the Top 5 Box Office. It should have won an Oscar. Russell Crowe should'V got the Oscar for his performance. Excellent movie!"

","This is easily the most underrated movie in film history. How could this have gotten snubbed so bad by the Academy? It's one of a few movies that literally sends chills down my spine when I watch it. It is a great story of what it means to be a good father, good husband, and most of all, a good person. It sends the viewer on an emotional roller coaster throughout the entire movie, and the suspense is at high levels throughout. You see Braddock at the both the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Crowe is perfect for this role, as is Giomatti for his character. And of course, Renee Zellweger captures the heart of us all as she tries to keep her composure in order to raise her family amidst the terror of the Depression. This movie cannot be missed. It is easily in my top 5 of best movies ever. Enjoy."
"Hitchcoc","9","3","4","21 April 2006"," Promotes the Human Element
","This is a story of a man, not just a boxer. We are never privy to all of the training and abuse Braddock must have been through. That's because we are as much a part of his family life and his dealings with the Depression as we are about the series of fights that he endured. He obviously was a great talent. The fact that he is held in such low esteem was a little surprising to me because he had not lost a fight. Granted, his injuries diminished his entertainment value and, as the film states, that's really what it was all about--tickets. <br/><br/>But the real substance of the movie is Braddock and his family and the scenes where a man couldn't get work, even though he was able bodied and committed to the work. My parents told me that the word ""depression"" was more than an economic term at that time. Hope was taken away. The character represented as Braddock managed to maintain hopefulness and even had to debase himself to keep his family together. He was like millions of men and women. You could only do so much to hold it together.<br/><br/>This is a film strong in cinematography. The fight sequences are very good. I don't know how anyone can step into a ring, knowing that another man is trying to knock your head off. The punches are seen landing. The endurance necessary to keep going for fifteen rounds had to be phenomenal. But the scenes of the depression are also beautiful framed. Not just the sadness but the joys people still create. The group birthday party when all the kids celebrated their birthdays on the same day was something I wasn't aware of. <br/><br/>See this movie. It has charm and pain and action. It never sells out."

","Hollywood has shown it's true colors. By not even nominating the movie that should have been the best picture of the year, we can really see that it's all politics. This movie was so unbelievably good, the acting was more than first rate, everyone in it should have won academy awards! Watching this movie, you really see what it was like to live during the depression, but you see the determination of this boxer, and the love he and his family members had for each other. It's a real feel-good movie, whether you like boxing or not (and I never did before.) There isn't a moment in the movie where my attention wasn't held. I couldn't turn away for a second. It made me want to watch it again as soon as it was over! The only thing I didn't like is that it makes Max Baer out to be a monster, and I know from older people who actually lived through this time and followed his career, that he wasn't. But that was it, the only thing about the movie that wasn't good. It was absolutely the best, and I would recommend it to anyone."

The fight scenes are intense and brutal - and quick! There are interesting additions including cool ""x-ray"" cut scenes where you can see the hits do inner damage. Plus, its a story with heart with a different type of ""boxing wife"" played by Renée Zellweger, Imagine : A BEAUTIFUL MIND meets ROCKY. Depite, really good reviews, it did really bad at the box-office.

"nycritic","8","3","4","24 March 2006"," Shameless, Manipulative, but it Works
","Yet another movie about the triumph of the spirit, filtered through the lens and overall vision of Ron Howard, and acted superbly by today's most masculine actor, Russell Crowe. This is the story of Jim ""Jimmy"" Braddock, and his rise from being down in the dumps during the Depression Era and becoming the biggest man in the world of boxing thanks to the solid support of his fierce manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti).<br/><br/>If it weren't such a well-told story and did not have the presence of Crowe and Giamatti, this would probably by a color-by-numbers tale of redemption. Ron Howard knows an audience and establishes a quick relationship with Braddock. He is seen as a stern but loving husband and father, a man who at the start of the film has to step down from boxing due to a hand injury which made him unbankable for business. In seeing him work the docks and in one painful scene, beg for money, we feel for him and root for his eventual success (even when many of us who may have read his bio know he went on to bigger and better things). The thing is, this story has been done one too many times to garner a moving outcome, so when the decisive fight between Braddock and Max Baer (Craig Bierko) takes place, there's the predictability of emotions but no real suspense. Our hero is a very good actor playing a dead role.<br/><br/>Even so, Cinderella MAN is a good film. Renee Zellweger brings in her own gutsy persona as Mae Braddock, which also benefits the film, but has little to do throughout. However, as a whole, there is less weight here than in A BEAUTIFUL MIND, and a little pigeon-holing in regards to the role of Max Baer -- seen mainly as a one-note baddie, again an old-trick of the hat to give the audience its Big Moment climactic villain (even when the real man was much different) -- but Crowe keeps on demonstrating just how powerful an actor he has become over the years of playing in American films."
"rainking_es","8","3","4","28 January 2006"," A nice movie about boxing...
","Ron Howard, the chronicler of the American Dream, the man who loves the happy endings with hurrays and violins strikes back with a new biopic (after ""A Beautiful Mind"", based on the life-story of John Nash), with a new story of long-suffering people who eventually get a well deserved reward. Well, who's the chosen one this time? It is Jim Braddock, a second rate boxer that won the Heavy Weights title in the years of the Great Depression. That way he became kind of a symbol for all the helpless people that were having a real bad time in those days.<br/><br/>""Cinderella man"" have such a nice setting and an awesome production, the ones only the big Hollywood studios can provide. The boxing sequences are rather realistic (this is not ""Rocky"", the fighters don't punch in the nose each other 200 times by round), and the recreation of sweaty and filthy boxing world is superb (it will satisfy even the more fussy). Anyway, there's not much to say about boxing, there are hundreds of movies which talk about that sport.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe plays Jim Braddock and he makes an awesome show of strength and charisma, he'll probably won the Oscar (that would be his second one, and his fifth nomination in 6 or 7 years). Renee Zelweeger plays the so loving and sympathetic wife of Braddock's. This woman looks like she's got rooted in Bridget Jones' character (please, no more pouting!!!), maybe with 30kg under. And last (but not least) we got Paul Giamatti, one of the actors of the moment. He plays Braddock's best friend and unselfish manager, and he plays it just brilliantly (he should win an Oscar as well).<br/><br/>In short: a new Ronnie Howard's hit, a good film that belongs to a genre which has been so mistreated there in Tinseltown. It is not as good as ""Raging Bull"" or ""Fat city"", but it's surely worth watching.... oh, and God bless America! <br/><br/>*My rate: 7.5/10"

Did things that no man will do to keep his family warm and did impossible performance that surprise everybody. Can say it's a miracle but it's his faith.

"bob the moo","Null","4","6","11 September 2008"," You've seen it before but it is still professionally effective
","Once a young, promising boxer injury and back luck has seen Jim Braddock turn in one poor fight after another to the point where he is stripped of his boxing license and forced to looked for other work to support his wife and young children. This career change comes just as the country enters an economic depression and, like the rest of the country Jim and his family struggle to get by. Eventually he is forced to swallow his pride and start collecting welfare to get by. An injury to another fighter ahead of a big night gives Jim one last payday as his agent manages to talk the commission into letting him back due as nobody else will do it at short notice. Jim takes the fight for the money but knows that a win could start him back again  but he has no idea how important this fight is for more than just him.<br/><br/>People on this site are praising this film and also wondering why it ""flopped"" (which is arguable but I'll let it stand) but to me it is perfectly understandable because the film is nothing wonderfully brilliant and is very much a package deal that perhaps people weren't in the mood for. I'm not sure if it is the presence of Crowe, Zellweger or what but here we are. What I mean by a ""package deal"" is that this is another one of those sports movies that follows the ""against all odds"" rise of the ""little fella"" when the rise takes on significant to the community/country. The obvious parallel is Seabiscuit and in a way Cinderella Man does the same thing in the same sort of way. So the sense of period is done really well through costumes and sets, the cast has big names, the big sporting events (in this case the fights) are done with a touch of slow-motion and, as the crowd rises, so does the music; whether you like it not, when they are done right they are very good at sweeping you up in the feelings.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man is no exception and it does it all with a professional polish and grand sweep. The details of the story are different but essentially it is the same film and unlikely to be considered ""great"" on its own terms  because it doesn't really have any. That said, it is another good film in this mould and by the end, when the music came up at the end, of course I was into it. Crowe does well to hold back his usual arrogance to be quite a polite figurehead for the film and makes it easy for you to get behind his character even if you don't like him as a person. Zellweger doesn't quite manage the same feat though, and her pained look and trademark whine was quite annoying to me and I didn't like her performance. Giamatti embraces the trainer cliché and makes it work for him while support from Considine, McGill and others help round out a starry cast. Howard directs with a sturdy hand, doing well with the fight scenes in particular; it isn't all down to him but I did think he let the sweeping meaning of the final fight get away with him a little bit but to be honest by then I was swept up in it myself.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man is nothing new or remarkable but it is still an easily enjoyable and warming sports movie in the mould of Seabiscuit and the like."

The storyline is absolute brilliant, and if I'll see it again some other time, I'd get an even better picture of this very, very touching and glorious film.

"FilmSnobby","2","11","24","8 June 2005"," Query to fans of this movie: Shall I tuck you in?
","*Cinderella Man* is the latest entry in what is apparently the newest American cinematic sub-genre: a heroic sports-figure (man or even horse) from the Depression Era, a ""little"" guy rising, against all odds, to become the champion of his (or its) given sport. It's sad, but not too terribly surprising, that movies like *Seabiscuit* and *Cinderella Man* are being made these days. When one considers the current political climate, in which, for example, our nation's leaders have apparently endorsed the torturing of our ""enemies"", infantilizing sap like this film must seem overwhelmingly attractive to both movie-makers and audiences. When a nation's pop culture is resorting to dewy-eyed, sepia-toned sentimentality for an era 70 years in the past, it not merely indicates an inability to look at our current dilemmas squarely in the face, but it also suggests a cowardly fear of what lies ahead. When great civilizations wax nostalgic for a presumably more ""innocent"" past, empires totter. How far we've fallen since *Rocky*! -- a film in which Sylvester Stallone made a country stand up and cheer immediately following the shell-shock from Vietnam and Watergate. Let it be noted that *Rocky* was set in contemporary times, too: Looking Forward, with Defiant Hope.<br/><br/>Not so, here. *Cinderella Man* says: Keep Looking Backward, Rube, and Cross Your Fingers! Setting aside the socio-political import of this movie, one has to wonder what sort of mood his countrymen is in that would make them not only want to watch this, but to even like it. Hell, you know the outcome going in! Braddock beats Baer! The End! Feel better now? Take two aspirins and call me in the morning, but first, let me tuck you in your safe, warm, cozy little beds. *Cinderella Man* is the cinematic equivalent of a young children's picture-book, like ""Goodnight Moon"", to be read before bed-time. The movie's fans, like sleepy four-year-olds snug in their beds, know exactly how each scene will play out and how the story ends. ""Read it again, Mommy."" Fine for the tykes; embarrassing, however, if you're an adult. How anyone can watch this film without a sense of crushing boredom is quite simply beyond my comprehension.<br/><br/>Are we surprised that the movie is directed by Ron Howard -- Mr. *Cocoon*? The usual Howardian sentimentality would be fine if there was anything indicative of an auteur's spirit to go with it. But no, we get every cliché in the book, in terms of both the screenplay itself and the very look of the picture (speckled with grit and leached of color during Braddock's hard-knock moments in his shanty home or at the docks; burnished with a happy sunshine-yellow when things start turning around; drenched with spit- sweat- and blood-spray across the frame during the over-edited boxing fights). There's some terrible dialog, too: at a press conference just before the climactic bout, Howard has Russell Crowe say that he's fighting for ""milk"". Oh Brother! Can you spare a dime? Did Braddock really say this? Probably not, considering the many errors and outright falsehoods, particularly about Max Baer, in this movie that historians have already documented.<br/><br/>I'm giving *Cinderella Man* a generous 2 stars out of 10 -- the second star entirely for some nice performances by Russell Crowe (earnest, soulful, really looking the part, and convincingly humble), and by Paul Giamatti as the trainer. NO marks, however, for Craig Bierko's camera-mugging, or for Renee Zellweger's constant sniffling."

I was hoping that those warning signals would be dispelled by the actual film. Let's just say that a train wreck wouldn't be an appropriate comparison to ""Cinderella Man""... at least there would be something real and moving in the disaster.<br/><br/>There are problems when: 1) The art direction overwhelms the story. 2) The leading actress has only expression throughout the film. 3) There are several shots of children while the big event is going on. 4) The camera spends more time away from the actual action in the ring. 5) One starts rooting for the ""evil"" contender. 6) Tributes to other films start popping all over the big dramatic scenes. For a while I thought I saw a shot of Robert DeNiro in color doing his ""Raging Bull"" close-up in a couple of the fights. 7) The pacing drags only to be broken by corny jokes... ""turtles"" anyone? 8) There is no suspense. 9) Transitions are at best muddled. 10) The film feels longer than the three extended versions of the LOTR put together.<br/><br/>Too bad...

Being a serious film about a real incident in a not too glamorous era, the movie arrives in the middle of the summer releases that seem to be made for action packed adventures or thrillers that don't require much of the viewer. That said, ""Cinderella Man"" presents a vivid portrait of one of the worst times in American history: The Great Depression.<br/><br/>At the center of the story is James Bradock, a fighter that is seen at the beginning of the film with what appears an assured future. Then, the bad times that affected the country have a profound effect in the Braddock family. From living with a certain degree of comfort, they are relegated to eke out a living in order to survive.<br/><br/>James Braddock's work in the New Jersey's piers becomes scarce, as only a few men are employed at a time. Early on, in a fight, Jimmy breaks a hand that puts him to a disadvantage among the men working at hauling cargo in and out of ships. Fortunately, Mike Wilson, a decent man, also impoverished by the situation, gives him a hand whenever they are teamed together. This will be a friendship that will last forever.<br/><br/>At home, things go from bad to worse. Mae Braddock, the wife and mother of three children, tries to make do with whatever little she can lay her hands in. It's heart wrenching to watch her try to put food on the table, let alone something that might have any nourishment. Jimmy Braddock has to resort to get public assistance and even to beg from the people that congregate at a Madison Square Garden club.<br/><br/>James Braddock's true friend turns out to be Joe Gould, who would guide him back to a phenomenal comeback that establishes him as one of the great fighters of the times. Jim Braddock goes to fight the powerful Max Baer, a man that has been notorious for killing a couple of opponents in the ring.<br/><br/>The film is satisfying in spite of all the desolation and poverty one sees. Of course, it's evident we either never went through those bad times of the 30s, or have never been in Mr. Braddock's family position. In spite of all that is against them, the family made out well and even went to prosper, which says a lot for them. Above all, Mr. Braddock teaches us a lesson in how to keep his family united in spite of the rough times they were facing.<br/><br/>As James Braddock, Russell Crowe makes a fabulous contribution. He transforms himself into the fighter that has to face poverty in order to appreciate what came afterward as a reward. Renee Zellwegger is fine as the suffering Mae. Paul Giamatti makes a tremendous appearance as Joe Gould. Paddy Considine plays Mike Wilson, the man who helped Braddock resume his work in the docks by carrying an extra weight when his friend was obviously in pain.<br/><br/>The screen play by Cliff Hollinger and Akiva Goldsman takes an intelligent account of the era. Finally, Ron Howard scores a real winner with this film, that should be seen by more people because it presents a real portrait of a man that was genuine and loved his family."
"jdesando","Null","5","9","29 May 2005"," An indomitable America coming back.
","""Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep . . ."" Hamlet <br/><br/>James J. Braddock lived in the Depression Era and fought for his family's life while defeating Max Baer for the heavyweight championship of the world in 1935. Ron Howard directs Russell Crowe in the titular role with an obvious affection for depicting the difficult financial times, the fighter, and the actor. Comparisons to Seabiscuit, both racehorse and film about him, are inevitable and flattering on all sides. Comparisons to ""Rocky"" go only as far as boxing and the rise and fall and rise again of thoroughly American heroes. Crowe is far superior to Stallone; Braddock is the real thing, Rocky is a fiction. The authentic boxer is more compelling by the nature of the reality Howard meticulously recreates.<br/><br/>I am always intrigued how a director can draw the audience into a drama when most already know the plot. But then Greek dramatists, and Shakespeare with his borrowed plots, have been doing that for centuries. Howard succeeds in making us care about this decent man with a gift, struggling in a time when the best were broken by the stock market crash of 1929. Much of the film chronicles Braddock's string of bad luck, most importantly a broken hand at the peak of his career, and the ambivalence of his wife, who would prefer he not fight anyone, much less the champ, who already killed two men in the ring.<br/><br/>In the struggle between husband and wife, I find strains of the Ron Howard missing auteur-ship because of his penchant for the sentimental. Too much time in this overly long biography is taken with the debate over whether or not Braddock should fight; we get the idea early on that no loving wife would want her husband to take a pounding that sometimes actually loosens the brain from the cranium. So Howard should get on with what he does extremely well, depicting the drama of the actual fights in the ring and in the offices of the commissioner, who once suspended Braddock's license for poor fighting and threatens to deny him the chance at world champion Max Baer.<br/><br/>That Braddock goes on to lose to Joe Louis is of little consequence for this film, just a footnote after the Baer fight. What is of real interest is that Ron Howard has grown as a filmmaker who can depict character and times in equal measure, Russell Crowe is an actor of enormous subtlety, and James Braddock was a true American hero, a fighter who came back, a symbol of an indomitable America coming back from economic failure."
"osloj","1","12","29","5 June 2006"," Ron Howard's ""opium inducing Hollywood""
","Ron Howard's apologia to the capitalists and greed merchants who bankrupted the economy of the world in the 1930's borders on sanctimonious state sanctioned propaganda, made by an inept puppeteer of emotions. Produced merely to make train loads of money and sold to meandering and lost U.S. audiences, who humbly crave a place in the world and a pain numbing drug (feel good cinema), ensnarled both by their love of sugar and savvy chic theater appeal, while their enthusiastic leaders wage war in foreign soils, this is the continued attempt of Hollywood to enter once again the politics of the ""I"".<br/><br/>Using the theme of ""courageous moral values"" (much like today's incompetent charismatic leaders), which time and time again is sequestered by those in power to move the humble masses into ideological behavior patterns, Howard crafts a narrow look into the life of a street bruiser, whose lack of foresight and intelligence, makes him both gullible and 'proud', a trait possessed by most of the lower class, to their detriment.<br/><br/>Absolutely devoid of any human interest or articulation, this film is pure rubbish, created by an ""opium inducing Hollywood"" to forget that ""times are hard"" and that by the lie which they force feed to the masses, ""sheer determination and hard work"", they'll all be better. Well, that is hardly reality, and neither is this film, it borders on liquid loads of sentimentality, showing starving families and kids who crave a better life, hungering for the ""American dream"" just around the block, which itself is a fictitious and disastrous lie. Instead of properly showing the man as he is, an exploited and misguided boxer without an IQ or class consciousness, subjugated day one from indoctrination in an industrial-capitalist world, a mere casualty of an oppressed class, Howard surges him to the role of a saint for the poor and downtrodden. He pays off his 'welfare' because he's so ashamed to be on it, he gives apples to blind kids and he kisses his wife at night, oh what loyalty to authority! Well, inject sugar into my veins, I can overcome my own poverty if I merely get into a ring to have my brains splattered by greedy ring promoters and homicidal boxers. This childish disposition to which Howard indulges us to drink, is nothing but empty and stale air. Howard makes Braddock into a wooden man, invulnerable at all to our own failings, and therefore, inhuman, without fault.<br/><br/>Cartoon-like episodes are neither vivid nor distinct, and by the end of this film, we feel like we have watched another worthless re-packaging of the same indeposable values that the U.S. seems to reap upon the unaware, blind, obedient masses. Instead of actually reading important books, a trait which is entirely forgotten by U.S. audiences, they want ""feel good portions"" heaped upon them.<br/><br/>This film drips with the adoration of petty values espoused by the elite classes while they themselves eat well and are mired in their own hypocrisy. Please, some audience members are not stupid, but most are, and they will praise this unworthy film, along with others, as the splendid creation of an artist touched by his evocation of the past which he has created."

Russel Crowe and Renee Zelweger fill the parts of Jimmy Braddock and his wife very well.

I am being generous with my grades here sicne I am making comparison between the movies I have watched since the year 2000 and this by the standards is a very out ranking movie. And those who refrain from watching this movie simply based on personal opinions of the cast member are making a big mistake by not watching this movie."
"hankhanks12345","9","4","7","3 July 2006"," Traditional film, but very well done
","""Cinderella Man"" is in many ways a very traditional film. We see Jim Braddock go from being comfortable, to very down on his luck, to triumphant. Braddock's wife has many scenes in which she implores him not to fight any more, but he keeps going despite that.<br/><br/>These might seem like clichés, and to a certain degree they are. But they're extremely well done clichés. The feel of the movie was something out of a different era, but I mean that in a good way.<br/><br/>One criticism of the film is that the character of Max Baer is not entirely accurate. In the movie they portray him as a swaggering, cocksure jerk who had no remorse of the fact that he had killed men in the ring. In reality, or at least according to his son, Max Baer, Jr. (who was an actor himself, and you can look up his credits on IMDb), Baer was in fact haunted by the deaths of his opponents, to the point of having nightmares and weeping over it at times. What's more, Baer, while playful in public and the ring, gave Braddock his due after the bout, and wasn't nearly as arrogant in public as they portrayed him. But I realize this is a Hollywood movie and not a documentary, so I don't really blame the film for making those changes.<br/><br/>I imagine Baer's story would have been as interesting a subject for a film as Braddock's. At one point is his career, for instance, Baer went up against Max Schmeling, a fighter Adolf Hitler held up as a kind of Aryan Fighting superman. Baer, whose father was half Jewish (although Baer himself was raised Catholic), decided to wear a Star of David during the bout. (He then continued to wear it for the rest of his career, including during the Braddock fight.) Afterward he appeared in about 20 movies, and his son had a successful career in front of and behind the camera in several TV series.<br/><br/>(To make things even more complicated, Schmeling privately had no use for Hitler's racial nonsense, and even risked his own life by hiding the sons of a Jewish friend in his hotel room during Kristallnacht.)"

"joshtheoscarking","10","5","10","29 May 2005"," An astounding, inspiring film from Russell Crowe!
","Chris Rock actually said it best during his opening monologue 3 1/2 months ago at the Kodak Theatre. ""If you're doing a movie about the past, you bet's to get Russell's ass."" <br/><br/>When I left the sneak preview screening on Sunday afternoon, my expectations were not just met, they where exceeded and then some. I'm ashamed now for doubting this film at all, and I did. The cast looked too perfect, the trailer too manufactured to win Oscars and a crew and tech team to die for. It looked too good to be true. Well, it IS that good. Cinderella MAN is hands down the best film I have seen in 4 years. And in the theatre today, I was not alone in that thought. The entire packed theatre could be seen to be sniffing and wiping away tears at multiple points in the film, cheering and clapping for Braddock all the way and on the absolute edge of their seat for the entire final fight. I knew how is was going to end, and I my heart felt like it was going to have an attack. The guy next to me was dodging the punches with Crowe. The film is that good.<br/><br/>The entire cast gives great performances all around and there are definitely noms heading towards Zellweger and Giamatti. Paul G., for that matter has a real shot at the win, and right now hes easily the front runner, helped by being snubbed for his turn as Miles last year in the wine-road-trip flick SIDEWAYS. Can the Academy give Best Supporting Actor to boxing trainers two years in a row? It is definitely possible. Especially if Giamatti can ride the wave of Cinderella MAN love which I guarantee will be rejuvenated by a timely December DVD release and maybe even a return to the theatres. But ultimately, like every film he's in, this picture is about Russell Crowe. What more can you say about an actor you goes from bad cop to gladiator, schizophrenic math genius to 19th-century ship captain, and then to a real-life boxer from 1930's New Jersey? What can you say? Possibly Oscar number two. Russell Crowe commands the film from start to finish and you can't help but notice that his marriage and new son have really loosened him up and actually probably helped him get into this role, a character you can't help but love and cheer for.<br/><br/>The sets, cinematography and costumes are all Oscar worthy and will most likely land nominations. And Thomas Newman has a nomination in the bag and a huge shot at the win hes been depraved of for like the last 10 years. Newman's win for Best Score is extremely probable even if Cinderella MAN fails to win Best Picture or anything else come this March. He'll probably receive the win as a consolation prize if CM doesn't land anything else a la FINDING NEVERLAND this year. And the lighting for the film is so rich and the best work I've seen since the first couple of seasons of The West Wing.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the film is that Craig Beirko's Max Baer, the ""villian"" of the flick who actually really did kill two men in the ring in the 1930's was at times, a little over-the-top in the ""I'm the bad guy"" department. The thing is, even with him hating Braddock a little too much, the rest of the film is so solid that we don't really care at all.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe's second Oscar (which he really should have won in 2001 for ABM) is not a given -- nor is Cinderella MAN winning Best Picture come March 3rd. There are a number of hurdles. For one, it has to keep buzz and be remembered in awards season. And two, it has to generate a respectable box-office. However, people who see this movie will not stay quiet. And Universal knows this. Why put out 739 sneak peaks on Sunday if you don't think people will talk about how awesome your film is? People are going to talk. And already it has flat-out raves from all the biggest trade papers -- Variety and The Hollywood Reporter -- as well has Ebert and Roeper giving it ""Two thumbs, way, WAY, up"". Buzz for this film is going to be huge and if the big applause at the end of my screening was any indication, this one could go all the way. It has the cast, it has the size, and it has a heart the size of Madison Square Gardens.<br/><br/>If Steven Spielberg's VENGEANCE or Rob Marshall's MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA aren't big hits, then this is your winner for 2005's Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>Cheers, Joshua Lawson"

","I just saw this movie and I'm pretty mixed. The acting was great: Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti are outstanding in their roles. Giamatti just about steals the whole movie, he is beyond great. Unfortunately, Zellweger's role was weakly-written and though she does an okay job, she doesn't come off nearly as well.<br/><br/>The movie, on the other hand, is really simple and sappy. At first, it seemed like Ron Howard was going to make a truly great movie. There's real restraint and elegance for a while. But then he goes for the big, broad, sappy choices and the whole thing turns to mush. One of my biggest problems was that the script doesn't develop a truly interesting conflict. The ideas are there, but they're not developed in an interesting way.<br/><br/>Overall, it feels trite, maudlin and overblown. Like most Ron Howard movies, it's a competently-made, softened-up version of better movies. There's definitely some suspense, and, yes, the fight scenes are compelling. But by the end, I wasn't very moved. I guess people will feel a big emotional payoff, but it didn't work on me (and I'm usually a big sap)."
"amadais","3","7","16","3 June 2005"," more about boxing than about people
","As it turned out. I had watched ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Raging Bull"", and ""Rocky"" (the first one), in the past 3 months. Each was approached with the same mindset: I hate sports, and nothings worse that sweaty, bloody guys hitting each other. But I was delightfully surprised with each. I found that they really weren't about boxing at all, but about the people and their lives, boxing was a side-note and the outcomes of the actual fights were irrelevant to the story. This one is different. This one is about boxing. It pretends not to be. It pretends to be about the working class uniting with a hope for the underdog. The fight scene in the end feels like it must be at least 30 minutes long. It feels like we see the ENTIRE fight. this is the climax of the movie, does he win or lose? who cares? I thought it was about standing up for something. no. it all comes down to a simple yes or no question. the movie feels very very contrived. the score sounds forced and artificial, the acting mostly functions on a surface level and the camera-work, don't even get me started on that. it's trying to have a STYLE with unstable cameras, and out of focus lenses. It's just distracting. I don't care much for the traditional classic shot framing style, it's boring. But Salvatore Totino's compositions make you feel unsettled when you shouldn't feel unsettled. It's quite distracting to have the person's face at the bottom of the screen, it doesn't matter if you are showing the entire head in the shot, you cut off the neck, and the face is at the bottom. It's very inconsistent as well. He switches between this off-kilter photography to a standard form, mid-scene. This wasn't healthy experimentation, it was the work of someone inexperienced. I kept joking that this must be his first time with a camera. But it turns out it really is only his fourth outing as cinematographer. This will probably win best picture next year, because it's trying so damn hard, and kissing the academy's ass. But it falls flat on it's face."

Almost all of the people on IMDb have not lived during the depression, we know that they were hard times, and Cinderella man got to take a glimpse at what it was like to live back then. It was so touching to see this family struggle but stick together. I can't imagine what Renee's character was going through every night not knowing if her husband was going to come back alive or not.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully acted and sublimely directed filmed movie with magnificent sets and a terrific and inspiring story.

"herbqedi","6","3","5","5 July 2006"," Overlong biopic with historical inaccuracies is redeemed somewhat by performances
","A lot of my problems with this movie has to do with me and the fact that I am part of a bygone generation.<br/><br/>I found this picture an ordeal to watch during most of its first 90 minutes. Yes, I understand that it takes place during the Great Depression. But, I didn't need Director Howard to actually immerse me in scene after scene of Depression-era bleakness to understand what that meant. I am also from the era where clever rapid-fire dialog gave a boxing movie its pace and rhythm. Today's movie-making seems to consider it a badge of honor to use as little dialog and as many visuals with music as possible. If this was a boxing movie from that era, it would have run 105 minutes at most, not 144 minutes. I also found Crowe's mumbling very hard to understand (probably time that I got an ear trumpet).<br/><br/>Finally, the portrayal of Max Baer by Craig Bielko seemed unlike the Baer I've seen interviewed and in movies. The ""Jewish Bomber"" as he was known (and at his comedic best in Africa Screams with A & C) was generally witty and fairly soft-spoken for a boxer. I knew of one lethal incident (need to check on the other) but he was very humble about that, not bragging. And, he was not known as the talker and showman in the ring as depicted. Unless someone has other info, I believe that this was all the invention of this movie.<br/><br/>All this said, in the scenes in which he is audible, Crowe is magnificent, and Giamatti is even better. Zellweger -- one of the top actresses of her generation in my opinion -- has a rather thankless character and makes her as human as possible. Bruce McGill and others as already noted also provide excellent support. And, I simply loved Rance Howard, Ron's father, as a cynical announcer. In the end, the triumph of James J. Braddock is well-told once the story threads win out in importance over the Depression-era atmosphere."
"lee_eisenberg","9","3","5","25 December 2005"," Why did such a great movie flop?!
","Having seen most of Ron Howard's movies, I know that he's a director who has a tendency to try and tug at people's emotions. Maybe after playing Opie Taylor and Richie Cunningham, he wanted to show people that he could be more than ""silly""; thus, ""Cocoon"" showed hope for senior citizens, ""Backdraft"" showed the lives of firefighters, ""The Paper"" looked at journalism, and ""Apollo 13"" focused on a real event. As it is, I have liked most of his movies, and I can now add ""Cinderella Man"" to that list.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays Jim Braddock, a working stiff who was a boxing star back in the '20s. But when the Depression hit, he and his family were plunged into abject poverty. With no other options open, Jim convinces his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) to find him a boxing match. When Jim wins, it begins his path to prominence again, and hope for his family.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" struck me less in its focus on boxing than in its look at the Depression. Jim's only chance for work is to go to the harbor where the boss only admits five people each day, and Jim's busted hand makes it hard for him to work even when he gets in. Also, much of the movie shows Jim walking through the slums, and another scene shows a bunch of rich people in a fancy hotel as a contrast to how most people were living. As for the boxing aspect, many movies have shown working class people trying to make something of themselves by getting into boxing, so maybe that's why the boxing aspect didn't strike me as much.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very well-done piece of cinema. Crowe and Giamatti are perfect in their roles, as is Renee Zellweger as Jim's desperate but strong wife Mae. Also starring are Craig Bierko as Jim's opponent Max Baer (yes, Jethro Bodine's father), and Paddy Considine as Jim's friend Mike, whose desperation leads him to commit suicide. Howard and Crowe have accomplished something as great as they did with ""A Beautiful Mind"". I can't understand why this movie flopped, even if there was an overall low turnout this summer."

","A movie about James Braddock? Why not? He seemed like a good man, the salt of the earth, who overcomes all kinds of adversity to become the heavyweight champion. Not a bad story at all ... but so what? But if Hollywood is going to make a movie about boxing champions, how about making a movie about the life and career of Benny Leonard, arguably the greatest lightweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Carlos Monzon, arguably the greatest middleweight champion in the history of boxing? Or what about a movie about the life and career of Barney Ross, who was world champion in three different weight classes and war hero? In fact, what about a movie about the life and times of Max Baer, who is portrayed as the ""bad guy"" in the movie, and who, by the way, wore the Star of David on his trunks, so how bad could he be? In fact, if Baer was such a bad guy, how could he have been the father of Max Baer, Jr. who played Jethro Bodine on ""The Beverly Hillbillies""? Any man who was the father of the actor who played Jethro Bodine could not have been all that bad of a guy. Max Baer was a boxer, boxing is a violent sport and naturally, and unfortunately, the contestants do get hurt or worse. But to imply that Max Baer was gratuitously violent is unfair, even for a movie. So, if you want to watch a movie about James Braddock, then this is probably the movie to watch, but don't come away thinking badly about Max Baer. Remember, if it wasn't for Max Baer, there may never have been a Jethro Bodine."
"wamba7","6","3","5","14 June 2005"," Well worn but worthwhile
","Dang, that Russell Crowe sure can take a licking and keep on ticking. I would have liked Cinderella Man a whole lot more if I hadn't already seen it at least a half dozen times, most recently in a Turner Classic screening of ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"", with Paul Newman and Pier Angeli in the Crowe-Zellweger roles. ""Somebody"" inspired the Rocky series in the 70s after which karate had to be given its due, and most recently we saw Clint Eastwood's melancholy take on the gentle art. <br/><br/>None of this is meant to take anything away from the acting or direction of this well-crafted but well-traveled story, which adds a new dimension by setting the action during the Depression. The character of James Braddock is given the burnished treatment of a mythical boxing hero: a ferocious animal in the ring, but a good-natured, loving man outside. Crowe renders this trope with his typically understated grace and intelligence, and the script gives him a lot to work with - as a former contender making a comeback during the 1930s, he has history on his side when tells a reporter the reason he fights is ""for milk"" for his family. <br/><br/>Renee Zellweger seems so comfortable in the role of supportive mate that it required a look at her resume for me to realize that she has not played a similar part since she cut her teeth on the part of long-suffering Dorothy in Jerry Maguire. I look forward to seeing how she plays Janis in ""Piece Of My Heart"", which started production this year, according to IMDb.com.<br/><br/>Although critics have raved about Paul Giamatti, who plays Braddock's manager, for the last 2 years, I haven't taken the bait. He may have been nominated for an Oscar for ""Sideways"", but that film would have been nothing without his three strong supporting actors. Although he tries, it's hard for us to picture the pasty, cerebral actor as a fight manager - even when he talks the talk, he almost sounds like he's explaining his approach to the role in front of Jim Lipton and an audience of hungry thespians. Placing Giamatti next to the legendary Angelo Dundee outside the ring might have sounded good, but it backfires.<br/><br/>Apparently Max (""Jethro"") Baer, Jr., has taken Ron Howard to task for the movie's rendition of his father, the formidable heavyweight champion. Although Baer, Sr. did play a part in ending the lives of two of his opponents - one expired in the ring after a devastating blow to the head - the champ was said to have been tormented by guilt afterward. Even Jim Braddock, the model for Crowe's character, said that Baer was a genuinely good fellow who merely played the part of a villain to promote the sport of boxing. Apparently Howard found that to be an indispensable part for his movie, which graphically compares the horrors of the ring to the horrors of ""Hoovervilles"" in the 30s - as Braddock says in an argument with a leftist friend, ""you can't fight shadows,"" i.e., poverty and greed. Max Baer, whatever else he might have been, was definitely not a shadow, and the prospect of facing his lethal right hand causes Braddock some visible hesitation even after a string of upset victories. <br/><br/>On one level, the movie is a commentary on human nature similar to ""Seabiscuit"": in difficult times we need heroes, two legged, four legged, or wherever we can get them. The title comes from a sportswriter's column referring to Braddock's return from obscurity and destitution. <br/><br/>On another level, it is the story of one man's redemption. Jim Braddock may have had a gift that most men admire exactly because they lack it, but he too was faced with the breadline and might have lost his family and even his life except for a freakish bit of luck. Ron Howard and his lead actor never let us forget how close even a man of Braddock's apparently outstanding character and ability came to falling. It's a testament to this movie's quality that it conveys this theme so consistently while avoiding overstatement."
"schappe1","8","3","5","13 June 2005"," One False Note
","Ron Howard's homage to boxer James J. Braddock is a good movie, well made with fine performances and its heart definitely in the right place. Some might criticize it for being full of Rocky-like clichés but this was a real-life Rocky and the story is told in an economical fashion that avoids the cartoonish nature of the Rocky series and thus becomes more moving- with one exception.<br/><br/>I'd read some boxing history in the past and I wondered if Max Baer, the fighter Braddock beats for the title, was really the nasty guy he's pictured as here. ""The Encyclopedia of World Boxing Champions"" by Jack McCallum, describes Baer in this manner: ""Max was a man difficult to dislike. He possessed a lusty sense of humor, irresistible good nature and tremendous warmth for people. He chattered and charmed his way into the hearts of just about everybody."" Somehow I didn't get that impression when Russell Crowe, as Braddock, asks Craig Bierko, as Max, to stop making comments about how he is going to kill Braddock in the ring because it was upsetting his family and Baer responds by saying, ""Don't worry, I'll be there to comfort your widow."" The final fight also seems to be misrepresented. McCallum reports ""The Braddock fight was a dull, routine affair, a painful spectacle of an over-confident, silly kid losing to an aged, methodical club fighter."" Baer himself is quoted as saying ""I clowned away the title in 15 rounds."" What we see in the movie is an exciting Pier 6 brawl with the fighters getting angry at each other, pummeling each other, the tide constantly turning. Exciting stuff but not the way it really happened.<br/><br/>Of course Baer was a dangerous man in the ring. He possessed perhaps the best right hand punch ever and Frankie Campbell and Ernie Schaaf lost their lives absorbing it, as the film points out, (although I don't understand the motivation for the selfish promoter to endlessly point this out to Braddock who has become his meal ticket with the ""Cinderella Man"" story). But those tragedies are more of a comment on boxing than on Baer. The real difference between Baer and Braddock seems not to have been their regard for their fellow human beings but rather their attitude toward their profession and that difference is what won the fight.<br/><br/>I think what happened here is that Ron Howard and the writer decided the audience would respond more to a ""Clubber Lang"" type ""bad guy"" than a clown who threw away his crown and to a ""Hollywood"" title fight rather than the semi-farcical event the real thing was."

","I saw this movie last night in San Diego. About 12 people in the theater for the Opening week-end Saturday:7pm showing. Where were all the people?<br/><br/>What a great director Ron Howard is, he should be listed as one of greats. He has the same talent as Frank Capra. This film is about a Great Hero of the Great Depression, a prize fighter, husband and father, we all can learn from today. Talk about family values!! The thing I like about a Ron Howard film I know I'm going to see something great he never fails me. All three leads must have an Academy Award for this. Russel Crowe is so subtle and sweet in his portrayal of James Braddock we truly see what a great man Braddock was. He paid back the Welfare money with money he earned from fighting. (Who pays back welfare today?)The best scene for me was when Braddock's son steals food for the family to eat. Braddock and the boy take the meat back to the butcher, confess the sin then the father shows love and understanding to the boy. I wish all dads could be like that. Another scene when their father is in the fight of his life Max Baer ,the heavy weight championship they hide in the basement and listen to the radio. The look on their faces when they are found is pricless this is a sign of the ""Howard touch""it will rip your heart out. Good job by everyone, the editing was the making of the fight scencs bravo."

It is really an extraordinary story about one simple man who only had his two fists in life and who became the fearless hero of a hole generation of people who were fighting to survive during the great depression. This film was greatly directed. Is like assisting to the best boxing match in history. It touches you deeply in the heart to see how courageously this man had to fight and how incredible this man went from being a poor suffering ordinary man to a great champion.

","Two years ago, during the summer of 2003, I was working at a movie theater in my home town. ""Seabiscuit"" was playing and this particular showing was on a run-of-the-mill Wednesday night. As the show was breaking, I opened the door to the house and saw the ending and the audience applauding. The result was the same when I saw the film a week prior on a Sunday afternoon. The new film, ""Cinderella Man,"" had the same effect on the audience the night I saw it. The movie is so inspiring and uplifting in the classic sense of Hollywood splendor, that one finds themselves moved to tears and cheering on the hero of the show. What makes this unique is the fact that this audience is in a movie theater. What we see on the screen is not live. Yet we feel transformed to Madison Square Garden during that amazing night in June of 1935 when James J. Braddock took on Max Baer for the Championship of the World. It is as close to the real thing as we can get these daysand what an experience it is at that. It is what makes going to the movies so magical. <br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" tells the story of once great boxer Jim Braddock played masterfully by Russell Crowe. Early on in his career, Braddock made lots of dough and was adored by family and fans. But after the stock market crash and during the Great Depression, his career goes down the tubes and his abilities dwindle as a fighter. He struggles to find work at the pier and to keep his family fed. It leads to desperate measures on the part of his son to stealing salami from a butcher, his wife sending their children to relatives because they cannot afford to take care of them, to Braddock having to beg for cash. After a time, Braddock's old manager Joe (Paul Giamatti) comes to him with an opportunity by chance to make some quick cash in the ring. Since<br/><br/>Braddock realizes the hardships he has faced, he takes the opportunity for exactly what it isan opportunity. To him, it is more than just a fight or something he loves; it is a chance to see Madison Square Garden again, a chance to hear the roar of the crowd. And a chance to show his children that he still has what it takes to be a champ. Braddock wins the fight and amazes the audience who barely remembered his existence. He generates a comeback and starts to win fights regardless of his age or condition. This is because his reasons for boxing have changed, ""This time around I know what I'm fightin' formilk!"" He has a family and needs to support them. However, the chances become far more dangerous when Braddock is asked to fight against Max Bear, a boxer who killed two men in the ring with his power punches to the head. Regardless of the danger, Braddock agrees to go ahead with the fight, even against his wife's urges to get out of it. It all leads to a stirring finally that will leave the audience breathless and emotional.<br/><br/>One of the film's most touching moments comes when Braddock realizes that his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) has sent their children away to relatives because they can no longer afford to take care of them. He is deeply upset because he has made a promise to his son that no matter how bad things would get, he would never send the children away. As a desperate measure, he goes to see his old bosses and asks for any money they can spare. He holds out his hat and most drop some coins or a few dollars in. We see Crowe's face at this point, his eyes welling up. You feel his humility and how pathetic his existence has become by begging for money. And yet, he is not a beggar. He simply has nothing left and it is easy to sympathize with him. <br/><br/>There are excellent uses of cinematography in this picture. As the film opens, the camera shots are steady as we see Braddock as a winner in his early days, living in a nice home in New Jersey with plen ty of worldly possessions. Then, as we see Braddock and his family living in a slum apartment, the camera shots become shaky and convey the lack of stability in his life. Some great moments of editing occur during scenes where Braddock gets injured. There is a slow motion shot of the blow to the body. Then the screen goes white momentarily with an ex-ray shot of Braddock,conveying the severity of the pain. <br/><br/>What truly makes ""Cinderella Man"" go beyond the predictable aspect of an uplifting story is Braddock's merit for his comeback. He is no longer fighting with his passion for the sport or to gain a higher place in society. He fights so his children can eat and be brought up in a home with heat. What began as a man motivated by passion brought down by ability and circumstance, becomes a man motivated by the ability to exist and provide for his family. That, in and of itself, is the true greatness of this film. (***1/2 out of ****)"

We stayed intact because of men like Braddock and the true marvel of this film is that one is able to personally feel every emotion displayed on the screen.

It showed everything incorporated in boxing. Most of all the drive. Russle Crowe was absolutely amazing. One of the best I have ever seen, by far. This movie was not just a boxing movie....I laughed....I cried. I did everything you should in a good movie in general. But, when you include boxing in that list it makes it more than just a movie....it was enchanting. There are just not enough words to describe the emotion felt scene after scene.

","Director Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" was not what I was expecting. It is a touching love story, and a story of great character. It is the best movie of the year so far. Yes, is not just a movie about boxing. It is Ron Howard's best movie-- so moving and inspiring. Russell Crowe as Depression Era Heavyweight contender, James J. Braddock, is so powerful, compassionate, and inspiring. Though sometimes it takes a little to reconcile, Crowe's screen persona from his media celebrity, I think Crowe truly distinguishes himself as the movies' most powerful actor with almost limitless range. He is awesome in ""Cinderella Man"", and he may win another Oscar.<br/><br/>I was familiar with Jim Braddock in the context of Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (played in the movie by Craig Bierko). Jim Braddock would become Heavyweight Champion by upsetting the arrogant Max Baer. I had read accounts for the accuracy in ""Cinderella Man"" depicting Baer as a smug, arrogant, partier. Baer even took pride in the fact that he killed 2 boxers in the ring. As excellently played by Bierko, Baer is basically a big bully, who thinks he can have his way, because he is stronger than everyone. But ultimately he is short on heart, and void of any character.<br/><br/>Jim Braddock (Crowe) went down a different path, the fate of the Great Depression, and thus, his transformation was entirely distinct. In 1925 Jim was a number one Light Heavyweight contender managed by Joe Gould (the amazing Paul Giamatti). Jim had a lovely home with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger), and their 3 children: Jay (Connor Price), Howard (Patrick Louis), and Rosie (scene stealer Ariel Waller). Jim and Mae were so in love, and it is clear from the beginning that their relationship is a source of strength and courage. During the Depression the Braddocks are reduced to poverty, living in a run down apartment. Jim works at the docks, and takes fights for chump change. A series of events causes Jim to leave boxing, and the proud Jim vows to keep his family together. This is where the screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsmith (based on the story by Hollingsworth) transcends to a moving tale of love and family. There is a heart-wrenching scene where Jim (Crowe) asks for money from his former promoters so he can pay for the electricity for his family, saying to Joe Gould, ""I'm sorry..."" Through luck and accident Jim gets another shot back in boxing due to Joe. This time it is different. Jim eventually gets a shot at the World Title held by Max Baer. Even one the fighters Jim beats this time around says, ""He's not the same guy."" During a press conference prior to the Title Fight, when asked what was different this time around, Jim says he fights for ""milk""-- recalling a scene with his daughter Rosie. Ron Howard along with his writers Hollingsworth and Goldsmith are such compelling and moving storytellers. An amazingly strong and understated Renee Zellweger as Mae is terrified for her husband Jim who is fighting a giant who may literally kill her husband before the fight tells Jim, ""You are the champion of my heart."" That stopped me in my tracks. ""Cinderella Man"" is all heart, and is a movie that truly inspires us all. It is an amazing movie about character and ultimately the inherent greatness in us all.<br/><br/>This is Russell Crowe's best performance to date. His power is tempered with great compassion and such a delicate tenderness. Renee Zellweger is a rock. Her performance is dead on for authenticity, and her understated strength is a joy to watch. Paul Giamatti is such a talented actor. He brings a lightness and humanity to ""Cinderella Man"". Director Howard direction is so natural and the performances of his actors are truly awesome. ""Cinderella Man"" may be the best movie of the year. It is a great movie about greatness. Now this is something we can all celebrate."

","Cinderella Man was extremely powerful. I felt every emotion from excitement, to fear, to deep sadness, to joy. Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have done it again! They make us feel what ordinary movies cannot- pure love and passion. By the end of this film i was in tears, and i was clutching my boyfriend's arm like no tomorrow. I work in a movie theater, so i've seen many movies, actually i've seen almost every movie that has come out in the last few years. Cinderella Man is better than them all. If it doesn't win best picture at the Academy Awards this year, I will be very disappointed. It should win best picture of the decade (so far). If you see this movie, you will not walk away unmoved. Also, the cinematography and direction are brilliant. Russell Crowe is the best actor of my time, and Giamotti is excellent as wee."
"dishmanl","3","5","11","11 June 2005"," Is this your kind of film? Go see it. Otherwise.......
","People apparently need people on pedestals. The film indicates that depression era people considered James Braddock a hero, an underdog who gave them hope. That's nice. I have no use for sports heroes and I convey unto them no supernatural expectations. I have no use for Depression era movies or stories. Boxing to me is a modern day version barbarism. I do, however, insist that I can overlook all those caveats if the resultant film warrants. ""Cinderella Man"" fails. Russell Crowe can play a rugged well-meaning person and Renee Zellweger is a sufficiently capable actress. Still, there is a dullness and shallowness to their characters. The lives of real people can fail to be cinematic  perhaps that's the problem: if so, why make the movie at all? Oh, I forgot: people need heroes. Director Ron Howard has all the subtlety of a ballerina in cement overshoes and this film continues that tradition. Unobtrusive camera work is a foreign concept to the man. Brief street scenes suffer equally with the fight scenes. Music? Even Thomas Newton's soundtrack fails: ""listen to his ""Road to Perdition"" instead. As the credits rolled, I considered: my companion enjoyed the film (she is a dedicated Russell Crowe-phile) and the Diet Pepsi was cold and bubbly. It was ultimately the film that lacked fizz."

","(Some Spoilers) Increidable but true depression era rags to riches ""Cinderella Story"" about the amazing comeback of boxer James ""The Bergen New Jersey Bulldog"" Braddock, Russell Crowe, who went from having to go on welfare, which he later honestly paid back, to be able to care for his family to become the Heavyweight Champion of the World. All this within the space of less then two short but unforgettable years. <br/><br/>A major prospect for becoming the Light-Heavyweight Champion of the world back in the late 1920's Braddock was soundly beaten on July 18, 1929 in a match with the fast fisted and fleet footed light heavyweight Tommy Loughran. Three months after the Loughran bout the Stock Market crashed and Jimmy, like tens of millions of fellow Americans, faced a bleak future with the high-living and fast-spending years of the 1920's becoming a distant memory with the Great Depresion descending upon America. <br/><br/>We see Jimmy four years later in 1933 at the end of the line as a professional boxer in his dull and boring match with Abe Feldman ,which ended after six rounds as a no contest. In his dressing room Jimmy is found to have broken his right hand and the New York State Boxing Commission has his boxing license revoked. The winter of 1933/34 was a cold and bitter one for the Braddock's with the heat turned off, because Jimmy was unable to pay the utilities, and with the Baddock's children being sent away, for a short time, to family members in Brooklyn because him and his wife Mae, Renee Zellweger, couldn't care for them. This really hurt Jimmy since he swore to his young son Jay never to give him or his brother and sister Howard & Rosey away to relatives no matter what happened. <br/><br/>By the late spring of 1934 Jimmy was at the end of his rope with little or no work on the Jersey docks, because of his broken right hand, and no chance to get back in the ring. It's then just like in the movies, mind you this is a true story, a miracle happened to Jimmy which also reflected, and uplifted, his friends and family and everyone else in America who had their hopes and dreams dashed to pieces by the Great Depression. It's was then that Jimmy's former manager Joe Gould, Paul Glamatti, got him a match, as well as his license back to box with his right hand having mended,on the under-card of the Heavyweight Championship fight between the champ Primo Carnera, Matthew G. Taylor, and the very dangerous challenger Max Baer, Craig Blerko. <br/><br/>Jimmy was picked by boxing promoter James Johnston, Bruce McGill,as a sacrificial lamb to be knocked out by the highly touted Corn Griffin, Art Binkowski. In the fight the desperate and brave Jimmy Barddock, after taking everything that Griffin threw at him,floored Griffin in the third round to the astonishment of everyone watching! With his boxing career now back on track Jimmy went on to beat John Henry Lewis, who beat Jimmy in a ten round decision in San Fanciso two years earlier, on Nevember 16, 1934. Jimmy then went on to defeat the very powerful and hard hitting Art Lasky on March 22, 1935 with is fancy footwork and superior boxing abilities.This set the scene up for the Heavyweight Championship bout between Jimmy and Max Baer in the Long Island Bowl on June 13, 1935. Exactly a year after he began his comeback by knocking out Corn Griffin in the same arena, Madison Square Garden, that Max Baer won the coveted title. <br/><br/>Jimmy, given no chance at all by the experts to defeat the ""Big Bad Baer"", In one of the most exciting and heart lifting boxing sequences ever put in a movie, as well as happening in real life, took the fight to Baer right from the opening bell. Freely mixing it with the champ Jimmy took everything that the ""Killer"" Max Baer could hit him with and gave back as good as he got in return. Clowning around at first Baer got serious later opening up on Jimmy with all the heavy artillery he had in his boxing gloves.<br/><br/>With tremendous courage, and ring savvy and boxing finesse, Jimmy fending off Baer's wild and desperate assaults in the late rounds was still holding on to a slim, but diminishing, lead as the bout went the full distance going into the 15th round. <br/><br/>In the fateful last round with him ahead on all cards Jimmy instead of trying to avoid Baer's punches, and run out the clock in order to win the Heavyweight Championship, mixed it up and stood toe to toe with the champ in the most exciting round of the entire fight. In the end Jimmy walked away with the title in a unanimous decision that left the crowd, at first quite and sullen, at the Long Island Bowl in complete pandemonium. <br/><br/>Jimmy Braddock's amazing victory gave the American people something to cheer about during those dark and bleak depression years. Jimmy Bradock was an underdog in every sense of the word yet overcame all the obstacles that were placed in front of him. In the end Jimmy showed that no matter how bad things are faith and belief in oneself is the most powerful force that one can have. And with that faith one can not only succeed over unbelievable odds but inspire others to do the same as well. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in the movie ""Cinderella Man"" came just before the fight between Jimmy Braddock and Max Baer as Jimmy's wife Mae went into her church to light a candle and say a prayer for her courageous and valiant husband. To Mae's astonishment she saw that almost the entire town of North Bergen New Jersey were in the church doing the exact same thing!"

","Cinderella Man (2005) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Russell Crowe gives the performance of his career as James Braddock, a boxer who loses it all during the Great Depression only to get one more chance inside the ring. While watching the film I couldn't believe Crowe didn't get an Oscar nomination but then it reminded me of everyone who did this year. Which, in return, got me thinking how weak roles are for women. Every year there's always one woman who can walk away with the prize but when it comes time to the men you've got five people who didn't get nominated that could have won. Anyway, this is certainly the best film of director Ron Howard's career since we've seen this story so many times before yet he keeps it fresh and interesting down to the final fight. The scene where Crowe has to beg for money from the boxing commission is the best work he's ever done and heartbreaking work from Crowe. Paul Giamatti is very good in his role and Renee Zellweger is good as well even though her role really isn't written very well."
"redfearnb","9","2","3","14 March 2006"," The emotion is overwhelmingly real, based on a true family story. Awesome!
","What an amazing movie. A drama full of every imaginable emotion. Boxing is quite an interesting sport. I've never really enjoyed its brutality, but I have to admire the boxers for their fitness and determination. I suppose it takes a different kind of man than myself to be a boxer. Cinderella Man contains all of the clichéd aspects of a classic boxing movie. The family is struggling to survive while the wife never approves of what her husband is doing, the underdog rises again to reclaim his glory, and the suspenseful fights keep you guessing who will win. The difference, however, is that this movie is based on a real man who experienced all of these things first hand. The delicate feelings and subtle changes of everyday life make the movie very real. I enjoyed the music the most in this movie. Crowe has always been a favorite actor of mine and while I don't like Zellweger, she played a good role nonetheless. I'll admit that I was pretty choked up throughout the movie and it wasn't just because I'm sick. The last thing that I really have to mention is the occasional, but not too frequent, use of the first-person camera angle. When it is used, its very, very impactive. Once again, it is an awesome movie and everyone should see it."

WELL DONE!!! What is wrong with Hollywood when they ignore this one? Maybe two years in a row for fight movies was too much. I did like last year's but a fem ale fight movie is not representative of the sports as a whole. The historical angle was also thoroughly researched. I have often heard and seen and read many stories about the Depression but I have never felt the impact and reality of the societal loss as I did in this film. So many aspects of excellence and still ignored. In a way I can understand because it was an emotionally grueling movie and not just entertainment....but the fight scenes were great!

This is a fantastic movie, a biographical look at a man from a time that seems so tragic and depressing (it was the great depression, after all) but still makes you feel good and warm about all that was right with people back then. When going on welfare was worse than starving to death, when getting your face smashed in just so your kids could eat for another week wasn't much of a sacrifice, when a true underdog could do the impossible........if this movie doesn't make you feel something, you are probably already dead.<br/><br/>Rent it or buy it, it appeals to all demographics. Plenty of action for those Rocky fans, plenty of style for the Godfather crowd. Without a doubt, one of the best movies I've seen in years."

This movie was more about a husband and father doing what he knew had to be done for his family. It showed one mans integrity, strength and inner struggles and how in the face of things none of us alive today can truly appreciate, a person is able to focus on the only truly important thing in life: family. Don't be fooled; this movie is not about boxing. This movie is about love, decency, integrity and remembering what's important in this life."
"jackjack-2","10","2","3","6 February 2006"," Best Movie of 2005
","The best picture of 2005 and Russell Crowe should be the Best Actor. This story of former heavyweight champion Jim Braddock is superbly told with remarkable accuracy but it also is a history lesson. Most viewers don't have a clue as to how bad it was during the Great Depression but this movie will give them a clue. It would have been better except that a very revealing scene wound up on the cutting room floor during the director's cuts.<br/><br/>In that scene, Braddock joins his family who are standing in a soup line. The significance of the scene is not that they are in a soup line but that Braddock has his boxing shoes hanging around his neck. After Braddock goes through the soup line, he then goes to his old gym to sell the shoes. He tries to get a dollar for them but he is so desperate he ends up selling them for a quarter. But the scene is also significant for another reason and should have been left in the movie.<br/><br/>When he sells his shoes, his manager is lurking in the background and sees the sale and he knows Braddock is giving up fighting. Later, the manager is able to get Braddock a fight and when Braddock, who needs the money desperately, agrees, the manager gives him a pair of shoes. Because the earlier scene was cut, viewers are left guessing as to how the manager knew that Braddock needed the shoes.<br/><br/>Another directors cut presents the same dilemma. Early in the movie, Braddock breaks his hand during a fight and the fight winds up a draw and he does not get paid. He is flat broke. Yet when he gets home his hand is in a cast and the cast is significant in the movie. The viewer has to wonder how did Braddock pay for the cast when he is so broke? What was cut was a scene in which after the fight, we see Braddock's manager prepare a splint and bandage up the hand for a cast. That scene should have been left in the movie.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard made few mistakes and these were two . But he was smart enough to get former heavyweight boxing manager Angelo Dundee not only as an adviser but a role in the movie. It improved the realism immensely. And if the viewer has watched the actual films of Braddock's championship fight, the viewer can see how realistically the fight was duplicated in the movie. For a rank amateur Crowe did a superb job of boxing.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Renée Zellweger. I usually can't stand her but she was perfectly cast as Braddock's wife and she plays the part exceptionally well.<br/><br/>One omission in the film. Max Baer, the heavyweight champion Braddock defeated, always wore a big Star of David on the left leg of his boxing trunks. Baer did this to show support of the Jews who were being badly persecuted in Nazi Germany at the time. It wasn't seen in the movie. The movie makes Baer out to be a very obnoxious person and possibly Howard was concerned that it would be considered anti-Semitic to make Baer look like a loud mouthed Jew.<br/><br/>In a way this movie is nostalgic in that I grew up during the Great Depression. However, I was too young to have heard the Baer-Braddock fight. Besides like many at that time, we didn't have electricity so we didn't have a radio. Moreover, Jim Braddock was kind of an in betweener among heavyweight boxers. In between Jack Dempsey, Gene Tunney and Joe Louis. Champions such as Primo Carnera, the Argentine Bull, and German Max Schmelling were more famous and Braddock was a forgotten man until Ron Howard and Russell Crowe resurrected him in Cinderella Man."
"ignatiusloyala","7","2","3","10 January 2006"," Good but...
","I just watched Cinderella Man on DVD. It's a good movie: good story, good acting, good action, good setting, but still not quite there. The story is very well told. However, it's also quite clichéd. From the point when the Braddock family sank deep in the Depression, everything sounds too familiar. The rest of the film is the classical mix of melodrama: sickness, unhappiness, apprehension, quarrel... I don't have to wait till Renee opens her mouth to know what she's gonna say and how Crowe will reply. Also, too many films have already used boxing as their subject, which may I add is painfully short of variations. When there was Million Dollar Baby already last year, Cinderella Man doesn't seem fresh.<br/><br/>It's a very well done movie. Yet it's built on a rather weak foundation that it simply can't make it up to the top tier however many buckets of tears it can win from the audience. Just as the Golden Globe has reflected, acting is its only big trump card."
"moniker_jones","8","2","3","6 November 2005"," Decent Flick, Unfortunate Title
","Every year there are a handful of films released which seem destined for great things. This is no accident. Some movies seem to exist more for the Oscar potential of their stories than the stories themselves. Cinderella Man is 2005's first example of this familiar trend. It's the uplifting tale of one underdog boxer's triumph over adversity. Rocky spun a similar yarn nearly 30 years ago and took home the highly coveted Best Picture award. The same can be said for last year's outstanding Million Dollar Baby. Cinderella Man is not quite as good as those two films, but it does possess one unique benefit: it's a true story.<br/><br/>Anyone who saw 2003's Seabiscuit has pretty much seen Cinderella Man. Simply replace the horse and its rider with Russell Crowe's rugged, determined boxer, James Braddock. Spurred on by the need to save his family from the terrors of the Great Depression, Braddock took his one last chance at pugilistic greatness and ran with it. Crowe does a typically admirable job of filling Braddock's gloves. Director Ron Howard essentially repeats his increasingly obvious formula: take a made-for-TV story and give it the high gloss treatment. It worked perfectly for his A Beautiful Mind, which undeservedly took home the top Oscar several years ago. Rounding out the cast are the delightful Paul Giamatti and one of Hollywood's most overrated enigmas, Renee Zellweger. This entertaining movie has a lot of heart, but falls just short of a knockout. <br/><br/>Rating: B+"

","Excellent movie! So good I felt I had to write and let people know. Initially, thought a movie about boxing would bore me to death. Got 5 mins into the story, and was in floods of tears throughout the whole movie. Is ideal for both women and men - women have the family, sensitive side to enjoy, men - the boxing action. It was also fascinating to see what actually went on during the Great Depression! Makes you value what you have now. Amazing to see what went on in Central Park, NY City.<br/><br/>Will be watching again this evening to enjoy yet again the fantastic acting skills of Russell Crowe and Rene - truly had no idea he was such a great actor...will definitely be recommending this movie to friends on Monday."
"deacon_blues-1","10","2","3","4 July 2005"," Ron Howard should take Russell Crowe to Disney World....
","I just can't say enough about Russell Crowe. Yet another, subtle, understated, nail-on-the- head performance. This guy is consummate! Too bad he won his Oscar for the wrong role. But hey, I guess he'll take what he can get. And a matching virtuoso directing job by Howard as well. The fight sequences were very effective, keeping me right in there with the clinches. Some have said that this is not a fight movie as much as a human-interest, character study. I find it eminently satisfying as both. I find myself fascinated, once again, with Howard's choice of subject matter and dedication to effective and entertaining presentation of the material. I really am not aware of all the liberties, if any, he has taken with the factual material, but as with ""A Beautiful Mind"" and many other such historical studies, I am not very concerned about them. I have always felt that movie directors should have as much literary license as other artists, since myth and legend is just as much an effective part of our culture as history and fact. I don't depend on movies for my knowledge of history, just as I don't depend on history texts for my amusement. As long as a film doesn't lie about the essentials of a story in a blatant attempt to mislead, it can still be effective and laudable."
"bobcapl","10","2","3","20 June 2005"," Superb Film
","Yesterday was Father's Day and, as usual, my kids took me and their mama to the movies. It is something that I like so it's very cool. The film du jour was Cinderella Man.<br/><br/>First we had Rocky and then there was Raging Bull. Now we have James J. Braddock, the Cinderella Man. First and foremost let me say that this is easily the best film of the year, to date. It's a boxing film that isn't a boxing film. It leads you from good times in the twenties to the dire consequences of the depressive thirties. It's the story of a man, his wife, and his children. It's the story of the fat and the lean. It's the story of what you see isn't always what is real. It's the story of pride, passion, and existence. All told, it's a beautiful story.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays Jimmy Braddock. Russell, well, is Russell, and that's a good thing, he gets so deeply into this role that you want to cheer with and for him. You want to weep with and for him. I left the theater wanting to hug him, what a role, what a character. Renée Zellweger plays Mae Braddock, Jimmy's wife. She is a typical wife of the time, she wants to make Jimmy happy, loves him to death and rears their children with so much love that you want to hug her as well. Paul Giamatti is Jimmy's manager. If Paul gets overlooked for supporting actor for this role, I'm going to give up Oscar. There is a scene with Jimmy and his son, Jay, played by Connor Price that makes you want to tear your heartstrings out. Opie, er, Ron Howard has his best directing effort yet. I told my son that I think Ron may well be the finest director of his day, and he's right up there with any day, yesterday and tomorrow. The entire supporting cast is simply wonderful. I wanted to strangle Max Baer, played by Craig Bierko. The fight scenes are well choreographed, maybe a bit bloody, but it's a bloody sport. I can see this film getting multiple Oscar nominations, even if it is early in the film season, it's that powerful. This is not a movie easily forgotten.<br/><br/>Did I mention that I liked this film? I highly recommend it to all.........."
"asc85","6","2","3","19 June 2005"," Unfair to Max Baer
","This film is definitely worth seeing, but is also definitely NOT in the class of ""A Beautiful Mind."" While I'm usually a Russell Crowe fan (as an actor, that is), I wasn't overly impressed with his performance, although I think he did a good job. As someone from New Jersey, I was particularly impressed with Zellweger's dead-on accent, which made her sound like my Aunt! That being said, I was stunned at the ""poetic license"" taken in a completely unfair portrayal of Max Baer. I don't think anything I've ever read or seen has ever portrayed him in such a negative light. I understand why it was done in this movie, but it also makes me wonder how many other parts of the movie didn't really happen, but were shown for ""dramatic effect."" I'm not asking for 100% accuracy (see Hitler's last days in ""Downfall""), but playing this loose with the facts hurts ""Cinderella Man's"" credibility."

","Ron Howard has reached the pinnacle of cinematic achievement. This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. There is not one false note or misplaced frame. We nearly had to carry my 78 year-old mother out of the theater she was so wrung out. She remembered hearing the last fight scene on the radio, which only made it better for my 22 year old daughter and me. It was also great to be able to TAKE my Mom to a movie without being mortified by gratuitous sex scenes.<br/><br/>Ron Howard may be the last American Icon; from Opie 'til today he has never let us down, nor lowered his high standards. If all Hollywood or American media was like this, our country would be a better place.<br/><br/>God bless."

","What is with all this wailing about how Baer was really a nice guy? Baer himself admitted to not taking Baddock seriously and being a playboy. Braddock in the movie took the trash talking in stride. Ron Howard took the stories as they were portrayed by writers and the people that knew him. Sure, Baer has his side of the story, but you can't dispute he was reprimanded for low blows and a back hand. Hmmmm?<br/><br/>I am sure he wasn't a complete jerk, but I don't think the movie made him to be all that bad other than a very intimidating boxer who didn't take Braddock seriously. <br/><br/>The boxing matches were not overdone but were enacted with enough grit and detail without upstaging the real story:::::A good man rising above adversity with dignity in a brutal and unforgiving sport for all the right reasons.

","Films about the Great Depression are tricky, because in a time when one must pay nine dollars to see a movie, it is hard to make an audience understand the level of desperation people lived in during that time. Ron Howard's Cinderella Man, starring Russell Crowe as long shot heavyweight contender Jim Braddock, skillfully and subtly weaves in stories of daily life during the depression, into the fabric of what could have been a conventional boxing story. Superbly acted and flawlessly made, Cinderella Man is a depression piece worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The film begins in 1929 where a young Jim Braddock is close to a shot at the heavyweight championship. The main characters are quickly introduced before the film jumps ahead five years, where an older Braddock loses his boxing license after an ugly fight. We learn he lost his championship bout as well as most of his money in stocks, and that age and injury have stripped away any promise he once had. Struggling to pay the bills, Braddock is forced to freelance work on the New York docks where a broken hand hurts his chances of being hired for a day's work.<br/><br/>During the early parts of the film it would have been easy for Ron Howard to try and drum up sympathy for the common American man by inserting overhead shots of long lines at soup kitchens, while some languid score played on. Instead Howard chooses smaller scale scenes to punctuate the harsh realities of daily life. In the films most powerful moment, Jim goes down to Madison Square Garden and in front of sportswriters and boxing promoters, who once knew him as a powerful fighter, begs for spare change so he can have the heat turned back on at his home.<br/><br/>Eventually Braddock's longtime trainer Joe Gould (the brilliant Paul Giamatti) gets him a fight against a heavily favored opponent. Braddock, whose injuries have healed, wins and keeps winning, building a large working class fan base and re-building his reputation as a boxer. This leads to a showdown match with killer heavyweight champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), and Braddock's last chance to achieve financial security.<br/><br/>Crowe's performance is the heart of the film, because with Braddock he creates a layered character instead of a Rockyesque thug. In the film's best scene, boxing promoter Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) tries to convince Braddock to back out of the championship fight lest Braddock get hurt and Johnston become liable. Braddock explains, with just a hint of disgust at Johnston's lack of understanding, that fighting Bierko is no less dangerous than working as cheap labor at the docks, and at least in the ring he knows where all the punches are coming from.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man should contend for several Oscars come next February and is another notch in the belts of both Crowe and Howard. The film never becomes a conventional boxing story or tries to generalize depression suffering. It stays true to its main character, a man who fights so he can have a say in his family's economic situation, allowing it to resonate with its audience throughout its entirety.<br/><br/>Four out of Four Stars"

","This was definitely one of the year's best!!! I loved Rocky, and this gave me so much of that heart-pounding adrenaline that Rocky's fights gave me. Although Jim was no Rocky, Mae was no Adrian, and Joe was certainly no Mickey, they did one helluva job!!! This is definitely a must see! The fights were great, the crowds were always loud, whether cheering or booing. There were some really great shots, like when he came on for one of the fights, and it gives you a shot of what he's seeing when he ducks under the ropes. You see everyone sideways, because he's ducking etc... Renee did a wonderful job. She's a truly gifted actress, and although there wasn't that much actual acting in this one, she still did what she was supposed to do, and she did it wonderfully. Loved Russell's accent!!"
"mOVIemAN56","10","2","3","5 June 2005"," Amazing. The Best Film of '05 So Far
","I went to see Cinderella Man last night not expecting much more than a good acting job from Giamatti and Crowe. Was I way off! The film follows the true-life story of legendary boxer James Braddock through his life during the Great Depression. The film starts with Jim breaking his hand, thus ending his prominent career and the family entering the Great Depression.<br/><br/>Jim, his wife Mae, and their three kids struggle to survive through the winter of 1933 and to make ends meet to pay for electricity. Soon Jim is desperate for money and his ex-coach Joe Gould shows up wanting to help. He says that he has a fight for him against up-and-coming boxer Corn Lewis. After an unbelievable match, the underdog, who was picked to be K.O. in the first round wins. His life is now sent into boxing again, something he never thought he'd do again.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully filmed rotating from shots of the boxing ring to the Hooverville in Central Park. The fight scenes (boxing actually) are creatively edited and filmed with style. You really get sense for the fighters and actually feel like your getting hit at a few scenes. But each fight scene is in good taste and truly shows what Braddock had to overcome. Not to much blood which also I think helped the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe is good as ever but overshadowing him is my new favorite actor Paul Giamatti playing Joe. Giamatti is a bit of comic relief, a sense of hope, and a caring character destined to help his friend and partner. Renee Zellweger is better then usual, she isn't annoying and gives an excellent performance. Even Craig Bierko is able to portray Max Baer (Braddock's foe in the final bout) as a strong, impressive boxer, capable of killing his opponent in the ring.<br/><br/>One down side is some parts of the movie are a bit to sentimental. But even those are few and far between. Character development is average. Renee Zellweger's character is never really developed nor the family. Giamatti and Crowe's character's expand though and develop. Still the story is good, you almost want to cry at some scenes and you're on the edge of your seat ever fight scene, especially the final with Baer. This film is just a step below Raging Bull (1980) which is pretty good considering that Raging Bull is one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man. Starring: Russel Crowe, Paul Giamatti, Renee Zellweger, Connor Price, Craig Bierko, and Paddy Considine.<br/><br/>5 out of 5 Stars."

My favorite scene of the movie is when he starts to get back into boxing so he can provide for his family. The plot of this movie is that he was making a lot of money doing boxing and then the great depression came and he had lost a fight so we wasnt getting enough money to provide for his family. so he went out and started working multiple jobs. I knew that the great depression was a horrible time in life i knew that it was hard to get money and it was a very poor time period. I feel like i have watched movies set in this time period but none of them come to my mind. No there was no evidence that showed that it was made up. The director of the movie is Ron Howard. James J.

That said this is an amazing action-packed film and had many in my class cheering the Cinderella Man on. The movie starts with Braddock (played by Russell Crowe) being at the top of his game and beating many opponents in boxing matches. Then the Great Depression hits and Braddock breaks his hand leaving him jobless with a family to support. Then he gets back into the game and wins and becomes champion! This movie is not a rags to riches it is riches to rags and back to riches. The movieÂ´s historic scenes seem accurate enough for me to believe that this was an awful time for many people and that Jim Braddock brought hope to the downtrodden masses.

","Cinderella Man is the story of James J. Braddock, an American boxer who looses his rise to fame at the beginning of the Great Depression. This movie has such a feeling and an emotion exerted from it that many films strive for but lack. The love between him and his wife and kids, between him and his coach. The ups and downs he and his friends and family face in this movie really show the feeling of the Great Depression.
When it comes down technically to this movie, it performs amazingly. The shots are layered and composed so well. The filtering and color balance of the shots creates a sort of world and atmosphere that pulls you, adding a layer on top of the story and acting. The casting as well was brilliant.Russel Crowe both in looks and acting pulls off an astounding performance as Braddock. Renee Zellwegger is a fitting role for Braddock's wife Mae. Crowe paired with the accent and style of Paul Giamatti make the team look like unstoppable underdogs.

It's such a good story of the underdog making a comeback and taking everyone by surprise but it also really represents how the Great Depression took a toll on people. The movie shows Braddock's family go through the typical trials of the Great Depression and hitting rock bottom after all his success fails him, then we see his claim to fame and how all his friends and family rallied around him as he did so, however, it took a toll on his wife who didn't want him to fight in fear he would be killed during the championship match against Baer. I really liked the good feeling of the movie when the person everyone wants to win (the underdog) finally does, instead of dying. I don't like watching fighting but it's a key scene in this movie so I watched it anyways. I've seen a few movies by this director and I've loved them all, they're all very appealing and have good story lines. I would definitely watch more movies by this director."

","""Cinderella Man"" follows a venture by James J. Braddock, a popular boxer within the 1920's. However, his title is diminished following the start of the Great Depression, and the story follows the struggles he and his family face within the 1930's. This film is absolutely magnificent, and is a thrill to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>The Great Depression within America was nothing short of a catastrophe. It is described by several as the worst war the United States has ever fought, and left many to fend for themselves and even starve. The severity of the situation is greatly portrayed through the story of ""Cinderella Man."" Braddock himself goes through several challenges throughout this period, one being trying to keep his head above debt by working at the docks. All of these personal struggles within Braddock's life helps with the relative and personal aspect of the Great Depression, and really provides an aided eye to the viewer when trying to understand the time period.<br/><br/>This piece is more than extravagant, and gets more praise simply by providing an unbelievable amount of depth than just the life of a boxer. It expands upon the socioeconomic issues of the time, and helps viewers further understand the kinds of struggles that were faced within the Great Depression. It is a rare occurrence for director Ron Howard to fail in covering all bases within effective storytelling, and this film stands as one of his triumphs, continuing to knock out the competition for decade to come."

","I hadn't heard of this movie until I watched it, but I really ended up enjoying it. The beginning was kind of slow and I feel it took a while to pick up. Once the story started progressing, it became really interesting. Despite the slow parts, I think the acting made up for it. Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger's performance was great. We also get to see a look inside how some people lived during The Great Depression and how people had to get by to survive. I'd never heard of James Braddock before so it was really interesting to learn his story. I've seen a lot of Ron Howard's films and this is probably one of my favorites."

The special effects in this film were amazing as well. The punches looked like they were actually punching them. This was a true story so all of this film was historical accurate films.

","I watched this movie because it was next on the list. The filmmaker is telling the story of James Braddock's come back. He got old and many thought he'd stop fighting. James came was the underdog in many fights but manage to surprise everyone. The special effects and make up are very well done. They aren't excessive at all. This can be used to determine it was a pretty recent movie. I don't know anything about boxing legends so i can't say anything there. As for the great depression portion of the movie; there's nothing that makes me question the accuracy. I haven't seen any other boxing movies and i don't remember any movies that showed how bad the depression was. The lady literally stole a steak from a fancy place because they couldn't afford any food. I liked the comeback story. How even with a broken hand he kept working and fighting. I also like how a steak was stolen. I didn't like how the earlier scenes seemed to cut to different things instead of flowing. All in all it was a great movie. I don't care about seeing more movies with the actors but i would like to see more from the director."

","I watched this film in my history class. This movie had me hooked throughout most the movie. This film shows the great depression and all the struggles that went with that. IT showed a boxing world champion fall from the top because of the great depression and showed how hard it was to get it back. The fighting scenes were a little unrealistic but its a movie what can you expect. Some of the shots that went negative when a punch lanced bothered me because it didnt look right. I dont have any questions about the accuracy besides fight scenes. Ive seen many boxing films and they are also really good. I liked how intense the fights were. I liked that it showed the struggles it made me thankful for the things I have today. I also liked how god the movie made you feel after he won the fight. I didnt like the parts were it was slow and could have used more. The movie overall was very god and I would like to see it along with others like it again. The actors also were very good and showed us how hard life was back then."

","This would probably be the best movie I've seen in the classroom. I liked how James went back into boxing so he can provide food and money for his family. I also liked when he said ""I told my kids I would bring the title back but they thought I said I would bring turtles."" The thing I liked the most was when Braddock won and how he always had pride. I disliked how Max thought he had it in the bag and the way he was talking smack. That shows to never be cocky and underestimate your opponents. This movie showed that even in the hard times you can make it and do something good for you and your family if you try hard enough."

","This film is a heart warming, underdog tale. It shows a man go from everything to nothing and then back to the top. The main character lives through the great depression and it shows the power that love can bring people to. He looks for a better future with his kids the best that he did was fighting for milk. During the hard times he worked with a broken hand and made sure that his kids were taken care of only he hoped that he wouldn't have to send them away but his wife did that all on her own. The historical accuracy of the film is mostly good I think. It is good entertainment. The based on a true story is amazing to see such an underdog in real life power through is just bewildering me."

This movie had a powerful beginning and end that had lots of interesting conflicts and action added into the story. 2 of the main fighters both from different social classes agree to fight in a big match to see who's the overall best boxer. One man fights for family and love and one for fame and money. Throughout the story you can kinda see how far that gets the man in the higher class.

Eventually the commission strips him and doesn't allow him to box anymore so he has to work on the docks using his bad hand more.

","This film was so absorbing, so believable, with every moment and relationship depicted with a sense of truth, that I was motivated to go on Wikipedia to see how close it was to reality. <br/><br/>I stopped the video at one point when Jim was having a heart to heart talk with his wife, stepping out to the sidewalk so the kids wouldn't overhear it. I went back to listen again to the distant sound of a dog barking, ever so faintly. Few were aware of this and you can't stop a film in a theatre, but this exemplified the multitude of touches that was everywhere.<br/><br/>No throwaway scenes or conversations that didn't advance the characters and the story. In my research I noted that most everything was as is happened, all except this, which is the depiction of Max Baer, who he fought for the heavyweight title. <br/><br/>It wasn't that they were just opponents, but beyond the inherent violence in boxing, he was depicted as egregiously vicious, gaining pleasure not just winning but destroying his opponents, on and off the ring. So, in reading about him, I discovered this was not the man at all. He courageously wore a Star of David on his trunks, since he was a quarter Jewish, as an personal statement to the Nazis in Germany and the America of that time. He did cause the death of two of his opponents, but suffered great emotional pain, and did what he could for the families. <br/><br/>The turning of him into a caricature of evil personified, didn't even add to the quality of the film, as in retrospect he should have been depicted as the full human being, that was so well done for the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>Max Baer has descendants who don't need to have their forebear defamed, for no reason at all."

Knows as the Cinderella man, he became one of the greatest sports sensations in the History of Boxing. In the early 1930's Braddock body, was wrecked down, crushed up and was not as good of a fighter as he once was. At this point in his career, he is struggling, and he is fighting with a broken hand. His wife Renée Zellweger starring as Mae Braddock hates his profession, but still tend to support him even though she is scared that he might get injured. His wife wishes, he quits the sport altogether but knows that they need the extra funds to survive. Watering down milk to get by a few extra days, and living with no heat has become the common routine for Braddock's family.<br/><br/>The main theme of the story is that it is like a fairy tale, hence the name the Cinderella Man. Throughout the movie, you can see that Braddock handled the depression differently, compared to everyone else. He did not let it break him even though, he was going through a series of hardships and adversity with his family. From getting his boxing silence revoked, due to the fact his matches were not providing the necessary hype that promoters wanted he still had hope. He tried in any way to help his family, to make it through. Unfortunately, due to the unfortunate circumstances, for the fear of the kids getting sick, Mae send her children to her family. This is the breaking point for James and he is very devastated. He starts to get on government assistance and asks for additional help from his boxing team and his manager Paul Giamatti, known as Joe Gould.<br/><br/>The effect of editorial cutting and transition of the pace of the film was very effective. It helped portray the life struggled of the depression and what the Braddock family was going through. The constant flashbacks, throughout the end of the film played a major role and made the audience realize who James was really fighting for. The background music played a major role as well because it provided the mood of which the scene was heading towards. When James had to bury his friend Mike Wilson, the music was very sad and miserable.<br/><br/>The theme is like the movie the ""Invincible"" which has the fairy like theme, of an underdog making it at the very end and proving everyone else wrong. As the movie goes on Joe pays a visit to James. He offers him a fight to fight the 2nd contender in the World. James is miraculously able to beat him and this is the beginning of the great winning streak. Joe convinces his Boss, to give James another chance and he is able to get another shot. This goes on until James end up beating the world heavyweight champion and make world history. This to a lot of people meant that Hope was on the way especially in those times. There was priest, churches and everyone in the community rooting for James. It was like a fairy tale, which is why the Cinderrela Man is a great title for this movie."

","This film is a heart-warming story of one man's relentless struggle to succeed. Jimmy's determination makes it possible for him to overcome the odds and go on to be a champion in the ring. This film shows us that even when things appear hopeless, nothing is impossible! Cinderella Man is reminiscent of the iconic Rocky film series. In these films, we root for the under-dog, hoping he will defeat his arrogant and deadly opponent. As viewer's, we develop an emotional connection to these characters and their families. We fear for their safety and want desperately for these fighters to be victorious. Jimmy and Rocky are resilient in their battles and neither give up hope as they both show great determination in the face of adversity. The lighting techniques used in Cinderella Man are very natural. In certain parts of this film, the lighting reflects the despair of The Depression. These scenes are dark and dreary, projecting the emotions of a poverty-stricken family as they struggle to stay together. Bright bursts of camera flashes are also used during the film. This technique added to the realism and excitement of these scenes. During the fight with Max Baer (Craig Bierko), different angles of shots help to tell the story. Close-up shots are used to show the emotions of Jimmy and Max. This angle is also used to show the injuries that are being inflicted on each man during the fight. Wide-angle shots are used to show the action of the fight in greater detail and to show the enormity of the crowd. This allows the viewer to feel like he or she is a part of this event. A subjective point of view is used during the fight as well. This gives the viewer a chance to see the fight from Jimmy's perspective. After the fight, Jimmy is lifted above the rest of the crowd with the light shining brightly on him. The angle expresses Jimmy's superiority over Max. The light symbolizes his win and the end of the Braddock family's struggles. Cinderella Man reminds viewers that no matter how difficult times may be, nothing is impossible. Even though things seemed hopeless for the Braddock family, Jimmy's determination made it possible for him to overcome hardship and become a world champ!"

","I remember watching this movie as a 14 year old and it made a massive impression on me. I have watched many sports movies but none come close to this one in terms of being inspirational and as well acted. Russell Crowe's performance as James J Braddock to me rates alongside Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker in The Dark Knight as the finest I have seen in a movie. Cinderella Man showed the struggle of a country struggling through the Great Depression in an appropriate and gritty manner and also showed Braddock's struggle to help his family survive through it. The boxing scenes were brilliant and incredibly realistic. Paul Giamatti's performance as Braddock's manager was sublime and along with Renee Zellweger's performance as Braddock's wife (Mae) who's chemistry alongside Crowe was incredlble. The final fight scene where Braddock faces Baer in the final round with the radio announcer calling it (much to the dismay of Mae) is still something I get goosebumps watching. This, to me, is the best film I have seen and appropriately does justice to the life of one of America's greatest real life underdog tales"
"rcrill","9","1","1","3 May 2016"," A Knock Out Story
","This is a classic story that you see someone go from nothing at all to having success and having everything he could imagine. James Braddock (Russel Crowe), a once proud and successful boxer had the glory and won every bout he ever fought. With the difficult time with the Great Depression and the injured hand he had, it was really hard for him to fight and let alone even get booked for a fight. This lead James to take odd jobs just to make ends meet to take home to his wife Mae Braddock (Renee Zellweger) and family. This lead James to go to his promoter Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) to do anything to get back into the ring. Joe went ahead and finally got James booked for a fight. Unfortunately, James had to fight the number two contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. Everyone in the boxing world didn't give James a shot to win. He proved everyone dead wrong. By gaining a victory, that put him in position for a championship bout. Again being the underdog, he rose to the occasion to become the World Heavyweight Champion. He overcame all the odds to find new found glory and this time he had time to enjoy and soak it in. <br/><br/>I feel that this movie had a reference towards Rocky. Not just because it is about boxing, but it also has that feel good success story element to the film. It also has a feel with the kind of cities that they grew up in. James lived in a rough part of New Jersey and Rocky was in a hard environment of Philadelphia. One last thing is how and where they did their training. They both had dimly lit gyms, old gear, and a ring that looked like it was on its last leg. The only difference about the two would be the time of history that these two movies took place. <br/><br/>The one element that I would say about Cinderella Man would be the lighting. During his decline of fame, everything had a dark feeling. James and Mae's house was the perfect example. They went without power and ran their house with candles. Secondly, the gym that he was training in. It just had a feeling of sadness and hardships. On the other hand, the movie had great lighting at times. Once he found his glory again, it was camera flashes, big time arena crowds, and an overall positive attitude. Next, I would have to say that the motif was a good element to the movie. It kept on showing the crowds at different bouts and his difficult living conditions. <br/><br/>Overall, I found this to be a great movie. This shows that anything can be accomplished when you put the work and force into anything to want to do in life. It all comes down to the old saying, if you want it, go get it."

"nmholland","8","1","1","15 February 2016"," Follows the ""Boxing Movie"" Cliché, But Still A Good Filim
","Cinderella Man is directed by Ron Howard and stars Russell Crowe as James Braddock, a rags to riches boxer that tries to make a life during the Great Depression. The story follows Braddock, and his wife (Renee Zellweger) as he rises from a very bad boxer, to a very good boxer, and the conflicts that this causes in his marriage, and the ever so hard time known as the Depression.<br/><br/>Ron Howard, the director, is known by many people as Opie Taylor. However, he is also a pretty good, and well known, director in Hollywood. He's directed such movies as The Da Vinci Code, A Beautiful Mind (also with Russell Crowe), and even Apollo 13. He's done some pretty good films, and this one lives up to the others. While on the topic of Ron Howard, I might as well mention the directing. The directing in this movie is actually pretty good. During the fight scenes, he films the action pretty well. There aren't an overabundance of cuts, and he used a lot of wide shots when Braddock was in the ring. I was impressed with the directing.<br/><br/>The cinematography was also pretty good. Some people may not like it, because it's dark and dreary, but I liked that quite a bit. It expresses how hard the Depression was, and it symbolizes the people's' lives. Their lives were dark, and nothing seemed to work out. This is also true for the story's protagonist, which leads me into my next positive.<br/><br/>The characters were very likable. I truly understood why James had to fight, and I also understood why his wife, Mae, didn't want him to. She needed him to be able to take care of the family, and he thought he was doing so by fighting. He saw fighting as a way to make money, and she saw it as an easy way to get killed. These characters are a literary device known as a foil; they contrast each other. However, this somewhat reflected on another couple involved with the boxing business, and for those of you who have seen the Rocky films, you know exactly what I'm talking about. James and Mae are a pretty clear image of Rocky and Adrian, which could easily bring the movie down, if not set in such a specific time period as the Depression was.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Rocky films, James' final opponent, Max Baer, reminded me of Ivan Drago, from Rocky IV. Both men were known for killing opponents in the ring, and being very strong, yet the protagonist still insists on fighting them. The last two points could easily be summarized by the ""boxing movie"" cliché. This cliché is abundant through all boxing films, not just this one. It is easily recognizable in other movies, such as The Fighter, Raging Bull, or Southpaw. This, however, can be excused by the difficulty to differentiate themselves from other boxing films.<br/><br/>So, overall, my main problem with the film is it's obvious cliché, yet I liked almost everything else about the movie. I think Cinderella Man should receive a B, or an 8 out of 10."

","What an expected great movie! Perhaps in the beginning we can find it a bit slow...however after the first half an hour, the story starts to build up. Russell and René play so good and the chemistry between them looks so natural. The moving scene when he puts his family over his pride and asks for help... the integrity he showed when he gave back the money he got as social benefit once he got into a better situation. The last fight!! what a fight and we do not really know what the result would be... 50- 50. I loved this movie! It was interesting and showed how circumstances played a role, and how integer people could stay. It is a long movie, worth to be watched."

","Cinderella Man (2005): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Craig Bierko, Bruce McGill: A rags to riches story regarding boxer James Braddock during the depression. After an injured hand he struggles to provide for his family but when a fighter cancels out he is given a one shot deal that ends with his comeback. This story has been done countless times since Rocky but when done right, as in the case here, we still cheer the results. Director Ron Howard previously worked with Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind. This is another successful collaboration. Howard concentrates more on the family issue, which allows this film to excel. Crowe embodies the role of Braddock who goes from struggling husband to successful boxer but his championship is no surprise. Renee Zellweger is wonderful as his wife who sticks by despite harsh times. Her decision not to attend the climatic bout is no surprise. Paul Giamatti steals scenes as Braddock's manager who is also suffering the affect of the employment situation. Craig Bierko plays boxer Max Baer who killed two fighters. He taunts Braddock's family but his fate is obvious. This can go down as one of the great boxing films with exciting ring action. Although we know the formula, the theme regards the underdog and the ability to rise above uncertain circumstances. Score: 9 / 10"

","Although Crowe isn't a fully emotional man, & you won't see him burst out in tears on screen that often, he is a force like no other. And this is perhaps his best performance. Thankfully, the director behind this film didn't try to be clever & move away from the formula. And it works. It just works! I felt that Robin Hood & Noah were long dead in the water before Russell ever stepped foot on set. A bad movie is defined very easily, & it is when the guy in the editing room wants to be center of attention - with frenetic strobe edits, Adobe After Effects, over-saturation resulting in loss of colour etc. Or when the director puts his own ""spin"" on a classic story by being ""original"". Originality, too many special effects, & unrealistic action doesn't make a good film. A great story does. And this is truly a perfect example.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is intelligent & modest, the score by Thomas Newman is typical Newman cues but fits extremely well in peeking your emotions, the editing is a little choppy at times but thankfully it doesn't split up the narrative too much, but the actors are the ones we can relate to. And they did a spectacular job here. Renee Zellwegger is really something special & shines bright even up against Crowe which can be hard.<br/><br/>Boxing is a violent sport & is so often affiliated with rage & a desire to look good. It's not very appealing for many. But here we have a man who is fighting for love. And that's what makes this so powerful. It's also a story of hope for the underdog. I can't help feeling that in my own reconciliation with free will, this story re-enforces my belief that we can change our destiny. For that alone, it is worth the watch, even if you don't like boxing."

","Much like a Great Depression version of Rocky. I considered Russle Crowe's performance great, along with Renee Zelwegger's, Paul Giammati's, and Craig Beirko's. Also the story was good, and was very engaging. Ron Howard did a good job directing, in fact it was a great job at direction. This is the story of an Irish-American boxer from New Jersey, who fights in the end to a victory against a boxer, who's killed two men in the ring, hoping to make the comeback boxer number three, for the world heavyweight championship. This was a very engaging story. The story acting and directing were great. That is why it's one of the greatest movies ever. Prefect! Seriously! I couldn't have been any better! I'm really serious!

","Cinderella Man is a film titled after the nickname of heavyweight boxing champion,James J. Braddock.It is inspired by his life story.The movie stars Russell Crowe as Braddock together with Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti. Ron Howard directs.<br/><br/>The story follows a boxing champion who achieved his greatest success against the most daunting odds of his life. In the 1920's, James Braddock was a promising contender in professional boxing.Then he suffered a 1929 defeat in a bout with light heavyweight champ Tommy Loughran that sent his career into a serious tailspin. As Braddock's career in the ring dried up, the Great Depression put a stake through the heart of America's economy, and he found himself working at the New York docks for pitiful wages as he tried to support his wife, Mae and three children. Desperate for money, he turned to his former trainer and manager Joe Gould,who set him up battling John Griffin.Despite the fact that he was too old and out of shape,he managed to upset Griffin that paved a way to a surprising comeback on the ring.He became an became a tonic to struggling workers and unemployed people, and all eyes were on Braddock when in 1935 he took on powerful heavyweight champion Max Baer. In one of the biggest achievements in boxing history, he defeats the seemingly invincible opponent to become the heavyweight champion of the world.<br/><br/>This film is definitely ranks among the top boxing films ever made such as:Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby and the Rocky movies.But compared to the movies mentioned previously,Cinderella Man is more powerful emotionally especially as an underdog story particularly.The Braddock- Baer fight was shot with sheer authenticity proves this point.Russell Crowe's portrayal makes Braddock fascinating and we are truly absorbed with the character that he plays and the situation that he was in during the hard times he experienced during The Great Depression and during his fight at the conclusion of the film.Overall,this is one great unforgettable and powerful underdog picture."

","After the success of A Beautiful Mind, Russell Crowe and Ron Howard teamed up again for Cinderella Man.<br/><br/>Now that Howard is an Oscar winning director, the story gets more ponderous and longer. He can also attract the best talent so we have Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger as part of the cast.<br/><br/>Crowe plays Jim Braddock, a depression era boxer who was down on his luck, in poverty who gets the chance to get back to boxing and ends up getting a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship.<br/><br/>In that case it's an inspiring and uplifting tale. However one of the writers of this film is Akiva Goldsman, I do not care if he has an Oscar for Best Screenplay. He is a supreme hack. I refer you to Batman & Robin as Exhibit A.<br/><br/>Howard who is one of the last protégé of Roger Corman who used to make zippy films in the 1980s but over the years has become more bloated.<br/><br/>In this film you feel some of the moves the director will make will be telegraphed just like a bad boxer."

","Ron Howard's Cinderella Man is certainly a true Hollywood Cinderella story. This film has the distinction of being one of the better boxing movies ever made. I think it's better than such classics like Rocky, Raging Bull, and The Fighter. I think what makes this story so powerful and motivating is the setting. This takes place during the Great Depression where nearly everyone was affected one way or the other.<br/><br/>This film is based on the true story of Jim Braddock. Braddock is a former boxer whose family has fallen on hard times. When he gets an opportunity to earn money as part of a one-game comeback, he has no idea how special this comeback will be.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. Russell Crowe puts up another fine performance as Braddock. Renee Zellweger is really good as Braddock's wife who cares deeply for her husband. Paul Giamatti is especially good as Braddock's manager.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that looks to provide some meaningful inspiration. This is a film not really about boxing, but how a struggling family persevered with little or no money. All the boxing scenes were executed well and I have never felt tense watching a on-screen boxing match as I did with the final battle in this movie. It was probably the best boxing match I have yet seen. Ron Howard has added another great character story to his filmography. I rate this film 10/10."
"vcastilino","8","1","1","23 October 2012"," Every bit for the family
","The movie is about the boxer James J. Braddock (Jim), the once down and out boxer who re-enters the ring purely for keeping his family alive and together. It is his love for his wife and three kids that sees him go on to become the world champion. What appealed to me was not the gory boxing bouts, shot realistically, but the tender sentiments of a man who promises to his eldest son never to let go of him, even in the worst of situations. The father keeps that promise!<br/><br/>Some of the most touching scenes: the moment Jim takes his son to the butcher shop to return the salami he stole and there outside promises never to let go of him; getting ready for the fight, on an empty stomach, he eats from the bowl straight with his mouth; when he tells his daughter a dream about him eating full and then drops his share of meat into her plate for her (thereby going hungry himself); when Mae enters the Church to pray for Jim and is told that so are all those who are there; the silence when Jim enters the ring for the championship bout...<br/><br/>All said and done why this movie appealed to me so much was not the movie itself (though superb acting by Crowe, Zewellger and Paul Giamatti) but because the movie in every way showed me what Papa was to us in our younger days. The same grit, same passion, the only dream to see us all happy and contented, the same LOVE MY PARENTS had for the family, especially when the going was tough! I still remember the days when money was hard in coming. Yet we, my brother and I, always had good things (not the best) but the way Papa and Mummy slogged for us, that what they gave us was the best of all! They fasted or ate stale food so that we could have the fresh meal. Rain or sun, cough or fever, nothing prevented Papa from going to work (each day counted).<br/><br/>Thank you Papa and Mummy... for what you were, are and what you made of us!<br/><br/>http://www.vcastilino.blogspot.in/"

","Cinderella Man always lifts me up, not only for the impressive underdog display.<br/><br/>The marriage triumph on the side of the boxing struggles is not underplayed. Russell Crowe is beautiful as usual, and his scenes with his wife, played by Miss Zellweger, are what keep me watching this movie over and over. Ron Howard creates a story that casts light on the struggles presented to families during the great depression without the expected scene of the family's love conquering all. Rather, scenes throughout the movie weave together a lovable family with a reasonable amount of problems. Unusually, the love involved isn't filled with too much physical demonstrations and I believe, because of this,the Braddock's love story is one of the best in the movies I've seen from this decade. <br/><br/>While, I will not admit to being a true romantic, this love story is one that definitely makes me hopeful that my husband will follow in Braddock's footsteps."

","9/10 hands down, and I feel that I am being far too harsh. What else can you say. In the movie, Paul Giamatti's character says, 'Sometimes you see something in a fighter. You don't even know if it real, you're looking for it so bad'. The same can be said of this movie. You look and look through a hundred films and then suddenly you stumble upon one that makes you sway, gives you goosebumps, and 'you don't know if it's real', it's so good. It changes who you are.<br/><br/>The eternal struggle of the middle class and the dogged, silent determination to fight against unearthly odds is the substrate on which this boxing movie is built, and it has been executed to perfection. The movie is Russell Crowe all the way and in my personal opinion this performance of his is better than The Maximus Decimus Meridius. When he stands amidst the club members begging for alms with tears of shame in his eyes you really get to see what metal he is made of.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger's short role is articulated with such finesse that you do not even realise that it has relatively so little screen time. She and Crowe share such a chemistry, even in their zero-glamour looks in zero-glamour surroundings.<br/><br/>Another standout performer is Paul Giamatti. The man always delivers but this one is out-of-the-blue extraordinary. The ramble he goes on after the first comeback fight is what I can watch all day long and not get bored. An Oscar was what was truly deserved, but I guess the judges didn't see the things I saw.<br/><br/>The final fight has been picturised as if it were a battle for life, not the title. The commentary and Round 11 makes your hair stand on end. You get so involved that you do not even realise that lasts for almost the entire last half-hour of the movie. Craig Bierko delivers a little gem as Max Baer. An unexpected yet pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>And finally, Ron Howard. Always been a fan of the man, but this movie points a finger to your eye and shows what a great director can achieve with a good script. He has even outdone himself in Cinderella Man and he has set the bar so high that none of his subsequent films have quite been upto the mark, in spite of them all being pretty good movies on their own.<br/><br/>It's not a movie, it's a legacy. It's a way of life.<br/><br/>It's just a rags to riches story, but it is the greatest one ever told."

","Timing can be everything when watching a movie. I saw this when it first came out and at the time it struck me as another in a long line of inspirational sports movies where the underdog does good and everyone lives happily ever after. But as I write this, the calendar is about to turn it's last page on 2011, and the country looks to the New Year with some of the same misgivings that it's citizens faced during The Great Depression. With a stagnant economy, high unemployment, and frustration with government at an all time high, conditions are ripe for someone like a James J. Braddock to capture the public imagination. Braddock's story is one of courage and inspiration, getting and taking that second chance and making the most of it with no outcome acceptable except success. Here was a man with a deep commitment to family values who could only take charity as a last resort and mark time until he could return payment in full. In that light, boxing is almost peripheral to the tale of Braddock's rise to glory. The man could take a beating but just kept coming back because defeat was not an option. The modern era could use a role model like James J. Braddock, someone with substance and character to help us understand that misfortune is temporary, and that hard work and perseverance will work out for the best."

"sddavis63","9","1","1","27 September 2007"," Great Rags To Riches Story
","This movie surely has to be counted as one of the great rags-to-riches stories in history, made more poignant by its basis in fact and more entertaining by the superb performances of the actors. Going into the movie I wasn't particularly familiar with James J. Braddock. I knew he had been the heavyweight champion of the world but knew nothing about his personal life and struggles. This movie certainly filled those gaps. The film offers a grittily realistic portrayal of life in the Great Depression as Braddock (Russell Crowe), once promising but now no longer able to box, struggles (and usually fails) to find enough work to support his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and children. He eventually descends from unemployment to welfare to begging just to pay the bills. The struggle was put into even greater perspective by some of the opening scenes which make it clear that Braddock and his family once lived a comfortable, middle-class life before the catastrophe hit.<br/><br/>Eventually, Braddock gets another shot at boxing - at first just a one-time shot, as a fill-in for an injured boxer because the promoters couldn't find anyone credible on short notice. Somehow Braddock regains his form and eventually turns that one-shot deal into a shot at the title against the fearsome champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko).<br/><br/>I understand Baer's family was upset with director Ron Howard's portrayal of the man. It's true that he didn't come across as Mr. Nice Guy, but based on some of the criticisms I had heard I was expecting to see Baer portrayed as some sort of sadistic monster. Actually, while he certainly taunted Braddock and said some unpleasant things to Mae Braddock (at least according to the movie) I didn't think he came across that badly. In the scene of the two coming across each other at the restaurant it seemed to me that Baer was portrayed as truly concerned about Braddock. Like everyone else, Baer (who had already killed two men in the ring) assumed that Braddock would not only lose the title fight; he'd lose badly. Baer's real message in that encounter seemed to be ""let's find a way out of this because I really don't want to hurt you."" It seemed to me that in the end Baer was also portrayed as a gracious loser once his fight with Braddock was over.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. There's very little to criticize, and it offers the always necessary reminder that no matter how hard you might fall, there's always a chance to get up. 9/10"

","I never heard of Jim Braddock nor Max Baer which helps in the suspense of this movie. It's well played by Russell Crowe and Renée Zellweger as a couple that lost everything in the stock market crash. Jim is desperate to keep the family together as the sensible thing to do is send the kids off to relatives until they can get back on their feet. Jim makes a promise to his oldest son that he will not let that happen. Having kids myself I could really relate to the fear of your family living on the street. The movie does a really good job in showing how bad it was to be able to work and yet have no work. With no way to take care of your family you feel the helplessness of the people. The boxing in the movie is a means to an end. This isn't Rocky. This movie has a lot more heart. IMHO."

","I began watching this and was completely roped in. From that opening shot, the grainy black and white photo of the boxer's jaw jutting at an impossible angle, and the it rocked right into live action. Also that opening quote about Jim Braddock was dang near perfect. I actually don't even like boxing movies, but there was something about Russell Crowes performance that was really solid and made you feel for him and the plight of his family. I think that's where it did get a bit thin for me -- the family dynamic. The kids really could have been drawn more fully -- but now that I write about it, it does't seem right. That probably would have only seemed like a easy way to make the audience feel pity. Speaking of family.... WHy does' Ron Howard keep putting his goofy brother in all his movies? Is that guy getting enough residuals from starring as a kid actor in GENTLE BEN? I don't know what that bothers me so much, perhaps because it takes me right out of the movie, makes me sit up and say, Oh, there's that goofy brother of Ron Howards again.... I'm sniping. I did like this movie. Good storytelling and Giamatti is fantastic -- He's so solid in everything he does."

The Direction of Ron Howard is simply amazing, the Cinematography is beautiful, the make-up is outstanding, the editing is great, and the performances between Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti are a K.O. Seriously, I don't know why this film wasn't nominated for a Best Picture in the Oscars, are they stupid because this film is much better than Crash, Brokeback Mountain, Capote, A History of Violence, and Good Night and Good Luck.

The camera is also fantastic, partly by doing a great job in immersing us into the atmosphere and 'feel' of the 1930-ies and then (and especially) for the authenticity of the boxing scenes.

He has lost fight after fight, and the boxing commission has revoked his license. The rest of the movie is his climb back to the top and becomes the champion.<br/><br/>In my opinion, a really good movie makes your heart pound. This movie is one of the few that I have seen that does it repeatedly. The final fight with Max Baer, (Craig Bierko) is one of the most intense scenes in a movie I have ever seen. My heart took 10 minutes to calm down after it. Also, the acting was very good especially Russel Crowe. The cinematography and directing were also very good.<br/><br/>Now, for the bad: The only thing I have to say is that the plot often dragged. Some of the scenes before he gets good at boxing were the sole reason that I did not rate this movie a 10. Now, like all 13 year old boys, I like action in movies. However, this does not mean that I need it constantly, like some do. But I think that many of the non-boxing scenes could have been omitted or shortened.

","Been waiting to see this for a while and was very happy with the result.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man retells the true story of Jim Braddick (played brilliantly by Russell Crowe), a boxer who starred around the time of the Great Depression. Braddick rose to prominence before the depression until he was beset by injuries and soon became a real battler. Braddick soon goes from riches to rags as he is forced from the ring and into normal society where he struggles like everyone else to find work and feed the family. Braddick and his family of three kids and wife (Zelwegger) soon can't pay the bills and struggle to put food on the table. Braddick is soon given a second chance when a boxer is needed at the last moment for a big fight due to a last minute pull out. No-one wants the fight with the lack of preparation, but Braddick will do anything for some extra cash. Originally this was supposed to be a one-off fight, but when Braddick shockingly wins things become very different. Will he get another shot? Will his family survive the depression? See it, or read a boxing history book, but the movie is pretty good and you should see it."
"jhn_morton","7","1","1","2 May 2006"," The inspirational story of depression era boxing champion James J. Braddock
","Cinderella man is the inspirational story of depression era boxing champion James J. Braddock played by Russell Crowe who came from nowhere to defeat the world title holder Max Baer.A former heavyweight contender Braddocks career goes downhill as a result of injuries and after seeing his savings wiped out in the stock market crash he is forced to work on the docks to feed his family until he is given a last minute fight against a fighter ranked no2 in the world. Braddock wins the fight and from then on his career goes from strength to strength culminating in the title fight. Braddock's riches to rags to riches tale proves inspirational to millions of other ordinary Americans who've seen their savings wiped out and are struggling to get by and he quickly becomes a hero. It would perhaps be easy to dismiss this film as Gladiator goes boxing and certainly Crowe pretty much plays the role in exactly the same manner and is certainly operating within himself. However such is the power of the true story on which its based and the skill of the direction that I found myself rolling with every punch and cheering Braddock on too his inevitable victory. While formulaic and lacking either the rawness of Raging Bull or the sheer cheesy joy of Rocky Cinderella man is a thoroughly entertaining way to spend a boring Tuesday night and its hard not to identify with the story of an ordinary decent man fighting against adversity to build a better life for himself and his children. One interesting thing is the portrayal of Baer himself who by all accounts was not the monster portrayed in the film who revels in his reputation as a killer. While Baer's clowning is seen as disrespectful and contemptuous to his opponents those who knew him say that it actually stemmed from a desire to entertain and impress the judges without unleashing his fearsome right hand as he was actually a man racked with guilt as a result of the tragedies he had been involved in. Rather like Chris Eubank after the fight which left Michael Watson severely brain damaged. Its also interesting that while in real life the part Jewish Baer wore a prominent Star of David on his trunks, worn for the first time against German fighter Max Schmeling whom he defeated, in the film the star is dramatically scaled down so as to be practically unnoticeable. So while clearly happy to portray Baer as an ogre director Ron Howard and Hollywood in general don't seem happy to have the audience rooting for an Irishman against a Jew. That said good film and I enjoyed it."

"hall895","7","1","1","24 March 2006"," Uplifting and inspiring but could be more entertaining
","There is no denying that Cinderella Man is a feel-good movie. The true story of Depression-era boxer James Braddock is among the most uplifting that sport has to offer. The film does a great job of bringing that story to life. It draws you in in such a way that it is impossible not to be a huge James Braddock fan by the time the final scenes play out. You see what makes this amazing man tick, the love he has for his family, the willingness to do anything for those he loves. You see the courage and determination that was required just to get by in this poverty-stricken time. You see this seemingly broken, beaten-down fighter show the heart of a champion. You see all this and you can't help but be inspired as Braddock's amazing story plays out before you. But there's the sense that something's missing. For all that this film has going for it there is a certain energy missing. It takes a while to get going and while there are bursts of energy throughout that energy is never really sustained. The pacing, or rather the lack of pacing, keeps a very good movie from being something truly great.<br/><br/>While the story may move a little slowly at times the fact does remain that it is a truly wonderful story. And the actors who bring this story to life all do a tremendous job. As Braddock, Russell Crowe gives another in a long line of remarkable performances. Balancing the heart of this amazing family man with the strength of this amazing champion is no small feat and Crowe is to be commended for pulling it off so brilliantly. Very few actors would have been up to the task. Also reliably terrific is Paul Giammati as Braddock's manager, Joe Gould. Giammati may seem a little over the top at times in his portrayal but it works. Much of the energy the film does have comes from him. Portraying Braddock's wife, Renee Zellweger is solid if not spectacular. This is clearly Crowe's film all the way and Zellweger is left to play off of him and she does so admirably. Other familiar faces including Bruce McGill, Paddy Considine and Craig Bierko have smaller, but still important, roles and each of these actors also turns in fine work.<br/><br/>So what we have is a terrific story which is wonderfully performed. Should be an absolute knockout. But Cinderella Man never quite hits the heights one might hope. It's certainly a very good film, one worth seeing especially if you need a little pick-me-up. You can't help but be inspired. But you may wish you were a little more entertained."

","""Cinderella Man"" beautifully captures the depression era when despair was constant and hope was nothing more than a dream. That dream is Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) who captures the character. His talk, his walk, his style in the ring are all picture-perfect. You root for they guy because he is an underdog, a caring soul who gives back his relief money when things start to turn his way.<br/><br/>The children have that depression look about them. You feel their hunger as well as their pride for their champion-bound father.<br/><br/>Renee Zellwegger's finest hours come midway into the picture. I found her first part to be a contrived performance, best imitating a mixture of Alice Kramden and Sally Struthers. However, when the chips are down, she can pack an emotional wallop which the picture does as well.<br/><br/>The scenes of Hoovervilles are realistic and compelling.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti has been nominated for best supporting actor for his performance as Braddock's trainer. He is there all the way, especially in the fight scenes, giving much needed supported encouragement to Braddock.<br/><br/>The film has been criticized for its depiction of Max Baer as a womanizer, and overall miserable character.<br/><br/>The film may also promote an anti-boxing feeling given that Baer killed 2 people in the ring and seemed to get pleasure out of it. We must remember that Crowe, in the final analysis, is the real hero for fighting his way out of the depression as well as the emotional ""wallops"" that he takes as well in the ring.<br/><br/>A memorable film which is well worth the effort."

","Russel Crowe and Ron Howard are a really good combination and their efforts have been once again compounded for creating a great biopic. Crowe is excellent in his role, as well as the other characters. The setting might be somehow corning (Depression Era, a fighter struggling with poorness..)but the result is in my opinion a combination of sentiment, history and boxing proficiency. The film talks to the heart developing a captivating plot. Plus, it got excellent performances from Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti as well. Finally, the comparison with ""Million Dollar Baby"" doesn't stand up too much coz that movie was more tear jerker."

","From the moment you start watching Cinderella Man, in the back of your mind you realise where it is going to end. It is an old Hollywood story that we have all seen many times before, however, only every once and a while is the complete winning formula relayed onto the screen.<br/><br/>After last years masterpiece in Million Dollar Baby many have said that the boxing movie has had its resurrection and is due to be packed away for a few more years until a fresh new face comes along to tackle the topic again. But for two years running now, boxing movies have delivered the knockout punches.<br/><br/>Basically, Cinderella Man is a wonderful film. We are taken back into 1920's America where down and out boxer Jim Braddock is struggling to keep food on the table for his wife and three kids, as the depression strikes. Braddock's boxing career is coming to an end, too old and injured to fight. Too little work around to feed the family, and the hard times hit. After a few years off the scene a come by chance boxing resurrection comes Braddock's way. From here we follow Braddock in his quest to climb to the top of the American boxing ranks, even if he is an old has been.<br/><br/>Firstly, the acting is superb. Russell Crowe delivers a stellar performance as the Irish boxer. Crowe creates his character with ridiculous ease, there is not a single moment where he slips, if not his greatest performance it is on a par with A Beautiful Mind. Zelwegger is great (especially in the final scenes of the film - where she doesn't even deliver a line) Giamatti is also first rate. Honestly, you could not pick a single character in the film that was poorly cast or acted.<br/><br/>Ron Howards direction is of course excellent, each scene makes us feel like we are right in the thick of the action (the crowds at the fights really make you feel like you are there, the cheering is sensational). To start picking out faults in the film would be unfair, because as an entire it is near flawless and to attract attention to the issues one has with certain aspects would be silly.<br/><br/>There is no doubt you have seen this story before, but rarely is it told this good. And when delivered with such heart, energy and elegance you have no choice but to sit back and savour every moment. 8/10"
"hzecher48","10","1","1","13 July 2005"," Outstanding film, enormously authentic
","One major point of controversy on this film was its apparent demonizing of Max Baer, in particular, the restaurant scene where Baer almost gloats over killing two men in the ring. In fact, for the rest of his life, he wept or got teary whenever Frankie Campbell's name was mentioned; he lost all his passion for boxing when Campbell died; and never again fully opened up on an opponent. <br/><br/>It is also hard to imagine Baer, playboy that he was, openly propositioning Braddock's wife. Not impossible, but I would think it unlikely. Max Baer was an enormously gifted but inconsistent fighter, and preferred to play the clown; but, by all accounts he was a nice man, tender-hearted and loving. Otherwise, he is captured authentically, and for weeks before the fight he belittled Braddock publicly, until he read the relief story and realized the caliber of opponent he was about to face.<br/><br/>Also reproduced authentically are the fights. Ron Howard took great care, not only to tell the story accurately, which he did, but to choreograph the fights according to how they really went. I have the Baer-Carnera and Baer-Braddock fights on DVD, and Howard reproduced them very accurately, including the fouls Baer committed during the fight (three rounds were taken away from Baer for low blows and back-handing, and he back-handed other fighters as well, including Max Schmeling). And, in some of his fights, you can see him bowing and waving to his opponent at the end of a round as he did in the film.<br/><br/>I am a fan of authentically accurate films, something Hollywood has produced far more of in the last three decades; and this is the most authentic I have ever seen. It is wonderfully written, beautifully directed, and superlatively acted. And, it's a true story.<br/><br/>Do not miss it."

The interaction between Crowe (boxer Braddock) and Giamatti (his manager) is especially delightful. The love, warmth and devotion shown in the Braddock family is inspiring.<br/><br/>I took my mother to see the movie. I warned her it was about boxing and had some violent scenes in it. ""Sure, I know Jim Braddock, we used to listen to the fights on the radio when we were kids."" She remembered the Baer-Braddock and Baer-Carnera fights. My mother! After the movie she started talking about her childhood, which she has always been reluctant to do, and some of the hardships her family had. She remembered all the men out of work on the streets and many calling at the door looking for any kind of work. I got a better understanding of how difficult it really was and a better appreciation of her. She called me later to tell me how much she liked the movie and how much it meant to her.<br/><br/>An excellent movie which I highly recommend, even if you think you won't like a boxing movie.

","I'm sorry, but I find it completely ridiculous that people push aside and insult any movie dealing with boxing because they claim it is a remake of Rocky. I often hear people complain about how Maggie Fitzgerald from Million Dollar Baby was made out to be a fem-Rocky Balboa, and, despite how ridiculous it seems, even how Jake La Motta's life was depicted incorrectly in Raging Bull to make him emulate the desperate lifestyle of Balboa. I mean, come on! There's no doubt in my mind that Cinderella Man has proved to be one of the most entertaining and most inspirational movies of our time. Maybe it's just that people like to complain, or that they've naturally associated any and every boxing movie following the latest of the Rocky franchise with weak imitation and unoriginality, or maybe their opinions are focused too much on the way that the pessimistic critics of big-time newspapers tend to find something horribly wrong with every movie ever brought into existence. Okay, I'm through with my rant now. Besides, another unarguable point (which many individuals have brought up before)is that Cinderella Man is in fact based on the life of James Braddock. They lived during the Depression and people actually did live like Braddock and his family did in the movie. He actually was an underdog who was forced to fight in order to provide food for his family, even after he was supposedly retired and past his prime. And there actually was a heavy-hitting machine of a world champion named Max Baer who Braddock had to step into the ring with... okay I'm done with my rant now. :)"

Ron Howard crafted a masterpiece when he blended the colors, the feels, the emotions of the Depression and then wrapped everything in the warmth and humanity of Jim Braddock.

I imagined sweatshop workers in the 20's and late 30's, inhumane conditions, children dying ...<br/><br/>Actually, in certain moments it seemed to be some sort of slapstick comedy.

I enjoyed this film from start to finish, it was clearly a Ron Howard film, only the best. I highly recommend this movie, it is simply amazing. Russell Crowe is simply the best actor in Hollywood, his role in this film is so believable, it is like you see yourself as him.

"kanerazor","6","3","6","11 June 2005"," Disappointingly routine sports biopic
","While I enjoyed this movie very much watching it, it's resonated with me so little I'd tell anyone who asks that it's just okay. I'd give it a slight recommendation, but only as a period piece, b/c it does a somewhat moving job recapturing the feel of the Great Depression. The characters are so flat I felt like I never even met them. The hero is just a complete saint and the villain so evil he brags about the fact that he killed an opponent. And of course, the hero must win so that he can keep his angelic family together and happy. When they pile stuff on like that, of course it's completely obvious what's gonna happen.<br/><br/>Perhaps some more focus on Braddock's career would have established him as an underdog much better. As it is, we see his early great days, then jump ahead to the depression where we see how much pain his family's in, and when he decides to box again it's mentioned in passing how his career went downhill after one fight. We do see a fight where he does poorly, but that's not enough. The championship match is apparently the greatest upset in boxing history, and I wasn't getting that vibe at all.<br/><br/>Perhaps some more focus on the depression would have been better. Paddy Considine had a memorable supporting character, but he's barely there. I think some newsreel clips or some more stuff in the ""Hoovervilles"" would have been great. The tagline says Braddock brought America to its feet when it was on its knees, so maybe if I got a better sense of how on its knees the country was the victory would have been much more inspiring. As it is almost everything is about Braddock and his wife, and they have such great hearts that of course they can't wind up unhappy! Maybe it would have been better if they gave the wife part to a character actress, instead of Renee Zellwegger who'd insist on hogging screen time. Oh excuse me, ACADEMY AWARD WINNER RENEE ZELWEGGER! Of course I'm biased b/c I can't stand her, so even though I love Russell Crowe I definitely didn't care about the family's togetherness.<br/><br/>Perhaps some more focus on the opponent Max Baer would have been great. I heard the new book about the fight by Jeremy Schaap focuses on both fighters, and that sounds like an interesting read. Apparently Baer spent the rest of his life remorseful about the fighter he killed, and he was one of the most popular champions ever. In the movie he's such a monster I couldn't take him seriously-the character was out of place in a drama as serious in tone as this one. I at least liked the goofy charm Craig Bierko brought to the part, in what I hope's a star making performance. Baer seemed kind of like a dopey monster as played by him-he actually reminded me of Biff in Back to the Future. Again, not a serious threat, but the only character who I thought brought some life to the proceedings. Paul Giamatti's one of my favorite actors, but I just thought he was given a typical gruff trainer role to work with here.<br/><br/>The movie's been mentioned as the first serious Oscar contender of the year, but I think the only areas where it deserves consideration are art decoration and cinematography."

","From this point forward, Ron Howard should be allowed only to direct period-piece biopics starring Russell Crowe and an Oscar-caliber Hollywood sweetheart as Crowe's supportive wife. Just as this acting-directing duo did with their award-winning ""Beautiful Mind"" audiences are again treated to a true story of triumph over adversity played up with sepia-toned cinematography, lovely attention to period detail, and a swelling music score.<br/><br/>There's just something about Ron Howard's hackneyed mediocre directing style that allows for Russell Crowe's scenery chewing chameleon-like performances to shine at their brightest. He is the greatest actor of this generation, and here there is not one false note in his portrayal of scrappy under-dog boxer James Braddock, who went from the bread lines to the ring during the Great Depression and brought a nation on their knees back to their feet (or so the producers would like us to believe in their fairy-tale story). Likewise, Renee Zelwegger, like Jennifer Connolly before her, is pitch-perfect at Braddock's lovely wife, Mae. Please, Hollywood, from here on out let's cast Zelwegger only in movies taking place in the 1920's and 1930's. Just like in ""Chicago"" she looks perfect in the part, as if she was born in that era. The rest of the supporting cast (especially Giamatti as Braddock's tongue-lashing manager) is top notch.<br/><br/>Howard leaves no cliché unturned and no heart-string unplucked (cute kids getting sick in the cold or shedding a tear at a father's promise, a boxing opponent of pure swagger and spite, a grieving widow finding hope in cheering for Braddock, cynical reporters and other rich-people type becoming overwhelmed by Braddock's show of heart). As predictable as it all was, it was still nicely uplifting, and proof positive this is the only type of movie Howard should touch, and Crowe the only star he should ever work with. Bravo, fellas, you've done it again in spite of yourselves."

","Fantastic movie! Well paced, well written and wonderfully acted. I never knew too much of James Braddock other than he was a depression-era heavywieght. If this is truly his story, I'm surprised he isn't as well known. This was a truly an amazing story of courage and love. Giamatti will surely get a nomination and should win. Crowe was perfect in this film. He was tough, sympathetic and a great father figure. The boxing scenes seemed very realistic and the way injuries were portrayed were very inventive. Zellwegger was just great playing the devoted wife and mother. If your a fan of the common man making good this is for you. I think this movie will speak to the common man in us all.

","I'm not going to say this is a perfect film in terms of story structure or character but it is just the kind of film that people need sometimes to remind them that the best things in life are worth fighting for. This is a film that has it's heart in the right place. Russell Crowe paints a portrait of a man that inspired because he is the kind of man that no one sees anymore. So what if the film makes legendary champ Max Baer out to be a cookie-cutter villain? That's not the point. This film's point is to remind us that with enough determination one man can accomplish anything and that all life's hardships do is make us stronger for having faced them and in the case of Braddock, overcome them.

","Even if we ignore the mawkish sentimentality of the Depression-era scenes, intended to produce sympathy for the Braddocks but inducing only pain in the audience, the film would have benefited from a ""based on"" disclaimer. It is untrue to the history it depicts. Corn Griffin was not a top contender when Braddock fought him. Braddock had been knocked out, by Lou Scozza in Nov. '32. (On checking, I find the Scozza fight was a TKO, resulting from Braddock's cut eye, so the film gets by on that point). Refs did not say ""Touch gloves."" They said, ""Shake hands."" Body punches were not said to ""pay dividends"" (as we are twice told). And refs did not wipe off the gloves of the man knocked down. They directed the man who had scored the knockout to a neutral corner (after the ""Long Count"") and made sure the other man was up before he could be hit again. In other words, the film pulls a lot of current jargon and practice into the 1930s, making it painfully anachronistic. The treatment of Max Baer is inexcusable. He had killed Frankie Campbell, brother of great Dodgers' first-baseman, Dolph Camilli, but Ernie Schaaf (another Jersey boy) died almost six months after his fight with Baer and after 4 more fights -- after being kayoed by Primo Carnera in 13. Baer took Braddock lightly, did not train for the 1935 fight, and clowned around during the fight, waving to his bimbos at ring side. Braddock did pound out a decision, but the fight was not the brutal brawl depicted in the film. Nor -- though I am open to correction on this point -- did Baer deliberately foul Braddock with two low blows and a vicious backhand. It is unfortunate that Ron Howard took a compelling story about a decent and hard-working man, Jimmy Braddock, and ""Hollywoodized"" it by demonizing Maxie Baer. The film ends before the fight with Joe Louis. Louis said that the right hand with which he knocked Braddock out was the hardest punch he ever threw. Braddock sagged like one of those sacks he had been hauling on the Hoboken docks. The great film about those docks, of course, is ""On the Waterfront,"" which features three fighters whom Louis knocked out: Tony Galento, Abe Simon, and Tami Mauriello. ""Cinderella Man"" resembles ""Rocky,"" of course, but the fight scenes are better in the former. Not as good as ""Champion,"" though, where the shots were reversed, so that a slow punch and a quick withdrawal of the glove looked like the opposite. The movie is Crowecentric, which is good. He is completely convincing as Braddock, particularly in his expert work with the fast bag. It is unfortunate that the history in which he is placed is so patently phony. I just watched the film of Braddock-Baer. It was a clean fight. Baer was warned for shoving Braddock in the 4th. Braddock butted Baer in the 7th -- but it was a product of a shorter man who kept his head down. Braddock delivered a light backhand to Baer in the 11th. Baer complained in mock anger about Braddock's hitting on the break in the 12th. At times Baer held his open left hand out in Braddock's face -- illegal, but hardly the blatant fouling shown in the film. At the end, Baer kissed Braddock on the right cheek. After the decision, Braddock ran across the ring and the two fighters embraced. You can't judge a fight by a film, but it was closer than Charley Lynch's 11-4. Ref Johnny McEvoy had it 9-5-1, and George Kelly had it 7-7-1, with Braddock winning on the supplementary point system that New York had in place at that time. Kelly's verdict looked accurate. Braddock landed some good rights over Baer's low left. Baer hit Braddock with some great right hands, but Braddock almost invariably fought back. Had Baer used a left jab more often he would have dominated. He had a left jab -- not a good one -- but he simply did not set up his right hand with his left often enough vs Braddock. Braddock fought a gritty, gutsy fight. Baer did backhand Max Schmeling in the '33 fight before Baer knocked Schmeling out. The film of that fight does not show any warning from the ref to Baer, though it might have been delivered verbally. Perhaps the critic who claims that Baer repeatedly fouled Braddock is thinking of the earlier fight."

","Ron Howard has carved a niche for himself as creator of treacly populist hokum, and it seems pointless to criticize his movies again and again for being maudlin, manipulative and pandering. To his credit, he knows how to put a movie together, and by now everyone should know what to expect from a Howard film and not complain when that's exactly what they get.<br/><br/>For the first two-thirds of ""Cinderella Man,"" Howard appears to be bucking his own trend. It's quite respectable, fairly reserved and well acted. O.k., so Howard's version of Depression-era America still looks as glossy as a home decorating magazine, but I'll let that go. Russell Crowe is an actor who can make any movie better than it has any right to be, and Renee Zellweger is nowhere nearly as squinty and mealy as I thought she would be playing this character. And then we entered the final third of the film, and....Oh my. Watch out ""Seabiscuit,"" there's another huge piece of corn coming up fast on your tail.<br/><br/>In case you're not sure which boxer you should be rooting for in this movie, we get lots of closeup shots of big-eyed kids looking pleadingly at Russell Crowe like a bunch of little Oliver Twists. We get a scene in a church on the night of the big obligatory show-down match that all boxing movies must have, in which every pew is filled with people praying for Jim Braddock to win his fight, and we get a priest delivering the following subtle line to wife Renee Zellweger: ""In a way, he's (Braddock) fighting for them (the lowly downtrodden)."" If you're still not sure who to root for, Braddock's arch nemesis, Max Baer (played campily by Craig Bierko), makes lewd comments about Braddock's wife in a nightclub a few weeks before the match. And in the ring, he continues to make nasty comments in between slow-mo shots of him leering like a sadistic psycho. And if you're STILL not sure who to root for, Baer punches Braddock in the balls a couple of times during their match for good measure. Not since Rocky Balboa faced off against Drago (or whatever that big heap of Russian was called in ""Rocky IV""--or was it ""V?"") has a more cartoonish boxing villain stepped foot in a make-believe ring.<br/><br/>There's some scary talk here and there about Braddock possibly dying during the big fight, because he's old and past his prime. But since his kids are listening to the fight at home, and since this is a Ron Howard movie, we're pretty sure that he's not going to die. In fact, we're pretty sure he's probably going to win, or there would be no purpose for the film's existence. Howard dutifully connects all the dots, stealing from every other boxing movie ever made, throwing in lots of rapid-fire editing and thundering sound effects to make the fight scenes exciting.<br/><br/>It's sad and yet typical that Paul Giamatti, who gave two of the greatest film performances in the last few years (""American Splendor"" and ""Sideways"") would only be recognized by the mainstream Hollywood constituency for the hammy, dreadful role he's saddled with here. I only hope he was given a hefty paycheck to offset all the scenery he was forced to chew as Joe Gould, Braddock's wise-cracking manager.<br/><br/>It figures that in a year that gave us hard-hitting film after hard-hitting film that took critical and thought-provoking looks at current trends in American culture, Ron Howard would deliver a product as sanitized, safe and bland as this piece of instantly forgettable ""entertainment."" It looks good and has a solid performance from Crowe--I can't recommend it for any other reasons.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

Renée Zellweger was decent in it but again it wasn't a performance worthy of any gratuitous attention. There are many bad shots in the movie, and they need to work on their lighting and sound skills. For such a Hollywoodized production you'd think they wouldn't mix shots of light and darkness for one scene (one in particular, when they were outside of the church) and the sound wouldn't crackle so much but maybe that is a theater problem.

","When Americans are unemployed, they put even more out of work to make this movie. The highly publicized film ""Cinderella Man"" opened June 3. It is a classic American story in every way, with one exception: where it was made. It was filmed in Toronto instead of the United States, using labor heavily subsidized by the Canadian government. How ironic that this story of a man literally fighting to provide for his family at the height of the Depression should be filmed in a foreign country, costing America hundreds of middle-class jobs and contributing to the dangerous trade imbalance which now deeply concerns our economic experts. <br/><br/>James J. Braddock, the ""Cinderella Man,"" was born in New York City to Irish immigrant parents. His is a real-life ""Rocky"" story. He was a poor local boxer struggling to support his family when, fighting as a ten-to-one underdog, he defeated Max Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world in 1935. Seventy years later, the crowds cheering him on to victory in the film about his life are no longer Americans because the background artists portraying them are Canadians, as is the overwhelming majority of people employed in the making of this movie. Material that should be triumphantly American is counterfeit, a cheap and tawdry imitation of who we are. <br/><br/>In recent years millions of American jobs have been outsourced overseas to take advantage of lower labor rates. However, Canada and Australia, where ""Superman"" is now being filmed, are hardly third world nations. Unlike other industries, in the case of film and television production labor costs are made artificially lower in these and other countries by government subsidies which violate our trade agreements. <br/><br/>When 28 members of Congress sent a letter of protest over the choice to film James Braddock's story in Canada, the studios which produced ""Cinderella Man"" claimed they went to Toronto because it was the only place that had the right architecture. That's a lame excuse for a purely monetary decision. Plenty of cities in the United States still have buildings with the historically correct ""look"" for this picture. The studios went to Canada because one third of their labor costs were kicked back by the government, pure and simple. <br/><br/>The outsourcing of this and other productions in order to take advantage of illegal subsidies offered by foreign governments is more than just a moral and patriotic outrage. It doesn't only cost American jobs. It is also a very real threat to the economic stability of the United States. The filming of American movies and TV shows in foreign countries contributes to our ballooning trade deficit and the devaluation of our dollar against other currencies. As a result, outsourced production harms every single American citizen in a very real way."

Braddock, in 1934, had upset wins against Corn Griffin and John Henry Lewis.

Jim was a 10 to 1 underdog, but traded punches with the bigger Baer and won the championship. Two years later, Braddock lost the crown by a KO delivered by Joe Louis. Jim Braddock gave a down-trodden populace a hero to look up to and was bestowed the nickname of the Cinderella Man. Other cast members: Renee Zellweger as J.J.'s wife Mae along with Bruce McGill, David Huband and Paddy Considine. Once again director Howard evokes excellence providing some very realistic and graphic boxing scenes. He also found bit parts for his dad Rance and brother Clint.

","Cinderella Man is a guaranteed hit at least with critics although I don't know that I heard all that much of it. Regardless it has an amazing combination and a story to back all of that up. Academy darling Russell Crowe, regardless of all the outside personal stuff is hands down a great actor. He has a quiet intensity about him and he brings his style to James Braddock perfectly. Braddock is a deeply loving family man bent on survival and keeping his family together. But on top of that he's a man who boxes, he's a legend and it's all he knows how to do and Crowe performs this role flawlessly. It's a beautiful performance. Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors. Not only does he manage to make critically acclaimed films but he makes it films that the audience loves. Cinderella Man is no different. He's created a story that is gritty and visual, gray and depressing but pulls a heart warming powerful underdog story out of it that will make you jump up and root for James Braddock.<br/><br/>The setting for Cinderella Man is depression era New York and the way that this film is set up will make you feel the depression into your very bones. Sometimes the sets almost look like a stage with a single spot light onto it and instead of cheapening the look, it makes it feel desolate, poor, discouraging and you feel the emotions of all the actors. Renée Zellweger is okay. She kind of sticks out from the rest of the cast because she doesn't really ever reach the caliber of performance that the others do especially the one she shares the most screen time with...Crowe. Paul Giamatti continues his streak of great roles as Braddock's best friend, corner man and supporter Joe Gould. Although the character is a small role he puts real heart into it and is bound for a best supporting actor nomination for sure. The rest of the supporting cast will be familiar faces, great character actors and they all fit the bill. One of my favorite faces who shows up here and there and always turns out a great performance no matter how brief is Bruce McGill who, in Cinderella Man, plays fight promoter Jimmy Johnston. <br/><br/>Despite all the impressive very real performances they only help what is a brilliant moving story. Boxing stories on film always seem to hit a note with emotions ie: Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and this film really felt like the common Rocky formula but was far more real than the Italian Stallion. The story was so uplifting and you get so drawn in and the action is great too considering the intense boxing fights especially the final bout against the heavy weight champion. But you never consider it a violent story about boxing but rather one man's return and rise above poverty to save his family and regain his dignity. I don't think there isn't anyone that won't enjoy this captivating film about a boxer who was the hope for thousands. Check this one out for sure!! 9/10"

"Monotreme02","8","2","4","27 October 2005"," A truly wonderful film, unfairly overlooked
","Ron Howard is an interesting director, because that there's nothing interesting about him at all. He doesn't wear all black and make spooky Gothic movies; he doesn't wear thick-rimmed glasses, talk nervously and make movies about himself; he doesn't have three names. He is just a regular person who makes totally regular movies. The thing is, he makes GOOD regular movies. They don't have anything particularly special or unique about them, but they're just good all around. It was true with 'Willow', it was true with 'Apollo 13', and it was true with 'A Beautiful Mind'. Now, it's true with 'Cinderella Man'. And this isn't a bad thing at all  on the contrary.<br/><br/>Jim Braddock's character is masterfully constructed. Not in a very long time has anybody played such a downright nice man as Jim Braddock. Despite the poverty, the hopelessness, and his losing fights during the Great Depression, Braddock always remains levelheaded, sweet-tempered and concerned about his family above all. I can't recall one boxing movie in which the boxer wasn't a mean, grumpy man (Raging Bull) or single and tough ('Rocky'). This is the only boxing movie I know in which the boxer is a sweet, loving family man, married and with children nonetheless.<br/><br/>The acting is superb all around, and I couldn't expect less of the performers involved. Russell Crowe ('Gladiator', 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Master & Commander'), while unpredictable and hard to control, is still, I believe, one of the most talented actors working today. His performance in this film is beyond sensational. It's not just in the dramatic moments: it's also the little nuances he includes in his performance, such as in the scene in which he returns to his old boxing bosses and asks them for money to help him pay the electric bill. The look of humiliation and humbleness in his eyes when he walks into that room is priceless. Renee Zelwegger ('Bridget Jones's Diary', 'Chicago', 'Cold Mountain'), another one of my favorite working actresses, also delivers a strong and brilliant performance. She plays Braddock's wife, Mae. Paul Giamatti truly stands out, though, as Joe Gould, Braddock's manager. I believe that Giamatti, a rising lead actor in recent films 'American Splendor' and 'Sideways', is one of the more underrated actors in Hollywood today. His acting is esteemed by critics, but is shunned by his peers in Hollywood. Perhaps his performance in Cinderella Man will finally get him the Oscar nomination he deserved for American Splendor and Sideways.<br/><br/>The editing is outstanding. The fights are particularly well edited. The pace is fast, but the editing isn't quick, or rushed. It really pulls you right into the fight, though, and totally engages you. The cinematography, too, is impressive, especially during the boxing scenes. The inter-cutting of point-of-view shots with subjective shots of the two boxers is executed excellently. The cuts occur at just the right times, and the overall effect really lets you feel the adrenaline of the fight.<br/><br/>Like most boxing movies (Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby, at least), Cinderella Man isn't even about the boxing. In fact, for most of the middle part of the movie there is no boxing at all: instead, the film portrays how Braddock, his wife, Mae, and their three kids, struggle to survive in the poverty of the Great Depression. The story of a family in the midst of the Great Depression is as compelling as the boxing story. Braddock portrays a much-needed role model, devoted first and foremost to his family. The historical and socio-economic background was powerfully shown and greatly added to the audience's involvement and is particularly relevant to today.<br/><br/>But the audience's involvement reaches a peak during the boxing scenes. A combination of identification with Braddock's sympathetic character, masterful directing and flawless editing and cinematography make the boxing scenes, especially the final one, heart pounding, compelling and totally gripping. My heart jumped with every swing, and my grip on the seat handle tightened with every punch. When the audience becomes SO involved with what occurs on the screen, that's the single most prominent sign of good film-making.<br/><br/>Of course, the more minor technical aspects of the film are perfect. You couldn't expect less of a period film, really, but it's still an aspect to note: The costumes, sets, production design, lighting, even the props are all top-notch.<br/><br/>The film tries its best to avoid clichés, but in some instances, it's hard to do so. It's a regular riches-to rags-to riches story, and the boxing scenes also don't have anything ground-breaking and different about them, but you have to remember that this is a biographical film, and the events that occur in it are all true. Sure, the riches-to rags-to riches story in the film does seem a little far-fetched, but this was the true story of Jim Braddock, and so all clichés in the film are forgiven.<br/><br/>Unfortunately and disappointingly, Cinderella Man was not a success in North America, even though it has all the signs to be a real winning and successful movie. Although the movie received very good reviews from critics and audiences, it faired relatively poorly at the box office. Perhaps it was the timing, as these ""Oscar"" movies are usually released in November and December, and not in June, when Cinderella Man was released in North America. Moviegoers look for summer blockbusters in June, and not dramas such as this one. Or perhaps Russell Crowe's hotel phone-throwing fiasco turned audiences off. Whatever the reason, I hope the movie's DVD release will incite a new interest in it, just in time for the Oscars.<br/><br/>This is a truly wonderful film, unfairly overlooked, and I hope will impress some Oscar voters. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."

It's a boxing story, a biography and a period piece as well as a love story of sorts.Now, that is not to say that the fisticuffs of the film were sub standard in any way. Both the demonstration of the ""Sweet Science"" by the individual actors and the recreation of historical bouts from the depression era are all top notch. <br/><br/>To start with it is based on the true story of one James J.Braddock who was a sort of Journeyman Light Heavyweight Boxer in the 1920's. Braddock had to give up his pugilistic career due to some recurring injury to his hand. Some time later, he gets back into the game and works his way up to the Heavyweight Crown. This is all common knowledge to most any sports fan.<br/><br/>The film is also a great biopic in that it has been said to capture the essence of the real man. At times the character seems almost too good to be true. But those who knew him have insisted that the real man was as portrayed.<br/><br/>As a ""Love Story"", well love is all portrayed all throughout this story. We see the love and devotion of a man and woman to each other and to their family.The love of the children for their folks when the financial condition of the country and the whole world is at its very worst.And finally, the love of a public for a true champion for them to revere.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film was a period piece. It paints a very good picture of the depression years and what it was (and still is) like to be among the working poor. Mr.Braddock was representative of that generation of people who bravely fought their way through the Great Depression, only to immediately face the dangers and come out victorous in World War II."

No wonder Tom Brokaw called them the ""Greatest Generation""."

","My wife and I hate boxing, but this movie is so good even boxing haters should be able to tolerate the punching. No question, one of the best movies we have seen in a long time. Russell Crowe did an absolutely amazing job, very convincing in the part. He is one of the finest actors of our time.<br/><br/>I can see Cinderlla hasn't done too well in the box office, so I'm hoping for an Acadamy Award to boost the interest. Its too bad if people are put off by the boxing, this is a movie you don't want to pass up. Two thumbs major up.<br/><br/>Checked out www.jamesjbraddock.com, a web site created by Braddocks relatives. From what I can tell, the movie was historically accurate. At the end of the movie, before the credits, there are some postscript notes about Braddock and his family. But there is much more information about him on the web site if you are interested."
"anhedonia","5","2","4","10 June 2005"," Hackiva Goldsman strikes again
","How on earth does Akiva Goldsman continue to get work as a screenwriter in Hollywood? The man's a hack, responsible for such unforgettable masterpieces as ""Silent Fall"" (1994), ""Batman Forever"" (1995), ""Batman and Robin"" (1997), ""Lost in Space"" (1998), ""Practical Magic"" (1998) and ""I, Robot"" (2004). When you watch such tripe, what can one say but Akiva Goldsman! Yes, he won an Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind"" (2001), when Academy voters went completely bonkers and decided to honor claptrap over quality.<br/><br/>I wonder how much of what Cliff Hollingsworth wrote made it into the shooting script. Because this film has all the trademarks of yet another hackneyed job by Goldsman. He doesn't have a clue how to find grey areas in his characters. They're either good or bad. That's it. He hasn't seen a cinematic cliché he doesn't embrace. That's what's wrong with Ron Howard's film, ""Cinderella Man."" Apparently, boxer James J. Braddock's life was nothing but a series of clichés. That this film remains partially interesting is due to Russell Crowe's uncanny ability to disappear into a character and Paul Giamatti's sensationally terrific performance as Braddock's trainer, Joe Gould. Renée Zellweger gets a poorly written role as Braddock's long-suffering wife.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" is the ideal film for the George W. Bush administration. It's shamelessly manipulative, alters reality to suit its needs and comes with such jingoistic fervor that you feel like a pariah for not liking it. Not liking this film could be downright un-American. And, as we all know, these days, being called unpatriotic is worse than being called a pedophile.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" is the kind of film so seeped in its own sense of righteous goodness that it seems destined to be embraced by Academy voters next year. At least, that could very well result in Giamatti finally getting an Oscar nomination, something he was shamefully denied for his performances in ""American Splendor"" (2003) and ""Sideways"" (2004).<br/><br/>In this film, Braddock doesn't just pull himself up by his bootstraps. The guy's too poor to own boots. So he pulls himself up on borrowed bootstraps! I've no doubt the real Braddock was a decent chap who boxed to save his family from dire straits. But I doubt he was as uncomplex a person as Goldsman made him. Also, Max Baer wasn't the ogre Howard and Goldsman make him out to be. In this film, Baer (Craig Bierko) is an obnoxious, insensitive, womanizing brute who gloats about killing two men in the ring.<br/><br/>There've been some great boxing films throughout history, including ""Body and Soul"" (1947), ""The Set-Up"" (1949), ""Fat City"" (1972) and Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, ""Raging Bull"" (1980). ""Cinderella Man"" isn't one of them. Though, there were times during Howard's film when I was convinced I was watching Scorsese's movie. Not because ""Cinderella Man"" rekindled the brilliance, but because Howard clearly borrowed so heavily from ""Raging Bull"" for his boxing sequences.<br/><br/>Incidentally, while much of the art direction capturing the Great Depression is impressive, what happened when it came to recreating Braddock's ramshackle apartment? Quite frankly, it looked like the set of an amateur theatrical production, and a bad one at that.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" could've been a trenchant, powerful, gritty film about an honorable man's fight to remain true to himself and his family and his struggle to overcome great adversity. But every momentous occasion - and this film's riddled with them - is telegraphed so broadly and blatantly that it's difficult to be wowed by any of it. You know promises will be broken, ""important"" scenes of families coming apart will be shown, flashbacks to hammer home sledgehammer-like what Braddock is fighting for will pop up at the right moments. Goldsman even goes so far as to have a pre-fight meeting between Baer and Braddock where, you guessed it, one guy will be positively rotten and the other charming and humble.<br/><br/>Just think what a genuinely good and talented writer could have done with this story."

","Those who criticize Cinderella Man are the same who criticize Finding Neverland. They have the same, tired argument: Cinderella Man doesn't represent the truth; Finding Neverland doesn't represent the truth! What these people don't quite seem to grasp is that neither of these movies (make that NO movie) owes us the complete truth. Cinderella Man isn't a documentary. If Braddock needs to be made out as a bigger hero than he really was -- and if Baer needs to be made out as a bigger villain than he really was -- then so be it.<br/><br/>I didn't go to the theater to watch a 3 hour history lesson -- I went to be entertained. I went to be inspired. I went to be moved. I went to laugh. Cinderella Man succeeds in all these areas and more.<br/><br/>Although the fight scenes were the best I have ever seen, this isn't a boxing movie -- my wife loved it just as much as I did. This is a story of love, determination and will-power. This movie is an all-too-rare thing: a reason to go to the theater. 10/10!"

The fight sequences are grueling and realistic, and the story is authentic Great Depression realism.<br/><br/>This movie really approaches the problems of the Depression unflinchingly, and shows what the lack of income can do to a family, and a family's security.

","Russell Crowe's performance is awesome. This movie makes you realize how people struggled during the great depression. His wife doesn't like for him to box because of the risks involved, but he realizes it's the only way to take care of his family. The story is wonderful, based on the true life story of James J. Braddock. In the beginning he is a contender for the world heavyweight championship, but then he loses his license to box due to a few bad performances. He struggles to feed his family and pay his bills. A once well to do family now is dependent on welfare and Braddock even has to beg to pay his bills. After not having boxed for for a few years he has an opportunity to fight again because the number two world heavy weight contender has an upcoming fight and his opponent pulls out of the fight and no one is willing to fight him. His ex-manager comes to see him and asks him if he wants the fight which pays $250.00. He jumps at the opportunity because of his financial situation. I enjoyed the movie and I would see it again. The movie is definitely worth the price of admission. Very realistic and believable. My compliments to Ron Howard aka Richie Cunningham and Opie Taylor.<br/><br/>Enjoy, Eddie"

And even more wonderful are all the little moments with Braddock and his children, or Braddock and his manager (played brilliantly by Paul Giamatti), Russell Crowe is so compelling, touching, funny, and true to his character -- the movie rests on his shoulders, and he delivers on all levels.<br/><br/>Ron Howard tells a powerful story in this film, and he does it from the inside out. Whether its showing the ravages of the Great Depression, or a sexy moment between Mr. & Mrs. Braddock, or the transition from living the middle class dream to living in a basement hovel, or all the powerful and distinct boxing matches -- Howard guides the audience through the heart of feeling each moment masterfully.<br/><br/>I'm only sorry I can't see it again for the first time!

Boxing legend Jim Braddock, having fought his way from rags to mediocrity in the ring is hardly able to provide for his family during the horrible depths of the Great Depression.

An incredible feat of creativity gets you to follow the fight's connecting punches all the way to their impact on the cheering crowds. You are there  in the ring as well as in the audience!

A fortunate string of events leads to Braddock's being given a second chance, although his wife is reluctant to subject him to such brutality once again. I don't want to take away from the experience by giving away any more of the plot, but anyone who is familiar with Braddock's story knows this will be a phenomenal film. Ron Howard simultaneously captures the brutality of Braddock's fights and his gentle nature.

","Cinderella Man is the story of James J. Braddock, played by Russell Crowe, who is an upcoming boxer that goes from riches to rags, and then back to riches.  Braddock's wife Mae Braddock, played by Renee Zellweger, does not like that Braddock fights.  The couple experiences many ups and downs throughout the movie.  Right before the Great Depression started Braddock was winning fights and able to support his family financially.  Then with a bad streak of luck, the Depression hits and Braddock starts losing fight after fight.  After losing many fights, the boxing commission kicks Braddock out and tells him he is no longer allowed to fight.  With no way to pay the bills, and a broken hand, Braddock goes to the docks to try to earn some money.  Things continue to go south for the Braddock family.  They can not afford to keep the lights on, get milk, and do not have enough money to feed their children.  Mae sends the children away to live with her family without talking to her husband.  Braddock has to suck up his pride and go to the same boxing commission that told him he was no longer able to fight and asked them for money so he could get his electricity turned back on.  Finally, things started to turn around when Braddock's manager Joe Gould, played by Paul Giamatti, is able to get Braddock a one-time fight.  To everyone's surprise, Braddock wins this fight, and the commission lets him back into league.  Fueled by the last several years of poverty, heartache, and passion Jim continues to win and becomes the number one contender, and eventually takes home the title of the world's heavy weight champion. The two main themes of the movie Cinderella Man were loyalty and to never give up on your dreams.  Braddock's manager, Gould, never gave up on Braddock.  He was able to get him another fight and sold his furniture to help finance Braddock's comeback. Gould had Braddock's back throughout his entire career. If Braddock would have given up boxing he would have never been the world's heavy weight champion.      It appears that Cinderella Man and Rocky are very closed related.  Both movies have main characters that symbolize strength and courage.  They are both the struggling underdogs in a one time fight and end up winning their fight.  By winning the fight, they were able to change their lives.  Rocky and Braddock also had the support of the people on their side.  The film's director Ron Howard, uses several extreme close-ups during the boxing scene.  During the close-ups of the fighters, we see the exhaustion from their faces.  Along with close-ups, slow motion is used to help emphasize the speed and the power of the punches.  As the film is based during the Depression years, the lighting is dark with very few bright colors.   During several of the fights, we are able to experience a subjective point of view.  This allows us to see the punch that is coming to hit Braddock. As Braddock showed us, you should never give up on your dreams even if things take a turn for the worst.  Continued dedication and hard work will eventually pay off."
"wysong-74530","7","0","0","23 April 2017"," Plot and Theme
","Cinderella Man starring Russell Crowe as James J. Braddock tells the story of Braddock's boxing life, and his riches to rags with a comeback to riches. His wife Renée Zellweger as Mae Braddock sticks by his side through it all even though she despises him boxing and risking injury. Paul Giamatti plays the role as Joe Gould who is James Braddock's manager. James was a successful boxer and lived a wealthy lifestyle for the late 1920's. He was a professional and boxing was his primary source of income. His time in the ring began to take a toll on his body, which is why Mae refused to watch him fight. <br/><br/>James was proud and refused to ask for pity or accept defeat. He had broken his right hand and struggled winning matches. He wasn't as strong with his left and began to lose more than win. Eventually, James wasn't providing the hype that promoters wanted for his fights, and they revoked his boxing commission. This layoff happened as our country entered the great depression, and finding work was hard. No matter the situation James faced, he fought for his family. The struggles of providing food and milk, paying the electric, or even having firewood for sufficient heat were stacking against him. James found work on a loading dock that never guaranteed daily employment but wasn't making enough to pay his dues. Mae had worried about their three children getting sick, and sent them to her sisters for temporary keeping. Sending his kids away for support had broken James down, and he eventually asked for help, from the government assistance and his former boxing pals who seemed to be living in success. Throughout the movie, James never stopped fighting for his family, and he struggled to find work and support them ever way he could. Through it, all James and Mae stick together. <br/><br/>The use of low key lighting throughout this movie built on the theme and helped the viewer feel the struggles of the Braddock family. The life struggles during the great depression lacked excitement and avoiding the use of vibrant lighting in the room was bright for the theme. Throughout the movie, the background sounds used to build on the scene and feel more than what we see I thought was unique. In a scene of Central Park where families lived in shacks, you hear the cries of people in the background of the scene shown. This same technique was also used in the fight scenes, and we heard the background of the radio announcers and crowds cheering while we watched the match. The theme is like the movie ""IP Man"" which has a man fighting for his family, either in a ring or at work. <br/><br/>James' manager, Joe, visits him to offer him a previous fight against a number two contender as a ""goodbye"" to Madison Square Garden. James accepts the fight for the cash offer, which didn't sit well with Mae. She visits Joe out of frustration of him profiting on James risking injury. She learns that Joe was also struggling during the hard times and only acted to living wealthy. The fight was not in James' favor, however, in a stunning defeat, James wins by a knockout. Slowly James has been offered new fights which he continued to win. He had claimed milk was his motivation for his success, which few people understood. James had gone on to winning the champion title against a brutal opponent. No matter his struggles in life, James fought for success to take care of what was most important to him."

","In the film Russell Crowe plays a boxer named James Braddock who is married to Mae Braddock who is played by Renee Zellweger. James is managed by Joe Gould who is played by Paul Giamatti. James is a promising young boxer. After injuries hinder his ability to fight lowers his performance no one will give him a fight. The great depression hits and takes a toll on James and his family. He is given a chance to fight one last time makes the most of it and works his way up the ladder to become the champion of his weight class. The rise does not come without its struggles and conflict within his family. <br/><br/>The theme of the film is that you must do whatever it takes to care for and be with your family. Throughout the film when James is fighting, when given his second chance, he has flashbacks to his family struggling. This gives the impression that he is fighting for his family and the betterment of them. He is determined that no matter what happens he will win the fight and he will do it for his family. <br/><br/>Another scene that demonstrates the theme is when his son is caught stealing. When he makes his son return the item he stole he promises him that he will never split their family apart. Many families had to be split apart because of the tough economic times. <br/><br/>The scene where James is working on the docks with a broken hand also demonstrates the theme. He is hiding his injury and working through a lot of pain to ensure that his family can stay together. He is determined that there is nothing that is going to keep him from doing whatever he can to keep his family together. <br/><br/>There were also thematic elements that played into the role of determining the theme. The lighting in the home helps to show the theme. The apartment they are staying in is dark except for the faces of the family members, which shows the importance of the family. It is also symbolic that there are no lights on in the house when the kids have to leave the home. <br/><br/>In addition to the lighting the angles in the film also show examples of the theme. When James is entering the ring the angle of the camera is above him. When he is in the ring there are angles that show him from a ringside perspective that gives the illusion he is high in the air. This shows that he is doing something that is helping his family and is being propped up for doing so. <br/><br/>The film Castaway has similar items to the theme of this film. In Castaway Chuck has a will to survive and stay alive because of his wife. This shows that it is imperative to do whatever it takes to care for and be with your family."

By 1929, after piling up an impressive record in over 40 professional bouts, he lands a title fight. However, what turns out to be worse for his fate than his loss to the champion Tommy Loughran, is the stock market crash later that year, which plunges the country into the Great Depression. Wiped out financially, Braddock and his family - wife Mae (Zellweger) and three kids – are relegated to a cramped basement apartment and he begins to support his family by finding occasional work as a longshoreman. His boxing license is also eventually revoked as our erstwhile champion loses fight after fight and he soon goes on welfare in order to subsist. Soon, his plight becomes a public source of shame, when his being on welfare gets reported in the local tabloids. Somehow summoning up a combination of grace, courage, and confidence in the face of humiliation, Braddock chooses to train again, this time as a heavyweight. When his former manager Joe Gould (Giamatti) gets him a lucrative break as dead-meat for a heavyweight challenger, it kick- starts one of the most remarkable career revivals in sporting history. Beating the odds again and again in a series of surprising upsets, he becomes a source of hope for the common American man by conquering the boxing world, while still struggling through the daily grind of poverty and gets christened as 'Cinderella Man'. With Braddock winning fights in convincing fashion, he is given a shot at the title held by the malicious Max Baer, a vicious fighter who has killed two men in the ring. Does he emerge victorious from this ominous fight, or does this turn out to be the night when the fairytale ends for our 'Cinderella Man'?<br/><br/>Ron Howard's Cinderella Man skillfully delivers a primal, heart- pounding satisfaction as he directs this rousing saga with an admirable sense of restraint, which works to underscore the resilience of characters and allows the actors and the story enough time to breathe. His presentation of the bout is dynamic and tense, not giving into histrionic display. He keeps a consistent, sharp tone throughout, not resorting to any overtly sappy moments which many films of this ilk have a tendency to do. Renee Zellweger rises to the challenge and delivers an earnest performance. A delightfully scene-stealing Paul Giamatti shows us the raw excitable emotions that keep breaking the surface of Gould's fast-talking tough-guy facade. But it is Russell Crowe who steals the show with his towering performance. He adopts a flawless period 'Noo-Yawk' accent, a tough guy attitude, and undergoes a physical transformation to look remarkably like Braddock. But he ensures that the character does not fall into these superficial accoutrements and carries the film forward with a kind of quiet dignity only he can.<br/><br/>As a true-grit tale of redemption, Cinderella Man lands one solid body punch after another!"

","If Ron Howard knows how to do anything, it's how to make a cinematic but bland movie. If I was watching this in 2005, then Cinderella Man would feel like shameless Oscar bait, but one that would be a little worthy. Unlike most baity films like this, people really love Ron Howard's stuff, though this film didn't do too well at the box office at the time. With a good A-list cast and a decent true story, it's not fluff that just flutters into its the mess of its year. It can at least hold onto another 10 years. With a blend of depression-era domestic struggles and adrenaline- pumping fighting, it tries to tick boxes for everything and relatively succeeds in an involving way, if brazenly saccharine. But it fully embraces that and the conviction of the acting makes it work. I usually don't like Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. I usually love Paul Giamatti but I was unsure at first.<br/><br/>However, they all won me over by the end, especially Crowe who brought rare heart to his performance along with his natural visceral grit. Granted, the film is still quite derivative at times. It brings nothing new to the boxing ring, besides perhaps a small innovation of a way of shooting POV. It frequently uses the disorientating flash of the 1920s camera which it fails to justify. The film has nothing to do with media tension, only fleeting mentions of how things will look in the press. It's purely surface, not adding anything besides mood. The film doesn't really have any themes rather than perseverance and universal emotions. But it's fine as a piece of easy entertainment, though it would've been best off not villainizing its eventual antagonist in such a cartoonish way, especially as the portrayal was nothing like the actual boxer. Clunky execution of certain things aside, Cinderella Man is a good and somewhat poignant film.<br/><br/>7/10"

","An overall entertaining film about American boxer James J. Braddock, world heavyweight champion from 1935–37. A little melodramatic at times with interchangeable acting to go along, but ultimately a really good outing. Gordon Sim's set decoration and Daniel Orlandi's costume design fit the Great Depression-era tone perfectly, and Ron Howard's directing of the fight scenes create a wickedly superb realism that makes the audience feel like they're the ones giving and taking the punches. Neighbor DeWitt is the granddaughter of the real Braddock. Craig Bierko is incredibly interesting as challenger Max Baer, though Baer is portrayed as a harsher person than he was in real life.<br/><br/>***½ (out of four)"

","Cinderella Man is the film that i consider to be Ron Howard's best work since that of A Beautiful Mind, 2 film starring Russell Crowe with him giving 2 masterful performances. The movie tells the inspiring and emotionally moving story of James Braddock (played by Russell Crowe) a washed up boxer whose family became poor at the time of the great depression and tried so hard to make his family rich again. Ron Howard does it again but not only with his 2 film collaborations with Russell Crowe but making extraordinary films out of them both. This is a boxing movie that hasn't inspired me as much both Rocky, and Million Dollar Baby inspired me.Also not only Crowe gives an excellent performance but and besides Renee Zelweger as his wife, but is Paul Giamatti's great supporting performance that made the film even more inspiring. This is a film that should have been on all film critics lists as one off 2005's greatest films."

","I love how all the historians of boxing and the Great Depression and the haters just down play this movie like it's completely false. Are all the parts of this movie the absolute truth? Probably not. With that said, I believe Ron Howard was trying to capture the goodness and heart of the main character Jim Braddock, played by Russell Crowe. It's Hollywood folks and the truth can be slightly twisted to blown out of proportion in movies. I really enjoyed the movie and thought the boxing scenes were filmed perfectly. Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould was brilliant. I felt his character pieced the movie together. Now, if I am not mistaken, the real life Joe Gould had run ins with the law later on. In the movie they make him out to be a great guy and maybe he was. Some of the acting is a tad bit cheesy but not over bearing or unwatchable. I believe Ron Howard was just trying to capture the feel of someone living through the depression and what one person did to save his family and he did. If your stomach didn't have a little lump in it seeing how tough it was then you just didn't get it. Most of us here wouldn't understand. As far as Max Baer, he is painted as somewhat of a monster. My guess is he wasn't and was given that image as the ""bad guy"" for the movie. Overall, this movie is worth the watch and more than once. Great movie from Mr. Howard that leaves you feeling good when it's over."

","James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a successful up and coming fighter. By 1933, he is broken down and like the rest of the world impoverished. He can't pay his bills. His family is suffering. He struggles on with smaller fights, nagging injuries, and little work. Then they revoke his license to fight. He hits bottom. His kids are sent away. He goes on public assistance and ends up begging for money. His long time trainer Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) gets a short notice fight with the number 2 heavyweight contender but he surprised everybody by winning.<br/><br/>The one word for the Braddock character is dignity. He never lost his even as he hit rock bottom. It's a very compelling character, and Russell Crowe plays it perfectly. Both Renée Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are terrific in this. The fight action is well done and exciting. The best part of the movie is probably when the family is down to nothing. It's a superb movie from a great director with a compelling story."
"jimbo-53-186511","8","0","0","10 July 2013"," Excellent biographical film about one boxer's determination to succeed
","This was a truly wonderful film about the life of James J Braddock. The film begins in 1928 with Braddock (another great performance by Russell Crowe) at the height of his career, he is winning lots of fights and is earning an absolute fortune. We then move on 5 years to 1933 (the year of the Great Depression) and we now find that Braddock is at rock bottom - his spiral downwards started due to a high profile defeat that he suffered back in 1929 and due to a string of further defeats and constant injuries (his right hand causes him major problems) Braddock now finds himself 'disowned' by the Boxing commission and he's forced to try and get work down at the dock in order to try and provide for his wife Mae Braddock (Renee Zellweger) and his children. The problem is the work at the dock isn't guaranteed as only a select few people are chosen each day and as this is during the Great Depression many people are out of work so there are lots of people waiting at the gate for only a handful of jobs.<br/><br/>From this point onwards, we start to see Braddock slowly work his way back to the top. He initially has to work at the dock, but also takes on small 'low profile' matches for rather insignificant sums of money (which usually just about covers the rent and electric at his house). His big breakthrough comes when he is given the opportunity to fight the number 2 contender that evening by his trainer Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) due to his opponent having to step down due to injury and no other opponent is prepared to fight the number 2 contender at short notice without training.<br/><br/>As I've already mentioned, Russell Crowe's performance was very good and he has proved over the years that he is a talented and versatile actor. The supporting cast of Zellweger Considine and Giamatti were all excellent. The film also draws you in because Braddock is such a likable person, is caring towards others and is a real family man. Cinderella Man is also a roller coaster of emotions - there are moments that will make you smile, moments that will make you sad and moments that will make you cheer and that's what great film making is all about in my opinion.<br/><br/>The only (very minor) negative I could find in Cinderella Man is that I feel there could have been more training montages (as with Million Dollar Baby or Rocky for example).<br/><br/>Cinderella Man ultimately is an interesting biographical feature with some fantastic acting performances and should act as an inspiration to anyone that 'most things in life are achievable if you have the desire to succeed'. A truly brilliant work of art that I would recommend to everyone."

","With stunning directing, acting and historical accuracy, Cinderella Man is a biographical film worth the watch. Although the plot is clearly focused around boxing, what makes Cinderella Man so exceptional is the theme of the Great Depression, which spans the entire film. Supporting characters express different emotions toward the poverty they see every day, and the constant threat of eviction hovers over the Braddock family throughout the film. Watching the determination of the Braddocks to survive, along with the boxing plot, lends this movie the feel of a timeless classic. Whether or not boxing is their favorite sport, viewers will enjoy this movie for its breathtaking directing and acting, beautifully capturing on screen the will of one family to survive one of America's darkest hours.<br/><br/>bitesizemoviereviews.blogspot.com"
"bennicklin","8","0","0","12 April 2012"," Cinderella Man battling against Rocky?
","Cinderella Man is hard hitting boxing film set around the time of depression in 1930's America. I know what immediately comes to your mind, ""Rocky with a 1930's twist"" Well for today we will let Rocky have a day off so he can listen to the rest of the Survivor album which he seems to have failed to get through. Instead we're going to dabble through the true story of James Braddock (Russell Crowe) and see if Cinderella Man deserves to gain its own status and come out on top.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Ron Howard who has worked on successful productions such as Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. Howard has reunited with Russell Crowe from previous work on A Beautiful Mind (2001) and been partnered up with Renee Zellweger (Bridget Jones's Diary). The story follows the Braddock family of James (Crowe), Mae (Zellweger) and their three children in the time of The Great Depression in America. James, better known as Jimmy in the film, has an up and down boxing career which causes problems for him and his family throughout the narrative.<br/><br/>So here's a question for you, how does a marriage between the once supreme Gladiator fighter and an ex-Granny pant wearing enthusiast work? Well as it turns out it works pretty damn good. Crowe and Zellweger's performance is truly magnificent and creates a roller coaster ride of emotions the audience are hurled through. Jimmy is the protective, admirable, role model that almost has a super human quality due to the support and recognition gained from other characters in the storyline. Mae is the constant stay-at-home housewife who is constantly worrying about her husband and family's well being. The roles played by both actors are sublime, helping recreate the once lived story of the Braddock family and bring the performance to life. The actors are so believable that we feel every emotion they deal with and take every punch along with them, making the filmic experience of Cinderella Man all the more impressive.<br/><br/>The film doesn't just boast some of the best acting but impresses with the technical aspects it has incorporated. Scenes where Jimmy is fighting utilise quick paced cuts between punches and movements to really help the adrenaline flow through our system. I was certainly on the edge of my seat, weaving and dodging fists that were thrown Jimmy's way and gritting my teeth together when his punches are set in motion. The witty way shots from Jimmy's fights move from family and friend's reactions are successfully fashioned. The flash photography from the journalists in one scene particularly impressed me as with every flash it seems to jump to a different camera angle and with heavy punches that seem to knock down the camera the cut to the bar where friends are listening on the radio are almost unnoticed due of the tightness in continuity editing. This all smartly links to what is going through Jimmy's mind when fighting and the interpolation linking back and forth in his mind and through scenes really help us be a part of the film.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man for me really deserves praise and recognition and for anyone who hasn't seen it should highly consider doing so. You don't have to be a fan of boxing to enjoy this spectacle as there are many elements and angles that the film portrays, opening itself to a wide range of audiences. Going back to the theme of Rocky I feel is a way in which I can best explain the effect and success of Cinderella Man. Any fan of the Rocky series is sure to love this production and personally it stands out above it in terms of acting competence and its technical capability. I made my brother watch this with me, who is a fan of Rocky and I explained to him my thoughts before watching, he seemed unconvinced so I let the film do the talking for me. I think it was safe to say that his jaw was nicely dropped to the floor as though he'd just gone toe to toe with Jimmy himself. He too found himself being caught up in the moment the film wants you to and are shouting out just like the crowds watching the events. For me, Cinderella Man not only packs two hard punches to make it a huge hit but earns two thumbs up and my highest approval."

","Cinderella movie is a movie about a boxer who was a top contender early in his career but then faced a serious downturn in his career. At first he was just fighting on small events in front of very little people but then he also broke his hand. The promoters decided to stop using him on their boxing cards so he had to start working as a longshoreman on the docks. The lowest blow to him was when he had to accept government assistant to keep the electricity on. Then when the promoters needed a guy on short notice to fight one of their top contenders when his opponent fell out they call Braddock figuring it would just be an easy win for that contender but next thing you know Braddock pulls off the upset. Then they keep giving him more fights and he eventually earns a title shot against the unbeatable champ of the day Max Baer who was a 10-1 favorite when they fought.<br/><br/>This is a very uplifting movie about a man desperate to keep his family together and willing to do anything to accomplish this goal.<br/><br/>Braddock when he did get more money in the bank decided to return his government assistance money, which is unheard of IMO.<br/><br/>Ron Howard directed a classic movie with great performances by Russell Crowe, Paul Giamatti and Renee Zellweger."

I don't know how anyone can step into a ring, knowing that another man is trying to knock your head off. The punches are seen landing. The endurance necessary to keep going for fifteen rounds had to be phenomenal. But the scenes of the depression are also beautiful framed. Not just the sadness but the joys people still create. The group birthday party when all the kids celebrated their birthdays on the same day was something I wasn't aware of."

","I thought Cinderella Man was such a wonderful movie! I have seen several boxing films and was not expecting a lot from this one. Although this film tells a story similar to most other sports filmsone of redemption and successit made me feel like I have never seen a film with this particular theme. Jimmy Braddock portrays the human Seabiscuit and struggles through the Great Depression like most other families during the early 1930s. The film's plot kept me interested and I really enjoyed the classical music throughout. The cinematography and editing were also outstanding! I think the boxing matches showed the skilled cinematographer's and editor's talent and creativity. There were several quick shots throughout the matches and I felt close to Jimmy as he was seeing it in his perspective. After Jimmy got hit, the camera blurred and during the flashbacks the camera used darker colors to show his past. The mise en scene was excellent as well. The setting seemed accurate and it really did look like it was shot in New York and New Jersey. The lighting was appropriate in each situation; darker during the harder times and golden and lighter near the end and at the very beginning. The costumes also seemed a great fit and throughout the movie the men wore their suits and ties, which I read was what they really did. This showed they had not given up hope and it kept up their appearances, which was one of the only things many American citizens still had after they were hit hard by the Great Depression."

","America was a grim and desperate country during The Great Depression, but James Braddock (Russell Crowe) was one of the few bright spots in this true story about a down and out boxer who rose from the ashes to become the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" is an inspirational tale which shows how brutal and challenging life can be at times, yet people can survive and prosper while facing insurmountable odds when given the opportunity.<br/><br/>With his loving wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and children freezing and starving at home this fighter turned dockworker will do anything to change his family's fortunes. Opportunity knocks as Braddock's longtime trainer (Paul Giamatti) offers one last fight for the retired boxer. This man has nothing left to lose and everything to gain as he takes hold of his re-found career, surprising every contender with his unstoppable will. The fight scenes pull you in the ring with palm sweating action so close I found myself ducking in my seat.<br/><br/>Ron Howard's vivid re-creation of The Great Depression era, with bread lines, Hoovervilles, and humiliating welfare trips brilliantly displays life in the late 1920's and 30's. The costume design including hand me down rags and authentic settings with children playing in broken down Model T's really give the viewers a chance to see what life was like in these dark times.<br/><br/>While the underdog theme in this film is similar to ""Rocky"", that is where the comparisons should end as this story actually happened and Crowe's performance is a notch or two above Sylvester Stallone's.<br/><br/>If ever there was a need for a real hero for the American people to rally around then this was the time. Ron Howard's character development is endearing to all as everyone can relate to this workingman's fighter who has lived the struggle. The Max Baer character, womanizing, arrogant, and spoiled is a nice contrast to Crowe's hungry (literally and figuratively), loving, and honest depiction. James Braddock survived anything the Great Depression could throw at him with bravery and dignity, and came out on top."

","Cinderella Man has a sentiment that has you rooting for the long shot and live his dream with him, even though the theme of a has-been or underdog given a second chance to prove himself has been adopted numerous times in sports stories.<br/><br/>What struck me most was the parallels to the fictional Rocky story; even some of the boxing choreography looks the same. Of course, that may be unavoidable; there's only so many variations on a boxing match available--the sport by its nature is fairly predictable. However, this time the story is based on a real person, and the film is adept at making that person real up there on the screen. Jim Braddock, an apparent has-been boxer, gets back in the ring again due to an act of fate, and makes good with the opportunity. He was a symbol of hope for the little guy during the Depression, having been on some of those bread lines himself. <br/><br/>Russel Crowe is excellent as Braddock. You see every thought of the man, told through some clever filtered shots. I love one shot of Paul Giamatti (who is great, too), as his manager, getting in his face, shouting and screaming to him to kill the guy. (It reminded me of those Twilight Zone shots where someone is losing their sanity, and other characters are taunting them.) My favorite in the supporting cast was Rene Zellweger, who is wonderful as Braddock's wife. She matched the wonderful job of Talia Shire as Rocky's girl--the same touchingly real terror that her man could very easily get his head bashed in at any second. Craig Beirko as Max Baer, the champion, is excellent in his nasty rival persona, although I think they took some artistic license on Baer's true character, to evoke more rooting for Braddock as the ""good guy."" A fine movie for anyone who likes a good sports drama story."

","""The Bulldog of Bergen,"" Jim Braddock was a fighter who came out of the depths of the Depression to win the World Heavyweight Championship against incredible odds, one who lived to see himself honored as a folk hero, a legend of sports, and one of New Jersey's first citizens. Had he lived long enough to see Ron Howard's excellent film on his life, ""Cinderella Man,"" he would have almost certainly approved.<br/><br/>A box-office disappointment when released, and all but overlooked at the Oscars, ""Cinderella Man"" is, nonetheless, one of the best films of 2005 in the opinion of everyone I've known who has seen it, as well as myself. As much as Peter Jackson in ""King Kong,"" Howard and his team take a grimy, unsentimental look at the Depression Era that is both fascinating and unsettling at the same time. The New Jersey/New York area of Braddock's time, as well as such venues as the old Madison Square Garden Bowl in Long Island City, are faithfully and meticulously recreated. Howard's direction is, as always, right on top of things. The pace doesn't slacken for a minute, the storytelling always grabs you.<br/><br/>But technical aspects are only part of what makes a movie great. There are also the performances, and in this respect, ""Cinderella Man""'s cast doesn't disappoint. Russell Crowe gives his best performance yet (And, no, I'm not forgetting Howard's earlier ""A Beautiful Mind"") as Braddock. He doesn't play the part, he IS the part, gentle and loving with his family, a hard worker on the docks, a tiger in the ring. Renee Zellweger effectively de-glamorizes herself as Braddock's loving wife, Mae, tender yet tough. Paul Giamatti definitely earned his Oscar nomination as Braddock's best friend/manager Joe Gould, who won't give up on Jim even when everybody else has. And Craig Bierko gives an appropriately over-the-top performance as Max Baer, Sr., the flamboyant champ, a devil with the ladies and in the ring, whom Braddock challenges for the championship. This was the performance that motivated Baer's son, actor/producer Max Baer, Jr. (Jethro on ""The Beverly Hillbillies""), to sue the producers, claiming, justifiably, that they presented a very one-sided view of his father, turning him, for the sake of a good story, into a villain he was far from being.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie about the triumph of the human spirit. Once you see it, you will never forget it, and always want to come back again.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the DVD of ""Cinderella Man"" (a nickname for Braddock coined by Damon Runyon) features several interesting bonus features. There is a commentary track by Ron Howard, cut scenes, newsreel footage of Braddock in action, and interviews with Braddock's family."

","This was a great movie - the story of Braddock's struggles to support his family and his comeback from losing them to the Great Depression is paralleled by his fortunes in the ring. The only negative is the unjustly inaccurate portrayal of Max Baer as an arrogant, sadistic villain. Cruel poverty was villain enough without portraying Baer falsely in this light. Ironically, this is the second film to do this. The first was the 1956 film, ""The Harder They Fall,"" a thinly disguised biopic on Primo Carnera. In that film, a character very obviously based upon Max Baer is also portrayed as an arrogant, sadistic villain, by none other than...Max Baer! Go figure. Other than this, the film is a hit. Russell Crowe is great in a very different part for him and Paul Giamatti shines as the saavy Joe Gould."

","I had to check IMDb while watching CM to verify that it is indeed Craig Bierko ""channeling"" Baer. In a movie filled with fantastic performances, his portrayal of the great Max Baer really blew me away. I'm amazed that there hasn't been more buzz about the work he did in this vastly underrated film.<br/><br/>I also have to agree with a previous post; somebody should do a biopic about Max Baer. In my opinion, the ""Golden Era"" of heavy weight boxing that began with Jack Johnson in the early 1900's, went through Jack Dempsey, Braddock, Baer, Joe Lewis, etc. until Muhammed Ali in the 1970's, should be made into a full length film. Seems that the sport just doesn't have the cache today that it had during that era."

","I had a pugilistic ball watching ""Cinderella Man"". Director Ron Howard's bio of Great Depression boxer Jim Braddock is the most inspiring film of the year. Russell Crowe was a knockout as Braddock. Do not get so hung up on Crowe's real life phone banging ordeal. His uppercut performance as Braddock was of the heavyweight thespian class. Braddock was an upstart boxer of the late 20's when his fate turned for the worse and was heavily affected by the Great Depression of the 30's. He started losing fights, losing money, and close to even losing life. However, he had the tenacious courage to comeback and re-energize his boxing career and eventually became a champion pugilist! It is a real Cinderella story! Renee Zelweger plays his devoted wife Mae. Mae I say that I was impressed by Renee's performance here. Paul Giamatti diverse acting training came in handy with his hands-on charismatic performance as Braddock's trainer Joe Gould. Giamatti keeps proving that he is as good as ""Gould"" with each acting project he undertakes. Howard masterfully directed the film and was a technical artist with the exceptional champion boxing scenes. Probably the supreme boxing scenes in movie history! Sly Stallone and Martin Scorsese probably want to punch me out by that last comment.

","Cinderella Man is the story of human victory over seemingly impossible odds. Russell Crowe plays legendary boxer James J. Braddock in Ron Howard's well directed film based on the life of this astounding man.<br/><br/>Set during the Great Depression the film takes on the tone of loss as we witness Braddock's initial rise in the boxing ring and then his rapid decline during the disastrous economic punch that landed a low-blow to America. Millions are out of work and on the street. Families are ripped apart. But Braddock and his wife Mae (played by Renee Zellweger) will do anything to keep their heads above water while remaining morally upstanding citizens.<br/><br/>Like many families, the Braddocks have to sell just about everything to stay alive. And once everything of value is gone, Braddock has to work at the back-breaking docks, but even that's not enough to sustain them. Braddock is forced to beg for money from acquaintances, and this is a terribly humiliating event to watch. But if that wasn't enough, he has to go to the government office for public assistance.<br/><br/>Then a glimmer of hope arrives. His old manager Joe Gould (the awesomely intense Paul Giamoti) offers him one last fight with a heavyweight title contender. The assumption is that Braddock will lose, not having trained for months and having eaten only scraps off the street. But Braddock wins, relaunching his career and eventually getting a shot at Max Baer, the champ who's blows have killed two men already.<br/><br/>History tells us that Braddock wins this fight, to the surprise of the then boxing commission and to the joy of millions of downtrodden Americans.<br/><br/>More interesting than the crunching blows and bloody fights are the surrounding circumstances of what America was going through at the time and how Braddock held his head high (at least as high as he could) in such trying times.<br/><br/>Getting a myopic view of family life during this time was a powerful way to present such a rags to riches story. The costumes and sets were spot-on period perfect and completely immersed the viewer in the times. Filming the struggling family pulled the movie-watcher close to the Braddocks and gave a sense of empathy that few directors can match these days. And the brutal boxing scenes were painful to watch. I flinched several times, wanting to look away but unable to for fear of missing something.<br/><br/>Having lavished such praise on this film, I have to comment on the cookie-cutout cinema Mr. Howard chooses to shoot (you remember Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind, right?) Although I enjoy these heart-wrenching and uplifting movies, I do wish that Mr. Howard could break out of that mold and produce something beyond the mainstream.<br/><br/>But make no mistake, this is an intense movie with graphic depictions of Braddock landing obscenely hard blows ...and taking them, too. The greatness of the actual filming cannot be denied but the commonality of it won't surprise those who've seen a Ron Howard film in the past."

","Cinderella Man/2005/****<br/><br/>Main Stars: Russell Crowe Paul Giamatti Renée Zelwegger<br/><br/>Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" is truly a wonderful film! It's about boxing just like Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"". There is also Sylvester Stallone's ""Rocky"" but that was a long time ago. But Ron Howard's boxing film beat Clint Eastwood's boxing film by a little. Although ""Million Dollar Baby"" was excellent and all, it was about a woman boxer and seeing a woman getting beat up and bloody just didn't feel right. Yes, it was excellent because it was different (about a young woman instead of a man), had excellent acting by everyone, and had more to it than just plain boxing. But so did ""Cinderella Man"". It had a background of what James J. Braddock's (Russell Crowe's) life was like beyond the boxing, about his children, wife (Renée Zelwegger), job (besides boxing), and, of course, The Great Depression. This is definitely a period movie. Set in the 1930s, everything looked convincing; the sets, cars, outfits, buildings. This is definitely a good-looking film let alone an excellent film by itself. The film starts out with a boxing match and ends with a boxing match (how original). But yet that's just the beginning and end. In the middle, there is so much going on and you really get into it. Why(?) because there has never been a film like it before. Yes, there are many films about boxing including ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Ali"", ""Rocky"" (A CLASSIC), ""Rocky II"" (III, IV, and V), ""Raging Bull"" (A CLASSIC), ""Champion"", ""Body and Soul"", and many more But yet not too many films are about boxing and The Great Depression (when the stocks went down, not everyone could get jobs, etc.). This truly was a Ron Howard masterpiece! Then you get his other films that were flunks (got a lot of money but weren't that good) like one I can definitely name: ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" with Jim Carrey as THE GRINCH! I was surprised to see Directed by Ron Howard for that film because his films are always good and and that one just wasn't. He doesn't seem to direct a film of that type meaning a pretty bad comedy. He I can see directing ""Cinderella Man"" because that is a type of movie he would make: an adventure-drama, action, maybe some humor too This film, even though it was a drama, had some humor from Jimmy Braddock's trainer (played by Paul Giamatti) and it's always good to have some humor. Throughout the film, Jimmy fought and fought and never gave up and soon earned the nickname ""Cinderella Man"" and even Renée Zelwegger's character thought it was girly. She chuckled in the movie, ""Cinderella Man"", that's kinda girly."" Everything was fine and dandy in the film (except for some of the beginning during the horrible Great Depression) until Jimmy's trainer starts to get a little stricter when he has to face someone named Max Baer because he is known to be a tough boxer; killing already two people in the boxing ring. Jimmy is a little nervous when watching footage on an old projector of this guy punching and punching and punching this other boxer until the boxer slows down and falls to the ground. Max Baer then looks at Jimmy with an evil face. This gets Jimmy thinking. Should he fight or should he not? Remember he has kids and a wife that he has to take care of and who are scared for him. But there is a somewhat not melancholy ending. It is an excellent film! Throughout the film, is a great story (a dramatization of a true story), great acting, and great sets. I sincerely think that Ron Howard will become one of the greatest directors of all time! Movie directed by Ron Howard."

","This film didn't get a nod for the Academy Award in 2005. The reason, many reasons, but I might sum up Liberal Hollywood's aversion to a conservative manly man, succeeding against all odds in a tough world isn't the same as two less manly men, Truman Capote, race obsessed cops, or an effeminate Transsexual whining about a tough world run by gasp, Bush!!!! Those warm sepia toned 1930's are recreated for us by Ron Howard. Not much fun starving to death is there? Yet Crowe's Braddock, an injured fighter working the docks to support his family, he doesn't cry. He does what he has to do without stealing or sniveling. He is forever optimistic despite all setbacks. He is a beacon of light for his hungry family. This is undoubtedly the Story of Seabiscuit on two legs, but because we are dealing with one of the best film actors in the world, we can empathize readily.<br/><br/>Forget Rocky, CM has the best fight scenes I have ever seen. Sure, they are choreographed, but who cares. We really hated Max Baer and Braddock handles the fool, no prob. Thanks for the uplifting, Conservative message, Ron Howard."

","When I finally watched Cinderella Man on DVD I found myself living all over again the essence of the Great Depression! I am an 80 year old woman, whose widowed mother was left to raise two daughters on income derived from a renting a brownstone building in Brooklyn in the 30s as a rooming house. Large rooms were $5.00 per week. Hall bedrooms were rented for $2.00 per week. Even at these low prices, tenants were unable to pay their rent on a timely basis. Since our livelihood depended on the rents, when the rent was not forthcoming we were left without sufficient food to feed us. Some of the tenants existed on help from the Welfare system, but used their rent money for things other than their rent sometimes. I say all of this to explain why I could relate to the scenes where Jim Braddock and his family did not have milk or sufficient food for the family. I cried during my viewing of this film, because of its truthfulness in depicting these conditions in their reality.<br/><br/>I wish that this film could be distributed again so that more people could see it! I think that the title Cinderella Man, though it was the title given to Jim Braddock, was partly the reason people may not have been attracted to it. I know that when I saw the title, I was not particularly interested in seeing it. Now, I could kick myself for not adding to its financial support so that it could have had<br/><br/>its due as an Oscar contender. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and the complete cast did the film proud!! Their interpretations were right on and so natural, I felt everything as it unfolded. Especially compelling was the Max Baer championship fight. I watched this film in my bed and I watched the fight as if I had never heard about any of it before. I jumped up and down and yelled when the two fighters fought fiercely to survive.I hate to watch violence and especially Boxing events, but there I was! <br/><br/>This film is magnificent!!

","I'm not a fan of boxing, and I'm certainly not an admirer of Russell Crowe - but ""Cinderella Man"" may well be Ron Howard's best movie since ""Apollo 13"" (I've yet to see ""A Beautiful Mind,"" but since Akiva Goldsman is the primary writer on that, I'm not holding my breath), and a rare sports movie that even I like.<br/><br/>At heart it's a feelgood movie, but the kind that reviewers can like without feeling guilty - no actual gloss, plenty of grit, and no cheating. Done with skill and care by the director and writers Cliff Hollingsworth and Goldsman, the story of boxer Jim Braddock's early promise and his toils through the Depression may wear its bid for Oscar glory a bit too obviously sometimes, but with Crowe as Braddock, the excellent Paul Giamatti as his trainer, Renee Zellweger as his wife and the rest of the cast on top form, you just don't notice enough for it to matter.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes are far from ""Rocky""-type showbiz, though for some reason Braddock's fight against Lasky seems a bit more dramatic than his climax against Max Baer; but the best thing about the movie is that it would be just as gripping even without the violence (witness the second scene where he goes to the relief office). A few of the relationships are a bit sketchy - certainly that with his best friend could have been dealt with a bit more - but ultimately the movie keeps you going right up to the finish.<br/><br/>I'm finding it a lot easier to write about bad movies than good ones, so I'll just say that in spite of it not having Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, ""Cinderella Man"" is a genuine million dollar baby."

","""In all the history of the boxing game, you'll find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of James J. Braddock."" - Damon Runyon (1936) Yet another boxing movie on the heels of Ali and Million Dollar Baby you might add? Yes, and agreeing with Runyon, this movie, director Ron Hward's second collaboration with Russell Crowe (the first being A Beautiful Mind), about the Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock packs a wallop like Ali and brings on some sniffles like Baby.<br/><br/>James Braddock is on track to take a shot at the heavyweight boxing title, living the life with his family of 3 kids, until the Great Depression sets in. Braddock too was affected after poor investment calls, and hence join the millions who are jobless and penniless. Given a second chance by Fate to re-enter the boxing arena, he finds himself back into a sport which had forgotten him, and is determined to succeed in order to sustain his family through the Depression. He isn't boxing for himself, for fame and glory, but more so to bring back the bacon for his hungry children.<br/><br/>I haven't seen many dramatic films set during the Great Depression, and this meshing of boxing and drama set against that background worked extremely well, with its majestic sets. Family is important to Jim, and he goes to great pains to ensure his family is able to stay together during these turbulent times. Personifying Hope, he's the working class' underdog hero, during a time when the very rich were still living it off comfortably.<br/><br/>The transition style used, though not new, are well executed, like the mirror cum dressing table scene from pre-Depression to Depression era, and the transition from match to match using overhead shots. The boxing action sequences are extremely well choreographed, and you'll feel every urge to get up and shadow box alongside Jim as well. Every hit in the cheeks, in the chest, smack on the kisser, at times slow down to a photographic moment, complete with old fashioned camera flashes. Unlike Million Dollar Baby's bailing of the sport to end with euthanasia, this one is boxing out and out, right until the gruelling 15 round finale with champ Max Baer.<br/><br/>Much is said about Russell Crowe's performance as Jim Braddock, and I'd say he deserved the praises. Ranging as the tough as nails fighter in the ring, to tender loving husband and father, his role as Jim allowed him to showcase his acting chops yet again. He has a charismatic screen presence, be it general-turned-gladiator, or schizophrenic genius, he never fails to draw the audience into his role. Renee Zellweger was cast in a safe role as Jim's dutiful wife Mae, looking after the household as Jim seeked dough, always backing and supporting her husband, yet always worrying about his injuries, or worse, death. Put both of them together, and you'll see a lovely couple who sticks with each other through good times and bad.<br/><br/>But the surprise scene stealer was Paul Giamatti (Sideways' Miles) as Jim's manager Joe Gould, the ever encouraging, ever opportunity seeker and chief adviser of Jim's gameplay. In one particularly moving scene, he explained the need for keeping up appearances, and staked almost everything he had to back their boxing comeback. And EPL Soccer Man Utd fans, is it just me, or does Max Baer (Craig Bierko), the heavyweight champ in the final fight, resemble Ruud Van Nistelrooy from certain angles (attitude too)? Amongst the slew of releases this week, Cinderella Man ranks as number One on the ""To-Watch"" list. Some might criticise the lack of sophistication in telling a Hollywood tale, but it is precisely this familiarity which allows you to connect. Does this movie scream Oscar? Probably, but given boxing cousin Million Dollar Baby snagging most of the previous awards, Cinderella Man might be in for a tough fight to convince voters. Nonetheless, it's highly recommended."
"alanjones792","7","0","0","18 September 2005"," Captivating
","I went to this film with a certain amount of scepticism having never been a fan of either boxing or Russell Crowe. However, I was hooked from almost the first shot - the acting is top notch from Crowe as the courageous Jim Braddock through Connor Price,Ariel Waller,Patrick Louis as his three children (the first good performances I've seen from child actors all year). The direction from Howard is superb capturing the savagery of the sport perfectly (the theatre I was in gasped and winced during the fight scenes) and drawing the viewer deeply into such a dark period of America's history. This story of Braddock's rise, fall and rise is well-paced, brilliantly scripted and as captivating as any film of recent times. The characters act believably and are crafted to perfectly elicit the required reactions that the film-makers want the cinema-goer to feel. Overall this is a superb must see movie and I hope it garners some Oscar nominations at least, certainly Crowe deserves a nomination(Best Actor) and possibly Paul Giamatti (Best Supporting) for a considered portrayal as Braddock's manager Joe Gould.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say along with Crash this is the best film of 2005 so far and, in the genre of Boxing films is second only to (obviously) Scorsese/De Niro's Raging Bull.<br/><br/>8/10 - Highly recommended."

It makes me want to write a review because it is so good.<br/><br/>This movie is never bothering. It shows not only the life of James Braddock but it also shows how people in the 30's were hit by the depression. The combination of both intriguing stories makes you sit on the top of your chair for 2,5 hours.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie based upon a true story was no problem for me either. Some of these kind of movies suffer from the fact that you already know how it's going to end (Apollo 13, Troy, ...) but I wasn't familiar with the Braddock-story. So on top of all the good aspects of the movie I also was really curious for the ending.<br/><br/>Finally a word about the cast which in my view did a great job (especially Russel Crowe) bringing the characters to life.<br/><br/>In each case I found this movie much better than that other recent boxing movie One Million Dollar Baby, which I found way too sentimental."

","I must say that few movies in today's cinema world present the public with characters that can be admired, lauded, and emulated to the improvement of the real world. Granted, what people count as admirable or praiseworthy characteristics are about as diverse as the characters in today's cinema world (I am often reminded of the conversation between Commodus and Marcus Aurelius in ""Gladiator""), but I personally was impressed with and compelled by the character of Jim Braddock in ""Cinderella Man"".<br/><br/>Before I go too much more into Jim Braddock's character, I want to comment that I myself am a boxing fan in some respects, but the concept of boxing, if seriously pondered, leads me to conclude that making a sport out of two people harming one another with the purpose of causing enough damage to your opponent that he or she loses consciousness makes reason stare. But like Jim says in the movie, people die all the time but someone's found a way to make money off of it in boxing.<br/><br/>Apart from the boxing part of the story, of which there is surprisingly little in the first half of the movie, I found the story of survival without moral compromise to be almost without equal in the film world today. Additionally, the fact that this is based on a true story makes Jim's character and the story of ""Cinderella Man"" even more noteworthy.<br/><br/>I watched with considerable discomfort and pain the suffering of that little family in the throes of the great depression. My emotional commitment was even greater as I watched Jim's optimism, self-sacrifice, and nobility pressed to their limits. I was moved as I watched him overcome each trial with humble, dignified determination. For me his character was polished with every challenge he faced and overcame, shining brighter and brighter as the film progressed.<br/><br/>I loved this film because of Jim Braddock. Ron Howard's talent is remarkable, but I have found myself more compelled by the boxing in other films. But what this film has is a truly heroic character whose story happens to involve boxing. Had Jim Braddock been a basketball player or a skateboarder, I think the story would have, in many respects, worked just as well. For me, this movie isn't as much about boxing as ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Rocky."" In this movie you watch Jim fight to survive outside of the ring more than you watch him fight inside the ring. But it's the story of this man's fights, and how relentless, punishing, and overwhelming those fights are, watching this everyman overcomes fight after fight, integrity intact, that makes this movie great.<br/><br/>Jim Braddock is the kind of movie hero, and real world hero, that we need to see more of today. The quality of his character is of equal value, and I think greater need, today as it was in the 1930's. What a remarkable story. What a remarkable man."

","""Cinderella Man"", rated PG-13, is a solid four and a half ""popcorns"". The 2005 drama, is brought to the big screen by the award winning director Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, EDtv, The Missing). With the outstanding performances of the trio: Russell Crow, Renée Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti, Howard brought yet another story to the big screen, loaded it with both tear-jerking and heart-swelling moments; packed it with honorable leading characters, and artistically conveyed good morals.<br/><br/>I took my 16 year old friend, 18 and 13 year old sisters, along with my 14 year old brother to see ""Cinderella Man"". We all loved it. In our opinion it is the best movie of the year. Ron Howard brought a great story of perseverance, romance, drama, and action to moviegoers in ""Cinderella Man"". This movie has great morals for all ages as it teaches you to never give up and keep pressing forward. It inspires men to be strong fathers and husbands no matter what happens and to teach their children right from wrong. The scene where Jim's son returns the stolen food also teaches people to be honest and that they should work for what they need. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody over 10 years old. Parents this is a boxing movie so the violence may be too intense in spots for younger viewers. There is some profanity in this movie that was not needed, however, there wasn't the use of the F-word in this movie like most of your PG-13 movies.<br/><br/>The ""Cinderella Man"" is a wonderful true story of a professional boxer, James J. Braddock (Russell Crow). Not only was he a great boxer, he was also an admirable father and husband dedicated to keeping his wife ( Renée Zellweger) and their three children together during the Great Depression. Over-due bills, electricity out and with only five dollars to his name, ""The Bulldog of Bergen"" has all but lost his boxing bite and is scrambling for work alongside 15 million other unemployed Americans. Finally after a long time of despair, a little light shines though the darkness when Jim's boxing manager, Joe Gould( Paul Giamatti), shows up out of the blue with a proposition. It turns out that the number two heavyweight in the world needs a last minute replacement to fight for $250. The fact that Jim has never been knocked out makes him an attractive story line. Sporting makeshift gloves and a fighter's robe with the wrong name on it, Jim is simply expected to show up, take a few hits and collect his paycheck. But the unexpected happens... Jim KO's his opponent! Jim now has new life breathed into his previously dismal existence, another chance. One victory leads to another ... and another and another ... until Jim has suddenly rekindled hope among the down-and-out Irish-American community rallying around its newfound underdog hero. Jim, now dubbed the ""Cinderella Man,"" is lined up to fight the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world, Max Baer( Craig Bierko), an arrogant giant who has already killed two men in the ring.<br/><br/>Again not like your average PG-13 or PG movie, ""Cinderella Man"" has absolutely no sexual content. Men are shown smoking in some scenes. Parents this is one of the cleanest movies out there. It's powerful in its portrayal of life. ""Cinderella Man"" is as powerful as its hero's punches."

","Maybe it is because I am an avid fan of the sport, but these past few years have really been fun for me at the box office. Two huge boxing box office pictures(try and say that three times fast). As seen in Cinderella Man, this is a sport that can either make or break a human. Jim Braddock was the epitome of what this magnificent sport means. You may be standing in your local supermarket and the man standing next to you could be the welterweight champion of the world. You wouldn't even know. That is the beauty of boxing. It lacks all of the glamour and glitter of all the other major sports(for the most part). This is and always will be a blue collar sport, as illustrated in the movie.<br/><br/>O.K- Now to talk about the movie. Jim Braddock was a fighter during the Great Depression. He not only had to fight in the ring, but to feed his wife and children as well. I wont go on about all of the magnificent dialogue and very well choreographed fight scenes(they put a punching bag on the lower part of the camera for Crowe to punch to give a more realistic affect). I will. however, leave you with one of my personal favorite scenes in the movie. After Braddock(Crowe) hits rock bottom financially, he goes back to the boxing commission and has to literally beg for money. Boxing fan or not, this movie is a must see for anyone."

","(watched in Toronto)<br/><br/>Based on the life of heavyweight champion James Braddock (Russell Crowe), Cinderella Man is a semi-fictional tale told in simple, good old fashion narrative form, a story on courage and human dignity in face of adversity. After a brief opening scene of Braddock at the height of fame and fortune, the movie losses no time is plunging him right into the vicissitudes during the Depression era, when, suffering from a broken hand, he can hardly bring in enough to feed his family, working as a longshoreman. Director Ron Howard does not shy away from taking us very slowly, in this 2-and-a-half-hour movie, through the most desperate struggles of James and Mae (Renee Zellweger) Braddock. The second half of the movie is on Braddock's miraculous comeback, ""from the breadline to contesting for the heavyweight championship title within a year"" thereby becoming the inspiration for people losing all hope during the depression.<br/><br/>One could look at this movie as a period piece, against the backdrop of the American Depression era (and many have compared it to ""Seabiscuit""). Cinderella Man however can be appreciated without any period reference. Poverty is universal. Not wanting to part with one's family is universal. Courage and human dignity are universal.<br/><br/>With so many pugilistic movies that have gone on before (even Elvis Presley had ""Kid Galahad"") you would really wonder what Ron Howard could do to make his finale memorable. Well, he did it by going all out, pulling all the plugs. In addition to what is happening in the ring, we see Braddock's children huddled in a basement cell listening to the radio broadcast of the match, against their mother's explicit prohibition (but soon joined by aunts and grannies, and a resigning mother). We also see Braddock's fans gathered around the radio in pubs as well as in church, and in the latter case the priest shadow-boxing at the critical moments, completely absorbed in the match. These cross cuttings have a multiplier effect (pardon an economic term) on what we see happening in the ring, pushing the audience to one emotional height after another, culminating in a gloriously uplifting finale.<br/><br/>But the fight is actually over at around the middle of the movie. When Braddock stoops so low as to go, cap-in-hand, to the plush club where his former acquaintances have gathered to beg for nineteen dollars so that his kids do not have to be sent away to live with relatives, he has ironically reached the pinnacle of his dignity. The movie clearly shows this, as we see after this scene a changed man in Braddock, confident, truly cheerful but gentle and loving as ever. He has already won the fight.<br/><br/>Crowe is not among my favourite male leads but this all-goodness persona he has adopted for this movie is truly likable. Inimitable Zellweger provides solid support and has good chemistry with Crowe. Better still is the spark between Crowe and Paul Giamatti playing his manager. The relationship is somewhat similar to (but not entirely alike) that between Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman's characters in ""Million Dollar Baby"", a professional relationship forming the basis of genuine friendship. If I were a betting man, I would put my money of Giamatti getting at least a best supporting nomination for this year's Oscar, if not winning it."

","This movie is a winner on most counts. Russell Crowe is amazing as the depression-era fighter James Braddock; his manager - played by Paul Giamatti is effective; and Bruce McGill holds his own against both. Even Renée Zellweger (who I sometimes find to be a bit affected) as his wife, has her moments and is very good. <br/><br/>While something could be said about not really showing 'who' Jim Braddock was, by all accounts he was an uncomplicated man devoted to his family. So possibly, the movie was factual in not showing more. But the criticism is minor, and in all actuality does not take anything away from the film.<br/><br/>And even though I knew the outcome, the suspense still built up in the final scenes, and provided a crowd pleasing ending that was not in the least bit contrived, maudlin, or false. Ron Howard has created anther fine film, and proves once again (as if he needed to) that he is a major directorial talent."

","Good performances by all (I particularly liked Paul Giamatti). Howard didn't not try to strangle the movie with smurfy moments with the kids. The boxing matches got the blood up. But... eh. No great lesson to learn about life (other than to not give up, to show tenacity in the face of adversity, blah, blah blah). Nothing to ponder upon. I think the genius of Howard is that with this incredibly formulaic story, he managed not to overly bog it down with schmaltz, or loose tension throughout the movie. But it is a real formulaic story.<br/><br/>It gets a plus for not avoiding to show uglier aspects of the Depression. It gets a minus for lying about Max Baer in order to make him look more like a villain.<br/><br/>Maybe its me. Maybe I need more existential angst in a movie. Maybe these glowing comment reviews with almost no negative ones irk me. I never did like Rocky. But Million Dollar Baby was a much better boxing movie. Its a disgrace that Cinderella Man got killed in the box office by junk like Revenge of the Sith, or the Longest Yard, but this movie does not belong in the top 250 list."
"nowonmai42","7","0","0","18 July 2005"," Non-formulaic formula
","""Cinderella Man"" immediately corners itself with its name alone. Why give 2 plus hours of your life to a movie that telegraphs its intentions in the very title? Yet Ron Howard's film seems to relish the challenge of giving heft to a story that doggedly follows formula; the title could describe the film itself as well as the story it tells.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe gives a performance of quiet intensity as Depression-era boxer Jim Braddock. It's good to see Crowe channeling his penchant for fisticuffs toward the screen for once, and it pays off in his restrained, yet fully realized, portrayal of a man trying to keep his family afloat while seemingly everyone sinks around him. Well, not everyone. Braddock is fortunate to have connections among wealthy boxing promoters, who keep him fighting until a broken hand leads to his decommission, and destitution. He can't fight, and the dock bosses aren't likely to pick a gimp for a day's work. Already having promised his worried son that he'll never send him away, Braddock's situation soon looks as hopeless as nearly everyone else's. There's a powerful scene of him showing up to his former promoters, hat literally in hand, pleading for a few bucks to keep the lights on at home.<br/><br/>But this being a comeback story, we know ""the Bulldog"" Braddock will be back in the ring, jabbing his way toward improbable glory. It's no surprise, then, when he surprisingly knocks out a heavyweight contender for whom he was supposed to be a tune up. Nor do we expect a seemingly debilitating rib injury to stand too much in the way of Braddock's victory march. As for his final title fight, could it go any shorter than a full 15 rounds, or feature anything less than a seemingly invincible opponent with a habit of leaving corpses in the ring? If you're unsure of any of this, kindly refer back to the title.<br/><br/>Howard is smart with this stuff, though, and keeps pugilistic matters mostly in the background. There's no waxing poetic about the purity of boxing; no paeans to the sweetness of its science. Braddock doesn't even seem to enjoy his profession much more than he would a round of darts with the boys at the pub. It's a job when few are available, a chance to keep his family fed and sheltered when no other options are open. Crowe's Braddock tries hard to keep cool in the worst of adversity; he doesn't rise to the provocations of title-holder Max Baer at a pre-fight banquet, and calmly understands his wife's near-hysteria at the prospect of widowhood. Things are tough enough without flying off the handle. Paul Giamatti, always fun to watch, does a nice turn as Braddock's sincere manager who sells all he has to finance his man's training. It's great to see Hollywood taking notice of Giamatti, who seems to inhabit fully all of his roles in spite of his untraditional profile.<br/><br/>By openly copping to a by-the-numbers underdog story, ""Cinderella Man"" frees itself up to focus on the much more interesting hardscrabble lives of its characters outside the ring. This film deftly reminds us that formula doesn't have to be formulaic."

","It's not like there haven't already been any boxing movies (Million Dollar Baby), or Depression era ""underdog sports icon gives hope to the common man"" movies (Seabiscuit) done in the last couple years. Even Russell Crowe seemed at times to be retreading his role from Gladiator, the former hero who meets misfortune but rises back up against the odds. But although Cinderalla Man doesn't bring any new themes to the screen, and yes, is a little on the formulaic side, somehow it does everything so -right- that it's easily one of the top films of the year.<br/><br/>Crowe, Renée Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti form a triumvirate of strong performances, each complementing the other and not one overacting his or her role. Some superb directing and camera-work led to the most intense fight scenes I've ever seen in a movie about boxing, as well as memorable moments outside of the ring (my favorites include a clever bit of bait-and-switch perspective at Joe's apartment, and a priceless shot when Jimmy teaches his young daughter how to punch him in the head).<br/><br/>The period sets are beautifully crafted and believable, to the point where you can almost taste the hunger and desperation felt by all but the wealthiest. There's also something to be said about the value of understatement, of which Cinderella Man does a very good job; the story moves along from scene to scene without coddling the audience by showing everything, and as a result never drags or has a dull moment.<br/><br/>In a couple small spots, formula rears its head - most noticeably the ""time to get in shape"" training montage seen in just about every sports movie in existence - but luckily the quality of direction, acting, and production value is enough to set this one apart from average fare. A masterful setup going into the third act gives you a very real sense of fear and uncertainty right before that final fight everyone knows is coming; all but the most jaded film viewers are guaranteed to be on edge because by this time, you'll genuinely care about Jim's survival.<br/><br/>With so many things done well, I can think of very little that needs to be changed. Top-notch material all around."

","Not that Cinderella Man needs any more positive reviews, there is a noteworthy observation I wanted to share: while Cinderella Man is the Jim Braddock story, it an equally worthy presentation of the Depression era, and the great struggles that faced Americans only 75 years ago. This is a movie which represents how art can make a dignified and powerful connection to its audience, and communicate something more than just a personal saga, a great love, fast action, or a confusing canvas with paint splattered on it. This movie would do commendable service as a screening film in high-school auditoriums for all kids, especially young boys. A compelling story, action, excellent acting and the excellent script will keep their attention, and exposure to an era of hardship and hard work will make for a lesson well learned to a young generation in which dignity, character, and values seem otherwise lost."

","Excellently told story. As usual, you should not assume this means it is perfectly faithful to history. (Russell Crowe and Ron Howard collaborated before on ""A Beautiful Mind,"" and I now know that that was wildly inaccurate historically and scientifically--things didn't quite happen that way, and they explained Nash's theories incorrectly.) I kept thinking while watching ""Cinderella"": I have heard of Max Baer and Joe Louis, but Jim Braddock? I was totally surprised by the ending, which goes to show how much of a boxing buff I am (not).<br/><br/>Good acting by the principals, but I fear Craig Bierko will be overlooked for the Academy Award nomination he deserves for his performance as a truly scary Max Baer.<br/><br/>It is amusing to say that there are no tricks used to tell this story; the use of intra-psychic imagery (showing us how the character ""sees"" what he or she is looking at in contrast to how it would appear to the objective observer) must have been done subtly enough or else we are now trained to accept this in movies so that one can overlook it."
"meger_7","9","0","0","15 July 2005"," A sleeping ""Cinderella?""
","I don't know what's more impressive; the fact that Russell Crowe keeps reinventing himself in every new role he takes on or the fact that Ron Howard is coming into his own as a great director. Several years ago when Howard and Crowe teamed up for A BEAUTIFUL MIND, they walked away with an Oscar for Best Picture. That's pretty impressive and hard to top, so what would be their encore? I think that question was answered with the release of Cinderella MAN. With all the summer blockbuster's taking over the box office these days, a small film like Cinderella MAN might get overlooked. But, that will be a big mistake in my mind after seeing this powerful story up front and personal. Not only is this film the sleeper of the summer, it might just be the best film of the year when it's all said and done. That might be jumping the gun a bit, but I guarantee if this film was released during the Oscar push later this year, it would be nominated for Best Picture. That's how good this film was and how much of a mistake it would be to pass up the opportunity to see it.<br/><br/>I think by now most people expect a great showing by Russell Crowe and I would have to agree. To some people, Crowe should be the only actor picked for epics, but it's not the epics that define him. It's the roles like the one in A BEAUTIFUL MIND and now Cinderella MAN that truly show how amazing he really is. He brings such natural emotion and reality to his roles that you forget you're watching Russell Crowe. The audience felt every step of his journey which can be attributed to Crowe and director Ron Howard. But, that journey spilled over into the rest of the cast and they too were amazing, as most are opposite Crowe. Leading that group was of course Renee Zellweger, who I must say was impressive as Mae. I think maybe the Oscar for CHICAGO she received a couple years ago wasn't as premature as I originally thought given how powerful she was in this one. And then there was Paul Giamatti, who once again produces a great performance worthy of praise. Giamatti (AMERICAN SPLENDOR, SIDEWAYS), who played Braddock's manager Paul Gould, continues to make his mark in Hollywood and I would bet there's an Oscar waiting for him in the not too distant future.<br/><br/>Given the fact that Cinderella MAN appears to be yet another ""hero"" boxing flick, I would bet most people would steer clear of this film. But, that would be a mistake in my mind after watching this story unfold. Not only did Ron Howard bring in the perfect actor to play Jim ""The Bulldog of Bergen"" Braddock, but he was able to carve out an original look at this famed story that frankly many people don't know about. This movie wasn't as much about boxing as it was about life and how tough it was during the Depression and how one boxer gave the whole nation hope. And, all throughout his film, you weren't thinking about boxing, you were focusing on the life of Braddock and what he was trying to do for his family. That's the heart of this story and why it's different than previous boxing-driven films like last year's MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Now, the boxing action in the ring was true to any other previous films, but Ron Howard was able to balance that into the story so that you were right along with Braddoock, every step of the way. It was that emotion that drove the film in and out of the ring, which is to Howard's credit and why he is becoming one of the best director's in Hollywood.<br/><br/>It's a shame that Cinderella MAN wasn't released closer to the fall, given its Oscar weighted cast and director. Taking a true story and molding it seems to be Director Ron Howard's thing these days and I would have to say he's pretty darn good at it. Unlike previous boxing flicks, this film manages to keep the focus away from the ring and produce a story that will surely have you talking days after you see it. Cinderella MAN may not be able to compete with all these other summer blockbusters when it comes to box office numbers, but those same blockbusters won't be able to hold a candle to the quality this film possesses."

"K_Molen","9","0","0","10 July 2005"," An Excellent and Suspenseful Underdog Drama
","""Cinderella Man"" is easily the best movie I've seen so far this year. It's a very well crafted film that takes its time establishing characters and setting before it launches into one of the greatest underdog stories ever told. One advice to anyone who have not seen this movie: If you do not know the story of boxer Jim Braddock (as I didn't) then do not look it up. Maybe you shouldn't even read reviews, as some have a tendency to contain spoilers when they discuss stories that the reviewer considers common knowledge. The reason I encourage you limit your knowledge of this story, is because the final 20-30 minutes of ""Cinderella Man"" are some of the most suspenseful I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a movie theater.<br/><br/>As mentioned, the beginning of the film is spent establishing and developing the characters, showing what kind of man Jim Braddock is and where his values lie, and the hardship that is affecting him and many other people during the Great Depression. There are a few moments here which some may find overly cliché filled or sentimental, but they work really well within the framework and mood of the story. Some of of these moments also serve to set up events that take place later in the film. Events which actually occurred, as per Braddock's living relatives.<br/><br/>Once characters and setting have been sufficiently established, the film goes on to tackle the boxing underdog story that got this movie made in the first place. While this part is heavier on the boxing aspect of the story, it does not leave behind what it carefully spent the first part building up. Braddock's family and neighbourhood are still playing a central part of the story, and serves as the emotional core and anchor point for the main character. It's in large part due to this very careful setup that the audience comes to care for Braddock as much as they do, which in turn serves to deepen the suspense felt during the finale.<br/><br/>It's on purpose that I've avoided describing the plot in detail. I feel that this is one of those movies which benefit from its audience knowing as little as possible about it. Instead, it's easier to say that if you are the kind of person who loves a good underdog story and who do not mind a slowly building storyline that takes its time to do it right, and who are not so cynical as to not be able to deal with sentimental storytelling, then ""Cinderella Man"" is right up your alley."

This is Ron Howards finest moment in filming. Also, this is (in my opinion) Russell Crowe's best performance.

","If you've ever heard people who grew up in the nineteen-thirties talk about hardships they either endured or witnessed, you'll notice that Cinderella MAN deals realistically with that era. Russell Crowe was born to act. Zellwegger does very well in the always-thankless role of a sports hero's wife. Jimmy Braddock's situation is compelling and the story moves along. The boxing scenes are very suspenseful. Paul Giamatti is the heart of the movie, perhaps. He's got a sense of pathos. This is an evenhanded movie with shades of ROCKY, ON THE WATERFRONT and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Clint Howard is a perfect referee.

","Good job, Ron Howard. Almost everything about this movie is good. The acting is excellent, and the screenplay is too.

So far, Cinderella Man is the best movie I've seen this year.<br/><br/>So why did I care about Jim Braddock so much? Because he's a character you don't see very much anymore--he's decent and humble. He's not about attitude, he's about character. He loves his family, but he teaches his children that there are somethings you never do, no matter how down and out you are. He shows them how to be decent by way of example, too. At the same time tough as nails, without flashing a hint of machismo. Popular opinion might presume that a character with these attributes would be boring; but he's not, because Crowe give him just the right touch of hidden confidence, humor, and homespun panache. Humble, yes--cowed, never. And here's a wild one, he loves his wife and she loves him, and without unnecessary schmaltz. And it's all done in an unaustentatious and believable way. Well, Rene Zellwiger chomps on the scenery a bit, but even that works.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man also takes you back to the day when there were actually people who didn't want the government to take care of them.

","The cell phone throwing Russell Crowe plays the underdog and lovable James J. Braddock, a boxer who is hit hard financially and emotionally by the great depression in Cinderella Man. The always brilliant Paul Giamatti (who is most deserving of a best supporting actor nod come awards season) plays Braddock's manager and friend, Joe Gould. Renee Zellweger is just as impressive as Mae Braddock, the strong-willed wife and mother. Ron Howard successfully directs this riches to rags story of the Braddock family, who once lived with luxury in a beautiful home, now scrap for food and heat as tenants of an awful ""apartment."" With the success of such boxing flicks as Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man struck me as very unique due to the underlying story of a family binding together to survive in very dangerous times. I would say only about one-third of this film is dedicated to boxing, the rest following the character's long battle with poverty (not to take away from the visually grueling boxing matches).<br/><br/>I've said this since its release in June of 2005, this films only mistake is not waiting until the fall and winter months for its release.

","I know some people can't fathom the depth of emotion this film can bring forth from viewers. Though the story is altered from the true story on which it is based, the main characters still show the pain inflicted by the depression. It shows the poverty that we think is so terrible, but is still rich compared with other nations. But mostly it shows the faith and courage that if we work hard and stick together and have integrity, opportunity will present itself. When someone poor works hard and finally has success, it is far more satisfying than success that has come easily. There is some great acting, not just by Russell Crowe, but by his trainer and his wife, and his little children. This is a great family film. I can't imagine why it would be rated ""R."" I would love to have my little children see it."
"seaview1","9","0","0","4 July 2005"," Cinderella Man Is a Crowning Achievement
","For a quarter century, director Ron Howard has shown consistent film-making prowess in a wide range of genres. In Cinderella Man, he goes back to real life (previously he did the fact-based A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13) and recreates the boxing hero, James Braddock, whose life parallels the fortunes of Depression-era New York. It is one of Howard's best films. <br/><br/>A talented boxer, Jim Braddock, ascends the ranks of boxing in the late 1920's and finds his career is jeopardized by a chance injury which cuts short any championship aspirations. Furthermore, he shows a limited boxing style that favored one arm over the other. When his boxing license is stripped and the Great Depression hits, Braddock must literally struggle to keep his family afloat as even the poorest paying jobs on the loading docks are scarce. Love and sacrifice might not be enough until a fateful opportunity comes knocking in the form of a last minute substitute in a boxing match. It seems that Braddock has become a more complete fighter by working on the docks and strengthening both of his arms. <br/><br/>What follows is an improbable series of bouts that leads to a heavyweight championship fight with Max Baer, a legendary giant. This is Braddock's second chance, and although he has everything to gain, he knows it is the biggest risk of his life; Baer has killed two opponents in the ring. Braddock becomes a symbol of hope as the nation begins to embrace him. As the whole country hangs on every punch via radio broadcast, Braddock is in the fight of his life.<br/><br/>What is basically a boxing movie is also a touching love story. You grow to understand Braddock and his wife as partners and lovers whose plight during the Depression adds resonance to the climactic bout. It is also noteworthy how the film depicts the reverence with which the populace embraced Braddock amid troubled economic times. Just as the horse, Seabiscuit, inspired a nation, so did Braddock. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator) is such a chameleon of an actor; he seems to effortlessly embody this legendary fighter by demonstrating tremendous physical abilities in the boxing ring while maintaining focus as the everyman who has to live by his wits. Not only did Crowe severely trim down in weight and train to be a convincing fighter (he looks to be in incredible condition), he effortlessly inflects a New Jersey accent and inhabits a proud family man whose love for his wife and three children is matched only by his heart and desire in the boxing ring.<br/><br/>Renée Zellweger (Cold Mountain and Chicago) does a serviceable job as Braddock's wife, Mae. A better written character would have given the actress more to work with. Her shining moment comes during a fateful meeting with Max Baer at a posh restaurant where she more than holds her own. Paul Giamatti (Sideways and American Splendor) takes his role as Braddock's trainer and owns it. He breathes three-dimensional life into what could have been a cardboard, supporting role. Particularly in the last fight, he gives Braddock advice and suggestions to the point you actually believe he knows what he is talking about. It is surely an Oscar caliber performance. <br/><br/>There is a subplot involving Braddock's friend from the docks named Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine) who is involved in soliciting union support which culminates in violence in Hooverville. It would have been interesting to have explored this world a bit more, but instead, it is given relatively short shrift. One minor controversy is the portrayal of Baer (Craig Bierko is quite menacing) as an unsympathetic brute of a fighter which was probably done to contrast him with Braddock. Also unfortunate is the timing of the film's release on the heels of a sleeper like Million Dollar Baby which surely invited comparisons in subject matter and Oscar pedigree. <br/><br/>Kudos go to the production staff for vividly reconstructing the period as costumers and set decorators reimagine a dark period of history. The infamous tents and shacks that became Hooverville are depicted faithfully. The film never drags or seems padded. It is as lean as Crowe. The boxing scenes are well shot and edited in a refreshing way. It is so easy to fall into clichés, but these fights are staged with great care and realism. When the punches connect, there are stunningly brief, close-up frames of the impact. Howard also employs split second flashback imagery to illustrate Braddock's thought processes whether it be the funeral of a close friend or remembrance of a small apartment without heat or electricity. Editing transitions are done with good effect. <br/><br/>Ron Howard (working off a well written screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman) does such a good job that the film doesn't feel like it is being directed but rather, it feels like it just happens as in real life. While not quite as good as A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man is a well made film about an amazing comeback story with real life people that gets better as it goes along until its gutsy ending."

","Boxing movies have been around for a while. The Rocky collection of movies really kicked things off for the genre. Raging Bull came after and Ali followed suit. All have great stories and show what it means to be a contender. Each has they're own style that works. Ali had intense fighting scenes and Rocky utilized the montage to perfection. Director Ron Howard has expanded on the genre again.<br/><br/>Howard's Cinderella Man starring Russell Crowe as the boxer Jimmy Braddock is one of his best films so far. With great acting and a story that really hits home, movie goers will not be disappointed. Crowe's performance is breathtaking as the working man's fighter. His Jersey accent and presence on screen is astounding. His acting is complemented with his leading lady Mae played by Renee Zellweger. The chemistry between these two shows real compassion during what is one of the darkest times in US history, the Great Depression.<br/><br/>Braddock is trying to find work and a fight with the help of his trainer Joe Gould, played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti. Gould isn't a rich man but he doesn't do too badly either. He supports Braddock whenever he is in trouble. He gives him a knock about something else to take his mind off of something troubling. These two men will ultimately be apart of one of them most inspiring and compelling stories in all of sports. of Braddock's rise back to the top has left its mark on the boxing world forever.<br/><br/>Along with great acting comes great film making. The cinematography especially, during the fights, is extremely realistic. Sometimes it feels like the audience is taking the punches. Outside the ring Howard uses a lot of symbolism to convey the feelings and emotions only those who lived through the Great Depression could feel. Stealing wood from a fence just to heat your home is one of the desperate measures taken by the Braddock family.<br/><br/>The score is impressive as well. Thomas Newman (Road to Perdition) mixes period music with the music Newman composed for the movie, depending on the situation, to emphasize the emotion Howard tries to pass onto the audience.<br/><br/>What Howard creates isn't just a boxing movie. He paints a portrait of a man who is feared by bigger, stronger men and loved by people of all creeds and upbringings. Jim Braddock is a great person to look up to for inspiration and with the world the way it is, everyone can use a hero. That's what made Braddock so likable. He struggled to support his family during the Great Depression, just like everyone else. He fought not only for his family and his dignity, but for every hard worker out there. They wanted they're man to win. Howard, along with the great cast, have brought a legend back to life."

","Russel Crowe was outstanding. He really brought this character to life. The visual look at how far this family fell during the depression was incredible. We today have no idea what our parents & grandparents went through. Ron Howard really brought this to home with the lines outside the shipyards & the lines waiting to get go on the dole. Excellent job! The only thing I was disappointed in was Renee. She looked a bit too Roxie Heart to me. In the beginning that was all I could see & hear. She made me think of that character. I did think however that she & Russell have good chemistry together. I however was more focused on his character throughout the film. I also was impressed with the kids. They did a great job playing off the parents. I believe Russell as the parent more than Renee.<br/><br/>I also was very impressed with Paul Giamatti's character. He played the rich hustler/promoter very well. It was a shock to find that he was essentially as poor as the Braddocks. You could tell he really believed in Braddock.<br/><br/>Bruce McGill was very compelling as the rich promoter. He played the jerk very well.<br/><br/>My favorite part in the film was when Braddock went to Johnston & the rest of the rich promoters begging for money to put the electricity back on. It really showed the lack of empathy on the part of the people who had against the people who didn't.<br/><br/>The only other part I was unsure of was the Max Baer character. Was he really so brash & mean? I kind of looked at this as the way boxers are. Look at the way Mahommad Ali & Mike Tyson have acted when trying to promote fights.<br/><br/>Good film - great fight - great suspense....."

","When I first went to see this film, all that I knew about it was that it starred Russell Crowe and it was based around the life of a boxer. Of course, it ended up being much more complicated than that.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is James Braddock, a boxer rising up from the bottom in 1930's New York City, during the peak of the Great Depression. After several fights (including one in which he breaks his hand and loses his boxing license), Braddock attempts to get financial assistance and he and his wife are in danger of having to send their children away due to the fact that they may not be able to support them in such a difficult time. However, Braddock is offered (even after his loss-of-license) yet a chance for one more fight for $250... he not only wins the fight and the money, but he is propelled back into the dramatic world of boxing (not to mention the betting/gambling based upon its fights) and media spotlight. He eventually rises to the top and finally becomes the prime opponent for the current world heavyweight boxing champion, Max Baer. Renee Zellweger does an excellent job as playing the reluctant wife-of-a-celebrity and caring mother of several starving children.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was great. It was much better than my other favorite boxing film, ""Undisputed"", and it was, to put it simply, a masterpiece that made you feel as though you were on the frontline of the boxing matches and gambling scene of the 1930's. While it could get boring at times and was somewhat long, this was still a great film that I recommend with pleasure to all. Please feel free to email me with any questions or comments..."

"Deckard-16","10","0","0","26 June 2005"," Another knockout for Howard and Crowe
","As much as I love APOLLO 13 I have to say that this may be Ron Howard's best film yet. Cinderella MAN is that rare adult-aimed film that you can take your kids and grandmother to see (like APOLLO 13 for that matter). It is a warm and vibrant film that earns in heart-in-your-throat moments with some vivid depictions of The Great Depression and very exciting boxing scenes. I think Russell Crowe is the best actor working right now because he disappears into a role and becomes it like DeNiro did when he made films for art and not $$$. James Braddock's story is more compelling than Rocky Balboa's because his fairy tale was true. Crowe makes this uncomplicated good guy really interesting which is almost a miracle in itself. This a guy you honestly root for (forgive me Australia) and Crowe and Howard never telegraph their intentions. BUT they also have the talents of Paul Giamatti (better here than he ever has been) and Renee Zellweger in key supporting roles. And let's not forget Craig Bierko as Max Baer who makes a ""bad guy"" 3-D. I don't really like boxing (that b-tch Tyson still owes me $35 for that Holyfield rip-off and I hope you read this you vicious thug quitter), but now Cinderella MAN comes on the heals of MILLION DOLLAR BABY (which the Oscars got right) within a year and you gotta wonder when Don Kings dies maybe the sport can revive itself like it has on screen.

","Braddock lost everything because of injuries and 1929. He didn't take it out on his family, or society or look for scapegoats. He got a second chance, culminating in a title shot in 1935, as a long shot (apparently 10-1). At about the same time, F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote ""There are no second acts in American lives"" (ironically, Fitzgerald was only considered ""great"" posthumously). The film ""Dogville"" proposed an America whose ""true"" ugliness would be exposed by poverty. www.nydailynews.com has reprinted some of its 1935 articles about the fight, including one that depicted a different America: ""Braddock has been kicked around. He has been down and out on relief, and all but counted out in the game of life.

","The screening I went to in mid-May 2005 was attended with great anticipation by a mixed demographic in downtown Minneapolis. Graced with an award winning cast (Russell Crowe, René Zellweger, Paul Giamatti), CINDERALLA MAN is clearly a film made with great care by master producers (Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Penny Marshall), director (Ron Howard), and screenwriters (Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman). And yet, when the film ended, I had the sinking feeling that this pedigreed and worthy film was going to be a box office disappointment. Often billed as SEABISCUIT with two legs, this film indeed is a similar inspirational tale about how individual conviction and perseverance can prevail against overwhelming odds to emerge victorious, just as we and our Nation survived the depths of the Great Depression. In this case, the character of the man that was Jim Braddock, his unwavering support by a manager and wife who believed in him, were finely drawn and superbly executed by exceptional actors. The journey of the man, his tenacious hold to personal and professional principles, could not have been depicted better. The boxing action shots, the set design, the deft outline of Braddock's adversaries  poverty and physical danger  were clear and convincing. Despite all this, my concern at the end of the movie was that it was depressing, rather than uplifting. It went so deep that I was emotionally washed out at the end and even a good ending didn't make me right. Perhaps it has a little to do with my personal concern with the present American economy that made me wonder if the Great Depression could ever happen again, and what if it did. I knew it wasn't a film I'd be recommending to my friends for a fun evening out. The other concern I had while watching the film, was that I didn't know enough about this man Braddock and his family during the good days. The film opens with Braddock a winner, and very shortly thereafter the black clouds roll in and the majority of the movie is the dark story about a man from whom we have no expectation who turns out to be a great man. Perhaps it would have been good to spend a little more time showing us how Braddock first made it to the top, and how he became a little cocky, and then how he weathered the great storm with principles intact despite being severely tested. If any fault can be given at all to the design of the story telling, this would be it -- That short shrift was given to background on Braddock, his little human failings and his relationship with his wife, before their mettle was tested."

As if this story and the way it was told weren't enough, the movie is spectacular to look at, and the acting jobs are transcendent, particularly Paul Giamatti, who takes a simple role and infuses it with something riveting. Russell Crowe, who I've never liked, is fantastic, and Renee Zellweger is, well, Renee Zellweiger. Nothing beats a story that should be told when it is told really well.

And since Brando said those fateful words in the back of a car in On the Waterfront, ""I coulda been a contender!"", boxing has been the all-American sport. Some will argue that baseball rules the cinema as the ""American"" ballgame. but boxing is the clear winner. What could be more American? Fans, gamblers, moms, dads, bookies and all surround a small roped-off area where two specimens of the American Dream beat the fleshy pulp out of each other until one of them drops, out cold upon the mat. And with Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger at the helm of a 30's depression era backdrop, director Ron Howard has used this love of the underdog and love of the sport to form this all-American formula that fuels his Cinderella Man. <br/><br/>I must admit, initially I was skeptical of this film. Because, come on, we've all seen this film before. But wait! That's where I was wrong, kind of. The formula's still there, pumping away each frame of the film, but Ron Howard manages to transcend the formula and make Cinderella Man more than its underdog story of an aging boxer. In fact, many of the best scenes don't involve the sport at all. Cinderella Man succeeds in that it's a story of a man struggling to keep his family above water, struggling to keep his dignity, and doing it the only way he can. <br/><br/>The film opens at the end of James Braddock's (Russell Crowe) first reign in the boxing world. His coach, Jim Gould (Paul Giamatti), has placed him in a fight that gives him the chance to increase his purse back up to $75 per match. The increase in pay would do wonders for the state of living his family has degraded to. His wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger), and his three kids live in an apartment in Jersey with the overdue bills have piled up. Unfortunately, James loses his match in the most embarrassing of ways. It's so bad that his license to fight is revoked. To make matters worse, his right hand's been broken, making his sporadic shifts at the docks a fight to keep his injury hidden. But the injury turns out to be something of a blessing. Because he can't use his right hand, James strengthens up what's usually his weak arm in the ring, making him a brutal force with both hands. A few months later, after having to send the kids off to live at a relative's house, Gould offers James one more fight. He doesn't have the license back, it's just a one night stand in the ring. To the surprise of everyone, even himself, Braddock wins the fight, making headline news and starting the uphill battle for the sport yet again. <br/><br/>The problem with Cinderella Man is that if you've seen the preview you know the story of the film up until the climax. From there, you can figure out the ending based simply on the title. It's no secret. But that's not the point of Cinderella Man. The point is in studying the character of James Braddock. There's great humanity in his story. Howard smartly decides to steer the story away from boxing and focus mainly on the family's interaction with the time period. And the time period Howard creates is nothing less than flawless. <br/><br/>Cinderella Man is of course set in the American Depression era, with all but a lucky few down on their luck and struggling to keep a decent lifestyle. Howard emphasizes this lifestyle with a great visual style that borders on Film Noir. There's a gorgeous, most memorable shot, where the boxing ring is lit by a spotlight from afar in the far left side of frame. Surrounding the ring are dimly lit droves of people, all seeming to crush closer and closer to the ring. On the right side of shot, strikingly close, is the silhouette of a common man in a hat and suit, watching the show as the audience is, completely entranced. It's this sort of dramatic time period visuals that fuels the emotional power of the film. <br/><br/>And completely entranced is what we are throughout the film. Because between the story of Braddock's home life, we're treated to some true achievements in boxing film. Particularly the final fight brings us to the very edge of our seat. And even knowing how the film will end, Howard still manages to keep us on our toes, sweating and twitching in our seat like Braddock's coach Joe Gould beside the ring. <br/><br/>By the end of the film we feel satisfied. It's a feel-good film, but not in the cheesy way Miracle was last years. It's feel-good in that we feel alright leaving Braddock to return to his family in Jersey, knowing he's got the cash in his pocket to pay the bills and his dignity still holed up inside. Howard has brought us through Braddock's most important time of his life and immersed us in it through brilliant direction, great acting, and a screenplay worthy of awards. As I said before, Howard successfully transcends the formula that originally bound him. -Sam Osborn of www.samseescinema.com"

","This film is really great. Most striking is the faithful representation of the Depression era, and the feelings that went with it. I attribute this mostly to the historian Suzanne Wasserman who greatly contributed to this film as a historical consultant. It was also a good job by Ron Howard. He is the man. Akiva Goldsman did a decent job with the screen play. Russell Crowe was pretty good and Harvey Pekar, i mean Paul Giamatti was also excellent. Everything after the words ""historical consultant"" was just filler because this had to be ten lines long. I probably shouldn't have just said that. O my god I have to add even more lines. But it's OK because i feel its so important to let the world know about Suzanne Wasserman's contribution. She is a historian for the Gotham Center for New York City History."

","I must say, I was anticipating this movie very much. This movie was quite simply brilliant. It captivated me from the very start, emotionally as well as spiritually as it portrayed the perseverance of the human heart. This movie will leave you breathless and trust me, u want to see it in the theater. Don't wait until the DVD comes out. If u do, u will be missing out. Russel Crowe puts on a performance that is second to none in this fine piece of art that will undoubtedly acclaim some sort of award in the future. It may seem that Crowe is on a real hot streak, as he further cements his Hollywood ""a-list"" status with yet another gripping yet harrowing tale of a man's passion.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away about this movie, however I can say that this movie is not predictable at all, well maybe a little if you don't watch a lot of movies. But if you are a seasoned buff the things that you have become accustomed to seeing in these sorts of films is totally twisted away.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have about this film is that at the end they should've showed a photo of the real life man him self with a date of birth to death. Other than that none at all."

","Cinderella Man starts with a quote saying that the story of Jim Braddock is the most amazing story in all of boxing. By the end of the film, this is self-evident. This is a wonderful film. You would have to be very cynical to not feel empathy towards the characters and feel moved by their struggles.<br/><br/>That being said, there are a few problems with the film. The first is that it provides very little historical context. The film starts when boxer Braddock (a pitch-perfect performance by Russell Crowe, who seems born and bred in New Jersey) is at his peak, never getting knocked down in the ring and earning enough money to live comfortably with his family. It then cuts to four years later, after the depression has hit and he has become a failure, losing matches to the point where he is disbarred. He is now living in a small, drafty apartment. You overhear that he started losing matches and hasn't been able to book a fight, but for a while, it takes some time to get orientated in his new life, four years after his success.<br/><br/>Later on in the film, a crisis involving his friend Mike Wilson and a ""Hooverville"" shantytown in Central Park also fails to provide context. It is unclear what happened in the park, how involved Wilson was in it, and who Wilson even really was. He goes from almost beating his wife in one scene to supporting Braddock as though nothing ever happened in the next. We understand Braddock's values, but not Wilson's. Was he a communist? Unclear. Did he cause the riot in the park? Was it even a riot? The movie doesn't explain this well, and nothing is done with the subplot, expect to suggest that it's hard to lose loved ones, especially during the depression. But like the starting quote, this is pretty self-evident.<br/><br/>The other major problem with the film is in its depiction of Max Baer. True, in real life he was flamboyant, but was also deeply grieved by the deaths of the men he killed in the ring. In the film he makes sexist and offensive comments to Braddock in the ring and in a restaurant, which turns the final scenes in a way that's false in comparison to what came before them. Braddock fights because he wants to know that they have a say in their life and that he can make things better for his family. The most powerful scenes in the film involve the hits to Braddock's pride (having to go on welfare, begging his friends for money, not being able to provide for his family), not the hits to his face. But when it comes time for Braddock to face Baer in the ring, the way Baer is depicted turns the outcome to our wanting to see this offensive man punished by the moral Braddock. We want to see Baer get eaten when we should want to see Braddock get fed.<br/><br/>In the classic film Rocky, Rocky wants to go the distance to prove he's not a bum, the same way Braddock wants to have control over his life. But in Rocky, it almost doesn't matter if he wins or loses so long as he proves something to himself. In Cinderella Man, it matters who wins, and it shouldn't. The film would be more powerful if Baer, like the electrician who had to do his job and turn off Braddock's electricity so he didn't become unemployed too, was portrayed as a decent, or at least more complex, character. If he didn't want to hurt Braddock, but knew he had to do everything he could to keep getting fights- and more money. Even if this meant hurting a good person like Braddock. The film is moving because it shows people doing things they have to do but don't want to: begging, stealing, turning off someone's power. It is not moving because an obnoxious character is defeated.<br/><br/>These faults do not detract from the film as a whole, though. It is wonderfully acted by the entire cast. It is beautifully shot, with all the period details exact. Director Ron Howard is wise in not forcing the emotions. When Braddock's wife, played by Renée Zellweger, learns that Baer killed two men in the ring, the film simply regards her as she processes this information, begins to fear for her husband, while trying to keep her composure. This is much better than her knowing about Baer from the start, and only deciding to stand by her husband in the end. Also notice the way Crowe plays the scene where he asks for money from his former friends. He's ashamed of what he has to do, but too proud to not do it and send the kids away. Watching him try and keep his dignity is far more powerful than it would be if he broke down and cried over his bad fortune.<br/><br/>Even though the film ends happily, it is draining. It is rare that the movies give us a character that is as completely deserving of a happy ending as Braddock. He struggles through the whole film, and the audience struggles with him. And if you have kids or ever had to take a blow to your pride, it just makes the film that much more powerful.<br/><br/>It's nice to walk out of a movie and not feel guilty about going to see it. I doubt that anyone other than the most cynical would walk out of Cinderella Man and regret going to see it. The only thing I felt guilty about was that I could go home to a house filled with food and warmth, a luxury denied to Jim Braddock. And he never even complained about it."

","This really gets an 8.5.<br/><br/>1970 = ROCKY 1980 = Raging Bull 1990 = Well there was...umm...Play it to the bone 2000 = Cinderella Man<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is excellent as a down on his luck boxer. Unfortunately he seems to still be in character (lol). The movie opened to low sales ($18M, 2M below minimum expectations), but it is definitely a movie worth seeing. The setting (as for most movies set in the depression-era) shows the gravity of the 1930's economy on the common man (and well off joe as well). <br/><br/>The scenes with the children and Renee Z (who i do not usually like) were heartbreaking. JJ Braddock's story is an amazing one indeed. His courage in the face of overwhelming odds was inspirational. Crowe's comes close to perfection getting 8.5, only because he is not the first to play this type of character.<br/><br/>The entire movie is stolen by Paul Giamatti, who plays the booky. He is of course why the movie goes from simply a boxing movie with great fight shots to an excellent boxing movie with great fights shots and believable characters. He brings the best out of both Crowe and Zellweger.<br/><br/>The man should absolutely be nominated for best supporting actor (at the Oscars, not just the GGlobes). He is the supporting actor you always see and say ""I know that guy...what is his name?""<br/><br/>Notable Films: Singles, Negotiator, Duets, Confidence (see this movie)<br/><br/>PS. Did Max Baer actually fight with no defense and only hay-makers?"

","Fresh on the heels of the recent release and Academy Award victory of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"", comes yet another boxing movie, which like the latter title, more than just showcases the dynamics of the sport, but also takes a jab at the human elements of hardship, sacrifice, determination and ambition. The physical action taking place within the ring, almost serves as a metaphor to the inner battles confronted by the title character.<br/><br/>Directed by Ron Howard, the film depicts the true-life story of boxer Jim Braddock as he fought his way out from a depression-torn existence, which not only impacted himself but the entire nation as well, as he became both a role model and savior to everyone who followed his plight.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe stars as Jim, a successful contender and loyal family man who becomes disqualified from the boxing ring due to a hand injury. This can't come at a worst time as the city of New York is gripped by overwhelming unemployment and poverty. With a wife and three children to provide for, he is forced to move from a cozy home to a ramshackle ""hole in the wall"". Jim heads out to the docks everyday, in the hopes of putting in a day's labor which would ensure continuing income and food on the table. But job positions are sparse, and Jim's family sinks even deeper into financial ruins.<br/><br/>One of the most effective and stirring scenes occurs when Jim, setting aside his pride and dignity, wanders into a room and tearfully pleads for a handout, so that his family can survive that much longer. The ensuing reception he receives is both unexpected and heartwarming.<br/><br/>Becoming increasingly more despondent, Jim asks his manager (Paul Giamatti) for a second chance to return to the ring, and reluctantly, he is offered a deal. From there, we see him evolve from low-paying fights, until he finally reaches the prize winning title, a title that comes at too high a cost. It turns out that Jim must compete against Max Baer (Craig Bierko), an arrogant womanizer, who has become infamous for having already killed two men in the ring. Despite many people's warnings and misgivings, Jim still remains determined to risk it all.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger turns in a solid performance as Mae, Jim's reluctant yet supportive wife. Her anguish and worry over her husband's safety is very apparent, and you truly find yourself relating to her turmoil and anxiety during the course of the final fight.<br/><br/>The children are good without having to rely on overacting or being too cutesy, and it was a good choice to cast relative ""unknowns"" rather than resorting to more conventional, Hollywood-manufactured child stars.<br/><br/>I admit to never being much of a fan of Russell Crowe, nor have I ever bothered to see any of his previous films, perhaps due to his oft reported personal disposition, or simply due to ignorant prejudice on my part. Whatever the reasons may be, I must praise his performance in this instance. He masterfully embodied the essence of Jim Braddock. His gentleness and soft-spoken manner blended perfectly with his strong reserve and physical strength, combining together to create a perfect display of loyalty and perseverance.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an uplifting film which gets its audience involved throughout each the physical and emotional sequences, with a mixture of both cheers and tears."

","I went to this movie not to sure how it would be mainly due to its title. As the end credits rolled I sat in my seat for a few minutes enthralled by what I had just watched. This movie is by far the ""feel good movie of the year"" I'm convinced it will win Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Director. This is truly Ron Howard at the top of his game. There are no words to explain how truly inspiring and uplifting this movie is. I could honestly feel the different emotions that the actors and actress portrayed during the entire film. After seeing this picture, I am really looking forward to the next Academy Awards. Can't wait for the DVD!!!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. We all know Ron Howard is a master of melodrama and sometimes lays it on bit heavy. While ""Cinderella Man"" is no exception, the sappy moments are few and are fully offset by the beauty and grace and power of the movie. This is expert film-making and ""Cinderella Man"" immediately jumps to the top of the best film of 2005 list.<br/><br/>While Howard does a tremendous job of capturing the depression era and the hardships that so many families faced, what may be most impressive is the captivating performances he obtains from the stellar cast. Russell Crowe is pure gold as folk hero and boxing champ James J. Braddock. Crowe commands the screen and his quiet strength makes him perfect for this good and heroic figure. This is the first film since ""Jerry Maguire"" that I have not found Renee Zellweger to be over the top and annoying. A tip of the cap to Howard for inducing a more subdued performance from her. Great to see Paddy Considine (so wonderful as Johnny in ""In America"") in a meaningful role as Braddock's buddy. Howard also works in his dad, Rance (as ring announcer) and brother Clint (as referee) in what has become a family tradition. The casting of Craig Bierko as Max Baer was brilliant as he is frightening as the hard-hitting (and future father of Jethro Bodine!) heavyweight fighter. Not sure exactly what to say about Paul Giamatti. He wreaks greatness as Braddock's longtime loyal manager. Giamatti will no doubt garner much discussion for a Best Supporting nomination for next year's Oscars. This role is well-written and multi-faceted and Giamatti brings a wonderful spirit to the film.<br/><br/>Many already know how the real life story ends, but as with Howard's ""Apollo 13"", that in no way distracts from the power of the story or the film. Ron Howard has two upcoming high-profile project: ""The DaVinci Code"" and a remake of ""East of Eden"". He could easily secure his place in Hollywood history if he delivers on those films in the same manner he delivers here."

","The faith. The power of believing in all that can be. The fight, one for the family and one for the people in the struggle. Cinderella man is a true fairy tale story. They are inspiring to us as we grow old and they remain so. I'm not a big fan of Russell Crowe although I did enjoy Gladiator, but in this movie he truly moved me. The chemistry between him and Renee Zellwegger was beautiful and complete. Watching it was an amazing experience by itself. The theater was full and so my friend and I had to sit in distant seats. During all boxing scenarios, when Russell Crowe was fighting, we would cover our eyes with our hands and repeatedly say: ""no, no, no"", not wanting to take part in any bloody scene. It was very girlishly ridiculous. At the very last scene we endured the fight and we were literally screaming in the movies: ""YES! KILL HIM"" At the end of the movie everyone applauded. I don't know why I'm saying thisit was just cool, I guess. For anybody out there reaching for a goal, miracles do happen. The fight is long and the difficulties may be great but if you don't give up on yourself and ""keep your hands up"", eventually you will find enough within to win."

The touching story makes you ache for those that suffered through the great depression while the final fight leaves you tensed at the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe puts forth another Oscar worthy performance while Renee Zellweger exhibits why she is currently one of the hottest stars in Hollywood. However, the unexpected surprise is Paul Giamatti's portrayal of Jim Braddock's trainer, Joe Gould, which is more than on par with the two Tinseltown heavyweights and may even getting him an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>There are few movies that provoke an audience to holler and applause and Cinderella Man does that and more and when the viewers did, for once it didn't irritate me.<br/><br/>A must see."

","Very, very good film that goes way beyond the usual ""underdog triumphs against the odds"" story. What really elevates the film is its visceral depiction of the Great Depression. I've noted that some reviewers have commented that the first part of the film, before Jim Braddock starts his boxing comeback, seemed slow to them. How can this be? You're watching a destitute family struggling to survive surrounded by others just like them. While the fight scenes were great in their depiction of a brutal reality, Ron Howard succeeds in portraying the struggles of the Braddock family as another brutal reality.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Crowe, Zellwegger and Giamatti provide the usual high-quality performances we've come to expect, but I wanted to give a special mention to Craig Bierko as Max Baer. Maybe this performance will elevate him out of screen acting's second-tier, because he is snarlingly, arrogantly great."

In today's vernacular, it's all good.<br/><br/>Squeamish on boxing's impact on the human body? Look away. The film is too good to miss based on that alone.<br/><br/>This film is in ""The Natural"" (R Redford) class, with enough great one-liners that'll have devotees quoting them as they liberally do from the Godfather franchise.

","I was excited to see this movie because I thought that Russel Crowe was going to wear a pretty gown and finally meet his prince charming, instead Paul Giamatti groomed him a lot while he trudged around with a long face and dull glassy eyes and pretended that he walked upright. While normally I think that watching boxing is right up there with golf and nascar this film elevated its boxing sequences to a new level of boredom making them something akin to curling. Similar to Seabiscuit, Cinderella Man is an inspiration movie about a hero that uplifted the American spirit during the Great Depression. And what I mean by similar is exactly. Exactly like Seabiscuit. In fact this movie should have been titled, Seabiscuit Fights Craig Bierko. I swear the same guy was doing the announcing and they may have even used the same score and was it just me or did anyone else see Chris Cooper hiding in the back of the gym. If these movies have taught me anything its that the Great Depression wasn't so bad. I mean sure no one had anything to eat but with great heroes, like boxers and horses, to look up to American could thrive on the inspirational music that would swell as yet another underdog beats the odds and succeeds in a stupid violet sport tailored perfectly to make rich men richer and poor shlubs loose money gambling.

One feels the hardships of the depression. The desperation of the families and the hopelessnes of unemployment. Russel Crow's method acting pays out with the mannerism of a real boxer. The actor who plays Max Bear steals the show. Boxing will always have Mike Tysons, and Mr T. Max Bear is a nasty in love with himself boxer. Reminds the viewer of Creed in Rocky with the same ring behaviour, except a bit meaner. I do not want to ruin the film by revealing more of the story. Watch C man in the movie theater. a first film to watch on rental night. 8 out of 10. I will buy this film"

","""Cinderella Man"" is a really, really good movie that will work flawlessly for many viewers.<br/><br/>It's just short of being a great film, though.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" tells a true and remarkable story, and it tells it well. It aims for tears and cheers and it earns both.<br/><br/>Russel Crowe, as Depression-era boxer James Braddock, is his usual charismatic, handsome, masculine presence, and a fine actor. There isn't anyone else like him out there among English-speaking American / British / Aussie / Kiwi actors. He alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti, as fight manager Joe Gould, is brilliant, as one would expect.<br/><br/>Craig Bierko, as a swaggering, sexily satanic Max Baer, is as scary and fun to watch as Darth Vader was in the first ""Star Wars."" Director Ron Howard seems to be trying to film fights in a whole new way, trying to top films like Martin Scorcese's ""Raging Bull."" He does a really good job.<br/><br/>So, what's not to like in a movie this good? <br/><br/>* Women. This movie caters to its male viewers. That's not a bad thing, but it made this female viewer waiting for a depth that the movie could not deliver.<br/><br/>The film makes clear that Russel Crowe / James Braddock, single-handedly carries the whole world on his shoulders. He sacrifices his breakfast so that his daughter may eat. He humiliates himself in front of his former peers so he can pay the electric bill. Etc.<br/><br/>How did his wife Mae, Renee Zellweger, spend the Depression? Whining, nagging, and otherwise doing not much of anything.<br/><br/>She mentions in passing that she takes in sewing, but this throwaway comment is easily missed, and gives Mae no life.<br/><br/>Zellweger is a Kewpie Doll here trying to express the gravitas of a wife and mother. She fails. She comes across as grating; her dark helmet-style hair emphasizes her lack of appeal.<br/><br/>My teeth were on edge throughout her scenes.<br/><br/>Love between James and Mae is meant to be a centerpiece of the movie and Braddock's motivation; Crowe communicates his love; Zellweger never conveys that she is his worthy mate.<br/><br/>There's actually a scene where Mae and Mrs. Joe Gould sit down and say to each other, paraphrase, ""Men do everything and we do nothing."" Well, thanks for pointing that out.<br/><br/>That's not how the women in my family spent the Depression, but that's what the movie wants us to believe, and that failure to acknowledge women as full human beings cheats the movie.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" would have been a much better movie if it, like other boxing films, mated its male lead, through the script and through casting, with a worthy partner. Think of Eva Marie Saint opposite Marlon Brando in ""On the Waterfront,"" Talia Shire opposite Sly Stallone in ""Rocky,"" Lili Palmer opposite John Garfield in ""Body and Soul."" <br/><br/>* Murky Cinematography. People living a long time ago looked as crisp and clear to each other as we do today; they didn't look like antique, stained, sepia photographs. Howard tries to make the movie look ""old"" and this just makes it look murky.<br/><br/>* More background. ""Seabiscuit"" erred on the other side, adding too much expository prose about the history of the Depression. ""Cinderella Man"" didn't tell us enough. In one scene, Braddock is a wealthy man, a home-owner, with his own driver. In the next, he is living in an unheated hovel.<br/><br/>I know that this is a historical reality, and yet the movie never made me believe it.<br/><br/>There is a character, Mike, who seems to be a bit of an anarchist who apparently dies in a Hooverville, but this is never made clear or interesting, which is too bad.<br/><br/>One final note: boxing matches make up a lot of the running time of this movie. If you are the type who needs to look away when two characters on screen are pummeling each other into bloody wads of flesh, you may end up not seeing a lot of this movie."
"sjmcollins-1","6","2","5","6 June 2005"," Great fight scenes, too many sappy moments
","Renee Zellweger almost succeeds in ruining Cinderella Man, the Ron Howardization of former heavyweight champion James J. Braddock's life. Russell Crowe gives a solid performance as the champ, but the script left no room for any blemish on Braddock's character, and the Irish saint thing really begins to wear thin by the third act, as Braddock is practically deified by his adoring Depression-era public. Zellwegger is the worst of the lot, sapping up each scene she's in as Braddock begins his comeback. It seems in the beginning of the film that she has no problem with Braddock's career, but turns on a dime when Jim announces his return to the ring. All the schmaltz aside though, the fight scenes themselves are fantastic. You can tell that Howard really did his homework on the old fight films and got everything down right. These scenes are the soul of the film, but I didn't get any Rocky-like chills due to the pandering nature of the film to tug at your heart strings."
"pennquaker08","7","2","5","4 June 2005"," A good, but flawed, film.
","Having just seen ""Cinderella Man,"" I am left with mixed feelings; there are things that I absolutely loved, but then again also an equal number of things that just disappointed me. Granted, I was not looking forward to seeing this film; from the trailer, it looked as if it were going to be a hackneyed, contrived hankie-wringer aimed solely at the heartstrings of Oscar voters and grandmothers. Now, having seen the film, this preconceived notion is both corroborated in some ways and dispelled in others. Let me proceed first with the latter.<br/><br/>First: Paul Giamatti is outstanding. I can definitely see a well-deserved Best Supporting Actor nod for him here as Russell Crowe's longtime manager and coach. In my opinion, he is the very best aspect of this film. His accent is dead-on (more about accents later, with respect to Ms. Zellweger especially), his execution is layered and nuanced without ever bringing his motives into question--he took what could have been a very one-dimensional character and truly brought him to life.<br/><br/>Also, Mr. Crowe has turned in yet another excellent performance as the titular Runyonesque fighter, James J. Braddock. His tremendous chemistry with all of his colleagues truly brings a close ensemble feel to what otherwise might have been perceived as a loosely-drawn bunch of Depression-era ragamuffins. His rapport not only with Mr. Giamatti (which at first may seem like an unlikely pairing turns out to be spot-on) and also with the children--and even the insufferable Renee Zellweger--truly lends the sympathy that is so essential to successful execution of this film. Although this may not be as complex a role as John Nash, or even dare say Jeffrey Wigand, he still, much in the vein of Mr. Giamatti, pulls off an excellent deepening of the film's protagonist.<br/><br/>The film truly centers around the fight scenes, which I found to be expertly choreographed, shot and edited. They were, much like those in ""Raging Bull"" and, more recently, ""Million Dollar Baby,"" extraordinarily involving. Do not be surprised if you find yourself throwing small punches in your seat as you watch these thoroughly immersing and lavishly entertaining sequences--not only great for the action itself, but also for the brilliant interplay between Mr. Crowe and Mr. Giamatti, hearkening images of De Niro and Pesci some 25 years ago.<br/><br/>Finally, the overall film-making itself is top notch. Ron Howard, ever the picture of a well-polished storyteller is in his usual good form. Although the direction itself sometimes seems to range from heavily-involved and moving (the fight scenes) to distant and sluggish (the non-fight scenes--to be discussed in a moment), his hands are certainly some of the most competent in the business for delivering such a large-scale film while still retaining artistic credibility (not mentioning any recent sandal-and-toga epics.) However, the time has now come to examine some of the films pitfalls. First, the writing is stilted and, except during the fight scenes, rather false-sounding. The dialogue--especially Ms. Zellweger's--sounds as if she had written herself crib notes a few minutes before she prepared to say anything and then snuck a peek at them when the time came to whine whatever it is that she wanted to say. Coming from a tried-and-true--and Academy Award-winning--writer of the ilk of Akiva Goldsman, I expect more out of such a script.<br/><br/>However, the film's principal problem is not the writing, but rather every scene that takes place outside of a boxing arena--i.e. every scene including Ms. Zellweger. These copious exhibitions of Mr. Braddock's unflappable integrity and love for his family, even in spite of the squalor in which they lived, were very nice, but truly dragged the pace of this film to a grinding halt. These lumbering scenes, which endeavored so to have dramatic weight and impact, only left the viewer looking at his/her watch until the next fight scene came. But, of course, they were necessary; they just felt so stagy which, of course, is perfectly fine if performed on a stage, but cinema is a medium in which actions are magnified thousandfold over live theater and, as such, steps must be taken to compensate. The film's ""dramatic"" scenes simply have a heavy flamboyance to them that screams for much-needed dilution.<br/><br/>And now the unfortunate time has come to examine the absolute worst aspect of this film, Ms. Renee Zellweger, as Mr. Braddock's long-suffering wife Mae. I cannot understand the fame that Ms. Zellweger has managed to accrue for herself in light of her inability to deliver any sort of dramatic integrity to her roles. She comes off as a puckered, whining nag who, for the strong performance of Mr. Crowe, is simply eclipsed, leaving the viewer asking the question of why such a big-name actress was needed for such an overshadowed role (which I am convinced was blown up exponentially in order to give Ms. Zellweger screen time)? Not only is the rhythm with which she speaks distracting and irritating (it sounds as if she has sleep apnea even while awake), but her phony dialogue is not improved at all by her guttersnipe boo-hooing, as Henry Higgins might call it. Contrived lines such as ""...you are the champion of my heart"" (pronounced by Ms. Zellweger as ""haht,"" in perhaps the most phony North Jersey accent ever committed to celluloid--she would have been much better off using her own, undoctored voice) are likely to induce cringing and perhaps even nausea, as Ms. Zellweger's purveying of them does not improve at all their overwrought schmaltz. Ms. Zellweger is simply abhorrent and is one of the film's very biggest drawbacks.<br/><br/>The quality of the film-making itself is top-notch, no corners cut, but even though the film is technically successful, dramatically it certainly is not. It simply has the look and feel of a 1950s formula studio picture, only sans the Dore Schary producer credit. Proceed with caution."

"KingMFreak","9","2","5","30 May 2005"," Not quite up to par with other films (mild spoilers possible)
","Boxing movies, it seems, are almost guaranteed to be great movies. We have Rocky, Raging Bull, and most recently Million Dollar Baby. I guess boxing is more interesting because it is more intense then, say, golf, or baseball. With boxing you can also provide well-developed characters and an emotional and touching plot. Clint Eastwood saw this and made the best boxing movie, Million Dollar Baby, which appeared out of nowhere in December and went on to triumph over The Aviator and prove that Oscar voters still sometimes get it right. <br/><br/>Cinderella Man is the true story of boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe), who was at the top of his prime in 1928, but slowly became weaker and finally was expelled from the boxing commission in 1933. He lives with his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and three kids in a rundown apartment. They can't pay the electrical bills, and Jim's broken hand keeps him from getting any shifts at the docks.<br/><br/>But he gets lucky when his manager, Joe (Paul Giamatti), signs him up at the last minute for a quick fight to lose to the second place heavy weight champion. What was intended to be Braddock's goodbye ends being his spectacular comeback. He takes out the champion and wins the $250 purse. Things escalate and soon he is fighting Max Baer (Craig Bierko) for one of his final fights.<br/><br/>The boxing movies mentioned in the first paragraph are all about boxing, yet the boxing isn't really featured that much. In Rocky, there are two fights total; Raging Bull has plenty in the beginning, but they disappear as the protagonist gets older; and Million Dollar Baby's last thirty minutes prove that it is something quite different. Yet Cinderella Man contains plenty of well-shot, intense fights. During the final fight, I observed many watchers sitting on the edge of their seats, involved in the intense fights.<br/><br/>Ron Howard makes good use of the flash bulbs used then. Whenever fists meet face, and flash bulb is used exactly on the impact, which is more effective than Neo and Agent Smith fighting in lightning. The angles change with every flash, and there are some interesting point of view shots. <br/><br/>The movie's biggest flaw is the failure to tell us why Jim is such a hero to the people. There is a scene where Mae goes to a church to pray for Jim, and finds it filled with other people also praying for Jim. Yet why these people think that he is their hero, their inspiration, is a story I would've liked to see. They could've added five more minutes of why everyone admired him (besides the obvious).<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is as good as ever, though there is nothing particularly special. He works well with Renee Zellweger as the struggling family trying to support their kids. Zellweger also executes her role with full control and doesn't overact, which she could've easily done. Giamatti's performance isn't up to par with Sideways, but he's still funny as the pudgy manager with smart comebacks.<br/><br/>It's not the best movie of the year, but it is an early contender for some Oscar nominations, most notably for Giamatti and Zellweger. The movie won't go so far as to win Best Picture, but it just might receive some nominations. My recommendations go to boxing fans and fans of any of the stars in the movie."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","5","2","6","10 September 2008"," Mediocre
","There are numerous problems with this film, starting with Ron Howard's being a mediocrity. His camera work, his lack of understanding of story structure, and the dearth of poetry from his films, make him a younger, balder Steven Spielberg, because only Howard rival's Spielberg's cast iron stomach for indulging sentimental drivel, and this film, like his other projects with potential (Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind), is totally castrated by Howard's inability to see life's variegations. The film that this most recalls are not fight films from that era, like Jimmy Cagney in City For Conquest nor Kirk Douglas in Champion, but Martin Scorsese's 1980 classic Raging Bull, about the life of ex-middleweight champion Jake La Motta. With one exception, where La Motta was undisciplined evil, Braddock (Russell Crowe) is shown as an All-American force for triumph over adversity. Yet, given that this tale is based in reality, the fact that it is rather unmoving, in comparison with Sylvester Stallone's 1976 film Rocky, says a lot of Howard's shortcomings as an artist, not the least of which are that the few fight scenes in the film are not nearly as good as those in the Scorsese film, although Howard does try to make the putative villain of the film, Heavyweight Champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko), look amazingly like Robert De Niro's La Motta.<br/><br/>Now, I am no stickler for historical accuracy when it comes to dramatizations, but there are limits that this film exceeds. The problem, though, seems to have been entirely with the creatively bankrupt trio of Crowe, Howard, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (who also butchered A Beautiful Mind), for in the DVD features, we get three commentary tracks, by Howard and Goldsman, which basically show how little Howard knows of narrative and how reliant he is on test screening audiences for what they like, rather than what is good (assuming he could even tell such), and how much he needs to schmooze his actors. The commentary by Goldsman shows how little of anything he has to say, but, the third track is from Cliff Hollingsworth, who knew many of the principals involved, as well the sport of boxing, and wrote the original treatment and screenplay of the film in 1995 then called The Cinderella Man, and he painstakingly details virtually every negative change the other three made to his script- not with bitterness, but the detachment of a man who's seen a living creation of his laying dead in a field. We find out that the scene of Baer finding out he was to fight Braddock was really in a restaurant, with a reporter, not in a hotel room where Baer was in a sexual threesome. What a bad man! We also find out that Braddock didn't return to his work as a stevedore the day after his first comeback fight. What a good man! I swear, that original film idea by Hollingsworth could have rivaled Raging Bull, because it seemed far more fact-based, realistic, and dramatic, with none of the tearjerker moments Howard swills in, such as the ridiculously mawkish sidestory of a fictional Braddock pal, Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine), who ends up crushed by the Depression. There is a pointless segment with Howard, and others involved in the film, sitting down to watch the last round of the Baer-Braddock fight with Norman Mailer, who pontificates and adds not a blessed thing of interest, save to stroke his ego. The other featurettes and trailers are standard issue, but I'd recommend the features just so you can hear Hollingsworth destroy the three people who destroyed his screenplay, although he does it so calmly and precisely that I doubt Howard nor the others listened to it. That Howard let the track be in the DVD has to be that he never listened to it, lest he would not have allowed Hollingsworth to detail his total lack of filmic comprehension.<br/><br/>Yet, the truth is that Cinderella Man is a mediocre film, with one dimensionalized caricatures all around, and is only saved from trash by good cinematography and the true and great aspects of a story that even a mawkmeister like Ron Howard couldn't destroy, such as wholly undermining the climactic final bout by breaking away to show a worried Mae wringing her hands and tear ducts. Let me think- what other great film scenarios could Howard ruin? How about Moby-Dick, where Ahab sees the whale is just an animal, and lets it roam the seas in peace? Or, maybe Howard could tackle War And Peace, but stick to just the Peace side? Oh, to be back with my dad, watching that sports trivia show, when the moment ruled, and the only thing after it all was memory, not regurgitated revisionism."
"rmax304823","4","2","6","24 June 2006"," And a left -- and a right!
","I don't think the theme goes farther back than Lysistrata, about 400 BC. Women object to men's afición for combat and try to stop it.<br/><br/>For forerunners of poor families drawn into boxing look for ""Body and Soul"" and ""Rocky"". Yet, as a feel-good movie, as most of Ron Howard's are, it works -- in the sense that you feel good at the end. Want to draw two lessons from it? Have a devoted wife (a great performance by Zellwiger) and every dumb Irishman should have a smart Jewish manager. So as not to burden the viewer with the necessity of thought, the script shows us characters that are exclusively one dimensional. Braddock's probity is never in doubt. And Max Baer is thoroughly evil, along the lines of Mr. T in ""Rocky III."" <br/><br/>No character ever changes or develops in any major way. What you see at first is what you get all the way through, although in those few scenes in which Crowe has to project some emotion, he delivers in the grand manner. The film even preaches that during the Great Depression, communism (or ""unionism"") was wrong-headed. Braddock's socially engaged working-class pal gets run over by a horse-drawn wagon in a Hooverville. Braddock, who refuses to fight anything that he can't see, like ""the economy,"" emerges victorious. That's the movie's political point of view, although the fact is, as every sensible person know, under capitalism man exploits man. Under communism it's just the opposite. <br/><br/>There are two good things about it. One is the fight scenes, that resemble paintings by Bellows. The choreography hasn't much new to offer but at least it doesn't repeat shots that have now become clichés. Little in the way of slow motion. On the other hand, Howard is so anxious for the viewer not to overlook even the most obvious points that when Braddock has one or two ribs cracked during a bout, the director actually shows us a brief X-ray of the ribs! <br/><br/>Does it resemble any previous sports movies? How could it not? Put ""The Rookie,"" ""Rocky"", and one or two others into a Waring blender and this is what you get. An entertaining, even gripping, thoroughly commercial fairy tale. Not that it's bad. It IS after all a feel-good movie. <br/><br/>And the scenes of economic desolation are convincing. When my grandmother died my grandfather, an immigrant, was saddled with three kids, the oldest about 12, while working 12 hours a day including Saturdays. He farmed them out and chipped in as well as he could, just as in this movie. Those who think of those days as a golden age, before taxes and such social programs as LIHEAP, ought to rethink things.<br/><br/>A second interesting point, though, is the stovepipe that sports provide into the wealthy class. It really worked for minorities. First Irish, then Italians and Jews, then blacks, then Latinos. Boxing, barbaric as it is, serves the same economic purpose as the military -- a way out of poverty."

Howard, as I have said before, just goes out of the way to manipulate an audience with stereo-typical ""ok now I am going to pull at your heartstrings"".

"HunterSVonnegut","Null","2","6","18 June 2005"," Hatchet Job
","I suppose when Hollywood tries to make an inspirational story about an underdog, it needs a villain too. Enter Max Baer. To suggest that he was proud of killing two men in the ring is both false and unfair. After Frankie Campbell's death from head injuries sustained in a fight with him, Baer was very upset, not proud. He was even (falsely) accused of manslaughter although the charges were later dropped. He donated subsequent purses to Campbell's family and put his children through college. Although somewhat of a clown in and out of the ring before this tragedy, some boxing historians suspect that Campbell's death also resulted in the death of Baer's ""killer instinct"" in the ring. If he really had tried to ""disconnect"" Braddock's brain, I don't think Opie Howard would have made a movie about The Cinderelle Man."

","Cinderella MAN<br/><br/>""When Americans were on their knees, he took their jobs to Canada.""<br/><br/>The highly publicized film ""Cinderella Man"" opens June 3. It is a classic American story in every way, with one exception: where it was made. It was filmed in Toronto instead of the United States, using labor heavily subsidized by the Canadian government. How ironic that this story of a man literally fighting to provide for his family at the height of the Depression should be filmed in a foreign country, costing America hundreds of middle-class jobs and contributing to the dangerous trade imbalance which now deeply concerns our economic experts.<br/><br/>James J. Braddock, the ""Cinderella Man,"" was born in New York City to Irish immigrant parents. His is a real-life ""Rocky"" story. He was a poor local boxer struggling to support his family when, fighting as a ten-to-one underdog, he defeated Max Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world in 1935. Seventy years later, the crowds cheering him on to victory in the film about his life are no longer Americans because the background artists portraying them are Canadians, as is the overwhelming majority of people employed in the making of this movie. Material that should be triumphantly American is counterfeit, a cheap and tawdry imitation of who we are.<br/><br/>In recent years millions of American jobs have been outsourced overseas to take advantage of lower labor rates. However, Canada and Australia, where ""Superman"" is now being filmed, are hardly third world nations. Unlike other industries, in the case of film and television production labor costs are made artificially lower in these and other countries by government subsidies which violate our trade agreements.<br/><br/>When 28 members of Congress sent a letter of protest over the choice to film James Braddock's story in Canada, the studios which produced ""Cinderella Man"" claimed they went to Toronto because it was the only place that had the right architecture. That's a lame excuse for a purely monetary decision. Plenty of cities in the United States still have buildings with the historically correct ""look"" for this picture. The studios went to Canada because one third of their labor costs were kicked back by the government, pure and simple.<br/><br/>The outsourcing of this and other productions in order to take advantage of illegal subsidies offered by foreign governments is more than just a moral and patriotic outrage. It doesn't only cost American jobs. It is also a very real threat to the economic stability of the United States. The filming of American movies and TV shows in foreign countries contributes to our ballooning trade deficit and the devaluation of our dollar against other currencies. As a result, outsourced production harms every single American citizen in a very real way.<br/><br/>Like the great champion James Braddock, you have the power to fight back. Send a message that the outsourcing of his story is not acceptable to Americans. DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO ""CINDERELLA MAN"" PROFITING LITERALLY AT YOUR EXPENSE BY BUYING A TICKET (or buying the DVD or renting the cassette when they become available.)"
"CubsandCulture","10","1","2","27 February 2019"," Strikingly traditionalist
","The overall structure of this film and the characterization of Braddock is straight forwardly traditionalist. Whether it is Braddock returning the relief money, or him trying to save a friend from his dangerous leftist ways the film strikes the notes of family, faith, and classic Americana. Likewise, the plotting of promise, fall, redemption and victory conform to what is expected of a sports drama in a pleasantly straightforward way. Of note, Baer is characterized as everything Braddock isn't-he's an arrogant playboy with a sadistic streak. It adds up to a comforting underdog story that is especially resonant during times of economic toughness. This film would have been a bigger hit if it was released a few years later.<br/><br/>The real strength of the film is Howard's direction. He pushes the visuals into noir-ish moody lighting and color scheme that fits the story rather well. The fights themselves are quite good; the editing flourishes of incorporating subjective POV, memory and (seeming) archival footage provide good uniqueness to them. The film's look does a great job of balance the hope and despair of the story and the depression.<br/><br/>Crowe is engaging here. Solid and sturdy he is daddylicious in the role. But the real standout is Giamatti as Joe. Funny and wise in the ways of the world he provides much needed acidic tenor to dull the sweet edges of the underdog story. I had forgotten just how violent Joe is. Giamatti has turned in better performances but this is a very good role for the character actor.<br/><br/>Good film. It is Seabiscuit if Seabiscuit was a boxer."

","Cinderella man is a dope asf movie. It has a nicely written script and i like how it shows the struggles of boxers from the great depression era. They where able to put tons of emotion into the movie even though it is a brutal boxing movie which gives the movie a nice balance. There is a good mix of personalities that are all strong and unique which makes every character liked and important in the script. This movie has a good way of showing the bond between a boxer and his coach. The main boxers coach was there to help him through all his fights and if he wasn't there i think that he would of lost most of his fights.I think they did that on purpose to give the movie a theme. They wanted to show how the little guy could rise up above everyone if he gave it his all. They pretty much used the hero's journey when they wrote the script but they made it work well. I think this is a great boxing movie that is timeless and just has something the other ones dont, Definitely a movie id keep in my personal collection."

In real life Baer was deeply remorseful about killing an opponent in the ring and supported the man's widow and children even putting the man's children through college. Thus Max Baer Jr,. was deeply upset with Ron Howard portraying his dad as a cold-hearted thug rather than the gentleman he was. Thus Jethro is not too happy with Opie."

With his boxing career basically over And Work hard to find Braddock held onto his pride and refused to go on government relief. There are others worse off he often said. By the end of 33 Braddock was broken to the point where he had no choice but to go on Government relief and Braddock swore to pay them back. Soon after Braddock was given a match a last minute replacement match against Corn Griffin a top ranked contender for the heavyweight Championship. Braddock surprised himself and everyone else by winning. This led to other fights which Braddock won. By then the people of America saw their struggle in Braddock and embraced him. Braddock became Their Champion. When Braddock finally got a shot at the Heavyweight Championship against Max Baer. The match was a clash of the titans. In one corner the everyman and in the other the Champion of the world the rich man's Champion. Baer was a killer in the ring and a Clown. but he was as serious a threat as a bullet from a gun. Braddock entered the underdog and no one gave him a chance. Then James J. Braddock made history by knocking out Max Baer for the Title. True to his vow Braddock paid back the relief money. And held on to the Championship for two years until he lost it to Joe Louis .<br/><br/>Ron Howard's Telling of the Braddock Legend is an excellent example of how to tell a story. First off Russell Crowe captures the shy nature of Braddock a honest man caught in try times that made good people Evil. that is driven home when you see the conditions in which they live . And when his oldest child steals to put food on the table and Braddock makes him return the meat. That is the finest scene in the movie. The acting is so pure and you are caught up in it . The Struggles they face and the bravery they had to have. The movie itself is a time machine that lets us peer into a window and see just how terrible the depression was and how it killed people in one way or the other. And how one man gave them hope and became their Champion."
"twimedina","8","1","2","19 November 2014"," The film was spectacular
","Cinderella man, the title has a typical romance movie ring to it, but it's not. Cinderella man (played by Russell Crowe) is a story about the real life boxer James Braddock, and how he made his way from living in the poor neighborhoods with his kids and wife Mae Braddock (Played by Rene Zellweger), to being a famous boxer who has become an inspiration all over the world. The movie has done an excellent job at portraying feelings and emotions. Director Ron Howard and screenwriters Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman did and excellent job at including important history, keeping the audience on their toes and craving more. They captured the human journey by artistically expressing failure and hope. This is not your usual romance/drama movie, it had a great deal of love in it in another way. In my opinion, it was beautifully expressed.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie is based on true events is not groundbreaking, but using real life events is a splendid way of having an interesting movie plot and making the film important. It's sublime. Cinderella man takes us through all of the journeys, it makes us feel the rush at the boxing matches, the unconditional love when Mae and James show each other deep love. It makes us cry with happiness whenever the children feel joy and it makes us laugh with the characters whenever jokes are being made. The actors did a great job at the accents which made it more real. As I have expressed, the movie is filled with joyous moments but I would have wanted the movie to give some of the other characters more personal background. It would have created more pity, if you will, among the audience with some of the characters. <br/><br/>James Braddock, the Cinderella man. He is a hero to his children and his wife. The film was spectacular and I strongly suggest that everyone takes their time to watch it. It is amazingly inspirational and the story is telling everyone that no matter where you come from, how old or rich you are, you can make great success in life. This is an exceptional drama/romance movie."

","Obviously, if you want to see a movie about actual boxing, this is not the one for you. The story is about a struggling boxer and the great depression; boxing itself is not the focal point. But it DOES have more ring scenes than ""Rocky""...<br/><br/>Movies like ""Cinderella Man"" tend to have one major issue: they often feel too ritzy, which renders them unconvincing. This was one of the few movies that managed to portray the period of the great depression very believably. The movie is quite atmospheric and has a genuine feel of despair to it.<br/><br/>The acting is impeccable. In the beginning, I was not sure about Renee Z.; they didn't seem to be a good match, but both actors are very good, so they pulled it off. The chemistry was probably fake, but it was present. The supporting actors, including the kids, were also very good.<br/><br/>The movie was not exactly suspenseful, but there were practically no cheesy moments and it wasn't predictable, which is something I greatly appreciate in a film. There was some humour, too. All in all, the movie feels realistic, the story is compelling, and the lead characters are likable and charismatic.<br/><br/>A heart-warming, inspirational movie. Definitely worth adding to your movie collection, even if you're not a huge fan of drama."

","Where to begin? As a huge boxing fan I know more about boxers than most boxing historians themselves. I had already read the book before watching the film and knew who James J Braddock was. Russell Crowe being my favorite actor, I knew this film was a must see. The first time I cried and even to this day the scenes, the music the whole way Russell Crowe makes me believe he is James J Braddock makes the hairs on my neck stand up. Paul Giamatti was so convincing and passionate in the film that he brought the trainer role to life as the best boxing trainer I've ever seen on film. Craig Bierko was an astonishing in how much his appearance, swagger and accent resembled the real max. The accents in the film were all generally very accurate of the 1930s New Jersey type. Renee Zellwegger was cracking as I felt the connection between the 2 was terrifyingly vivid. Overall a masterpiece of a film, brilliantly directed and great choice of cast."

","""In all the history of the boxing game you find no human interest story to compare with the life narrative of James J. Braddock"" is how the famed writer (and boxing fan) Damon Runyon described the Boxer he dubbed ""Cinderella Man"". Director Ron Howard uses the quote to open the film. So, you are guaranteed a heartwarming story of a man who overcomes abject poverty.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe (as Jim Braddock) begins as a moderately successful boxer, living with wife Renée Zellweger (as Mae) and their three young children. The Braddock family suffers through bad luck, cold New Jersey winters, and the Great Depression. If you've been cold and poor, you'll identify with warming socks in the stove and adding water to stretch a bottle of milk.<br/><br/>The film's, and the leading character's, high moral tone is set when Mr. Crowe, in an early scene, brings his son to the local butcher shop; there, the boy returns a piece of meat he stole to feed the hungry Braddock family. ""No matter what happens, we don't steal,"" Crowe explains. Ever. He also promises the children, ""We will never send you away,"" and sobs when poverty dictates otherwise. His dedication and commitment to his wife and children are the driving force in the life of the boxer. <br/><br/>Today, the boxing ring has been taken over, in popularity, by choreographed pretenders. But, once upon a time, you were to cause your opponent actual physical damage. Continuing to hit someone in the head until they fell, ""Knocked Out"", was the prime directive. During a fight, Crowe's manager Paul Giamatti (as Joe Gould) demands, ""Fill his face with blood!"" <br/><br/>Later, Crowe's Braddock is successful enough to face wicked champion Craig Bierko (as Max Baer), who is credited as having ""killed two men in the ring."" So, the fight is promoted as a chance to witness a potential murder. Boxing and morality make strange bedfellows. But, ""Cinderella Man"" is a pretty, predictable, and well-produced film.<br/><br/>****** Cinderella Man (2005) Ron Howard ~ Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger, Paul Giamatti"
"ClaytonDavis","9","1","2","22 October 2007"," A Cinderella Story without the Glass Shoes
","From acclaimed director Ron Howard comes the mesmerizing and tantalizing Cinderella Man starring Oscar winners Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. Crowe plays James J. Braddock, a boxer in the 1920s who lost nearly everything he had in the great stock market crash. After his finances diminish, the boxer hits a losing streak and when all hope is lost, a sudden surge of luck comes to the noble James.<br/><br/>When it comes to Crowe, he turns in one amazing performance after another. With previous nominated and awarded works in The Insider, Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind, Crowe still doesn't fail to impress the viewer. The vulnerability that Crowe lacks often in his tough guy roles is more evident than ever. It's his demeanor, dedication and well written character by Cliff Collingsworth and Akiva Goldsman that makes the film work so well.<br/><br/>Zellweger, who plays Mae Braddock, the supportive wife of James gives a quite dull and mediocre performance. Zellweger who has been a top talent for the past ten years is suffering from over-exposure and not being able to bring new things to her roles she chooses. Bridget Jones' Diary, Chicago, Cold Mountain, we've seen it all yet she still lands these well written roles which could be home run hit for many other talented actresses.<br/><br/>The entire cast of the film is quite superb; Craig Bierko as Max Baer, the reigning champion that Braddock must dare face. Bierko has a great screen presence that draws the viewer to him. A quality possessed by veteran actors Robert Duvall and Anthony Hopkins and newcomers Clive Owen and Ryan Gosling.<br/><br/>The revelation of the picture is from the Oscar snubbed actor for Sideways, Paul Giamatti. Playing Joe Gould, James' boxing trainer could be a very cliché role for any performer taking it yet Giamatti elevates the role and material. Joe's charisma, laughter and beautiful soul captures the audience first frame of his presence. Giamatti might be one of the finest actors underused in every way. We wait to see what his future could possibly hold.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard has a beautiful style of film-making but for some reason, he doesn't always seem to peak out of his films like Spielberg, Coppola, or Eastwood. Howard has a tough time with it and you seem to feel that it's the actors that do the grunt of the work. I'm not sure if that's a bunch of crap I'm talking but its just something I feel about Howard.<br/><br/>The cinematography and film editing are definitely that standout technical aspects of the film. Add that with Thomas Newman's score and you have a visually stunning piece of cinema. An enjoyable time of Crowe boxing around indeed.<br/><br/>Grade: ***½/****"

Perhaps it was based on my frame of mind while watching, but as a father of three, this was incredibly poignant.<br/><br/>How much do we go without today? How much could we if need be? This is not a boxing movie. It's a triumph of the human will epic. That is why it succeeds.<br/><br/>I was willing to overlook the Adam Carolla look-alike playing Baer.

The film was perfect, probably the best boxing movie ever made, beating out Rocky (which is hard to beat) and at least having a tie if not winning by a nose against Raging Bull (which is impossible to beat). The reasons why it is so great is as follows... 1. The fights are the best ever 2. It is a true story and an uplifting one 3. the performances are stellar (granted the performances in Raging Bull were the best in the business). 4. The manager was the best ever (Paul G.) and he really showed how the relationship between a manager and a boxer works. 5. This film meant a lot to me. I was going through some hard times and it gave me hope and inspiration. Any movies that can reach into a life and change it get's my vote. 6. It has a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>And so I give it a ten, and I hope that it has a more successful afterlife."

","Cinderella Man is the true story of James ""Jim"" Braddock. At the beginning of the movie Braddock is at the peak of his boxing career and on top of the world, until the Great Depression hits and he injures his hand and gives up his boxing career. Braddock is forced to find odd jobs to support his family until he steps back into the ring again to prove to himself that he's still got what it takes. The acting is great (Craig Bierko, normally a comedic actor, gives a surprisingly great performance as the antagonist Max Baer), but what I also loved was the boxing action in it and the intensity of it Ron Howard was able to put together. I hate to put in a cheesy boxing pun, but it was a real knockout! O.K. I'm done. Great movie 10/10"

","I have seen Cinderella Man numerous times since its release in 2005. Despite my repeated viewings it still has the ability to grab my attention and not let go. The acting is great and the cinematography is nearly flawless. However, my favorite part of the film is its plot. James is a man who has fallen on hard times as a result of the Great Depression. He was like most other people at the time, his life savings was tied up in investment. This sets up a great story of determination that has an effect on me that most other movies cannot achieve. I really enjoyed how it focused on the Depression and the terrible effect that it had on the general public of America. I have never rooted for a character as much as i did for Jimmy. The final fight, which pitted Jimmy against Max Baer, was one of the most gripping scenes I have ever witnessed in a movie. Even after so many viewings, every time I watch the last 20 minutes of Cinderella Man the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I would recommend this film to anyone with a pulse."
"arieliondotcom","9","1","2","25 June 2006"," Spoilers? A Sucker Punch to the Heart
","Okay, so you're probably thinking the same thing I did. Another boxing movie? We've seen Rocky done to death, and the Champ. What could Ronnie Howard have been thinking choosing this for a subject? No matter how he handled it it had to be bad. To tell the truth, I only watched it (on cable) because I was so bored. Coming so close to Howard losing his mind doing ""Da Vinci Crud"" and selling himself and his faithful audiences out by turning against Christ, I didn't have high hopes for this film. Especially during the first 1/3 of it when you get your face rubbed into the dirt of the Great Depression over and over. It comes to the brink of being laughable...what else are they going to do to these people to show how desperate they were? Have them start eating each other? But then you see the acting of Russell Crowe when he goes literally begging those who got rich off of him for $16 to keep his children with him and that's it. It's a sucker punch to the heart and you realize you really care about this character.<br/><br/>I'll admit not being the brightest bulb on the tree. It took me a while to realize that this was a true story. Do yourself a favor AFTER watching this movie and Google photos of the real Max Baer and James J. Braddock. Baer was a monster and Braddock looks scrawnier than Crowe. It will give you an extra level of appreciation for the film. I didn't know how the fights would go and highly recommend NOT looking it up until after the movie if you don't know. I actually found myself biting my hand (hey, it's an Italian thing) with excitement during the climactic fight.<br/><br/>Rocky, the Champ, yeah, you've seen it all before. But you owe it to yourself to see this for Crowe's acting performance and some great directing that gives you the feeling of what a monster Baer must have been to go against. You'll thank yourself...When you catch your breath."
"another-dreamer","7","1","2","13 April 2006"," The Violent Man Glorifed, and His Mistress Pleased
","""Cinderalla Man"" is a movie about gendered confrontation between the heroic archetype of man, and the circumstances which vitiate ALL of men's struggles against adversity, and despair.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition between ""cinderela"" and ""man"" provides us with an obvious, and most profound dichotomy between the spirit or male/female relationships. At once the man as dreamer, and the woman as hope/faith - the Saviour of our transgressions.<br/><br/>Are we not going tired of this relational nexus? Perhaps this is an academic question. We are bound to relate to the desperation of the impoverished soul. The Man, qua provider, is guilt ridden, and rendered useless. As ""men"", as dutiful, subservient providers, the boxer is most comfortable with violence, the dull blunt blow to his opponents skull. This violence is simple, learned, refined.<br/><br/>Men are at their finest when simplicity reigns, and the consequence of any action, any friction leads either to glory or shame. On this linear scale, men do not understand love without pride, victory without concomitant shame of the vanquished.<br/><br/>A woman may not experience shame as her hungry kids run wild, pleading necessity as bread becomes their only sustenance. But a man will lose that which makes the man, pride, protection, reliance.<br/><br/>This film reaffirms the gendered roles of Man and Woman. It does this in non-prejudicial fashion. Old-school feminists may cringe. But beauty is found in Man is Saviour, Jesus on the cross. Beauty in woman is grace, understanding, and deference to the man that acts out of instinct. The sharp blow - the temporary victory - and then he must return to face the sins of his progeny.<br/><br/>This film describes the male condition. The pride that accompanies glorious victory, and the decrepitude that invades his soul upon defeat.<br/><br/>The moral: man is moved and impoverished by love and desperation to avoid the stripping of his pride -- woman by pragmatics; woman by love, devotion.<br/><br/>These ideas are indeed dated, but a careful observer of the husband/wife dynamics as so explicitly expressed by ""Cinderalla Man"" may shed the modern, and peel back to the fundamental difference in gender. And the contribution each makes to join, to live, to experience the ecstasy of existence.<br/><br/>And happiness is lost in love, but found in the memories of the nostalgic. It was ""bad"" says our brains, but our heart - the biggest in boxing - relieves this naive premiss, and instructs on the give and take of love.<br/><br/>Perhaps among the best boxing films of the twentieth century. Man against Man. Man against himself. And beauty in the heart that destroyed the body but cries out admit simultaneous bliss/defeat tethered to the loose strings of the ring. Boxing makes every brave should eternal, and this heart, this peace rings like the bell of the final round. <br/><br/>Behing in the score card, bleeding, we are men that deserve the dulcimer forgiveness of Mary, of all women who spread their wisdom like fire. And place incest at the feet of our ruin.<br/><br/>We run from this burn, but this burn is our Saviour. Hot, lamentable - BUT WE EXIST, and tip the sounder to quit the death knell, and let us resume the only role we know. We relax. And pray that in our defense cowardice was prudence, and we live another day. To squeeze the love bliss from our intimate encounters. And finally save ourselves in the lost, careening sky that falters - for NO ONE is witness, save out pitiful selves."

","Fantastic boxing movie, the period feel is convincing and having read the autobiography of James Bradock by Michael DeLisa, the picture fulfills all expectations. Russell Crowe does a great job of portraying the down at heel boxer who wants to provide for his family but is rendered impotent by the recession and lack of work. Rene Zelweger provides a convincing and grounded portrayal of the pugilists wife with a sensitivity only dreamt of in the Rocky movie concept.<br/><br/>The best ring scene for me is during Bradocks second comeback bout when he takes a phenomenal punch from Art Lasky and looks doomed to fall. The camera hits slow motion with flashbacks of Bradock reeling whilst thinking about his wife and children. He then regains his composure and smiles bloodily at Lasky (who drops his gloves in amazement) before going on to dramatically win the bout. Wonderful heart searching stuff,even for none boxing fans.

"toby-mikelbank","9","1","2","16 March 2006"," another knockout for director ron howard
","I watched Cinderella Man recently and highly recommend it. The story revolves around depression-era boxer (J. Braddock) played by Russell Crowe. His wife is played by Renee Z. and Paul Giametti plays his manager. The story is basically about his fall from near glory and his amazing comeback. Now, we have seen this formula before, but there's several reasons that for this movie that doesn't really matter. First of all, this is a true story (or based on a true story of J. Braddock), although I was not familiar with the man when I saw this film. Secondly, the way this story is unfolded, you will be rooting for him and hanging off the edge of your seat whether you know how the story ends or not. The last 20 minutes are especially exciting and we all love movies that end well. Lastly, this film is also the story of the Great Depression, and let me tell you, the hopelessness of the people of that era is well conveyed. For me it really put into perspective just how much Americans before us have suffered, and how good we have it now. Better than any point in our history really. Russell C. becomes the humble soft-spoken Braddock, and his performance seemed flawless to me. I felt every line he spoke in the movie was appropriately delivered and felt real. I always look forward to seeing Paul Giamatti in a film, regardless of what film it is, and he sure doesn't disappoint here. His performance just in the corner of the boxing ring watching Braddock box is almost as intense as the fighting itself. Of course Rene Z. is perfect in her role as always, and never seems to have a trace of ""Hollywood"" in her, but instead all you'll see is a desperate depression era housewife. It seems that director Ron Howard is incapable of making a mediocre movie, almost as if he doesn't know how to fail. His track record, while not producing the huge talked about blockbusters like some directors, is really an amazing string of consistently great movies, and this one is even one of the better of his collection. Chalk this up as one of the best boxing movies made. Put it up there with Rocky (the first one), Raging Bull and Million Dollar Baby. If you don't have it yet, add it too your collection."

","Whenever I see a Russell Crowe movie, I expect it to be good. Same goes for movies directed by Ron Howard. I was not disappointed by Cinderella Man, which was far better than all the Rockys put together. Maybe it's because it was based on a true story. Maybe it's because the fight scenes seemed believable. If you look at film of the real Braddock-Baer fight, you know that the fighting in the movie was a little more lively and exaggerated. But it was still believable, unlike the footage from a typical Rocky movie. And what can I say about the performance by Paul Giamatti. Never heard of the guy before, but I want to see him in another movie to see if his great performance was due to a perfect role for him or because he's a great actor. No question about Crowe's acting ability. One recommendation I would have, even if you have great hearing, is to run the captioning when you watch the movie. There are lots of low points and instances, such as right before the start of the championship fight, where lots of people are talking at the same time.

Definitely one you will want in your collection.<br/><br/>I give it 9/10."

","I didn't think there could be better movie boxing action than in Raging Bull, but I should know by now to never say never. I was completely absorbed in this period piece from director Ron Howard, with Russel Crowe as protagonist Jim Braddock. Crowe is excellent as always - probably my favorite contemporary actor (despite his asinine off-screen antics). I recall when this movie was released that there was some controversy over the negative portrayal of heavyweight champion Max Baer (nicely portrayed by Craig Bierko). While there may be merit to the criticism, I choose to ignore the reality and remain fascinated by the story. 5 stars and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

","Still can't believe it lost to a movie about two faggot-cowboys.<br/><br/>Hollywood...it's going to be a very long time before you get any of my money at the box office again.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man was the best movie I've seen in years. Why was it not even nominated?<br/><br/>I have to write ten lines to comment, and I can't think of anything else to say. <br/><br/>I'm speechless at the results of this years' Academy Awards...the Academy must ALL be a bunch of flaming-faggots who have to validate their peculiar existence with a fake gold statue.<br/><br/>Someone tell me...what's their beef with Russel Crowe?"

","In 1928, James. J. Braddock was a champion light-heavyweight prizefighter. By 1933, though, he'd hit some pretty hard times, along with most of the rest of America. With a broken right hand and a doused spirit, Braddock was so pathetic in the ring that his license to fight was revoked. Unable to pay the bills, Braddock's family has to sell off nearly everything it owns to survive. Braddock can't even get steady work at the docks, as there are precious few jobs each day. In celebration of the indomitable American spirit, Braddock rises from his squalor ashes to challenge the legendary - and murderous - Max Baer for the heavyweight championship at Madison Square Garden.<br/><br/>Braddock (Russell Crowe) isn't fighting for himself; he's fighting for his wife Mae (Rene Zellweger) and their three kids and the entirety of the impoverished populace of America, people utterly destroyed and broken by the Great Depression. Crowe's Braddock is resilient and courageous, undergoing tremendous suffering to keep his family honorably fed. Crowe himself is amazing, grim-faced, intrepid, humble, and noble. He doesn't see boxing as his right, but as a distinct privilege. Crowe's performance is gutsy, physically demanding, and so evocative that the viewer can feel the punches he's taking - and dishing out.<br/><br/>Standing behind Braddock and his career choice is his long-suffering wife Mae, although it takes her some time to fully comprehend what Braddock's struggles really mean. Zellweger portrays Mae as no wilting flower, able to love her husband for his boxing and in spite of it. Braddock's other main source of inspiration comes in the person of his trainer/manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti, who was nominated for an Oscar - finally). Gould cares very deeply about the welfare of his fighter, almost to the exclusion of everything else. He proves himself to be a true friend to Braddock, remaining with him through even the toughest times. Giamatti delivers a powerhouse performance as the cagey ringhand; it's hard to imagine a runty looking guy like Giamatti could play such a tough-as-nails character, but he pulls it off, seemingly effortlessly.<br/><br/>Although this is a sports biopic, the movie never veers to the maudlin, never choosing melodrama over sincerity. Moving, compassionate, and beautiful, Cinderella Man is the kind of movie that makes even the manliest men weep openly and certainly leaves an indelible mark on your heart. The violence is brutal - particularly the final fight against Baer - but never gratuitously so, showing that the steady hand of director Ron Howard once again has produced a honest winner. The entire cast is magnificent (and look for Howard's brother Clint in a small role)."
"teh_mode","7","1","2","30 January 2006"," Solid biopic with great performances
","The fact that this film is based on real-life events makes it all the more astonishing. I would still advise all people wanting to see this to know as little as possible about the back story as possible. I really didn't know how this one was going to pan out. And when it finished, it made it all the more invigorating.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe plays James Braddock, a depression era boxer who loses everything after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After landing a temporary position as a dock yard worker, Braddock finds himself with little means to support his family. His old time manager - played wonderfully by Paul Giamatti - decides to get him in the ring for one last showdown, as the scheduled contender had to withdraw. Seeing this as a way of making a potentially life saving $250, Braddock accepts the challenge - much to the worry of his wife (Renee Zellwenger). The film then chronicles his subsequent re-rise through the boxing ranks, as he defies all the odds and becomes labelled ""The Cinderella Man"".<br/><br/>As a spectacle, the film is wonderful. The boxing scenes are in my opinion the best filmed since Raging Bull - and I do not say that lightly. You really do feel like ribs are being crushed and craniums cracked. You will be gripping the edge of your seat. On an emotional level the film borderlines between warm sentiment and mawkish schmaltz, although it definitely evoked far more heartfelt smiles then it did rolled eyes.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe is on top form. His best performance is still Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider (1999), but this one is definitely up there along with Gladiator (2000). Equally effective is Paul Giamatti, and I think both men deserve Oscar recognition, especially after Giamatti was completely overlooked for his wonderful turn in Sideways (2004).<br/><br/>A really good, really exciting, heartfelt piece of work."

","Boxing is not my favourite sport. In fact, it is not even a sport. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying this movie. I got it as a Christmas pressie and had never heard of it. When I discovered it was a Ron Howard film that peaked my interest. Having watched it, I found it compelling and almost as good as Howard's Appollo 13. For anyone who enjoyed that movie they should watch this one. For anyone who likes Boxing it is as riviting as Raging Bull. Like the Scorcese film, it has a fine cast but lacks something which I cannot figure out. I really enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed movies about Boxing, the Depression, and about the struggles of a family.

","Cinderella Man is the story of an underdog boxer during the depression who's motivation and love for his family bring him great lengths. This movie has something for everyone. It's not a 'feel good' movie, but it will leave you feeling good. It is not a tear jerker, but at some points you could cry in happiness. It's not a romance, but it is very sweet. It's not an action movie, but it will have you at the edge of your seat cheering for the hero. It will give your feelings a ride, but without being cheesy. If you're feeling something, it's because the plot and acting hit you straight on, not because the situation you're viewing was constructed to make you feel. There is enough depth to the story and enough going on to keep your interested until the end, and it still manages not to include any useless characters or subplots. Your mind and your heart will both be entertained.<br/><br/>The plot is not a mystery. There is nothing to figure out, no double crossing characters. Cinderella Man does not rely on twists and turns to keep the audience entertained. It managed to subtly draw extreme feelings and excitement with a combination of amazing acting, directing, and plot that will leave you much more satisfied than the common twist that many movies these days feel the need to have. To make sure nobody reading this gets the wrong idea, by no twist I am not saying that the movie is simple or 'airhead.' It has a plot that you can call a plot with a straight face.<br/><br/>This movie had a few noticeable peaks. It includes one of those off your seat moments when you're giving your buddies hi-fives and saying 'hell yea!'.. you know, one of those times when you are so completely involved with the movie that you forget you're watching one. My heart was beating and blood pumping. My friend and I both had a huge smile our faces. It was truly a defining moment in the movie all while being symbolic and fast paced. I can't remember the last time I've watched a movie with such an incredibly crafted peak. The best part about the peak was it was not even the ending! Camera work was great. Lighting is not too dark and not all bright. As I mentioned the actors are all superb. Russel Crowe was amazing, as usual.<br/><br/>I love a good movie that I can get lost in, and this is one the few that has left me sitting with no complaints. This is a real quality movie, a real gem."

But when the depression strikes hardest, James' career goes down the drain. Left struggling for low paying jobs, James's family becomes in danger of falling apart. From there children freezing in their own home to barely being able to pay the electric bill, life is a living hell. But when his old agent comes back with a match things start to change.

"esurfergrl","10","1","2","29 December 2005"," Sensational Film on Every Level
","Cinderella Man was certainly the best film I saw last year, and will rank among the best films I have ever seen. Ron Howard continues to excel as a brilliantly gifted, responsible, director-producer of films that do not conform to the pressures of commercial popularity. I know that my time watching any one of his movies is time well spent. Any cinema award organization that misses this one should be terminally embarrassed. It deserves a place among the greatest films of all time. So deserving a film, that even with some violence, it earned a PG13 rating! <br/><br/>We seldom see such a skillfully honest, beautifully crafted, occasionally shocking, entertaining, and fascinating portrayal of our nation's recent history that has shaped our present. Cinderella Man has a lot to offer from the realistic settings, to the incredible performances, and well written story line, which both moves and inspires the viewer. <br/><br/>Renee Zellweiger was fabulous as the female lead to Crowe's equally brilliant portrayal of the male lead, and there is hardly a word spoken of her excellent work in any review I have seen. I refuse to believe that it is because she does not play on surface glamor and sexuality to craft her role, popular commercially, but believe that accolades for her deep performance will emerge as more people see the film, now that it has been released on DVD. Esconsed within the story is a tender romance. Crowe continues to amaze with his ability to become another man, and engage us with his character, and the actors in supporting roles were equally excellent and deserving. Paul Giamatti as the agent was compelling, and the bad guys were great also.<br/><br/>Somewhere I saw a review that said that this is film-making the way it once was, and should be, and that is the truth. It deserves top honors for all categories."

Both of us having kids just sat and felt the pain of these parents trying to raise their children during the great depression era. I have to say it made me truly feel blessed to not have to go thru the trials that they faced back then. The movie was a great in the way that they showed the whole town rallying for him. The concern that his loved ones had for him and the last match on the edge of your seat whether or not he wins or loses. It was an inspiring story and I would recommend it to anyone, boxing fan or not."
"soldaten116","9","1","2","19 December 2005"," Superb movie, even if a bit flawed
","Let me start by saying: This was a good movie - A very good movie. I will put it on my Christmas/Birthday wish list. I haven't really seen a lot of Depression era movies so I don't have a lot of experience in that area to judge. Ron Howard does an excellent job of bringing what I would assume it to be, back to life. I never empathized or sympathize with the men and women from that time as much as I do now. You get a good sense of how desperate times were and how good, hard working and decent people tried to survive it. It was a very powerful representation of life back then and very moving.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, this is a boxing movie. So a once great boxer hits the bricks and is given a second chance. He runs with it and succeeds beyond anyone's imagination. There's the uber-villain Champ boxer who plays dirty and the self centered, cold and cruel promoter of the fight too. All of the elements are here for a solid boxing movie that you've seen before. Only you haven't. Not like this. I won't go into how and spoil it for you it's that this boxing drama is not a copy cat of it's predecessors. It was similar in format but not the same.<br/><br/>I reserve my biggest criticism for Ron Howard's portrayal of Max Baer. I thought it was unnecessarily harsh and didn't need to be presented like that. Max actually only killed one man in the ring. Doctors only attributed the other in theory to him. The death at his hands of one opponent was a heavy burden for Max and he regularly gave his winning purses to the family of the man he killed. He suffered emotionally for it the rest of his life according to friends and family. He was considered a professional and a gentleman. He was an imposing figure and his reputation for strong boxing should have been enough of an obstacle. Villain-oozing him with the death threats and trash talking was not true to his character. I know it makes for better movie suspense but to me it tainted the last fight and I had to keep telling myself to relax, they had to sell movie tickets too.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Go see this movie but do not do any research on Braddock or anyone of his opponents. It is entertainment, not a documentary. As entertainment it is spectacular. History and boxing buffs may gruff at the interpretation. They were right on the mark when they said, ""Based on a true story."""
"tlc75372","10","1","2","12 December 2005"," Crowe and Howard Triumph Again
","Russell Crowe again demonstrates his total command of the acting profession. He no longer acts, he becomes the character. He is one one of the great film stars of all time, warts and all.<br/><br/>Many will consider this a minor movie, perhaps it is out of step with the digital youth market but don't compare this movie with the scifi, horror, comic book garbage that dominates the industry, or the the entertaining but kiddie Harry Potti stuff. Ron Howard, a great cast and a really great true story all combine to do the impossible, create a wonderful, enjoyable, memorable movie about people. It's not make believe, it's real.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe and Ron Howard link us with the great movies of the past. They didn't do any better back in Hollywood's heyday.

Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger are convincing actors as they portray a couple living through the Great Depression, struggling to feed their three children. Russell Crowe, as Jimmy Braddock (Cinderella Man), beats all odds, including a broken wrist and broken a ribs and losing his boxing license, to make a phenomenal comeback, winning the title. Jimmy's integrity remains intact after he wins the title, as at the end of the movie viewers are informed that he served faithfully in the war, bought a home for his family in NJ, and then owned and operated machines where he used to work the few shifts he could get during the oppression."

","WOW!<br/><br/>Just let me say right off - I'm a huge Boxing fan and something of an amateur 'boxing historian' so I want to state that Bias up front. Having said that - It gave me all the more reason to pay attention to this film and honestly I went in with some doubt about the Critical Acclaim that has been touting this film as if it were a masterpiece or some sort of secret weapon to sweep the Oscars. THE CRITICS WERE RIGHT THIS TIME and Cinderella Man is The Real Deal! <br/><br/>Everything is right with this movie, starting off with one of the most inspiring, moving stories in American History - about a man who was everything right and good about the USA once!<br/><br/>I promise you do not need to be a Boxing Fan to love this movie - but if you are you will be astonished at how fantastic those aspects are. You can barely believe the attention to the times of the sport, from the equipment to the arenas to the fighters styles to the fighters physiques even. I swear that WAS Max Baer or Primo Carnera in there!!<br/><br/>Everything is right from the sets, the historical instances, the cars, the visual image and look of the film. Its just wonderful in its visual appeal, the depression dull while the wealthy areas are so elegant and rich to look at. The Acting is AMAZING and there is not a bad performance .. heck, performances which are not even meant to be 'performances' are amazing from Max Baer to The NBC Announcer to the Braddock children , not to mention Crowe and Zellwiger! Everyone delivers MORE than you would even ask for! Giamatti is now forever impressed on me as THE new cinema caricature of Coach (Angelo Dundee thank you!)<br/><br/>Well sorry if I'm ranting and raving folks but I'm not even going to bother with detailed analysis or go through the plot line which many already know as its historical. Instead Let me just say that if you are like me, you have been a little disappointed with a string of recent films being touted as 'incredible' or 'masterpieces' and then finding out that while 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Mystic River' were good and all.. they were not exactly in the realm of 'Truly Great Films'. Get ready for a treat because Cinderella Man IS a contender for a spot among the truly great films ever made!<br/><br/>Amazing shots in this movie too (look for fantastic techniques where Braddock views footage and how its done.. awesome!) Fantastic choice to focus the action in words over the radio.. at some points you are not even watching the fight but listening to it just as people did on Radios back then.. and you experience it like they did and what a great job on that! You will find yourself laughing out loud in this movie - believe it or not it has sincerely comedic moments too. You can catch yourself wanting to cry (warning: Women AND Men both at risk) and I caught myself literally cheering out loud at the screen!<br/><br/>Everything is right about this incredible Ron Howard film and I sincerely hope everyone takes a break from the 'Fantastic Four' and 'Goofball Comedies' for just one evening to sit down to a truly magnificent and destined to be classic film called Cinderella Man.<br/><br/>If you see this movie for no other reason than to visit the Great Depression and learn about a truly fantastic hero in more ways than his career - Its worth it all! Finally a Movie with Skill, Heart and Soul!<br/><br/>*Just shy of a Perfect Ten for relatively nitpicky reasons of a 'best friend' character that doesn't seem to really fit in the movie right and with the bar this high I would have maybe liked to see something new with the 'fighters point of view' shots, even as great as the scenes were. 9.4 if I could heh.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man is the Real Deal!"

He directed Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind; and here he directs Russell Crowe in The Cinderella Man. But, this beautiful mind is not filled with math equations, but instead a mind consumed with doing the right thing no matter how difficult life turns out to be, and believe me it was a difficult life. He is as perfect or beautiful a human being as anyone can get. He is a good husband, father, and friend no matter what was thrown at him. If we could all wake up the next morning and say, ""I want to be like Jim Braddock"" this would be a better world. I am a little older than most and I still want to grow up to be like Jim Braddock.<br/><br/>If it weren't for people like Ron Howard and producers who take the risks of presenting stories like this we would have no clue, and they must be thanked time and time again.<br/><br/>Yes, I have heard about Max Baer (former Heavyweight champion of the world), but I had never heard the name Jim Braddock when anyone talked about the fight game. What a story! <br/><br/>The supporting cast was nothing short of perfect or beautiful too. Renee Zellweger, as Braddock's wife, lost that facial grimace that seemed to tell the world, ""I just ate a lemon."" I almost didn't recognize her and she is truly beautiful and one of our best actresses. Paul Giamatti lost that Richard Shiff (Toby, on the West Wing TV show) look and delivery (see Sideways) and was outstanding as Braddock's manager and trainer. Everyone was great. Can't say enough about the cast.<br/><br/>I think all the performances were truly great, however, if anyone is talking Oscar, I would have to say the story and the direction overpowered everything. What a story! And, we are just learning about this now? <br/><br/>Oh, yes there was some boxing in here too. Okay, a lot of boxing. The fight scenes were very good, but it's Braddock's story that is the most compelling. Actually, it is Braddock who is the most compelling.<br/><br/>I think it's safe to say that Damon Runyon in one of his columns called Jim Braddock The Cinderella Man.

"cariart","10","1","2","10 December 2005"," Crowe Superb in Extraordinary Film Bio...
","""Cinderella Man"", Ron Howard's heart-felt film biography of boxing legend James J. Braddock, never received the recognition it deserved when first released, due, in large part, to Russell Crowe's bad press following a telephone-throwing incident. Overzealous critics tended to lump the incident and film together, and despite Crowe's public apology, many moviegoers skipped it. Now that the film is available on DVD, it's time to acknowledge the film for what it always HAS been; director Howard and star Crowe's FINEST film, together! <br/><br/>Braddock's story is so amazing and inspirational, that it is astonishing that it's taken nearly sixty years to tell it. Sylvester Stallone 'borrowed' from it, extensively, in creating ""Rocky"", and in viewing the film, the parallels between fact and fiction are obvious; Braddock had been an 'up and comer' in the twenties, but broken bones and ill-advised matches had cost him a championship. Then the Depression struck, Braddock was wiped out, financially, and he struggled to support his wife and family through the most harrowing period in American history. Considered 'washed up' and too old for a comeback, all the boxer had going for him was his wife's love, his manager's faith, and his personal integrity, which refused to allow him to give up. Slowly he climbed back up the ranks of younger contenders, earning the adoration of a country trying to rebuild their own lives, as well, until, finally, he had his championship match, against ruthless 'killing machine' Max Baer. Their match would become the stuff of legends! <br/><br/>To director Howard's credit, he never 'over-sentimentalizes' the story, or tries to turn it into a soft-focus 'fairy tale'. His vision of the Depression is the most accurate and heartbreaking since the documentaries of the '30s, and will come as a revelation to those whose only knowledge of the period is a paragraph in a history book. Jim Braddock is not a 'Superman', but a hard-working, decent man with no higher vision than to provide his family a better life, and as magnificently portrayed by Crowe, he embodies qualities of honesty and dignity that many of us dream of, but seldom achieve. In any other year, he'd be a shoo-in for an Oscar for his performance, it's that good! <br/><br/>Matching Crowe's portrayal are Renée Zellweger, as his loyal wife, Mae, who perfectly channels a '30s 'style', as well as a gutsiness that is timeless, and the wonderful Paul Giamatti, as manager Joe Gould, who would sell everything he owned, rather than see Braddock give up. Giamatti, a veteran character actor who finally saw his 'breakthrough' in last year's ""Sideways"", should finally get his long-deserved Oscar, for this role.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" is a film that will continue to be cherished long after the filmmakers are gone, a tale rooted in an earlier era, but still timeless.<br/><br/>Movies just don't get better than this!"

","Apparently,after ""A beautiful mind"", another extra ordinary movie is bade by Ron Howard - Cinderella Man. The same production group, the same director, the same leading actor, and the same producer. This great and moving movie basically tells the same boxing movie - just like other boxing movie - put a person into the difficulty and then he eventually gains back what he deserves. However, this touching movie is different, in addition to the realistic boxing sequence, the setting can bring audiences back to the 30's. Russell Crowe once again plays an excellent job in this movie. At first, I assumed that ""Cinderella Man"" will be another ""A Beautiful Mind"", however, I was wrong after seeing this movie. This time, the director Ron Howard tries to tell a touching story in a normal and slight way. He did not put too much things into this film, but this common story makes people feel more. Anyway, go see this movie - another beautiful movie."

This was a real story with real characters. Not the card board cut outs that we're used to that Hollywood dishes out. This was truly an inspiring story that will reach the heart of any person who watches it. It touches the heart with the superb performances of Russell Crowe, Renee Zelweger & Paul Giamatti (who I think will win the Oscar this time. I thought he was robbed of it last year.)The story of Jimmy Braddock should serve as an example to all of us as a testament to perseverance against adversity and a triumph of the human spirit.

I have been an avid movie buff for many years and like many think that todays Hollywood creations are soulless by the numbers money makers, but this film has restored my faith in studio films.

","wow! I feel SO good after seeing this film. I didn't watch it by choice and was expecting sentimental dribble after reading several newspaper reviews. Well, reluctance gave way to pure admiration for Jimmy Braddock, his wife as well as Russel Crowe. I found myself restraining myself from yelling out ""Come on Jimmy!"" as his first comeback win was in action. The fighting scenes are fantastic- the lightbulb effect having a great dramatic effect. This story is an inspirational tale, in line with movies like Seabiscuit but in my opinion, better. <br/><br/>I'm still on a good mood high after seeing Cinderella Man. Some editorial work could have been improved perhaps. e.g. cutting away from the fights into an attentive bar seemed somewhat awkward and disjointed. However, this is just picking for the sake of being picky. I don't like violence, but boxing is different right?! (wink wink nudge nudge).

He gave a great performance in Sideways but after this performance it would be a crime if he was not welcomed warmly into the world of Stardom. In the movie world there is a lot of good talent out there, Russell Crow. Now I'm not a big Crow fan but he has talent, but every now and again we catch a glimpse of a star, Paul Giamatti is such a person. Russell Crow gave a good performance as Bradock, Zelwegger was totally awful, Paddy Constantine was his usual great self, almost as great a performance here as he gave in In America.

","I've never seen a movie about a boxer that is so humanist in its approach, it almost made me cry. Ron Howard might be panned for making a melodrama out of Braddocks life, but isn't life a continuing melodrama itself? I love Russel Crowe for his sincerity in breathing life to Braddock's character and Renee Zelwegger, as is usual, proves that her talent is not limited to playing Bridget Jones. This is an Oscar-worthy film, and if Crowe and Zelwegger don't earn nominations, I'd be disappointed. Howard's direction is quite focused. From the beginning to the end, we are hooked on Braddock's struggles to keep his family together despite money problems. Howard has struck the right chord in making the audience understand and appreciate Braddock's near forgotten life. And Crowe for making Braddock alive again, even for just a little more two hours. This is the best boxing movie since Martin Scorcese's Raging Bull."

Cinematography was very good for the fight scenes but i particularly liked the character build up for all the main casts; i found the manager's role played by Paul Giamatti, who was superb in sideways just a year ago, character build up was very progressive. He shed his ol pinot noir self to a very dedicated manager, not in it for the money only, but a lot more than that, kinda non don king type. Well, the film sheds new light on the fight industry during the 1929 depression and Jim Braddock proves to all that there's some light left at the end of the tunnel for all of us...if we believed in them<br/><br/>i'm a sucker for true stories and Cinderella man scores a perfect 10<br/><br/>go watch it if it's the last show you'll watch this year, brilliant stuff, kudos to all who made it possible!"

","An excellent film about the great depression fighter Jim Braddock who started as a poor has been prizefighter because of a broken right arm, and does everything he can for his family, driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. And he kept winning and inspired many people who are suffering under the great depression, because even though he is old and a bit of a has been, he never gave up, and he revived the American Spirit of 'never giving up' to them(which is why he is called the Cinderlla Man). Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring. But I think Max Baer portrayed as that was a little too much, but ya gotta love Craig Bierko's performance. Ron Howard did quite a good job at this, but too bad it didn't sell too well at the box office, this is great stuff here, too bad all the attention went to other overrated blockbusters such as 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'Bewitched'.

The chemistry between the two completely justifying the strong trustful bond Jim shared with his wife. Paul Giamatti as his indefatigable manager simply rocks. His sharp tongue & self-sacrifice in following his instincts & thus managing one of the greatest comebacks of all times is one of the high-points of the movie. The scene in which Mrs. Jim goes to this guy's house, knocking the door hard, hurling invectives at him only to find a single table with a couple of chairs in the house is simply terrific.

I go to the movies to escape, to learn something, and to be enriched. This film accomplished all that, and so much more. I was so grateful my two sons, ages 14 and 16 went with us. Going to the movies with your parents is so ""uncool"" at those ages, but as we shared our popcorn and the root beer we knew we couldn't really afford, we learned so much about the reality of The Depression, the bond of family, the importance of integrity, and the lessons we have always taught our children about what is right and wrong, and why. Our daughter, Rachel Youngberg, knew from a very early age that her calling in life was to become an actor, and we fought her tooth and nail, knowing how corrupt and evil people can become here in Hollywood. After seeing this film, I came away proud of her decision to stay and fight to make great films like Cinderella Man. I finally see what she has been trying to tell me for the past 15 years--how film can lift the human spirit, teach others, and be a light to this war-torn world. Ron Howard proved it can be done, and I hope the next time he needs a convincing cast for a creative film, he'll give my daughter a chance to audition for him. You've come a long way, ""Opie"", and when I see that Best Director Oscar in your hand, I will cry, but I will also pump the air with my fist, jubilate, and scream, ""Yes!""

"naberry44","8","1","2","20 July 2005"," Crowe and Howard are a winning combination
","Ron Howard and Russell Crowe have something going on. As Kauffman and Hart were to the screwball comedy, as Rogers and Hammerstein were to the Broadway musical, and as Burns and Allen were to banter comedy, Howard and Crowe should go down in entertainment history as the team that perfected the biographical movie. As an encore to their amazing collaboration in ""A Beautiful Mind"" the actor/director team has created a brooding, harrowing, and soulful journey through a slice of the life of boxer Jimmy Braddock, an unlikely heavyweight champ of the depression wracked 1930's. Given the success of ""Cinderella Man"" it seems apparent that this is a franchise in the making. The movie itself is simple. It follows a relatively short time in the life of boxer Braddock and his family and does not rely on an entire lifetime to make its point. No study of childhood psychological baggage here. It is very simply the gritty nature of Braddock's quest, the interplay between him, his wife, his kids and his always supportive manager, and the oppression of the era that are the recipe that makes this move a compelling work. <br/><br/>Set during a period in our history where the real consequences of the Great Depression are oftentimes either ignored or caricaturized, Howard pulls no punches in depicting the inhumanity of that slice of our history. Using an almost sepiaesque tone to the color, an era of gloom and doom is aptly created, throwing the viewer into a realistic reality of calamity. We are even taken on a not so pretty tour of ""Hoover Ville"" in 1930's Central Park that cannot help but move even the most stalwart of movie goers. Effectively using this as his backdrop, Howard paces the film so that the last hour is literally breathtaking as we follow Braddock through his final trek toward and into the title fight. The fight scenes themselves are remarkable in their ability to get the audience involved in each. Even with full knowledge of the outcome, Braddock's journey is exciting and suspenseful. This is great film-making. <br/><br/>Crowe is quite simply a great actor. His chameleon like ability to ""become"" is a joy to experience. Together with his character we feel his frustration, his angst, and almost overwhelmingly, his pain, both physically and emotionally. When he has to ask for public assistance and is forced to ""beg"" from boxing fat cats so as not to break a promise to his little boy that he would never send him away to live in their desperate times, it is almost excruciating to watch. We feel what he feels, we know what he knows, and we hurt like he hurts. This is great acting.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great also. Rene' Zellweger is understated as ever in her long suffering support of the title character. She has the ability to pull us equally into the story and creates a great role out of a weakly written part. She is truly the great woman behind this man. Equally effective in his role is Paul Giamatti as Braddock's manger. He is always there for Braddock. He seems almost like a guardian angel in his ""never say die"" demeanor, and his quest to continue Braddock's career. When he tells Braddock that they are revoking his license, we feel all the pain associated with having to break bad news to those we care about. His exuberance during the final fight is contagious. Craig Bierko as killer fighter Max Baer and Paddy Considine as Braddock's friend on the docks also turn in excellent performances.<br/><br/>As Howard continues to prove himself a truly great director, Crowe continues to pad his resume' with meaty and heartfelt performances in the vein of the best movie actors like Brando, Bogart, and Stewart. Mr. Crowe's ability to re-create himself in the context of every character he tackles puts him in a very small class with a very high caliber of movie actor. Howard just might be the consummate ""actor's"" director. His ability to glean stellar performances out of every actor in his movies from the smallest walk across to his biggest stars is nothing short of phenomenal, and certainly no fluke. Over and over again, Howard has proved himself. ""Cinderella Man"" will take it's place on his already prestigious resume' as one of his best, and hopefully this will not be the last we see of these two working together."
"noralee","8","1","2","27 June 2005"," A Heart and Head Pounding Cheer for the Good Guy
","""Cinderella Man"" is a shameless, old-fashioned sentimental bio-pic. And it works. <br/><br/>As one character says ""It ain't about pugilism."" But director Ron Howard pounds away at our emotions as much as Russell Crowe pounds his boxing opponents in the ring. Howard doesn't just push every emotional button in telling the amazing story of Jim Braddock, he milks every incident in what is just in its basic outline anyway a heart tugging story of the fall and rise of a decent dad battling the Great Depression. And, through frequent tears, it works. <br/><br/>Despite serious flaws, it works because of the central acting and the period recreation. <br/><br/>Once again Crowe completely transforms himself for a role, not only unsurprisingly physically for the boxing rounds, as he spends a good part of the movie in nothing but trunks, and with a hard-scrabbled Joisey accent, but as a devoted, romantic family man. Crowe certainly sets a new standard of portraying masculinity on the screen as equally about being a devoted and responsible husband and father even while engaging in the most physical of occupations. The closest we've seen him reveal the other side was briefly in ""The Insider,"" but we've never seen him play such an unassuming good guy, such that scenes when Braddock has to put aside his masculine pride to provide for his family are staggeringly moving. His frequent gentle giant interaction with the wonderfully natural young children, in particular, are almost too sweetly touching. <br/><br/>He is so captivating that you can see most of the actors in one-on-one with him rise to his level. Paul Giamatti as his manager matches him in duets as they ping pong concentration and humor. <br/><br/>Renée Zellweger with a wandering Jersey accent, though, doesn't have much to do in her passive loyal wife scenes with him and is actually stronger when she gets to flex some separate personality or where briefly there's some flare of conflict with her husband. Crowe's intensity envelops both of them, as we see her melt more beautifully here than we've seen her on film in years. <br/><br/>Surrounding Crowe like a Daumier tableau are marvelous character actors whose faces seem to be out of the gritty boxing game classic ""Body and Soul.""<br/><br/>It is like two films. One is a sweet Father Courage tale bathed in beautifully golden brown chiaroscuro by cinematographer Salvatore Totino that makes you feel you are looking at tinted photographs from the 1930's, complimented by marvelous costumes from individuals to the crowd scenes. But then he equally puts us directly in the ring, as brutally as he captured football in ""Any Given Sunday"" and you do feel every punch, such that you involuntarily grunt out loud. Helped by the masterful editing by Howard's usual partners Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill you also get inside Braddock's state of mind in each fight, a sympathetic technique I don't recall from other boxing films, including ""Raging Bull."" Giamatti's chattering, in combination with the ring side announcers, explains the basics of the sweet science to seamlessly help you see the strategy with each competitor so they are not just repetitive slug fests but are each exciting matches. <br/><br/>But what probably leads people to be able to criticize the Max Baer portrayal as unidimensionally villainous, which I don't think it is, is that so much of the period context is missing in the film or selectively stuck in, particularly as we haven't seen too many urban Depression movies and certainly not recently. Howard deliberately avoided the Ken Burnsian technique used so effectively in ""Seabiscuit"" of editing in newsreel footage or photographs to get across the impact of the Depression. Instead we literally get one headline on a fallen newspaper. <br/><br/>The limited exposition, unfortunately, is put in the mouth of Paddy Considine, as a fictional unemployed broker turned drunken longshoreman and sometime vaguely Socialist community organizer and his dialog and role are just confusing and clumsily inserted. While the bulk of the film takes place 1933- 1935 when the New Deal was just getting off the ground, his stilted mouthing of working class resentments and activist solutions makes Braddock's apolitical responses sound practically Republican, as Braddock, in not seeing a governmental role in either the causes or the solutions, more than once refers to the Depression as a natural phenomenon, as if the docks are the Dust Bowl (and this is the best documentation of the actual work of grappling-hook wielding longshoremen since ""On the Waterfront"" as that accidentally was Braddock's training regimen). The Hooverville in Central Park where Considine somehow ends up is factual, but Mayor LaGuardia did not send in violent cops to break it up; instead the squatters were given work in WPA-type projects.<br/><br/>There's certainly no sense of the desperate optimism attached to Roosevelt's ambitious government employment plans (including bailing out the overwhelmed state home relief offices that Braddock pridefully detests applying to) as if showing how FDR used radio as a lifeline to stir people (and my mom still enthuses how those fireside chats were inspiring) would undercut the visual images of people listening to Braddock's fights.<br/><br/>The lack of period context is not helped by the music. While Thomas Newman's score is effective at building the tensions with each fight, particularly the throbbing percussion, it is simply odd that virtually only one period song is heard on the soundtrack, and the same cynical Eddie Cantor song is used twice, unlike the series ""Carnivale"" which so effectively set the mis en scene with music, or how T. Bone Burnett could have advised, though again perhaps Howard didn't want anything else on his radio other than fight broadcasts.<br/><br/>Despite Howard's manipulative schmaltz that almost drowns the film, it is impossible to come out without cheers and tears and pride in basic human goodness."

","Cinderella MAN. An actual original historical movie, with academy award winners Russel Crowe, Renee Zellwinger, and director Ron Howard. What could go wrong? Other than its slow initial pace of this movie, it eventually catches up when he gets fighting again (so be patient!), its quite an excellent movie. So why the poor box office? I think earlier or later in the year would have fared better financially as its not a typical summer blockbuster (like was Star Wars 3 and Madagascar that it was up against). Still it has the legs and is still not out in the count (excuse the pun), although Russell Crowe (who played fighter Jimmy Braddock) may feel the disappointment, which might have prompted him to throw a phone at a hotel staff worker on opening weekend. Still history will look favorably on this movie and earn some academy award nominations to boot (so far this year there's very little to compete against it). I also think Howard could have traded some earlier drama and continued right till the end of Braddocks career and his final fight against Joe Louis. Which was considered his best test of bravery, even Joe Louis agrees he never fought a tougher fighter, although Braddock would lose in the 7th, (maybe Cinderella man 2 is in the works? Oh never mind). Still that is my only criticism, as this movie will stand the test of time verses the the fickle and dull box office. Please go watch and support this movie, maybe Hollywood will get the message and create more movies like this, instead of crappy ""formula (cookie cutter) type"" movies we are being subjected to!"

In fact, a good reason to release such a film in June is to get reviews that call it the best film of the year so far, because it looks like high art in comparison to films such as Madagascar, Star Wars, and The Longest Yard. It's a solid film with some excellent performances, but it's no Best Picture contender. At best, star Russell Crowe could get a nomination if this ends up a down year for movies, or Paul Giamatti could get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as recognition for his recent work, along with his excellent work in this film.<br/><br/>Crowe and Giamatti are easily the highlights of this film, and without them, it would probably be a mere average film at best. Their combined brilliance pushes Cinderella Man into the above average category, with Crowe in particular inhabiting the real-life character of Jim Braddock stunningly well. Think whatever you want about Russell Crowe the man, but Crowe the actor is quickly becoming the finest actor of his generation (or, at the very least, is in the top percentile). Braddock isn't an easy character to play and make interesting, as Howard seems intent on deifying him, making him so inherently good that he could easily be bland and boring in the hands of a lesser performer.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it's well-worn territory in the standard Ron Howard form. Howard's M.O. is to grab, pull, and squish every ounce of sentimentality out of a story, and assault the viewer with it. It's not subtle, but, usually very effective. He did it in Backdraft, Apollo 13, and his award-winning A Beautiful Mind, and he pulls no punches in Cinderella Man (no pun intended. Or, perhaps it was intended, you decide). Braddock is a hero that all theatre-goers can get behind, beaten down by the Great Depression until he gets one last chance to make it in the boxing ring. He love his family, his wife, his country, and his friends. He's an honest man who is barely able to provide for his family, which kills him. Were it possible to view the movie with a cool detachment, you can see the parts of the movie where Howard is saying to the audience ""okay, cry... NOW!"" It's highly manipulative, but, it's effective. There were even instances that almost had me going.<br/><br/>Howard similarly plays with the hopes and fears of the audience, injecting the movie with legitimate menace and fear in the final climactic match. He wants the audience to feel every blow in the ring, and to fear for the hero's life against the brutal champion Max Baer. And, for the most part, you do. Away from the ring, Howard wants the audience to feel the oppressive struggle many faced during the Great Depression, and pours on the sentiment to accomplish this, and, for the most part, it works.<br/><br/>There's very little new to what Cinderella Man accomplishes. The boxing sequences are proficient, but the boxing-as-metaphor-for-human-struggle has been done many times before. The underdog sports hero capturing the heart of the nation theme was done two years ago in Seabiscuit. It's too bad that the material feels so recycled, because the story of Jim Braddock (nicknamed the Cinderella Man by a sportswriter during his miraculous comeback) is a compelling one. But, since the movie is so familiar, and Howard is so over the top with his sentimentality, the movie is no cinematic classic, and not the Oscar contender it so longs to be.<br/><br/>However, it is an entertaining movie. My advice to those thinking of seeing it is to go in, allow yourself to be manipulated, ride the emotional roller coaster, and don't disrespect yourself in the morning. You'll have a good night out at the movies, and if you were truly inspired by the story it told, do some reading to find out all the details that were fudged in order to make you laugh, cry, and hold your breath."

","Cinderella Man, director Ron Howard's newest film, raises your spirit, along with your blood pressure, as you watch the talented actor Russell Crowe take, and give, tremendous beatings in the boxing ring.<br/><br/>As the ultimate rags to riches story, this film, which tracks the comeback career of boxing legend Jimmy Braddock, is not only about a man's man, and a man's sport, it also jerks those tears until they stream down your face. I predict box office gold: this is the ultimate summer date movie. And yes, even my teenager liked it.<br/><br/>Be aware that the movie has more than a tad of violence. It is about boxing after all. Or is it? This is sports legend come to life with a plot that gave first life to the phrase ""Cinderella story."" Russell Crowe does his stoic warrior best and Paul Giamatti (late of the movie Sideways) is remarkable in his performance as Joe Gould, the boxer Braddock's trainer/manager. Giamatti's everyman face, his exuberance and pain, are all up there on the screen. His performance alone is worth the price of admission. Give this man an Oscar already! At times this movie can be hard to take: The fact that it is based on a true story is not lost on the audience; in fact, it makes the Depression-era scenes of sacrifice and deprivation that much sharper, that more painful. And in these days of (let's not yet call it a) Recession, the faces of the unemployed at the New Jersey Relief office take on a familiarity very close to home.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger's performance is admirable despite being trapped in the paper doll role of loyal wife. In a scene where she and her children salvage wood from a roadside billboard in order to stay warm, her character shows true grit and determination, not the expected shame or lack of pride. I would match this film against John Ford's Grapes of Wrath for its gritty and unflinching portrayal of survival in the Great Depression and the subtle art of conveying dignity in the face of true desperation.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for intense boxing violence and some language. Take everyone over age 14. This is a movie made to be seen on the large screen  the close-ups and camera angles put you inside each fight (which explains why I spent a lot of time looking at the floor!)"
"mg1002","9","1","2","10 June 2005"," Cinderella Man is a Knockout!
","I'll admit, I'm not a fan of Ron Howard's directing efforts. His previous films, A Beautiful Mind, The Missing, and The Grinch, all bored me beyond belief. I found them uninteresting, uncompelling, and too dry for the material. I'm also not the biggest Russell Crowe fan. Gladiator and L.A. Confidential were good, but as a whole, i don't really like him. And Renee Zellweger? I completely dislike her, even if she has been in some good movies. Going into this film, it was against all odds with me, much like Braddock. Yet, Crowe and Howard pull through creating the year's first true Oscar contender.<br/><br/>MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW The film revolves around James Braddock(Crowe), a champion boxer. His career is hitting an all-time high at the start of the film, but soon, the Depression sets in and he loses it all. Flash forward a couple years and Braddock is now living a beaten up, old apartment with his wife, Mae(Zellweger) and their children. Braddock is no longer fighting at Madison Square Garden, but some small venue nobody's heard of. Braddock breaks his hand, yet again, and Braddock's trainer, Joe Gould(Giamatti), is forced to tell him that his boxing license has been revoked. With no job, no boxing license, and no electricity or heat, the Braddock family sets in for a long winter. Desperate to keep his family together, Braddock begs for money from the boxing commissioner and Gould. A boxer set up for a big fight drops out and with no one else to go too, Gould gets Braddock for the fight as a one time deal. Amazingly enough, Braddock wins not only the fight, but the hope of Americans all over as he sets out for a comeback that could prove fatal.<br/><br/>A lot of people love Crowe for his work in Gladiator, but I had always thought his career highlight was in the crime drama, L.A. Confidential until now. Crowe delivers a pitch-perfect performance. I've never been a big fan of movies that involve heavy accents cause most actors can't pull it off. And if they do pull it off, that tends to be the only highlight of the actor's performance. But Crowe amazingly nails the accent and delivers a heartfelt performance that moved audience members to tears. He brings so much depth and heart to the character and makes a legend seem like a real person. He comes alive on screen and makes everyone around him all the more better. This is one of the first Oscar-worthy performances of the year.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger delivers the most annoying performance of the year, topping those in such crap-tastic films such as Be Cool and Alone in the Dark. As I said earlier, most actors will only nail the accent or the emotional performance, but Zellweger manages to fail one-hundred percent here. Every scene she was in she brought down and nearly ruined the film. Yes, she was in big films such as Jerry Maguire and Chicago, but that doesn't make her a good actress. Why she continuously gets cast in films is beyond me. Maybe I am a little biased, considering I find her voice extremely annoying. Thank God she was the only problem in the film. To be honest, I don't think her scenes would've been that big of a loss. The movie is already long as it is. Paul Giamatti also adds to the film. He completely steals the movie every scene he is. He was criminally robbed of an Oscar nomination for his performance in Sideways and if the Academy overlooks him yet again, they will have lost the little respect I still have for them. Giamatti is the highlight of this film not just for his performance, but because of the abundant energy he adds to the film. If only Giamatti were in every film ever made, there would be no bad movies.<br/><br/>As for the direction, Ron Howard is worthy of an Oscar nomination for his incredible direction. I'll admit, Million Dollar Baby is a far superior film. But the boxing scenes in the film were incredible. Howard adds so much emotion through the camera work and I constantly found myself flinching or becoming uneasy after a major hit. The writing is incredible in this film. I haven't heard of the screenwriter before, but if Cliff Hollingsworth keeps writing like this, he could be one of the biggest writers in the upcoming years. His material is so rich and full of depth and emotion. I was awe-struck by the film for not being flashy or full of itself.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man is easily one of the best films so far this year and you deserve to be knocked out if you pass a chance up of seeing this film in theaters. The emotion and depth shine, along with phenomenal performances by Crowe and Giamatti. Not a Ron Howard fan? Don't worry because he is a new director in this film. This is not the kind of film to wait until DVD to see. You need to see it in a gigantic theater full of people with huge speakers and a gigantic picture. The boxing scenes are intense and moving and better than many action films this year so far. Please, don't skip this Cinderella fairy tale."

","i think ron howard is a gifted filmmaker. and i think russel crowe is a very good actor (he really does need to calm the hell down off camera, though -- sheesh) but this was not a *10* or even a *9* in my book. i think the primary reason for it is that i never quite believed any of the characters. somehow no one got under the skin of the story. i don't know whether it was the screenwriter's fault or howard's, but i never felt really committed to any of the characters -- ever.<br/><br/>certainly, there were rousing moments - especially the last title bout. but the labored lead-in was painful. and the oft mentioned powerful emotional interludes fell 70% flat for me.<br/><br/>Crowe is an incredibly charming presence - but that alone can't carry a film.<br/><br/>for my money, if you're looking at moderate to big budget Hollywood movies this summer, CRASH was head and shoulders above Cinderalla Man"

","All I can say about this movie is WOW! Ron Howard and my good friend Russel Crowe have done it again, like the Beautiful Mind both of these gifted men, have transformed a legend into a Classic.I mean the acting and directing was great.Supporting actors were awesome and the film deserves Oscar Nominations, Best Picture included.I will not reveal any details or spoilers, because you must see it, it is a classic.If you liked the acting of ""A Beautiful Mind"", and the directing of the best movie you ever saw, and then multiply that by 1425, you will get this greatness.At first I thought, there was no way Ron Howard could make another movie like A Beautiful Mind, but as soon as I saw, it was like Ron Howard him self, telling me right in the face ""Ahhahaha, you silly, you thought I couldn't make another movie huh? Well I proved you wrong didn't I? Huh, Didn't I?"" and yes he did, Ronnie showed me, he really can make great movies after great movies after great movies, like Pixar makes all those great cartoons.I really recommend this movie as an appetizer to Steven Spielberg's ""War Of The Worlds"", which is totally beyond Cinderella Man, I mean come on it's Steven Spielberg, were are talking about here. :D"
"Sangalina","9","1","2","5 June 2005"," Restore your faith in movies
","As I left the theater after seeing Cinderella Man, I was perplexed by a feeling I couldn't identify. It wasn't until I was in my car beginning the journey home that I realized what I had been feeling. I had been moved by this movie. I had experienced the full-hearted, satisfied, thrilled sensation of having seen something wonderful.<br/><br/>It is a cliché that people need heroes. Cliché it may be, but people do need heroes; more so during times of great trouble. Cinderella Man tells the story of a man who became a hero for millions of Americans during the Great Depression. As the film opens, James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) is a boxer on the way up. The year is 1929 and he is on the fast track to a contention bout for the Light Heavyweight world championship title. But the time frame of the film quickly changes to 1933 and we learn that Braddock was soundly beaten early on his path to the title and is considered washed up by the 1930's. The Depression is in full, horrible swing and Braddock works on the loading docks when he can. He also gets an occasional boxing match, which helps pay the bills and keep poverty just barely outside the door. He is a family man, in love with his wife, Mae (Renee Zellweger) and a caring father to his children. He boxes because, as a newspaper headline informs us, 15,000,000 people are out of work. He boxes when he shouldn't, with a hand not properly healed from a break and it shows in his performance. In a bout which is, to Braddock, just about the money to pay bills, he re-breaks his hand and spends the rest of the fight dancing and weaving. Because of his poor performance, the fight is stopped. The fight promoter, Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill, whose face will certainly be recognizable to many viewers), enraged at Braddock's poor showing, revokes his license to fight. Just like that, the main source of income, solvency and pride for Braddock and his family is gone.<br/><br/>Braddock's situation, as it did for so many Americans in those years only worsens. Braddock humbles himself more than once, but counts it all as worth it to keep his family together. After weathering a Winter that almost destroys the family, Braddock is visited by his former Trainer/Manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti). Gould brings news that the boxing commission is willing to allow Braddock to fight one more fight because they are desperate for a last minute replacement opponent for a fight the next day at Madison Square Garden. For Braddock, it is a chance to make $250, and also a chance to perform his swan song at Madison Square Garden. The result of that fight isn't hard to imagine, but it is thrilling to watch. And as Braddock's story unfolds, it provides humor, exceptional thrills and deep satisfaction for the viewer.<br/><br/>It is always a difficult task for filmmakers to tell a sports related story. Every single cast and crew member must be at the peak of their game if it is to be done successfully. Sports fan viewers will want a movie filled with sporting (in this case boxing) scenes, but a two hour film cannot be sustained by just sports scenes. Otherwise, why not just put a recording of the fight/baseball game/soccer match on screen for two hours. No, a sports movie must have an underlying reason for us to root for the hero of the tale. To root for a person you must understand what drives them, what makes them happy and what saddens them. In this case, it is the mix of the tale of the boxing ring and the tale of the wedding ring that gives this story it's depth. For Braddock lives to provide as well as he can for his wife and family in some of the worst times in recent history. Without doubt, the boxing scenes are thrilling and well staged. Each punch reverberates through the viewer's senses and shatters a little more of their reticence. Until finally the viewer is completely immersed in the battle between the opponents. Not just because it is thrilling to watch, but because we know what every punch thrown and landed means to Braddock.<br/><br/>The film is executed so well that it is worth reminding oneself that the writers, actors and director of Cinderella Man are so often so superb at what they do that one might begin to take it for granted. Instead, savor the grace and recognize the purity that is this movie. From Akiva Goldsman's (A Beautiful Mind) deft screenplay (co-written with Cliff Hollingsworth from a story by Hollingsworth) to Ron Howard's willingness to allow his actor's eyes to speak for them when words would be less effective, to actors Zellweger, Giamatti and Crowe. Crowe, in particular surprises as he delves into territory we have not seen him visit before. Whereas in the past he has excelled at playing tortured, wise or strong souls, here he inhabits the nice, loving man that is Braddock. A skin that is as difficult to wear as any of the others he has slipped into in the past.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man is more than an antidote to all the bluster and hype that is the Summer movie season. It is a truly great film on many levels. One that may leave you with a feeling you haven't had in a long time when leaving a theater. Allow me to identify it for you. You have been moved. Enjoy."

","Cinderella Man is movie-making at it's finest! Although I'm not a fan of boxing or so-called ""boxing movies"", I adored this movie, both for it's story, real-life basis of the story, perfect acting, beautiful direction, and gorgeous camera work. It had stellar acting turns from the always believable and amazing Russell Crowe, the adorably sincere Renee Zellweger and the engaging Paul Giamatti. The chemistry between all was evident, enhancing the believability of the movie. The boxing scenes were incredible - I felt like I was in the ring. <br/><br/>Russell Crowe's acting is a teaching lesson for all wannabe actors out there. He embodies his roles, does the hard, tedious prep work, and has yet to turn in a mediocre performance. Actors take note!<br/><br/>Loved it! Best movie of the year!"
"butinaseat","10","1","2","4 June 2005"," American Cinema at its Finest
","If you care in the least about American Cinema - Go see this film! It is absolutely spectacular, and exactly the kind of thing we must encourage Hollywood to make. A must see for all ages it's an emotion evoking story about where America has been and where it is going. Superbly balanced, It pulls at the heart-string, makes you grind your teeth in suspense, and make you want to jump from your seat. My audience actually applauded this movie TWICE; once at the end and also during the movie at a particularly poignant moment. Now get this: The women liked it. My audience was a good mix of all ages, and after the film I heard a woman in her forties say ""This is the first boxing movie I ever liked"", another random woman answered her, ""Yeah because it wasn't really about boxing"". And she was right. It is a redemption story, one of the best ever put on screen. And it had just the right amount of solid boxing action, again very well done. They didn't cheat. No fancy camera work of frenetic editing was used in the normal lame attempts to punch up the action. This was shot true, with smooth shots, cut at a pace that allowed you to absorb what you were seeing. No jerky cliché steady cam that makes your head hurt. It was visually perfect. And what a story! A true story. An American story. I can't remember any film that so pulls the viewer in to the difficulty that so many suffered during the great depression of the twenties. This film really made you feel it, without forcing it, without contrivance. Just a truly excellent film on all levels. I had tears in my eyes by the midpoint and just couldn't make them go away. Bravo! Go see this film."
"thomascapital","10","1","2","4 June 2005"," An excellent film that recalls the hardships that most Americans...
","The reality of the film is the best feature. For those of us that are too young to have lived through the depression (my parents did), it is hard to relate to the sheer enormity of the economic collapse that occurred from 1929 through 1936/7. Especially in light of the great country that we have become: EVERYONE has color TV's, and even those living below the poverty line, have it far better than the poor and even middle class of the 1930's.<br/><br/>Crowe provides a very credible boxer of yester-year and Rene Z is simply perfect! Paul G is his typical excellent as a main supporting character, you really take a strong liking to him, as he believes in his friend, Braddock.<br/><br/>The only criticism is that the movie editing lingers a bit too much on the fear that Mrs. Braddock displays. No, I am not into the gore, but the movie was about very tough times and how one man survived the Great Depression and survived some very brutal fights, more than 100 in his lifetime. The average Heavy Weight boxer today will have less than 25 fights in his career and less than 10 fights after he takes the title.<br/><br/>Go see the film, as it is worth the full price admission. We plan on purchasing the DVD once it becomes available.<br/><br/>Good film watching!"
"maflynn9","10","1","2","3 June 2005"," Exciting and Magical Directing, Acting and Writing Moments
","When I chose this film, I was looking forward to a predictable feel good story with a few actors I enjoy watching. I knew this was a Ron Howard/Brian Grazer project (now I see Penny Marshall produced alongside them) and I looked forward to that as well. What I didn't expect is to be surprised continually in and at this film.<br/><br/>I didn't know the Jim Braddock story going in, yet I don't believe that this would have taken from my enjoyment if I had. The writing, directing and acting of the character played by Paul Giamatti was unexpected, exciting and deserves a best supporting actor award without question. Russell is as expected magnetic and perfect for this role. He and Paul together are dynamite.<br/><br/>Ron Howard added at least one special effect that was subtle but shot through in a poignant moment to enhance the narrative in a surprising and wonderful way. Howard holds the film to a realist, tight narrative that doesn't overplay a card and especially not in moments that you would most expect him to. But he also lets the film breathe, thus allowing for a film over 2 hours, which I generally resent, feeling the length is more about flexing a director's ego with floppy biceps (and lazying, indulgent editing). But with Howard I did not squirm and place him on a red flag list, because egomaniacal driven, lazy editing is not the reason and it doesn't feel even once that is why it is longer than the usual 90 minutes. He wants to cover the full spectrum of this story and it's an enjoyable journey with him-with a treasure like this I am glad he went with his instincts.<br/><br/>Howard lets the emotion of the piece drive its own in the viewer, as opposed to the force feeding that one gets so much of these days from Hollywood; Howard wowed and surprised me with this directorial decision, so rarely risked these days. I believe the breathing room he gives the audience will pay off generously for him though and add to the list director instincts that will signal him more and more over time as the great artist that he is and will probably not be noticed for until long after his time.<br/><br/>This movie is a great inspiration to anyone. If you have ever felt as though you needed renewed faith in yourself or even just in the story tellers of our time go see this film. This is a movie for men and women a like. This is going to be a word of mouth film for sure!"

I didn't mind the length at all. Max Baer's character came off as quite a pig, and I was pleased to see him get thunked and his sputum flying.

"TheMovieMark","10","1","2","3 June 2005"," Truly one of the best underdog stories of all time
","You want my review of Cinderella Man? Here you go: Best. Boxing. Movie. Ever. Period. And yes, I'm aware of the existence of Rocky. As entertaining as Stallone's little slugfest is, Cinderella Man is just better on all fronts - better acting, better drama, and more realistic boxing. I've boxed before, and I can say with a straight face that this is the most realistic boxing I've ever seen in a movie. Plus, and this is the best part, it's a true story. And quite an amazing one at that. Why don't we have cool sports stories like this anymore?<br/><br/>Nowadays all we have to cheer for are overpaid athletes who are willing to sacrifice an entire season of their sport if they don't get a few million more bucks to line their pockets. But James J. Braddock? He fought for something more. He fought to put milk on the table, to put a little more distance between his children and the street, to have a better way of life.<br/><br/>You want drama? Cinderella Man effectively shows us the impact of the Great Depression on the average family. This was a time when unemployment hit a record high of 15,000,000 people. Once Braddock is unable to box, he is left hoping and praying for a one-day pay at the docks. When he can't pay the milk bill, his wife has to dilute what little they have with water to stretch it as far as they can.<br/><br/>Then when Braddock doesn't have the money to pay his power bill during the snowy winter, his wife sends the children to live with her sister, breaking a promise Braddock made to his son. Desperate to get his children back, Braddock is forced to get government assistance and to beg everybody he knows for $20 so he can pay his bills and get his children back.<br/><br/>Braddock's family is struggling, so you can feel how huge it is when he's offered the chance to make $250 as a last-minute fill-in against the 2nd-ranked contender. You want excitement? Well, this is when the boxing side of the story really kicks in. Braddock gets a very surprising knockout, he gets his boxing license back, and he starts training to compete in some elimination fights for the championship.<br/><br/>Everything builds up to the championship match against the feared Max Baer, a man who is so brutal that he has killed two men in the ring. And he's not nice about it either. He mocks Braddock, talks about taking care of his wife after killing him in the ring, and reminds James that ""people die in fairy tales all the time.""<br/><br/>Once the championship fight starts - whew. Not to sound too corny, but it really does feel like you're at the fight. When the crowd in the movie starts chanting ""Braddock, Braddock, Braddock,"" I wanted to start chanting also. But I didn't because that'd just be too gay. But I was completely pulled into the action.<br/><br/>""But Johnny, I'm not a huge fan of boxing! I doubt I'd like a boxing movie.""<br/><br/>But it's much more than a ""boxing movie."" Neither Stephanie nor my sister are boxing fans, but they both loved it. I'm not a huge boxing fan either, but if boxing had fighters and stories like this these days then I certainly would be. So yes, in my opinion it's the best boxing movie I've ever seen. But quite simply it's just a great movie with a great story that happens to be told within the confines of the boxing world.<br/><br/>This is as upbeat and inspirational as Million Dollar Baby is depressing. After watching Cinderella Man you'll leave the theater feeling good about life and being inspired to try to accomplish something yourself. For a brief second you might toy with the idea of getting your fat, chubby little legs off the couch and doing something with life other than watching movies and playing video games all the time. It may be a fleeting fancy, but the spark will be there.<br/><br/>My 20-year-old cousin walked out of the theater claiming, ""I want to be a boxer now."" Mr. Shade and I both want to start kickboxing again. And everybody was doing an Internet search afterwards to find out where we could read or watch more about the real-life James J. Braddock. And you know what? I'm even man enough to admit to the following conversation after the movie:<br/><br/>Johnny: So, did you cry? Amber: I got teary-eyed when he was telling his children bye. Steph: Me too.<br/><br/>*Stephanie and Amber stare at me for a few seconds*<br/><br/>Steph: Well? Johnny: What? Amber: Come on... Johnny: All right, fine. My eyes started to perspire just a little. You happy?<br/><br/>Hey, don't look at me like that, guys. I have feelings just like everybody else. Like Brian's Song, this is one of those movies where you can get a few goosebumps, get a little misty with ""eye sweat,"" and still keep your man card afterwards."

His wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) had prayed for years that he would quit boxing, before becoming permanently injured. To support his family, Braddock works as a laborer at the docks, but he still has a dream to box. Several years after his last fight, Braddock's old manager wants him to be a last-minute substitute to fight against the second-ranked world contender. In this case, Braddock is one of those hungry fighters who astonishes everyone by winning the fight. Braddock is back in the ring and begins to win all his fights against younger, stronger, and heavier boxers. In a sports article, Braddock is named the ""Cinderella Man"" for his miraculous comeback. Braddock gets a chance to fight the heavyweight champion, Max Baer (Craig Bierko), for the title. Max Baer had killed two men in the ring, and everybody believed Braddock would be number three. As the underdog, Braddock became the champion of the downtrodden masses.<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies of the year. This time, the ads about the movie are correct and not hyped. The storyline and acting is great. You are taken back in time, and you feel the pain of the Great Depression. The fighting is brutal and looks so real. Actually, I was tired after the movie, because I was fighting with Braddock. This movie will win several Academy Awards and is a must see. (Universal Pictures, Run time 2:24, Rated PG-13) (10/10)"
"ToomuchtothinK","9","1","2","31 May 2005"," Beautifully put together!
","Ron Howard is a genius! I went to an advanced screening of this film. The story of Jimmy Braddock is epic. The film picks up in 1923 and carries you through the Great Depression focusing on the life and times of Jimmy and his family. An emotional roller-coaster, at times I felt so sorry for him and his family. Near the end of the movie audience members couldn't control their emotions. I don't want to give anything away, but this is a Must See. Russell Crowe gives a stunning performance of a humble and loving father of three. Renee Zelwiger deserves an Oscar she too is terrific. Do not wait until this comes out on video go experience it in your local theatre!"
"espenshade55","9","1","2","30 May 2005"," This was a masterpiece
","There have been several great boxing movies made throughout the years, particularly Raging Bull and the more recent Million Dollar Baby, Cinderella Man is right up there with the best of them.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard has proved himself as being one of the best film directors of our time. he has a great understanding in the complex aesthetics of film making, different film stocks, and an uncanny ability to work with actors. Much of the film was stylized but not to the point that it subtracted from the effectiveness of the story, rather it enhanced it.<br/><br/>The cinematography was very well done for the most part. Simply the choice of film stock gave scene's new meaning and an enhanced feel. The only problem was unnecessary camera movement. It is definitely justified during the actual boxing sequences but there were several scene's that were not very intense that still had the camera bouncing around all over the place. It served as a distraction more than a dramatic effect.<br/><br/>The performances were really good. Russell Crow has again shown the extent of his talent in a nearly flawless portrayal of Braddok. I haven't been too thrilled with Renee Zelwigger recently, especially after her woefully over the top performance in Cold Mountain but Ron Howard was able to bring her down to a believable level. Paul Gamatti is still one of the best, yet most overlooked actors out there and he gave another Oscar caliber performance in this film.<br/><br/>Still, the story in and of itself was great. In most cases when it comes boxing movies the main character's are complete schmucks and completely unlikable. Braddok was one boxer that was also a truly good person, a man fighting for his home and his family, simply for the ability to live. He was grateful for everything that he had and his story was definitely worth telling.<br/><br/>I hope people don't look at this and say, ""just another boxer film"". because that isn't how I saw it. This was a true work of art about a man who's resolve, perseverance, and devotion allowed him to capture the imaginations of an entire nation. This was a truly great film."

","I saw a sneak preview last night and was blown away. This may be Ron Howard's best movie. I knew the story of Jim Braddock before I saw it, but I was still on the edge of my seat guessing the ending. Ron Howard has now done two films(Cinderella Man and Apollo 13) where the true life outcome is known by many. But somehow he keeps the tension.<br/><br/>The casting is flawless. Russell Crowe is more convincing as Jim Braddock than he was as Nash in A Beautiful Mind. Paul Giamatti is amazing as well. Even the actors that play the children were great. I haven't even mentioned Renee Zewelleger. I was afraid that she would go over the top like she did in Cold Mountain, but she nailed it.<br/><br/>I have never seen The Depression filmed better. Howard makes us feel The Depression, and it hurts. To see what Jim Braddock had to go through to get the film conclusion is gut wrenching. The only negative about the movie is subplot about a relationship that JIm has with a co-worker on the Jersey docks.<br/><br/>This might be the best sports movie I have ever seen...and its much more than just a sports movie."

","Like mythical alchemists, Russell Crowe, Ron Howard, & Brian Grazer have once again contrived to make movie gold from what could have been mere lead. Their latest collaboration, Cinderella Man, is PURE magic, despite the fact that from the title alone, most could discern the outcome. The riches-to-rags-to-riches theme may be more than familiar to us, but is never more convincingly retold than here.<br/><br/>Based on fact, executed with uncanny skill, every scene of the movie, even the most brutal of boxing matches, is riveting. You can't take your eyes off the action, just in case you'll miss a single twitch of James Braddock (Crowe's) face or the infectious enthusiasm of a superb Paul Giammatti as his manager, Joe Gould. <br/><br/>As in every role he's played to date, Crowe morphs entirely into his character. His body is sculpted to appear as if he's just stepped out of a '30s newsreel. If anyone has ever doubted the actor's commitment to a role, they need look no further than when he performs his training scenes. Kudos to the surgeon who performed a second shoulder repair upon him, due to the recurrence of an old injury which threatened to halt the production in its infancy. He should be acknowledged as one of the sorcerers responsible for preventing the project from dissolving into a puff of expensive smoke. Of enormous significance, there is also an elusive but palpable humility in Braddock's portrayal, a quality which we have heretofore not seen in a Russell Crowe film, happy proof that the man many call 'greatest living actor' continues to learn & evolve.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the remainder of the superb cast: Renee Zellweger as Braddock's distraught & devoted wife, Craig Bierko as brutal playboy Max Baer (factual or not?), & Bruce McGill as slick promoter Jimmy Johnston, to name a few. Just as during any great sporting event, all the players perform to their highest abilities, the bar set by Crowe or perhaps, their mere collaboration. It matters not. The whole far outweighs the sum of the parts. Art direction, Costume design, Cinematography, Sound effects, & Score should be listed among these, since the look & sound of Cinderella Man is virtually another composite character, another ingredient in the magic formula. Let's hope the alchemy comes full circle, that the creators' bright & shiny alloy is fashioned into statuettes next February."

","May be the best film of the year (it is only May). Great performances by the entire cast. The boxing scenes are the best I've seen, and the emotional aspect of the story brings it all together. As a nation, I think we have forgotten what the depression of the thirties did to us. All the lives it ruined. This movie shows how one family was able to break out of all the squalor, and still remain a family unit. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this movie. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, and Paul Giamatti are all Oscar worthy. This movie has it all. It is Ron Howard's best film. Special note about the music score by Thomas Newman. It really drives the entire film with its Irish themes."
"bigkingtut2000","9","1","2","29 May 2005"," I just watched a sneak preview of CM...and I: Loved it!
","If you think your going to just a boxing movie you have underestimated the story of James J. Braddock. Damon Runyan, the great scribe who specialized in writing about the unusual characters that spiced the stories of life in New York, thought the true story of James J. Braddock...the Jersey fighter with a heart that wouldn't quit...to be that of a Cinderella story. Braddock, a successful light heavyweight fighter in the late 20's career took a dive with the stock market...and soon, instead of leading the fat life of a successful professional boxer...lost his skills due to injury and his money to the depression. So, we see the beginning of the movie with Braddock, a dedicated family man...knocking out Tuffy Griffith, ironically, I almost jumped out of my theater chair...for Mr Griffith was in my fathers Marine Corps outfit in WWII. As Braddock returns home to his lovely wife, finely portrayed by Rene Zellwiger, he is seen taking off his watch, after the 1929 fight. We are transported in time to four years later...and the suburban home is replaced by a shanty tenement in Jersey, where Braddock and family are faced with the harsh reality of living in depression era America. Not enough food for his family or enough milk for them to drink...Braddock is now a club fighter...routinely getting beaten by lesser opponents for fifty dollar purses. His last fight was deemed no contest as Braddock breaks his hand in three places but continues to fight on..until the ref stops the contest. Braddock's purse was withheld and his hand placed in a cast...with no money or steady work...services are disconnected and the final humiliation, his wife has to send their children to other family members to survive. The harsh reality of depression pulls no punches and Braddock and his family and religion/faith, is ultimately put to the test. Forced to beg in the club at Madison Square Garden..he needed forty dollars to get his electricity turned on and have his family returned. Crowe, one of the finest actors around to day...was again magnificent as the genuinely honest and modest Braddock. Whose Cinderella story is a remarkable tale told masterfully by Ron Howard. Go see it and see it often... I just watched the actual Baer vs Braddock heavyweight championship fight and the clowning, talkative Baer did just that...he was penalized for low blows and backhanding tactics in the fight...Baer took Braddock for granted and paid the price with his title. Also note, that Braddock lost his title to Joe Louis. For Louis to get the fight he had to give 10% of all his future fight earnings to Braddock. I don't think that deal was arranged by Braddock...but more his manager."
"Homeric","5","2","7","7 June 2005"," Good Film, not Great
","Cinderella Man is a good film but not a great one. Crowe is his usual excellent self in a role that would be a mere cliché with a lessor actor, however all the other roles are just that. The film is enjoyable on a strictly feel good level, which is fine, but because its aim is so obviously manipulative (ie I expected Dickens' Tiny Tim on crutches to show up at any moment) it becomes very formulaic and entirely predictable. Nothing wrong with that however, just nothing special. It is definitely worth seeing for Crowe's performance and the excellent set decoration, but it is not one of the top ten movies of 2005....at least I hope not."

It is worth seeing for the acting and directing alone. Russell Crowe and Rene Zellweger give good performances, but they are pretty much what we expect from them. Paul Giamatti gives a great performance in a supporting role that outshines the stars. Ron Howard does the best directing job of his career.<br/><br/>I hadn't seen an uplifting depression era film since Seabiscuit. I hadn't seen an underdog boxing film since Million Dollar Baby. Both those films are better than Cinderella Man.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man starts off being more about the people trying to survive the Great Depression but ends with a long extended fight scene and I left the theater feeling like I just saw a remake of Rocky.<br/><br/>Despite all of it's attributes, Cinderella Man does not have enough originality to make it a great film. Still, it's a nice film to see in the summer because it is one of the few films geared towards adults instead of children."

","This was one of those films that began really well but ultimately felt rather conventional. It's basically a depression-era 'Rocky' directed with little risk by Ron Howard. Russell Crowe is competent as usual, but is never allowed to fully break loose. He does have one scene, (MINOR SPOILERS) where he is is left literally begging for money that had me in tears. If only the rest of the film matched the intensity of that scene. Renee Zellwege is bland in a straightforward role as the loving wife. The fight scenes are good though uninspired.

","An interesting story about an interesting man.<br/><br/>This is a nice true story about a boxer who was decent, likable and honest. That in itself makes it unusual for a boxing film.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, Crowe is on fine form and nails the character being equally believable when he is on top of the world or when he is beat down and desperate and everything in between. The supporting cast almost all deliver fine realistic performances with Giamatti being especially good.<br/><br/>The one issue with the acting, or casting, is Renée Zellweger. It is quite distracting to see someone with no facial movement trying to emote, the best she manages is to crinkle her eyes and look like she is in pain.<br/><br/>The writing is good with the plot flowing at speed always showing the darkness of the era but not trying to bludgeon us into depression, the dialogue at times is snappy and funny and at other times is genuinely touching.<br/><br/>Braddock does seem to have been an exceptional man pushed to the limits by hard times and it is easy to like him.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are very well choreographed with the brutality of extreme close up being interspersed with commentary, tactics and other extraneous detail.<br/><br/>All in all a great film, not mind-blowing but good to watch."

"Bunuel1976","7","1","3","11 March 2006"," Cinderella Man (2005) ***
","A pretty good and surprisingly compelling biopic which, apart from obviously emphasizing the traditional elements of a boxing drama for commercial purposes, tries to faithfully portray its background of 1930s Depression America; this it does in meticulous detail but also excessive sentimentality, I think. Besides, the 'modern' (i.e. mannered) performances of its stars and the occasionally over-emphatic direction rather serve to detach oneself from that particular environment  which is not at all what the director intended! <br/><br/>Still, the film's trump card remains its technically proficient and tremendously exciting boxing sequences (particularly the smooth transition from one fight to the next and the lengthy final bout between Braddock and Max Baer, though the latter is rather lazily presented as a one-dimensional villain in order to put the audience, no pun intended, firmly in Braddock's corner)."
"The_Void","8","1","3","1 February 2006"," Hard-hitting boxing, and sentiment that works!
","Ron Howard has made a name for himself for directing dull, politically correct Academy award favourites; and it is with that in mind that I decided that I didn't want to see this film. But I'm glad I changed my mind! Cinderella Man is more than just a follow-up to Clint Eastwood boxing success with 'Million Dollar Baby', and reunites the 'Best Picture winning team of Russell Crowe and Ron Howard, for the story of depression era boxer, Jim J. Braddock. Braddock was more than just a boxer in his time; he became the hope of the United States for the working class; so you've got to expect a lot of sentiment from this film. But, that is where Cinderella Man stands out; both from other films in it's class, and the rest of Howard's oeuvre - there is sentiment here, but it's not of the 'fake' kind - Howard builds it up excellently. By keeping the focus on the main character, the director is able to explore both the central figure and the era in which the film is set; and after showing the audience Braddock's first fight, and the situation that he and his family have found themselves in; it really is impossible not to only feel for this man, but get behind him as he tries to fight his way to the World Heavyweight Title.<br/><br/>I don't profess to be the biggest fan of Russell Crowe, but you can always count on a strong lead performance from him, and that is what he delivers in this film. His acting here isn't great; but he portrays the right image that you would associate with his character, and his in-ring performance massively outweighs his performance outside of it. The fights in Cinderella Man are well choreographed, and thanks to some excellent first person cinematography; are always exciting, and it really feels like the boxers are actually being hurt! The support cast isn't bad, and it's Paul Giamatti who stands out the most there. His Oscar nomination seems more to be compensation for the film not receiving a 'Best Picture' nomination than anything; but as I say, he's not bad. Renee Zellweger is the weak link for me; I haven't been impressed with her so far, and her role here doesn't even give her a chance to change that. This film could be classified as 'predictable', but it wasn't for me as I've never heard of Jim Braddock, and therefore don't know the results of his fights; meaning that anything could have happened. Overall; I dint rate this as the best film of the year, but it is a milestone for its director. It's taken him a while, but Ron Howard has finally directed a great film."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","31 December 2005"," Inspiring story of a boxer who was a husband, father, and gentleman first.
","Superb movie!!<br/><br/>I am not a boxing fan, and I didn't take the time to look up the actual biography of Jim Braddock. But knowing it is an Opie film, I suspect it is pretty accurate. We have seen so many spoiled, brash athletes, sometimes even criminal, it is refreshing to see that you can be a top fighter and still be a gentle, humble man. When something good happened, he may just say, ""Well maybe it was the luck of the Irish.""<br/><br/>Russell Crowe was already established as one of the very best actors working today, and this role as Jim Braddock is no exception. As he did in ""The Insider"" and ""The Beautiful Mind"", the character he becomes is believable, no longer the actor Crowe. Renée Zellweger also shines as the caring wife and mother Mae Braddock. Paul Giamatti is his manager, Joe Gould, in a very effective performance. <br/><br/>Braddock was one of the best fighters in the mid- to late-1920s, but the depression hit him hard as it did most everyone. He had invested his winnings in the stock market, to provide a secure future for his family, and lost it all. Occasionally getting day work, he was barely able to keep heat in the apartment and food on the table. He broke his hand in a fight, and lost the confidence of promoters. At one point, just to save his family, he went to former associates and literally begged to get a few dollars together to turn the heat and lights back on. All though this he didn't complain, he knew it wasn't anyone's fault, he just did the best he could.<br/><br/>Then, a bit old for the ring, in the mid-1930s got a chance for a fight when one opponent came up injured. Surprising everyone, he won, and later became contender for the world championship. A scene shows him going back through the welfare line, to re-pay the money that had been given to him when he was indigent. In the title match, he was matched against Max Baer (Craig Bierko) who had actually killed a man in the ring. <br/><br/>SPOILERS. The movie ends with that fight. It was a 15-rounder, as history knows Braddock won the fight in a unanimous decision, A very well choreographed fight. Braddock went on to be a successful businessman."
"MoviePopcornCostsTooMuch","Null","1","3","29 December 2005"," Another lifeless Howard film. A really expensive episode of 'BIOGRAPHY'.
","Everyone that I know who has seen Cinderella Man shares the same opinion as mine - an okay movie, but not really worth recommending or wasting money on to see. It's pretty lifeless and limps along at a snails pace. There is zero emotional impact delivered. What could Ron Howard possibly know about poverty? I find it like all his movies - slow, deliberate and passionless; sure, I shed a tear when Russell Crowe's mad professor gets the Nobel prize but that's about it. The production designer and art director are the only champions in this movie and should get nominated for their beautiful work.<br/><br/>I've read many of the comments and am pretty confident that the slew of '10s' you see as votes for this movie are the result of some massive email forward that got everyone involved with the movie to vote. Even people that do like it would never give it a 10. But 35% of IMDb voters give it a ten? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Save your money. Ron Howard grew up with a craft table next to him, what does he know about hunger? It's like he just picks up a script and says to himself 'ooh, this would be good with a crane shot, and this would be great at 60 frames a second, and when they kiss, we'll play some violins' He's like a movie professor that knows all of the ingredients to a good film but can't mix them together properly. There's no synergy. He will always make films because Hollywood likes him. Mr. Aw Shucks Howard wants to make a movie? Sure, is 100 million enough? Why Roger Ebert touts this movie so much is beyond me. The only reason I can figure is because it's the kind of movie they want Hollywood to make more of - big old fashioned sets - larger than life story - James Horner does the score. It's got all the elements of a great movie but it ISN'T!! I truly believe that if somebody else had directed this it would have been a great movie. It's an unbelievable but true story. But it was really just a way for Howard to waste 120 million of Universal's money.<br/><br/>Let's hope he doesn't screw up The DaVinci code."
"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","1","3","28 June 2005"," Channeling Frank Capra
","Cinderella Man is the kind of irresistible malarkey that Hollywood used to be founded on - the kind of cornball triumph-of-the-common man stuff Capra used to peddle, presented with all the slickness modern Hollywood can muster. It's almost impossible not to root for its hero, James Braddock, a punching-bag who becomes Heavyweight Champeen despite being old, broke and saddled with three kids and a nagging wife. And it's almost equally impossible not to snicker at one's own gullibility at being carried along by the movie's tide of populist bull-crap emotion.<br/><br/>Ron Howard is better at this kind of movie than almost anyone, even Spielberg, mostly because with Howard you don't have to worry about any messy imagination getting in the way. Too much original thinking would just bog-down a movie like Cinderella Man, which needs to be all about the surface emotions, and there's no director in Hollywood better qualified to skate along the exterior of a story than Howard. To call Howard proficient would be understating things - he has achieved a level of skill at standard storytelling that can only be described as super-proficient. There isn't a moment of Cinderella Man that doesn't display Howard's command of the medium - and there isn't a moment that doesn't demonstrate his complete mediocrity as a cinematic thinker. They used to call guys like this ""shooters"" back in the day, directors who knew how to interpret a script without jazzing things up too much. There are moments in Cinderella Man where Howard seems to be injecting a bit of style, but what he's really doing is aping. The boxing scenes may recall Raging Bull for a second or two, but mostly they're just competent. At times the depiction of Depression-era squalor may appear grimly realistic, but there's always a storybook sheen over everything, the sense of reality filtered through a strictly pedestrian, basically clean-minded point-of-view. Howard may seem to want to press the violence, the seedier aspects of the story, but he's too decent and unperverse to really achieve this. There's no sense whatsoever of the real brutality of boxing, just the mock-brutality of movie-boxing filmed so close-in that we can't see how bad the actors' footwork is.<br/><br/>The film revolves around three strong central performances. Russell Crowe brings warmth to Braddock, the lovable lug, and has the right physical presence to capture the character's bruising prowess. Braddock's manager/trainer, Joe Gould, is played by Paul Giamatti with a crackling Lee Tracy sense of verbal acrobatics and timing, his rapport with Crowe becoming almost vaudevillian. And Renee Zellweger plays Crowe's loyal, long-suffering wife Mae with enough of her signature screwy-but-down-to-earth charm to distract us from the fact that the character is basically a fretful stereotype. It's a novelty for three such dynamic performers to find their way into the same movie - yet despite the strength of these performances there is a nagging sense of shallowness to the characterizations. We get to like Jim Braddock, to see his honorable nature and his toughness, but we never get very deep into the character, we never get a sense of the undercurrents of violence and rage that must, at least partly, motivate him. The movie goes out of its way to visualize the character's motivations at key moments, showing us flashes from his miserable home-life while he's knocking the snot out of someone, but this is no more than psychological window-dressing. Crowe is certainly a powerful enough actor to bring us deeper inside Braddock, but the mainstream, audience-friendly conception, and Ron Howard's own populist tendencies, preclude this. The film needs Braddock to be a straight-forward hero, the champion of the common-man, and that is what we are given. The actors only skim the surfaces of their characters, portraying the kinds of emotions that will contribute to the sense of inspiration. It's effective acting but it's not very interesting acting.<br/><br/>The same could be said about the movie as a whole - it's effective but not very interesting. It gets the job done as they say, but the job it's doing is a rather routine, unremarkable one."

Everything was done very well, nothing extraordinary. The story was EXACTLY what I expected. I know that this is a true story, so they can't really invent something, but I was maybe hoping for an angle on the story that I wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into details about the movie.

"bobbobwhite","6","1","3","13 June 2005"," Typical Ron Howard commercial crowd pleaser
","Ron Howard makes the most commercial, feel good, crowd pleasing movies of today. That does not mean that they are the most thoughtful, insightful, expert, soulful, or innovative, but just that they are well crafted, basic and timeless morality tales that will be just as watchable 20 or 30 years down the road, as our hard wired human nature doesn't change enough in order to make his films outdated in that short time. His films are like ""The Wizard of Oz"" in their simple old fashioned morality that we quietly love but won't admit to anyone, and just as timeless. That is Cinderella Man in a nutshell.<br/><br/>However, I can only stomach about one of his sugary films every few years, and am thankful that it takes him about that long to get another one out. Cinderella Man showed Braddock as a saint worthy of being selected the next pope, not a real man with faults, and even if it was a good tale it still hit that spot in me that yells, ""no way!"" History shows Braddock to have been a decent man and very tough fighter, but he had many well documented human failings that were not shown at all in the film. And the many shots of long wet kisses and fond caresses with his always responsive wife.....hot married romance with 3 starving kids and no food or heat or money?.......again, ""are you kidding?""! But the gals just eat this kind of phony stuff up and add greatly to ticket sales.<br/><br/>My main concern was the same as with all phonied-up Hollywood films of today...the human body just realistically can't take anything near the brutal punishment these films show it can.... innumerable full force head punches, bomb explosions, hundreds of bullets, head on car wrecks or plunges off cliffs....and the lead character walks away just fine every time, just like Braddock did in this one after taking enough hard head punches to kill a hundred men. All baloney, but kids unfortunately believe a lot of it and sometimes kill themselves acting it out.<br/><br/>This film was a human cartoon, no different than animated cartoons from Disney or Pixar.....with all of them having about the same believability, but it's the way Howard likes to see life through his films. The truth is, he never left Mayberry and Mayberry likes simple morality stories that end happily ever after, every single time."
"riderpridethemovie","7","1","3","11 June 2005"," Bouts with Depression
","What is it about boxing stories that captivate filmmakers so? Because I am starting to feel like I've had my brain knocked loose watching these things. I realize they offer an easy device to externalize an actor's character, and they allow for lots of crazy hand-held shots in a smoky arena, but enough is enough. Do something different with the genre already. Million Dollar Baby substituted a girl for a man, but then fell into the same trap of clichés: the training, the rise to the big break, the title fight. Fortunately it wasn't really about fighting and transcended the average boxing sequences. The sequences in Cinderella Man are technically impressive enough, and so they should be: they were lifted almost directly from Raging Bull: one of the greatest films ever made. Russell Crowe's character is full of bull, too. His nickname is the Bulldog, and like De Niro, he studied the sweet science very closely and trained to look like a professional pugilist. However, out of the ring Crowe's portrayal of James Braddock is more staging than raging. The man is perfect. Doesn't have any bad habits, does all his fighting for his kids and wife, who have the happiest home life ever, even when they are destitute. And this is what makes Cinderella Man a contender that doesn't deserve a shot. In this film it's not the Great Depression, more like the Depression We Can Get Through If We Just Stick Together. The really interesting part of this story would have been if they showed us how this up-and-coming contender suddenly lost everything. We know he made some bad investments, but why didn't he reach out then to his boxing cronies? How did this affect his character? Because when we're thrust back into the story, now in the middle of the Depression, Braddock is just hunky-dory. Sure he's scrounging for shifts at the docks, and he breaks his fighting hand, but not once do we see him or his family break. Even when his son steals a salami, good IL' Dad makes him take it back, but then tells his son he understands that he was scared. Somehow, through a stacked, schmaltzy script, I honestly started wondering what was true about this ""true story."" Which seems to be to be a great disservice to the man, James J. Braddock, who really did accomplish these things. It was the Great Depression, for goodness sake, it's OK to show him really break down or have an argument with his wife. I'd admire him more, because he'd at least be more human. The film also does a great disservice to the Great Depression. Much like in Seabiscuit, another plucky character who spoke for the masses, the Depression is presented only in its appallingly worst and with no real analysis: For example, the stock market crashed, but no one can really tell you why, except for platitudes about greed. But the real reason crashes happen is because governments start insuring investors, who then over-invest (most recently in dot-com start- ups). Off topic I know, but the point is let's stop glorifying this one version of the Depression. I had no idea how great a film Grapes of Wrath was until watching these big-budget, studio films that miss the point: if you're making a film about the worst economic time in U.S. history, maybe you shouldn't be spending so much on extravagant boxing sequences and big-name salaries. Renée Zellwegger, a fine actress always, is not needed in the role of the perfectly supportive wife. Her casting only takes away from the real relationship in the film, that of Braddock and his trainer. Paul Giamatti really zings in this picture and his characterization is neither a grizzled, lovable old man ( Burgess Meredith in Rocky, Clint Eastwood in Baby) nor a shyster. He's somewhere in-between. Very strong work, back where he's best, in a supporting role. Crowe also does good work here, especially in the ring, but also in the unemployment lines. He's one of the best working, I just hope he tries picking more nuanced roles like his work in L.A. Confidential, and stops Oscar-baiting."
"r2good","8","1","3","10 June 2005"," An ""almost-accurate"" account of a real-life event
","This movie was truly inspirational and entertaining, HOWEVER, a few days after viewing it, I read not one, but two articles in The Kansas City Star, in which Max Baer, Jr. (Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" fame) criticized the director, Ron Howard, for portraying Max Baer, his father, to be a monster. In real life, Max Baer had nightmares about the boxer who died as a result of injuries sustained in one of his fights. He even gave up boxing for a time. When he returned to the ring, he lost four of his next six fights because he was so overcome with grief. What Mr. Howard didn't bring to light was the fact that Max Baer was so remorseful over his opponent's death that he paid for the college education of each of that fighter's sons. While Max Baer WAS a wise-cracking person, he took no joy in being responsible for the death of an opponent. I believe that that fact should have been brought out. Indeed! It was a stimulating, RAH-RAH movie, but Max Baer Jr. has a legitimate complaint. While I enjoyed the movie, seeing Jethro's comments in print dimmed the luster of a great performance by Russell Crowe. No disrespect to Russell, but I believe that Ron Howard could and should have been a bit more objective in his portrayal of Max Baer. That's why my rating dropped it from a 9 to an 8."

The entire film plays the entire spectrum of human emotions masterfully -- It tugs at your heartstrings. Now, this is not to say that this is a dull movie; all the action sequences (i.e. boxing) are very, very well done and leave you holding your breath time after time. All in all, Cinderella Man is an excellently delivered masterpiece.<br/><br/>P.S. I registered with IMDb -just- so I could give this a 10."
"fleance-1","10","1","3","30 May 2005"," A Truly Remarkable Film
","I just saw Cinderella Man last night, 5/29/05. I was one of the first crowds in Madison WI to see it. And let me tell you it was amazing. If this is what happens when Ron Howard and Russell Crowe work together, they should line up a few more movies. They already struck gold in ""A Beautiful Mind"", and now ""Cinderella Man"".<br/><br/>The Story follows a Great Depression era Boxer (James J. Braddock) who lost it all when the stock market crashed. He ran into bad luck when he broke his hand and could not even continue boxing well, so the Boxing commission repealed his boxing license. And he could not really take care of his family. But then a year later his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) said he could get Braddock one more fight, against a Heavy-Weight champion. Braddock actually won the fight, and then became America's favorite new under-dog, winning all kinds of challenging fights. He finally got the chance to fight Max Baer, a champ who had killed two people in the ring. Braddock's wife (Renée Zellweger) begged him not to take the fight, for fear of her husband's safety. But he still goes, and fights his heart out. He beats Max Baer, and he has been called the ""Cinderella Man"" for that, and his other fights.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, Renée Zellweger, and Paul Gimatti all deliver Oscar-worthy performances. Crowe as a the kind hearted under-dog boxer, Zellweger as his loving and caring wife, and Giamatti as his confident and inspiring manager. If you like a good film, with romance, drama, action, a happy ending, and a heart, then you should definitely see ""Cinderella Man"", it may just be the best movie of the year."
"MichaelMargetis","7","2","10","7 June 2005"," ""Now I know what I'm fighting for."" - Jim Braddock
","I hate Russell Crowe. It's a fact, pure and simple, I just don't like anything about Russell Crowe. I love Ron Howard, and I think he is a marvelous filmmaker who is terribly underrated, but I just do not like Russell Crowe. So, you could imagine I was very skeptical about this film. Every time the previews would show for 'Cinderella Man', whether it be on television or in the movie theaters, I would cringe and sigh. It had nothing to do with Ron Howard, Renee Zellwegger or the brilliant Paul Giamatti, and it wasn't so much I thought the film had a bad premise. It's just like I said, I DON'T CARE FOR RUSSELL CROWE. That's not to say however, he's a bad actor. Crowe is a great actor, but he's just a bad, crude, annoying and disgusting human being. I don't like watching Crowe too much, but I still think he's a very good actor. Going into 'Cinderella Man' I was not expecting of a good film. Well, by some odd chance 'Cinderella Man' turned out to be actually a good film (not a great one), but a good one. It's entertaining and it really gets you into the mindset of boxing. Of course it's unbelievable, but it's just so damn fun to watch. Do I think it should be noticed during Oscar season? No. Would I watch it again? Probably, I might even pick it up on DVD if it's on sale.<br/><br/>'Cinderella Man' is Ron Howard's boxing biopic on legend Jim Braddock(Crowe, of course). Jim was a heavyweight boxer during the Depression Era in New Jersey. Braddock lived like a king in the late 20s, but by the early 30s (right around the time of the Great Depression) Braddock was living in an almost closet-sized dirty home, because everyone had run out of money, and he and his family (his wife Mae (Zellwegger) and three kids) were struggling to get by. The film portrays Jim as an almost saint (although I'm extremely skeptical on how true that is). He is the perfect husband, loving, compassionate, honest and humble. Jim works when he can lifting crates at the docks, and boxing whenever he can. When Jim gets his boxing license revoked, he doesn't know what to do. He was struggling just to get by with the bucks he was getting from boxing. Jim begs to get a break, and eventually his promoter, Joe Gould (Giamatti) gets him a final fight at Madison Square Garden. Now, Braddock has the ultimate inspiration, he's fighting for food or 'milk' for his family so they can survive. May god have mercy on anyone who gets in the ring with Braddock. After Braddock is making bucks fighting, he eventually has to face off the legendary Max Baer (Craig Bierko), whose already murdered two men in the ring. Braddock's wife is scared for him to fight Baer, but in Braddock's heart he knows he has to, to support his family. 'Cinderella Man' is the title of the film because it was Braddock's nickname. They called him that because he he was an older tired boxer who started winning all of a sudden, they said he was like something out of a fairy tale (hence, 'Cinderella Man'.) The movie also stars Bruce McGill (D-Day from Animal House!) as Jimmy Johnston and Paddy Considine (In America) as Mike, Jim's best friend.<br/><br/>'Cinderella Man' posses many good qualities. Ron Howard provides excellent direction and really nails the authenticity of the time period. The acting is very good for the most part, Russell Crowe gives a surprisingly great performance as Jim Braddock. It's one of the better roles I've seen Crowe in. Paul Giamatti (who was recently undeservedly ignored by the Academy last year for his incendiary work in 'Sideways'), is amazing and funny as usual as Braddock's promoter and semi-friend. Bierko is wonderful and frightening as Max Baer, and although Renee Zellwegger was good she is pretty annoying in this role. My biggest complaint about 'Cinderella Man' is it's screenplay. It's not that Academy Award winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman does a crappy job, it's just that he does a sappy job. 'Cinderella Man' unfortunately follows that all-to-familiar boxing movie formula (which only recently 'Million Dollar Baby' broke, and before that in 1980 'Raging Bull' broke it). You know exactly what is going to happen and when it's going to happen, even if you aren't familiar with Braddock's boxing history (I wasn't). The film doesn't throw any curve balls and it doesn't break the tired boxing movie formula for a second. It's an entertaining and easy to like flick, but don't let the film seduce you into thinking it's an Oscar contender. Although I liked the film, it's unoriginal and it's been done before, over and over and over again. Like I said earlier, it portrays Braddock like a saint, which I'm sure he's not. They make Braddock perfect so no matter what you'll cheer for him, when they could have created him with significant faults and still have you cheering for him, like 'Raging Bull'. But that would take one hell of a great screenplay (again, like 'Raging Bull'), and 'Cinderella Man' sadly doesn't have one. They also portray opposing boxer Max Baer as a villain on par with Hitler almost, but I'm sure Baer wasn't as nasty and cold-hearted (maybe). A lot of people kind of bought the whole Braddock being a great human being thing, but I didn't. I mean how could you be such an extraordinary, compassionate and perfect person and beat the crap out of people for a living. But, that's just me going off on a tangent, so I'll just stop talking about that. On another note, fans of the Rocky series will surly love and appreciate it's extraordinary fight sequences with beautiful cinematography and eye-popping direction from the immensely talented Ron Howard. The movie also achieves some heartfelt moments that will move you emotionally. I recommend it. Grade: B"

","Not being a fan of boxing I usually avoid movies about the sport unless there is some other reason for watching (as in Million Dollar Baby, the initial Rocky film): the idea of watching two people beat each other bloody while crazy crowds cheer just doesn't register as entertainment (the American gladiator syndrome). And while Cinderella MAN is clearly about the game of boxing, the true story of a real boxer, and contains long spans of beatings, this film is not so much about boxing as it is about the indomitable human spirit. It is also one of the finest films depicting the Great Depression in the 1930s that is a timely moment for us all to remember...<br/><br/>In 1928 Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) was a top contender for boxing fame, supporting his wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) and three children, wisely investing his earnings form his winning fights in the reliable stock market, devoting his time to his family and securing their future. Then 1929 happened and the stock market crash destroyed his savings and damaged his ability to fight, plunging him into the mass of poverty accompanied by nearly all Americans. Jim and Mae struggle to feed and clothe their children, and Jim is unable to win at boxing, becomes a 'loser', loses his license, and survives by daily showing up at the docks for the negligible chance of work. The times are bleak, and there is a moment when Mae shifts the children around to family members because they have no food or heat. But Jim's fight manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), himself surviving the bad times under a hollow facade, manages to gain Jim a fight. Despite his advancing age, broken hands, fallen reputation, and challenged ego, Jim manages to sustain his spirit and fights for the survival of his family. The rest is history.<br/><br/>Ron Howard directs this story of a man's indomitable spirit with a fine sense of pacing and manages to hold this two and a half hour movie together without a moment of wasted time. With cinematographer Salvatore Totino and musical score writer Thomas Newman he manages to recreate the gray brown mood of the Great Depression better than any film to date. There are small supporting roles that truly shine: the grossly underused Paddy Considine, Craig Bierko, and Bruce McGill among them are beautifully carved creations. Russell Crowe gives his most understated, credible role and truly inhabits 'Cinderella Man' (his moniker) as a desperately needed hero of the people of the Depression Era. Renée Zellweger once again plays, well...Renée Zellweger. The surprising acting comes from the solid support by Paul Giamatti. If he isn't nominated for best supporting actor then people aren't watching! Cinderella MAN is a strong film, one that sweeps you up and carries you along - even if you don't care about boxing!

","I went to see Cinderella Man with great anticipation, but found that the movie was very well acted, but dragged on and on in many spots. The fight scenes were excellent and I would have sworn that the fight scenes were real, but that was the only exciting part of the film. I realize that you have to tell the story of the hardships that Jim Braddock and his family suffered, but I think this was overdone. I thought the part played by Renee Zelweger was one that could have been played by anyone and was a waste of talent. Paul Giamatti did an excellent job in his part as Braddock's manager. I would recommend this movie to anyone to see, but be prepared to have it drag out in spots. The only thing that saved this movie was the fight scenes. Go see it you will enjoy overall."

(Dir: Ron Howard) <br/><br/>He's the ""Cinderella"" Boy! Crowe/Zellweger/Giamatti & Howard score a k.o.; one of the year's best films.<br/><br/>The underdog's story, particularly a sport underdog's story, has been an old Hollywood chestnut including ""Rocky"", ""Hoosiers"", and ""Seabiscuit"" to name three  which center on perceived losers (or losing situations) to stand up to all odds and remarkably comeback out of nowhere to win the fight, the game or the race. Add ""Cinderella Man"" the latest underdog to make a comeback in cinematic history and a sure shot at next year's Oscar race.<br/><br/>Based on the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction account of heavyweight champion boxer James J. Braddock (played with stoic restraint and dignity by Crowe in another nod for Best Actor)  ""The Bulldog of Bergen"" (that's North Bergen, NJ)- of the 1920s whose perfect world as a fine boxer and a dedicated family man comes to a crushing halt when The Great Depression hits leaving him with practically nothing. The ultimate survival tale begins as Braddock makes every attempt to keep his family together with the help of his kind, loving wife Mae (Zellweger in an equally low-key yet affective turn) who promise not to let their three young children get sent away with other family (a sure sign of failure; not even providing for your family would be considered a sin) no matter what happens. <br/><br/>With bills stacking and dock work slim Braddock finally caves into apply for welfare and eventually back to his manager Joe Gould (Giamatti in a wonderfully plucky supporting role) where, hat in hand, asks for a handout to the big-wigs in the fighting game who ruled Braddock out of his boxing license years earlier when a match went badly (Braddock broke his right hand  his main weapon of defense strategy  with a green opponent that many thought he was pulling his punches for a lame event). Gould eventually is able to secure his friend an undercard match earmarked as his goodbye to the public. What then happens begins his fateful journey from bum palooka to Cinderella Man. <br/><br/>Braddock wins the bout with unlikely luck and skill (many figuring he'd be knocked out since he hadn't fought in 18 months but his use of his left hand on the docks only strengthened him) and appears to be the real deal for a comeback. Gould gets his boy in serious training and the family gets back on track to better days to come. All leading to the historical fight with the world champ Max Baer (played with gusto and menace by Bierko), who infamously killed two of his opponents in the ring.<br/><br/>With insurmountable odds and an easy metaphor for redemption and The American Dream being alive amidst its worst hour, Braddock wins his right to be proclaimed one of America's most heroic athletic comebacks in its fairy-tale like juxtaposition and outcome as a champion prizefighter once again.<br/><br/>Excellent production design by Wynn Thomas, period detailed costuming by Daniel Orlandi, sepia toned cinematography by Salvatore Totino and kinetic editing by Daniel P. Hanley and Mike Hill make every punch thrown deliver with neck-snapping deftness.<br/><br/>Howard continues to be a consummate filmmaker by imbuing his actors with the right amount of letting them work their magic and manipulating their crafts to suit the needs of the storyline. While it would've been another story in another director's hands, Howard lets his actors flesh out their characters with nuance and humanity (and humility) with equal parts heartbreaking humiliation and heart-in-the-throat old school Hollywood thematics  family bonding, requiem for a heavyweight and Capraesque appeal for the common man. As a trivia note, I live near the park that was named after the boxer in New Jersey's hometown of North Bergen and couldn't be prouder to have one of Jersey's own depicted with class, distinction and universal appeal. One of the year's best films."
"sarahgee76","5","2","13","6 June 2005"," Way over-rated mediocrity
","So now that the bandwagon appears to be full, let me jump off of it.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with mixed feelings, but the understanding that I needed to experience it before reading any more reviews. I love Ron Howard and he will forever be a hero of mine simply because of his involvement in Arrested Development, the best television show of the last several years. I've had my problems with some of his movies, however, particularly A Beautiful Mind with its drastically skewed version of the reality of John Nash. As for this one, although the true story of Braddock is very compelling, the film ends up drowning in its own predictability. We know what's coming around every corner and which characters are doomed to the opposite fate of our hero. We know our guy will come out on top, despite the misgivings of his long-suffering wife Mae (even if she doesn't bother voicing them until the climax). All the lead characters are saintly to the point of nausea and, again excepting sadly misguided Mae, never make any actual mistakes. Nothing that goes wrong is their fault, but they find a way to rise above it nonetheless and we (literally and audibly) cheer them on for it.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes are nearly impossible to decipher. The editing is so disjointed that we can never tell who is hitting who and why the crowd is cheering.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti is good, but he's back to his usual buddy/ manager/ co-worker role that we now know is far beneath his talents. Renee Zellweger plays the role that she is given, not that there's much to it. She only exists to stay in the basement with the children and remind Braddock when bills are due and so she fades into the background where she was intended to stay. And, to put it bluntly, I'm over Russell Crow as a brooding, reluctant hero.<br/><br/>Overall, there's not much to rave about here. The one or two effective scenes are swallowed up by the cheese that makes up the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>I think I'll change my vote from 6 to 5."

","...it's just not all that great.<br/><br/>No one working on this picture is capable of doing a BAD film. These are all hugely competent professionals. But despite being structurally interesting (the central character's ""point of apparent defeat"" is relatively early in the film, causing one to wonder how on earth things could get WORSE), the picture is really nothing more than a run-of-the-mill ""boxing movie."" Boxing movies are never about boxing, of course; at least, the good ones aren't. They're about ""the triumph of the human spirit,"" blah blah blah. When a boxing movie comes along that really DOES shake up our preconceptions about the genre (I speak, naturally, of ""Raging Bull,"" always and forever the finest film ""about boxing"" ever made), then it's news. The rest of the time, we watch boxing movies so that we can feel at ease with good old American guts and glory.<br/><br/>No matter how bad things get - a Depression, a terrorist attack, an illegal war run by all those nasty Republican WMD's (White Male Ding-a-lings) - we can always take comfort that ONE LITTLE MAN might make a difference. And it's true often enough that we can sleep more easily at night, visions of Russell Crowe's legitimately charming grin dancing in our heads.<br/><br/>The movie is long and I suspect not for ""artistic reasons"" (from a purely cinematic standpoint, one-third could easily be cut - and that's just the cornball lines). And I don't think it's long because long movies are chic award-winners.<br/><br/>I think it's long because Ron Howard and friends are gracious hosts. They don't want to turn us out into the cruel world any sooner than they have to.<br/><br/>It's a nice thought.

You want nice things to happen to them. When bad things happen to them, you feel bad. (Hope that's not a spoiler for anybody.) But why can't Hollywood take all these tremendously talented people (both in front of and behind the camera) and all of its bloody money and throw them at a script we haven't seen before?"

","This was a good sports movie, I'll admit that I really enjoyed it, but I also sadly have to conclude, after seeing it's extremely high rating on IMDb, that it's a bit overrated. It is a good film with some solid acting performances, but it is not as excellent as other sports or boxing films such as Rocky or Raging Bull. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie, but it's honestly a bit too formulaic and cliched to warrant such a high rating. It's a very likable boxing movie, but it is also filled with blatant schmaltz and unabashed sentimentality. I'd say it deserves more like 7.0-7.1 in my opinion than an 8.0."

","Hey guys welcome back to my channel. As usual we're here in the history through film class reviewing yet another movie. Although I only witnessed the second half of the movie, I know that it's basically about an old head dude who wanted to rep New Jersey and hold things down for his wife and kids through the great depression. Well stuff goes down at a dinner and Braddock's wife throws probably champagne at Max, however the wife doesn't want him to fight till later on. Anyways like and David and Goliath boxing movie, it goes all 15 rounds and goes to decision because obviously Hollywood is against knockouts. Braddock wins and life goes on. From the portion of the movie I saw which mainly entailed the fight, I find the cinematography during which was not eye-pleasing. There was a bright flash to signify a camera after each punch which made it seem like they were trying to do that thing which is slows down every punch to emphasize the strength behind two fighters who obviously didn't train more than a light jog. I came to think this was filmed during the time it took place. Although it isn't a big deal, watching two white guys who have the same skin tone, dark shorts and dark hair, gets a little confusing. Despite all my nonsense criticism, I felt that the acting was good. It definitely represented well about what actually happened. I'm no expert, but I bet it would be hard to make a movie depicting every little detail about something that happened 70 years ago, however they did it chief."

","The story of James Braddock (Russell Crowe), a supposedly washed-up boxer who came back to become a champion and an inspiration in the 1930s.<br/><br/>What does Russell Crowe do best?

When you think fighting, you think Crowe.<br/><br/>At the time, this was probably a great film, but it already seems overshadowed by other boxing movies.

","Braddock's remains one of the most inspiring boxing stories ever- and Ron Howard's version of it just may be the finest cinematic treatment of the subject we've had so far. Crowe is outstanding, as are Zellweger and Giamatti; but it's Howard, the director, who deserves praise in the highest. I made a point of seeing this one on the big screen, but it took me a while to get around to commenting on it (in great part because watching it causes in me a welling in the throat and a mistiness in the eyes). Cinderella MAN, despite what some may have taken to be melodramatics, happens to be a genuinely dramatic Real Life Story with few equals. ROCKY? Forget it. Compared to Cinderella MAN, ROCKY (and all its sequels) are tantamount to some of the cornier GODZILLA movies, with Rocco battling one giant monster after another. (Yes, I realize that Stallone was simply taking a page from Real Life when he wrote a script based on Chuck Wepner's fight with Muhammad Ali, but he subsequently turned it all into one big comic book series.) One of the more interesting aspects of Cinderella MAN was the depiction of Max Baer. The fact that Baer DID, in fact, kill a man in the ring made him a fighter to be reckoned with (although the beating began with a rabbit punch- a blow to the back of his opponent's head) and the filmmaker's milk that notoriety for all it's worth. As a screen villain, ""Max Baer"" is akin to the likes of Real Life full contact Middleweight Karate Champion Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace in A FORCE OF ONE: he comes across as a man fully capable of KILLING someone in the ring. In The Real World, Baer was ""The Clown Prince of Boxing,"" and he often smiled or laughed aloud or even TAUNTED his opponents. In his dismantling of Primo Carnera (a former circus strongman who'd ALSO killed a man in the ring), he was at his belligerent best- but it took him longer than one might've imagined to do away with Carnera: he seemed to tire midway through the fight- but the reprieve was short-lived and the hapless Carnera eventually succumbed. Against Braddock, Baer never seemed to be able to get untracked. He often stiff-armed Braddock with his left to try to measure him for a right, but Braddock invariably derailed him by popping him in the mouth with a solid left jab. It's hard to tell from the fight films I've watched, but it LOOKS like Braddock bloodies Baer's mouth with that jab. Baer grinned once or twice when Braddock jabbed him in the mouth, but it quickly became clear that he didn't find it all that funny. He tried desperately to end it in the fifteenth and final round, but the thing that surprised me most was the fact that Braddock stood his ground and traded punches with Baer until the final bell. He had handily outboxed Baer. It remains to this day an inspirational Real Life success story. (And it didn't end with THIS fight: before he put the title on the line against Joe Louis, Braddock had a stipulation put into their contract that, should Louis win (he did), Braddock would get a percentage of his subsequent title defenses. Which he did.)"

","This film was fine but really, I'm pretty sure every other review here has stated the same.<br/><br/>My main beef though is THAT character. The wife/girlfriend/mother in all these sorts of films who when the hero is on the verge of achieving their wildest dreams, starts saying, ""don't do it, it's not worth it!""<br/><br/>In Cinderella man, Renee Zellweger, the wife of hero, tries to make him pull out of the world championship fight on the basis this man once accidentally killed a man in the ring. Does it get much more selfish than that? This woman clearly has no faith in her husband or respect everything he has done in his entire life that has led up to this once in a life time opportunity . This character always seems to plague these sorts of films. It's just absurd a character this selfish could even exist, let alone be loved by the hero. Of course this character always sees the error of their ways but its ridiculous this situation even existed. Why would someone even plant doubt in their mind of their loved one on the eve/day of their biggest ever moment.<br/><br/>Clearly these films all follow the EXACT same formula, something I'm really starting to find grating. Luckily this film raises above it without a wonderfully compelling finale."
"jboothmillard","8","0","2","22 June 2010"," Cinderella Man
","From director Ron Howard (Splash, The Paper, The Da Vinci Code), he and his leading actor from A Beautiful Mind reunited for this second biographical drama, this time involving sport. Set in the time of the American Great Depression, James 'Jim' Braddock (Golden Globe nominated Russell Crowe) is a champion boxer, who won a fight in 1928, but five years later he and his family are hit by the troubles in the stock market, and unable to get another fight. His wife Mae (Renée Zellweger) would prefer if Jim would quit boxing and stick to working on the docks, but he knows that a fight is what he needs to earn real money. Finally, his trainer, coach and manager Joe Gould (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Paul Giamatti) gets Jim a fight, facing the current number two contender, and he manages to knock him out. His extraordinary comeback in the ring becomes an inspiration to all the Americans suffering in the Depression, and his many fights create excitement in North America. Then the big championship match comes along, where Jim, dubbed ""Cinderella Man"", is to face arrogant champion Max Baer (Scary Movie 4's Craig Bierko), ruthless for killing two men in the ring, which obviously makes Mae scared for Jim's life. Of course, Jim ignores everyone with their concerns, and feels he has nothing to lose in this very brutal boxing match, which thank goodness, the judges conclude, with no knockouts, he won. Also starring Bruce McGill as Jimmy Johnston, Paddy Considine as Mike Wilson, Ron Canada as Joe Jeanette, David Huband as Ford Bond, Connor Price as Jay Braddock, Ariel Waller as Rosemarie Braddock and Patrick Louis as Howard Braddock. Crowe is perfect as the beaten down and brought back again boxer, Zellweger tries to be husky with her accent and she is still reasonable, and all the fight sequences are the best of the film, as an alternative to Rocky it really shows the brutality of boxing. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing and Best Makeup, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. Very good!"

"view_and_review","9","0","1","12 March 2007"," Jimmy Braddock: not your average boxer
","Most biopics made are interesting because of either the person, or the event the person was involved in. The actual person and/or the event do not guarantee that a movie about them will be good, of course the movie has to be done well also. Well, Ron Howard has definitely proved himself a capable director, with films such as ""Far and Away"" and ""Beautiful Mind"", so I expected nothing short of excellence from him in this film. Russell Crowe has established himself as a capable actor from such films as ""Gladiator"" and the afore-mentioned ""Beautiful Mind."" Those two made this movie work, and they made me genuinely interested in the story of Jimmy Braddock.<br/><br/>Jimmy Braddock was a boxer that wasn't that great, but boxing was all he knew. Since Jimmy wasn't that flashy or stunning as a fighter he eventually got ran out of boxing. What was so compelling about his story was that he boxed to feed his family. When the depression hit, everyone felt the squeeze. Jimmy did what he could to find work and provide food, so when boxing came calling back to him he answered the call immediately; even though he was just to be a warm up fight for another boxer.<br/><br/>In so many sports stories the athletes are propelled to prove something to someone even if it is to themselves. They may have to overcome an obstacle to achieve their dream, but it usually ends up being more for self satisfaction. Jimmy Braddock, on the other hand, didn't box to prove anything to anyone, he didn't box to become the heavy weight champion of the world or to prove he was the best, he boxed to feed his family. That motivation may seem simple, but it holds a lot of weight. Most people would die for their families, even kill for their families, so to box for one's family is a nominal act in comparison. Its significance lies in the comparison of one man's goal in sports to the goal of so many others in the sports arena."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>The scene is New York, 1930s. The Wall Street Crash has taken a devastating toll on the people of the Big Apple and the great depression is in full swing, with many of the population living below the poverty line. One of those people is former champion fighter James J Braddock (Russell Crowe), his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and their two children. Braddock's career slumped years ago, and now he's getting by with the occasional work at a docking yard and even living off Relief Aid. But he becomes determined to regain his self esteem, get himself in shape and re-train to once again become the people's champion, this time managing to lift the spirits of the nation as well as reclaiming his honour as one of the greatest boxing heroes ever.<br/><br/>There's just too many films released these days, and no matter what sort of great reviews or cult acclaim they get, I just don't get enough time to see them all and am most likely only to be guaranteed to see the big name, box office hits. Cinderella Man was one of those films that just went right over my head when it first came out, and I've only got round to seeing on the off chance now. I'm quite glad I did, though, because although it's not overly memorable or inspiring, it is a very rewarding and absorbing film to sit down and watch. The main star and the director may have been one reason why I never rushed out to see it, as they're the same team behind, IMHO, the slightly over-rated (especially in light of 2001's other Oscar nominated heavy-weight Training Day!) A Beautiful Mind but messrs Crowe and Ron Howard have pulled this film off with considerable aplomb. None of the performances are particularly brilliant, but Crowe, Zellweger and a supporting cast including Paul Giamatti and some recognizable bit part actors manage to keep things moving engagingly enough and then some.<br/><br/>So then we are left with a film that didn't make a huge impact at the box office and was shadowed over by some (even with it's Oscar nominations) but is beyond watchable nonetheless. The story of the under dog rising to the top through boxing has been done before in films like Rocky and it doesn't do anything particularly surprising or exceptional, but it's a believable, well made and fairly well acted tale that is well worth seeing. ****"

Braddock (Crowe) struggles throughout the film in the ring and in his real life. Crowe plays the typical underdog role in this film, but brings the character to life and makes it his own. This is one of the best sport films that I have ever seen because it is a film that is about sport, but incorporates a story outside of the sport. This is what makes it such a great movie.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Ron Howard who uses film techniques that bring it to life. He uses many straight cuts throughout the film and most of the film were shorter shots. He uses the cross-cutting technique very effectively transitioning back and forth between the fights and real life. He maintains great continuity in the film with the patterns of light and shadows throughout the film, also sound provides smooth transitions from shot to shot."

","I really enjoyed this movie. It, like Seabiscuit, showed how sports helped people deal with the depression. Sports are a short break from the hardships of life. The overall story was entertaining. The technical aspect of the movie was also well. The sound was used to create two different feelings. The big band music was played when Jim's life was going well and he had no financial problems. The classical music was used throughout the entire movie. The fight with the most important sound was the fight with Max Baer. When Max decided to fight and stop goofing around, a harsh sound was played. Another harsh sound was played when Max hit Jimmie the first of the two punches that kill men. The editing and cinematography was fantastic! At the last fight with Max Baer, the editing is quick with straight cuts. The angles switch constantly to create chaos. The color of the film also changes when Jimmie remembers the film he saw of Max killing a man in the ring. The view from Jimmie's eyes is a blurry Max who is moving slowly towards him. This shows how scary Max is in the ring. This movie was excellent. The story line was easy and interesting to follow. It depicts the emotions and hardships of those that lived during the Great Depression. The sound created the mood, and the editing and cinematography made the movie great."

"Alfriend","Null","0","1","3 June 2006"," Excellent film with one major flaw
","The story of James and Mae Braddock and their children is both tragic and amazing. It's hard to imagine the character and heart it took for these people to survive. Braddock himself is all the more amazing in that he was literally starving at the onset of his comeback. I have some limited experience as a boxer and simply can't imagine how he accomplished what he did. Boxing is such a physically demanding sport. If you've never trained or boxed you can't imagine how destructive just the training is on the body let alone fighting in the ring. It's amazing that Braddock was never killed or severely injured during that comeback, let alone that he won all those fights.<br/><br/>Performances by the 3 leads are fantastic. Russell Crowe is the master today of inhabiting a role. He and Renee Zelweger truly resurrect Jim and Mae in all their humanity. Paul Giamatti is perfect casting as Jo Gould, Braddock's manager. The Braddock children are also quite wonderful as are Paddy Considine as the fictional Mike Wilson and Linda Kash in a small but well-played scene as Joe Gould's wife Lucille. The always excellent Bruce McGill as promoter Jimmy Johnston turns in another fine role. May and Jim Braddock's real life grand daughter, Rosemarie DeWitt is wonderful as Sara Wilson. Craig Bierko does a great job as Max Baer. It is however, with the role of Baer in the film that I feel is the tragic flaw in the film. <br/><br/>Max Baer is turned into a fictional and terrible villain in an unnecessary ploy to up the anti and drama in Braddock's already true-to-life impossible climb to the championship. <br/><br/>This portrayal of Baer is falsely modeled on Max Baer's own portrayal of a boxer in the great Humphrey Bogart film, ""The Harder They Fall"". This 1956 film, which was Bogart's last, was very loosely based on the career of Primo Carnera a trumped up Champion who was brutally beaten by the actual Max Baer. This film takes place not in the '30's but the 50's and has more to do with the corruption that existed and may still exist in the fight game. Baer's character in the film also is responsible for killing two fighters in the ring. But in the Bogart film he is bragging about the killings. In real life Baer was quite traumatized by these deaths and many people close to him felt he was never the same fighter after that. Baer became more inconsistent in his training and and his seriousness about boxing was never what it had been before. Baer covered up his pain by often playing the clown and was also known for his good-natured attitude. We never saw this in the film. Rather we saw a mean and sadistic person. I think that Ron Howard and Akiva Goldsman missed a great opportunity in making Baer so one dimensional and denying the man's suffering and true nature. It might have added to the drama and would have not taken any more screen time if we saw this conflicted element in Baer. Regardless of how well he trained or how seriously he took fighting Baer still was considered then and now to have the deadliest right hand punch in boxing history. Braddock's story is a miracle enough as it was and didn't need to belittle another great fighter and character of the time. I understand that often in biopics that theatrical license often needs to be taken to move the film and add drama in order to keep the audience entertained. But with a little more creative effort that still would have happened and Max Baer's legacy could have been preserved.<br/><br/>The Baer family deserved as much respect as the Braddock family got. In the DVD Howard, Crowe and co. go into a lot of detail of how hard they worked to be true to the Braddock story and how happy they were that they had the support of Braddock's only living son. Why not do the same for Baer's family. Apparently Max Baer Jr. (Jethro on TV's Beverly Hillbillys) went out of his way during the production to get the filmmakers to consider the reality of Baer's story and was unsuccessful. It is unfortunate. Consider this, if it was your Dad being wrongly portrayed wouldn't you be upset? <br/><br/>Otherwise, this is an excellent film."

Only God knows why at Oscar time the Hate America First left-liberals in the AMPAS looked away from this unsurpassably splendid work of art.<br/><br/>Third, there are only two boxing films that show ring blows as they look and sound - and must feel - like in the flesh: the uplifting 'Cinderella Man' and the depressing 'Raging Bull' - and both films succeed brilliantly at communicating what they set out to do and to tell - only the individual viewer can choose which film best imparts the same lessons about what it means, and about how best to be, human. My father took me once to a boxing night and, though before that night I'd seen boxing on television, up close to it I was sickened by the vicious, unremitting violence of the contests; having seen those fights up close I'm fully aware that 'Cinderella Man' pulls no punches in depicting, in making the viewer feel, the harrowing, punishing violence that two men wallop into one another in the ring. Yet I have to observe that boxing was and is still with us, and thus a subject worthy of 'Cinderella Man's' awesome cinematic treatment of it. With every blow missed in 'Cinderella Man' I ducked, and with every blow that connected I flinched, cringed - and I wept that two men could, and would, pummel each other with such singleminded ferocity. But here, in and out of the Depression ring, that's the point for Jim Braddock, the point the audience cannot mistake: a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do for them that he loves, and a woman's gotta do what woman's gotta do for the man she loves.<br/><br/>I can't sufficiently praise 'Cinderella Man' except to say that it proved to me that Ron Howard can, and did, make a movie like they used to: straight from the shoulder; gutsy; powerful; adult; and with all the grit and grace, sophistication and splendor of films from Hollywood's Golden Age. I feel that Howard and his entire team may have even raised the bar above the Golden Greats and in doing so, their achievement perfectly reflects Braddock's achievement in the ring and in life."
"Syrchek","8","0","1","26 March 2006"," Corny and too politically correct but it's impossible to say that it is below average.
","It's evident that the entire cast tried very hard on virtually every notable part of the film. The story is about an off-written boxer Jim Braddock who's glory days seem to have gone away. It's the time of the early 1930's, a couple of years after the stock exchange market had collapsed. Time of the ""Great Depression"" they say. In the middle of it there's Jim Braddock, trying to support his family with manual work like most men back in those days. He stopped boxing because of a few bad injuries but the circumstances become so unbearable that he is determined to start his old profession again. Just for a fight or two he says. To get 'back in the black'.<br/><br/>The 1930's atmosphere is pretty authentic I just don't know why I find boxing films that occur in the present time more convincing. I guess I just relate to them strongly. Million Dollar Baby had the 'underdog effect' that exceeded this one. In my point of view MDB is a superior film on every aspect that it's possible too compare the two. Both movies have very handy color usage which contribute to the morbid atmosphere. That's a bit more visible in Cinderella man where the gray and brown shades are used through the entire story. <br/><br/>As politically correct as it is, it evolves in a pretty linear tempo. The tension rises when Braddock is notified that he's about to fight a little less politically correct opponent. Now we have a classical 'god vs. evil' tale. My favorite part of the film: When Braddock is watching the copy of what Max Baer (his rival) has done in his previous fight. It amplified the tension and drove the story through a little curve. <br/><br/>A few words on some fundamental aspects of (non-animated) movies. The acting is this movie's trump card. I can hardly believe that Crowe didn't receive an Oscar nom. Giammati's character was not all that. He seemed too usual. Zellweger was OK and pretty decent in playing Braddock's wife. At least a GG nom would have been something to expect for her acting. I wouldn't exactly place this in the top 250 list, probably somewhere in the tail of top 300. Besides I really juggled with a 7 and an 8.<br/><br/>........ 4/5 ........"

","This really is an excellent movie in many respects. Paul Giamatti should have won an Oscar for his supporting role, and the acting, directing, and story were excellent. Just one big quibble, which was the description of Max Baer as a ""killer."" Truth to tell, Baer did kill an opponent in the ring, and he had one of the strongest punches of any fighter. But the film doesn't tell you that he had nightmares for years about the incident, contributed money to the family of the man he killed, and apparently even paid to send his children to college. Given all that, I doubt that he promoted himself as a killer or teased Mrs. Braddock with the risk that she might become a widow!"

","This is the kind of big, populist entertainment that just screams 'Oscar'. The only problem with ""Cinderella Man"" is that it hasn't done the kind of business at the box-office that Oscar seems to demand and has, therefore, been relegated to the sidelines. And yet, of all Ron Howard's films it may be the best thing he's done to date, (he doesn't have much of a pedigree, I admit). OK, ditch all the scenes with the wife, (a game, but monstrously underused Renee Zellweger) and kids and scrap the scenes with an equally underused Paddy Considine, which seem to belong to a different picture entirely and what you are left with is one hell of a great fight picture, magnificently shot (by Salvatore Totino) and edited (by Daniel Henlay and Mike Hill).<br/><br/>Howard may be a shameless charlatan who messes with our emotions but he is a great showman and in the fight scenes he pushes all the right buttons. You may hate yourself in the morning but this is the kind of triumphalist entertainment that could bring an audience to its feet. It's the story of James Braddock, an outsider who became World Heavyweight Champion in 1935 after defeating Max Baer. But Braddock wasn't just an outsider; he was the personification of everything that is decent and good about the human race. Laid low, he goes on Welfare. Back on his feet again, he gives the welfare money back. Any resemblance to a certain man from Nazareth is purely intentional.<br/><br/>Given Howard's penchant for this kind of gross sentimentality it ought not to work at all. But it does, and in spades, largely due to two terrific performances. As Braddock, Russell Crowe has never been better. He is, of course, wonderful in the ring and, no pun intended, he doesn't pull any punches but it is in the potentially mawkish moments away from the ring that he totally transforms the material and makes us believe in Braddock. One of the film's best scenes has him begging, quite literally cap in hand, for handouts from the boxing fraternity. And as his manager the great Paul Giametti gives an Oscar-worthy performance. He is like a cross between Bambi and a pit-bull terrier and his scenes at the ringside are electrifying. So what we have here is about two-thirds of a near-great movie and for that I am willing to forgive Ron Howard just about anything."

","While some may say that this film is more depressing, than anything else, I found it uplifting. It's the struggle of one poor family in the 1930's during the Great Depression, trying to find hope through one man's dreams.<br/><br/>Based on true events, the story of James (Crowe), circles around his family; his wife and three small children, during tough times in American economy. His dream is to be able to box, and while having broken his hand earlier on in the story, and find scarce work, it seems as though his hope for his family's lives and his own, is barely worth holding on to. But, through the help of a friend, and a lot of belief in himself, tragedy turns into fairy tale, and the rest is the making of an amazing film and true story.<br/><br/>Renee Zellwiger was great as usual, and Paul Giamanti was terrific as well, as he always is in character-driven roles such as these. And, although I'm not a Russel Crowe fan, I was very impressed with his work in this film. He was very real, and his accent was amazing for an Australian.<br/><br/>During the whole movie, it sort of reminded me in the tiniest way of 'Far and Away' the early 1990's movie with Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise, and it came as no surprise why, when the credits ran at the end of this picture, that it had been a Ron Howard film, who also did 'Away'.

","I loved the movie - its portrayal of character in the face of adversity is a tale for the ages. My only complaint is its unfair treatment of Max Baer... Contrary to the movie, Baer did not gloat over the death of an opponent in the ring. He actually took care of the man's family and put the man's children through school. Also, to the consternation of Hitler, Baer beat the German boxer, Max Schmeling, while wearing a ""Star of David"" on his trunks. (The Nazis subsequently banned all media of Baer, by the way - Baer was raised Catholic.) Cinderella Man is an excellent movie. But I think Max Baer deserves better treatment.

","Ron Howard's biographical account of the ""comeback"" of James Braddock, a Depression era boxer who briefly found himself poor and out of favor with the boxing commission (and the public) after having reached the zenith of his fame in the 1920s, is a truly inspiring story. Although I am not a boxing fan, and do not generally voluntarily see boxing films (ie. I was forcibly taken to see ""Million Dollar Baby"" by a family member, and still have not seen a ""Rocky"" film or ""Raging Bull.""), I had heard wonderful things about ""Cinderella Man"" and decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt. I am so happy that I did! This film is appealing on so many levels. At its core, it is more about love and family, and the sacrifices couples make for each other and their children than it is about boxing. Even the scenes that take place within the ring pack emotional punch (no pun intended), and are moving.<br/><br/>The match between Max Bauer and James Braddock is particularly well shown, and I found myself enthralled in their monumental struggle, which is shown as being a kind of David and Goliath conflict. As a result, I put aside for a few minutes my social objections to boxing, and found myself cheering for the ""Cinderella Man"". Russell Crowe brings the same Oscar worthy caliber of acting that he did to his role of Maximus in ""Gladiator"" and John Nash in ""A Beautiful Mind"", allowing the audience to identify and sympathize with James Braddock. By the end of the film, one is made to care about the character, and the plight of his family.<br/><br/>It is a pity that this film made only $50 million in box office sales, because it deserved far more, making it perhaps the most underrated film of 2005."

When faced with the prospect of being beaten down, a person left with no other choice will fight back and ""not pull any punches.""

The movie motivated me to read several books/commentaries on boxing in the US during the 20's and 30's. I'm convinced James Braddock was one of the most courageous athletes in boxing or ANY sport. Motivated almost entirely in supporting and providing for his family, Mr. Braddock stands in stark contrast to the current crop with multiple ""world champions"" motivated almost entirely by money and narcissism. Though not a Russell Crowe fan he does an outstanding job in playing a self-deprecating, humble James Braddock. Craig Bierko was superb as Max Baer, although the Baer of this movie bears little resemblance to the ""real life"" Max Baer, that real life man who put through college the children of the fighter he ""killed"" in the ring.

","Directed by Ron Howard and starring Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger, Paul Giamatti, Paddy Constantine and Craig Bierko. <br/><br/>The movie tells the true tale of James Braddock who turns to the boxing ring as a way of earning a living to ensure his family 's survival. Set in Depression-era New York, Howard quickly paints a grim picture of loss in the shape of wealth and separated families . The film resonates as if it were the Director' s personal story and largely on this tenet, it succeeds marvelously. The stunning screenplay of Akiva Goldsman (who scored an Oscar for ""A Beautiful Mind "" ) and Cliff Hollingsworth, chronologically unfolds Braddock' s career, against the Great Depression with the realization of the heart-breaking impact upon not only his family but the working class. <br/><br/>As with movies of this genre, its success depends largely on the credibility of circumstances surrounding the underdog, the actual underdog and the nemesis. The lead up to the big fight with the nemesis features Bierko in a devilish performance, which transcends being a mere cardboard cut out of a character. Crowe continues to astound with his consummate brilliance. Touches of subtlety, machismo, open emotion are all the right reasons why he will receive another Oscar nomination in the lead actor category. The audience never questions the heart of Braddock, and credit must go to Crowe and his Director for that. <br/><br/>Braddock is supported by his trainer (Giammati) and to a more reserved extent his wife (Zellweger). As if the script and directing were not enough, the supporting cast members themselves spar thus constantly improving each other' s game. Giammati is dynamite, brash, able to be both overwhelming motivational and a mouse, when necessary . The chemistry between Zellweger and Crowe hits you squarely in the gut, as we witness the sacrifices they both attempt to make in adjusting to the prevailing socio-economic conditions. She is strong for her kids and her husband, even though she dislikes his profession. However, retains her vulnerability and musings as she comes to realize the importance of Braddock to the working class and how different things could be, in a very mild, yet thoroughly involving subplot with Paddy Constantine. <br/><br/>Although the boxing ring encounters on at least two occasions seemed shoddily shot, the involvement of the audience by using radio coverage vs. ringside views, coupled with the ready buy-in of the characters, easily outweigh this minor transgression. <br/><br/>During and even after viewing this film, I was reminded of the equally terrific, Seabiscuit. On a technical level, Gary Ross' hand was steady in purpose, the script was well written and the supporting cast, turned in stellar performances. On a thematic basis, the destitution and despair of the Depression, the comeback story, the value of friendships/family, and the moral of perseverance against extraneous odds brought about the same range of emotions. <br/><br/>Alternatively titled, ""Cinder-Biscuit"" is Howard's best work to date and one of the year's great films."

","I'm not a fan of boxing as a sport or boxing movies in general. In fact, the only boxing movies I've seen before this one were Rocky and When We Were Kings, both of which had a large ""Cinderella"" factor. Unsurprisingly, I was inclined to see this movie for the same factor. Cinderella Man did not disappoint, and it has appeal beyond the comeback story.<br/><br/>The movie viscerally connects the audience with the desperation of many Depression-era families, mainly by contrasting Braddock's continuing simplicity and decency with the tragedy of the times. Americans have always preferred to believe that that individual effort is the key to success, and that adverse forces blocking one's progress are just a fact of life. Braddock fits squarely into this mold. As the first rumblings of unionization stirred in the '30s, it never occurs to Braddock that the capitalistic system is to blame for Depression. As one co-worker from the docks rails against the ""big guys,"" insisting that workers have to organize, Braddock looks at him skeptically and asks, ""Organize against what -- bad luck? Greed? Drought?"" While other couples send their kids they can no longer support to live with relatives, Braddock is fierce in his insistence on keeping his family together. Even though the family doesn't have enough to eat, Braddock makes his son return a salami that he stole to feed the family, and Braddock applies for public assistance only as a last resort. Crowe has perfected the portrayal of decency through several of his roles (The Insider, Gladiator, and even Master and Commander), and his humility always comes across as sincere and believable.<br/><br/>The other great characterization is that of Joe Gould. Giammati plays him perfectly: motor-mouth charm, a marketer's brashness. He comes across as slightly larger than life, but never descending into caricature. In their interactions, the normally taciturn Braddock reflects Gould's looseness, rendering Braddock much more sympathetic. In fact, in their scenes together, it's Gould, and not Braddock who dominates. Giammati also believably conveys Gould's touches of humanity throughout, especially in relation to his concern for Braddock and his family. When Gould gets excited as Braddock stages his comeback, it's clear that he's truly happy for Braddock as well as for himself.<br/><br/>Boxing matches, of course, form the centerpiece of the movie, and they're quite well done and graphic. If you're squeamish, hold someone's hand as the blows fly, heads snap back from impact, sweat drips, and blood dribbles out of noses and mouths. The images of wife and family that flash through Braddock's mind on screen, though, are heavy-handed reminders of why Braddock is fighting so ferociously.<br/><br/>The only real disappointment is the lack of development of Braddock's wife, Mae. The script simply doesn't give her much to do, and Zellweiger doesn't squeeze out more than the script requires.<br/><br/>Braddock's story is the real-life Rocky, and if you liked the latter, you'll like the former. The Depression was an era when people desperately needed heroes, and Braddock is still worth cheering for today."

Film is such a totally collaborative art form and all of the parts have to come together successfully to create a first-rate movie. That's exactly what happens here and Ron Howard once again shows what an excellent director he is capable of being. Granted, the theme of an underdog boxer attempting to make a great comeback is older than Rocky One but much more multi-dimensional in this case, and for my money this is a much better flick that Million Dollar Baby. The movie not only portrays the hardships and grinding poverty of the Depression era but also powerfully depicts a profoundly decent and ethical man of great courage and integrity putting his life (and pride) on the line for his family. It's hard to imagine any other actor who could pull this off as Russell Crow does here. His performance manages to be understated, subtle and totally convincing in the role of Jimmy Braddock. Renee Zellweger also turns in a fine performance, as do other members of the uniformly excellent cast. Craig Bierko is terrific as the arrogant and murderous fighter, Max Baer, and the scene between fight promoter Jimmy Johnston (Bruce McGill) and Braddock's trainer/manager (Paul Giamatti) is a gem.

"JimD73","8","0","1","18 December 2005"," Cinderella Man has Oscar written all over it
","After Million Dollar Baby made it big last year, it was pretty much a given that another boxing-themed movie would be released this year. Exactly what kind of boxing movie was out in the open. So why not take a theme from another successful movie from a couple years ago, combine it with MDB, and throw in a biopic because those are in now. So we now have a boxing biopic set in the great depression. As much as it may seem like just a combination of some other themes that worked recently, Cinderella Man works extremely well on its own even when compared to everything else like it.<br/><br/>The subject of Cinderella Man is boxer Jimmy Braddock (Crowe), who was working his way to the top undefeated before the Great Depression came and took away everything he had, leaving him and his wife Mae (Zellweger) struggling to make enough money to feed their three children. Braddock is working at the docks, but there is little need for men, so he often does not get shifts. Occasionally he gets an offer for a fight from his longtime manager Joe Gould (Giamatti), but his former reputation no longer exists and he performs abysmally. After one particularly bad fight against a low-level boxer, where he manages to break his hand for a third time, boxing promoter Jimmy Johnston (McGill) strips him of his licence, leaving Braddock with a broken hand and little work at the docks.<br/><br/>After some time, Gould contacts Braddock about having him replace a fighter who dropped out of a match against the #2 title contender, Corn Griffin. Braddock agrees due to the high payout win-or-lose, and ends up beating Griffin in the ring, spurring the resurgence of his boxing career, as well as his wife's fears for his life. These fear are much enlarged when Braddock finds himself in a fight with Max Baer (Bierko), the world champion who has killed two men in the ring.<br/><br/>There is also some sidestories that deal directly with the depression, most notably one involving fellow dock worker Mike Wilson (Considine), though these tend to disappear once Braddock's boxing career starts up again. This is a blessing for the movie, as any more depression stories once it kicks into high gear would ruin the flow, though they are often very moving in the first half.<br/><br/>The plot moves along at a surprisingly quick pace. Most of the time in movies like this, the story tends to linger on some elements for far longer than it should. That never happens here, and while it does run at a solid 2:15, it has enough plot to fill a three hour movie under normal circumstances. This makes Cinderella Man a much more re-watchable movie than others like it.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is definitely there to give you an understanding of Braddock and the times he lives in, but the movie gets really good once the boxing action starts up. The fights are extraordinary after the Griffin match, with perfect direction throughout them all. The slowdowns at times of specific pain for Braddock are well used and only pop up when the scar is going to become a plot piece for later on (such as his broken hand). The rounds go by fairly quickly, but always are long enough to get you involved in every fight. The one involving Art Lasky is particularly good, as is the final bout with Baer. The only problem here is that there are only four notable fights, but any more would make the movie inaccurate, so these four fights are made exceptionally well.<br/><br/>The acting is also incredible on all fronts. Russell Crowe turns in his fourth Oscar worthy performance in a row, after Master & Commander, A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator, this one ranking right up near the top. Renee Zellweger, who is not normally one of my favourite actresses, also brings in a surprisingly powerful performance as the torn wife who knows they need the money but can't stand to see her husband in the ring. Then there is Paul Giamatti, who was unrightfully denied an Oscar nomination for last year's Sideways. While he doesn't have quite as much to work with this time around, he proves himself incredibly worthy and definitely deserves serious consideration. Also worth noting are Bruce McGill as a boxing promoter and Craig Bierko as a deliciously antagonistic rival.<br/><br/>Usually in a review, the critic has something bad to say about the movie. Oddly enough, I cannot think of any criticisms for Cinderella Man. Sure, maybe it could have been a little more, but from what is delivered is flawless, being Ron Howard's best movie in ages and turning in some great performances from Crowe, Zellweger and Giamatti. This movie has Oscar written all over it, and if you call yourself a lover of movies you are obligated to see this one.<br/><br/>Overall Score  96%"

","Cinderella Man is a amazing story that is made into an amazing movie, it is pretty much perfect, everything is great, the acting is amazing, the direction perfect and the screenplay great. I loved pretty much everything about this film is fits real life together very, very well and makes it fit onto the TV screen. The performances are all Oscar worthy and all perfect. Russell Crowe is the best, he is perfectly cast as James J. Bradock, he needs to win an other Oscar, I doubt he will win this year but he really deserves it. Renee Zellweger is about as good and it is easily her best performance. Paul Giamatti is the one I think really may have a chance at the Oscar, it is about time he wins, and he hasn't even been nominated. Stupid academy. The screenplay is great it has amazing dialogue and perfect characters, the scenes are perfectly put together. I loved this film and it may be the best of the year."
"UltimateGamer15","10","0","1","17 December 2005"," Second best boxing movie, ever!
","Falling just behind Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull,"" ""Cinderella Man"" is a magnificent masterpiece accurately depicting the life of Jim Braddock, the story of a man who was on top of the boxing world, fell to the Depression, and was able to build himself up to fight again for his family and his friends. Ron Howard did an extraordinary job of portraying Braddock's life and the Great Depression. Using unique and new camera angles that show not only the boxer's perspective of the fight, but also those of the audience, Howard made the film seem very neat and always kept you watching and wondering what was going to happen next. He also used much of that new amateur-like style of filming with the camera, making the shots unsteady and trembling to build up tension in the audience, almost as if the camera itself is an audience member trying to see the fight and what the opponents are doing when in their corners. And although much of the film's fight scenes are greatly inspired and ""copied"" off of ""Raging Bull,"" Howard was able to make them seem new and different with the incorporation technology and his own filming style.<br/><br/>Russell Crowe, after watching this movie, is one of the few great actors we have left who knows how to choose a good movie and make the character seem real. His portrayal of Jim Braddock is no different. Once in the depression, the audience is supposed to truly feel bad for him as he tries to survive without money and a job. Crowe does this very well and is able to look the part as well, much like he did in ""A Beautiful Mind"" in some scenes. He then further builds on his performance when in the ring, appearing exhausted at times, and strong at others. He also appears much like any other normal man who knows what he has to do and how he has to do it. Paul Giamatti plays Braddock's trainer and manager, Joe Gould, and does a fabulous job doing it. At times he is the ""comic relief,"" being able to take a crappy situation and make it funny. But, he is then able to take that attitude and push it aside as he becomes worried or anxious when Braddock is in the ring, knowing it is his fault if anything happens. Renee Zellweger also does a good job portraying Jim Braddock's wife, Mae. Although not as good as Crowe, she does a wonderful job making the audience feel her pain as she is concerned before and after every fight for Braddock's health. One also feels her pain when she tries to bring up her family in the middle of the Depression with no money and a very small house, relying on her husband to hopefully get some work and bring home some money. One final note on performances, Craig Bierko plays Max Baer, the heavyweight champion Braddock has to face in 1935, and does a good job doing it. He is just the guy you love to hate as you watch the movie and is very creepy and evil like. <br/><br/>All in all, ""Cinderella Man"" is an awesome movie that everyone should see before they die, regardless of if they like boxing or not. It is a film that accurately portrays the life of one of America's greatest men who brought inspiration and hope to those who had nothing."

","The ""Beautiful Mind"" team has done it again. An honest, heartwarming and truly inspiring movie that renews my faith in humanity.<br/><br/>Too bad it did not do well at box office but the DVD is well worth the time to view all the extras. <br/><br/>I especially liked the scenes of people in line for work and soup lines. The attention to detail is so real to me. I lived in Detroit at this time and it was just as hard.<br/><br/>Also the movie does not do a ""Grapes of Wrath"" portrayal of a ""dog eat dog"" society.

"EUyeshima","8","0","1","12 December 2005"," Old-Fashioned Story Strong on Historical Context and the One-Two Punch of Crowe and Giamatti
","As he proved with 1995's ""Apollo 13"", director Ron Howard has an innate capacity of taking a well-known historical event and building suspense around an inevitable outcome. That's because he is adept at developing characters that reach deeper than the facts presented in standard docudramas. This time out, he takes a well-worn leitmotif in movies, the underdog overriding the odds to become a world champion, and puts a plush, sepia-toned design to this Depression-era story about light heavyweight boxer James J. Braddock. The movie is as old-fashioned as Hollywood movies come, but Howard also seems intent on presenting an interesting period of American history that has often been overlooked in recent films.<br/><br/>Starting as a contender in late 1928, he deteriorates into fighting second-rate bouts five years later until he breaks his hand, at which point he is relegated to ad hoc longshoremen jobs on the New Jersey docks. Braddock gets a chance at redemption when his former manager, Joe Gould, offers him $250 to fight a heavyweight contender. He unexpectedly confounds the bookmakers and wins, which eventually leads him to a shot at the title against the heavily-favored opponent, Max Baer. Since the main story structure is rather predictable, Howard, driven by a period-authentic script by Akiva Goldsman and Cliff Hollingsworth, focuses on the atmosphere and the effect of the Depression on families struggling to survive. For example, the details around Madison Square Garden and the ""Hooverville"" in Central Park feel genuine, and when Braddock hits rock bottom and begs for money from his backers, the scene has an unflinching honesty about how his humiliation has been superseded by his need to get his children back from relatives.<br/><br/>It certainly helps to have Russell Crowe portray Braddock in a committed performance that would make Spencer Tracy proud. While it doesn't rank with his subtly complex work in ""The Insider"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"", his heroic performance is top-notch for this type of venture. The film's other sturdy performance comes from Paul Giamatti, who gives Joe a humanistic spirit that provides Braddock his path toward victory. I wish I could say the same for Renée Zellweger, who plays the June Allyson role of Braddock's wife Mae, with squinty-eyed worry and stiff upper-lip devotion, spouting the script's most sentimental lines (""You are the champion of my heart, James J. Braddock!""). It just seems like a sophomoric role for such a proved actress. Smaller roles are filled out expertly, in particular, Paddy Considine as a Communist colleague who wants to force anarchy to make the government respond to the starving masses; Bruce McGill as the mercenary promoter; and Craig Bierko - who seems to be finally graduating from his golden-boy TV-movie roles - as the boastful, menacing Baer (probably an unfair portrait but one that works within this narrative).<br/><br/>It's intriguing that for all the old-fashioned drama developed toward the final bout, that the more penetrating insight in the movie comes from how the period of FDR's New Deal really did not provide a timely response to the people who faced the degradation of poverty and starvation. Braddock is shown as a symbol for the downtrodden which the administration could not fathom in resuscitating hope for people. The DVD contains an insightful audio commentary track with Howard accompanied by screenwriters Goldman and Hollingsworth, as well as deleted scenes and several featurettes about the production. The most interesting addition though is about the subject himself, ""Jim Braddock: The Friends & Family Behind The Legend""."

This movie was so good that I wanted to put eight dollars in an envelope and send it to Ron Howard for not going to see this in theaters. Sure the movie is two and a half hours long but it flows so smoothly that its seems like its over as soon as it starts. it has some of the greatest boxing scenes I've ever seen it blows all the Rocky's and million dollar baby and raging bull out of the water and takes the crown as the greatest boxing movie ever and i would ever argue the greatest sports movie ever but calling it a sports movie is unfair because it is so much more. This movie has it all it will make you laugh make you cry and at the end it will get your blood pumping and adrenaline flowing and you'll be on your feet rooting on Jimmy like it was a real fighting happening right now. The camera work is amazing and the look and feel of the move make you feel like your right there with these people and as cheesy as it may be you root for these people and win they succeed it makes you feel like you have too. This story can still inspire people to this day more than seventies years after it happened. This movie was not done justice at the box office and I'm sorry to say I was part of the problem.

"pc95","7","0","2","6 December 2005"," Decent, but overcooked at times
","In general, Cinderalla Man does pretty well. Its worth a rental, but I probably wouldn't purchase it. The narrative flowed pretty well and didn't drag that much; I took into account that the director and screenwriter were basing the material off a biography for the most part. I didn't like some of the side-story detours though like with his drunk friend who died after trampled - it felt melodramatic. The acting was for the most part good - especially Paul Giamatti, lighting up the boxing scenes and portraying a good friend and coach amiably with some verve. Crowe plays it low key and also does decently although his supposedly Irish accent sounds more Italian and slips at times, but that's minor. He's convincing enough as a Dad, Husband, and fighter. The period sets were also interesting, along with clothes, music, and life in the 30's - seeming plausible and additive to the story. Now, the child actors could've done better though - a little too directed maybe, and I'm not sure Renee Zellweger fits the role unfortunately....her persona felt misplaced. Where does the story feel overcooked? - the final 30 min or so, should have been edited and I didn't much care for the clichéd crowds/audiences in churches, bars, ring-sides etc demonstrating how we the audience should feel, or the contextual overuse of prayer granted they're Irish. The music/score sometimes felt cued and noticeably distracting. But despite the annoyances I found Cinderella Man to be entertaining and and with sporadic strong scenes."
"rockgeek56","10","0","1","30 November 2005"," As of late November, the Best Picture of the Year
","Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger & Paul Giamatti all give Oscar caliber performances in this film based on the true story of Jim Braddock. Crowe's performance is his best since ""The Insider"". Zellweger's Mae is loving and warm and the chemistry between she and Crowe is palpable on screen. Giamatti should get (& hopefully receive) a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Braddock's agent, who bends over backwards to help his fighter support his family through the Depression. I did find some of the boxing scenes to be a bit brutal, but I think it was because I quickly became emotionally invested in all the characters in this film. Other than that, this is a beautifully filmed, wonderfully directed, honest and heart-wrenching movie that has Best Film written all over it!"

I could be wrong though. The movie had a good story and was well shot. I expected more but from what I received I was satisfied with all the actors performances. Russell Crowe is one of the better actors out there and I still say Renee Zelwegger just has a really good agent. She is a good actor and she does the same things in all movies but I can't really find anything in her that separates her from the rest. She does sale her roles though and thats what you look for.

The rest of the cast were also fantastic, especially Zellweger. She gave a great performance. Paul Giamatti was a great surprise, my faith has been restored. I was not expecting to see him in this movie, and then, when I did, I wasn't expecting much. However this was an opportunity for me to see his capabilities as an actor, excellent is all I can say.

If you want to see a good one, try ""The Boxer"" instead. Finally, it's a very average performance of actors, but, luckily, Paul Giamatti saves the day.

","I find it mildly depressing that people will pay good money to watch two beefy guys trying to knock each other down in a boxing ring, but the spectators at a boxing match obviously derive a lot of atavistic pleasure from it. Inasmuch as it sublimates their desire to punch each other I suppose boxing serves a useful social purpose. You certainly can't blame a working-class stiff from New Jersey like Jim Braddock from using his fast right fist and high tolerance for punishment as a way out of grinding poverty for his family, and he was an inspiring figure for many in the 1930s. This is not a person trying to find themselves through fisticuffs like Hilary Swank's tragic character in ""Million Dollar Baby"".<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" (a title bestowed on Braddock by legendary journalist Damon Runyon) is a superior Hollywood biopic from journeyman director Ron Howard who previously directed Russell Crowe in ""A Beautiful Mind"", a biopic about a more cerebral man, the brilliant and troubled Nobel prize-winning mathematician John Nash. Hence there is plenty of schmaltz and contrived emotion, almost to Spielbergian proportions, but there are also good production values and thus we get a fine recreation of the look and feel of the depression years in the urban US. There is also some fine acting.<br/><br/>Russell plays Braddock as a fairly quiet, very stoic and steely determined man who sticks to his values throughout. An old-fashioned hero, in fact, with moments of desperation but not much self-doubt (and not much time for it either). He is an exemplary husband and father. It's a pretty low-key performance but well-judged. When he's not throwing telephones at hapless hotel desk clerks Russell can do a good job. Paul Giamatti as Joe the agent gives us a well-rounded character rather than a caricature and Renee Zellweger ably supports Russ as Mae Braddock.<br/><br/>As this is a biopic, it can be revealed that Braddock eventually prevails and was world champion until defeated by Joe Louis two years later. In his championship fight against Max Baer (turned into a bad guy for the purposes of the movie via a wonderful bit of hamming by Craig Bierko), Braddock won by lasting the distance (all 15 rounds) just a bit better than Baer. There is a lot of actual boxing in what is quite a long film and we get to see about half the title fight. For me, the boxing scenes could have been shorter but as we know, people pay to see this sort of thing and Howard is not about to disappoint the crowd. The suspense is terrific, even if you know the result.<br/><br/>But the last word has to be with Paul Simon:<br/><br/>In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade And he carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down or cut him 'til he cried out in his anger and his shame I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains"
"JoshRyalsIsOnWelfare","10","0","1","12 October 2005"," An Incredible Motion Picture....
","I've always thought that the greatest sports films focused less on the actual sports and more on the various plights of the principals. Obviously, Ron Howard agrees with this sentiment. He has presented extraordinarily choreographed fight sequences(probably the most realistic fight scenes put to screen!) but with the bulk of ""Cinderella Man""'s screen time, we are given a foray into the hardships of James J. Braddock and his family. We are also given a view of the starkly contrasting lifestyles of those that were able to escape the ""Great Depression""'s poverty; men like boxing champion Max Baer and New York boxing promoter Jim Johnston. The two worlds those characters embody collide in a climactic ending duel for the heavyweight championship of the world. Considering his three prior hand fractures and rib injuries incurred during a car accident AND the fact that his opponent Max Baer literally killed two of his previous opponents, James J. Braddock may have been the greatest underdog in organized sports. This film tells his story and it tells it well. Thomas Newman contributes yet another incredible score."

","When we look back at yesterday's movies, like Rocky, Ali and the most recent being the Oscar winner Million Dollar Baby, we look at how these movies and more others are an inspiration to other directors and writers. After watching Cinderella Man, i was so impressed with Ron Howard's direction, that i felt it more powerful than A Beautiful Mind. The Story is set around a small time boxer named James J. Braddock and the 1929 Great Depression. His family, Mae and the three children, try to fight the atrocities of the depression and its effects. As heard in the Behind the Scenes, Poverty is mainly the antagonist in the movie. The Characters are very powerful, going from Rusell Crowe as a fighting and surviving boxer to Renee Zellweger as a courageous mother and wife, with supporting cast from Paul Giamatti, and other caricature characters that come along the way throughout the movie. Russell Crowe once again delivers a Knockout after Gladiator and Master and Commander, Renee Zellweger does her 30's actress type makeup and expressions beautifully, Paul Giamatti as Russell Crowe's trainer does a fantastic supporting job as his friend in the ring. The rest of the Cast is great to look at, especially the boxer Max who is out to destroy anyone he meets is also deadly. The screenplay is great, i loved the way each and every aspect was described. Taking the film on the Cutting Room floor must have been difficult for director Howard, because it looks that there is not one shot he left out. The Cinematography looked beautiful, something from other inspirational movies such as Million Dollar Baby or Seabiscuit. The Costumes and Artistic 1930's sets were superbly done, even when filming in confined spaces. The Sound was so perfect that you would not forget the visuals you have seen and the sounds heard. The music was something to cry about that makes you feel special to hear. The last fight also has such an incredible build-up that it makes you intensely want to stay till the end. Even when the villain is introduced he is given the smallest build up to be a villain. This is a movie that has many inspirations inside, from Ron Howard's previous films such as Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. I would any day prefer to go for this movie. Many People who came out of the theater said that this will be the Oscar Contender for this year. I give this movie a straight 10 out of 10. Go watch it, it is the best movie of the year."

","Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" should rank among the best films for this year's awards. This movie, in addition to being entertaining and engrossing, is truly a work of art! Howard's directorial skills continue to improve with each and every effort. And, even though there are graphically-violent scenes in the boxing ring, this is a family film which can be appreciated by the young and old alike. My wife and I agree that ""Cinderella Man"" is among the best motion pictures we've seen over the past several years. Everything in the film... the camera work, and its unique angles... the sepia tone which emphasizes the period it represents; that of the national depression of the 1930s... the music... and the positive messages conveyed throughout the story... GREAT JOB, RON HOWARD!"
"Buddy-51","7","0","1","9 July 2005"," solid Depression Era drama
","Although the comparisons may not be entirely obvious at first, could it be that Ron Howard's ""Cinderella Man"" is actually a sly, under-the-radar remake of ""Seabiscuit"" - albeit with a boxer rather than a racehorse as its inspirational underdog character? In a performance of immense restraint and subtlety, Russell Crowe plays James J Braddock, a Depression era fighter who, at one point, was so hard up that he could barely afford to feed his wife and three small children. For awhile it seemed as if Braddock was all washed up as a boxer, a has-been whose body seemed incapable of taking any further punishment and whose glory days all lay behind him. However, when his luck turned and he began to make a comeback in the ring, knocking off one sure-bet opponent after another, Braddock caught the imagination of a suffering nation, becoming in many ways a symbol of hope and renewal for the beleaguered, downtrodden, out-of-work masses who flocked to his bouts or listened to them enraptured on the radio at home. It was for this reason that he was dubbed Cinderella Man by an astute and appreciative newspaper columnist.<br/><br/>Let us say, first of all, that Braddock was no Jake La Motta, either in the ring or out. From what we see of him in the film, Braddock was a kind, gentle man who loved his wife and tried to be the best father he could to his adoring children. It is always more difficult to weave an interesting drama around a ""good"" character than a ""bad"" one, and Howard's film can't always overcome that limitation. Frequently the film feels a mite softer and less hard-edged than we would like it to be, more ""Rocky"" than ""Raging Bull."" Still, I guess the makers of the film were simply trying to remain true to their subject and for that they are to be commended. The scenes between Crowe and Renee Zellweger as Mae, Braddock's concerned but supportive wife, serve as the fulcrum that keeps the story balanced and interesting. Ditto for the relationship between Braddock and Joe Gould, his devoted manager, beautifully played by Paul Giamatti. We also see Braddock instilling a strong sense of moral values into his children despite the harsh conditions under which they live. For ""Cinderella Man"" effectively conveys just how difficult life was for many ordinary Americans in the 1930's, just how close to starvation many of them came in their daily struggle with poverty. Braddock's tale is emblematic of life in that difficult era.<br/><br/>Howard generates a tremendous amount of suspense in his closing scenes in which Braddock challenges the world's reigning champ, Max Baer, in a bout in Madison Square Garden Garden. Howard brilliantly intercuts between the boxers, the fans and Mae, who is listening to the fight on the radio at home, terrified that her beloved husband may not survive the bout.<br/><br/>Thus, despite the occasionally lackluster storytelling and overindulgence in sentimentality, ""Cinderella Man"" scores as a moving tribute to a decent man who never gave up."
"rosscinema","7","0","2","26 June 2005"," Braddock's underdog story receives good treatment by Howard
","Studios have made more than their share of films dealing with the sport of boxing with arguably the best being ""Fat City"", ""Rocky"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""The Set-Up"", and ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" and they each bring their own special twist to the genre but while I'm not convinced that this film is as good as those it's still an incredibly well made effort that deserves to be mentioned along side them. This is the true story of the Depression era boxer Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) who struggled like millions of others to put food on the table for his family and tries to make money by working shifts at the docks in Hoboken, New Jersey. Braddock started his boxing career pretty well but once the crash hit he and his family were reduced to living in squalor with no heat and very little to eat.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Braddock is also unable to get a fight after breaking his right hand numerous times and even has his license revoked by the commission after sub-par efforts. Braddock is supported greatly by his devoted wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) who would do anything for her husband except watch or listen to one of his fights. One day out of the blue his manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) gets him a big fight at the Garden with a ranked contender and surprises everyone by winning it! This leads to more important bouts with good fighters which he also wins and it leads to a title shot with the champ Max Baer (Craig Bierko) who is responsible for the deaths of two of his opponents.<br/><br/>Director Ron Howard is technically as good as any filmmaker working today but his vulnerability is that his films can cross the line into sappiness and become emotionally obvious but here I think it works to his (and our) advantage because he taps into the brave and honest struggles of a working class hero. Braddock wasn't exactly a complicated man but his career as a boxer went up and down and up again with everything that takes place in the middle helping to show audiences what he was made of in terms of being a man and a father. Crowe in real life can be a rugged character but one of his best virtues as an actor is that he can show tremendous passion and tenderness in his performances and this quality has always reminded me of Burt Lancaster who was extremely manly and thoughtful at the same time. Being a boxing fan myself my main complaint in the story is the portrayal of Max Baer who is shown as a real brute but in real life he was really nothing like that but my guess is that Howard really wanted audiences to have a strong reason to root for Braddock's success not just in terms of earning money but to try and not get killed! Giamatti can credit his performance to the great boxing trainer Angelo Dundee (who appears in the film) and his speeches during the film are designed to inspire Braddock and help make him rise above the odds and he's believable in the role as he shows both tenacity for his profession and the personal sacrifices he makes to help his boxer and friend. Many have said that this is Howard's best film to date but I think that's completely false when you think of previous efforts like ""Apollo 13"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" but make no bones about it, this is a well made and acted film that does the correct thing by just being (for the most part) honest in it's portrayal."
"dbborroughs","7","0","2","21 June 2005"," Painfully slow first hour weakens a very good Depression era drama
","This is the story of Jim Braddock a ""washed up"" fighter and one time championship contender who manages to turn a fluke chance into something more. Its a rousing story about a man who although appears to have hit bottom manages to pull himself up again for the sake of his family.<br/><br/>Word has this as an early contender for numerous Oscars, unfortunately audiences have yet to find this film, which as of this writing is disappearing from theaters. Having seen the film I can understand why people are staying away from this screenings, its badly paced and at two and a half hours it seems twice that.(This will play better on cable and DVD) This isn't to say that its a bad film, its not, its just that the film takes about an hour before it shows any real signs of life. Its not the fault of the actors, who are pretty much excellent across the board. You can't really blame the director, Ron Howard, either since this is a beautifully made film. The fight scenes are simply some of the best ever put on the screen. The fault is squarely on the script which takes forever to get where its going. Its a solid hour of how bad life is in the Depression and how hard it is for Braddock to support his family. It just seems to go on and on and on. Later in the film the seems to repeat the same notes again and again as if to show how far Braddock has risen. I got the point early and didn't need to be reminded over and over. I 'm of the opinion that you could probably remove thirty minutes out of this with out losing anything.<br/><br/>I must say that this is a very good film once it gets moving and absolutely worth seeing, though its probably going to play better sitting on your couch where you can stretch out during the opening slow bits.<br/><br/>Seven out of ten.(really seven and a half)"
"dougtreasa","10","0","1","17 June 2005"," Predictable but still very compelling.
","This movie has been labeled ""predictable"" by many critics but it is based on a true story and is quite accurate according to stories I've read about the main character's life. But its predictability does not ruin the compelling story being told. This movie is a great ""date movie"" as my wife truly enjoyed it despite hating boxing. It is also a great ""guy movie"" because the boxing scenes were very realistic as well as the work ethic displayed by those who were enduring the depression. I believe this movie is being significantly underrated! It may be due to the recent negative publicity received by the star of this film. But do not let this deter you from seeing a great movie. If you're an American who is proud of your country and its history then you will not be disappointed!"
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","3","10 June 2005"," Exemplary mediocrity ain't such a bad thing
","I have considered myself an opponent of Ron Howard's approach to film-making ever since I saw ""A Beautiful Mind"" and found it manipulative, fake, and driven by false romantic assumptions about genius and madness. Worse yet, there was the sheer skill and conviction, the demonstrated ability to make millions lap up what Howard dealt out and call it a great movie. Nonetheless I thought this might be a better one and it is -- at least in the sense of being a well made conventional boxing picture -- though I don't see quite why we need another one so soon after ""Million Dollar Baby: -- and in the sense of having engaged my attention and, occasionally, my emotions, without leaving me seething with rage. I may have to modify my anti-Howard position after this new movie.<br/><br/>""Cinderella Man"" was a phrase used by contemporary journalists to label the triumphal concluding phase of James Braddock's seven-year period of boxing failure, Depression hard times, and sudden rise to heavyweight champion. The conventional underdog success story Ron Howard has made of Braddock's rise-from-the-ashes saga is as well done a little epic of feel-good courage as anybody could make at this questionable time in American history. Not surprisingly, the cast had to be headed up by a New Zealander.<br/><br/>The movie's steeped in period flavor which only rarely feels fake: there's a bit too much artificial snow and the period cars as usual are too shiny and perfect, but the clothes are good and the people look right. Russell Crowe himself has a face that fits very well into the sallow, downtrodden look of the Depression. I love the fleshy Irish boxing commissioner: I didn't know faces of such wonderfully glossy period smugness still existed on living actors' bodies: he's like a big, fleshier, venial FDR. Russell Crowe as Braddock and Paul Giamatti as his trainer (the character being an amalgam of the actual manager and trainer) are impeccable. Or not very peccable. Giamatti is odd, thinner-voiced and more delicate than you'd expect a denizen of the ring to be, but that in itself makes one inclined to think him more like the real thing than any usual movie version. And one just wants Giamatti, after his meteoric rise through playing losers in ""American Splendor"" and ""Sideways,"" to show us he can act a role that's neither whiney nor weird. Renée Zellweger, whom Hollywood too much loves to see as the plucky little lady, delivers the movie's most nauseatingly saccharine lines as Mrs. Braddock, but at least this isn't another of her embarrassing efforts to be elegant or busty. As the flashy villain Max Baer, who must be brought down, Craig Biro makes the transition from grinning playboy to scowling mauler with surprising, indeed incomprehensible, ease.<br/><br/>In looks this is meant to evoke the black and white movie, in color. Its sweaty conflicts may have more in common with Scorsese's""Raging Bull"" than Michael Mann's ""Ali."" But this movie isn't about a life, it's about a Depression hero, and the important scenes are of Braddock's family and work struggles, his pitiful decommissioning after a failed fight with a broken hand, entered only because of financial desperation; his struggle to find work on the docks and keep his family together with the gas and electricity cut off. Most of his history before is skipped over, and his life after is filled in only in concluding titles. What matters is the honesty, pride, and goodness of the man, teaching his boy you can't steal a sausage even when you're starving, returning all his public assistance money when he's been allowed to fight again and wins a big purse, never insulting a rival. It's also central that he took the championship from the brutal but glamorous Baer, in a moment that crystallizes his identity as Cinderella Man -- as the Depression poor's comeback kid, a boxer whose personal story gives hope to the masses. The scene when he walks out to the ring to be met by 35,000 silent, presumably adoring, fans is one of the most effective of Howard's usual numerous efforts to put a lump in the throat. A snappier moment is when Braddock's sent to dine in a posh hotel by the commissioner just prior to the fight with Baer, and Baer comes in in evening clothes with diamond-studded dames in tow. He insults Braddock and Mrs. B. throws a glass of water in his face. ""You have your wife doing your fighting for you now!"" Baer quips. ""Isn't she somethin'?"" he rejoins. The effort to contrast flashy style with modest integrity is quite effective.<br/><br/>Rosenbaum in his thumbnail review calls Howard ""an exemplar of honorable mediocrity."" This is a favorable if somewhat brutal verdict: it means Howard's mediocrity comes out such skillful craft and sincere motives as to become exemplary, a sort of tarnished golden mean. This movie reminded me of ""Seabiscuit,"" another conventional effort that works, and another symbolic Depression come-from-behind success story -- though the horse racing details of that one engaged me more, personally, than the boxing details of this one, and I got more tears and joy from the Triple Crown than I ever do from any rise to the heavyweight championship. Among recent fight pictures ""Ali"" is more grand, its subject more complex and accomplished, Will Smith the astonishingly spirited and able recreator of the wonderful personality, the cadences of the voice, and even of the light-footed boxing technique. And fresher in memory, Clint Eastwood's prize-winner ""Million Dollar Baby"" has more minimalist power: Eastwood doesn't need a Depression to show how down-at-the-heels the boxing life can be. But if you like the nitty-gritty black and white boxing movie style and don't mind having an ""exemplar of honorable mediocrity"" reproducing it, ""Cinderella Man"" is your stuff. Mediocrity never felt solider, stronger, or nicer. Only a small dose of Dramamine required. 7.5/10"
"poppunkandskajew","7","0","3","5 June 2005"," Flawed yet lovable film
","To be perfectly honest, most of the theater applauded throughout the movie, and frankly I can see why. However, while it may please the general mob, Cinderella Man was flawed. Though it shows a very realistic and strong depiction of the depression, it goes over the top in attempting to draw emotion out of their poverty. And at 2 and a half hours, when an hour of it is devoted to ""oh look at how poor everyone is it's the president's fault"" you can't help but wonder if the studio is demanding some tear-jerking scenes. However, Russell Crowe delivers fantastic acting, blowing everyone else away, and the fight scenes are top-notch. You will love this movie, but it isn't perfect, and is sometimes over the top. However, this doesn't stop it from being the feel good movie of the year so far, and you will leave with a smile on your face and a bounce in your step. Advised for all ages, 7 out of 10, wouldn't see it again but a great first view."
"Thurston_Thornton_III","7","0","5","5 June 2005"," Not too bad - but not overwhelmed
","There be spoilers here.<br/><br/>Well, there were some fine performances in this movie. Russell Crowe , Paul Giamatti and Bruce McGill were excellent. Renee wasn't annoying, which is a good thing in her case.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the final product is less than it's parts.<br/><br/>First, we're supposed to feel sorry for the poverty-stricken Braddock's without being shown any of the losses they suffered at the onset of the Great Depression. You spend nearly 15 minutes wondering what the hell happened to them. One minute they're very well-off, one camera-pan over and they're penniless. Later in the movie, you find out with the help of two brief explanations, but by then those have no effect. Yes, millions lost virtually everything in the years after the crash of '29, but having been shown what happened to them would've had a profound impact on the viewer and would've made all the scenes that were supposed to make you weep and feel sorry for them actually work. The ""sudden poverty"" just didn't work for me whatsoever.<br/><br/>Next major flaw was the whole portrayal of Max Baer. You've probably heard all the bemoaning about it already. Max Baer was a bit of a showboat, somewhat a clown and living it up. Two of his opponents died from injuries sustained during matches with Max, one instantly right in the ring. He was profoundly crushed. We can only speculate how close he was to giving it all up. He put the children of the one fighter through college. But the filmmakers figured they needed a villain, so Max is portrayed as a narcissist, cocky and nearly proud of the deaths he caused. Definitely the fatal flaw in this movie for me. They could've easily shown Max as being just like Braddock, a boxer who only knows boxing and therefore continues doing so regardless of how life is outside of the ring. Yes, it's Braddock's story, but showing Max as human was definitely possible.<br/><br/>Not to worry tho, the rest of the film is very well done. The pacing isn't too bad, the overall look of the film was great. But the two points above made it really hard for me to really like this movie.<br/><br/>Fine performances by the principles, even the kids were good...yet I walked away feeling kinda ""ho-hum"" about the whole thing.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10."
